cqds which are also referred as graphene graphene oxide quantum dots gqds goqds and carbon dots cds are an emerging class of carbon nanomaterials with various unique properties as illustrated in fig 1 a they are typically quasi spherical nanoparticles with amorphous to nanocrystalline cores that have diameters in the range of 3 20 nm baker and baker 2010 lim et al 2015 wang and hu 2014 they were first found during the purification of single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts in 2004 xu et al 2004 cqds contain considerable amounts of epoxy hydroxyl and carboxyl groups at their basal planes and surfaces and the o content ranges from 5 to 50 in weight depending on the synthetic route wang and hu 2014 these groups on the surface help to ensure excellent water solubility and provide versatile abilities for further functionalization and surface passivation since the discovery of cqds in 2004 the number of related publications about their syntheses properties and applications increased exponentially every year as shown in fig 1 b due to their benign abundant and inexpensive nature and size dependent optical properties cqds have gained growing prominence as new nanocarbon materials in various fields such as chemical sensing bioimaging biosensing photocatalysis and electrocatalysis hutton et al 2017 li et al 2012 2015 lim et al 2015 shen et al 2012 wang et al 2017 wu et al 2013 in particular their optical and fluorescence properties enable their applications in biosensing and bioimaging to replace conventional semiconductor quantum dots which possess high toxicity due to the use of heavy metals during their production another interesting application of cqds is chemical sensing like the detection of heavy metals such as hg2 by observing the fluorescence intensity difference of cqds zhang et al 2015 furthermore cqds capabilities of harvesting long wavelength light and exchanging energy with solution species endow them the feasibility to function as photocatalysts in organic syntheses hu et al 2013 li et al 2013 comparing to spherical tubular and sheet fillers cqds are a type of zero dimensional 0 d nanomaterial in the graphene family as a structure comprising a few layers of go cqds share most desirable features of go while possessing their own unique properties zhang and chung 2017 different from bulk go nanosheets cqds exhibit 0 d distinctive electronic and optical properties because of their large edge effects and quantum confinement which result in better peroxidase like activities than go nanosheets zheng et al 2013 furthermore 0 d cqds also exhibit lower cytotoxicity than micrometer sized graphene oxide sheets according to a long term in vivo study from the previous research nurunnabi et al 2013 in the field of membrane research go flakes have been incorporated into polymers to form various mixed matrix membranes but rarely in the form of thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes via interfacial polymerization zhang and chung 2017 this arises from the fact that go flakes generally have a thickness ranging from nanometers up to a few micrometers it is hard to wrap them in a polymer network and form a defect free selective layer because the thin films made from interfacial polymerization have a thickness of 0 2 1 Î¼m in addition the accumulation of go could not be completely avoided thus the nonselective boundary defects would be easily formed between the go sheets and the hosting polymer jiang et al 2016 cqds favorable properties such as nanoscale sizes rich chemistry antifouling properties suggest their potential for the fabrication of multi functional composite materials in addition their particular sizes shapes and surface chemistry allow them to be well dispersed in polar solvents e g water ethylene glycol and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone and polymer matrices which are essential characteristics for their applications in membrane formation and separation therefore the fabrications of cqd modified membranes have been explored to maximize membrane properties with substantially improved performance in multiple ways other than membrane modification cqds have also been employed in the forward osmosis process as the draw solutes and attained the highest reported water flux for seawater desalination guo et al 2014 although during the last few years the advances in cqd syntheses properties and applications in other fields have been comprehensively reviewed their progress in membrane technologies has not been summarized yet therefore in this feature article we aim to 1 summarize the state of art of cqd modified membranes for different applications and 2 elaborate on the challenges and future of cqds for membrane technologies 2 syntheses of cqds since the discovery of cqds in 2004 researchers have developed many simple and low cost routes to synthesize cqds with desired structure size and functionality for selective applications generally the synthetic approaches for cqds can be classified into two categories namely top down and bottom up lim et al 2015 the top down method involves breaking down larger pieces of carbon structures such as graphite carbon nanotubes and activated carbon by techniques like laser ablation electrochemical oxidation and arc discharge lin and zhang 2012 dong et al 2010 li et al 2012 sun et al 2006 zhou et al 2007 the first example of fluorescent cqds was found when xu and co workers were purifying swcnts produced from the oxidation process between arc discharged soot and nitric acid xu et al 2004 nevertheless syntheses of cqds from the top down method usually require costly precursors complex instrumental set ups and sophisticated processes in contrast via bottom up approaches researchers are able to produce cqds in bulk from cheaper precursors and by more common experimental set ups the bottom up method produces cqds from molecular precursors such as citrate carbohydrates and polymer silica nanocomposites through methods like hydrothermal solvothermal combustion treatment and microwave irradiation bourlinos et al 2008 li et al 2010 liu et al 2009 peng and travas sejdic 2009 recently many attempts have been made to deploy green materials as the precursors such as chitosan water melon peel orange sugar cane juice chicken egg and goose feather chowdhury et al 2012 liu et al 2015 mehta et al 2014 sahu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 yang et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 the as synthesized cqd fragments can be purified and have a controlled size via post treatments like filtration dialysis centrifugation column chromatography and gel electrophoresis wang and hu 2014 for membrane applications most researchers have produced cqds from the pyrolysis of citric acid by thermal hydrothermal solvothermal or microwave assisted treatments owing to the low cost of raw materials simplicity high yield and narrow particle size distribution guo et al 2014 the degree of carbonization particle size and functional groups on cqd surfaces vary delicately with the pyrolysis temperature duration and surrounding such as ambient air solvent and other reactive substance in most of the related studies cqds were prepared by pyrolyzing citric acid directly bi et al 2018 jafari et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 the temperature for pyrolysis ranged from 180 to 200 c while the carbonization duration differed from 15 min to 3 h resulting in cqds with average diameter in the range of 2 nm 11 nm fig 2 shows typical tem images of cqds prepared by this approach and their particle size distribution zhao et al 2017 zeng s group produced cqds for the modification of uf membranes via the top down method zeng et al 2016 their cx 72 carbon black went through a hydrothermal oxidation by refluxing it in a concentrated nitric acid hno3 solution for 24 h at 110 c the prepared cqds exhibited an average diameter of 5 5 nm functionalization and surface passivation of cqds during preparation or post treatment are important for specific applications the introduction of various functional groups such as amines can tune fluorescence and physical properties of cqds in the case of membrane fabrication the surface chemistry of cqds would be rationally tuned in order to achieve better membrane stability and performance fathizadeh s team equipped cqds with amine groups by the carbonization of citric acid with ammonia through a hydrothermal treatment at 180 c for 24 h fathizadeh et al 2017 the terminal amine groups helped to form chemical bonds between the polyamide matrix and cqds leading to a more stable dispersion of cqds in the polyamide matrix yuan et al synthesized cqds through one step microwave assisted pyrolysis through inter and intra molecular dehydration between citric acid and ethylenediamine yuan et al 2018 the tailored surface groups facilitated the incorporation of cqds into the polyethylenediamine matrix and formed the composite membranes for polar solvent transport across the membranes gai and he synthesized na functionalized cqds to further improve the hydrophilicity of cqds and consequently gave rise to membrane hydrophilicity and water transport for the production of osmotic energy via pressure retarded osmosis pro and heavy metal removal via nanofiltration nf gai et al 2018 he et al 2018 3 membrane development and applications unlike go sheets cqds can be readily integrated into the state of the art membranes e g ro nf and pro membranes by taking advantages of their small sizes and rich surface functional groups that can form chemical bonds with other compounds as shown in fig 3 one can selectively engineer only the dense selective layer or the substrate layer as well as the entire membranes by cqds depending on the applications the first approach fig 3 a has the advantages of minimizing the material usage cost and maximizing the membrane performance because only the dense selective layer has cqds the second approach fig 3 b can potentially mitigate the inherent limitations of polymeric substrates such as weak mechanical properties and hydrophobicity made from conventional polymers such as polysulfone psf polyethersulfone pes polyvinylidene pvdf and polyacrylonitrile pan therefore cqds are a new class of nano fillers to modify membranes 3 1 thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes in the past few years many research groups have demonstrated the modification of selective skins by the addition of cqds typically cqds are dispersed in the aqueous phase and subsequently participate in the interfacial polymerization process to form tfn membranes cqd modified tfn membranes are able to outperform the pristine ones even with a small addition of cqds in the water phase the resultant membranes exhibit enhanced surface hydrophilicity and greater permeability with retention of solute selectivity excellent stability and improved antifouling properties the utmost performance of tfn membranes can be further improved by proper functionalization of cqds and optimization of their amount several studies have shown that cqds can be successfully incorporated into the interfacial polymerization process with different monomers and substrates leading to a flux improvement varying from 50 to 6 8 times zhang and colleagues developed tfn membranes comprising cqds with an average diameter of 3 5 nm in a tannic acid film by an interfacial polymerization reaction on a pan substrate for low pressure nf processes zhang et al 2017 during the interfacial polymerization the hydroxyl groups of cqds and tannic acid reacted with the isocyanate groups of isophorone diisocyanate to form a selective skin in another study cqds with an average diameter of 11 nm were dispersed in a m phenylenediamine mpd aqueous solution and subsequently incorporated in the polyamide layer by interfacial polymerization reaction between mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc on the psf substrate for ro applications song et al 2016 part of the carboxyl groups on cqds first reacted with the amine groups of mpd in the aqueous solution followed by some of the remaining carboxyl groups forming covalent bonds via condensation reactions with the terminal carboxyl groups of tmc in the interfacial polymerization besides the enhancement of water flux without compromising the salt rejection the introduction of cqds also resulted in membranes with greater chlorine resistance this would help long term operations because it was known that feed solutions containing chlorine could degrade the polyamide layer and jeopardize the membrane rejection bi et al embedded cqds into the polyamide layer during the interfacial polymerization of piperazine pip and tmc on the pes support for nf processes bi et al 2018 the amine groups of piperazine and hydroxyl or carboxyl groups of cqds would react with the acyl chloride groups of tmc at the oil water phase zone during the interfacial polymerization resulting in an ultrathin polyamide layer on the porous substrate the properties of the selective layer such as thickness roughness and surface hydrophilicity would be changed after the introduction of cqds it was found that cqds might hinder the process of interfacial polymerization because 1 the size of cqds was larger than other monomers such as tannic acid and mpd and 2 the aqueous concentration increased with the addition of cqds zhang et al 2017 as a result the steric hindrance induced by cqds decreased the diffusion rate of the monomers and retarded the rapid formation of the dense selective layer during the interfacial polymerization leading to a smoother surface moreover the addition of cqds in the water phase results in the enhancement of surface hydrophilicity cqds are usually negatively charged over a wide ph range owing to the deprotonation of cooh to coo groups the increment of surface hydrophilicity can enhance the permeate flux without a significant sacrifice in rejection for instance comparing with the pristine tannic acid tfc membrane for a low pressure nf process under 0 2 mpa cqd tfn membranes maintained high rejections to congo red of 99 8 and methylene blue of 97 6 with a pure water flux of 23 33 l m 2 h 1 abbreviated as lmh which was 1 5 times of the unmodified one zhang et al 2017 in a recent work the cqd incorporated tfn membrane showed a water flux 6 8 times of the unmodified polyamide nf membrane under 0 2 mpa while the rejection of congo red was kept above 96 bi et al 2018 in addition since lowly carbonated cqds could efficiently adsorb polar solvents by the hydrophilic groups the addition of cqds could not only suppress the transport of non polar solvents but also enhance the membrane selectivity in an organic solvent nanofiltration osn process yuan et al 2018 furthermore bi and colleagues found that cqds incorporated tfn membranes exhibited a steady water flux that was about 4 times of the pristine polyamide membrane under harsh fouling conditions bi et al 2018 the enhanced antifouling properties found by incorporating cqds in the selective layer may arise from two aspects firstly the negative charges on the selective layer can produce strong electrostatic repulsions between the negatively charged foulants like bsa and humic acid and the surface of the selective layer however the role of surface charges in complex real water remains debatable ostuni et al 2001 and further investigations are necessary secondly the improvement in surface hydrophilicity and the decrease in surface roughness weaken the interactions between the foulants and membrane surface and hence reduce the non specific adsorption the cqd modified tfn membranes exhibit higher chlorine resistance according to song et al s work chlorine detergents are widely used in practical ro processes as disinfectants and membrane cleaning agents however hydrogen bonds in the polyamide matrix are vulnerable to active chlorine which causes partial destruction of the polyamide layer and loss of salt rejection cqds help slow down this process by two possible ways first the hydrogen bonds between cqds and the polyamide layer make the polymer chains more compact and inhibit the replacement of amidic hydrogens another possibility lies in the charge exclusion between coo from electron rich cqds and active chlorine ocl this impedes the contact of ocl with the membrane surface and also the diffusion of ocl in the polyamide matrix in an extended ro test song et al 2016 the cqd modified tfn membranes displayed a stable flux and rejection suggesting their outstanding durability which is greatly desired in desalination and water reclamation processes 3 2 cqd polymer composite membranes as shown in fig 3 b the second approach is to add cqds in polymer dopes to form homogeneous solutions and fabricate mixed matric membranes through various spinning methods the small size of cqds can result in better dispersion of particles in dope solutions and the formation of membranes with a more uniform structure without compromising the overall mechanical strength one challenge for this method is to find a suitable solvent for both cqds and the polymer another challenge is how to control the cqd distribution within the membranes jiang et al 2005 additionally leaching of nanoparticles could be a problem for all kinds of nanoparticle embedded membranes therefore scientists must 1 identify practical means to form chemical bonding between cqds and the polymeric matrix and 2 ensure long term stability of cqds inside the membrane the addition of cqds in dopes may have different impacts on dope rheology membrane formation and morphology jafari s group prepared cqds polyvinylidene pvdf electrospun membranes for air gap membrane distillation agmd the resultant membrane exhibited a more compact structure and rougher surface after adding cqds compared to the neat pvdf membrane jafari et al 2018 the prepared cqds pvdf nanofibrous membranes exhibited higher wetting resistance than the neat pvdf membranes during the 60 h test in accordance with their more compact membrane morphology safaei and colleagues dispersed cqds together with pan in dmf with the loadings of 1 25 2 5 and 5 mg ml and fabricated cqds pan composite nanofibers through the electrospinning procedure safaei et al 2017 the increment in dope viscosity after adding cqds gave rise to the average diameter of the composite nanofibers than the neat ones these nanofibers could be potentially applied in areas like photochemical reactions and bioimaging colbum s team used an ionic liquid 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium acetate as the common solvent for both cqds and cellulose to create uniform membrane properties colburn et al 2018 cqds are bound with the cellulose domain through hydrogen bond networks and a stable composite membrane was formed the presence of cqds on the surface can also make the membrane negatively charged and more hydrophilic in addition cqds can act as pore formers indicated by the fesem images of membranes cross section and endow membranes with a higher permeability 3 3 membranes with cqds on top of substrates another method is to coat cqds on top of membrane surface with the aid of various coating agents like polydopamine pda and 3 aminopropy trimethoxysilane aptms fig 3 c immobilization of cqds via covalent bonding between oxygen containing groups on cqds and amine containing agents on membrane surface is a feasible method zeng and co workers anchored cqds on pvdf membrane surface via three steps zeng et al 2016 for uf applications they first hydroxylated the pvdf membrane surface via helium plasma induced grafting of polyethylene glycol peg the peg modified pvdf membrane was then treated with aptms to introduce amine groups finally covalent linkages were formed between carboxylic groups on cqds and amine groups on the pvdf surface zhao et al synthesized cqds consisting of carboxyl groups so that part of these groups could react with nh2 from the polydopamine coated pes substrate with enhanced antifouling resistance zhao et al 2017 due to the fluorescence property of cqds and the larger loading amount of cqds on membrane surface the existence of cqds could be observed under fluorescence microscopy with the excitation of uv light fig 4 the origin of the fluorescence properties remained debatable and several possible mechanisms were raised such as the quantum effect defects and surface state surface passivation and conjugated Ï domains nevertheless one may explore this fascinating property of cqds to characterize interactions among foulants and membrane materials backwash efficiency as well as sensors to monitor water quality and compositions in these cases as the cqd loading on membrane surface is significant another favorable property of cqds takes effect namely the anti biofouling property especially in terms of inhibiting biofilm formation although systematic examination on their antibacterial property is still lacking chen et al 2017 hui et al 2015 researchers in the membrane field have ascribed the superior anti biofouling property of cqds to three aspects firstly bacteria usually have an overall negative charge on the cell surface due to the existence of peptidoglycan in the cell wall since the cqd surface also has the negatively charged carboxyl groups there is an electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and bacteria surface zhao et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 in addition although part of bacteria can still get close to the membrane surface the highly dispersed cqds with an ultra small size and large specific surface area may directly insert or cut the bacteria cells zeng et al 2016 furthermore the oxidative stress is another reason for the death of bacterial cells the homogeneous and high loading of cqds on the membrane surface relative to go sheets with a lateral dimension facilitates exposure of a larger fraction of active edges leading to a higher oxidative stress this hypothesis has been proven by the glutathione gsh oxidation in vitro tests as gsh is a tripeptide molecule with thiol groups that protect cellular components from the oxidative stress the results show that the cqd pvdf membrane 63 3 of gsh oxidized has an oxidative stress almost 3 times higher than the go pvdf membrane 22 1 of gsh oxidized zeng et al 2016 subsequently vital cellular components could be oxidized or disrupted by cqds it is particularly noteworthy that the mechanisms of cqd enabled disinfection are nonselective towards bacteria thus providing the opportunities to develop cqd based and non specific bacteria killing membrane technologies nonetheless more fundamental studies are needed on the bacteria activity of cqd functionalized membranes such as the exact contribution of electrostatic repulsion physical or oxidative stress and all other possible pathways however it is necessary to bear in mind that to solve the fouling problem caused by microorganisms we cannot depend solely on the enhancement of membranes anti biofouling property to avoid rapid fouling of a membrane pretreatment of feed water is usually necessary most of bacteria can be removed during the pretreatment process while the residue of them will grow biofilm on the membrane the function of an antifouling membrane is not to totally eliminate bacteria but to slower this process when biofilm is formed and the membrane performance is significantly jeopardized membrane wash by chemical or physical methods should be conducted however a membrane with less fouling tendency requires less membrane wash and thus the operation and maintenance costs can be saved besides being applied in membrane modification cqd derived carbon nanoparticles can also function as draw solutes in fo processes guo et al 2014 the unique characteristics of na functionalized cqds na cqds including large surface area abundant carboxyl groups and rich ionic species favor high osmotic pressure and thus fo water flux in fo tests with pure water as the feed solution the na cqds 0 4 g ml 1 showed a water flux of 29 8 lmh exceeding that of a 2 0 m nacl draw solution by 55 when seawater was used as the feed solution the na cqds provide a fo water flux of 10 4 lmh with only a slight drop after 5 cycles in addition the na cqds showed a negligible reverse flux of the draw solute 4 outlook and future work in the last three years pioneering researches on cqd incorporated membranes have been initiated for various applications such as water reuse and reclamation seawater desalination organic solvent reuse and clean energy generation however there are still many challenges ahead the major challenges are 1 to fundamentally understand and manipulate the functionality of cqds and 2 to rationally design and synthesize cqds by facial methods from low cost precursors with a high yield and various functionalities for different applications commercialization of cqd incorporated membranes for water reuse and seawater desalination is too early to predict in order to maximize the cqd performance one must understand the science and engineering on how to manipulate the cqd distribution within the membranes during the phase inversion membrane casting and spinning processes basic research on fundamental mechanisms of cqds on membrane performance in different separation processes should be probed for example the effects of cqd addition on 1 phase inversion and 2 interfacial polymerization must be understood from thermodynamics and kinetic aspects in order to predict membrane performance it is also imperative to systemically investigate some unique functions of cqd modified membranes such as how they inhibit biofilm formation their possible toxicity towards microorganisms and related physiological effects should be in depth evaluated before being commercialized currently the properties of cqds with the same name vary remarkably in the literature owing to their heterogeneity in size shape and surface property the scientific community must unify and make them easy for comparison furthermore because of their multiple functionalities exploration of cqds in other membrane based separation processes such as gas separation and others should be encouraged finally although the carbonaceous nature of cqds endows them environmentally friendliness the use of cqds especially in water treatment technologies still possibly increases the risk of exposure to cqds through occupational environmental and drinking water channels therefore future research must include the strategies to limit the release of cqds as well as to monitor the cqds leaching into drinking water owing to their ultra small size there is an urgent need to anchor them on membranes via easy and practical chemical bonding to avoid cqd leaching and degeneration of membrane performance 5 conclusions in this review we have summarized the recent progresses in the field of cqd modified membranes especially for water related separation processes the advent of cqd research has heralded a new chapter in membrane technologies although most cqd modified membranes are still in the research stage their applications for modern water reuse and seawater desalination are foreseeable due to their comparatively low cost and unique advantages in addition the incorporation of cqds into current membranes is easier because of their nano size and rich functionality despite of recent progresses more fundamental researches and in depth studies on their membrane formation anti fouling mechanism biofilm growth and toxicity are required for better science advancement and

development and applications unlike go sheets cqds can be readily integrated into the state of the art membranes e g ro nf and pro membranes by taking advantages of their small sizes and rich surface functional groups that can form chemical bonds with other compounds as shown in fig 3 one can selectively engineer only the dense selective layer or the substrate layer as well as the entire membranes by cqds depending on the applications the first approach fig 3 a has the advantages of minimizing the material usage cost and maximizing the membrane performance because only the dense selective layer has cqds the second approach fig 3 b can potentially mitigate the inherent limitations of polymeric substrates such as weak mechanical properties and hydrophobicity made from conventional polymers such as polysulfone psf polyethersulfone pes polyvinylidene pvdf and polyacrylonitrile pan therefore cqds are a new class of nano fillers to modify membranes 3 1 thin film nanocomposite tfn membranes in the past few years many research groups have demonstrated the modification of selective skins by the addition of cqds typically cqds are dispersed in the aqueous phase and subsequently participate in the interfacial polymerization process to form tfn membranes cqd modified tfn membranes are able to outperform the pristine ones even with a small addition of cqds in the water phase the resultant membranes exhibit enhanced surface hydrophilicity and greater permeability with retention of solute selectivity excellent stability and improved antifouling properties the utmost performance of tfn membranes can be further improved by proper functionalization of cqds and optimization of their amount several studies have shown that cqds can be successfully incorporated into the interfacial polymerization process with different monomers and substrates leading to a flux improvement varying from 50 to 6 8 times zhang and colleagues developed tfn membranes comprising cqds with an average diameter of 3 5 nm in a tannic acid film by an interfacial polymerization reaction on a pan substrate for low pressure nf processes zhang et al 2017 during the interfacial polymerization the hydroxyl groups of cqds and tannic acid reacted with the isocyanate groups of isophorone diisocyanate to form a selective skin in another study cqds with an average diameter of 11 nm were dispersed in a m phenylenediamine mpd aqueous solution and subsequently incorporated in the polyamide layer by interfacial polymerization reaction between mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc on the psf substrate for ro applications song et al 2016 part of the carboxyl groups on cqds first reacted with the amine groups of mpd in the aqueous solution followed by some of the remaining carboxyl groups forming covalent bonds via condensation reactions with the terminal carboxyl groups of tmc in the interfacial polymerization besides the enhancement of water flux without compromising the salt rejection the introduction of cqds also resulted in membranes with greater chlorine resistance this would help long term operations because it was known that feed solutions containing chlorine could degrade the polyamide layer and jeopardize the membrane rejection bi et al embedded cqds into the polyamide layer during the interfacial polymerization of piperazine pip and tmc on the pes support for nf processes bi et al 2018 the amine groups of piperazine and hydroxyl or carboxyl groups of cqds would react with the acyl chloride groups of tmc at the oil water phase zone during the interfacial polymerization resulting in an ultrathin polyamide layer on the porous substrate the properties of the selective layer such as thickness roughness and surface hydrophilicity would be changed after the introduction of cqds it was found that cqds might hinder the process of interfacial polymerization because 1 the size of cqds was larger than other monomers such as tannic acid and mpd and 2 the aqueous concentration increased with the addition of cqds zhang et al 2017 as a result the steric hindrance induced by cqds decreased the diffusion rate of the monomers and retarded the rapid formation of the dense selective layer during the interfacial polymerization leading to a smoother surface moreover the addition of cqds in the water phase results in the enhancement of surface hydrophilicity cqds are usually negatively charged over a wide ph range owing to the deprotonation of cooh to coo groups the increment of surface hydrophilicity can enhance the permeate flux without a significant sacrifice in rejection for instance comparing with the pristine tannic acid tfc membrane for a low pressure nf process under 0 2 mpa cqd tfn membranes maintained high rejections to congo red of 99 8 and methylene blue of 97 6 with a pure water flux of 23 33 l m 2 h 1 abbreviated as lmh which was 1 5 times of the unmodified one zhang et al 2017 in a recent work the cqd incorporated tfn membrane showed a water flux 6 8 times of the unmodified polyamide nf membrane under 0 2 mpa while the rejection of congo red was kept above 96 bi et al 2018 in addition since lowly carbonated cqds could efficiently adsorb polar solvents by the hydrophilic groups the addition of cqds could not only suppress the transport of non polar solvents but also enhance the membrane selectivity in an organic solvent nanofiltration osn process yuan et al 2018 furthermore bi and colleagues found that cqds incorporated tfn membranes exhibited a steady water flux that was about 4 times of the pristine polyamide membrane under harsh fouling conditions bi et al 2018 the enhanced antifouling properties found by incorporating cqds in the selective layer may arise from two aspects firstly the negative charges on the selective layer can produce strong electrostatic repulsions between the negatively charged foulants like bsa and humic acid and the surface of the selective layer however the role of surface charges in complex real water remains debatable ostuni et al 2001 and further investigations are necessary secondly the improvement in surface hydrophilicity and the decrease in surface roughness weaken the interactions between the foulants and membrane surface and hence reduce the non specific adsorption the cqd modified tfn membranes exhibit higher chlorine resistance according to song et al s work chlorine detergents are widely used in practical ro processes as disinfectants and membrane cleaning agents however hydrogen bonds in the polyamide matrix are vulnerable to active chlorine which causes partial destruction of the polyamide layer and loss of salt rejection cqds help slow down this process by two possible ways first the hydrogen bonds between cqds and the polyamide layer make the polymer chains more compact and inhibit the replacement of amidic hydrogens another possibility lies in the charge exclusion between coo from electron rich cqds and active chlorine ocl this impedes the contact of ocl with the membrane surface and also the diffusion of ocl in the polyamide matrix in an extended ro test song et al 2016 the cqd modified tfn membranes displayed a stable flux and rejection suggesting their outstanding durability which is greatly desired in desalination and water reclamation processes 3 2 cqd polymer composite membranes as shown in fig 3 b the second approach is to add cqds in polymer dopes to form homogeneous solutions and fabricate mixed matric membranes through various spinning methods the small size of cqds can result in better dispersion of particles in dope solutions and the formation of membranes with a more uniform structure without compromising the overall mechanical strength one challenge for this method is to find a suitable solvent for both cqds and the polymer another challenge is how to control the cqd distribution within the membranes jiang et al 2005 additionally leaching of nanoparticles could be a problem for all kinds of nanoparticle embedded membranes therefore scientists must 1 identify practical means to form chemical bonding between cqds and the polymeric matrix and 2 ensure long term stability of cqds inside the membrane the addition of cqds in dopes may have different impacts on dope rheology membrane formation and morphology jafari s group prepared cqds polyvinylidene pvdf electrospun membranes for air gap membrane distillation agmd the resultant membrane exhibited a more compact structure and rougher surface after adding cqds compared to the neat pvdf membrane jafari et al 2018 the prepared cqds pvdf nanofibrous membranes exhibited higher wetting resistance than the neat pvdf membranes during the 60 h test in accordance with their more compact membrane morphology safaei and colleagues dispersed cqds together with pan in dmf with the loadings of 1 25 2 5 and 5 mg ml and fabricated cqds pan composite nanofibers through the electrospinning procedure safaei et al 2017 the increment in dope viscosity after adding cqds gave rise to the average diameter of the composite nanofibers than the neat ones these nanofibers could be potentially applied in areas like photochemical reactions and bioimaging colbum s team used an ionic liquid 1 ethyl 3 methylimidazolium acetate as the common solvent for both cqds and cellulose to create uniform membrane properties colburn et al 2018 cqds are bound with the cellulose domain through hydrogen bond networks and a stable composite membrane was formed the presence of cqds on the surface can also make the membrane negatively charged and more hydrophilic in addition cqds can act as pore formers indicated by the fesem images of membranes cross section and endow membranes with a higher permeability 3 3 membranes with cqds on top of substrates another method is to coat cqds on top of membrane surface with the aid of various coating agents like polydopamine pda and 3 aminopropy trimethoxysilane aptms fig 3 c immobilization of cqds via covalent bonding between oxygen containing groups on cqds and amine containing agents on membrane surface is a feasible method zeng and co workers anchored cqds on pvdf membrane surface via three steps zeng et al 2016 for uf applications they first hydroxylated the pvdf membrane surface via helium plasma induced grafting of polyethylene glycol peg the peg modified pvdf membrane was then treated with aptms to introduce amine groups finally covalent linkages were formed between carboxylic groups on cqds and amine groups on the pvdf surface zhao et al synthesized cqds consisting of carboxyl groups so that part of these groups could react with nh2 from the polydopamine coated pes substrate with enhanced antifouling resistance zhao et al 2017 due to the fluorescence property of cqds and the larger loading amount of cqds on membrane surface the existence of cqds could be observed under fluorescence microscopy with the excitation of uv light fig 4 the origin of the fluorescence properties remained debatable and several possible mechanisms were raised such as the quantum effect defects and surface state surface passivation and conjugated Ï domains nevertheless one may explore this fascinating property of cqds to characterize interactions among foulants and membrane materials backwash efficiency as well as sensors to monitor water quality and compositions in these cases as the cqd loading on membrane surface is significant another favorable property of cqds takes effect namely the anti biofouling property especially in terms of inhibiting biofilm formation although systematic examination on their antibacterial property is still lacking chen et al 2017 hui et al 2015 researchers in the membrane field have ascribed the superior anti biofouling property of cqds to three aspects firstly bacteria usually have an overall negative charge on the cell surface due to the existence of peptidoglycan in the cell wall since the cqd surface also has the negatively charged carboxyl groups there is an electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and bacteria surface zhao et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 in addition although part of bacteria can still get close to the membrane surface the highly dispersed cqds with an ultra small size and large specific surface area may directly insert or cut the bacteria cells zeng et al 2016 furthermore the oxidative stress is another reason for the death of bacterial cells the homogeneous and high loading of cqds on the membrane surface relative to go sheets with a lateral dimension facilitates exposure of a larger fraction of active edges leading to a higher oxidative stress this hypothesis has been proven by the glutathione gsh oxidation in vitro tests as gsh is a tripeptide molecule with thiol groups that protect cellular components from the oxidative stress the results show that the cqd pvdf membrane 63 3 of gsh oxidized has an oxidative stress almost 3 times higher than the go pvdf membrane 22 1 of gsh oxidized zeng et al 2016 subsequently vital cellular components could be oxidized or disrupted by cqds it is particularly noteworthy that the mechanisms of cqd enabled disinfection are nonselective towards bacteria thus providing the opportunities to develop cqd based and non specific bacteria killing membrane technologies nonetheless more fundamental studies are needed on the bacteria activity of cqd functionalized membranes such as the exact contribution of electrostatic repulsion physical or oxidative stress and all other possible pathways however it is necessary to bear in mind that to solve the fouling problem caused by microorganisms we cannot depend solely on the enhancement of membranes anti biofouling property to avoid rapid fouling of a membrane pretreatment of feed water is usually necessary most of bacteria can be removed during the pretreatment process while the residue of them will grow biofilm on the membrane the function of an antifouling membrane is not to totally eliminate bacteria but to slower this process when biofilm is formed and the membrane performance is significantly jeopardized membrane wash by chemical or physical methods should be conducted however a membrane with less fouling tendency requires less membrane wash and thus the operation and maintenance costs can be saved besides being applied in membrane modification cqd derived carbon nanoparticles can also function as draw solutes in fo processes guo et al 2014 the unique characteristics of na functionalized cqds na cqds including large surface area abundant carboxyl groups and rich ionic species favor high osmotic pressure and thus fo water flux in fo tests with pure water as the feed solution the na cqds 0 4 g ml 1 showed a water flux of 29 8 lmh exceeding that of a 2 0 m nacl draw solution by 55 when seawater was used as the feed solution the na cqds provide a fo water flux of 10 4 lmh with only a slight drop after 5 cycles in addition the na cqds showed a negligible reverse flux of the draw solute 4 outlook and future work in the last three years pioneering researches on cqd incorporated membranes have been initiated for various applications such as water reuse and reclamation seawater desalination organic solvent reuse and clean energy generation however there are still many challenges ahead the major challenges are 1 to fundamentally understand and manipulate the functionality of cqds and 2 to rationally design and synthesize cqds by facial methods from low cost precursors with a high yield and various functionalities for different applications commercialization of cqd incorporated membranes for water reuse and seawater desalination is too early to predict in order to maximize the cqd performance one must understand the science and engineering on how to manipulate the cqd distribution within the membranes during the phase inversion membrane casting and spinning processes basic research on fundamental mechanisms of cqds on membrane performance in different separation processes should be probed for example the effects of cqd addition on 1 phase inversion and 2 interfacial polymerization must be understood from thermodynamics and kinetic aspects in order to predict membrane performance it is also imperative to systemically investigate some unique functions of cqd modified membranes such as how they inhibit biofilm formation their possible toxicity towards microorganisms and related physiological effects should be in depth evaluated before being commercialized currently the properties of cqds with the same name vary remarkably in the literature owing to their heterogeneity in size shape and surface property the scientific community must unify and make them easy for comparison furthermore because of their multiple functionalities exploration of cqds in other membrane based separation processes such as gas separation and others should be encouraged finally although the carbonaceous nature of cqds endows them environmentally friendliness the use of cqds especially in water treatment technologies still possibly increases the risk of exposure to cqds through occupational environmental and drinking water channels therefore future research must include the strategies to limit the release of cqds as well as to monitor the cqds leaching into drinking water owing to their ultra small size there is an urgent need to anchor them on membranes via easy and practical chemical bonding to avoid cqd leaching and degeneration of membrane performance 5 conclusions in this review we have summarized the recent progresses in the field of cqd modified membranes especially for water related separation processes the advent of cqd research has heralded a new chapter in membrane technologies although most cqd modified membranes are still in the research stage their applications for modern water reuse and seawater desalination are foreseeable due to their comparatively low cost and unique advantages in addition the incorporation of cqds into current membranes is easier because of their nano size and rich functionality despite of recent progresses more fundamental researches and in depth studies on their membrane formation anti fouling mechanism biofilm growth and toxicity are required for better science advancement and

19226,wastewater treatment has an important responsibility to react to changing consumer and industrial produced wastes that pose environmental challenges surfactants are one of these emerging contaminants they are of interest because of their increasingly ubiquitous domestic and industrial use and the difficulty their presence causes traditional treatment in response to this developing area this critical review considers research from a variety of technical backgrounds to provide an up to date overview of the impact of surfactants on the environment health and their removal this found major concerns about surfactants on the environment and on health being corroborated in the past five years current research into removal focuses on existing biological and chemical wastewater treatment optimisation despite improvements being found to traditional biological methods using chemical pre treatments there is a clear lack of consensus regarding the ideal strategy drawbacks and potential solutions for a range of these technologies including fenton reaction and aerobic degradation are discussed in this field the authors recommend an improved diversity in surfactants used for the research and addressing of significant knowledge gaps novel methods such as carbon nanotube cnt use are also discussed these methods while showing promising results will require continual research effort to resolve present issues such as variable performance and environmental concerns larger scale work is also needed to validate the initial work done potential uses of surfactants to optimise wastewater treatment such as surfactant modified zeolites smzs are also discussed this review finds that surfactant removal from wastewater is a promising and challenging field that warrants further investigation keywords surfactant wastewater fenton zeolite carbon nanotube 1 introduction treating emerging contaminants such as surfactants is one of the major challenges facing wastewater treatment surfactants are a particularly challenging member of this group this is because of the wide usage and range of surfactants and their negative impact both on the wastewater treatment process and more importantly on the environment surfactants surface active agents are amphiphilic molecules containing two distinct parts a hydrophilic group and a lipophilic group yuan et al 2014 and can be broadly defined as compounds that alter the energy relationships at interfaces often in terms of altering either the surface or interfacial tension glassman 1948 when present in low concentrations surfactants reduce the amount of interfacial free energy required to alter the interfacial or surface area and promote the expansion of one of the interfaces within the system rosen 1972 thereby improving the efficiency of numerous processes hoffmann 1990 as a result surfactants are widely used as wetting agents detergents and emulsifying agents glassman 1948 whilst other surfactants such as quaternary ammonium compounds qacs have also been noted to damage the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and so can be used as disinfectants mcdonnell and russell 1999 the basic structure of a surfactant is shown as fig 1 surfactants use is extremely common and has been growing since the 1980s from the 1 7 million tons used in 1984 and the 9 3 million tons used in 1995 aboulhassan et al 2006 to the 15 93 million tons used in 2014 and the expected 24 19 million tons used in 2022 market wired 2017 numerous industries utilise surfactants notably the textile industry but also in the pharmaceutical cosmetic mining oil recovery and paper industries patel et al 1999 aboulhassan et al 2006 although it should be noted that in 2014 homecare accounted for more than 40 of the global market market wired 2017 however whilst the global market for surfactants is growing there has also been increasing concern with regards to the harm surfactants cause to the environment especially from wastewater petroviÄ et al 2003 bolong et al 2009 rebello et al 2013 there are numerous papers published regarding the negative effect that surfactants had on the environment wildlife and humans hera 2002 hera 2013 venhuis and mehrvar 2004 report that linear alkylbenzene sulphonates las has been noted to amongst other effects damage fish gills alter swimming patterns in the larvae of blue mussels and cause excess mucus secretion as well as in the common goby reduce respiration numerous other studies and reviews have reported on the toxicity of a variety of different surfactants lewis and suprenant 1983 hall et al 1989 liwarska bizukojc et al 2005 azizullah et al 2012 lechuga et al 2016 as well as their effect on the environment cserhÃ¡ti et al 2002 mostly with a focus on a variety of aquatic organisms acute toxicity tests show that there is a large range in lc50 values from species to species and can range from 210 to 500 000 Î¼g l for non ionic surfactants 80 to 2 800 000 Î¼g l for cationic surfactants and 110 to 92 000 Î¼g l for anionic surfactants lewis and suprenant 1983 many of the surfactants tested were found to be toxic enough that they can be classified as very toxic toxic and harmful according to european union directive 67 548 eec lechuga et al 2016 other studies have noted that the surfactants can increase the amount of organic hydrocarbon compounds that are solubilised into water sources or be sorbed into soils and sediments where it could potentially become harmful to crops whilst also affecting the degradation of hydrophobic organic compounds ying 2006 further studies have noted that whilst there can be a high amount of removal of some surfactants more than 99 of las venhuis and mehrvar 2004 the remaining surfactant that ends up rivers and other water sources can bioaccumulate within certain species tolls et al 2000 resulting in biotransformation of tissues in addition to this it has been shown that exposure to some surfactants such as benzalkonium chlorides bacs can increase antibiotic resistance in microbes tandukar et al 2013 these concerns have in europe led to much tighter regulation in terms of surfactant biodegradability and their phosphorous compounds and phosphates content european commission 2000 in the usa any surfactants that bypass sewage treatment have to meet specific criteria epa 2016 despite the increase in regulation removal of surfactants from wastewater is still a growing concern especially considering the high toxicity and ubiquity of surfactants this is reflected by a steady increase in the number of publications considering both surfactants and wastewater treatment web of science 2017 however it is worth noting to the reader that many of these publications do not consider surfactants as their primary aim in general there is a lack of focus on surfactant challenges in the wastewater treatment process despite the overall increase in publications seen in the literature a holistic overview of surfactant s impact on the wastewater treatment process is often missing from the literature addressing the subject there is therefore a need for an up to date review of the topic this review will consider the breadth of current treatment methods used to remove commonly used anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants work in the literature to improve these techniques and novel removal attempts and strategies to utilise surfactants in wastewater treatment it is intended that this approach motivates further research into promising areas found in this review to tackle this important emerging issue in wastewater engineering 2 current treatment methods 2 1 surfactant types diversity and occurrence in wastewater part of the challenge facing current treatment methods is that there are a wide variety of surfactants with different characteristics within the surfactant market there are three main categories of surfactant anionic cationic and non ionic classification of a surfactant is normally done using the electrical charge on the hydrophilic part of the surfactant molecule anionic surfactants contain a negatively charged hydrophilic group such as a carboxyl or sulfonate whilst cationic surfactants contain a positively charged hydrophilic group such as quaternary ammonium or phosphonium glassman 1948 non ionic surfactants on the other hand have a non ionised hydrophilic group such as polymerized ethylene oxide glassman 1948 anionic surfactants are the most common and in 2009 accounted for around 60 of the world s surfactant production whilst non ionic surfactants accounted for 30 and amphoteric and cationic surfactants 10 aloui et al 2009 surfactants also have the potential to be zwitterionic with both negative and positive charges in the hydrophilic head gerola et al 2017 an example is cocamidopropyl betaine zhou et al 2017 this surfactant class is only just starting to attract attention in the literature from the treatment perspective for example merkova et al 2018 this review therefore focuses on the commonly researched surfactants outlined in table 1 other important emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated and organosilicone surfactants are also considered when possible although these are yet to attract significant attention in the literature from a removal perspective another potential challenge to removal methods could be the presence of multiple types of surfactant in wastewater a short literature review of surfactant occurrence and compositions in wastewaters highlights this issue and is presented in table 2 the review of wastewater samples found that the highest concentrations in wastewaters were for anionic surfactants cationic surfactants were also commonly found by researchers but at lower concentrations other classes mainly cationic were present in conjunction with anionic surfactants in some wastewaters which may provide an additional complexity to their treatment different wastewater sources also show significant variation between the surfactant compositions a significant difference between wastewater types was seen for bacs in hospital wastewater a result that can be explained by bacs common use as a disinfectant agent crucially concentrations also vary between wastewaters from similar sources as seen between kern et al s 2013 results and kreuzinger et al s 2007 medical wastewater results this means that ideal surfactant treatment needs to be suitable for a range of concentrations another trend in the literature is a focus on specific surfactant classes by researchers for example on the fate of qacs during sludge treatment li et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 this means there is a relative lack of characterisations of wastewaters that focus on the presence of different classes of surfactant while there is work with this aim most notably clara et al 2007 more up to date reviews that focus on wastewater characterisation are recommended to aid treatment development 2 2 biological treatments a particularly common treatment method especially for surfactants in domestic wastewater is for the surfactant to be treated in sewage wastewater treatment the effluent from this process is usually returned to rivers or other water sources whilst the sludge is used as a soil fertiliser the biodegradation of the surfactant occurs as the microorganisms utilise the surfactant either as an energy or nutrient source or by the co metabolisation of the surfactant in the catabolic pathways mungray and kumar 2008 mungray and kumar 2008 also stated that the biodegradation mechanism can be altered by factors such as the chemical structure of the surfactant and aerobic or anaerobic conditions aerobic degradation of surfactants has been investigated in numerous studies brunner et al 1988 prats et al 1997 gonzÃ¡lez et al 2007 and there a number of different species of bacteria capable of degrading a surfactant van ginkel 1996 the strain citrobacter braakii has been noted to degrade a wide variety of anionic surfactants aloui et al 2009 aerobic degradation of the surfactant could be accomplished in a number of ways from the use of activated sludge tanks to oxidation bonds to trickling filters it is worth mentioning however that the degradation method has a large impact on the removal efficiency of the surfactant numerous studies have shown that whilst activated sludge tanks can achieve removal efficiencies of between 98 9 and 99 9 for las a trickling filter has a much wider range of removal efficiencies of between 89 1 and 99 1 mungray and kumar 2008 whilst for alkylphenol ethoxylates the removal efficiency was more in the region of 90 gonzÃ¡lez et al 2007 it should be noted that these efficiencies can be reduced when physico chemical processes occur simultaneously with biological process such as in the case of the surfactant being sorbed into the sludge particles thus leading to it being withheld from aerobic degradation mantzavinos et al 2001 caution should be taken when comparing removal efficiencies between different treatment methods there is often a significant lack of consensus in the literature regarding quantification of a good removal efficiency whilst aerobic degradation of surfactants has seen significant use both historically and currently the same cannot be said for anaerobic degradation of surfactants indeed for a significant portion of history it was believed that it was not in fact possible to degrade surfactants anaerobically at all de wolf and feijtel 1998 since the 1990s however there have been papers showing anaerobic feasibility in these studies it has been shown that there are numerous different mechanisms by which anaerobic degradation can take place although it should be considered that most of the studies used las these mechanisms include sulphur limited conditions denger and cook 1999 thermophilic upflow in an anaerobic sludge blanket reactor mogensen and ahring 2002 inoculation from an aerobic environment angelidaki et al 2000 using an acidogenic reactor inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa almendariz et al 2001 after improving its bioavailability haggensen et al 2002 and in an upflow anaerobic sludge reactor under normal conditions sanz et al 2003 there have been numerous successful upflow anaerobic sludge reactors operated in india mungray and kumar 2008 it is worth noting the anaerobic degradation method has a significant impact on the removal efficiency of the surfactant depending on the method las removal under anaerobic conditions typically has a removal efficiency of between 40 and 85 haggensen et al 2002 mogensen and ahring 2002 there are other papers stating that whilst it is possible to degrade surfactants anaerobically it is extremely difficult to do feitkenhauer and meyer 2002 gavala and ahring 2002 it has also been shown that the surfactants disrupt certain digesters owing their high toxicity to some methogenic bacteria tanaka and ichikawa 1993 in the authors view biodegradation provides a reasonably efficient method of removing some surfactants within the existing infrastructural framework however there are also numerous limitations that make it unsuitable as a sole treatment method for surfactants in wastewater the main disadvantage is that it requires a low surfactant concentration this is because at levels above 1 000 000 Î¼g l the surfactant depolarises the bacterial cell wall and therefore destroys structure and function aloui et al 2009 the concentration of surfactant at which this occurs depends on the specific surfactant but values in the region of 50 000 Î¼g l for las degrading under aerobic conditions are quoted in literature mantzavinos et al 2001 abu hassan et al 2005 quaternary ammonium salts on the other hand are only degradable if fed into the wastewater treatment plant steadily and at low concentrations in the order of 15 000 Î¼g l gerike et al 1978 even below these concentrations it has been noted that a large portion of this surfactant can be sorbed into the sludge preventing it from being degraded abu hassan et al 2005 high surfactant concentrations have also been noted to lead to significant foaming problems in many reactors both aerobic and anaerobic due to the intense agitation and aeration required by the culture medium varley et al 2004 wang et al 2008 this issue means that biodegradation is not always a suitable method for being the sole treatment of surfactants a view that tanaka and ichikawa 1993 also expressed another issue are the concerns posed by the metabolites produced when some surfactants are degraded these metabolites can often resist further biodegradation resulting in them being released into water sources where they can mimic the forms of hormones petroviÄ et al 2003 preventing the complete mineralisation of the surfactant another issue is that whilst there are data that show certain surfactants can be biodegraded sufficiently even completely giolando et al 1995 there are also data suggesting that some surfactants have an extremely low biodegradability charles et al 1996 this variability poses feasibility issues a final consideration with regards to the biological methods currently available for surfactant treatment is that the method can be extremely costly as well as taking a significant amount of time Ã¶nder et al 2007 2 3 combined chemical and biological treatments the fact that biodegradation cannot treat wastewater where there is a high concentration of surfactant is a significant problem especially with industrial wastewater the textile industry in particular uses extremely high concentrations of surfactants arslan alaton et al 2007 which can cause significant issues with regards to treating the wastewater produced despite this it is often not considered economically feasible to remove biorecalcitrant surfactants from use lin et al 1999 one of the methods by which the problems elucidated above can be mitigated is by utilising a chemical pre treatment before the wastewater enters the treatment plant aloui et al 2009 the aim of chemical pre treatment of the biorecalcitrant compounds is to convert them to products which can be more easily biodegraded using biological processes and not to completely mineralise them adams and kuzhikannil 2000 these pre treatment methods usually fall into numerous categories of which one of the more commonly researched is the use of advanced oxidation processes aops aops typically involve the addition or creation of a highly oxidising species to degrade the organic matter amat et al 2004 and are usually either classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous depending on the state of the reactive phase or according to the method by which the hydroxyl radical is generated babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 this category consists of a wide range of processes of which the most utilised is fenton s reaction shown in fig 2 fenton s reaction utilises a mixture of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ferrous irons typically fe2 although fe3 has been utilised on occasion often from iron sulphate feso4 to decompose the hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen pignatello 1992 wang et al 2008 hydroxyl radicals then attack the surfactant babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 many studies focus on the ph where a value of roughly 3 is usually considered to be optimal kitis et al 1999 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 numerous other studies determined optimal operating conditions such as initial concentration of ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide but these are affected by the type of surfactant being degraded kitis et al 1999 wang et al 2008 the method also usually takes only around 40 50 min to achieve desired surfactant removal kitis et al 1999 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 despite these positive findings there have also been concerns raised over the turbidity and the removal of the dissolved iron after the process has been completed lin et al 1999 chemical coagulation has been proposed as a solution and studies show that this can reduce the amount of dissolved iron from 5000 Î¼g l to below 2000 Î¼g l lin et al 1999 this process is industrially scaled as seen in fig 2 due to the success of fenton s reaction other variations have been proposed such as electro fenton panizza et al 2013 although it is not widely used photo fenton on the other hand sees significantly more widespread use the reaction utilises irradiation caused by either uv or visible light to increase the degradation of the surfactant amat et al 2004 in a photocatalytic reaction the method has seen some success and has been shown to work for alcohol ethoxylates brand et al 2000 as well as seen the proposal for the use of chromium iii ions for use in the tannery industry amat et al 2004 photo fenton is sometimes considered to be more efficient than the conventional fenton reaction brand et al 2000 other photocatalytic aop pre treatment methods are common and have been the focus of numerous studies since the 1980s the main premise of the treatment is the utilisation of a catalyst to absorb the solar light both visible and uv amat et al 2004 one subset of catalysts used are solar sensitizers such as 2 4 6 triphenylpyrylium amat et al 2004 however aside from fenton s reagent hydrogen peroxide the other most popular catalyst is the heterogeneous titanium dioxide tio2 a semi conductor catalyst zhang et al 2001 that has been thoroughly investigated hidaka and zhao 1992 rao and dube 1996 horikoshi et al 2002 although the catalyst has had some success in degrading surfactants optimisation of the catalysts is often required this is because the use of solid supports for the catalyst can cause numerous issues such as reducing surface areas decreasing adsorption of the surfactant and imposing mass transfer limitations horikoshi et al 2002 a final aop that is also researched is ozonation which can be used either with hydrogen peroxide or uv to increase the biodegradation of the surfactant kitis et al 1999 venhuis and mehrvar 2004 however whilst the method has been shown to aid the degradation of many surfactants this is highly dependent on the oxidant dosage used kitis et al 1999 the process has also been known to inhibit bacterial growth beltran et al 2000 other aops are worth mentioning despite their uncommon use foam fractionation utilises bubbles created by a sparger to collect the surfactant letting the liquid drain away with the aid of gravity tharapiwattananon et al 1996 electrochemically generated coagulants utilise iron or aluminium ions that form flocs which float to the surface taking the surfactants with them ciorba et al 2002 foam fractionation has been noted to work better for cationic surfactants than anionic surfactants tharapiwattananon et al 1996 whilst the aops described above are commonly used in particular fenton s and the photocatalytic reactions it must also be considered that they will often only work for reasonably low concentrations of surfactants up to 100 000 Î¼g l abu hassan et al 2005 and that they are highly complex processes as well as being expensive treatments arena et al 2015 the latter point is in particular related to the ozonation and photocatalytic treatments which are sometimes held to be significantly more expensive than fenton s reaction lin et al 1999 it is therefore concluded with regards to aops that fenton s reaction is the most suitable method for industrial use further improvements made to the system configuration and quantum efficiency of photoreactors could reduce the costs associated with the use of titanium dioxide as a photocatalyst aops are considered highly versatile due to the fact that there are a number of different ways to produce hydroxyl radicals babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 they are however not the only chemical pre treatment method available of particular although not widespread interest is the use of wet air oxidation wao wao uses a high temperature highly pressurised gaseous oxygen source to oxidise the surfactant mantzavinos et al 1999 wao has been used to treat concentrations of las up to 1 600 000 Î¼g l abu hassan et al 2005 certain studies have also suggested that the use of a catalyst could result in milder wao operating conditions and shorter residence times mantzavinos et al 1999 abu hassan et al 2005 however whilst there have been successes in using this pre treatment method there have also been concerns raised that overall las biodegrades better without the treatment venhuis and mehrvar 2004 a final pre treatment method that is sometimes considered is the use of ultrasound or sonication this method has met with some success arena et al 2015 it is not widely used however as it relies on the surfactant concentration being far below that of the critical micellar concentration as the micelles protect the organic tails of the surfactant reducing the efficiency of the process vinodgopal et al 2001 in considering the use of a chemical pre treatment before biodegradation of a surfactant it should be noted that the process can be extremely complex and costly it is therefore our recommendation that the process is used minimally a view that is consistent with the literature adams and kuzhikannil 2000 it should also be noted that whilst anionic and non ionic surfactants are heavily studied the same cannot be said for cationic surfactants where there is a significant gap within the literature olmez hanci et al 2011 2 4 chemical treatments the characteristic foaming of surfactants in oxygenated water causes operational difficulties to biological and combined treatments dhouib et al 2003 in response to this purely chemical methods were discussed in the literature coagulation flocculation surfactant treatment was proposed by aboulhassan et al 2006 the use of traditional ferrous chlorides showed promisingly high levels of surfactant removal 99 for microelectronic wastewater at small scale however as with the other techniques discussed there is ambiguity in the literature more recently kaleta and elektorowicz 2013 found poor removal rates for anionic surfactants using the same coagulant they found certain enhancements such as activated carbon ac addition or polyelectrolyte based removal made the process more effective mohan 2014 proposed the use of so called naturalised coagulants such as pectin treatment times of 24 h showed good removal rates and utilised the secondary ac suggested by kaleta and elektorowicz 2013 ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 showed that ac powder had higher affinity for surfactants than both the standard zeolite and anaerobic sludge especially at high concentrations bindes and franco jr 2014 presented adsorption mechanisms for anionic surfactant the results imply that the technology is suitable for application ac is a well researched adsorbent for adsorption of surfactants wu and pendleton 2001 gonzÃ¡lez garcÃ­a et al 2004 saleh 2006 adsorption is a popular physico chemical method for surfactant removal including evidence of perfluoro carboxybetain removal by this method pabon and corpart 2002 other adsorbents including polymeric resins garcÃ­a delgado et al 1992 zeolite kawai and tsutsumi 1995 silica goloub et al 1996 and alumina pham et al 2015 have been studied as well however these traditional adsorbents could pose environmental issues in larger scale surfactant removal abd el lateef et al 2018 this is an issue that abd el lateef et al 2018 addressed recently by developing zero valent iron nanoparticles for surfactant adsorption this study considered both cationic and anionic surfactants a promising development as consideration of more than one type of surfactant class is often absent in the literature however further work is needed to corroborate the optimal adsorbent for large scale surfactant removal uptake of these chemical and physico chemical methods are hindered by the prevalence of biological treatments however the positive results shown by upstream and downstream chemical processes could positively impact development research into combining systems from the combined technologies with downstream processing such as ac technology is therefore recommended as with all research in this area more work into surfactants other than anionic is needed considering the general lack of interest in cationic surfactants 2 5 areas for improvement based on the technologies reviewed there are numerous treatment methods for surfactants available currently within the wastewater industry however there are still significant concerns with regards to their efficacy there are also few overarching literature reviews into current usage of the technologies and so an apparent lack of a clear consensus amongst the scientific community regarding the best techniques to be used this can be seen in the lack of comparable data between treatment methods improving the general availability of cost data for each of the processes as well as developing standardised tests for each of the treatment methods would greatly improve comparability of the treatment methods there is also a lack of information with regards to cationic surfactants as well as for other less widely used surfactants such as zwitterionic and non ionic something that has changed little over the last 10 years emerging classes such as perfluorinated and organosilicone surfactants should also be considered existing methods can partially deal with surfactant use but there appears to be significant scope for improvement in response to these challenges increasing attention is being seen in the literature for developing new techniques for surfactant removal the next section of this review therefore analyses proposals for novel surfactant removal techniques 3 novel treatment methods a potential strategy for future surfactant removal could be to promote novel techniques more suited to dealing with surfactants this section therefore reviews the cutting edge of surfactant removal techniques to provide an up to date position of these technologies 3 1 carbon nanotube cnt treatment ever since their discovery by iijima 1991 cnts have been researched for a wide variety of purposes from catalysis serp et al 2003 drug delivery liu et al 2009 and numerous others baughman et al 2002 in the wastewater treatment context cnts could be used as a nanomaterial for adsorption based treatment processes burakov et al 2018 as a replacement for traditional materials such as ac zeolite and kaolin gupta and saleh 2013 bankole et al 2017 as an example the adsorption mechanism for anionic and cationic surfactants onto cnts is shown in fig 3 the technology has received significant attention for use in wastewater treatment owing to the technology s large adsorption surface area and ability to adsorb a range of challenging materials that are of interest to the wastewater treatment industry qu et al 2013 lu and chiu 2006 gao et al 2016 younis et al 2014 one of these materials could be surfactants surfactants can be used to disperse cnts vaisman et al 2006 and to stabilise cnts in aqueous solutions vo and papavassilou 2017 both techniques rely on the adsorption mechanics of surfactant to cnts shown in fig 3 gao et al 2016 therefore proposed cnts for the removal of surfactants from water multi walled cnts mwcnts were used because of the relatively lower cost the results show high removal efficiencies for certain surfactants the paper provides a promising scientific foundation for the application of mwcnts to surfactant removal but there are issues the study was limited to simple surfactant solutions which is very unlikely in industrial wastewater based on the compositions found in table 2 to the authors knowledge gao et al s investigation is the only major investigation into this application of cnt technology this is despite the established precedent of surfactant adsorption using cnts and feasibility demonstrated by gao et al s 2016 work the remainder of this section therefore analyses the challenges associated with the technology that may explain this relative lack of research immediately cnt s high material cost compared to the other available adsorbent materials discussed in section 2 4 to is a hindrance to adoption in wastewater treatment ihsanullah et al 2016a this is an issue that will become less pertinent as cnt production continues to increase and drive the cost down in the authors opinion there are four technological issues that present a challenge for using cnts in wastewater treatment removal inconsistency cnt aggregation desorption and environmental impact 3 1 1 removal efficiency inconsistencies gao et al s 2016 results showed higher removal efficiencies for triton x 100 tx 100 surfactants compared to the other surfactants interestingly studies have even shown variation in the cnt removal performance of triton based surfactants bai et al 2010 found adsorption capacities of 330 6 737 3 mmol kg for a range of tx based surfactants they concluded that the hydrophilic chain length of the surfactant greatly impacted the adsorption capacity this is a conclusion that gao et al 2016 reached as well citing specific interaction mechanisms that are altered in different surfactants that other authors have investigated in depth elsewhere yang et al 2008 pan and xing 2008 the variable adsorption capacity has been mitigated in other water treatment cnt applications by surface modification and ph change ihsanullah et al 2016b ihsanullah et al 2016a presented detailed information about the wide range of cnt modifications shown in the literature specifically for heavy metal removal there are two conclusions that can be made from the review and associated work optimisation of cnt adsorption performance has been studied and there are numerous viable strategies to improve performance of raw cnts these include doping ji et al 2012 oxidisation tofighy and mohammadi 2011 and increasing initial concentration of target ion li et al 2005 the impact of this final change is shown in the improvement in lead removal between li et al 2002 and li et al 2005 this also raises an important consideration that the inconsistency is less of an issue than the effectiveness of removal similar work seen to modify cnts for heavy metal removal for the interactions of desired surfactants with the cnts could therefore solve this problem this development would allow for tailored surfactant removal if demonstrated in a more realistic system 3 1 2 aggregation another issue that gao et al 2016 found was the aggregation of cnts found at lower surfactant treatment concentrations this issue has been reported using cnts in aqueous solutions koh and cheng 2014 concluded that this aggregation mechanism was driven by electrostatic forces solutions to this problem would therefore need to be chemical based han et al 2015 proposed a bioinspired solution that limited aggregation effectively however both solutions were investigated for polymer disperse solutions where the aggregation could be controlled in the product assembly this is less feasible in the wastewater treatment context a more viable solution could be to incorporate cnts into membrane filtration this has been shown to be a viable application of cnt technology das et al 2014 das et al s application was for desalination and further work is needed before this suggestion could be applied to surfactant removal this is especially true considering the complex relationship surfactants have with filtration that is discussed in section 4 2 3 1 3 desorption one advantage of the adsorption approach for wastewater treatment is material recycling that offsets the cost of wastewater treatment this can be achieved from desorption processing downstream shang et al 2016 a key property of cnts in this application is therefore desorption capacity cnt desorption mechanisms have been studied in the literature although there appears to be a gap in the literature relating to surfactant desorption desorption for various molecules has been proven to be feasible for cnts by parameter alterations such as ph change engel and chefetz 2016 electric current paul et al 2015 temperature and shear vo and papavassiliou 2017 these studies did not concern surfactant adsorption however these studies do show that the desorption strategy is viable and that similar work to address surfactant would potentially yield promising results 3 1 4 environmental impact the increased production and use of cnts has led to concern about the impact on the environment and human health of cnts linÃ© et al 2017 especially in aquatic environments girardello et al 2015 used a hirudo medicinalis model to test the toxicity of mwcnts in living organisms their results show the potential for adverse effects of cnts on aquatic systems the effect of cnt on the environment is still a young research field and the effects are not properly understood linÃ© et al 2017 showed that there is a lack of consensus on the toxicity of the nanomaterial on plants in the literature for example that review called urgently for an increased research attention to this problem this is a view these authors share as it is difficult to recommend the development of cnts for surfactant treatment until that information is known the other issues 3 1 1 to 3 1 3 have been shown mitigatable in other cnt systems it is therefore the authors opinion that research effort to advance the technology will facilitate cnts as an effective future treatment technology provided environmental safety is demonstrated 3 2 magnetic removal techniques another potential future surfactant treatment is magnetic removal compared to cnt adsorption this technology simplifies downstream processing by using filters and presently could therefore be more cost effective this is a research area that has gained attention in multiple industries that yavuz et al 2009 reviewed for a general understanding ambashta and sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2010 reviewed magnetic technology in wastewater and water treatment in great depth and showed industrial adoption of the technology magnetic removal of contaminants such as arsenic mayo et al 2007 red textile dye iram et al 2010 radioactive pollutants ambashta and sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2010 and metallic contaminants oliveira et al 2004 have been demonstrated magnetic filtration is a feasible process and has been shown in numerous ways tsouris et al 2006 rossier et al 2012 ying et al 2000 an example of how this could work is shown in fig 4 borghi et al 2011 proposed the use of similar magnetic techniques shown in the figure for surfactant removal they compared commercially available iron oxides and found high cationic removal rates 90 at acceptable filtration times this technology could feasibly be used to adsorb surfactants alongside other contaminants a feature that cnts may not offer due to contamination concerns the development of magnetic surfactants the authors recommend brown et al 2015 for more information could also further improve the removal efficiency of the technology however the surfactant abatement during magnetic filtration found by borghi et al 2011 varied significantly for the other classes of surfactants investigated including anionic and non ionic surfactants this removal inconsistency between classes of surfactant may explain the lack of follow up work to this paper the lack of further investigation causes concern compared to cnts this technology could provide a quicker short term enhancement it is certainly a feasible suggestion where magnetic technologies are already used although no studies have shown the interaction of complex surfactant containing systems a potential reason could be the lack of agreement in the literature about the best adsorbent for use here research in the area has generally focused on using either powdered adsorbents such as iron oxide borghi et al 2011 zeolite based systems oliveira et al 2004 or even mwcnt held magnetic oxide particles qu et al 2008a this lack of clear consensus is challenging this aspect of the technology a clearer consensus needs to be found in the academic community before future work can tackle the concerns the authors would raise about this technology overall both technologies considered are promising but face challenges to replace existing treatment practices 4 novel uses of surfactants in the wastewater treatment process despite the many negative challenges their presence can cause in wastewater treatment surfactants could prove useful in improving existing wastewater treatment processes this field is gaining increasing attention in the literature there is therefore a need to consider recent developments to provide a balanced overview the aim is to provide the authors opinion on the progress of development by focussing on two key developments and their feasibility considering the potential risk of surfactant pollution the first development to be investigated is the potential for improving the performance of zeolites an increasingly important element of wastewater treatment 4 1 surfactant modified zeolites smzs natural zeolites have been used as low cost abundant and efficient adsorbent material for wastewater treatment lai et al 2003 wang and peng 2010 including ammonium ion removal nguyen and tanner 1998 heavy metal cations erdem et al 2004 jorfi et al 2017 and hydrocarbons torabian et al 2010 for a review on this technology wang and peng 2010 cover the subject in excellent depth zeolites have one major disadvantage as a wastewater adsorption material owing to their surface chemistry natural zeolites can only remove cationic pollutants reeve and fallowfield 2017 this is an issue as many pollutants of interest for example viruses and bacteria can only be absorbed by smzs schulze makuch et al 2002 surfactant modified zeolites smzs use a surfactant such as hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma to alter the surface chemistry of the zeolite naghash and nezamzadeh ejhieh 2015 this surface charge change allows adsorption of pollutants such as viruses and bacteria that raw zeolites cannot capture bowman 2003 discussed the potential applications of these hdtma smzs for removing contaminants from water recently this approach has been examined for use in larger scale water treatment naghash and nezamzadeh ejhieh 2015 focused on phosphate removal in industrial systems modification using surfactants increased phosphate removal by 90 at a phosphate concentration of 100 mmol l the hdtma smz performed optimally and stably across the parameters water ph contact time temperature and phosphate concentration interestingly this paper considers the performance of another surfactant hexadecylpyridinium hdp for zeolite modification this hdp smz performed worse than the hdtma smz although better than natural zeolite throughout the investigation these results justify both an increased interest in smzs recently and the general trend of the literature to investigate hdtma smzs hailu et al 2017 investigated the preparation of hdtma smzs for organic and inorganic pollutants acid blue dye and cr vi pollutants were effectively removed over a 24 h period a similar parameter investigation to naghash and nezamzadeh ejhieh 2015 revealed different optimal conditions to the high ph system in that paper hailu et al 2017 suggested that their chosen dye becomes anionic like the phosphate ion in acidic conditions this impact on performance is verified by the results in the naghash and nezamzadeh paper and raises an important issue in industrial reality there will be numerous competing pollutants these results raise the possibility of varying removal efficiency by smzs in application for example if both phosphate ions and chromate ions are in a solution selective adsorption would occur based on the different optimal conditions found in the paper so far the studies on hdtma smzs have focussed on proof of concept and have not attempted to improve the removal efficiency across the ph range a potential solution to this problem is to tailor smzs to their target application several other surfactant choices for smzs were discussed by apreutesei et al 2008 and have been shown feasible for specific removal purposes table 3 presents examples of research into different smzs while divergent the use of different smzs for specific targets is viable another capability issue with using smzs is the leaching of hdtma into the environment an issue that a recent review of zeolite technology in water remediation by reeve and fallowfield 2018 this review concluded that the desorption is a significant issue warranting further research reeve and fallowfield 2017 found that hdtma is non monotonically toxic towards the f rna bacteriophage ms2 this conclusion means that the highest toxicity of hdtma is not at its highest concentration for this bacteriophage this could be a problem as the stability of hdtma binding during aquatic application has been questioned at the low concentrations associated with surfactant desorption the desorption could prove environmentally harmful considering the toxicity and concentration relationship proposed by reeve and fallowfield those authors therefore investigated the impact of hdtma on soil health they found that for certain microflora there were no negative relationship was found however smzs adversely affected certain bacteria and future work to expand the scale of the work is recommended as such the studies considered on smzs are presently limited in scale and pose feasibility issues this means that as a technology this use of surfactants cannot make an immediate impact on wastewater treatment there are critical concerns that are beginning to be addressed but a renewed research and development effort is needed before large scale adoption can occur this work needs to demonstrate the performance of smzs on larger scale and the impact of their use will have on the environment in the author s opinion the positive results found for ion removal performance across the range of technologies and articles considered show that smzs have the potential to enhance the applicability of zeolite absorption and therefore improve wastewater treatment 4 2 micellar enhanced ultra filtration meuf another key process in the wastewater treatment process is the use of ultrafiltration uf to remove contaminants this process is often necessary to remove secondary solid waste pollutants caused by other treatments upstream gao et al 2018 recently there has been attention given to the potential of uf to recover key chemicals from the wastewater streams including nutrient recovery for algal bioreactor growth sandefur et al 2016 brackish water from textile wastewater erkanlÄ± et al 2017 and fluoride grzegorzek and majewska nowak 2017 however ultrafiltration often fails to reject compounds in the low molecular weight range such as phenol a particularly harmful wastewater constituent from the olive oil industry vÃ­ctor ortega et al 2017 the use of surfactants can mitigate this issue adding surfactants in concentrations above the critical micellar concentration cmc allows pollutants to be solubilised in the larger micelles and removed vÃ­ctor ortega et al 2017 this technology has gained significant attention in the literature recently because of the enhanced performance shown and mainly focuses on improving the performance of the technology huang et al 2017 grzegorzek and majewska nowak 2017 tortora et al 2018 however the major issue with the technology is the use of surfactants considering their impact on the environment it is difficult to justify their use in this context this is especially true considering the high concentrations needed for sds cmc there are potential mitigations to these concerns these approaches are summarised briefly in table 4 in the authors opinion the use of biosurfactants in meuf is the best strategy for reducing the impact of meuf however there are major challenges facing this technology most notably the lack of large scale production of a compound such as saponin used by samal et al 2017 as with the other treatments a combination of technologies could be the best solution if economically feasible expansion of the peuf technique could also be used to reduce the overall use of surfactants in this context a continuation of the recent interest in this area is therefore justified and recommended a focus should be placed on ensuring that the environmental impact of the technology is maintained as low as feasible 5 conclusions this review has considered the overall role of surfactants in wastewater treatment current biological combined and chemical methods were reviewed and the work to improve these techniques analysed state of the art removal technologies and applications of surfactant technologies in wastewater treatment were also discussed this review has revealed a dynamic and challenging field that could benefit from greater attention from the research community a lack of clear consensus regarding multiple aspects of treatment from best current method to materials used for novel methods to environmental impact was discovered this is largely due to the varying demands of different surfactants and a wealth of competing options several optimisation strategies have been researched that merit further investigation the novel techniques are promising but renewed research effort is needed to tackle concerns over environmental impacts and performance inconsistencies to aid this process further characterisation of multiple surfactant classes present in wastewater is required to enable tailored research into surfactant removal surfactants have also been shown to potentially play a key role in future contaminant removal efforts need to be made however to alleviate the potential environmental impacts of this approach continuous research effort is therefore recommended to enhance surfactant removal through optimisation of current methods and development of new methods discussed in the paper for new treatment plants funding the authors did not

19226,wastewater treatment has an important responsibility to react to changing consumer and industrial produced wastes that pose environmental challenges surfactants are one of these emerging contaminants they are of interest because of their increasingly ubiquitous domestic and industrial use and the difficulty their presence causes traditional treatment in response to this developing area this critical review considers research from a variety of technical backgrounds to provide an up to date overview of the impact of surfactants on the environment health and their removal this found major concerns about surfactants on the environment and on health being corroborated in the past five years current research into removal focuses on existing biological and chemical wastewater treatment optimisation despite improvements being found to traditional biological methods using chemical pre treatments there is a clear lack of consensus regarding the ideal strategy drawbacks and potential solutions for a range of these technologies including fenton reaction and aerobic degradation are discussed in this field the authors recommend an improved diversity in surfactants used for the research and addressing of significant knowledge gaps novel methods such as carbon nanotube cnt use are also discussed these methods while showing promising results will require continual research effort to resolve present issues such as variable performance and environmental concerns larger scale work is also needed to validate the initial work done potential uses of surfactants to optimise wastewater treatment such as surfactant modified zeolites smzs are also discussed this review finds that surfactant removal from wastewater is a promising and challenging field that warrants further investigation keywords surfactant wastewater fenton zeolite carbon nanotube 1 introduction treating emerging contaminants such as surfactants is one of the major challenges facing wastewater treatment surfactants are a particularly challenging member of this group this is because of the wide usage and range of surfactants and their negative impact both on the wastewater treatment process and more importantly on the environment surfactants surface active agents are amphiphilic molecules containing two distinct parts a hydrophilic group and a lipophilic group yuan et al 2014 and can be broadly defined as compounds that alter the energy relationships at interfaces often in terms of altering either the surface or interfacial tension glassman 1948 when present in low concentrations surfactants reduce the amount of interfacial free energy required to alter the interfacial or surface area and promote the expansion of one of the interfaces within the system rosen 1972 thereby improving the efficiency of numerous processes hoffmann 1990 as a result surfactants are widely used as wetting agents detergents and emulsifying agents glassman 1948 whilst other surfactants such as quaternary ammonium compounds qacs have also been noted to damage the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and so can be used as disinfectants mcdonnell and russell 1999 the basic structure of a surfactant is shown as fig 1 surfactants use is extremely common and has been growing since the 1980s from the 1 7 million tons used in 1984 and the 9 3 million tons used in 1995 aboulhassan et al 2006 to the 15 93 million tons used in 2014 and the expected 24 19 million tons used in 2022 market wired 2017 numerous industries utilise surfactants notably the textile industry but also in the pharmaceutical cosmetic mining oil recovery and paper industries patel et al 1999 aboulhassan et al 2006 although it should be noted that in 2014 homecare accounted for more than 40 of the global market market wired 2017 however whilst the global market for surfactants is growing there has also been increasing concern with regards to the harm surfactants cause to the environment especially from wastewater petroviÄ et al 2003 bolong et al 2009 rebello et al 2013 there are numerous papers published regarding the negative effect that surfactants had on the environment wildlife and humans hera 2002 hera 2013 venhuis and mehrvar 2004 report that linear alkylbenzene sulphonates las has been noted to amongst other effects damage fish gills alter swimming patterns in the larvae of blue mussels and cause excess mucus secretion as well as in the common goby reduce respiration numerous other studies and reviews have reported on the toxicity of a variety of different surfactants lewis and suprenant 1983 hall et al 1989 liwarska bizukojc et al 2005 azizullah et al 2012 lechuga et al 2016 as well as their effect on the environment cserhÃ¡ti et al 2002 mostly with a focus on a variety of aquatic organisms acute toxicity tests show that there is a large range in lc50 values from species to species and can range from 210 to 500 000 Î¼g l for non ionic surfactants 80 to 2 800 000 Î¼g l for cationic surfactants and 110 to 92 000 Î¼g l for anionic surfactants lewis and suprenant 1983 many of the surfactants tested were found to be toxic enough that they can be classified as very toxic toxic and harmful according to european union directive 67 548 eec lechuga et al 2016 other studies have noted that the surfactants can increase the amount of organic hydrocarbon compounds that are solubilised into water sources or be sorbed into soils and sediments where it could potentially become harmful to crops whilst also affecting the degradation of hydrophobic organic compounds ying 2006 further studies have noted that whilst there can be a high amount of removal of some surfactants more than 99 of las venhuis and mehrvar 2004 the remaining surfactant that ends up rivers and other water sources can bioaccumulate within certain species tolls et al 2000 resulting in biotransformation of tissues in addition to this it has been shown that exposure to some surfactants such as benzalkonium chlorides bacs can increase antibiotic resistance in microbes tandukar et al 2013 these concerns have in europe led to much tighter regulation in terms of surfactant biodegradability and their phosphorous compounds and phosphates content european commission 2000 in the usa any surfactants that bypass sewage treatment have to meet specific criteria epa 2016 despite the increase in regulation removal of surfactants from wastewater is still a growing concern especially considering the high toxicity and ubiquity of surfactants this is reflected by a steady increase in the number of publications considering both surfactants and wastewater treatment web of science 2017 however it is worth noting to the reader that many of these publications do not consider surfactants as their primary aim in general there is a lack of focus on surfactant challenges in the wastewater treatment process despite the overall increase in publications seen in the literature a holistic overview of surfactant s impact on the wastewater treatment process is often missing from the literature addressing the subject there is therefore a need for an up to date review of the topic this review will consider the breadth of current treatment methods used to remove commonly used anionic cationic and non ionic surfactants work in the literature to improve these techniques and novel removal attempts and strategies to utilise surfactants in wastewater treatment it is intended that this approach motivates further research into promising areas found in this review to tackle this important emerging issue in wastewater engineering 2 current treatment methods 2 1 surfactant types diversity and occurrence in wastewater part of the challenge facing current treatment methods is that there are a wide variety of surfactants with different characteristics within the surfactant market there are three main categories of surfactant anionic cationic and non ionic classification of a surfactant is normally done using the electrical charge on the hydrophilic part of the surfactant molecule anionic surfactants contain a negatively charged hydrophilic group such as a carboxyl or sulfonate whilst cationic surfactants contain a positively charged hydrophilic group such as quaternary ammonium or phosphonium glassman 1948 non ionic surfactants on the other hand have a non ionised hydrophilic group such as polymerized ethylene oxide glassman 1948 anionic surfactants are the most common and in 2009 accounted for around 60 of the world s surfactant production whilst non ionic surfactants accounted for 30 and amphoteric and cationic surfactants 10 aloui et al 2009 surfactants also have the potential to be zwitterionic with both negative and positive charges in the hydrophilic head gerola et al 2017 an example is cocamidopropyl betaine zhou et al 2017 this surfactant class is only just starting to attract attention in the literature from the treatment perspective for example merkova et al 2018 this review therefore focuses on the commonly researched surfactants outlined in table 1 other important emerging contaminants such as perfluorinated and organosilicone surfactants are also considered when possible although these are yet to attract significant attention in the literature from a removal perspective another potential challenge to removal methods could be the presence of multiple types of surfactant in wastewater a short literature review of surfactant occurrence and compositions in wastewaters highlights this issue and is presented in table 2 the review of wastewater samples found that the highest concentrations in wastewaters were for anionic surfactants cationic surfactants were also commonly found by researchers but at lower concentrations other classes mainly cationic were present in conjunction with anionic surfactants in some wastewaters which may provide an additional complexity to their treatment different wastewater sources also show significant variation between the surfactant compositions a significant difference between wastewater types was seen for bacs in hospital wastewater a result that can be explained by bacs common use as a disinfectant agent crucially concentrations also vary between wastewaters from similar sources as seen between kern et al s 2013 results and kreuzinger et al s 2007 medical wastewater results this means that ideal surfactant treatment needs to be suitable for a range of concentrations another trend in the literature is a focus on specific surfactant classes by researchers for example on the fate of qacs during sludge treatment li et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 this means there is a relative lack of characterisations of wastewaters that focus on the presence of different classes of surfactant while there is work with this aim most notably clara et al 2007 more up to date reviews that focus on wastewater characterisation are recommended to aid treatment development 2 2 biological treatments a particularly common treatment method especially for surfactants in domestic wastewater is for the surfactant to be treated in sewage wastewater treatment the effluent from this process is usually returned to rivers or other water sources whilst the sludge is used as a soil fertiliser the biodegradation of the surfactant occurs as the microorganisms utilise the surfactant either as an energy or nutrient source or by the co metabolisation of the surfactant in the catabolic pathways mungray and kumar 2008 mungray and kumar 2008 also stated that the biodegradation mechanism can be altered by factors such as the chemical structure of the surfactant and aerobic or anaerobic conditions aerobic degradation of surfactants has been investigated in numerous studies brunner et al 1988 prats et al 1997 gonzÃ¡lez et al 2007 and there a number of different species of bacteria capable of degrading a surfactant van ginkel 1996 the strain citrobacter braakii has been noted to degrade a wide variety of anionic surfactants aloui et al 2009 aerobic degradation of the surfactant could be accomplished in a number of ways from the use of activated sludge tanks to oxidation bonds to trickling filters it is worth mentioning however that the degradation method has a large impact on the removal efficiency of the surfactant numerous studies have shown that whilst activated sludge tanks can achieve removal efficiencies of between 98 9 and 99 9 for las a trickling filter has a much wider range of removal efficiencies of between 89 1 and 99 1 mungray and kumar 2008 whilst for alkylphenol ethoxylates the removal efficiency was more in the region of 90 gonzÃ¡lez et al 2007 it should be noted that these efficiencies can be reduced when physico chemical processes occur simultaneously with biological process such as in the case of the surfactant being sorbed into the sludge particles thus leading to it being withheld from aerobic degradation mantzavinos et al 2001 caution should be taken when comparing removal efficiencies between different treatment methods there is often a significant lack of consensus in the literature regarding quantification of a good removal efficiency whilst aerobic degradation of surfactants has seen significant use both historically and currently the same cannot be said for anaerobic degradation of surfactants indeed for a significant portion of history it was believed that it was not in fact possible to degrade surfactants anaerobically at all de wolf and feijtel 1998 since the 1990s however there have been papers showing anaerobic feasibility in these studies it has been shown that there are numerous different mechanisms by which anaerobic degradation can take place although it should be considered that most of the studies used las these mechanisms include sulphur limited conditions denger and cook 1999 thermophilic upflow in an anaerobic sludge blanket reactor mogensen and ahring 2002 inoculation from an aerobic environment angelidaki et al 2000 using an acidogenic reactor inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa almendariz et al 2001 after improving its bioavailability haggensen et al 2002 and in an upflow anaerobic sludge reactor under normal conditions sanz et al 2003 there have been numerous successful upflow anaerobic sludge reactors operated in india mungray and kumar 2008 it is worth noting the anaerobic degradation method has a significant impact on the removal efficiency of the surfactant depending on the method las removal under anaerobic conditions typically has a removal efficiency of between 40 and 85 haggensen et al 2002 mogensen and ahring 2002 there are other papers stating that whilst it is possible to degrade surfactants anaerobically it is extremely difficult to do feitkenhauer and meyer 2002 gavala and ahring 2002 it has also been shown that the surfactants disrupt certain digesters owing their high toxicity to some methogenic bacteria tanaka and ichikawa 1993 in the authors view biodegradation provides a reasonably efficient method of removing some surfactants within the existing infrastructural framework however there are also numerous limitations that make it unsuitable as a sole treatment method for surfactants in wastewater the main disadvantage is that it requires a low surfactant concentration this is because at levels above 1 000 000 Î¼g l the surfactant depolarises the bacterial cell wall and therefore destroys structure and function aloui et al 2009 the concentration of surfactant at which this occurs depends on the specific surfactant but values in the region of 50 000 Î¼g l for las degrading under aerobic conditions are quoted in literature mantzavinos et al 2001 abu hassan et al 2005 quaternary ammonium salts on the other hand are only degradable if fed into the wastewater treatment plant steadily and at low concentrations in the order of 15 000 Î¼g l gerike et al 1978 even below these concentrations it has been noted that a large portion of this surfactant can be sorbed into the sludge preventing it from being degraded abu hassan et al 2005 high surfactant concentrations have also been noted to lead to significant foaming problems in many reactors both aerobic and anaerobic due to the intense agitation and aeration required by the culture medium varley et al 2004 wang et al 2008 this issue means that biodegradation is not always a suitable method for being the sole treatment of surfactants a view that tanaka and ichikawa 1993 also expressed another issue are the concerns posed by the metabolites produced when some surfactants are degraded these metabolites can often resist further biodegradation resulting in them being released into water sources where they can mimic the forms of hormones petroviÄ et al 2003 preventing the complete mineralisation of the surfactant another issue is that whilst there are data that show certain surfactants can be biodegraded sufficiently even completely giolando et al 1995 there are also data suggesting that some surfactants have an extremely low biodegradability charles et al 1996 this variability poses feasibility issues a final consideration with regards to the biological methods currently available for surfactant treatment is that the method can be extremely costly as well as taking a significant amount of time Ã¶nder et al 2007 2 3 combined chemical and biological treatments the fact that biodegradation cannot treat wastewater where there is a high concentration of surfactant is a significant problem especially with industrial wastewater the textile industry in particular uses extremely high concentrations of surfactants arslan alaton et al 2007 which can cause significant issues with regards to treating the wastewater produced despite this it is often not considered economically feasible to remove biorecalcitrant surfactants from use lin et al 1999 one of the methods by which the problems elucidated above can be mitigated is by utilising a chemical pre treatment before the wastewater enters the treatment plant aloui et al 2009 the aim of chemical pre treatment of the biorecalcitrant compounds is to convert them to products which can be more easily biodegraded using biological processes and not to completely mineralise them adams and kuzhikannil 2000 these pre treatment methods usually fall into numerous categories of which one of the more commonly researched is the use of advanced oxidation processes aops aops typically involve the addition or creation of a highly oxidising species to degrade the organic matter amat et al 2004 and are usually either classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous depending on the state of the reactive phase or according to the method by which the hydroxyl radical is generated babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 this category consists of a wide range of processes of which the most utilised is fenton s reaction shown in fig 2 fenton s reaction utilises a mixture of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and ferrous irons typically fe2 although fe3 has been utilised on occasion often from iron sulphate feso4 to decompose the hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen pignatello 1992 wang et al 2008 hydroxyl radicals then attack the surfactant babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 many studies focus on the ph where a value of roughly 3 is usually considered to be optimal kitis et al 1999 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 numerous other studies determined optimal operating conditions such as initial concentration of ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide but these are affected by the type of surfactant being degraded kitis et al 1999 wang et al 2008 the method also usually takes only around 40 50 min to achieve desired surfactant removal kitis et al 1999 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 despite these positive findings there have also been concerns raised over the turbidity and the removal of the dissolved iron after the process has been completed lin et al 1999 chemical coagulation has been proposed as a solution and studies show that this can reduce the amount of dissolved iron from 5000 Î¼g l to below 2000 Î¼g l lin et al 1999 this process is industrially scaled as seen in fig 2 due to the success of fenton s reaction other variations have been proposed such as electro fenton panizza et al 2013 although it is not widely used photo fenton on the other hand sees significantly more widespread use the reaction utilises irradiation caused by either uv or visible light to increase the degradation of the surfactant amat et al 2004 in a photocatalytic reaction the method has seen some success and has been shown to work for alcohol ethoxylates brand et al 2000 as well as seen the proposal for the use of chromium iii ions for use in the tannery industry amat et al 2004 photo fenton is sometimes considered to be more efficient than the conventional fenton reaction brand et al 2000 other photocatalytic aop pre treatment methods are common and have been the focus of numerous studies since the 1980s the main premise of the treatment is the utilisation of a catalyst to absorb the solar light both visible and uv amat et al 2004 one subset of catalysts used are solar sensitizers such as 2 4 6 triphenylpyrylium amat et al 2004 however aside from fenton s reagent hydrogen peroxide the other most popular catalyst is the heterogeneous titanium dioxide tio2 a semi conductor catalyst zhang et al 2001 that has been thoroughly investigated hidaka and zhao 1992 rao and dube 1996 horikoshi et al 2002 although the catalyst has had some success in degrading surfactants optimisation of the catalysts is often required this is because the use of solid supports for the catalyst can cause numerous issues such as reducing surface areas decreasing adsorption of the surfactant and imposing mass transfer limitations horikoshi et al 2002 a final aop that is also researched is ozonation which can be used either with hydrogen peroxide or uv to increase the biodegradation of the surfactant kitis et al 1999 venhuis and mehrvar 2004 however whilst the method has been shown to aid the degradation of many surfactants this is highly dependent on the oxidant dosage used kitis et al 1999 the process has also been known to inhibit bacterial growth beltran et al 2000 other aops are worth mentioning despite their uncommon use foam fractionation utilises bubbles created by a sparger to collect the surfactant letting the liquid drain away with the aid of gravity tharapiwattananon et al 1996 electrochemically generated coagulants utilise iron or aluminium ions that form flocs which float to the surface taking the surfactants with them ciorba et al 2002 foam fractionation has been noted to work better for cationic surfactants than anionic surfactants tharapiwattananon et al 1996 whilst the aops described above are commonly used in particular fenton s and the photocatalytic reactions it must also be considered that they will often only work for reasonably low concentrations of surfactants up to 100 000 Î¼g l abu hassan et al 2005 and that they are highly complex processes as well as being expensive treatments arena et al 2015 the latter point is in particular related to the ozonation and photocatalytic treatments which are sometimes held to be significantly more expensive than fenton s reaction lin et al 1999 it is therefore concluded with regards to aops that fenton s reaction is the most suitable method for industrial use further improvements made to the system configuration and quantum efficiency of photoreactors could reduce the costs associated with the use of titanium dioxide as a photocatalyst aops are considered highly versatile due to the fact that there are a number of different ways to produce hydroxyl radicals babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 they are however not the only chemical pre treatment method available of particular although not widespread interest is the use of wet air oxidation wao wao uses a high temperature highly pressurised gaseous oxygen source to oxidise the surfactant mantzavinos et al 1999 wao has been used to treat concentrations of las up to 1 600 000 Î¼g l abu hassan et al 2005 certain studies have also suggested that the use of a catalyst could result in milder wao operating conditions and shorter residence times mantzavinos et al 1999 abu hassan et al 2005 however whilst there have been successes in using this pre treatment method there have also been concerns raised that overall las biodegrades better without the treatment venhuis and mehrvar 2004 a final pre treatment method that is sometimes considered is the use of ultrasound or sonication this method has met with some success arena et al 2015 it is not widely used however as it relies on the surfactant concentration being far below that of the critical micellar concentration as the micelles protect the organic tails of the surfactant reducing the efficiency of the process vinodgopal et al 2001 in considering the use of a chemical pre treatment before biodegradation of a surfactant it should be noted that the process can be extremely complex and costly it is therefore our recommendation that the process is used minimally a view that is consistent with the literature adams and kuzhikannil 2000 it should also be noted that whilst anionic and non ionic surfactants are heavily studied the same cannot be said for cationic surfactants where there is a significant gap within the literature olmez hanci et al 2011 2 4 chemical treatments the characteristic foaming of surfactants in oxygenated water causes operational difficulties to biological and combined treatments dhouib et al 2003 in response to this purely chemical methods were discussed in the literature coagulation flocculation surfactant treatment was proposed by aboulhassan et al 2006 the use of traditional ferrous chlorides showed promisingly high levels of surfactant removal 99 for microelectronic wastewater at small scale however as with the other techniques discussed there is ambiguity in the literature more recently kaleta and elektorowicz 2013 found poor removal rates for anionic surfactants using the same coagulant they found certain enhancements such as activated carbon ac addition or polyelectrolyte based removal made the process more effective mohan 2014 proposed the use of so called naturalised coagulants such as pectin treatment times of 24 h showed good removal rates and utilised the secondary ac suggested by kaleta and elektorowicz 2013 ochoa herrera and sierra alvarez 2008 showed that ac powder had higher affinity for surfactants than both the standard zeolite and anaerobic sludge especially at high concentrations bindes and franco jr 2014 presented adsorption mechanisms for anionic surfactant the results imply that the technology is suitable for application ac is a well researched adsorbent for adsorption of surfactants wu and pendleton 2001 gonzÃ¡lez garcÃ­a et al 2004 saleh 2006 adsorption is a popular physico chemical method for surfactant removal including evidence of perfluoro carboxybetain removal by this method pabon and corpart 2002 other adsorbents including polymeric resins garcÃ­a delgado et al 1992 zeolite kawai and tsutsumi 1995 silica goloub et al 1996 and alumina pham et al 2015 have been studied as well however these traditional adsorbents could pose environmental issues in larger scale surfactant removal abd el lateef et al 2018 this is an issue that abd el lateef et al 2018 addressed recently by developing zero valent iron nanoparticles for surfactant adsorption this study considered both cationic and anionic surfactants a promising development as consideration of more than one type of surfactant class is often absent in the literature however further work is needed to corroborate the optimal adsorbent for large scale surfactant removal uptake of these chemical and physico chemical methods are hindered by the prevalence of biological treatments however the positive results shown by upstream and downstream chemical processes could positively impact development research into combining systems from the combined technologies with downstream processing such as ac technology is therefore recommended as with all research in this area more work into surfactants other than anionic is needed considering the general lack of interest in cationic surfactants 2 5 areas for improvement based on the technologies reviewed there are numerous treatment methods for surfactants available currently within the wastewater industry however there are still significant concerns with regards to their efficacy there are also few overarching literature reviews into current usage of the technologies and so an apparent lack of a clear consensus amongst the scientific community regarding the best techniques to be used this can be seen in the lack of comparable data between treatment methods improving the general availability of cost data for each of the processes as well as developing standardised tests for each of the treatment methods would greatly improve comparability of the treatment methods there is also a lack of information with regards to cationic surfactants as well as for other less widely used surfactants such as zwitterionic and non ionic something that has changed little over the last 10 years emerging classes such as perfluorinated and organosilicone surfactants should also be considered existing methods can partially deal with surfactant use but there appears to be significant scope for improvement in response to these challenges increasing attention is being seen in the literature for developing new techniques for surfactant removal the next section of this review therefore analyses proposals for novel surfactant removal techniques 3 novel treatment methods a potential strategy for future surfactant removal could be to promote novel techniques more suited to dealing with surfactants this section therefore reviews the cutting edge of surfactant removal techniques to provide an up to date position of these technologies 3 1 carbon nanotube cnt treatment ever since their discovery by iijima 1991 cnts have been researched for a wide variety of purposes from catalysis serp et al 2003 drug delivery liu et al 2009 and numerous others baughman et al 2002 in the wastewater treatment context cnts could be used as a nanomaterial for adsorption based treatment processes burakov et al 2018 as a replacement for traditional materials such as ac zeolite and kaolin gupta and saleh 2013 bankole et al 2017 as an example the adsorption mechanism for anionic and cationic surfactants onto cnts is shown in fig 3 the technology has received significant attention for use in wastewater treatment owing to the technology s large adsorption surface area and ability to adsorb a range of challenging materials that are of interest to the wastewater treatment industry qu et al 2013 lu and chiu 2006 gao et al 2016 younis et al 2014 one of these materials could be surfactants surfactants can be used to disperse cnts vaisman et al 2006 and to stabilise cnts in aqueous solutions vo and papavassilou 2017 both techniques rely on the adsorption mechanics of surfactant to cnts shown in fig 3 gao et al 2016 therefore proposed cnts for the removal of surfactants from water multi walled cnts mwcnts were used because of the relatively lower cost the results show high removal efficiencies for certain surfactants the paper provides a promising scientific foundation for the application of mwcnts to surfactant removal but there are issues the study was limited to simple surfactant solutions which is very unlikely in industrial wastewater based on the compositions found in table 2 to the authors knowledge gao et al s investigation is the only major investigation into this application of cnt technology this is despite the established precedent of surfactant adsorption using cnts and feasibility demonstrated by gao et al s 2016 work the remainder of this section therefore analyses the challenges associated with the technology that may explain this relative lack of research immediately cnt s high material cost compared to the other available adsorbent materials discussed in section 2 4 to is a hindrance to adoption in wastewater treatment ihsanullah et al 2016a this is an issue that will become less pertinent as cnt production continues to increase and drive the cost down in the authors opinion there are four technological issues that present a challenge for using cnts in wastewater treatment removal inconsistency cnt aggregation desorption and environmental impact 3 1 1 removal efficiency inconsistencies gao et al s 2016 results showed higher removal efficiencies for triton x 100 tx 100 surfactants compared to the other surfactants interestingly studies have even shown variation in the cnt removal performance of triton based surfactants bai et al 2010 found adsorption capacities of 330 6 737 3 mmol kg for a range of tx based surfactants they concluded that the hydrophilic chain length of the surfactant greatly impacted the adsorption capacity this is a conclusion that gao et al 2016 reached as well citing specific interaction mechanisms that are altered in different surfactants that other authors have investigated in depth elsewhere yang et al 2008 pan and xing 2008 the variable adsorption capacity has been mitigated in other water treatment cnt applications by surface modification and ph change ihsanullah et al 2016b ihsanullah et al 2016a presented detailed information about the wide range of cnt modifications shown in the literature specifically for heavy metal removal there are two conclusions that can be made from the review and associated work optimisation of cnt adsorption performance has been studied and there are numerous viable strategies to improve performance of raw cnts these include doping ji et al 2012 oxidisation tofighy and mohammadi 2011 and increasing initial concentration of target ion li et al 2005 the impact of this final change is shown in the improvement in lead removal between li et al 2002 and li et al 2005 this also raises an important consideration that the inconsistency is less of an issue than the effectiveness of removal similar work seen to modify cnts for heavy metal removal for the interactions of desired surfactants with the cnts could therefore solve this problem this development would allow for tailored surfactant removal if demonstrated in a more realistic system 3 1 2 aggregation another issue that gao et al 2016 found was the aggregation of cnts found at lower surfactant treatment concentrations this issue has been reported using cnts in aqueous solutions koh and cheng 2014 concluded that this aggregation mechanism was driven by electrostatic forces solutions to this problem would therefore need to be chemical based han et al 2015 proposed a bioinspired solution that limited aggregation effectively however both solutions were investigated for polymer disperse solutions where the aggregation could be controlled in the product assembly this is less feasible in the wastewater treatment context a more viable solution could be to incorporate cnts into membrane filtration this has been shown to be a viable application of cnt technology das et al 2014 das et al s application was for desalination and further work is needed before this suggestion could be applied to surfactant removal this is especially true considering the complex relationship surfactants have with filtration that is discussed in section 4 2 3 1 3 desorption one advantage of the adsorption approach for wastewater treatment is material recycling that offsets the cost of wastewater treatment this can be achieved from desorption processing downstream shang et al 2016 a key property of cnts in this application is therefore desorption capacity cnt desorption mechanisms have been studied in the literature although there appears to be a gap in the literature relating to surfactant desorption desorption for various molecules has been proven to be feasible for cnts by parameter alterations such as ph change engel and chefetz 2016 electric current paul et al 2015 temperature and shear vo and papavassiliou 2017 these studies did not concern surfactant adsorption however these studies do show that the desorption strategy is viable and that similar work to address surfactant would potentially yield promising results 3 1 4 environmental impact the increased production and use of cnts has led to concern about the impact on the environment and human health of cnts linÃ© et al 2017 especially in aquatic environments girardello et al 2015 used a hirudo medicinalis model to test the toxicity of mwcnts in living organisms their results show the potential for adverse effects of cnts on aquatic systems the effect of cnt on the environment is still a young research field and the effects are not properly understood linÃ© et al 2017 showed that there is a lack of consensus on the toxicity of the nanomaterial on plants in the literature for example that review called urgently for an increased research attention to this problem this is a view these authors share as it is difficult to recommend the development of cnts for surfactant treatment until that information is known the other issues 3 1 1 to 3 1 3 have been shown mitigatable in other cnt systems it is therefore the authors opinion that research effort to advance the technology will facilitate cnts as an effective future treatment technology provided environmental safety is demonstrated 3 2 magnetic removal techniques another potential future surfactant treatment is magnetic removal compared to cnt adsorption this technology simplifies downstream processing by using filters and presently could therefore be more cost effective this is a research area that has gained attention in multiple industries that yavuz et al 2009 reviewed for a general understanding ambashta and sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2010 reviewed magnetic technology in wastewater and water treatment in great depth and showed industrial adoption of the technology magnetic removal of contaminants such as arsenic mayo et al 2007 red textile dye iram et al 2010 radioactive pollutants ambashta and sillanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2010 and metallic contaminants oliveira et al 2004 have been demonstrated magnetic filtration is a feasible process and has been shown in numerous ways tsouris et al 2006 rossier et al 2012 ying et al 2000 an example of how this could work is shown in fig 4 borghi et al 2011 proposed the use of similar magnetic techniques shown in the figure for surfactant removal they compared commercially available iron oxides and found high cationic removal rates 90 at acceptable filtration times this technology could feasibly be used to adsorb surfactants alongside other contaminants a feature that cnts may not offer due to contamination concerns the development of magnetic surfactants the authors recommend brown et al 2015 for more information could also further improve the removal efficiency of the technology however the surfactant abatement during magnetic filtration found by borghi et al 2011 varied significantly for the other classes of surfactants investigated including anionic and non ionic surfactants this removal inconsistency between classes of surfactant may explain the lack of follow up work to this paper the lack of further investigation causes concern compared to cnts this technology could provide a quicker short term enhancement it is certainly a feasible suggestion where magnetic technologies are already used although no studies have shown the interaction of complex surfactant containing systems a potential reason could be the lack of agreement in the literature about the best adsorbent for use here research in the area has generally focused on using either powdered adsorbents such as iron oxide borghi et al 2011 zeolite based systems oliveira et al 2004 or even mwcnt held magnetic oxide particles qu et al 2008a this lack of clear consensus is challenging this aspect of the technology a clearer consensus needs to be found in the academic community before future work can tackle the concerns the authors would raise about this technology overall both technologies considered are promising but face challenges to replace existing treatment practices 4 novel uses of surfactants in the wastewater treatment process despite the many negative challenges their presence can cause in wastewater treatment surfactants could prove useful in improving existing wastewater treatment processes this field is gaining increasing attention in the literature there is therefore a need to consider recent developments to provide a balanced overview the aim is to provide the authors opinion on the progress of development by focussing on two key developments and their feasibility considering the potential risk of surfactant pollution the first development to be investigated is the potential for improving the performance of zeolites an increasingly important element of wastewater treatment 4 1 surfactant modified zeolites smzs natural zeolites have been used as low cost abundant and efficient adsorbent material for wastewater treatment lai et al 2003 wang and peng 2010 including ammonium ion removal nguyen and tanner 1998 heavy metal cations erdem et al 2004 jorfi et al 2017 and hydrocarbons torabian et al 2010 for a review on this technology wang and peng 2010 cover the subject in excellent depth zeolites have one major disadvantage as a wastewater adsorption material owing to their surface chemistry natural zeolites can only remove cationic pollutants reeve and fallowfield 2017 this is an issue as many pollutants of interest for example viruses and bacteria can only be absorbed by smzs schulze makuch et al 2002 surfactant modified zeolites smzs use a surfactant such as hexadecyltrimethylammonium hdtma to alter the surface chemistry of the zeolite naghash and nezamzadeh ejhieh 2015 this surface charge change allows adsorption of pollutants such as viruses and bacteria that raw zeolites cannot capture bowman 2003 discussed the potential applications of these hdtma smzs for removing contaminants from water recently this approach has been examined for use in larger scale water treatment naghash and nezamzadeh ejhieh 2015 focused on phosphate removal in industrial systems modification using surfactants increased phosphate removal by 90 at a phosphate concentration of 100 mmol l the hdtma smz performed optimally and stably across the parameters water ph contact time temperature and phosphate concentration interestingly this paper considers the performance of another surfactant hexadecylpyridinium hdp for zeolite modification this hdp smz performed worse than the hdtma smz although better than natural zeolite throughout the investigation these results justify both an increased interest in smzs recently and the general trend of the literature to investigate hdtma smzs hailu et al 2017 investigated the preparation of hdtma smzs for organic and inorganic pollutants acid blue dye and cr vi pollutants were effectively removed over a 24 h period a similar parameter investigation to naghash and nezamzadeh ejhieh 2015 revealed different optimal conditions to the high ph system in that paper hailu et al 2017 suggested that their chosen dye becomes anionic like the phosphate ion in acidic conditions this impact on performance is verified by the results in the naghash and nezamzadeh paper and raises an important issue in industrial reality there will be numerous competing pollutants these results raise the possibility of varying removal efficiency by smzs in application for example if both phosphate ions and chromate ions are in a solution selective adsorption would occur based on the different optimal conditions found in the paper so far the studies on hdtma smzs have focussed on proof of concept and have not attempted to improve the removal efficiency across the ph range a potential solution to this problem is to tailor smzs to their target application several other surfactant choices for smzs were discussed by apreutesei et al 2008 and have been shown feasible for specific removal purposes table 3 presents examples of research into different smzs while divergent the use of different smzs for specific targets is viable another capability issue with using smzs is the leaching of hdtma into the environment an issue that a recent review of zeolite technology in water remediation by reeve and fallowfield 2018 this review concluded that the desorption is a significant issue warranting further research reeve and fallowfield 2017 found that hdtma is non monotonically toxic towards the f rna bacteriophage ms2 this conclusion means that the highest toxicity of hdtma is not at its highest concentration for this bacteriophage this could be a problem as the stability of hdtma binding during aquatic application has been questioned at the low concentrations associated with surfactant desorption the desorption could prove environmentally harmful considering the toxicity and concentration relationship proposed by reeve and fallowfield those authors therefore investigated the impact of hdtma on soil health they found that for certain microflora there were no negative relationship was found however smzs adversely affected certain bacteria and future work to expand the scale of the work is recommended as such the studies considered on smzs are presently limited in scale and pose feasibility issues this means that as a technology this use of surfactants cannot make an immediate impact on wastewater treatment there are critical concerns that are beginning to be addressed but a renewed research and development effort is needed before large scale adoption can occur this work needs to demonstrate the performance of smzs on larger scale and the impact of their use will have on the environment in the author s opinion the positive results found for ion removal performance across the range of technologies and articles considered show that smzs have the potential to enhance the applicability of zeolite absorption and therefore improve wastewater treatment 4 2 micellar enhanced ultra filtration meuf another key process in the wastewater treatment process is the use of ultrafiltration uf to remove contaminants this process is often necessary to remove secondary solid waste pollutants caused by other treatments upstream gao et al 2018 recently there has been attention given to the potential of uf to recover key chemicals from the wastewater streams including nutrient recovery for algal bioreactor growth sandefur et al 2016 brackish water from textile wastewater erkanlÄ± et al 2017 and fluoride grzegorzek and majewska nowak 2017 however ultrafiltration often fails to reject compounds in the low molecular weight range such as phenol a particularly harmful wastewater constituent from the olive oil industry vÃ­ctor ortega et al 2017 the use of surfactants can mitigate this issue adding surfactants in concentrations above the critical micellar concentration cmc allows pollutants to be solubilised in the larger micelles and removed vÃ­ctor ortega et al 2017 this technology has gained significant attention in the literature recently because of the enhanced performance shown and mainly focuses on improving the performance of the technology huang et al 2017 grzegorzek and majewska nowak 2017 tortora et al 2018 however the major issue with the technology is the use of surfactants considering their impact on the environment it is difficult to justify their use in this context this is especially true considering the high concentrations needed for sds cmc there are potential mitigations to these concerns these approaches are summarised briefly in table 4 in the authors opinion the use of biosurfactants in meuf is the best strategy for reducing the impact of meuf however there are major challenges facing this technology most notably the lack of large scale production of a compound such as saponin used by samal et al 2017 as with the other treatments a combination of technologies could be the best solution if economically feasible expansion of the peuf technique could also be used to reduce the overall use of surfactants in this context a continuation of the recent interest in this area is therefore justified and recommended a focus should be placed on ensuring that the environmental impact of the technology is maintained as low as feasible 5 conclusions this review has considered the overall role of surfactants in wastewater treatment current biological combined and chemical methods were reviewed and the work to improve these techniques analysed state of the art removal technologies and applications of surfactant technologies in wastewater treatment were also discussed this review has revealed a dynamic and challenging field that could benefit from greater attention from the research community a lack of clear consensus regarding multiple aspects of treatment from best current method to materials used for novel methods to environmental impact was discovered this is largely due to the varying demands of different surfactants and a wealth of competing options several optimisation strategies have been researched that merit further investigation the novel techniques are promising but renewed research effort is needed to tackle concerns over environmental impacts and performance inconsistencies to aid this process further characterisation of multiple surfactant classes present in wastewater is required to enable tailored research into surfactant removal surfactants have also

19227,water disinfection involves the use of different types of disinfectants which are oxidizing agents that react with natural organic matter nom to form disinfection by products dbps the united states environmental protection agency usepa has established threshold limits on some dbps which are known as regulated dbps r dbps the human health risks associated with r dbps in drinking water distribution systems dwdss and application of stricter regulations have led water utilities to switch from conventional disinfectant i e chlorination to alternative disinfectants however the use of alternative disinfectants causes formation of a new suit of dbps known as unregulated dbps ur dbps which in many cases can be more toxic there is a growing concern of ur dbps formation in drinking water this review prioritizes some commonly occurring ur dbp groups and species in dwdss based on their concentration level reported frequency and toxicity using an indexing method there are nine ur dbps group and 36 species that have been identified based on recent published peer reviewed articles haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetaldehydes hals are identified as important ur dbp groups dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloroacetaldehye tcal are identified as critical ur dbps species the outcomes of this review can help water regulators to identify the most critical ur dbps species in the context of drinking water safety and provide them with useful information to develop guidelines or threshold limits for ur dbps the outcomes can also help water utilities in selecting water treatment processes for the mitigation of human health risk posed by ur dbps through drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords unregulated disinfection by products drinking water distribution systems prioritization concentration level toxicity reported frequency 1 introduction disinfection is the most common process for inactivating microorganisms water disinfection is an important step for drinking water treatment and it has been in practice for over one hundred years cheung 2017 the disinfectants used in water treatment processes are various oxidants including chlorine chlorine dioxide chloramine and ozone they react with natural organic matter nom in drinking water distribution systems dwdss to form disinfection by products dbps among all disinfectants chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant worldwide richardson and postigo 2015 zwiener 2006 guilherme and rodriguez 2014 richardson et al 2007 dbps have been in the spotlight since 1974 hrudey et al 2015 and since then plenty of research has been conducted to increase the understanding of dbps in terms of their formation processes and exposure levels in dwdss and the associated human health effects guilherme and rodriguez 2015 richardson et al 2007 li and mitch 2018 to date around 700 dbps have been identified in drinking waters thun et al 2017 among all the reported dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloaceticacids haas are the most extensively investigated groups in epidemiological studies hebert et al 2010 sadiq and rodriguez 2004 dbps present a potential threat to human health as many of them are considered carcinogenic mutagenic and reproductive toxicants hrudey 2008 cheung 2017 freeman et al 2017 ahmad and husain 2015 dbps can enter the human body and impair human health by multiple exposure routes for example oral intake of drinking water that contains high concentration dbps inhalation of dbps in the air when water is rigorously agitated e g taking a shower or swimming and adsorption through skin contact cehtp 2015 villanueva et al 2015 xu and weisel 2003 considering the potential adverse human health effects richardson et al 2002 the united states environmental protection agency usepa has prescribed threshold limits on some dbps in dwdss the dbps that have the imposed threshold limits defined by the usepa are known as regulated dbps r dbps benson et al 2017 the usepa initiated a stage 1 dbp rule in 1998 to ensure public health protection by reducing the exposure to dbps usepa 2010 the stage 1 dbp rule considers dbp sampling based on the maximum residence time which does not necessarily represent the highest dbp concentration levels especially considering the dbps that are likely to degrade in dwdss the stage 1 rule was upgraded to a stage 2 rule in january 2006 which underlines increased protection against potential human health effects by establishing more strict compliance monitoring requirements for the r dbps usepa 2010 in stage 2 rule the maximum contaminant level mcl is measured by considering locational running annual averages instead of the overall annual average the mcl is the legal allowable threshold limit of a dbp s concentration in dwdss under the safe drinking water act sdwa hence it should not be exceeded at each monitoring site in addition the stage 2 rule enforces dwdss operators to monitor operation by applying operational evaluation levels oels for calculating oel the annual monitoring results are first divided into four quarters and then an average of the monitoring results in two previous quarters is taken and combined with two times the current quarter monitoring results to get the final value this helps to predict the likelihood of exceeding the mcl for the next quarter and to make operational changes accordingly usepa 2008 pennsylvania 2013 table 1 shows the list of r dbp groups along with their mcls and possible human health effects usepa 2017a the formation of dbps and their concentrations in drinking water depend on many factors including disinfectant types source water characteristics operational conditions water temperature and water residence time in dwdss krasner 2009 these factors interact with each other in real systems making dbp risk assessment a challenging task the dbp formation and behavior in dwdss can be predicted or calculated using predictive or mechanistic models these models help water utility managers and regulators in decision making of applying controls to reduce exposure and establishing threshold limits sadiq and rodriguez 2004 2011 mechanistic models generally represent the parameters as a function of time the development of a mechanistic model is often complex as it involves the chemical reactions between nom and disinfectants hence predictive models are generally preferred over mechanistic models sadiq and rodriguez 2011 loucks and van beek 2017 more than a hundred models have been developed for predicting r dbps to control their human health exposure by applying optimum disinfectant dose and monitoring r dbp formation these models are not developed to predict all r dbps together however they are separate models developed for different r dbps groups and species the r dbps groups for which predictive models have been developed include thms haas bromate and chlorite in addition separate models have been developed for different species of thms and haas powell et al 2005 fischer 2015 islam et al 2016 sadiq and rodriguez 2011 ahmad and husain 2015 leavey roback et al 2016 sohn et al 2004 ged et al 2015 using chlorine as a disinfectant also known as chlorination has several advantages including it is effective against most microorganisms can oxidize iron and manganese to avoid unpleasant tastes in water and is likely to maintain residual chlorine content in dwdss washington state 2004 in general disinfection is applied at water treatment plants but for large dwdss adding disinfectants in the dwds might be needed adding disinfectants in dwds is also known as a booster chlorination station booster chlorination station maintains the residual levels of disinfectants for pathogen control however this process can increase the formation of dbps goslan emma 2017 the formation of dbps particularly r dbps is mainly associated with chlorine to avoid the formation of chorine derived dbps several alternative disinfectants e g chloramines ozone and chlorine dioxide have been considered for drinking water treatment chloramine has been increasingly used for secondary disinfection the main advantage of using chloramine instead of chlorine is that chloramine can reduce the formation of r dbps and other chemical compounds which cause undesirable taste and odor in drinking waters in addition chloramine can control biofilm growth as it can penetrate biofilms more effectively compared to chlorine liu et al 2016 however chloramine can favor the formation of n nitrosamines nas le roux et al 2010 the use of chloramine for drinking water disinfection is not allowed in some european countries such as france italy and germany the united kingdom and spain are the few european countries that allow the use of chloramines for residual disinfection amy 2007 ozonation is another effective drinking water disinfection approach but this process is prone to form r dbps such as bromate in drinking waters washington state 2004 the use of these alternative disinfectants in dwdss have reduced the formation of r dbps as compared to conventional disinfection e g chlorination li et al 2017 krasner 2009 however these alternative disinfectants have raised new concerns by introducing a new suite of dbps known as emerging or un regulated dbps ur dbps legay et al 2015 krasner 2009 hence in recent years the scientific community has focused more on ur dbps to understand their formation mechanisms concentration levels and associated adverse human health effects richardson and postigo 2015 leavey roback et al 2016 chen and westerhoff 2010 guilherme and rodriguez 2015 krasner 2009 many comprehensive studies especially related to the spatial and temporal investigations of ur dbp groups and species in dwdss have been conducted marcoux et al 2017 wang et al 2015a b guilherme and rodriguez 2014 serrano et al 2015 wei et al 2010 liu 2014 in addition analytical advancement enables the analysis of ur dbps even at trace levels in drinking water for example some ur dbps like nas occur at very low concentrations ng l the use of novel sampling extraction and analytical methods such as liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry with high sensitivity and resolution have generated much more reliable results for ur dbp monitoring charrois 2010 li 2014 most of the published literature has targeted one specific group of ur dbps bond et al 2012 krasner et al 2013 kadmi et al 2015 according to the authors best knowledge only one study comprehensively highlighted the comparison of different ur dbps groups and species based on available information hebert et al 2010 nevertheless the comparison was made based on data published prior to 2010 in recent years many ur dbps groups and species have been identified and separately studied with respect to their spatial and temporal behaviors therefore there is a great need for or an up to date review to compile recent research advances regarding ur dbps concentration level in dwdss occurrence frequency and associated toxicity in this study the recent literature related to the ur dbps in dwdss were comprehensively reviewed an indexing method was developed and applied to prioritize the selected ur dbps groups and species based on three criteria including the concentration level in dwdss reported frequency and toxicity with respect to human health exposure risk atsdr 2017 an importance index of each ur dbp is generated based on a holistic assessment of information on the three criteria based on the results the commonly occurring ur dbps are classified into different categories outlined in section 3 such prioritization of ur dbps can provide useful information to develop control strategies for the minimization of human health risk resulting from the exposure to ur dbps from source to the consumer end in addition the prioritization can help water regulators to establish new or modify current threshold levels for ur dbps additionally the information related to the physicochemical characteristics of commonly occurring ur dbps and the available guidelines for these ur dbps species are complied in this review 2 unregulated disinfection by products in this study ur dbps are defined as those dbps for which the threshold limits with respect to their concentrations in dwdss have not been set or imposed by the usepa wrf 2017 usepa 2008 the ur dbps were selected by compiling the data from 49 peer reviewed articles primarily published after 2010 which include the concentration levels of ur dbps in dwds and full scale water treatment plants i e the point from where treated water enters the dwds the articles were selected from a reference pool comprising more than 100 research articles articles which only reported laboratory investigations but no field data related to ur dbps concentrations were not selected for this review the scope and criteria of articles selection for this review is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 49 peer reviewed articles were selected based on the information related to ur dbps species concentration levels and their reporting frequencies in dwdss and water treatment plants science direct and engineering village were used as search engines the journals from where these articles were shortlisted include science of the total environment chemosphere water research mutation research journal of environmental sciences journal of hazardous materials journal of chromatography a environment monitoring assessment frontiers of environment science and engineering journal of water supply research and technology water science and technology journal american water works association philosophical transactions mathematical physical and engineering sciences journal of environmental science and technology journal of environmental engineering and sciences plos one and american chemical society in addition wiley book chapters and conference article from urban water security research alliance also reported ur dbps concentration values and thus the reported data from these sources was considered the keywords used for the literature searching include emerging dbps ur dbps disinfection water distribution systems health risks toxicity water analysis water quality chlorination drinking water treatment and water treatment plants among the selected literature approximately 70 of articles were published in elsevier s journal database and in elsevier s database 80 of articles are from water research chemosphere and science of total environment in total nine ur dbp groups and 36 different ur dbps species were identified for further review and prioritization 2 1 identified unregulated disinfection by products groups 2 1 1 haloacetonitriles haloacetonitriles hans in general are produced by chlorination chloramination and using chlorine dioxide as disinfectants in drinking water treatment muellner et al 2007 however use of chloramines has made the levels of hans more prominent in drinking water although hans have yet to be regulated they have been frequently reported in many studies farr et al 2012 muellner et al 2007 yu and reckhow 2015 shanks et al 2013 some species of hans are determined to be toxic muellner et al 2007 in addition increased concentrations of hans were observed in dwdss as a result of decreasing ph and increasing temperature conditions who 2011 hans form rapidly but decompose slowly in dwdss due to hydrolysis who 2011 according to the data collected for this review the concentration level of hans in drinking water ranged between 0 6 and 24 Î¼g l dichloroacetonitrile dcan is by far the most prominent species among hans detected in drinking waters who 2011 2 1 2 halonitromethanes there are nine species of halonitromethanes hnms reported in the selected literature richardson et al 1999 among all hnms the most commonly occurring species include trichloronitromethane tcnm dichloronitromethane dcnm and bromochloronitromethane bcnm tcnm is the mostly commonly detected hnm thompson et al 2015 it has been reported that the concentrations of hnms increase because of the use of pre ozonation before chlorine or chloramine treatment krasner et al 2006 based on the collected data for this review the concentration level of hnms is in between 0 16 and 1 50 Î¼g l 2 1 3 haloketones haloketones hks are considered as a volatile ur dbps group nikolaou et al 2001 and there are six species of hks identified in dwdss among these species trichloropropanone tcp and dichloropropanone dcp are the most commonly occurring hks farr et al 2012 in general hk concentrations vary throughout dwdss due to base catalyzed hydrolysis reactions and they are not stable in high ph 7 environments due to hydrolytic decomposition nikolaou et al 2001 andrzejewski et al 2003 although hks have been found to be carcinogenic and mutagenic there is no threshold or guideline value developed for hks in drinking water nikolaou et al 2001 the concentration level of hks generally falls within the range of 1 23 8 6 Î¼g l according to the data collected for this review 2 1 4 haloacetamides haloacetamides hams are another ur dbp group that has been identified in both dwds and laboratory studies at the species level limited information related to the toxicity of hams is known chu et al 2013 roughly 13 species of hams have been identified so far farr et al 2012 and the commonly found species are dibromoacetamide dbacam dichloroacetamide dcacam and trichloroacetamide tcacam hams can be formed in dwdss as a result of chloramination and ozonation without biofiltration during which hans are hydrolysed to hams farr et al 2012 the concentration level of hams was identified to be within a range of 1 50 7 Î¼g l 2 1 5 aldehydes aldehydes als is another important ur dbps group in this review als are categorized into two sub groups including halogenated als hals and non halogenated als nhals both groups are assessed separately according to the established criteria hals are an important class of ur dbps and considered as the third largest dbp class by weight according to a us nationwide dbp occurrence study postigo et al 2015 there are 10 species of hals that have been identified for this review jeong et al 2015 trichloroacetaldehyde tcal and dichloroacetaldehyde dcal are the most commonly occurring species of hals jeong et al 2015 there are some established threshold limit values for tcal as shown in table 5 in general dihalogenated species of hals are prone to be formed with the presence of chloramines and ozone the possible mechanism is that ozonation can increase the formation of low molecular weight oxygen containing organic by products such as aldehydes which can lead to the formation of hals agbaba et al 2016 trihalogenated species of hals occur more frequently when using chlorine instead of chloramine farr et al 2012 the other sub group nhals includes formaldehyde fal and acetaldehyde aal the formation of nhals is due to the combined use of chlorine and other oxidants for water disinfection in general the occurrence and formation mechanism of nhals are similar with different types of disinfectants reemtsma and jekel 2006 the threshold values of fal have been established in some states in the us as shown in table 5 despite a significant health risk the adverse health effects of aldehydes are still poorly understood as only a few species of aldehydes have established toxicity values lopachin and gavin 2014 2 1 6 n nitrosamines n nitrosamines nas are commonly detected in water samples from pools wastewater groundwater and drinking water kadmi et al 2015 the formation of nas in general is due to the reaction of monochloramine and organic amine precursors under typical chloramination condition krasner et al 2013 in addition the chlorination of nitrite in the presence of nitrosamine precursor also forms nas krasner et al 2013 there are eight species of commonly occurring nas according to the reported studies n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is the most recognized species of this group nawrocki and andrzejewski 2011 the ndma formation in drinking water is reported to have a link with ozonation the concentration levels of nas in drinking water are often reported in ng l which is relatively low as compared to other ur dbp groups in spite of low concentration levels nas are considered as toxic chen et al 2016 as many na species are listed in the contaminant candidate list 4 ccl 4 established by usepa the ccl 4 includes those contaminants which are not part of any drinking water regulations but are known to occur in dwdss usepa 2016 the concentration level of nas according to the data collected for this literature review ranged in between 10 and 90 ng l 0 01 0 09 Î¼g l 2 1 7 iodinated dbps iodinated dbps i dbps are another emerging group of ur dbps the concentration levels reported for i dbps in drinking water are either in ng l or low Î¼g l in general i dbps can be found in drinking water that is treated by chlorine chloramine and ozone in the presence of iodide in addition the water from coastal areas subject to salt water intrusion can increase the formation of i dbps richardson et al 2008 i dbps include species of iodo acids and iodo thms according to previous literature there are 5 species of iodo acids and 6 species of iodo thms that have been identified the commonly occurring ones include iodoacetic acid iaa and iodoform if farr et al 2012 according to data collected for this literature review the concentration level of i dbps ranged between 0 54 and 0 9 Î¼g l 2 1 8 cyanides in cyanides cnx group there is only one species i e cyanogen chloride cncl which is considered as the commonly occurring ur dbp cncl is formed due to the chloramination or chlorination of water who 2011 cncl has been found in finished drinking water usually at the concentration level below 10 Î¼g l who 2011 in addition high concentration levels of cncl were reported as a result of using chloramination as compared to chlorination cncl has acute toxic effects i e skin and eyes irritation dizziness and shortness of breath through oral inhalation and dermal exposure pathways however the related chronic effects on human health are not well defined yet na and olson 2004 the average concentration level of cncl in dwdss was found to be 4 Î¼g l goslan et al 2014 2 2 concentration levels and reported frequency the concentration levels and reported frequencies of commonly occurring ur dbp species are summarized in table 2 in many studies the concentration of an individual ur dbp species was reported more than one time in that case an average value was taken to make the concentration levels more representative moreover the reported frequencies of different ur dbp species in the selected articles were recorded as an indicator of the relative importance a higher reported frequency of ur dbps species represents a higher occurrence of the species in dwdss reflecting a higher relative importance the concentration levels and reported frequencies were converted into scores shown in section 3 1 and 3 2 which were used for prioritization of ur dbps species 2 3 toxicological properties toxicological properties are defined as hazard endpoints by which we can measure or asses the adverse effects of substance or chemicals on human health klaassen and watkins iii 2015 in general ur dbps are considered more toxic to human health as compared to r dbps richardson et al 2007 some species of nitrogenous ur dbps and iodinated ur dbps are considered as 2 and 250 times more toxic than the r dbps respectively wrf 2017 kimura et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 table 3 shows the toxicological properties of selected ur dbps species as shown in table 3 acute toxicity oral and inhalation mutagenicity carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were selected to define toxicological endpoints the selection of these hazards endpoints was based on the following facts 1 oral exposure route is generally considered as the most common exposure route of intake for ur dbps wang et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 2 inhalation is another important exposure route and risk contributor wang et al 2007 particularly in showering in some cases inhalation pathway can be the most critical dbp exposure route basu et al 2011 3 mutagenicity refers to a permanent change in genetic material of a cell or organism mutagenicity of ur dbps was selected to estimate the heritable damages such as growth and development damages i e low birth weight congenital malformations behavioral defects delayed appearance of early postnatal landmarks and growth retardation to the offspring of parents exposed to the mutagens trasler and doerksen 1999 gruiz et al 2015 4 carcinogenicity is another important toxicological endpoint for ur dbps as various epidemiological investigations linked cancer occurrence to chlorinated drinking water villanueva et al 2003 stewart and wild 2014 in addition there are still ongoing studies investigating the relation between dbps and cancer villanueva et al 2015 particularly with a focus on identifying the relationship between the ur dbps exposure and various cancer risks villanueva et al 2015 5 a large number of dbps are considered to be cytotoxic and genotoxic chinese hamster ovary cho cells are widely used in toxicology to assess the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity potency of dbps wagner and plewa 2017 quantitative cytotoxicity and genotoxicity data derived from the toxicity assays on the cho cells is available for more than 100 dbps the information on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity is helpful to the dbp researchers when comparing the measured dbps concentration by the metrics of toxic potency li and mitch 2018 inclusion of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity endpoints can generate more comprehensive toxicity profiles of commonly occurring ur dbps 2 4 physiochemical properties physiochemical properties are important in terms of assessing the behavior of ur dbps chiou et al 1977 these properties can help to describe the fate and transport modelling in environmental risk assessment in addition they have a strong impact on the exposure mechanism of ur dbps wolf and schwenk 2014 for example oral ingestion is the most common route of exposure which depends on the bioavailability and environmental fate of substance bioavailability largely depends on the water solubility of the substance and thus it is linked with oral ingestion savjani et al 2012 the partition coefficient kow can be used as a screening test to identify the ur dbp species with a significant bioaccumulation potential jorgensen and johnsen 2011 similarly the vapour pressure is important to asses the ur dbp exposure higher vapour pressures generally result in faster evaporation rates transport canada 2009 the henry s law constant can be used to asses the volatility of species as it is the measure of chemical partition between air and water at equilibrium jayjock et al 2000 in addition the effects of water solubility on genotoxicity have also been observed in previous studies christie 2007 table 4 lists some common physicochemical properties of ur dbps species 2 5 established guidelines and threshold levels the difference between a guideline and a standard is that a guideline is non enforceable and when a guideline is enforced it becomes a standard dunn et al 2014 bc 2017 although for ur dbps there is no standard issued by the usepa however developing threshold levels for these species is necessary and considered as a shared responsibility which requires contributions from various stakeholders at municipal provincial and federal levels health canada 2015 drinking water authorities need to include ur dbps in water quality benchmarking to better monitor and evaluate system performance hence many states have devised their own threshold values for some ur dbp species similarly many organizations have also set some guideline values for various ur dbp species including the usepa the available threshold level and guideline for ur dbps species set by different states and organizations are shown in table 5 echa 2018 nhmrc 2011 ministry of health people s republic of china 2006 the water supply water quality regulations 2000 ministry of health 2008 ministry of health labour and welfare 2004 usepa 2017b state water resources control board california 2017 ontario regulation 2017 who 2011 kadmi et al 2015 some of the ur dbps in table 5 are included in drinking water standards in some countries however in the majority of cases there are only guideline values are available for these ur dbps in some cases where the ur dbps are part of drinking water standards they still come under non regular indices which mean they are applicable in special regions times and cases ministry of health people s republic of china 2006 according to the safe drinking water act implemented by the usepa they can still be referred to as ur dbps it can be seen in table 5 that guidelines and threshold levels have been developed for some species of hans als and nas by many organizations and states indicating that these ur dbps group have gained relative more importance in terms of their occurrence however there are still no guidelines or threshold values for other commonly occurring ur dbps groups i e hks hnms and hams 3 proposed prioritization method the purpose of prioritization is to evaluate ur dbps species based on the defined criteria i e concentration levels reported frequency and toxicity this will identify important ur dbps species that need to be addressed in terms of setting up threshold limits improving the monitoring in dwdss i e to gather further data on their variability and reducing their exposure by applying various controlling strategies in water treatment after this prioritization ur dbps species can be divide into three categories namely critical priority medium priority and low priority the critical priority category includes those species that are important in terms of setting up guidelines or applying water quality controls the medium priority category is required to be addressed after the critical priority category the low priority category includes those species that are either not important based on current available information or require further investigation fig 2 shows the proposed prioritization method used to categorize ur dbps species ranking of different ur dbp groups and species can be done using an indexing system as shown in fig 2 n groups are considered a b and n as an example and each group can have different numbers of species the scores of individual ur dbp species are calculated and aggregated to generate a group score hence the prioritization of groups is not only dependent on individual species scores but also on the number of species present in different groups this prioritization method can be applied to any number of ur dbp groups and species the indexing system is a cost effective and less time consuming process for generating a simple measurement from multi dimensional information which has gained widespread acceptance in system performance benchmarking bonin and stevenson 2013 rosenblum and lapp 1989 hu et al 2018 in this study the species score is calculated as 1 species score concentration level reported frequency toxicity it can be seen from eq 1 that a species score is calculated based on three criteria including concentration level reported frequency and toxicity the criteria were selected because they are relevant to the human health risks caused by ur dbp exposure asante duah 2017 to quantify the human health risk it is important to know the toxicity and exposure of ur dbps toxicity is referred to potential adverse effects and levels at which ur dbps have an impact on human health the exposure assessment describes the magnitude frequency and duration for human being exposed to ur dbps usepa 2012 the three mentioned criteria cover aspects related to human health exposure risk assessment for example the concentration levels and reported frequency can collectively describe the extent and frequency of ur dbps exposure this can be combined with the toxicity of ur dbps to measure the overall impact of ur dbps if a species has a high concentration level but low reported frequency and toxicity then it will not be rated as highly important due to low occurrence and low human health hazard if a species has a high toxicity but very low concentration level and reported frequency it will also not be considered important however if a species has a medium to high concentration level toxicity and reported frequency then it will be considered as important the following sections give the details of criteria used for the species score calculation 3 1 concentration levels the concentration levels of different ur dbps species in dwdss vary significantly table 2 in order to develop the scores for different concentration levels a cumulative distribution function cdf was applied smeets 2010 the concentration levels are distributed along the percentiles and scores are assigned to percentile values chen and kultgen 2016 high concentration levels are associated with high percentile values accordingly scores are assigned from 1 to 10 with a high score value representing a high concentration level and vice versa to develop a cdf a statistical software minitab 18 was used and the following steps are considered 1 identify the applicable cdf curve for the given data 2 assign scores by plotting the percentiles of the concentration levels the selection of a specific cdf distribution among various applicable distributions is based on two parameters i e the anderson darling ad statistic and p values the concentration levels of all ur dbps followed the gamma distribution pattern the percentile values developed are used further to develop the concentration level scores the concentration scores corresponding to different percentile values are shown in table 6 based on the scores the species are prioritized using a qualitative scale if concentration level is 90th percentile of data then it is a high priority score 10 if concentration level is 90th percentile of the data but 50th percentile then it is a moderate priority score 5 7 if concentration level is 50th percentile of the data but is 20th percentile then it is a low priority score 2 3 and if concentration level 20th percentile of the data then it is a very low priority score 2 3 2 reported frequency reported frequency data was collected by calculating the number of times that a particular ur dbp species has been reported in selected peer reviewed articles the concept of cdf was also applied for reported frequency data in a similar way as mentioned for concentration level data this data matches the log normal distribution the developed scoring criteria for reported frequency is shown in table 6 based on the scores species are prioritized using a qualitative scale which includes if reported frequency is 90th percentile of data then it is a high priority score 10 if reported frequency is 90th percentile of the data but is 70th percentile then it is a moderate priority score 6 if reported frequency is 70th percentile of the data but is 30th percentile then it is a low priority score 2 4 and if reported frequency 30th percentile of the data then it is a very low priority score 2 3 3 toxicity in toxicity the endpoints for acute toxicity e g oral and inhalation and mutagenicity were developed using the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemical ghs guidelines un 2013 for carcinogenicity the international agency for research on cancer iarc classification bouvard et al 2009 was used these endpoints are used internationally for chemical toxicity communication cytotoxicity and genotoxicity endpoints were also considered for a more comprehensive overall toxicity evaluation the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity data available for different ur dbps were collected from various published literature the scoring criteria for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity was developed using the lowest toxic concentration values and cdf table 6 shows the scoring criteria for all considered toxicity endpoints as shown in table 6 a high score value represents a high toxicity and vice versa in addition the endpoint of acute toxicity through inhalation is shown in both ppm vol and mg l as mentioned in the ghs classification system un 2013 the inhalation toxicity unit is a function of the form of the inhaled material and the reported values for inhalation are either in mg m3 or in ppm vol hence two classification endpoints are used that include gas mg m3 and mist ppm vol un 2013 if inhalation toxicity value is reported in both mg m3 and ppm vol then the most conservative value will be selected in addition the final acute toxicity score is calculated as the most conservative value higher score among the individual oral and inhalation toxicity scores the overall toxicity is evaluated as a combination of acute toxicity mutagenicity carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity hence the overall toxicity score is generated by aggregating the scores of the five toxicity endpoints selected desesso and john 1987 as shown in eq 2 2 toxicity i 1 5 toxicity type where 1 is acute toxicity 2 is mutagenicity 3 is carcinogenicity 4 is cytotoxicity and 5 is genotoxicity all hazard endpoints including acute toxicity i e oral and inhalation mutagenicity carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity are considered as equally important in the calculation of total toxicity score carcinogenicity is the ability to cause cancer and mutagenicity is the ability to change the genetic material which may cause abnormalities and disease both carcinogenicity and mutagenicity are irreversible adverse human health effects health canada 2008 similarly acute toxicity represents the dose that will cause mortality and other serious toxicological effects haschek and rousseaux 2013 acute toxicity can be helpful in setting up hazard classification and providing information for the comparison of toxicity and dose response relationship among various species of ur dbps hodgson 2004 moreover cytotoxicity assesses the health effects of ur dbps in terms of altering cell morphology and cell growth mcgaw et al 2014 genotoxicity assesses the destructive effects of ur dbps on cells genetic material e g dna rna shah 2012 based on the overall toxicity scores the species are prioritized in terms of adverse human health effects using a qualitative toxicity classification scale as shown in table 7 in section 4 the scale was also developed using the cdf on the calculated overall toxicity scores 3 4 species scores the calculated species scores using eq 1 were normalized into a scale between 0 and 1 the species scores were converted to a scale of 0 100 using a scale up coefficient where 0 represents the minimum score and 100 represents the maximum score the purpose of normalization is to make results easy to understand by avoiding the comparison of the quantities measured in different units perini et al 2006 han et al 2011 there are various methods for data normalization among these methods dividing the data by the largest value is a commonly used normalization method using this method each value can be expressed as a percentage of the largest observed value and a linear transformation on the original data can be achieved tofallis 2014 coulter et al 2006 eq 3 shows the formula used for the normalization of species scores 3 normalized score x x m a x 100 where x actual species score x max the maximum value among all actual species scores and the scale up coefficient is 100 based on the species scores ur dbps are grouped into critical medium and low priority categories the scores of species under the same ur dbps group are aggregated to generate a score for the group 4 results the prioritization method along with criteria and developed endpoints were applied on the selected commonly occurring ur dbps species the scores with respect to the three criteria i e concentration level reported frequency and toxicity were calculated in addition criteria scores were combined using eq 1 to obtain species scores which were further used to calculate the group scores fig 3 shows the scores of ur dbps species measured on the three criteria in addition priority levels of species have been defined using a qualitative scale fig 3 a shows that tcp dcan and some species of hals and nhals have high concentration scores as their concentration levels lie above the 90th percentile value according to scale developed for concentration level table 6 all selected species of nas excluding ndma are associated with low concentration scores as their concentration levels were below the 20th percentile of the given data according to fig 3 b the maximum score was given to those species having the reported frequency above the 90th percentile according to the scale for reporting frequency shown in table 6 the species with high reported frequency scores include ndma dcan tcnm and bromochloracetonitrile bcan the lowest score was given to those species having reported frequency values lower than the 30th percentile value of the collected frequency data the ur dbps species with low reported frequency scores are if n nitrosopiperidine npip n nitrosodipropylamine ndpa bromoacetonitrile mban dcnm iaa and all species of hals except tcal fig 3 c shows that species of nas including n nitrosomorpholine nmor and npip along with tcal have the highest overall toxicity scores both nmor and npip are possible carcinogenic to humans and have a moderate acute toxicity whereas tcal is probable carcinogenic and has a high acute toxicity us national library of medicine 2017a in addition nmor and npip have high mutagenicity and genotoxicity whereas tcal has high mutagenicity and moderate cytotoxicity table 7 shows a qualitative priority scale along with percentiles of overall toxicity scores according to table 7 a high priority level was given to species with a toxicity score of 29 or greater i e 90th percentile value of the data a moderate priority level was given to species having a score in the range of 21 28 i e 90th percentile but 60th percentile value of the data a low priority level was given to species having scores in the range between 13 and 20 i e 60th percentile but 20th percentile value of the data very low priority was given to those species having scores less than 13 i e 20th percentile value of the data some species of hals and one species of hams i e dibromoacetamide dbacam were given very low scores owing to their relatively low overall toxicity moreover it is noteworthy that many data gaps were identified for the species of hals and hams for example data gaps for the species of hals except cal and tcal in terms of acute toxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity have increased the uncertainty in the overall toxicity assessment results 4 1 species score fig 4 shows the overall species scores calculated for all selected ur dbps species the scaled scores of ur dbps were categorised into three priority levels i e critical medium and low priority the cut off values for prioritizing ur dbps species were identified based on the calculated species scores and the authors judgement the following criteria were developed if the species score was 70 then the ur dbp species was classified into the critical category if the species score was 70 but 20 then it came under the medium priority category species with a score 20 came under the low priority following the developed criteria dcan and tcal comes under the critical category with the scores of 100 and 71 respectively species with the score ranged between 21 and 54 including tcnm fal tcp dban dcp aal bcan and ndma were grouped into the medium priority category the species having lower scores than ndma score 21 came under the low priority category such as all species of hams i dbps and cnx and some species of hals nas hans and hnms the scaled scores of species within the same ur dbp group were aggregated to generate a group score as mentioned in section 3 4 table 8 shows the aggregated ur dbps group scores as can be seen hans have the highest group score among all selected groups due to the high scores of its species i e dcan bcan and dban similarly hals comes second after hans with tcal as a dominant species nhals comes after hals with fal and aal made up the total group score combining the group scores of hals and nhals makes als almost equally important as hans i e hals group score 169 and hans group score 172 the hks group comes after the nhals but the difference in group scores between nhals and hks was not much hnms come after hks and followed by nas the group score of hnms is determined by three identified species among which tcnm is the most prominent one for nas the group score was aggregated from the species scores of eight species with ndma being the most prominent one in addition hams cnx and i dbps have relatively low group scores either due to a low number of species or low relative importance of species determined using the developed prioritization method 5 discussion based on the results the ur dbps within the three priority categories are discussed along with the implications of this prioritization 5 1 critical priority dcan with high concentration levels high reported frequency and moderate toxicity has been given the highest scaled species score and is classified into the critical priority category hans is one of the main nitrogenous dbp groups identified and within this group dcan has a major contribution in terms of concentration levels tan et al 2017 who 2011 previous canadian surveys showed that the reported frequency of dcan in all water samples was around 97 williams et al 1997 in south korea the concentration level of dcan in drinking water has been reported to be around 40 Î¼g l shin et al 2013 which is nearly two times higher than the value given in the provisional guidelines for dcan by who who 2011 in the usa concentrations higher than 20 Î¼g l have been recorded for dcan in dwdss similarly tcal with relatively high concentration moderate reported frequency and high toxicity has been classified as having a critical priority after dcan tcal is a part of hals an important ur dbp group postigo et al 2015 tcal is the most extensively investigated hal in drinking water and contributes to almost 60 of the total hals jeong et al 2015 in the united states the maximum concentration of tcal was found to be around 46 Î¼g l whereas in canadian dwdss the concentration has been recorded up to 263 Î¼g l in water treated by ozone and chlorine jeong et al 2015 5 2 medium priority fal and aal were classified into the medium priority category due to their high concentration level low reported frequency and low to high toxicity fal scored the highest group score within the medium priority category according to the developed indexing method however both fal and aal are dominant nhals in water as they are identified with carcinogenic and mutagenic effects lugwisha et al 2016 some previous studies have concluded that fal is more toxic than aal til et al 1988 in addition to the high human health toxicity these aldehydes may cause changes to water taste and color lugwisha et al 2016 tcp and dcp come under the medium priority category due to their moderate to high concentration level moderate reported frequency and low toxicity as mentioned tcp and dcp are considered as the main species in hks group nikolaou et al 2001 in addition it has been observed that concentration levels of tcp and dcp vary in dwdss mainly due to the oxidation of dcp into tcp in the presence of free chlorine guilherme and rodriguez 2015 hence it is important to study their concentrations at different points in dwdss in order to understand their behavior to minimize the exposure bcan and dban are species of the hans group these species were classified in the medium priority category due to their moderate concentration level moderate to high reported frequency and low to moderate toxicity previous studies showed that dban has been identified as carcinogenic based on animal test results templeton et al 2010 hence it has been rated high on the toxicity scale in comparison bcan is considered as moderately toxic templeton et al 2010 among hans the concentration levels of bcan and dban are low as compared to dcan concentration level in dwdss hara 2013 considering the species of hnms the most common and prominent species is tcnm goslan et al 2014 it is classified into the medium priority category due to its moderate concentration level high reported frequency and high toxicity the tcnm is the first species among hnms that was identified in drinking water le roux et al 2011 however the toxicological data of tcnm is still inadequate to develop guideline values who 2011 the tcnm concentrations on average were reported to be around 0 6 Î¼g l and the maximum concentration can be as high as 5 6 Î¼g l who 2011 among nas the only species that comes under medium priority category is ndma which is due to its moderate toxicity high reported frequency and low concentration level ndma has become a significant health concern in drinking water supply due to their high carcinogenic potency liew et al 2016 in addition the occurrence of ndma has been reported more frequently as compared to any other species of nas liew et al 2016 previous studies showed that ndma concentration levels in chlorinated or chloraminated drinking water are generally less than 10 ng l 0 01 Î¼g l however with longer residence time the concentration levels are reported to be 100 ng l 0 10 Î¼g l charrois et al 2007 5 3 low priority using the developed prioritization method 26 out of 36 species were grouped into the low priority category among these 26 species dcacam and cncl are the top two important species of this category both dcacam and cncl have moderate concentration levels low reported frequency and low to moderate toxicity in addition some species in the low priority category have still no established toxicity values and there is a need to fill the toxicological data gaps for these species apart from the identified ur dbps in this study several unregulated brominated haas have also been identified in drinking waters there has been an increasing concern over these unregulated brominate haas in the past particularly in source water with a high bromide concentration however according to the data collected for this study there was not much information available for unregulated brominated haas the data gaps for unregulated brominated haas species were also reported by samson et al 2017 several modelling techniques have been used to estimate the concentrations of unregulated brominated haas samson et al 2017 also the usepa has proposed the fourth unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr 4 specifically targeting at brominated haas usepa 2018 based on this rule brominated haas will be monitored in public water systems in the next coming years to assess their occurrence for future decision making it is expected that more monitoring data will be generated in the near future for these unregulated brominated haas 6 implication of prioritization in recent years research is taking a new direction towards the better understanding of ur dbps occurrence and behaviors this study grouped the recently studied ur dbps species into critical medium and low priority categories the species within the critical priority category can be studied further in terms of their kinetics to understand the formation mechanisms and epidemiological impacts in addition the regulatory authorities water utilities and scientific communities can use the results of this prioritization for different purposes 1 water regulators can identify the ur dbps species that are under critical priority category and possibly have a maximum exposure to the public hence this review on a preliminary basis can provide the list of critical ur dbps species which needs to be considered in developing guidelines or threshold limits 2 the results of the prioritization can help the scientific community in the selection of important ur dbp groups and species to carry out further in depth studies in general regulations and research can be the drivers of each other hence comprehensive studies on occurrence and toxicity of ur dbps are necessary these studies can include the understanding of ur dbps formation mechanisms and the results can potentially facilitate the water regulators in developing or setting threshold limits 3 water utilities can use the prioritization results in selection of disinfection alternatives and developing water quality management plans in nutshell water utilities can use the prioritization as a reference to identify the important ur dbp species which need to be controlled in the system to deliver safe drinking water this prioritization can also help water utilities in allocating resources to monitor the occurrence of most critical ur dbp species for example if an ur dbp species is highly toxic to human health but its concentration level and reported frequency are low then this species might not be considered a high priority from the water utilities perspective in terms of applying water quality control on the other hand if a species is associated with moderate toxicity but the concentration level and reported frequency is high then it can be a priority for water utilities as there is a higher chance of exposure hebert et al 2010 has also prioritized ur dbps based on available published data before 2010 the selection criteria used to evaluate the priority was different from the criteria used in this review in addition the indexing methods were different hebert et al 2010 used toxicity as a criterion covering mutagenicity genotoxicity and carcinogenicity whereas this review covers toxicity more comprehensively including acute toxicity mutagenicity carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity hebert et al 2010 considered occurrence as a combination of detection frequency and concentration and then aggregated the occurrence score with toxicity and regulation or classification scores this review considered the concentration level and the reported frequency of ur dbps species separately in addition this review did not consider the developed guidelines or threshold values of ur dbps in prioritization species which were categorized as having a low priority by hebert et al 2010 are also considered as low priority according to criteria of this review including some species of hams hals hnms and i dbps however there are some species such as tcp dcp and dcan were rated as having a low priority according to hebert et al 2010 but they have moderate to critical priority according to this review in addition the species of nhals i e fal and aal were considered to have high priorities according to hebert et al 2010 but in this review they are considered to have a medium priority the possible reason for this difference is that several spatial and temporal studies on ur dbp species have been carried out in recent years which leads to more available data for ur dbps prioritization the results for species of nas reported by hebert et al 2010 were slightly different from the results of this review however ndma is considered the most prominent species among nas in both hebert et al 2010 and this review there are some other studies published in recent years evaluating the formation of dbps i e both r dbps and ur dbps these studies characterized and quantified different r dbps and ur dbps generated from different wastewater treatment strategies and coastal groundwater zeng et al 2016 szczuka et al 2017 chuang and mitch 2017 these studies also incorporated the factor of toxicity along with concentration levels to evaluate the relative importance of the dbps i e both r dbps and ur dbps zeng et al 2016 szczuka et al 2017 chuang and mitch 2017 for example zeng et al 2016 and chuang and mitch 2017 studied the formation of r dbps and ur dbps in wastewater more particularly considering different wastewater treatment trains both studies evaluated the effects of various wastewater treatment technologies to evaluate the concentration of dbps which were further weighted by incorporating the factors of toxicities the concentration of dbps in wastewater is generally different from that in drinking water primarily due to difference in nom concentration also known as effluent organic matter in the case of wastewater wert et al 2007 the study by szczuka et al 2017 investigated ur dbp formation from saline groundwater these studies have also provided information of dbps i e r dbps and ur dbps in terms their concentration levels and toxicity in coastal groundwater in addition the dbps were also assessed by applying certain water treatment and elevating the bromide concentration in coastal groundwater in comparison this critical review comprehensively prioritized various ur dbps in water treatment plants and dwdss not only by considering concentration levels and toxicity but also taking the reported frequency into consideration the reported frequency can address the importance of ur dbps species at a very broad level this gives the readers a holistic picture of those ur dbps which are being investigated or require more attention the information presented in this critical review is not limited to one study or situation in fact it evaluates ur dbps based on data collected from studies occurring in different parts of the world additionally the above mentioned studies used cytotoxicity as an endpoint to assess the toxicity of ur dbps however in this critical review the toxicity of ur dbps was evaluated by combining five toxicological endpoints including acute toxicity mutagenicity carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity the information generated from this critical review will enable water managers and regulators to understand the broader picture of ur dbps their occurrence and their possible impacts on human health 7 conclusions and recommendations ur dbps are receiving increasing attention from the scientific community and water regulators due to their high toxicity as compared to r dbps in addition ur dbp concentration levels are detectable in dwdss owing to the advancement in analytical techniques and the increase in the use of alternative disinfectants this review article not only listed the ur dbps reported in recent literature but also prioritized them into three categories i e critical medium and low priorities based on three criteria including concentration level reported frequency and toxicity the results show that ur dbp species according to the measured species scores can be ranked in a descending order as dcan tcal tcnm fal tcp dban dcp aal bcan ndma the rank can help drinking water stakeholders to identify the critical ur dbps species it can also serve as a reference in various epidemiological risk assessment and kinetics based studies to better assess human health risks due to exposure to harmful ur dbps it is recommended to have more field investigations on ur dbps identified as critical to obtain more information for preventing their formation in dwdss it is also important to investigate the formation mechanisms for these selected ur dbps which could facilitate water regulators in proposing suitable water treatment strategies or technologies to control ur dbp formation there are many emerging water treatment technologies available to minimize ur dbps formation particularly in terms of removing nom from drinking water these include coagulation based systems dissolved air flotation direct filtration and oxidation and membrane based systems 8 study limitations the species scores calculated are based on the selected criteria and the selection of criteria is a subjective process different scores will be generated for the same ur dbps based on different sets of evaluation criteria in addition the toxicity data for some ur dbps species i e species of hams hnms and hals was not available increasing the uncertainty in prioritization these mentioned species fall within the low priority category based on the developed scoring criteria a comprehensive research on exposure and toxicity of these ur dbps within the low priority category is required this will further help to accurately measure the health risks to the public and better management solutions could be devised the ur dbps groups scores are based on the aggregated scores of species and in this review only those species which are commonly reported in the published articles are considered hence the score of a group is not completely representative of all the species within the group there might be many ur dbp species that are not measured or identified in dwdss and there is also a possibility that some ur dbps were identified but receive less research interest hence with more efforts to understand the occurrence of these ur dbps in dwdss might change the priority order of ur dbps identified in this study it is also expected that many other ur dbps which are not listed in this study will be discovered in the coming years acknowledgements the authors would like to thank natural sciences and engineering research council of canada for

19227,water disinfection involves the use of different types of disinfectants which are oxidizing agents that react with natural organic matter nom to form disinfection by products dbps the united states environmental protection agency usepa has established threshold limits on some dbps which are known as regulated dbps r dbps the human health risks associated with r dbps in drinking water distribution systems dwdss and application of stricter regulations have led water utilities to switch from conventional disinfectant i e chlorination to alternative disinfectants however the use of alternative disinfectants causes formation of a new suit of dbps known as unregulated dbps ur dbps which in many cases can be more toxic there is a growing concern of ur dbps formation in drinking water this review prioritizes some commonly occurring ur dbp groups and species in dwdss based on their concentration level reported frequency and toxicity using an indexing method there are nine ur dbps group and 36 species that have been identified based on recent published peer reviewed articles haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetaldehydes hals are identified as important ur dbp groups dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloroacetaldehye tcal are identified as critical ur dbps species the outcomes of this review can help water regulators to identify the most critical ur dbps species in the context of drinking water safety and provide them with useful information to develop guidelines or threshold limits for ur dbps the outcomes can also help water utilities in selecting water treatment processes for the mitigation of human health risk posed by ur dbps through drinking water graphical abstract image 1 keywords unregulated disinfection by products drinking water distribution systems prioritization concentration level toxicity reported frequency 1 introduction disinfection is the most common process for inactivating microorganisms water disinfection is an important step for drinking water treatment and it has been in practice for over one hundred years cheung 2017 the disinfectants used in water treatment processes are various oxidants including chlorine chlorine dioxide chloramine and ozone they react with natural organic matter nom in drinking water distribution systems dwdss to form disinfection by products dbps among all disinfectants chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant worldwide richardson and postigo 2015 zwiener 2006 guilherme and rodriguez 2014 richardson et al 2007 dbps have been in the spotlight since 1974 hrudey et al 2015 and since then plenty of research has been conducted to increase the understanding of dbps in terms of their formation processes and exposure levels in dwdss and the associated human health effects guilherme and rodriguez 2015 richardson et al 2007 li and mitch 2018 to date around 700 dbps have been identified in drinking waters thun et al 2017 among all the reported dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloaceticacids haas are the most extensively investigated groups in epidemiological studies hebert et al 2010 sadiq and rodriguez 2004 dbps present a potential threat to human health as many of them are considered carcinogenic mutagenic and reproductive toxicants hrudey 2008 cheung 2017 freeman et al 2017 ahmad and husain 2015 dbps can enter the human body and impair human health by multiple exposure routes for example oral intake of drinking water that contains high concentration dbps inhalation of dbps in the air when water is rigorously agitated e g taking a shower or swimming and adsorption through skin contact cehtp 2015 villanueva et al 2015 xu and weisel 2003 considering the potential adverse human health effects richardson et al 2002 the united states environmental protection agency usepa has prescribed threshold limits on some dbps in dwdss the dbps that have the imposed threshold limits defined by the usepa are known as regulated dbps r dbps benson et al 2017 the usepa initiated a stage 1 dbp rule in 1998 to ensure public health protection by reducing the exposure to dbps usepa 2010 the stage 1 dbp rule considers dbp sampling based on the maximum residence time which does not necessarily represent the highest dbp concentration levels especially considering the dbps that are likely to degrade in dwdss the stage 1 rule was upgraded to a stage 2 rule in january 2006 which underlines increased protection against potential human health effects by establishing more strict compliance monitoring requirements for the r dbps usepa 2010 in stage 2 rule the maximum contaminant level mcl is measured by considering locational running annual averages instead of the overall annual average the mcl is the legal allowable threshold limit of a dbp s concentration in dwdss under the safe drinking water act sdwa hence it should not be exceeded at each monitoring site in addition the stage 2 rule enforces dwdss operators to monitor operation by applying operational evaluation levels oels for calculating oel the annual monitoring results are first divided into four quarters and then an average of the monitoring results in two previous quarters is taken and combined with two times the current quarter monitoring results to get the final value this helps to predict the likelihood of exceeding the mcl for the next quarter and to make operational changes accordingly usepa 2008 pennsylvania 2013 table 1 shows the list of r dbp groups along with their mcls and possible human health effects usepa 2017a the formation of dbps and their concentrations in drinking water depend on many factors including disinfectant types source water characteristics operational conditions water temperature and water residence time in dwdss krasner 2009 these factors interact with each other in real systems making dbp risk assessment a challenging task the dbp formation and behavior in dwdss can be predicted or calculated using predictive or mechanistic models these models help water utility managers and regulators in decision making of applying controls to reduce exposure and establishing threshold limits sadiq and rodriguez 2004 2011 mechanistic models generally represent the parameters as a function of time the development of a mechanistic model is often complex as it involves the chemical reactions between nom and disinfectants hence predictive models are generally preferred over mechanistic models sadiq and rodriguez 2011 loucks and van beek 2017 more than a hundred models have been developed for predicting r dbps to control their human health exposure by applying optimum disinfectant dose and monitoring r dbp formation these models are not developed to predict all r dbps together however they are separate models developed for different r dbps groups and species the r dbps groups for which predictive models have been developed include thms haas bromate and chlorite in addition separate models have been developed for different species of thms and haas powell et al 2005 fischer 2015 islam et al 2016 sadiq and rodriguez 2011 ahmad and husain 2015 leavey roback et al 2016 sohn et al 2004 ged et al 2015 using chlorine as a disinfectant also known as chlorination has several advantages including it is effective against most microorganisms can oxidize iron and manganese to avoid unpleasant tastes in water and is likely to maintain residual chlorine content in dwdss washington state 2004 in general disinfection is applied at water treatment plants but for large dwdss adding disinfectants in the dwds might be needed adding disinfectants in dwds is also known as a booster chlorination station booster chlorination station maintains the residual levels of disinfectants for pathogen control however this process can increase the formation of dbps goslan emma 2017 the formation of dbps particularly r dbps is mainly associated with chlorine to avoid the formation of chorine derived dbps several alternative disinfectants e g chloramines ozone and chlorine dioxide have been considered for drinking water treatment chloramine has been increasingly used for secondary disinfection the main advantage of using chloramine instead of chlorine is that chloramine can reduce the formation of r dbps and other chemical compounds which cause undesirable taste and odor in drinking waters in addition chloramine can control biofilm growth as it can penetrate biofilms more effectively compared to chlorine liu et al 2016 however chloramine can favor the formation of n nitrosamines nas le roux et al 2010 the use of chloramine for drinking water disinfection is not allowed in some european countries such as france italy and germany the united kingdom and spain are the few european countries that allow the use of chloramines for residual disinfection amy 2007 ozonation is another effective drinking water disinfection approach but this process is prone to form r dbps such as bromate in drinking waters washington state 2004 the use of these alternative disinfectants in dwdss have reduced the formation of r dbps as compared to conventional disinfection e g chlorination li et al 2017 krasner 2009 however these alternative disinfectants have raised new concerns by introducing a new suite of dbps known as emerging or un regulated dbps ur dbps legay et al 2015 krasner 2009 hence in recent years the scientific community has focused more on ur dbps to understand their formation mechanisms concentration levels and associated adverse human health effects richardson and postigo 2015 leavey roback et al 2016 chen and westerhoff 2010 guilherme and rodriguez 2015 krasner 2009 many comprehensive studies especially related to the spatial and temporal investigations of ur dbp groups and species in dwdss have been conducted marcoux et al 2017 wang et al 2015a b guilherme and rodriguez 2014 serrano et al 2015 wei et al 2010 liu 2014 in addition analytical advancement enables the analysis of ur dbps even at trace levels in drinking water for example some ur dbps like nas occur at very low concentrations ng l the use of novel sampling extraction and analytical methods such as liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry with high sensitivity and resolution have generated much more reliable results for ur dbp monitoring charrois 2010 li 2014 most of the published literature has targeted one specific group of ur dbps bond et al 2012 krasner et al 2013 kadmi et al 2015 according to the authors best knowledge only one study comprehensively highlighted the comparison of different ur dbps groups and species based on available information hebert et al 2010 nevertheless the comparison was made based on data published prior to 2010 in recent years many ur dbps groups and species have been identified and separately studied with respect to their spatial and temporal behaviors therefore there is a great need for or an up to date review to compile recent research advances regarding ur dbps concentration level in dwdss occurrence frequency and associated toxicity in this study the recent literature related to the ur dbps in dwdss were comprehensively reviewed an indexing method was developed and applied to prioritize the selected ur dbps groups and species based on three criteria including the concentration level in dwdss reported frequency and toxicity with respect to human health exposure risk atsdr 2017 an importance index of each ur dbp is generated based on a holistic assessment of information on the three criteria based on the results the commonly occurring ur dbps are classified into different categories outlined in section 3 such prioritization of ur dbps can provide useful information to develop control strategies for the minimization of human health risk resulting from the exposure to ur dbps from source to the consumer end in addition the prioritization can help water regulators to establish new or modify current threshold levels for ur dbps additionally the information related to the physicochemical characteristics of commonly occurring ur dbps and the available guidelines for these ur dbps species are complied in this review 2 unregulated disinfection by products in this study ur dbps are defined as those dbps for which the threshold limits with respect to their concentrations in dwdss have not been set or imposed by the usepa wrf 2017 usepa 2008 the ur dbps were selected by compiling the data from 49 peer reviewed articles primarily published after 2010 which include the concentration levels of ur dbps in dwds and full scale water treatment plants i e the point from where treated water enters the dwds the articles were selected from a reference pool comprising more than 100 research articles articles which only reported laboratory investigations but no field data related to ur dbps concentrations were not selected for this review the scope and criteria of articles selection for this review is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 49 peer reviewed articles were selected based on the information related to ur dbps species concentration levels and their reporting frequencies in dwdss and water treatment plants science direct and engineering village were used as search engines the journals from where these articles were shortlisted include science of the total environment chemosphere water research mutation research journal of environmental sciences journal of hazardous materials journal of chromatography a environment monitoring assessment frontiers of environment science and engineering journal of water supply research and technology water science and technology journal american water works association philosophical transactions mathematical physical and engineering sciences journal of environmental science and technology journal of environmental engineering and sciences plos one and american chemical society in addition wiley book chapters and conference article from urban water security research alliance also reported ur dbps concentration values and thus the reported data from these sources was considered the keywords used for the literature searching include emerging dbps ur dbps disinfection water distribution systems health risks toxicity water analysis water quality chlorination drinking water treatment and water treatment plants among the selected literature approximately 70 of articles were published in elsevier s journal database and in elsevier s database 80 of articles are from water research chemosphere and science of total environment in total nine ur dbp groups and 36 different ur dbps species were identified for further review and prioritization 2 1 identified unregulated disinfection by products groups 2 1 1 haloacetonitriles haloacetonitriles hans in general are produced by chlorination chloramination and using chlorine dioxide as disinfectants in drinking water treatment muellner et al 2007 however use of chloramines has made the levels of hans more prominent in drinking water although hans have yet to be regulated they have been frequently reported in many studies farr et al 2012 muellner et al 2007 yu and reckhow 2015 shanks et al 2013 some species of hans are determined to be toxic muellner et al 2007 in addition increased concentrations of hans were observed in dwdss as a result of decreasing ph and increasing temperature conditions who 2011 hans form rapidly but decompose slowly in dwdss due to hydrolysis who 2011 according to the data collected for this review the concentration level of hans in drinking water ranged between 0 6 and 24 Î¼g l dichloroacetonitrile dcan is by far the most prominent species among hans detected in drinking waters who 2011 2 1 2 halonitromethanes there are nine species of halonitromethanes hnms reported in the selected literature richardson et al 1999 among all hnms the most commonly occurring species include trichloronitromethane tcnm dichloronitromethane dcnm and bromochloronitromethane bcnm tcnm is the mostly commonly detected hnm thompson et al 2015 it has been reported that the concentrations of hnms increase because of the use of pre ozonation before chlorine or chloramine treatment krasner et al 2006 based on the collected data for this review the concentration level of hnms is in between 0 16 and 1 50 Î¼g l 2 1 3 haloketones haloketones hks are considered as a volatile ur dbps group nikolaou et al 2001 and there are six species of hks identified in dwdss among these species trichloropropanone tcp and dichloropropanone dcp are the most commonly occurring hks farr et al 2012 in general hk concentrations vary throughout dwdss due to base catalyzed hydrolysis reactions and they are not stable in high ph 7 environments due to hydrolytic decomposition nikolaou et al 2001 andrzejewski et al 2003 although hks have been found to be carcinogenic and mutagenic there is no threshold or guideline value developed for hks in drinking water nikolaou et al 2001 the concentration level of hks generally falls within the range of 1 23 8 6 Î¼g l according to the data collected for this review 2 1 4 haloacetamides haloacetamides hams are another ur dbp group that has been identified in both dwds and laboratory studies at the species level limited information related to the toxicity of hams is known chu et al 2013 roughly 13 species of hams have been identified so far farr et al 2012 and the commonly found species are dibromoacetamide dbacam dichloroacetamide dcacam and trichloroacetamide tcacam hams can be formed in dwdss as a result of chloramination and ozonation without biofiltration during which hans are hydrolysed to hams farr et al 2012 the concentration level of hams was identified to be within a range of 1 50 7 Î¼g l 2 1 5 aldehydes aldehydes als is another important ur dbps group in this review als are categorized into two sub groups including halogenated als hals and non halogenated als nhals both groups are assessed separately according to the established criteria hals are an important class of ur dbps and considered as the third largest dbp class by weight according to a us nationwide dbp occurrence study postigo et al 2015 there are 10 species of hals that have been identified for this review jeong et al 2015 trichloroacetaldehyde tcal and dichloroacetaldehyde dcal are the most commonly occurring species of hals jeong et al 2015 there are some established threshold limit values for tcal as shown in table 5 in general dihalogenated species of hals are prone to be formed with the presence of chloramines and ozone the possible mechanism is that ozonation can increase the formation of low molecular weight oxygen containing organic by products such as aldehydes which can lead to the formation of hals agbaba et al 2016 trihalogenated species of hals occur more frequently when using chlorine instead of chloramine farr et al 2012 the other sub group nhals includes formaldehyde fal and acetaldehyde aal the formation of nhals is due to the combined use of chlorine and other oxidants for water disinfection in general the occurrence and formation mechanism of nhals are similar with different types of disinfectants reemtsma and jekel 2006 the threshold values of fal have been established in some states in the us as shown in table 5 despite a significant health risk the adverse health effects of aldehydes are still poorly understood as only a few species of aldehydes have established toxicity values lopachin and gavin 2014 2 1 6 n nitrosamines n nitrosamines nas are commonly detected in water samples from pools wastewater groundwater and drinking water kadmi et al 2015 the formation of nas in general is due to the reaction of monochloramine and organic amine precursors under typical chloramination condition krasner et al 2013 in addition the chlorination of nitrite in the presence of nitrosamine precursor also forms nas krasner et al 2013 there are eight species of commonly occurring nas according to the reported studies n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is the most recognized species of this group nawrocki and andrzejewski 2011 the ndma formation in drinking water is reported to have a link with ozonation the concentration levels of nas in drinking water are often reported in ng l which is relatively low as compared to other ur dbp groups in spite of low concentration levels nas are considered as toxic chen et al 2016 as many na species are listed in the contaminant candidate list 4 ccl 4 established by usepa the ccl 4 includes those contaminants which are not part of any drinking water regulations but are known to occur in dwdss usepa 2016 the concentration level of nas according to the data collected for this literature review ranged in between 10 and 90 ng l 0 01 0 09 Î¼g l 2 1 7 iodinated dbps iodinated dbps i dbps are another emerging group of ur dbps the concentration levels reported for i dbps in drinking water are either in ng l or low Î¼g l in general i dbps can be found in drinking water that is treated by chlorine chloramine and ozone in the presence of iodide in addition the water from coastal areas subject to salt water intrusion can increase the formation of i dbps richardson et al 2008 i dbps include species of iodo acids and iodo thms according to previous literature there are 5 species of iodo acids and 6 species of iodo thms that have been identified the commonly occurring ones include iodoacetic acid iaa and iodoform if farr et al 2012 according to data collected for this literature review the concentration level of i dbps ranged between 0 54 and 0 9 Î¼g l 2 1 8 cyanides in cyanides cnx group there is only one species i e cyanogen chloride cncl which is considered as the commonly occurring ur dbp cncl is formed due to the chloramination or chlorination of water who 2011 cncl has been found in finished drinking water usually at the concentration level below 10 Î¼g l who 2011 in addition high concentration levels of cncl were reported as a result of using chloramination as compared to chlorination cncl has acute toxic effects i e skin and eyes irritation dizziness and shortness of breath through oral inhalation and dermal exposure pathways however the related chronic effects on human health are not well defined yet na and olson 2004 the average concentration level of cncl in dwdss was found to be 4 Î¼g l goslan et al 2014 2 2 concentration levels and reported frequency the concentration levels and reported frequencies of commonly occurring ur dbp species are summarized in table 2 in many studies the concentration of an individual ur dbp species was reported more than one time in that case an average value was taken to make the concentration levels more representative moreover the reported frequencies of different ur dbp species in the selected articles were recorded as an indicator of the relative importance a higher reported frequency of ur dbps species represents a higher occurrence of the species in dwdss reflecting a higher relative importance the concentration levels and reported frequencies were converted into scores shown in section 3 1 and 3 2 which were used for prioritization of ur dbps species 2 3 toxicological properties toxicological properties are defined as hazard endpoints by which we can measure or asses the adverse effects of substance or chemicals on human health klaassen and watkins iii 2015 in general ur dbps are considered more toxic to human health as compared to r dbps richardson et al 2007 some species of nitrogenous ur dbps and iodinated ur dbps are considered as 2 and 250 times more toxic than the r dbps respectively wrf 2017 kimura et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 table 3 shows the toxicological properties of selected ur dbps species as shown in table 3 acute toxicity oral and inhalation mutagenicity carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were selected to define toxicological endpoints the selection of these hazards endpoints was based on the following facts 1 oral exposure route is generally considered as the most common exposure route of intake for ur dbps wang et al 2007 richardson et al 2007 2 inhalation is another important exposure route and risk contributor wang et al 2007 particularly in showering in some cases inhalation pathway can be the most critical dbp exposure route basu et al 2011 3 mutagenicity refers to a permanent change in genetic material of a cell or organism mutagenicity of ur dbps was selected to estimate the heritable damages such as growth and development damages i e low birth weight congenital malformations behavioral defects delayed appearance of early postnatal landmarks and growth retardation to the offspring of parents exposed to the mutagens trasler and doerksen 1999 gruiz et al 2015 4 carcinogenicity is another important toxicological endpoint for ur dbps as various epidemiological investigations linked cancer occurrence to chlorinated drinking water villanueva et al 2003 stewart and wild 2014 in addition there are still ongoing studies investigating the relation between dbps and cancer villanueva et al 2015 particularly with a focus on identifying the relationship between the ur dbps exposure and various cancer risks villanueva et al 2015 5 a large number of dbps are considered to be cytotoxic and genotoxic chinese hamster ovary cho cells are widely used in toxicology to assess the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity potency of dbps wagner and plewa 2017 quantitative cytotoxicity and genotoxicity data derived from the toxicity assays on the cho cells is available for more than 100 dbps the information on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity is helpful to the dbp researchers when comparing the measured dbps concentration by the metrics of toxic potency li and mitch 2018 inclusion of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity endpoints can generate more comprehensive toxicity profiles of commonly occurring ur dbps 2 4 physiochemical properties physiochemical properties are important in terms of assessing the behavior of ur dbps chiou et al 1977 these properties can help to describe the fate and transport modelling in environmental risk assessment in addition they have a strong impact on the exposure mechanism of ur dbps wolf and schwenk 2014 for example oral ingestion is the most common route of exposure which depends on the bioavailability and environmental fate of substance bioavailability largely depends on the water solubility of the substance and thus it is linked with oral ingestion savjani et al 2012 the partition coefficient kow can be used as a screening test to identify the ur dbp species with a significant bioaccumulation potential jorgensen and johnsen 2011 similarly the vapour pressure is important to asses the ur dbp exposure higher vapour pressures generally result in faster evaporation rates transport canada 2009 the henry s law constant can be used to asses the volatility of species as it is the measure of chemical partition between air and water at equilibrium jayjock et al 2000 in addition the effects of water solubility on genotoxicity have also been observed in previous studies christie 2007 table 4 lists some common physicochemical properties of ur dbps species 2 5 established guidelines and threshold levels the difference between a guideline and a standard is that a guideline is non enforceable and when a guideline is enforced it becomes a standard dunn et al 2014 bc 2017 although for ur dbps there is no standard issued by the usepa however developing threshold levels for these species is necessary and considered as a shared responsibility which requires contributions from various stakeholders at municipal provincial and federal levels health canada 2015 drinking water authorities need to include ur dbps in water quality benchmarking to better monitor and evaluate system performance hence many states have devised their own threshold values for some ur dbp species similarly many organizations have also set some guideline values for various ur dbp species including the usepa the available threshold level and guideline for ur dbps species set by different states and organizations are shown in table 5 echa 2018 nhmrc 2011 ministry of health people s republic of china 2006 the water supply water quality regulations 2000 ministry of health 2008 ministry of health labour and welfare 2004 usepa 2017b state water resources control board california 2017 ontario regulation 2017 who 2011 kadmi et al 2015 some of the ur dbps in table 5 are included in drinking water standards in some countries however in the majority of cases there are only guideline values are available for these ur dbps in some cases where the ur dbps are part of drinking water standards they still come under non regular indices which mean they are applicable in special regions times and cases ministry of health people s republic of china 2006 according to the safe drinking water act implemented by the usepa they can still be referred to as ur dbps it can be seen in table 5 that guidelines and threshold levels have been developed for some species of hans als and nas by many organizations and states indicating that these ur dbps group have gained relative more importance in terms of their occurrence however there are still no guidelines or threshold values for other commonly occurring ur dbps groups i e hks hnms and hams 3 proposed prioritization method the purpose of prioritization is to evaluate ur dbps species based on the defined criteria i e concentration levels reported frequency and toxicity this will identify important ur dbps species that need to be addressed in terms of setting up threshold limits improving the monitoring in dwdss i e to gather further data on their variability and reducing their exposure by applying various controlling strategies in water treatment after this prioritization ur dbps species can be divide into three categories namely critical priority medium priority and low priority the critical priority category includes those species that are important in terms of setting up guidelines or applying water quality controls the medium priority category is required to be addressed after the critical priority category the low priority category includes those species that are either not important based on current available information or require further investigation fig 2 shows the proposed prioritization method used to categorize ur dbps species ranking of different ur dbp groups and species can be done using an indexing system as shown in fig 2 n groups are considered a b and n as an example and each group can have different numbers of species the scores of individual ur dbp species are calculated and aggregated to generate a group score hence the prioritization of groups is not only dependent on individual species scores but also on the number of species present in different groups this prioritization method can be applied to any number of ur dbp groups and species the indexing system is a cost effective and less time consuming process for generating a simple measurement from multi dimensional information which has gained widespread acceptance in system performance benchmarking bonin and stevenson 2013 rosenblum and lapp 1989 hu et al 2018 in this study the species score is calculated as 1 species score concentration level reported frequency toxicity it can be seen from eq 1 that a species score is calculated based on three criteria including concentration level reported frequency and toxicity the criteria were selected because they are relevant to the human health risks caused by ur dbp exposure asante duah 2017 to quantify the human health risk it is important to know the toxicity and exposure of ur dbps toxicity is referred to potential adverse effects and levels at which ur dbps have an impact on human health the exposure assessment describes the magnitude frequency and duration for human being exposed to ur dbps usepa 2012 the three mentioned criteria cover aspects related to human health exposure risk assessment for example the concentration levels and reported frequency can collectively describe the extent and frequency of ur dbps exposure this can be combined with the toxicity of ur dbps to measure the overall impact of ur dbps if a species has a high concentration level but low reported frequency and toxicity then it will not be rated as highly important due to low occurrence and low human health hazard if a species has a high toxicity but very low concentration level and reported frequency it will also not be considered important however if a species has a medium to high concentration level toxicity and reported frequency then it will be considered as important the following sections give the details of criteria used for the species score calculation 3 1 concentration levels the concentration levels of different ur dbps species in dwdss vary significantly table 2 in order to develop the scores for different concentration levels a cumulative distribution function cdf was applied smeets 2010 the concentration levels are distributed along the percentiles and scores are assigned to percentile values chen and kultgen 2016 high concentration levels are associated with high percentile values accordingly scores are assigned from 1 to 10 with a high score value representing a high concentration level and vice versa to develop a cdf a statistical software minitab 18 was used and the following steps are considered 1 identify the applicable cdf curve for the given data 2 assign scores by plotting the percentiles of the concentration levels the selection of a specific cdf distribution among various applicable distributions is based on two parameters i e the anderson darling ad statistic and p values the concentration levels of all ur dbps followed the gamma distribution pattern the percentile values developed are used further to develop the concentration level scores the concentration scores corresponding to different percentile values are shown in table 6 based on the scores the species are prioritized using a qualitative scale if concentration level is 90th percentile of data then it is a high priority score 10 if concentration level is 90th percentile of the data but 50th percentile then it is a moderate priority score 5 7 if concentration level is 50th percentile of the data but is 20th percentile then it is a low priority score 2 3 and if concentration level 20th percentile of the data then it is a very low priority score 2 3 2 reported frequency reported frequency data was collected by calculating the number of times that a particular ur dbp species has been reported in selected peer reviewed articles the concept of cdf was also applied for reported frequency data in a similar way as mentioned for concentration level data this data matches the log normal distribution the developed scoring criteria for reported frequency is shown in table 6 based on the scores species are prioritized using a qualitative scale which includes if reported frequency is 90th percentile of data then it is a high priority score 10 if reported frequency is 90th percentile of the data but is 70th percentile then it is a moderate priority score 6 if reported frequency is 70th percentile of the data but is 30th percentile then it is a low priority score 2 4 and if reported frequency 30th percentile of the data then it is a very low priority score 2 3 3 toxicity in toxicity the endpoints for acute toxicity e g oral and inhalation and mutagenicity were developed using the globally harmonized system of classification and labelling of chemical ghs guidelines un 2013 for carcinogenicity the international agency for research on cancer iarc classification bouvard et al 2009 was used these endpoints are used internationally for chemical toxicity communication cytotoxicity and genotoxicity endpoints were also considered for a more comprehensive overall toxicity evaluation the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity data available for different ur dbps were collected from various published literature the scoring criteria for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity was developed using the lowest toxic concentration values and cdf table 6 shows the scoring criteria for all considered toxicity endpoints as shown in table 6 a high score value represents a high toxicity and vice versa in addition the endpoint of acute toxicity through inhalation is shown in both ppm vol and mg l as mentioned in the ghs classification system un 2013 the inhalation toxicity unit is a function of the form of the inhaled material and the reported values for inhalation are either in mg m3 or in ppm vol hence two classification endpoints are used that include gas mg m3 and mist ppm vol un 2013 if inhalation toxicity value is reported in both mg m3 and ppm vol then the most conservative value will be selected in addition the final acute toxicity score is calculated as the most conservative value higher score among the individual oral and inhalation toxicity scores the overall toxicity is evaluated as a combination of acute toxicity mutagenicity carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity hence the overall toxicity score is generated by aggregating the scores of the five toxicity endpoints selected desesso and john 1987 as shown in eq 2 2 toxicity i 1 5 toxicity type where 1 is acute toxicity 2 is mutagenicity 3 is carcinogenicity 4 is cytotoxicity and 5 is genotoxicity all hazard endpoints including acute toxicity i e oral and inhalation mutagenicity carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity are considered as equally important in the calculation of total toxicity score carcinogenicity is the ability to cause cancer and mutagenicity is the ability to change the genetic material which may cause abnormalities and disease both carcinogenicity and mutagenicity are irreversible adverse human health effects health canada 2008 similarly acute toxicity represents the dose that will cause mortality and other serious toxicological effects haschek and rousseaux 2013 acute toxicity can be helpful in setting up hazard classification and providing information for the comparison of toxicity and dose response relationship among various species of ur dbps hodgson 2004 moreover cytotoxicity assesses the health effects of ur dbps in terms of altering cell morphology and cell growth mcgaw et al 2014 genotoxicity assesses the destructive effects of ur dbps on cells genetic material e g dna rna shah 2012 based on the overall toxicity scores the species are prioritized in terms of adverse human health effects using a qualitative toxicity classification scale as shown in table 7 in section 4 the scale was also developed using the cdf on the calculated overall toxicity scores 3 4 species scores the calculated species scores using eq 1 were normalized into a scale between 0 and 1 the species scores were converted to a scale of 0 100 using a scale up coefficient where 0 represents the minimum score and 100 represents the maximum score the purpose of normalization is to make results easy to understand by avoiding the comparison of the quantities measured in different units perini et al 2006 han et al 2011 there are various methods for data normalization among these methods dividing the data by the largest value is a commonly used normalization method using this method each value can be expressed as a percentage of the largest observed value and a linear transformation on the original data can be achieved tofallis 2014 coulter et al 2006 eq 3 shows the formula used for the normalization of species scores 3 normalized score x x m a x 100 where x actual species score x max the maximum value among all actual species scores and the scale up coefficient is 100 based on the species scores ur dbps are grouped into critical medium and low priority categories the scores of species under the same ur dbps group are aggregated to generate a score for the group 4 results the prioritization method along with criteria and developed endpoints were applied on the selected commonly occurring ur dbps species the scores with respect to the three criteria i e concentration level reported frequency and toxicity were calculated in addition criteria scores were combined using eq 1 to obtain species scores which were further used to calculate the group scores fig 3 shows the scores of ur dbps species measured on the three criteria in addition priority levels of species have been defined using a qualitative scale fig 3 a shows that tcp dcan and some species of hals and nhals have high concentration scores as their concentration levels lie above the 90th percentile value according to scale developed for concentration level table 6 all selected species of nas excluding ndma are associated with low concentration scores as their concentration levels were below the 20th percentile of the given data according to fig 3 b the maximum score was given to those species having the reported frequency above the 90th percentile according to the scale for reporting frequency shown in table 6 the species with high reported frequency scores include ndma dcan tcnm and bromochloracetonitrile bcan the lowest score was given to those species having reported frequency values lower than the 30th percentile value of the collected frequency data the ur dbps species with low reported frequency scores are if n nitrosopiperidine npip n nitrosodipropylamine ndpa bromoacetonitrile mban dcnm iaa and all species of hals except tcal fig 3 c shows that species of nas including n nitrosomorpholine nmor and npip along with tcal have the highest overall toxicity scores both nmor and npip are possible carcinogenic to humans and have a moderate acute toxicity whereas tcal is probable carcinogenic and has a high acute toxicity us national library of medicine 2017a in addition nmor and npip have high mutagenicity and genotoxicity whereas tcal has high mutagenicity and moderate cytotoxicity table 7 shows a qualitative priority scale along with percentiles of overall toxicity scores according to table 7 a high priority level was given to species with a toxicity score of 29 or greater i e 90th percentile value of the data a moderate priority level was given to species having a score in the range of 21 28 i e 90th percentile but 60th percentile value of the data a low priority level was given to species having scores in the range between 13 and 20 i e 60th percentile but 20th percentile value of the data very low priority was given to those species having scores less than 13 i e 20th percentile value of the data some species of hals and one species of hams i e dibromoacetamide dbacam were given very low scores owing to their relatively low overall toxicity moreover it is noteworthy that many data gaps were identified for the species of hals and hams for example data gaps for the species of hals except cal and tcal in terms of acute toxicity mutagenicity and carcinogenicity have increased the uncertainty in the overall toxicity assessment results 4 1 species score fig 4 shows the overall species scores calculated for all selected ur dbps species the scaled scores of ur dbps were categorised into three priority levels i e critical medium and low priority the cut off values for prioritizing ur dbps species were identified based on the calculated species scores and the authors judgement the following criteria were developed if the species score was 70 then the ur dbp species was classified into the critical category if the species score was 70 but 20 then it came under the medium priority category species with a score 20 came under the low priority following the developed criteria dcan and tcal comes under the critical category with the scores of 100 and 71 respectively species with the score ranged between 21 and 54 including tcnm fal tcp dban dcp aal bcan and ndma were grouped into the medium priority category the species having lower scores than ndma score 21 came under the low priority category such as all species of hams i dbps and cnx and some species of hals nas hans and hnms the scaled scores of species within the same ur dbp group were aggregated to generate a group score as mentioned in section 3 4 table 8 shows the aggregated ur dbps group scores as can be seen hans have the highest group score among all selected groups due to the high scores of its species i e dcan bcan and dban similarly hals comes second after hans with tcal as a dominant species nhals comes after hals with fal and aal made up the total group score combining the group scores of hals and nhals makes als almost equally important as hans i e hals group score 169 and hans group score 172 the hks group comes after the nhals but the difference in group scores between nhals and hks was not much hnms come after hks and followed by nas the group score of hnms is determined by three identified species among which tcnm is the most prominent one for nas the group score was aggregated from the species scores of eight species with ndma being the most prominent one in addition hams cnx and i dbps have relatively low group scores either due to a low number of species or low relative importance of species determined using the developed prioritization method 5 discussion based on the results the ur dbps within the three priority categories are discussed along with the implications of this prioritization 5 1 critical priority dcan with high concentration levels high reported frequency and moderate toxicity has been given the highest scaled species score and is classified into the critical priority category hans is one of the main nitrogenous dbp groups identified and within this group dcan has a major contribution in terms of concentration levels tan et al 2017 who 2011 previous canadian surveys showed that the reported frequency of dcan in all water samples was around 97 williams et al 1997 in south korea the concentration level of dcan in drinking water has been reported to be around 40 Î¼g l shin et al 2013 which is nearly two times higher than the value given in the provisional guidelines for dcan by who who 2011 in the usa concentrations higher than 20 Î¼g l have been recorded for dcan in dwdss similarly tcal with relatively high concentration moderate reported frequency and high toxicity has been classified as having a critical priority after dcan tcal is a part of hals an important ur dbp group postigo et al 2015 tcal is the most extensively investigated hal in drinking water and contributes to almost 60 of the total hals jeong et al 2015 in the united states the maximum concentration of tcal was found to be around 46 Î¼g l whereas in canadian dwdss the concentration has been recorded up to 263 Î¼g l in water treated by ozone and chlorine jeong et al 2015 5 2 medium priority fal and aal were classified into the medium priority category due to their high concentration level low reported frequency and low to high toxicity fal scored the highest group score within the medium priority category according to the developed indexing method however both fal and aal are dominant nhals in water as they are identified with carcinogenic and mutagenic effects lugwisha et al 2016 some previous studies have concluded that fal is more toxic than aal til et al 1988 in addition to the high human health toxicity these aldehydes may cause changes to water taste and color lugwisha et al 2016 tcp and dcp come under the medium priority category due to their moderate to high concentration level moderate reported frequency and low toxicity as mentioned tcp and dcp are considered as the main species in hks group nikolaou et al 2001 in addition it has been observed that concentration levels of tcp and dcp vary in dwdss mainly due to the oxidation of dcp into tcp in the presence of free chlorine guilherme and rodriguez 2015 hence it is important to study their concentrations at different points in dwdss in order to understand their behavior to minimize the exposure bcan and dban are species of the hans group these species were classified in the medium priority category due to their moderate concentration level moderate to high reported frequency and low to moderate toxicity previous studies showed that dban has been identified as carcinogenic based on animal test results templeton et al 2010 hence it has been rated high on the toxicity scale in comparison bcan is considered as moderately toxic templeton et al 2010 among hans the concentration levels of bcan and dban are low as compared to dcan concentration level in dwdss hara 2013 considering the species of hnms the most common and prominent species is tcnm goslan et al 2014 it is classified into the medium priority category due to its moderate concentration level high reported frequency and high toxicity the tcnm is the first species among hnms that was identified in drinking water le roux et al 2011 however the toxicological data of tcnm is still inadequate to develop guideline values who 2011 the tcnm concentrations on average were reported to be around 0 6 Î¼g l and the maximum concentration can be as high as 5 6 Î¼g l who 2011 among nas the only species that comes under medium priority category is ndma which is due to its moderate toxicity high reported frequency and low concentration level ndma has become a significant health concern in drinking water supply due to their high carcinogenic potency liew et al 2016 in addition the occurrence of ndma has been reported more frequently as compared to any other species of nas liew et al 2016 previous studies showed that ndma concentration levels in chlorinated or chloraminated drinking water are generally less than 10 ng l 0 01 Î¼g l however with longer residence time the concentration levels are reported to be 100 ng l 0 10 Î¼g l charrois et al 2007 5 3 low priority using the developed prioritization method 26 out of 36 species were grouped into the low priority category among these 26 species dcacam and cncl are the top two important species of this category both dcacam and cncl have moderate concentration levels low reported frequency and low to moderate toxicity in addition some species in the low priority category have still no established toxicity values and there is a need to fill the toxicological data gaps for these species apart from the identified ur dbps in this study several unregulated brominated haas have also been identified in drinking waters there has been an increasing concern over these unregulated brominate haas in the past particularly in source water with a high bromide concentration however according to the data collected for this study there was not much information available for unregulated brominated haas the data gaps for unregulated brominated haas species were also reported by samson et al 2017 several modelling techniques have been used to estimate the concentrations of unregulated brominated haas samson et al 2017 also the usepa has proposed the fourth unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr 4 specifically targeting at brominated haas usepa 2018 based on this rule brominated haas will be monitored in public water systems in the next coming years to assess their occurrence for future decision making it is expected that more monitoring data will be generated in the near future for these unregulated brominated haas 6 implication of prioritization in recent years research is taking a new direction towards the better understanding of ur dbps occurrence and behaviors this study grouped the recently studied ur dbps species into critical medium and low priority categories the species within the critical priority category can be studied further in terms of their kinetics to understand the formation mechanisms and epidemiological impacts in addition the regulatory authorities water utilities and scientific communities can use the results of this prioritization for different purposes 1 water regulators can identify the ur dbps species that are under critical priority category and possibly have a maximum exposure to the public hence this review on a preliminary basis can provide the list of critical ur dbps species which needs to be considered in developing guidelines or threshold limits 2 the results of the prioritization can help the scientific community in the selection of important ur dbp groups and species to carry out further in depth studies in general regulations and research can be the drivers of each other hence comprehensive studies on occurrence and toxicity of ur dbps are necessary these studies can include the understanding of ur dbps formation mechanisms and the results can potentially facilitate the water regulators in developing or setting threshold limits 3 water utilities can use the prioritization results in selection of disinfection alternatives and developing water quality management plans in nutshell water utilities can use the prioritization as a reference to identify the important ur dbp species which need to be controlled in the system to deliver safe drinking water this prioritization can also help water utilities in allocating resources to monitor the occurrence of most critical ur dbp species for example if an ur dbp species is highly toxic to human health but its concentration level and reported frequency are low then this species might not be considered a high priority from the water utilities perspective in terms of applying water quality control on the other hand if a species is associated with moderate toxicity but the concentration level and reported frequency is high then it can be a priority for water utilities as there is a higher chance of exposure hebert et al 2010 has also prioritized ur dbps based on available published data before 2010 the selection criteria used to evaluate the priority was different from the criteria used in this review in addition the indexing methods were different hebert et al 2010 used toxicity as a criterion covering mutagenicity genotoxicity and carcinogenicity whereas this review covers toxicity more comprehensively including acute toxicity mutagenicity carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity hebert et al 2010 considered occurrence as a combination of detection frequency and concentration and then aggregated the occurrence score with toxicity and regulation or classification scores this review considered the concentration level and the reported frequency of ur dbps species separately in addition this review did not consider the developed guidelines or threshold values of ur dbps in prioritization species which were categorized as having a low priority by hebert et al 2010 are also considered as low priority according to criteria of this review including some species of hams hals hnms and i dbps however there are some species such as tcp dcp and dcan were rated as having a low priority according to hebert et al 2010 but they have moderate to critical priority according to this review in addition the species of nhals i e fal and aal were considered to have high priorities according to hebert et al 2010 but in this review they are considered to have a medium priority the possible reason for this difference is that several spatial and temporal studies on ur dbp species have been carried out in recent years which leads to more available data for ur dbps prioritization the results for species of nas reported by hebert et al 2010 were slightly different from the results of this review however ndma is considered the most prominent species among nas in both hebert et al 2010 and this review there are some other studies published in recent years evaluating the formation of dbps i e both r dbps and ur dbps these studies characterized and quantified different r dbps and ur dbps generated from different wastewater treatment strategies and coastal groundwater zeng et al 2016 szczuka et al 2017 chuang and mitch 2017 these studies also incorporated the factor of toxicity along with concentration levels to evaluate the relative importance of the dbps i e both r dbps and ur dbps zeng et al 2016 szczuka et al 2017 chuang and mitch 2017 for example zeng et al 2016 and chuang and mitch 2017 studied the formation of r dbps and ur dbps in wastewater more particularly considering different wastewater treatment trains both studies evaluated the effects of various wastewater treatment technologies to evaluate the concentration of dbps which were further weighted by incorporating the factors of toxicities the concentration of dbps in wastewater is generally different from that in drinking water primarily due to difference in nom concentration also known as effluent organic matter in the case of wastewater wert et al 2007 the study by szczuka et al 2017 investigated ur dbp formation from saline groundwater these studies have also provided information of dbps i e r dbps and ur dbps in terms their concentration levels and toxicity in coastal groundwater in addition the dbps were also assessed by applying certain water treatment and elevating the bromide concentration in coastal groundwater in comparison this critical review comprehensively prioritized various ur dbps in water treatment plants and dwdss not only by considering concentration levels and toxicity but also taking the reported frequency into consideration the reported frequency can address the importance of ur dbps species at a very broad level this gives the readers a holistic picture of those ur dbps which are being investigated or require more attention the information presented in this critical review is not limited to one study or situation in fact it evaluates ur dbps based on data collected from studies occurring in different parts of the world additionally the above mentioned studies used cytotoxicity as an endpoint to assess the toxicity of ur dbps however in this critical review the toxicity of ur dbps was evaluated by combining five toxicological endpoints including acute toxicity mutagenicity carcinogenicity cytotoxicity and genotoxicity the information generated from this critical review will enable water managers and regulators to understand the broader picture of ur dbps their occurrence and their possible impacts on human health 7 conclusions and recommendations ur dbps are receiving increasing attention from the scientific community and water regulators due to their high toxicity as compared to r dbps in addition ur dbp concentration levels are detectable in dwdss owing to the advancement in analytical techniques and the increase in the use of alternative disinfectants this review article not only listed the ur dbps reported in recent literature but also prioritized them into three categories i e critical medium and low priorities based on three criteria including concentration level reported frequency and toxicity the results show that ur dbp species according to the measured species scores can be ranked in a descending order as dcan tcal tcnm fal tcp dban dcp aal bcan ndma the rank can help drinking water stakeholders to identify the critical ur dbps species it can also serve as a reference in various epidemiological risk assessment and kinetics based studies to better assess human health risks due to exposure to harmful ur dbps it is recommended to have more field investigations on ur dbps identified as critical to obtain more information for preventing their formation in dwdss it is also important to investigate the formation mechanisms for these selected ur dbps which could facilitate water regulators in proposing suitable water treatment strategies or technologies to control ur dbp formation there are many emerging water treatment technologies available to minimize ur dbps formation particularly in terms of removing nom from drinking water these include coagulation based systems dissolved air flotation direct filtration and oxidation and membrane based systems 8 study limitations the species scores calculated are based on the selected criteria and the selection of criteria is a subjective process different scores will be generated for the same ur dbps based on different sets of evaluation criteria in addition the toxicity data for some ur dbps species i e species of hams hnms and hals was not available increasing the uncertainty in prioritization these mentioned species fall within the low priority category based on the developed scoring criteria a comprehensive research on exposure and toxicity of these ur dbps within the low priority category is required this will further help to accurately measure the health risks to the public and better management solutions could be devised the ur dbps groups scores are based on the aggregated scores of species and in this review only those species which are commonly reported in the published articles are considered hence the score of a group is not completely representative of all the species within the group there might be many ur dbp species that are not measured or identified in dwdss and there is also a possibility that some ur dbps were identified but receive less research interest hence with more efforts to understand the occurrence of these ur dbps in dwdss might change the priority order of ur dbps identified in this study it is also expected that many other ur dbps which are not listed in this study will be discovered in the coming years acknowledgements the authors would like to thank natural sciences and engineering research council of canada for

19228,increasing attention has been dedicated to trace phthalates in bottled water due to the serious concerns on public health while there is still a lack of systematic analysis and assessment of current global situation through analyzing five representative phthalates in bottled water over 20 countries this work clearly revealed the phthalates associated potential risks in both human daily intake and estrogenic effect in the risk assessment the kinetic models were also developed to describe and predict phthalates migration in more than three hundred brands of bottled waters from twenty one countries the detection frequency of the five targeted phthalates was found to be in the order of dibutyl phthalate dbp 67 6 di 2 ethyl hexyl phthalate dehp 61 7 diethyl phthalate dep 47 1 benzyl butyl phthalate bbp 36 9 and dimethyl phthalate dmp 30 1 among the countries studied relating concentrations of dehp in bottled waters the top five countries ranked in the order of high to low were thailand croatia czech republic saudi arabia and china with an average level of 61 1 8 8 6 3 6 2 and 6 1 Î¼g l respectively the average levels of bbp dbp dmp and dep in bottled water from pakistan were high in which dep and dmp were ranked 1st among all countries with the average levels of 22 4 and 50 2 Î¼g l while bbp and dbp were ranked 2nd and 3rd with the average levels of 7 5 and 17 8 Î¼g l respectively the human daily intake based risk assessment revealed that phthalates in bottled waters studied would not pose a serious concern on public health however the adverse estrogenic effects of phthalates in bottled water from some countries appeared to be significant this study just shed light on global situation of phthalates in bottled water and more efforts should be needed to systematically examine the phthalates related safety of bottled water graphical abstract image 1 keywords phthalates bottled water migration kinetics risk assessment daily intakes estrogenic effects 1

et al 2011 jones et al 2018 due to potential adverse effects of phthalates on public health many studies had examined the concentration levels of phthalates in bottled water together with the assessment of potential risks to human health bach et al 2012 santana et al 2014 jeddi et al 2015a 2016 meanwhile attention had also be dedicated to migration of phthalates from plastic bottles under different storage conditions bach et al 2013 diduch et al 2013 guart et al 2014a keresztes et al 2013 it is still not clear about global situation of phthalates in bottled waters worldwide devier et al 2013 santana et al 2014 zaater et al 2014 it should be realized that many studies had been conducted on a short term basis but most bottled water has at least one year quality warranty period these in turn indicate that long term monitoring of migration of phthalates is necessary but it is highly challenging in reality given such a situation mathematical model can provide a simple and effective option for predicting migration potential of phthalates during water storage therefore this study aimed to 1 provide phthalate levels in bottled waters produced from different countries 2 develop a kinetic model for migration of phthalates from plastic bottles to bottle water accompanied with a preliminary risk assessment on human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 target phthalates according to the reported detection frequency in bottled water five phthalates i e dehp bbp dbp dep and dmp were selected as the target compounds in this study and their physicochemical properties are presented in table 1 2 2 data sources the key words bottled water packaged water drinking water paes or phthalates were used to search for the relevant information on web of science scopus and scholar google over a period of 2000 2018 the total 59 publications from 21 countries were identified and used as the data sources for further analysis 2 3 migration kinetics of phthalates from plastic bottle to water the levels of phthalates in plastic bottled water had been commonly studied on a short term basis which is much shorter than the allowable quality guarantee period of at least one year to properly address such a challenge lacking long term monitoring data kinetic models describing the migration of phthalates from plastic bottle to water were developed in this study in which the effects of storage time and temperature were considered the data collected from the literature were fitted to different linear exponential and polynomial models as shown below 1 linear fit c a b t 2 exponential fit c a e x p b t 3 polynomial model fit c a b t c t 2 showing in equations 1 3 c is the phthalates concentration t is the storage time while a b and c are all fitting constants 2 4 calculating of country average concentration of phthalates in bottled water for convenience of comparison the average concentration of phthalates in bottled water in each country pa is calculated using the equation below 4 p a c i n i n i showing in equation 4 ci is the average concentration of phthalates in one study while ni is the corresponding sample size of bottled water with data summarized in table s1 profile of sample sizes of bottled water and average concentrations as well as concentration ranges of phthalates in bottled water is summarized in table s2 for bottled water without detection reported as not detected nd the corresponding phthalates concentration is taken as half of the limit of detection lod when the phthalates concentration in bottled water is above lod but below limit of quantification loq the calculating concentration is considered as half of the loq all related work in table s1 with reported phthalates concentrations were included in this study except for a work from thailand in which the reported concentrations of dehp dbp dep and dmp were nd 490 nd 330 nd and nd 530 Î¼g l respectively prapatpong and kanchanamayoon 2010 the reason to exclude this work is the extremely high lods of 25 50 Î¼g l in which the lods are one or more orders of magnitude higher than those of other studies to avoid miscalculation the investigated result in prapatpong and kanchanamayoon 2010 is not included 2 5 risk assessment 2 5 1 daily intake associated risk assessment human daily intake of phthalates through bottled water was calculated as follows 5 e i n c v w where ein c v and w are human daily intake of phthalates Î¼g kg bw d phthalates concentration in bottled water Î¼g l daily consumption of bottled water l d and human body weight kg the consumption of bottled water by adults and children are set to be 2 and 1 l per day respectively with the body weight of 70 kg for adults and 20 kg for children montuori et al 2008 huang et al 2017 2018 for human risk assessment the reported and predicted levels of phthalates were compared to the recommended values by u s fda 2012 and who 2011 by which the mcl maximum contaminant levels values are set to 6 and 8 Î¼g l respectively for the purpose of comparison the safety factor sf was also calculated as follows 6 s f r f d e i n where rfd is the reference dose given by regulations or guidelines epa 2009 sf below 1 indicates safety concern 2 5 2 estrogenic activity associated risk assessment as shown in table 1 some selected phthalates are estrogenic e g dehp bbp dbp and dep which are very weak estrogens in this study the concept of estrogen equivalence eeq was adopted for the purpose of comparison liu et al 2009 2010a b 7 e e q e p i c i where ep and c denote the estrogenic potency of an individual estrogenic phthalate and its corresponding concentration respectively ep of estrogenic compound is often determined by in vitro bioassays in which e2 with the strongest estrogenic activity among natural estrogens is often selected as the standard estrogenic compound i e the ep of e2 is arbitrarily set as 1 when the estrogenic activity of one compound is stronger than that of e2 its ep would above 1 otherwise the corresponding ep would below 1 therefore the unit of eeq is normally represented as ng e2 l 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and migration of phthalates in bottled water 3 1 1 potential sources of phthalates in bottled water trace residues of phthalates in bottled water may originate from different sources e g source water production process raw material of packaging and even background contamination in laboratory schmid et al 2008 sax 2010 bach et al 2012 guart et al 2014b szendi et al 2018 the investigation of 131 source waters in spain showed that all monitored phthalates including dmp dbp bbp dehp and dep were not detected except for a borehole source water close to an industrial area with a detected concentration of 1 12 Î¼g l dep bono blay et al 2012 contamination of phthalates may also come from production process but there is no quantitative study reported yet salazar beltran et al 2017 contamination of phthalates during sample preparation had also been reported and the main source was found to be air pollution to the syringe needle and such contamination indeed could be avoided by quick injection at the temperature below 40 c frankhause noti and grob 2007 marega et al 2013 with the analytical methods checked with linearity of calibration curves recovery sensitivity repeatability reproducibility and blank control false reports due to outer contamination during sample preparation are unlikely significant haned et al 2018 gonezalez salamo et al 2018 on the other hand the considerable contents of phthalates were found in plastic bottles e g the detected levels of dbp and dehp in plastic bottle were in the range of 21 72 and 393 1499 mg kg respectively otero et al 2015 while the detected levels of dbp dep and dmp were reported to be up to 63 5 3 1 and 14 8 mg kg respectively salazar beltran et al 2018 therefore it is reasonable to consider that the main source of phthalates in bottled water likely originated from plastic bottle instead of the other sources wu et al 2014 rastkari et al 2017 zaki and shoeib 2018 the regulations on phthalates have been established for food related plastic packaging material in which dehp dbp and bbp are limited to be 1 5 0 3 and 30 mg kg respectively eu 2015 consequently plastic bottle should be the main source of phthalates found in bottled water in addition trace phthalates were also detected in some glass bottled water which suggested that bottle cap is also a potential source leivadara et al 2008 prokupkova et al 2002 3 1 2 migration of phthalates from plastic bottle to water several factors may influence the migration of phthalates from plastic bottle to water e g storage conditions i e temperature time sunlight intensity ph bottle size etc as seen in table s3 the migration of phthalates in bottled water indeed resulted from the combined effects of multiple factors in general high temperature favors accelerate the migration zaater et al 2014 jeddi et al 2016 pourzamani et al 2017 while storage time was found to be positively correlated to the migration of phthalates from plastic bottle to water criado et al 2005 keresztes et al 2013 guart et al 2014b jeddi et al 2016 cincotta et al 2018 in addition the intensity of sunlight may also play an important role during migration because it may affect the degradation degree of phthalates lertsirisopon et al 2009 similarly ph also contributed to the observed migration of phthalates in bottled water with the contradictory results reported in the literature bosnir et al 2007 and martine et al 2013 found that acidic condition promoted the diffusion of phthalates on the contrary the majority of studies seemed to suggest that the higher ph is favorable for the migration of phthalates from plastic bottle biscardi et al 2003 montuori et al 2008 keresztes et al 2013 martine et al 2013 rastkari et al 2017 in addition there is no concrete evidence showing the effect of bottle size or more importantly the surface to volume ratio on the migration of phthalates e g positive or no correlation between them had been reported montuori et al 2008 keresztes et al 2013 3 1 3 a global picture of trace residues of phthalates in bottled water the trace residues of phthalates had been reported in bottled water of over three hundreds brands worldwide table s3 the detection frequency of the five selected phthalates in all the brands of the bottled water was in the order of dbp 67 6 dehp 61 7 dep 47 1 bbp 36 9 and dmp 30 1 the highest concentrations of dehp bbp dbp dep and dmp in all the bottled waters studied were found to be 94 1 109 0 222 0 34 2 and 61 3 Î¼g l respectively according to the recommendations of who 2011 and u s fda 2012 for dehp i e 8 and 6 Î¼g l respectively about 13 9 of the 379 brands of bottled water could not meet the who s recommended limit while 14 2 failed to comply with the u s fda s limit for better understanding of global situation a concentration profile of phthalates in bottled waters from various countries is presented in fig 1 the top five countries ranked in the order of high to low for dehp were thailand croatia czech republic saudi arabia and china with the average levels of 61 1 8 8 6 3 6 2 and 6 1 Î¼g l respectively these average values were all above the recommended limit of 6 Î¼g l by u s fda the average level of dehp in bottled water in pakistan was 3 8 Î¼g l which was ranked 6th and not extraordinarily high however the corresponding average levels of bbp dbp dmp and dep were remarkably high in which the average levels of dep and dmp were ranked 1st among all countries and were over 20 even 50 times higher than those of other countries with the average levels of 22 4 and 50 2 Î¼g l respectively meanwhile the average levels of bbp and dbp in pakistan were ranked 2nd and 3rd with 7 5 and 17 8 Î¼g l respectively the country with the reported highest average level of bbp was saudi arabia with 30 8 Î¼g l al saleh et al 2011 mousa et al 2013 while the country with the reported highest average level of dbp was mexico with 45 1 Î¼g l salazar beltran et al 2017 it is surprising as these countries with extremely high average levels of bbp dbp dmp or dep showed no remarkable high average concentrations of dehp 3 2 risk assessment of phthalates in bottled water 3 2 1 human daily intake the maximum and average daily intakes of adults and children were calculated according to the maximum and average concentrations of phthalates in bottled waters from various countries as shown in table 2 the calculated maximum daily intakes of dehp bbp dbp dep and dmp were 2 7 3 1 6 3 1 0 and 1 8 Î¼g kg bw d for adults respectively and 4 7 5 5 11 1 1 7 and 3 1 Î¼g kg bw d for children according to the recommended reference dose values the sf calculated for the selected phthalates with the maximum reported concentrations were all far above 1 for adults and children implying that the phthalates concentrations reported in bottled water should not pose serious safety concern this indeed is in good agreement with previous studies showing that bottled water was safe for human consumption montuori et al 2008 erythropel et al 2014 guart et al 2014a jeddi et al 2015b it should be realized that most investigations were primarily based on short term monitoring which may not adequately reflect the situation of prolonged storage of bottled water with a typical guarantee of at least one year hence the development of appropriate kinetic model for migration of phthalates during storage is necessary and helpful the data collected from the literature with regard to the release of phthalates from plastic bottle at different storage times and temperatures jeddi et al 2016 zaki and shoeib 2018 were fitted to different kinetic models as summarized in table 3 all models showed excellent fittings but polynomial fitting has evident defect for example the predicted values of phthalates such as dehp would turn to be negative when the storage time is over 158 d under the storage temperature of 25 c which is not reasonable however it is difficult to identify whether linear or exponential fit is more appropriate solely based on the information in table 3 fortunately the long term monitoring data over 184 d clearly suggested that the exponential model can provide the best fitting abboudi et al 2017 therefore the exponential model was used to predict the possible concentrations of phthalates in bottled water against the storage time with data from jeddi et al 2016 the dehp concentration was predicted to reach 10 Î¼g l after 284 days of storage at 25 c fig 2 versus 0 522 Î¼g l at the storage time of 45 days in fact after 180 days of storage the predicted dehp concentration already exceeded the recommended guidelines by u s fda 2012 i e 6 Î¼g l and who 2011 i e 8 Î¼g l these clearly suggest that phthalates in plastic bottled water would be accumulated significantly with prolonged storage eventually exceeding the recommended limits even within the water quality guarantee period therefore the quality of bottled water may change during the warranty period and the long term monitoring of phthalates in plastic bottled water is essential migrations of phthalates from plastic bottles to water had been reported to be positively correlated to temperature zaki and shoeib 2018 this is consistent with the data in fig 2 for the bottled water stored at 40 c and 4 8 c the respective times required for dehp to reach a predicted concentration of 10 Î¼g l were found to be 165 and 368 days in the case of jeddi et al 2016 i e low storage temperature can greatly decrease the migration of phthalates into water therefore it appears from the above discussion that the quality warranty period of plastic bottle water should be carefully be re examined in consideration of the potential migration of phthalates migrated from plastic bottle to water over water storage 3 2 2 potential estrogenic effect of phthalates estrogenic compounds ecs at environmentally relevant concentrations can adversely affect fishes and other animals causing vitellogenin intersex infertility and disruption to mating behaviors mortality etc liu et al 2017 nowadays some ecs have been strictly regulated in the drinking water quality standards of many countries e g bisphenol a dehp dep and dbp have been regulated in the chinese drinking water quality standard while e2 has been regulated in the latest japanese drinking water quality standards yuan et al 2016 2017 2018 to evaluate the potential estrogenic effects of phthalates average eeq levels in bottled waters from four different countries were calculated and summarized in table 4 bottled water from each of these countries had the highest average concentration of a specific phthalate the highest average eeq was found in bottled water from saudi arabia followed by pakistan and mexico with the lowest average eeq of 1 328 ng e2 l in bottled water from thailand so far the potential estrogenic effects of phthalates in bottled water have hardly been examined yet however the calculated average eeq levels in the selected four countries were reasonably high and could not be neglected even at the low eeq exposure level of 0 27 ng e2 l the egg mortality was observed in the late gastrulation and or early organogenesis in zebrafish soares et al 2009 as can be seen in table 4 the calculated average eeq levels in the bottled waters from the selected countries indeed were significantly at the level of 1 328 ng e2 l or above which were 4 9 time higher than that causing adverse estrogenic effects on zebrafish as reported by soares et al 2009 consequently this and previous studies all point to a fact that phthalates in the bottled water would likely pose serious concern on their potential estrogenic effects on human health it should also be realized that eeq levels of phthalates may increase significantly with prolonged water storage as ecs with the same eeq values may induce different adverse effects on human health it should be cautious in interpretation of the calculated high eeq values of phthalates in bottled water given the huge annual consumption of bottled water globally it should be stressed that the potential risks of phthalates as estrogenic compounds will need to be better understood and properly regulated in this aspect information available is still very limited thus extensive research efforts are definitely needed towards the safety of bottled water in relation to estrogenicity of phthalates 4 implications to safety of bottled water so far there is lack of a holistic analysis of phthalates concentrations in bottled waters across different countries as shown above this study probably for the first time systematically looked into the five representative phthalates in bottled waters from 21 countries about 13 9 of the 379 brands of bottled water could not meet the who s recommended limit while 14 2 failed to comply with the u s fda s limit in addition the concentrations of dbp and bbp in bottle waters from some countries were found to be remarkably high this in turn implies that both dbp and bbp in bottled water should be carefully regulated in the near future as their estrogenic potencies are more than 130 higher than that of dehp by analyzing the migration kinetics of phthalates from plastic bottle to water it was shown that the potential concentrations of migrated phthalates tended to increase in a significant manner with prolonged water storage during the water warranty period although the safety factor based risk assessment indicated that the levels of phthalates in all the reported bottled waters were acceptable in term of water safety surprisingly the calculated eeq levels revealed that phthalates in bottled waters from some countries may induce the adverse estrogenic effects on human health 5 conclusions this work provided a comprehensive picture of phthalates concentrations in global bottled waters accompanied with a risk assessment based on human daily intakes and estrogenic effects the following concluding remarks can be drawn from this study 1 the highest concentrations of the five selected phthalates i e dbp bbp dehp dmp and dep in bottled waters among 21 countries were found to be 222 0 109 0 94 1 61 3 and 34 2 Î¼g l respectively given their relative strong estrogenic potencies dbp and bbp should be also regulated in a way similar to dehp in fact recommended limits for target phthalates should need to be established urgently for bottled water 2 migrations of phthalates from plastic bottles to water could be described well by an exponential type model which was able to predict the effects of storage temperature and time on release of phthalates lower storage temperature and shorter storage time are preferable for mitigating potential release of phthalates from plastic bottle to water thus reducing human daily intakes of phthalates through water consumption 3 the human daily intake based risk assessment showed that phthalates in bottled water are at safe level but the high eeq values of phthalates in bottled water from some countries seemed alarming as phthalates at such levels might induce adverse estrogenic effects to human beings acknowledgement this work was financially supported by the key program of national

19228,increasing attention has been dedicated to trace phthalates in bottled water due to the serious concerns on public health while there is still a lack of systematic analysis and assessment of current global situation through analyzing five representative phthalates in bottled water over 20 countries this work clearly revealed the phthalates associated potential risks in both human daily intake and estrogenic effect in the risk assessment the kinetic models were also developed to describe and predict phthalates migration in more than three hundred brands of bottled waters from twenty one countries the detection frequency of the five targeted phthalates was found to be in the order of dibutyl phthalate dbp 67 6 di 2 ethyl hexyl phthalate dehp 61 7 diethyl phthalate dep 47 1 benzyl butyl phthalate bbp 36 9 and dimethyl phthalate dmp 30 1 among the countries studied relating concentrations of dehp in bottled waters the top five countries ranked in the order of high to low were thailand croatia czech republic saudi arabia and china with an average level of 61 1 8 8 6 3 6 2 and 6 1 Î¼g l respectively the average levels of bbp dbp dmp and dep in bottled water from pakistan were high in which dep and dmp were ranked 1st among all countries with the average levels of 22 4 and 50 2 Î¼g l while bbp and dbp were ranked 2nd and 3rd with the average levels of 7 5 and 17 8 Î¼g l respectively the human daily intake based risk assessment revealed that phthalates in bottled waters studied would not pose a serious concern on public health however the adverse estrogenic effects of phthalates in bottled water from some countries appeared to be significant this study just shed light on global situation of phthalates in bottled water and more efforts should be needed to systematically examine the phthalates related safety of bottled water graphical abstract image 1 keywords phthalates bottled water migration kinetics risk assessment daily intakes estrogenic effects 1

et al 2011 jones et al 2018 due to potential adverse effects of phthalates on public health many studies had examined the concentration levels of phthalates in bottled water together with the assessment of potential risks to human health bach et al 2012 santana et al 2014 jeddi et al 2015a 2016 meanwhile attention had also be dedicated to migration of phthalates from plastic bottles under different storage conditions bach et al 2013 diduch et al 2013 guart et al 2014a keresztes et al 2013 it is still not clear about global situation of phthalates in bottled waters worldwide devier et al 2013 santana et al 2014 zaater et al 2014 it should be realized that many studies had been conducted on a short term basis but most bottled water has at least one year quality warranty period these in turn indicate that long term monitoring of migration of phthalates is necessary but it is highly challenging in reality given such a situation mathematical model can provide a simple and effective option for predicting migration potential of phthalates during water storage therefore this study aimed to 1 provide phthalate levels in bottled waters produced from different countries 2 develop a kinetic model for migration of phthalates from plastic bottles to bottle water accompanied with a preliminary risk assessment on human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 target phthalates according to the reported detection frequency in bottled water five phthalates i e dehp bbp dbp dep and dmp were selected as the target compounds in this study and their physicochemical properties are presented in table 1 2 2 data sources the key words bottled water packaged water drinking water paes or phthalates were used to search for the relevant information on web of science scopus and scholar google over a period of 2000 2018 the total 59 publications from 21 countries were identified and used as the data sources for further analysis 2 3 migration kinetics of phthalates from plastic bottle to water the levels of phthalates in plastic bottled water had been commonly studied on a short term basis which is much shorter than the allowable quality guarantee period of at least one year to properly address such a challenge lacking long term monitoring data kinetic models describing the migration of phthalates from plastic bottle to water were developed in this study in which the effects of storage time and temperature were considered the data collected from the literature were fitted to different linear exponential and polynomial models as shown below 1 linear fit c a b t 2 exponential fit c a e x p b t 3 polynomial model fit c a b t c t 2 showing in equations 1 3 c is the phthalates concentration t is the storage time while a b and c are all fitting constants 2 4 calculating of country average concentration of phthalates in bottled water for convenience of comparison the average concentration of phthalates in bottled water in each country pa is calculated using the equation below 4 p a c i n i n i showing in equation 4 ci is the average concentration of phthalates in one study while ni is the corresponding sample size of bottled water with data summarized in table s1 profile of sample sizes of bottled water and average concentrations as well as concentration ranges of phthalates in bottled water is summarized in table s2 for bottled water without detection reported as not detected nd the corresponding phthalates concentration is taken as half of the limit of detection lod when the phthalates concentration in bottled water is above lod but below limit of quantification loq the calculating concentration is considered as half of the loq all related work in table s1 with reported phthalates concentrations were included in this study except for a work from thailand in which the reported concentrations of dehp dbp dep and dmp were nd 490 nd 330 nd and nd 530 Î¼g l respectively prapatpong and kanchanamayoon 2010 the reason to exclude this work is the extremely high lods of 25 50 Î¼g l in which the lods are one or more orders of magnitude higher than those of other studies to avoid miscalculation the investigated result in prapatpong and kanchanamayoon 2010 is not included 2 5 risk assessment 2 5 1 daily intake associated risk assessment human daily intake of phthalates through bottled water was calculated as follows 5 e i n c v w where ein c v and w are human daily intake of phthalates Î¼g kg bw d phthalates concentration in bottled water Î¼g l daily consumption of bottled water l d and human body weight kg the consumption of bottled water by adults and children are set to be 2 and 1 l per day respectively with the body weight of 70 kg for adults and 20 kg for children montuori et al 2008 huang et al 2017 2018 for human risk assessment the reported and predicted levels of phthalates were compared to the recommended values by u s fda 2012 and who 2011 by which the mcl maximum contaminant levels values are set to 6 and 8 Î¼g l respectively for the purpose of comparison the safety factor sf was also calculated as follows 6 s f r f d e i n where rfd is the reference dose given by regulations or guidelines epa 2009 sf below 1 indicates safety concern 2 5 2 estrogenic activity associated risk assessment as shown in table 1 some selected phthalates are estrogenic e g dehp bbp dbp and dep which are very weak estrogens in this study the concept of estrogen equivalence eeq was adopted for the purpose of comparison liu et al 2009 2010a b 7 e e q e p i c i where ep and c denote the estrogenic potency of an individual estrogenic phthalate and its corresponding concentration respectively ep of estrogenic compound is often determined by in vitro bioassays in which e2 with the strongest estrogenic activity among natural estrogens is often selected as the standard estrogenic compound i e the ep of e2 is arbitrarily set as 1 when the estrogenic activity of one compound is stronger than that of e2 its ep would above 1 otherwise the corresponding ep would below 1 therefore the unit of eeq is normally represented as ng e2 l 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and migration of phthalates in bottled water 3 1 1 potential sources of phthalates in bottled water trace residues of phthalates in bottled water may originate from different sources e g source water production process raw material of packaging and even background contamination in laboratory schmid et al 2008 sax 2010 bach et al 2012 guart et al 2014b szendi et al 2018 the investigation of 131 source waters in spain showed that all monitored phthalates including dmp dbp bbp dehp and dep were not detected except for a borehole source water close to an industrial area with a detected concentration of 1 12 Î¼g l dep bono blay et al 2012 contamination of phthalates may also come from production process but there is no quantitative study reported yet salazar beltran et al 2017 contamination of phthalates during sample preparation had also been reported and the main source was found to be air pollution to the syringe needle and such contamination indeed could be avoided by quick injection at the temperature below 40 c frankhause noti and grob 2007 marega et al 2013 with the analytical methods checked with linearity of calibration curves recovery sensitivity repeatability reproducibility and blank control false reports due to outer contamination during sample preparation are unlikely significant haned et al 2018 gonezalez salamo et al 2018 on the other hand the considerable contents of phthalates were found in plastic bottles e g the detected levels of dbp and dehp in plastic bottle were in the range of 21 72 and 393 1499 mg kg respectively otero et al 2015 while the detected levels of dbp dep and dmp were reported to be up to 63 5 3 1 and 14 8 mg kg respectively salazar beltran et al 2018 therefore it is reasonable to consider that the main source of phthalates in bottled water likely originated from plastic bottle instead of the other sources wu et al 2014 rastkari et al 2017 zaki and shoeib 2018 the regulations on phthalates have been established for food related plastic packaging material in which dehp dbp and bbp are limited to be 1 5 0 3 and 30 mg kg respectively eu 2015 consequently plastic bottle should be the main source of phthalates found in bottled water in addition trace phthalates were also detected in some glass bottled water which suggested that bottle cap is also a potential source leivadara et al 2008 prokupkova et al 2002 3 1 2 migration of phthalates from plastic bottle to water several factors may influence the migration of phthalates from plastic bottle to water e g storage conditions i e temperature time sunlight intensity ph bottle size etc as seen in table s3 the migration of phthalates in bottled water indeed resulted from the combined effects of multiple factors in general high temperature favors accelerate the migration zaater et al 2014 jeddi et al 2016 pourzamani et al 2017 while storage time was found to be positively correlated to the migration of phthalates from plastic bottle to water criado et al 2005 keresztes et al 2013 guart et al 2014b jeddi et al 2016 cincotta et al 2018 in addition the intensity of sunlight may also play an important role during migration because it may affect the degradation degree of phthalates lertsirisopon et al 2009 similarly ph also contributed to the observed migration of phthalates in bottled water with the contradictory results reported in the literature bosnir et al 2007 and martine et al 2013 found that acidic condition promoted the diffusion of phthalates on the contrary the majority of studies seemed to suggest that the higher ph is favorable for the migration of phthalates from plastic bottle biscardi et al 2003 montuori et al 2008 keresztes et al 2013 martine et al 2013 rastkari et al 2017 in addition there is no concrete evidence showing the effect of bottle size or more importantly the surface to volume ratio on the migration of phthalates e g positive or no correlation between them had been reported montuori et al 2008 keresztes et al 2013 3 1 3 a global picture of trace residues of phthalates in bottled water the trace residues of phthalates had been reported in bottled water of over three hundreds brands worldwide table s3 the detection frequency of the five selected phthalates in all the brands of the bottled water was in the order of dbp 67 6 dehp 61 7 dep 47 1 bbp 36 9 and dmp 30 1 the highest concentrations of dehp bbp dbp dep and dmp in all the bottled waters studied were found to be 94 1 109 0 222 0 34 2 and 61 3 Î¼g l respectively according to the recommendations of who 2011 and u s fda 2012 for dehp i e 8 and 6 Î¼g l respectively about 13 9 of the 379 brands of bottled water could not meet the who s recommended limit while 14 2 failed to comply with the u s fda s limit for better understanding of global situation a concentration profile of phthalates in bottled waters from various countries is presented in fig 1 the top five countries ranked in the order of high to low for dehp were thailand croatia czech republic saudi arabia and china with the average levels of 61 1 8 8 6 3 6 2 and 6 1 Î¼g l respectively these average values were all above the recommended limit of 6 Î¼g l by u s fda the average level of dehp in bottled water in pakistan was 3 8 Î¼g l which was ranked 6th and not extraordinarily high however the corresponding average levels of bbp dbp dmp and dep were remarkably high in which the average levels of dep and dmp were ranked 1st among all countries and were over 20 even 50 times higher than those of other countries with the average levels of 22 4 and 50 2 Î¼g l respectively meanwhile the average levels of bbp and dbp in pakistan were ranked 2nd and 3rd with 7 5 and 17 8 Î¼g l respectively the country with the reported highest average level of bbp was saudi arabia with 30 8 Î¼g l al saleh et al 2011 mousa et al 2013 while the country with the reported highest average level of dbp was mexico with 45 1 Î¼g l salazar beltran et al 2017 it is surprising as these countries with extremely high average levels of bbp dbp dmp or dep showed no remarkable high average concentrations of dehp 3 2 risk assessment of phthalates in bottled water 3 2 1 human daily intake the maximum and average daily intakes of adults and children were calculated according to the maximum and average concentrations of phthalates in bottled waters from various countries as shown in table 2 the calculated maximum daily intakes of dehp bbp dbp dep and dmp were 2 7 3 1 6 3 1 0 and 1 8 Î¼g kg bw d for adults respectively and 4 7 5 5 11 1 1 7 and 3 1 Î¼g kg bw d for children according to the recommended reference dose values the sf calculated for the selected phthalates with the maximum reported concentrations were all far above 1 for adults and children implying that the phthalates concentrations reported in bottled water should not pose serious safety concern this indeed is in good agreement with previous studies showing that bottled water was safe for human consumption montuori et al 2008 erythropel et al 2014 guart et al 2014a jeddi et al 2015b it should be realized that most investigations were primarily based on short term monitoring which may not adequately reflect the situation of prolonged storage of bottled water with a typical guarantee of at least one year hence the development of appropriate kinetic model for migration of phthalates during storage is necessary and helpful the data collected from the literature with regard to the release of phthalates from plastic bottle at different storage times and temperatures jeddi et al 2016 zaki and shoeib 2018 were fitted to different kinetic models as summarized in table 3 all models showed excellent fittings but polynomial fitting has evident defect for example the predicted values of phthalates such as dehp would turn to be negative when the storage time is over 158 d under the storage temperature of 25 c which is not reasonable however it is difficult to identify whether linear or exponential fit is more appropriate solely based on the information in table 3 fortunately the long term monitoring data over 184 d clearly suggested that the exponential model can provide the best fitting abboudi et al 2017 therefore the exponential model was used to predict the possible concentrations of phthalates in bottled water against the storage time with data from jeddi et al 2016 the dehp concentration was predicted to reach 10 Î¼g l after 284 days of storage at 25 c fig 2 versus 0 522 Î¼g l at the storage time of 45 days in fact after 180 days of storage the predicted dehp concentration already exceeded the recommended guidelines by u s fda 2012 i e 6 Î¼g l and who 2011 i e 8 Î¼g l these clearly suggest that phthalates in plastic bottled water would be accumulated significantly with prolonged storage eventually exceeding the recommended limits even within the water quality guarantee period therefore the quality of bottled water may change during the warranty period and the long term monitoring of phthalates in plastic bottled water is essential migrations of phthalates from plastic bottles to water had been reported to be positively correlated to temperature zaki and shoeib 2018 this is consistent with the data in fig 2 for the bottled water stored at 40 c and 4 8 c the respective times required for dehp to reach a predicted concentration of 10 Î¼g l were found to be 165 and 368 days in the case of jeddi et al 2016 i e low storage temperature can greatly decrease the migration of phthalates into water therefore it appears from the above discussion that the quality warranty period of plastic bottle water should be carefully be re examined in consideration of the potential migration of phthalates migrated from plastic bottle to water over water storage 3 2 2 potential estrogenic effect of phthalates estrogenic compounds ecs at environmentally relevant concentrations can adversely affect fishes and other animals causing vitellogenin intersex infertility and disruption to mating behaviors mortality etc liu et al 2017 nowadays some ecs have been strictly regulated in the drinking water quality standards of many countries e g bisphenol a dehp dep and dbp have been regulated in the chinese drinking water quality standard while e2 has been regulated in the latest japanese drinking water quality standards yuan et al 2016 2017 2018 to evaluate the potential estrogenic effects of phthalates average eeq levels in bottled waters from four different countries were calculated and summarized in table 4 bottled water from each of these countries had the highest average concentration of a specific phthalate the highest average eeq was found in bottled water from saudi arabia followed by pakistan and mexico with the lowest average eeq of 1 328 ng e2 l in bottled water from thailand so far the potential estrogenic effects of phthalates in bottled water have hardly been examined yet however the calculated average eeq levels in the selected four countries were reasonably high and could not be neglected even at the low eeq exposure level of 0 27 ng e2 l the egg mortality was observed in the late gastrulation and or early organogenesis in zebrafish soares et al 2009 as can be seen in table 4 the calculated average eeq levels in the bottled waters from the selected countries indeed were significantly at the level of 1 328 ng e2 l or above which were 4 9 time higher than that causing adverse estrogenic effects on zebrafish as reported by soares et al 2009 consequently this and previous studies all point to a fact that phthalates in the bottled water would likely pose serious concern on their potential estrogenic effects on human health it should also be realized that eeq levels of phthalates may increase significantly with prolonged water storage as ecs with the same eeq values may induce different adverse effects on human health it should be cautious in interpretation of the calculated high eeq values of phthalates in bottled water given the huge annual consumption of bottled water globally it should be stressed that the potential risks of phthalates as estrogenic compounds will need to be better understood and properly regulated in this aspect information available is still very limited thus extensive research efforts are definitely needed towards the safety of bottled water in relation to estrogenicity of phthalates 4 implications to safety of bottled water so far there is lack of a holistic analysis of phthalates concentrations in bottled waters across different countries as shown above this study probably for the first time systematically looked into the five representative phthalates in bottled waters from 21 countries about 13 9 of the 379 brands of bottled water could not meet the who s recommended limit while 14 2 failed to comply with the u s fda s limit in addition the concentrations of dbp and bbp in bottle waters from some countries were found to be remarkably high this in turn implies that both dbp and bbp in bottled water should be carefully regulated in the near future as their estrogenic potencies are more than 130 higher than that of dehp by analyzing the migration kinetics of phthalates from plastic bottle to water it was shown that the potential concentrations of migrated phthalates tended to increase in a significant manner with prolonged water storage during the water warranty period although the safety factor based risk assessment indicated that the levels of phthalates in all the reported bottled waters were acceptable in term of water safety surprisingly the calculated eeq levels revealed that phthalates in bottled waters from some countries may induce the adverse estrogenic effects on human health 5 conclusions this work provided a comprehensive picture of phthalates concentrations in global bottled waters accompanied with a risk assessment based on human daily intakes and estrogenic effects the following concluding remarks can be drawn from this study 1 the highest concentrations of the five selected phthalates i e dbp bbp dehp dmp and dep in bottled waters among 21 countries were found to be 222 0 109 0 94 1 61 3 and 34 2 Î¼g l respectively given their relative strong estrogenic potencies dbp and bbp should be also regulated in a way similar to dehp in fact recommended limits for target phthalates should need to be established urgently for bottled water 2 migrations of phthalates from plastic bottles to water could be described well by an exponential type model which was able to predict the effects of storage temperature and time on release of phthalates lower storage temperature and shorter storage time are preferable for mitigating potential release of phthalates from plastic bottle to water thus reducing human daily intakes of phthalates through water consumption 3 the human daily intake based risk assessment showed that phthalates in bottled water are at safe level but the high eeq values of phthalates in bottled water from some countries seemed alarming as phthalates at such levels might induce adverse estrogenic effects to human beings acknowledgement this work was financially supported by the key program of national

19229,soil contamination by heavy metals and metalloids has been a major concern to human health and environmental quality while many remediation technologies have been tested at the bench scale there have been only limited reports at the field scale this paper aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the field applications of various soil remediation technologies performed over the last decade or so under the general categories of physical chemical and biological approaches ten remediation techniques were critically reviewed the technical feasibility and economic effectiveness were evaluated and the pros and cons were appraised in addition attention was placed to the environmental impacts of the remediation practices and long term stability of the contaminants which should be

with a host of heavy metals and metalloids such as chromium cr arsenic as cadmium cd copper cu mercury hg lead pb selenium se zinc zn and nickel ni there have been over 10 million major contaminated sites worldwide of which more than 50 were contaminated with heavy metals and or metalloids khalid et al 2016 in the u s around 600 000 ha of land especially at the brown field sites have been found contaminated with heavy metals and the u s environmental protection agency epa has designated more than 50 000 heavy metals polluted sites as the national priority sites which require urgent remediation actions ensley 2000 in china the average contents of cd hg as cu pb cr zn and ni in soil have been found to have exceeded the regulation levels by 7 0 1 6 2 7 2 1 1 5 1 1 0 9 and 4 8 respectively according to the ministry of environmental protection and ministry of land and resources of china bulletin on natural survey of soil contamination in 2014 heavy metals and metalloids have been a major threat to human and environmental health due to their non biodegradability toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation in the food chain they have been found responsible for causing various disorders in humans including cardiovascular diseases cancer cognitive impairment chronic anemia and damage of kidneys nervous system brain skin and bones jÃ¤rup 2003 for instance exposure to lead has been associated with improper hemoglobin synthesis and tumor infection elevated blood pressure and dysfunction of reproductive system pourrut et al 2011 consequently it is imperative to develop and deploy innovative and site specific remediation technologies for efficient clean up of heavy metals or metalloids contaminated sites to remediate soil contaminated with heavy metals or metalloids many studies have been carried out at the bench scale and under well controlled conditions ye et al 2017a 2017b however due to the complexity of the actual soil biogeochemical conditions the technical

delivered chemicals on the local biogeochemical conditions and the long term stabilities of immobilized contaminants remain to be addressed through systematic field scale studies and long term monitoring under real world environmental conditions over the last decade or so various physical chemical and biological processes have been aimed at reducing the total concentrations and or bioavailable fractions of heavy metals or metalloids in order to mitigate the subsequent accumulation along the food chain bhargava et al 2012 fig 1 to reduce the total contaminant mass in soil a

and phytoextraction mahar et al 2016 on the other hand to mitigate bioavailability or bioaccumulation various chemical immobilization techniques are often employed using a range of chemical compounds such as lime wu et al 2016 phosphate compounds qayyum et al 2017 sun et al 2018 and organic compounds basta et al 2001 li et al 2016 placek et al 2016 in addition vitrification mallampati et al 2015 solidification stabilization wang et al 2014a and phytostabilization cheng et al 2016 have also been investigated at the field however most of the field cleanup actions are often practiced by remediation industries as a result information is often less systematic or long term monitoring of completed site is lacking in addition the environmental impacts of the remediation practices are often ignored to our knowledge most documents and reviews on the heavy metal remediation technologies have been focused on lab scale results khalid et al 2016 yao et al 2012 bolan et al 2014 reviewed some remediation technologies focusing on laboratory and greenhouse studies using a various mobilizing and immobilizing soil amendments with four field case studies on soil washing and chemical stabilization methods yet comprehensive reviews on field scale applications have been very limited over the last decade or so consequently a thorough review is needed to connect the dots and to synthesize the information in order to evaluate the state of the technology and identify future research needs the main purpose of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the remediation practices performed under field conditions for remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals and or metalloids specifically the review aimed to 1 evaluate the technical effectiveness of various remediation technologies that have been applied at the field scale 2 elucidate the underlying technical principles 3 assess the technical applicability limitations ecological impacts and cost effectiveness and 4 identify critical knowledge gaps and future research needs this review will provide useful information for both the industries and scientific research community to develop innovative remediation technologies and for site managers to adopt the most suitable remediation techniques under specific site conditions 2 sources and chemical speciation of heavy metals and metalloids and regulatory trend both natural and anthropogenic sources can lead to serious soil contamination by metals metalloids although the latter is often blamed to be the culprit in the modern time natural sources may include geological breakdown of parent rock materials and volcanic eruptions the earth crust is composed of 95 of ingenious rocks and 5 of sedimentary rocks thornton 1981 typically basaltic ingenious rocks contain high concentrations of co cd zn cu and ni whereas shales contain large amounts of zn cu mn cd and pb khalid et al 2016 in soil groundwater systems these heavy metals exist as carbonates sulfides oxides or salts anthropogenic sources are primarily associated with refining and mining of ores batteries paper industries tanneries fertilizer and pesticides industries biosolids application wastewater irrigation and atmospheric depositions and combustion of fossil fuels mahar et al 2016 heavy metals can be released in inorganic organic and or elemental forms ross 1994 divided the anthropogenic sources of heavy metals into five groups namely 1 agricultural zn as pb cd cu se and u 2 metalliferous mining and smelting cd pb as and hg 3 industrial cd hg as cr cu co ni and zn 4 waste disposal as pb cu cd cr zn and hg and 5 atmospheric deposition as pb cr hg cu cd and u heavy metals can be bound to various compartments in soil namely amorphous materials clay surfaces or iron manganese oxyhydroxides lattice of secondary minerals like carbonates sulfates or oxides organic matter or lattice of primary minerals such as silicates tessier et al 1979 yu et al 2001 because soil adsorption or solid phase speciation can greatly impact the mobility and availabilities of metals metalloids it has been increasingly recognized that the toxicity and reactivity are often governed by the available fraction of the contaminants rather than the total contaminant concentration namely specific chemical speciation of metals metalloids nyamangara 1998 as well as interactions with various soil components including soil organic matter som should be taken into account in establishing remediation goals to determine the relative availabilities of metals metalloids in soil various sequential extraction procedures seps are often employed guevara riba et al 2004 these operationally defined methodologies use a series of selective extracting reagents to successively dissolve different fractions of metals metalloids that are bound with various fractions of mineralogical components gleyzes et al 2002 for instance the sep by tessier et al 1979 operationally divides soil bound heavy metals into five geochemical forms i e water soluble and exchangeable carbonate bound iron and manganese oxide associated organic matter bound and residual forms the water soluble and exchangeable fractions are considered to be the most available components and the fractions bound to carbonate oxide and organic matter are supposed to represent the potentially bioavailable components under changing conditions whereas the residual fraction represents the most stable form associated with anthropogenic or geogenic components which is considered unavailable to plants or microorganisms from a soil remediation standpoint the general trend has been shifting from reduction of the total concentration to reduction of the physic chemically and or biologically available fractions of metals this regulatory shift represents a tremendous saving in remediation cost while metals are not degradable their speciation and binding with soil may be manipulated through various amending reagents or materials thereby reducing their solubility mobility and bioavailability accordingly remediation goals are often based on leachabilities of soil sorbed metals metalloids for instance the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp epa method 1311 has been widely used in the u s and many other countries to gauge remediation effectiveness or identify hazardous materials where the thresholds are often set at 100 times the corresponding maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water in china sulfuric acid and nitric acid method hj t299 2007 has been used in measuring the degree of success in remediation of metals metalloids contaminated soil 3 field scale remediation technologies depending on the type of heavy metals metalloids and site characteristics different remediation technologies may be applied table 1 summarizes the most commonly used physical chemical and biological processes given the complex nature of soil biogeochemical conditions and the distribution of contaminants various remediation approaches are often combined to achieve the remediation goals 3 1 physical remediation 3 1 1 soil replacement soil replacement relies on the use of non contaminated soil to replace or partly replace the contaminated soil aiming to dilute the heavy metal contents in soil to increase the soil environmental capacity and thus remediate the soil derakhshan nejad et al 2017 prior to 1984 excavation off site disposal and soil replacement were the most commonly methods for cleaning up contaminated sites douay et al 2008 carried out soil replacement remediation at three kitchen gardens garden 1 2 and 3 situated less than 1 km from the metaleurop nord smelter in northern france the sites were contaminated with high concentrations of pb and cd up to 3300 and 24 mg kg respectively in the top soil they delineated a surface area of 80 m2 for garden 1 50 m2 for garden 2 and 100 m2 for garden 3 and replaced 28 m3 17 5 m3 and 40 m3 of the contaminated soil with a local clean soil respectively after the soil replacement cultivation of vegetables showed a clear improvement of vegetables cd and pb levels in radish leaves were reduced from 26 2 mg kg and 41 2 mg kg to 3 0 mg kg and 8 4 mg kg respectively after the remediation action the replaced contaminated soil was exported to metaleurop nord for the use of slag heap coverage this technique is costly due to intensive labor and is feasible for small volumes of heavily polluted shallow soil in small area in addition the removed contaminated soil often falls into the category of hazardous wastes demanding costly further handling and disposal it may not be applicable to agricultural sites which are characterized of large volume of soil and low concentration of contaminants due to the associated high cost and potential loss of soil fertility and may be limited by the availability of the clean replacement soil 3 1 2 vitrification vitrification is a high temperature process in which organic matter is incinerated and mineral matter is melted leading to the sequestration of metals metalloids in a small volume of vitreous material mallampati et al 2015 vitrification can be applied both in situ and above ground in a treatment unit ex situ two primary heat sources include thermal energy by using combustion of fossil fuels and electrical energy through the joule effect electric arc induction or plasma processes colombo et al 2003 during vitrification some metal species such as hg may be volatilized which may be subject to regulatory constraints and require additional handling and treatment dellisanti et al 2009 carried out an in field joule heating vitrification of tons of zn and pb rich ceramic waste fig 2 they reported that heating the waste up to about 1850 c completely melted the waste material and the rapid cooling formed a monolithic glassified material of 55 tons which effectively immobilized the heavy metals and non volatile inorganic compounds wang et al 2008a conducted a pilot scale experiment to treat a fly ash from a municipal solid waste incinerator using a diesel oil furnace for more than six months they observed that the residual levels of stabilized heavy metals cd cr cu pb and zn in the melted slag followed the order of cr zn cu cd pb and that the tclp leachable concentrations of all the heavy metals were far below the regulatory values temperature is the key factor in terms of both immobilization effectives and process cost while traditional fuel based or electrical heating is often cost prohibitive recent solar technology may facilitate remarkable energy saving for example navarro et al 2013 investigated the vitrification of hazardous mine wastes and mine tailing from old mercury and agpb mines in spain using solar technology and observed successful immobilization of fe mn ni cu and zn at 1350 c in addition the electrical conductivity of the target soil waste may limit the effectiveness as soil vitrification involves insertion of electrodes into the soil it is critical for the medium to be able to carry electrical current thus a main limitation of in situ vitrification is the potential of the soil to melt so that current can pass through it soil containing high alkali e g 1 4 wt may not be a good conductor buelt and thompson 1992 therefore in situ vitrification can be performed only for wet soil with low alkali content this technique can be applied for small scale remediation of heavily polluted sites it permanently remediates the soil with long term effectiveness and much reduced waste volume and may produce products with potential reuse options however under field conditions or at large scale this technique can be highly expensive 3 1 3 electrokinetic remediation electrokinetic remediation is a new and effective physical method for remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals or metalloids as depicted in fig 3 this technique relies on an electric field gradient of suitable intensity that is established across an electrolytic tank containing saturated soil the electrodes are generally immersed into constructed wells containing an electrolytic solution under the electric field the target metal ions migrate towards the oppositely charged electrodes the contaminants accumulated at the electrodes are then treated with various physical chemical approaches including electroplating precipitation co precipitation pump and treat the water near the electrodes or sorption with ion exchange resins reddy et al 2001 rosestolato et al 2015 carried out a field scale project on electrokinetic remediation of 400 kg of a mercury contaminated soil and found that about 60 of total hg was removed in less than 3 months kim et al 2012 applied an in situ electrokinetic technique to clean up multiple metals metalloids in a contaminated rice field and they observed that 39 8 17 2 and 19 4 of as cu and pb respectively were removed after 4 weeks of the treatment earlier kim et al 2011 carried out a pilot scale electrokinetic test and achieved 96 8 removal of uranium from a uranium contaminated soil after 25 days the main mechanisms of electrokinetic remediation include electrophoresis movement of charged particles electric seepage or electro migration movement of charged chemicals electro osmosis fluid movement and electrolysis redox reactions induced by the electric current yao et al 2012 electro migration is one to two orders of magnitude faster than the other mechanisms and thus is the dominant mass transfer mechanism for heavy metals metalloids virkutyte et al 2002 electrolysis of water is the dominant electron transfer reaction occurring at electrodes during the electrokinetic process 1 h 2 o 2 h 1 2 o 2 g 2 e a n o d e 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 oh h 2 g c a t h o d e the h ions produced at the anode decrease the local ph which is conducive to desorption of metallic cations from the soil phase because of the elevated competition of h ions and more positive soil surface potential and adsorption of oxyanions such as arsenate conversely oh ions at the cathode cause an increase of ph which is in favor of soil adsorption of heavy metals or formation of precipitates as hydroxides and oxyhydroxides in addition the h ions at the anode may migrate through the soil towards the cathode whereas the oh ions migrate towards the anode depending on the extent of migration of h and oh ph may vary across the soil the high ph region in the proximity to the cathode is the main obstacle to heavy metal removal from the soil to improve the effectiveness surfactants e g tween 80 tween 20 and rhamnolipid biosurfactant and complexing agents e g humic substances citric acid ammonium acetate nitrilotriacetic acid diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid and ethyleneglycol tetraacetic acid have been applied alcÃ¡ntara et al 2012 ammami et al 2015 bahemmat et al 2016 chen et al 2011 falciglia et al 2016 fu et al 2017 giannis et al 2009 maturi et al 2009 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta is a strong metal complexing agent that can extract and enhance the mobility of heavy metals from soil hanay et al 2009 and has been applied successfully in the field jeon et al 2015 remediated a paddy rice soil contaminated with pb and cu via an in situ electrokinetic process using edta as an electrolyte to enhance the metals extraction the negatively charged metal edta complexes were transported towards the anode as a result 40 3 of cu and 46 6 of pb were removed from the soil after 24 weeks of operation electrokinetic remediation is also used in combination with other processes such as microbial process lee and kim 2010 phytoremediation cameselle et al 2013b and permeable reactive barriers prbs zhao et al 2016 chung 2009 combined electrokinetic treatment with prb to remediate a cu contaminated site the perforated cathode pile was filled with reactive materials consequently the migrating cu2 ions in the soil were adsorbed at the cathode after 30 days of operation the cu removal reached 68 7 93 7 75 0 88 0 and 4 7 respectively when iron powder zeolite slag powder tire chip and sand were used the advantages of electrokinetic remediation include 1 it produces no or little by products 2 it is easy to install and operate and effective for soil with low permeability 3 it does not abolish the original nature of the soil and 4 the treatment duration is relatively short however this technique bears with some critical drawbacks including 1 it is only applicable for saturated soil with low groundwater flow 2 it only removes a part of leachable metals metalloids 3 it is less effective for heterogeneous soil 4 the energy cost can be prohibitive especially when higher removal is required and 5 the application of the electrical field may cause fluctuation in soil ph or significant alteration in local biogeochemical conditions 3 1 4 thermal treatment thermal treatment is a physical process based on the volatility of contaminants while the process is more suitable for volatile organic compounds it has been used for removal of volatile metals such as hg it is performed by heating contaminated soil via steam microwave or infrared radiation without combustion or melting of the media or contaminants the volatilized metals are then collected under negative pressure or with a carrier gas compared to vitrification or incineration thermal treatment is much less energy intensive and has the advantage that it can simultaneously remove volatile compounds that are often co present with metals metalloids inorganic mercury is usually present in soil in the elemental state or as mercurial compounds such as hgs hgo and hgco3 thermal treatment can covert the mercurial compounds into the gaseous elemental mercury the main components of a thermal desorption system include a pre treatment and material handling unit a desorption unit and a post treatment unit for treatment of off gas and processed soil the pre treatment involves physical screening to remove extraneous matter such as plastic or rubber and dewatering to achieve suitable moisture content a thermal desorption unit was employed to remove hg from the pre treated media which was operated at temperatures from 320 to 700 c usepa 2007 the high temperature converts mercury into its gaseous form which is then collected and further treated it is one of the few methods that have been applied to the field for removing very high concentrations of hg 260 mg kg in soil temperature and treatment time are the main factors determining the decontamination levels as well as the process cost wang et al 2012a 2012b greater efficiency is achieved at relatively higher temperatures e g from 460 to 700 c busto et al 2011 richter and flachberger 2010 hseu et al 2014 reported that heating soil to 550 c for 1 h was able to remove 99 of hg moreover thermal treatment at high temperatures may alter the soil properties and cause the coexisting contaminants especially trace metals to transform and repartition huang et al 2011 found that thermal treatment at 550 c reduced the mercury content from 1320 to 6 mg kg and altered the binding forms of cr cu and ni from those associated with fe mn oxides into acid extractable organic matter bound and residual forms which are less mobile high energy consumption has been a major concern of this technology to reduce energy consumption thermal treatment may be operated at a lower temperature for a longer time kucharski et al 2005 operated thermal treatment at 100 c for 10 days for remediation of a mercury contaminated soil and was able to achieve 32 mercury removal without negative effects on the growth properties of the soil the advantages of this method include easy and safe implementation mobility of treatment devices effective extraction and recovery of mercury and in particular simultaneous removal or immobilization of co contaminants the major shortcoming is the high energy consumption and capital costs due to the high temperature requirement and the specialized facilities required consequently this technology has been solely used for soil containing very high mercury as far as heavy metals are concerned thermal treatment alters soil properties which can affect certain functions of soil it can cause degradation of som and changes of soil texture and mineralogy combustion of som leads to the loss of c and n altering the available nutrients and elements for plants moreover soil heating is detrimental to microorganisms such as pathogens bacteria and fungi o brien et al 2018 3 2 chemical remediation 3 2 1 chemical stabilization chemical stabilization is a remediation process in which immobilizing agents are added to contaminated soil to decrease the mobility bioavailability and bioaccessibility of heavy metals in soil heavy metals can be immobilized by surface complexation chemical precipitation ion exchange and adsorption thus limiting the transport and bioavailability of heavy metals in soil porter et al 2004 the most commonly applied amending agents in the field include clay minerals phosphate compounds liming materials organic composts metal oxides and biochar table 2 chemical stabilization is a relatively cost effective simple and rapid remediation approach however it does not remove the heavy metals from soil consequently the long term stability should be monitored 3 2 1 1 clay minerals clay minerals are generally regarded as the fine particles contained in the colloidal fraction of soil and sediment they can act as a natural scavenger of heavy metals through ion exchange adsorption and surface processes such as precipitation nucleation and crystallization yuan et al 2013 clay minerals such as aluminosilicates sepiolite palygorskite and bentonite have been widely used for immobilization of heavy metals at the field scale liang et al 2014 sun et al 2015 2016 these naturally abundant materials have the advantages of being green low cost and effective for performance host of heavy metals or metalloids sepiolite mg4si6o15 oh 2 6h2o is a porous fibrous hydrated magnesium silicate it is composed of blocks of two tetrahedral silica sheets which sandwich an octahedral sheet of magnesium oxide hydroxide there are discontinuities and inversions in the silica sheet in sepiolite which give rise to its structural tunnels and blocks akÃ§ay 2004 these tunnels contain h2o molecules and exchangeable cations k and ca2 in the inner blocks all corners of the silica tetrahedral are connected to adjacent blocks whereas in the outer blocks some of the corners are si atoms bound to hydroxyls sioh these sioh groups are the main active centers for metal polycations tekin et al 2006 palygorskite mg al 2si4o10 oh 4h2o is a magnesium aluminum phyllosilicate with a fibrous morphology large specific surface area moderate cation exchange capacity cec and good adsorptive properties the remediation effectiveness of sepiolite and palygorskite has been confirmed in many field demonstrations as shown in table 2 for instance liang et al 2014 conducted a field demonstration experiment in chenzhou hunan province china utilizing sepiolite and palygorskite as amendments to in situ immobilize cd in soil and thereby reducing accumulation of cd in brown grains of rice after 30 days of the amendments the paddy soil ph was increased whereas the hcl tclp cacl2 and nh4oac extractable cd concentrations were significantly reduced resulting in a notable decrease in the cd content in the brown rice chemical precipitation and surface complexation were the main immobilization mechanisms sun et al 2016 investigated the effectiveness and stability of sepiolite for immobilization of cd polluted soil through a three year field experiment the addition of sepiolite resulted in a 4 0 32 5 reduction in tclp extractable cd and a 22 8 61 4 reduction in plant uptake and improved the soil microbial population and enzymatic activities bentonite a 2 1 type of aluminosilicate is a kind of expandable clay composed primarily of montmorillonite due to the isomorphic substitution within the aluminosilicate sheets bentonite is characterized by high permanent negative charges and large specific surface area the negative net charge is balanced by exchangeable cations adsorbed between the unit layers and around their edges narayanan and deshpande 1998 bentonite has been applied effectively for remediation of paddy soil polluted with cd and pb in pot trials sun et al 2015 after 5 weeks of bentonite application at dosages of 0 5 5 the exchangeable fractions of cd and pb were reduced by 11 1 42 5 and 20 3 49 3 respectively whereas the residual portions increased by 3 0 54 3 and 6 7 10 0 the treatments inhibited cd and pb translocation from soil to the aerial parts of oryza sativa l the concentrations of cd and pb in the roots were reduced by 9 4 31 3 and 5 1 26 7 and by 17 4 44 3 and 3 7 7 8 in the shoots respectively there are several limitations associated with the use of clay minerals first it is difficult to deliver the minerals into the deep contaminated zones and thus limiting their uses for in situ soil remediation second the reaction rate is limited by the desorption rate of heavy metals or metalloids from soil third mechanical mixing is usually needed for field soil treatment fourth clay minerals have limited sorption capacity and selectivity for metals as such large dosages are usually required and the immobilized metals metalloids are likely to be remobilized there is a need to enhance the remediation effect and reduce the dosage to lower costs in addition long term monitoring is needed to evaluate the long term stability 3 2 1 2 phosphate compounds soluble phosphate compounds and particulate phosphate minerals have been widely studied for immobilization of heavy metals commonly used phosphate minerals include both natural and synthetic apatite and hydroxyapatite whereas soluble phosphate compounds include phosphate salts and phosphoric acid in principle phosphate containing minerals immobilize heavy metals through direct metal adsorption substitution phosphate induced metal adsorption or surface complexation and chemical precipitation of metals bolan et al 2003a 2003b soluble phosphates can react with multivalent metal cations to form insoluble metal orthophosphates akin to naturally occurring minerals which are usually sparingly soluble with a low solubility product k sp and are stable in the natural biogeochemical environment phosphate can form strong complexes or precipitates with many common heavy metals such as pb k sp of pb5 po4 3cl 10 84 4 ruby et al 1994 cd e g cd3 po4 2oh k sp 10 42 5 and cu k sp of cu5 po4 3cl 10 54 0 cu5 po4 3oh k sp 10 51 6 eighmy et al 1997 eighmy and dykstra eusden 2004 field scale applications of phosphate compounds to immobilize heavy metals have gained growing momentum over the last decade wang et al 2008b undertook a field demonstration using commercial phosphate fertilizers including phosphate rock pr and calcium magnesium phosphate cmp at a site heavily contaminated by pb zn and cd from lead and zinc mining tailings in shaoxing zhejiang china they found that the addition of the pr and cmp fertilizers at different dosages 50 300 and 500 g m2 effectively decreased water soluble and exchangeable fractions by 22 0 81 4 for pb 1 5 30 7 for cd and 11 7 75 3 for zn and tclp extractable pb by 27 71 resulting in reduced uptakes of pb 16 0 58 0 cd 16 5 66 9 and zn 1 2 73 2 by a chinese green vegetable brassica chinensis l campestris qayyum et al 2017 reported that the application of mono ammonium phosphate map in a cd contaminated field significantly enhanced cd immobilization and decreased bioavailable cd in soil resulting in an increase in wheat growth and yield and an decrease in cd accumulation in the straw and grains nanoscale materials have shown great potential for soil remediation due to their small particle size large specific surface area high reactivity and improved soil deliverability sun et al 2018 found that nanoscale calcium hydroxyapatite nano hap was effective for immobilizing cu and zn in a heavy metal polluted soil near a smelting factory the addition of nano hap at 1 3 and 5 reduced the acid soluble fraction of cu by 9 3 24 4 and 35 7 respectively while the reducible and oxidizable fractions of cu were increased by 5 5 and 83 5 respectively at 5 of the nanoparticles as a result the cacl2 extractable concentrations of cu and zn were reduced by 67 8 93 0 and 97 3 and by 63 1 91 5 and 98 5 at a nanoparticle dosage of 1 3 and 5 respectively fig 4 a similarly the tclp leachable cu and zn concentrations were decreased by 27 9 48 8 and 62 8 and by 1 8 22 9 and 27 0 respectively fig 4b the key technical obstacles with this technology are the deliverability of the particles reaction rate and the long term effectiveness typically powder or particulate phosphate minerals or aggregated nanoparticles are added to soil through off situ mixing and thus are suitable for shallow soil that is polluted with high concentrations of heavy metals while the reaction rate is often slow and is limited by the desorption rate of the target metals from the soil the phosphate minerals may offer prolonged effectiveness and may provide a permanent sink for the metals in contrast soluble phosphate may be easily injected into the target soil and provide faster reaction with the target metals and reach the metals in deeper soil however soluble phosphate may only offer shorter reaction lifetime and most phosphate may be unused and washed into the downstream which may cause secondary contamination issues liu and zhao 2007 liu and zhao 2007 2013 developed a new class of stabilized phosphate nanoparticles carboxymethyl cellulose cmc stabilized iron phosphate and cmc stabilized ca phosphate the stabilized nanoparticles can be delivered into moderately permeable soil and facilitate in situ remediation the nanoparticles not only offer much improved binding rate and capacity but also well controlled transport in the subsurface i e their mobility can be controlled by manipulating external injection pressure he et al 2009 once delivered the nanoparticles will remain in the confined domain without spreading as soluble phosphates do phosphate based amending agents are of particular interest to remediation of agricultural soil not only are these materials innocuous to the crops they may also serve as slow releasing fertilizers while binding with the target heavy metals yet more field data are needed to gauge the long term effectiveness and assess the associated impacts on the crops and the local environment 3 2 1 3 liming materials common liming materials include oyster shells and eggshells lim et al 2013 lime and limestone he et al 2016 for their affordable price and ready availability liming materials have been widely accepted as a low cost and effective amendment in reducing the toxicity of heavy metals in field applications soil liming enhances sorption and or precipitation of heavy metals by increasing soluble ph and increasing the negative surface potential of soil matrices cui et al 2016a reported that lime amendment effectively decreased the leachability tclp and synthetic precipitation leaching procedure splp availability cacl2 and macl2 and bioaccessibility simplified bioaccessibility extraction test sbet of cu and cd in a contaminated soil in guixi city jiangxi province china for instance the tclp extractable cu concentration was decreased by 7 90 mg l compared with control and the sbet extractable cu was reduced from 6 09 mg l control to 4 65 mg l hong et al 2009 evaluated the uptake of cd and zn by radish raphanus sativa l after the application of ca oh 2 at 0 2 4 and 8 mg ha and found that both plant sorbed and nh4oac extractable cd and zn concentrations were progressively decreased with increasing ca oh 2 dosage due to the increase in cec and ph of soil lim et al 2013 investigated immobilization of cd and pb in soil using oyster shells and eggshells after 420 d of incubation the exchangeable fraction of cd evolved from 23 64 to 1 90 3 81 while the carbonate fraction increased from 19 59 to 36 66 46 36 similar trend was also observed for pb in addition the treatment also effectively reduced the tclp leachable cd and pb liming materials are often used as co amendments to enhance the sequestration of heavy metals in soil remediation wu et al 2016 combined limestone and sepiolite to remediate a pb and cd contaminated paddy soil near a mining area in southern hunan china they found that the amendment increased the soil ph by up to 1 95 units and decreased the exchangeable concentrations of pb and cd by up to 99 8 like the case of soluble phosphates the use of soluble lime has the advantage of rapid reaction rate but only limited reactive lifetime as the solution may be washed away rapidly by rainwater or along with flowing groundwater in addition immobilization through merely formation of metal oxides or hydroxides may be less durable and may subject to re dissolution when the ambient ph is re established 3 2 1 4 organic composts organic composts include biosolids and animal manure biosolids are solid residues generated during primary secondary or advanced treatments of domestic sanitary sewage conventionally biosolids applied to land are viewed as one of the major components for metal accumulation in soil advances in the treatment of sewage wastewater and separation of industrial wastewater in the sewage treatment plants have resulted in a steady decline in the metal contents of biosolids alkaline stabilized biosolid composts have been used as an effective sink for reducing the bioavailability of metals in contaminated soil and sediment basta et al 2001 demonstrated that lime stabilized biosolid greatly reduced the phytoavailability of cd and zn at smelter sites in oklahoma placek et al 2016 applied sewage sludge as an additive to soil contaminated with cd zn and pb in a field study the application of sewage sludge increased the soil ph cec and content of humic acids leading to an improved metal sorption capacity as a result the readily soluble forms of the metals and the leaching of biogenic components were reduced animal manure is another major source of valuable organic amendments the principal sources of manure are from chicken swine beef cattle dairy and poultry wastes most manure products contain low levels of heavy metals though high concentrations of cu and zn have been found in swine manure and as in poultry litter recent advances in the treatment of manure byproducts have resulted in reduced bioavailability of metals in animal manure for example 87 reduction in cu and zn in wastewater from swine houses was obtained after treatment with lime slurry ferric chloride or polymer westerman and bicudo 2000 similarly treatment of poultry manure with alum al2 so4 3 decreased the concentration of water soluble as zn cu and cd moore et al 1998 hence land applications of livestock and poultry manure byproducts are generally based on total n and p loadings while allowable trace element loadings are often the limiting factors for other biosolids manure byproducts with low contents of metals can be used as a sink for immobilizing heavy metals in soil especially for agricultural soil because of the rich nutrients li et al 2016 investigated the fractionation of cd soil biological properties and cd uptake by wheat following a chicken manure compost amendment in a cd contaminated field soil they found that the compost increased soil ph total p content and som content and enhanced soil biological properties such as microbial biomass invertase protease urease and catalase activities by up to 3 5 times moreover the treatment decreased the acid extractable cd by 8 2 37 6 and increased the reducible and oxidizable cd by 9 2 39 5 and 8 2 60 4 respectively organic amendments usually contain cellulose and lignin as the main constituents other components are extractives hemicellulose proteins lipids starches simple sugars hydrocarbons and many other compounds that contain a number of functional groups such as carbonyl phenolic acetamido groups amido amino structural polysaccharides and esters which can bind with various transition metals niazi et al 2016 in addition application of organic amendments also leads to elevated soil ph which is conducive to metal immobilization due to formation of metal hydroxides and or by preventing sulfide oxidation hydrolysis walker et al 2004 as well as increased negative surface potential gadd 2000 organic amendments are particularly attractive to remediating agricultural soil for their greenness and multitude of beneficial side effects on soil fertility moreover the increase of organic matter by organic amendments can lead to decrease of soil bulk density and increase of soil aeration due to the redistribution of soil pore space tejada et al 2006 3 2 1 5 metal oxides metal oxides such as oxides of fe mn and al with large active surface areas and the amphoteric nature have been extensively studied as metal stabilizing amendments in contaminated soil these mineral components can strongly bind metals via specific sorption co precipitation and inner sphere complexation their application is aimed to decrease the mobile bioavailable and bioaccessible fractions of metals in soil and thus minimizing leaching from soil and uptake by soil organisms plants crops and humans field tests have demonstrated the effectiveness of iron oxides e g hematite maghemite and magnetite and oxyhydroxides e g ferrihydrite goethite akaganeite lepidocrocite and feroxyhite for immobilization of various heavy metals and metalloids e g sb pb and as iron oxides were applied to immobilize as in a paddy field soil near an abandoned auag mine in korea and the amendment effectively prevented as transfer from soil to pore water and crops ko et al 2015 okkenhaug et al 2016 investigated the mobility distribution and speciation of sb and pb in a shooting range soil in south noway when treated with ferric oxyhydroxide powder cfh 12 2 coupled with limestone 1 the treatment resulted in an average decrease of sb and pb in pore water by 66 and 97 respectively which remained stable over four years leachable sb and pb were transformed to amorphous iron oxides bound or even more crystalline and residual mineral phases increasing iron oxides contents in soil can be practically achieved through the application of their precursors e g iron sulfates and elemental iron hartley and lepp 2008 warren and alloway 2003 reported that application of 1 89 w w of commercial grade feso4 resulted in 0 54 of iron oxides in treated soil however soil acidification has been cited as one of the side effects associated with this practice 3 4 f e s o 4 o 2 6 h 2 o 4 f e o o h 4 s o 4 2 8 h as the acidification could cause remobilization of metallic cations lime is often co applied to control the soil ph however addition of bicarbonate alkalinity which is commonly practiced in water coagulation should be avoided as bicarbonate is a fairly strong ligand and may complex and mobilize transition metals lewis acids the use of waste elemental iron as a precursor of iron oxides in soil has been shown to be a potentially effective and cheap amendment for decreasing the mobility and potential bioavailability of various metals in contaminated soil under field conditions elemental iron is oxidized to feooh via liu et al 2014 4 4 f e 3 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 f e o o h the surface oxide layer provides active sites for complexation of heavy metals huang et al 2016 xie et al 2016 injected dissolved fe ii and naclo into the as contaminated aquifer in the field to promote the formation of fe oxides hydroxides which can effectively oxidize as iii into as v and thus removed aqueous both as iii and as v via adsorption co precipitation and or incorporation of as v oxyanions into goethite of the various forms of manganese oxides birnessite todorokite cryptomelane and hausmannite birnessite na ca k xmn2o4 1 5h2o also known as Î´ mno2 is the most common mn oxide due to the large specific surface area and low ph of point of zero charge phpzc 1 8 4 5 dong et al 2000 feng et al 2007 it is much more efficient in adsorbing some metals especially pb compared to fe oxides equations 5 and 6 depict the adsorption of divalent metals me2 onto the amphoteric surface groups of mn oxides zaman et al 2009 5 m n o h m e 2 m n o m e h 6 2 m n o h m e 2 m n o 2 m e 2 h mccann et al 2015 applied a natural mn oxide at a dosage of 10 to immobilize pb in a historically pb contaminated soil the material demonstrated a maximum pb adsorption capacity of 346 mg g and had no adverse effect on soil microbial functioning in addition to adsorption Î´ mno2 offers remarkable oxidizing potential which can effectively convert as iii to as v an and zhao 2012 and degrade organic contaminants such as steroids and antibiotics han et al 2015 as of soil delivery most metal oxides can only be added into soil in the form of powder or granular particles through mechanical mixing which largely impedes their application to deeper soil or in situ remediation uses when soluble precursors are added the effectiveness is then limited by the shorter retention time and the lack of mixing in the subsurface to overcome these practical issues stabilized metal oxide nanoparticles such as magnetite and femn binary oxide are promising for metal immobilization due to their large specific surface area high reactivity and controllable transport in soil an and zhao 2012 liang and zhao 2014 xie et al 2015 for instance an and zhao 2012 investigated the immobilization of as iii in soil using femn binary oxide nanoparticles with cmc as a stabilizer the water leachable arsenic and the tclp leachability were reduced by 91 96 and 94 98 respectively at an fe to as molar ratio of 6 5 39 the nanoparticles demonstrated good soil deliverability and column elution tests of the contaminated soil showed that the nanoparticles transferred nearly all water soluble as iii to the nanoparticle phase the nanoparticle amendment reduced the tclp leachability of as iii remaining in the soil bed by 78 3 2 1 6 biochar biochar is a carbon rich and porous charcoal manufactured during the pyrolysis of organic residues such as municipal waste animal wastes wood crop residues and biosolids recent studies have demonstrated that biochar is able to immobilize soil heavy metals and metalloids and reduce their accumulation in plants which is often attributed to biochar s highly porous structure active functional groups elevated ph and decent cec beesley et al 2011 vithanage et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 in addition land application of biochar has been cited to improve chemical physical and biological properties of soil a number of field tests have been reported in investigating the effectiveness of biochar for soil remediation and table 2 summarizes these latest technologies bian et al 2014 conducted a three year field remediation study 2010 2012 in a cd and pb contaminated rice paddy in southern china where bioavailable cd and pb in the soil were monitored after a single soil amendment of wheat straw biochar at a dosage of 40 t ha the amendment consistently and significantly increased soil ph and total organic carbon and decreased cacl2 extractable cd by up to 70 9 and pb by up to 79 6 over the three year period as a result the total cd uptake by rice o sativa l was reduced by up to 67 3 and the total pb uptake was decreased by up to 69 0 meanwhile the rice yield was increased by 18 3 in the third year biochar amendment was found to alter the binding or speciation of cd and pb in soil cui et al 2016b reported that biochar transformed the exchangeable fractions of cd and pb into relatively more stable fractions residual and organic for instance the exchangeable fractions of cd and pb were decreased by 8 0 44 6 and 14 2 50 3 and the residual fractions were increased by 4 0 32 4 cd and 14 9 39 6 pb during five years the added affinity of heavy metals was attributed to the abundant functional groups and complex structures of biochar the contamination of cd and as in paddy soils is a serious concern in southern china however simultaneous immobilization of these co contaminants is hindered by the different geochemical behaviors of cd and as in paddy fields while application of biochar effectively immobilized cd it also facilitated as v reduction into as iii resulting in increased as toxicity and leachability in the contaminated fields chen et al 2016b vithanage et al 2017 yu et al 2018 developed a zero valent iron zvi biochar composite for simultaneous immobilization of cd and as in two paddy fields in guangdong province china from 2013 to 2015 the corrosion products of zvi demonstrated high sorption capacity for as and biochar showed high capacity for cd when applied at 2250 kg acre on a rice field the treatment reduced the accumulation of cd and as in rice by 48 and 24 respectively increasing the biochar dosage enhances the immobilization effectiveness houben et al 2013 investigated the effect of different application rates of biochar 1 5 and 10 on the fate of cd zn and pb in a contaminated soil in belgium and reported that the cacl2 exchangeable fraction of metals in soil was decreased with increasing rates of biochar after 56 days of incubation long term effectiveness and performance are important criteria to evaluate heavy metals remediation technologies shen et al 2016 conducted a field remediation treatment to examine the long term effect of biochar on the immobilization of heavy metals at a contaminated site soil ph 8 in castleford uk following the application of biochar at 0 5 2 the ni and zn concentrations in the carbonic acid leaching tests were reduced by 83 98 over three years the biochar amendment enhanced the residual fraction of ni and zn in the soil from 51 to 61 66 and from 7 to 27 35 respectively however the field trials conducted by cui et al 2016a showed that the effectiveness of the biochar decreased over time and repeated application was required for full effectiveness they observed a decrease in soil ph and an increase in bioavailability of cu and cd due to leaching of alkalinity biochar has the advantage over organic composts of having a stable fixed carbon structure and a typically high alkalinity biochar amendment makes for a multiple win scenario including carbon sequestration soil improvement i e enhanced soil capacity for retaining nutrients and water and improved soil mechanical strength agronomic benefits metal immobilization and reuse of solid waste however like the case of clay minerals the application of biochar are restricted by the limited adsorption capacity and affinity soil deliverability and reaction rate and are only suitable for shallow soil contaminated with heavy metals there is also limited information available on the long term stability of metals immobilized at the field scale in addition the biochar s effectiveness depends on various factors including metal type immobilization time site specific factors e g climate biochar dosage and mixing depth biochar feedstock type and biochar properties 3 2 2 solidification stabilization solidification stabilization s s also referred to as waste fixation has been widely adopted to amend heavy metals contaminated soil due to its relatively low cost and easy implementation soil solidification is a process that encapsulates the waste materials in a monolithic solid of high structural integrity khan et al 2004 in contrast soil stabilization refers to a process of amending contaminated soil with chemical reagents to convert leachable chemicals to physically and chemically more stable forms it often involves chemical interactions between the target heavy metals and the binding agents chen et al 2009 the objectives of s s are to achieve and maintain the desired physical properties and to chemically stabilize or permanently sequestrate contaminants in the solid phase thereby preventing the chemicals from harming the environment or biota a good binder plays a decisive role in the remediation effectiveness of s s processes cement based binders are commonly used for implementation of s s technologies in the field a field study conducted by wang et al 2014a demonstrated excellent efficacy of cement based binders in remediating metals contaminated soil at a site in west drayton after 17 years of the remediation the tclp leachable concentrations of cu ni zn pb and cd remained below the private water supplies regulations england 2009 antemir et al 2010 evaluated the field performance of cement based s s techniques at a former fireworks and low explosives manufacturing site in england after four years of operation the results indicated that the treated soil was progressively carbonated over time and that pb zn and cu were adequately immobilized calcium aluminate cement cac has received increasing attention as an alternative binder navarro blasco et al 2013 studied the adsorption capacities of cac for pb zn and cu and found that the total uptake could reach up to 3 wt voglar and lestan 2013 used cac and sulfate resistant portland cement src as binders for immobilizing zn pb cu as cd and ni in soil at a brownfield site in slovenia they reported that the cac treatment produced s s soil monoliths of higher mechanical strength up to 7 65 n mm2 and reduced the leachability of zn pb cu as cd and ni more effectively than src blending novel binders and additives e g magnesia and zeolites with the conventional binders is expected to provide added benefits due to their individual credentials in improving the overall s s effectiveness wang et al 2015 evaluated the performance of various binders including portland cement pc ground granulated blast furnace slag ggbs pulverized fuel ash pfa mgo and zeolite for in situ s s field trials at a site contaminated with complex heavy metals e g pb zn cr cu and ni and organic chemicals in the uk s s was implemented using a triple auger system where soil was mixed to a depth of 4 m at various contaminant and binder levels unconfined compressive strength ucs values were 22 3476 kpa and the leachability of the heavy metals in contaminated soil was in the range of 0 002 0 225 mg l based on the batch leaching procedures of bs en 12457 2 the combination of ggbs and mgo at a ratio of 9 1 demonstrated a higher material strength and better immobilization efficiency for heavy metals wang et al 2016 further evaluated the physical and chemical performance of mgo bearing binders for immobilizing heavy metals in contaminated soil over three years after the treatment the results showed that mgo ggbs blends provided higher strength and less leachability of heavy metals compared to pc or mgo alone s s has been considered as one of the most efficient and low risk remediation methods it has several main advantages including relatively low cost easy to implement enhanced soil comprehensive strength high resistance to biodegradation and broad engineering applicability however the metals are not removed from soil and further long term monitoring of heavy metals on site are required the longevity of the s s materials is also questionable moreover this technology usually results in a volume increase in treated media 3 2 3 soil washing soil washing refers to leaching of heavy metals from soil matrix with various reagents or extractants such as water inorganic acids organic acids chelating agents and surfactants typically contaminated soil is dug out and mixed with a suitable extractant solution for a specified time depending on the type of metals and soil the extractant can transfer heavy metals from soil to the liquid phase via chemical dissolution ion exchange chelation or desorption ferraro et al 2015 the treated soil upon regulatory permission is then backfilled to the original sites barring the cost soil washing permanently removes metal contaminants from soil and is a rapid method that can fulfill the remediation goals without any long term liability park and son 2017 a variety of chelators have been tested for soil washing at the field scale edta is the most frequently reported chelating agent due to its strong chelating ability for various heavy metals hu et al 2014 assessed the metal removal efficiency of edta from soil contaminated with cd cu pb and zn the on site metal removal efficiencies were determined to be 80 69 73 and 62 for cd cu pb and zn respectively however there is a growing environmental concern about edta washing because of its poor biodegradability and high persistence in the soil environment which might result in deterioration of soil functions wang et al 2018 employed four biodegradable chelators namely iminodisuccinic acid isa glutamate n n diacetic acid glda glucomonocarbonic acid gca and polyaspartic acid pasp for extracting heavy metals from field contaminated soils collected at a lead zinc contaminated mining wasteland and from a farmland near a non ferrous metal smelter in china the removal of cd pb and zn reached 45 53 and 32 respectively for the mining soil and 85 55 and 64 for the farmland soil moreover the leachability mobility and bioaccessibility of the residual metals after the washing processes were decreased notably compared to the original soil other washing chemicals include salt and high concentrations of chloride solution such as calcium chloride and iron iii chloride guo et al 2016 nagai et al 2012 showed that on site soil washing with fecl3 was able to effectively remove cd in paddy soil the acid soluble cd concentrations in the washed soil extracted with 0 1 m hcl decreased by 47 compared to the untreated soil phosphate solutions can be applied to specifically extract arsenate from soils due to their structural similarity i e tetrahedral oxyanions of phosphate ions po4 3 and arsenate ions aso4 3 jho et al 2015 reported that soil washing with a 0 5 m phosphate solution for 2 h removed 24 5 of as from an as contaminated soil at a former smelter site soil washing is one of the few permanent treatment alternatives to remove heavy metals or metalloids from soil it is rapid highly effective and may allow recovery of the metals in certain cases it markedly reduces the volume of treated soil and the processed soil may be returned to the site however for field scale applications this technology bears with several disadvantages 1 the treated soil may be inappropriate for revegetation due to the deterioration of soil properties and the loss of nutrients and som 2 the presence of chemical agents in the treated soil may cause potential adverse effects 3 the wastewater produced must be further handled or treated which can be quite costly and 4 it only removes the extractable fractions of the contaminants and the degree of removal depends on the chemical agents used development of low cost and green flushing extractants will help to address these concerns 3 3 biological remediation biological remediation is one of the most environmentally friendly options to rectify and re establish the natural conditions of contaminated soil it makes use of microorganisms plants non viable or viable natural or genetically engineered to detoxify or remove heavy metals from the soil and to improve soil quality and restore soil function ye et al 2017a 2017b while it may take a long remediation time it is usually rather cost effective and non invasive and may be used to enhance natural attenuation processes 3 3 1 phytoremediation phytoremediation is a technology that utilizes specialty living plants to fix or adsorb contaminants to remove the contaminants from soil or reduce their environmental impacts and thereby remediating and revegetating contaminated soil it is considered to be an environment friendly attractive aesthetically pleasant non invasive energy efficient and cost effective technology to clean up sites with low to moderate levels of heavy metals the modern technologies of phytoremediation are based on different uptake mechanisms which include phytostabilization phytoextraction and phytovolatilization fig 1 phytostabilization or phytoimmobilization is the use of plants with ability to decrease the mobility or and bioavailability of contaminants via certain mechanisms including adsorption by roots chemical precipitation and complexation in the root zone to this end long living plants such as poplar trees are often employed cheng et al 2016 investigated the feasibility of phytoremediation using miscanthus floridulus with high dry matter yields and a strong vitality on a fallow land contaminated with high concentrations of lead up to 6000 mg kg after one year the lead content in the roots reached 806 7 mg kg and the plant immobilized 1 13 kg ha year of lead from the soil it should be noted that phytostabilization is only effective for a limited depth to the extent the roots can reach and the heavy metals remain in the soil or plants which may need to be monitored regularly or further treated phytoextraction also known as phytoaccumulation phytoabsorption or phytosequestration refers to the uptake of contaminants from soil by plant roots and their translocation and accumulation in the aboveground biomass i e shoots metal translocation to shoots is a crucial biochemical process desirable for effective phytoextraction since the harvest of the root biomass is generally not feasible yang et al 2017 conducted a field study to evaluate the heavy metal phytoextraction potential of the as hyperaccumulator pteris vittata l and the castor bean ricinus communis l in a co planting system where soil was contaminated with as cd and pb they showed that the co planting significantly increased the yield of p vittata and the uptake of as and pb by p vittata the addition of water soluble chitosan further enhanced the uptake of cd and pb by p vittata and r communis phytovolatilization is an approach that involves the uptake and transpiration of metals into their volatile forms and their release into the atmosphere through stomata this technique is primarily useful for hg where mercuric ions are transformed into relatively less toxic elemental form because the volatile form of hg released into the atmosphere may be recycled back to the soil by precipitation this technique presents a temporary solution of the problem in practice phytovolatilization of mercury is considered as a natural consequence of the interaction between plant species with mercury in soil leonard et al 1998 studied mercury exchange flux between aerial parts of five plant species lepidium latifolium artemisia douglasiana caulanthus sp fragaria vesca eucalyptus globulus grown on a hg contaminated soil 450 1605 mg kg and air in a glasshouse at 30 5 c in the daytime the plant to atmosphere emission of mercury was in the range of 10 93 ng m2 h and caulanthus sp demonstrated the highest mercury emission rate for all the plant species emissions in the dark were an order of magnitude less than that during the daytime mercury volatilization through the stomata accounted for 90 of the total mercury emission phytoremediation has been considered to be an attractive option for remediation of soil with low to moderate levels of metal pollution however it typically takes a lengthy remediation period the efficiency is generally restricted by the low biomass and slow growth rate of metal hyperaccumulator plants and the metals enriched biomass may need further handling and disposal moreover some hyper accumulating species may be invasive and thus subject to regulatory restrictions lastly sustainable phytoremediation depends on the climatic and weather conditions 3 3 2 microbial remediation microbial remediation refers to the process of using microorganisms i e bacteria fungi and algae to induce the adsorption precipitation oxidation and reduction of heavy metals or metalloids in soil thereby lowering the availabilities of the contaminants the microorganisms may be indigenous to a contaminated area or may be isolated from elsewhere in practice contaminated soil is inoculated with selected microorganisms by spray irrigation or infiltration galleries injection wells may be applied if the contaminants are deep in soil typical microbial remediation techniques include biosorption bioprecipitation bioleaching biotransformation and biovolatilization biosorption is a process that involves trapping of heavy metals via the cellular structure of a microorganism and subsequently sorption onto the binding sites of the cell wall the microbial cell wall consisting of polysaccharides lipids and proteins offers many functional groups including carboxylate hydroxyl amino and phosphate groups that can bind heavy metals extracellular polymeric substances eps or exopolysaccharides secreted by microorganisms have been reported to act as surface active agents for binding with heavy metals wang et al 2014b applied a mutant species b38 from the wild type of bacillus subtilis under uv irradiation together with a bio fertilizer novogro ng for remediation of farmland soil contaminated with cd cr hg and pb in tianjin china they demonstrated that b38 was an effective biosorbent for the heavy metals and the co amendment of b38 and ng reduced the heavy metal contents in the edible part of radish by 30 8 96 0 bioprecipitation describes the transformation of soluble species of heavy metals or metalloids into insoluble hydroxides carbonates phosphates and sulfides through microbial metabolism researchers have reported the role of sulfate reducing bacteria srb in immobilizing heavy metals by generating sulfides vitor et al 2015 zhang and wang 2016 groudev et al 2014 investigated the effect of srb biostimulation on the mobility of cd cu and zn from an acidic leached cinnamonic forest soil under field conditions and found that the metals were precipitated as the insoluble sulfides as a result of the activity of the indigenous srb inhabiting in the soil subhorizon 30 50 cm bioleaching refers to the dissolution of metallic minerals and the release of associated metals via microorganism activity the microorganisms used mainly include chemoautotrophic bacteria and fungi such as leptospirillum ferrooxidans acidithiobacillus thiooxidans acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and aspergillus niger the well known fe s oxidizing bacteria thiobacillus and leptospirillum ferrooxidans can oxidize iron and sulfide producing sulfuric acid and releasing associated heavy metals akcil et al 2015 nguyen and lee 2015 found that as cu fe mn and zn were removed by 42 4 45 0 47 7 92 and 67 2 respectively in mine tailings using a mixed culture of acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans after 500 h at 0 5 elemental sulfur concentration zeng et al 2015 reported that aspergillus niger strain sy1 effectively removed pb cd cu and zn from contaminated sediment by up to 99 5 56 0 71 9 and 76 4 biotransformation e g methylation reduction and dealkylation oxidation can change the chemical form of heavy metals and thus altering their mobility toxicity and bioavailability it is particularly applicable to heavy metals whose toxicity varies with different oxidation states for instance the mercury resistant bacteria organomercurial lyase converts methyl mercury to hg ii which is one hundred fold less toxic than methyl mercury wu et al 2010 direct enzymatic reduction through metal reducing microorganism can reduce soluble and mobile cr vi into insoluble and immobile cr iii jobby et al 2018 tapase and kodam 2018 isolated an arsenic oxidizing Î± proteobacterial strain microvirga indica s mi1b sp nov from a heavy metal contaminated soil and found that the strain possessed arsenite oxidase gene and completely oxidized 15 mm as iii to as v within 39 h this approach may be extended to immobilization of many other redox active contaminants such as se u and tc however cautions should be exercised to avoid converting less mobile or less toxic forms of metals or metalloids into more mobile or more toxic forms biovolatilization involves turning a soluble contaminant into its volatile state for metals or metalloids this technique is only applicable to se and hg wu et al 2010 chen et al 2018 tan et al 2016 for instance mercury resistant bacteria can utilize the mera enzyme to reduce hg ii to the volatile form hg 0 wu et al 2010 chen et al 2018 tested a two stage system chemical extraction followed by microbial reduction for removal of hg from field contaminated soils they found that 77 of hg was extracted from the soils after the first step extraction process with 0 5 m ammonium thiosulfate and up to 81 of hg2 was transformed from the washing solution through the biotransformation of hg reducing bacteria enterobacter cloacae microbial remediation has been considered as a safe easy and effective technology it has the advantages of low energy requirement low operation cost no environmental and health hazards and possibility of recovering heavy metals it is a natural process and is therefore perceived by the public as an acceptable treatment process yet microbial remediation is effective only when environmental conditions permit the desired microbial growth and activity additional nutrients oxygen and other amendments are usually required to stimulate microbial activity and enhance the bioremediation process the process is usually slow and time consuming and it is often needed to combine bioremediation with physical chemical approaches to speed up the remediation process and boost the efficiency 3 3 3 microbial assisted phytoremediation the rhizosphere is an important habitat for microorganisms including bacteria fungi algae and protozoa the efficiency of phytoremediation can be enhanced by assistance of plant growth promoting pgp bacteria including serratia bacillus pseudomonas burkholderia enterobacter erwinia klebsiella beijerinckia flavobacterium and gluconacetobacter babu et al 2013 sheng et al 2008 tak et al 2013 the enhancement can be achieved in several ways first these bacteria have the ability to affect heavy metals mobility and availability to the plant and they can transform heavy metals into bioavailable and soluble forms through the action of siderophores organic acids biosurfactants biomethylation and redox processes facilitating plant uptake of the soil bound metals the bacteria have developed various metal tolerance mechanisms including exclusion biosorption active removal precipitation or bioaccumulation in both external and intracellular spaces rajkumar et al 2009 in addition enzymatic detoxification represents another metal resistance mechanism e g bio reduction of hg ii into hg 0 second pgp bacteria possess several growth promoting capabilities including phosphorus solubilization nitrogen fixation iron sequestration and phytohormone and acc 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid deaminase synthesis li and ramakrishna 2011 which can improve plant growth increase plant biomass and in turn assist phytoremediation for instance jiang et al 2008 isolated a heavy metal resistant bacterial strain identified as burkholderia sp j62 from a heavy metal contaminated soil and applied to a field contaminated soil with pb and cd the isolate increased bacterial solubilization of both metals in both solution culture and in soil with production of indole acetic acid siderophore and 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylate deaminase and also dissolution of inorganic phosphate moreover the treatment significantly improved the biomass of maize and tomato plants and enhanced the accumulation of pb and cu in the plant tissues babu et al 2013 reported that inoculating soil with the bacterial strain isolated from roots of pinus sylvestris significantly increased biomass chlorophyll content nodule number and accumulation of heavy metals as cu pb ni and zn in the hyperaccumulator alnus firma seedlings 3 4 combined remediation combined remediation involves applications of two or more physical chemical and or biological remediation technologies it supplements the limitations with individual technology alone and takes advantage of different techniques to enhance the remediation efficiency combined remediation methods such as chemically assisted phytoextraction wang et al 2011 electrokinetic remediation coupled with complexing agents robles et al 2012 electrokinetic remediation combined with phytoextraction mao et al 2016 citric acid facilitated thermal treatment ma et al 2015 soil washing coupled with chemical stabilization zhai et al 2018 chemical stabilization and phytoremediation fellet et al 2014 have attracted a lot of attention for instance wang et al 2011 investigated mercury uptake by plant chenopodium glaucum l growing on a mercury contaminated soil and observed that addition of ammonium thiosulphate a sulfur containing ligand significantly increased the solubility of mercury and thereby enhanced the mercury uptake robles et al 2012 demonstrated that complexing agents such as edta can facilitate mercury removal from mining soils in querÃ©taro mexico in an electrokinetic remediation process up to 75 of hg was removed by wetting the soil with 0 1 m edta and after 6 h of electrokinetic treatment the enhanced efficacy was attributed to increased electromigration of the edta hg complexes ma et al 2015 combined citric acid and thermal treatment to enhance hg removal from a farmland soil in guizhou province china at a citric acid hg molar ratio of 15 the mercury level in soil was reduced from 134 to 1 1 mg kg upon treatment at 400 c for 1 h with an estimated reduction of energy input by 35 the addition of citric acid enhanced the volatilization of mercury by providing an acidic environmental condition wu et al 2017 reported that combining biochar amendment and composting is an attractive remediation technology the interaction of biochar and composts boosted the nutrients cec functional groups and organic matter on the biochar and increased the nutrients cec organic matter and microbial activities of the composts these favorable modifications are expected to improve the efficiencies for soil amendment and remediation 4 economic considerations physical remediation methods generally require large amounts of manpower and material resources whereas chemical approaches require a larger cost share for chemicals or reagents in general chemical approaches are more cost effective than physical remediation under similar remediation goals especially for deeper soil and where only low dosages of immobilizing agents or chemical extractants are needed bioremediation is more economical and greener than physical chemical approaches but its uses are confined by the reachability of biota and technical effectiveness us epa 2004 reported that the total for phytoremediation ranged from us 25 to 100 per ton of soil compared to 300 500 ton for vitrification and 75 210 ton for soil washing frtr 2007 reported a cost range of 50 117 m3 for electrokinetic remediation and 33 32 m3 for soil washing martin and ruby 2004 estimated a cost of 40 65 m3 for in situ chemical stabilization chang and yen 2006 estimated a cost of us 834 m3 for a full scale thermal desorption process 750 c for 3 h to treat mercury contaminated soil 5 concluding remarks and future research needs soil contamination by heavy metals has been a worldwide challenge and remediation technologies have come a long way over the past decade or so this review presents the latest development and knowledge on the general principles and effectiveness of key remediation techniques that have been studied or demonstrated at the field scale in general physical remediation methods can remove heavy metals metalloids from contaminated soil groundwater eliminating long term effects and are effective for highly contaminated sites with multiple heavy metals metalloids however these methods are highly costly environmentally destructive and only applicable to small contaminated volume where the contaminants are readily accessible chemical methods are rapid simple easy to apply relatively economical and may be used for in situ remediation however chemical stabilization techniques do not remove the contaminants from the media and long term monitoring is needed biological methods are environmentally friendly safe least destructive and cost efficient however biological processes are often time consuming and only effective for low to moderate levels of heavy metals metalloids combined remediation methods may overcome the limitations of single technology alone but require complex operating conditions as technology continues to evolve it is generally agreed that the adopted method should not only have a remarkable effect on reducing the amount bioavailability and toxicity of the contaminants but also cause minimal disturbance to the natural environment or local ecological systems the ecological impact should be considered in the establishment of remediation goals and environmental criteria in addition this review reveals the following key knowledge gaps and practical challenges which should be addressed to advance the remediation technology 1 the remediation criteria have shown a trend to shift from reducing the total concentration of the contaminants to lowering the fraction that is more leachable or bioavailable given the often inhibitive cost for removing total heavy metals from soil treating the more risky fraction of the contaminants appears more practical however careful monitoring the residual metals in the soil is needed especially at sites that are subject to significant perturbation in biogeochemical conditions 2 while the immobilization or stabilization approaches have been increasingly accepted in soil remediation practices it is important to know whether immobilized metals are reversible and stable under natural and disturbed conditions long term years to decades field experiments are needed to evaluate the stability and remobilization of the immobilized contaminants while remediation companies are often held responsible for long term stability of the immobilized metals a mechanism for long term monitoring and liability for completed sites has been lacking as a result field data have been rare or lacking on the long term effectiveness of the remediation practices 3 it is highly desired to further investigate the molecular level reaction mechanisms that govern the heavy metal metalloid speciation and mobility such information may aid in development of mechanism based models to predict long term stability or mobility of metals under various environmental conditions in addition the information can provide sound scientific basis for improvement of current remediation techniques 4 it has been a rule rather than exception that soil and groundwater are polluted with multiple pollutants including metals metalloids and organic chemicals there is a need to understand the impact of soil amendments on the stability of co contaminants cautions should be exercised in the remediation process to minimize disturbance to the local biogeochemical conditions and to avoid mobilization of other co contaminants for example addition of phosphate compounds to soil may mobilize arsenate 5 the effects of soil amendments on soil properties and soil groundwater biogeochemical conditions should be measured at the field scale field studies should also determine bioavailability phytotoxicity and ecoreceptor endpoints to show reduction of risks conversely the environmental fate of the amending agents in the soil should be followed under field conditions 6 there is an urgent need for technologies suitable for remediating agricultural land contaminated with metals metalloids especially when active farming is practiced as well as sites located in residential areas or soil in deep aquifers 7 further studies are needed to develop and test mechanistically sound models to predict the adsorption reaction rates desorption kinetics and chemical speciation under field biogeochemical conditions such models are useful to gauge the effectiveness of the technology and to assess the long term stability of immobilized heavy metals 8 as remediation practices are increasingly constrained by complex factors that are beyond the conventional cost effectiveness a systematic life cycle analysis method is needed to take into account technical economic and sustainability issues in assessing field

19229,soil contamination by heavy metals and metalloids has been a major concern to human health and environmental quality while many remediation technologies have been tested at the bench scale there have been only limited reports at the field scale this paper aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the field applications of various soil remediation technologies performed over the last decade or so under the general categories of physical chemical and biological approaches ten remediation techniques were critically reviewed the technical feasibility and economic effectiveness were evaluated and the pros and cons were appraised in addition attention was placed to the environmental impacts of the remediation practices and long term stability of the contaminants which should be taken into account in the establishment of remediation goals and environmental criteria moreover key knowledge gaps and practical challenges are identified graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy

with a host of heavy metals and metalloids such as chromium cr arsenic as cadmium cd copper cu mercury hg lead pb selenium se zinc zn and nickel ni there have been over 10 million major contaminated sites worldwide of which more than 50 were contaminated with heavy metals and or metalloids khalid et al 2016 in the u s around 600 000 ha of land especially at the brown field sites have been found contaminated with heavy metals and the u s environmental protection agency epa has designated more than 50 000 heavy metals polluted sites as the national priority sites which require urgent remediation actions ensley 2000 in china the average contents of cd hg as cu pb cr zn and ni in soil have been found to have exceeded the regulation levels by 7 0 1 6 2 7 2 1 1 5 1 1 0 9 and 4 8 respectively according to the ministry of environmental protection and ministry of land and resources of china bulletin on natural survey of soil contamination in 2014 heavy metals and metalloids have been a major threat to human and environmental health due to their non biodegradability toxicity persistence and bioaccumulation in the food chain they have been found responsible for causing various disorders in humans including cardiovascular diseases cancer cognitive impairment chronic anemia and damage of kidneys nervous system brain skin and bones jÃ¤rup 2003 for instance exposure to lead has been associated with improper hemoglobin synthesis and tumor infection elevated blood pressure and dysfunction of reproductive system pourrut et al 2011 consequently it is imperative to develop and deploy innovative and site specific remediation technologies for efficient clean up of heavy metals or metalloids contaminated sites to remediate soil contaminated with heavy metals or metalloids many studies have been carried out at the bench scale and under well controlled conditions ye et al 2017a 2017b however due to the complexity of the actual soil biogeochemical conditions the technical effectiveness and feasibility can greatly deviate from laboratory results in addition many practical issues such as material deliverability soil phase mass transfer and reaction rates impacts of delivered chemicals on the local biogeochemical conditions and the long term stabilities of immobilized contaminants remain to be addressed through systematic field scale studies and long term monitoring under real world environmental conditions over the last decade or so various physical chemical and biological processes have been aimed at reducing the total concentrations and or bioavailable fractions of heavy metals or metalloids in order to mitigate the subsequent accumulation along the food chain bhargava et al 2012 fig 1 to reduce the total contaminant mass in soil a number of remediation methods have been practiced including soil replacement douay et al 2008 electrokinetic removal giannis et al 2009 thermal treatment busto et al 2011 soil washing hu et al 2014 and phytoextraction mahar et al 2016 on the other hand to mitigate bioavailability or bioaccumulation various chemical immobilization techniques are often employed using a range of chemical compounds such as lime wu et al 2016 phosphate compounds qayyum et al 2017 sun et al 2018 and organic compounds basta et al 2001 li et al 2016 placek et al 2016 in addition vitrification mallampati et al 2015 solidification stabilization wang et al 2014a and phytostabilization cheng et al 2016 have also been investigated at the field however most of the field cleanup actions are often practiced by remediation industries as a result information is often less systematic or long term monitoring of completed site is lacking in addition the environmental impacts of the remediation practices are often ignored to our knowledge most documents and reviews on the heavy metal remediation technologies have been focused on lab scale results khalid et al 2016 yao et al 2012 bolan et al 2014 reviewed some remediation technologies focusing on laboratory and greenhouse studies using a various mobilizing and immobilizing soil amendments with four field case studies on soil washing and chemical stabilization methods yet comprehensive reviews on field scale applications have been very limited over the last decade or so consequently a thorough review is needed to connect the dots and to synthesize the information in order to evaluate the state of the technology and identify future research needs the main purpose of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of the remediation practices performed under field conditions for remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals and or metalloids specifically the review aimed to 1 evaluate the technical effectiveness of various remediation technologies that have been applied at the field scale 2 elucidate the underlying technical principles 3 assess the technical applicability limitations ecological impacts and cost effectiveness and 4 identify critical knowledge gaps and future research needs this review will provide useful information for both the industries and scientific research community to develop innovative remediation technologies and for site managers to adopt the most suitable remediation techniques under specific site conditions 2 sources and chemical speciation of heavy metals and metalloids and regulatory trend both natural and anthropogenic sources can lead to serious soil contamination by metals metalloids although the latter is often blamed to be the culprit in the modern time natural sources may include geological breakdown of parent rock materials and volcanic eruptions the earth crust is composed of 95 of ingenious rocks and 5 of sedimentary rocks thornton 1981 typically basaltic ingenious rocks contain high concentrations of co cd zn cu and ni whereas shales contain large amounts of zn cu mn cd and pb khalid et al 2016 in soil groundwater systems these heavy metals exist as carbonates sulfides oxides or salts anthropogenic sources are primarily associated with refining and mining of ores batteries paper industries tanneries fertilizer and pesticides industries biosolids application wastewater irrigation and atmospheric depositions and combustion of fossil fuels mahar et al 2016 heavy metals can be released in inorganic organic and or elemental forms ross 1994 divided the anthropogenic sources of heavy metals into five groups namely 1 agricultural zn as pb cd cu se and u 2 metalliferous mining and smelting cd pb as and hg 3 industrial cd hg as cr cu co ni and zn 4 waste disposal as pb cu cd cr zn and hg and 5 atmospheric deposition as pb cr hg cu cd and u heavy metals can be bound to various compartments in soil namely amorphous materials clay surfaces or iron manganese oxyhydroxides lattice of secondary minerals like carbonates sulfates or oxides organic matter or lattice of primary minerals such as silicates tessier et al 1979 yu et al 2001 because soil adsorption or solid phase speciation can greatly impact the mobility and availabilities of metals metalloids it has been increasingly recognized that the toxicity and reactivity are often governed by the available fraction of the contaminants rather than the total contaminant concentration namely specific chemical speciation of metals metalloids nyamangara 1998 as well as interactions with various soil components including soil organic matter som should be taken into account in establishing remediation goals to determine the relative availabilities of metals metalloids in soil various sequential extraction procedures seps are often employed guevara riba et al 2004 these operationally defined methodologies use a series of selective extracting reagents to successively dissolve different fractions of metals metalloids that are bound with various fractions of mineralogical components gleyzes et al 2002 for instance the sep by tessier et al 1979 operationally divides soil bound heavy metals into five geochemical forms i e water soluble and exchangeable carbonate bound iron and manganese oxide associated organic matter bound and residual forms the water soluble and exchangeable fractions are considered to be the most available components and the fractions bound to carbonate oxide and organic matter are supposed to represent the potentially bioavailable components under changing conditions whereas the residual fraction represents the most stable form associated with anthropogenic or geogenic components which is considered unavailable to plants or microorganisms from a soil remediation standpoint the general trend has been shifting from reduction of the total concentration to reduction of the physic chemically and or biologically available fractions of metals this regulatory shift represents a tremendous saving in remediation cost while metals are not degradable their speciation and binding with soil may be manipulated through various amending reagents or materials thereby reducing their solubility mobility and bioavailability accordingly remediation goals are often based on leachabilities of soil sorbed metals metalloids for instance the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp epa method 1311 has been widely used in the u s and many other countries to gauge remediation effectiveness or identify hazardous materials where the thresholds are often set at 100 times the corresponding maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water in china sulfuric acid and nitric acid method hj t299 2007 has been used in measuring the degree of success in remediation of metals metalloids contaminated soil 3 field scale remediation technologies depending on the type of heavy metals metalloids and site characteristics different remediation technologies may be applied table 1 summarizes the most commonly used physical chemical and biological processes given the complex nature of soil biogeochemical conditions and the distribution of contaminants various remediation approaches are often combined to achieve the remediation goals 3 1 physical remediation 3 1 1 soil replacement soil replacement relies on the use of non contaminated soil to replace or partly replace the contaminated soil aiming to dilute the heavy metal contents in soil to increase the soil environmental capacity and thus remediate the soil derakhshan nejad et al 2017 prior to 1984 excavation off site disposal and soil replacement were the most commonly methods for cleaning up contaminated sites douay et al 2008 carried out soil replacement remediation at three kitchen gardens garden 1 2 and 3 situated less than 1 km from the metaleurop nord smelter in northern france the sites were contaminated with high concentrations of pb and cd up to 3300 and 24 mg kg respectively in the top soil they delineated a surface area of 80 m2 for garden 1 50 m2 for garden 2 and 100 m2 for garden 3 and replaced 28 m3 17 5 m3 and 40 m3 of the contaminated soil with a local clean soil respectively after the soil replacement cultivation of vegetables showed a clear improvement of vegetables cd and pb levels in radish leaves were reduced from 26 2 mg kg and 41 2 mg kg to 3 0 mg kg and 8 4 mg kg respectively after the remediation action the replaced contaminated soil was exported to metaleurop nord for the use of slag heap coverage this technique is costly due to intensive labor and is feasible for small volumes of heavily polluted shallow soil in small area in addition the removed contaminated soil often falls into the category of hazardous wastes demanding costly further handling and disposal it may not be applicable to agricultural sites which are characterized of large volume of soil and low concentration of contaminants due to the associated high cost and potential loss of soil fertility and may be limited by the availability of the clean replacement soil 3 1 2 vitrification vitrification is a high temperature process in which organic matter is incinerated and mineral matter is melted leading to the sequestration of metals metalloids in a small volume of vitreous material mallampati et al 2015 vitrification can be applied both in situ and above ground in a treatment unit ex situ two primary heat sources include thermal energy by using combustion of fossil fuels and electrical energy through the joule effect electric arc induction or plasma processes colombo et al 2003 during vitrification some metal species such as hg may be volatilized which may be subject to regulatory constraints and require additional handling and treatment dellisanti et al 2009 carried out an in field joule heating vitrification of tons of zn and pb rich ceramic waste fig 2 they reported that heating the waste up to about 1850 c completely melted the waste material and the rapid cooling formed a monolithic glassified material of 55 tons which effectively immobilized the heavy metals and non volatile inorganic compounds wang et al 2008a conducted a pilot scale experiment to treat a fly ash from a municipal solid waste incinerator using a diesel oil furnace for more than six months they observed that the residual levels of stabilized heavy metals cd cr cu pb and zn in the melted slag followed the order of cr zn cu cd pb and that the tclp leachable concentrations of all the heavy metals were far below the regulatory values temperature is the key factor in terms of both immobilization effectives and process cost while traditional fuel based or electrical heating is often cost prohibitive recent solar technology may facilitate remarkable energy saving for example navarro et al 2013 investigated the vitrification of hazardous mine wastes and mine tailing from old mercury and agpb mines in spain using solar technology and observed successful immobilization of fe mn ni cu and zn at 1350 c in addition the electrical conductivity of the target soil waste may limit the effectiveness as soil vitrification involves insertion of electrodes into the soil it is critical for the medium to be able to carry electrical current thus a main limitation of in situ vitrification is the potential of the soil to melt so that current can pass through it soil containing high alkali e g 1 4 wt may not be a good conductor buelt and thompson 1992 therefore in situ vitrification can be performed only for wet soil with low alkali content this technique can be applied for small scale remediation of heavily polluted sites it permanently remediates the soil with long term effectiveness and much reduced waste volume and may produce products with potential reuse options however under field conditions or at large scale this technique can be highly expensive 3 1 3 electrokinetic remediation electrokinetic remediation is a new and effective physical method for remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals or metalloids as depicted in fig 3 this technique relies on an electric field gradient of suitable intensity that is established across an electrolytic tank containing saturated soil the electrodes are generally immersed into constructed wells containing an electrolytic solution under the electric field the target metal ions migrate towards the oppositely charged electrodes the contaminants accumulated at the electrodes are then treated with various physical chemical approaches including electroplating precipitation co precipitation pump and treat the water near the electrodes or sorption with ion exchange resins reddy et al 2001 rosestolato et al 2015 carried out a field scale project on electrokinetic remediation of 400 kg of a mercury contaminated soil and found that about 60 of total hg was removed in less than 3 months kim et al 2012 applied an in situ electrokinetic technique to clean up multiple metals metalloids in a contaminated rice field and they observed that 39 8 17 2 and 19 4 of as cu and pb respectively were removed after 4 weeks of the treatment earlier kim et al 2011 carried out a pilot scale electrokinetic test and achieved 96 8 removal of uranium from a uranium contaminated soil after 25 days the main mechanisms of electrokinetic remediation include electrophoresis movement of charged particles electric seepage or electro migration movement of charged chemicals electro osmosis fluid movement and electrolysis redox reactions induced by the electric current yao et al 2012 electro migration is one to two orders of magnitude faster than the other mechanisms and thus is the dominant mass transfer mechanism for heavy metals metalloids virkutyte et al 2002 electrolysis of water is the dominant electron transfer reaction occurring at electrodes during the electrokinetic process 1 h 2 o 2 h 1 2 o 2 g 2 e a n o d e 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 oh h 2 g c a t h o d e the h ions produced at the anode decrease the local ph which is conducive to desorption of metallic cations from the soil phase because of the elevated competition of h ions and more positive soil surface potential and adsorption of oxyanions such as arsenate conversely oh ions at the cathode cause an increase of ph which is in favor of soil adsorption of heavy metals or formation of precipitates as hydroxides and oxyhydroxides in addition the h ions at the anode may migrate through the soil towards the cathode whereas the oh ions migrate towards the anode depending on the extent of migration of h and oh ph may vary across the soil the high ph region in the proximity to the cathode is the main obstacle to heavy metal removal from the soil to improve the effectiveness surfactants e g tween 80 tween 20 and rhamnolipid biosurfactant and complexing agents e g humic substances citric acid ammonium acetate nitrilotriacetic acid diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid and ethyleneglycol tetraacetic acid have been applied alcÃ¡ntara et al 2012 ammami et al 2015 bahemmat et al 2016 chen et al 2011 falciglia et al 2016 fu et al 2017 giannis et al 2009 maturi et al 2009 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta is a strong metal complexing agent that can extract and enhance the mobility of heavy metals from soil hanay et al 2009 and has been applied successfully in the field jeon et al 2015 remediated a paddy rice soil contaminated with pb and cu via an in situ electrokinetic process using edta as an electrolyte to enhance the metals extraction the negatively charged metal edta complexes were transported towards the anode as a result 40 3 of cu and 46 6 of pb were removed from the soil after 24 weeks of operation electrokinetic remediation is also used in combination with other processes such as microbial process lee and kim 2010 phytoremediation cameselle et al 2013b and permeable reactive barriers prbs zhao et al 2016 chung 2009 combined electrokinetic treatment with prb to remediate a cu contaminated site the perforated cathode pile was filled with reactive materials consequently the migrating cu2 ions in the soil were adsorbed at the cathode after 30 days of operation the cu removal reached 68 7 93 7 75 0 88 0 and 4 7 respectively when iron powder zeolite slag powder tire chip and sand were used the advantages of electrokinetic remediation include 1 it produces no or little by products 2 it is easy to install and operate and effective for soil with low permeability 3 it does not abolish the original nature of the soil and 4 the treatment duration is relatively short however this technique bears with some critical drawbacks including 1 it is only applicable for saturated soil with low groundwater flow 2 it only removes a part of leachable metals metalloids 3 it is less effective for heterogeneous soil 4 the energy cost can be prohibitive especially when higher removal is required and 5 the application of the electrical field may cause fluctuation in soil ph or significant alteration in local biogeochemical conditions 3 1 4 thermal treatment thermal treatment is a physical process based on the volatility of contaminants while the process is more suitable for volatile organic compounds it has been used for removal of volatile metals such as hg it is performed by heating contaminated soil via steam microwave or infrared radiation without combustion or melting of the media or contaminants the volatilized metals are then collected under negative pressure or with a carrier gas compared to vitrification or incineration thermal treatment is much less energy intensive and has the advantage that it can simultaneously remove volatile compounds that are often co present with metals metalloids inorganic mercury is usually present in soil in the elemental state or as mercurial compounds such as hgs hgo and hgco3 thermal treatment can covert the mercurial compounds into the gaseous elemental mercury the main components of a thermal desorption system include a pre treatment and material handling unit a desorption unit and a post treatment unit for treatment of off gas and processed soil the pre treatment involves physical screening to remove extraneous matter such as plastic or rubber and dewatering to achieve suitable moisture content a thermal desorption unit was employed to remove hg from the pre treated media which was operated at temperatures from 320 to 700 c usepa 2007 the high temperature converts mercury into its gaseous form which is then collected and further treated it is one of the few methods that have been applied to the field for removing very high concentrations of hg 260 mg kg in soil temperature and treatment time are the main factors determining the decontamination levels as well as the process cost wang et al 2012a 2012b greater efficiency is achieved at relatively higher temperatures e g from 460 to 700 c busto et al 2011 richter and flachberger 2010 hseu et al 2014 reported that heating soil to 550 c for 1 h was able to remove 99 of hg moreover thermal treatment at high temperatures may alter the soil properties and cause the coexisting contaminants especially trace metals to transform and repartition huang et al 2011 found that thermal treatment at 550 c reduced the mercury content from 1320 to 6 mg kg and altered the binding forms of cr cu and ni from those associated with fe mn oxides into acid extractable organic matter bound and residual forms which are less mobile high energy consumption has been a major concern of this technology to reduce energy consumption thermal treatment may be operated at a lower temperature for a longer time kucharski et al 2005 operated thermal treatment at 100 c for 10 days for remediation of a mercury contaminated soil and was able to achieve 32 mercury removal without negative effects on the growth properties of the soil the advantages of this method include easy and safe implementation mobility of treatment devices effective extraction and recovery of mercury and in particular simultaneous removal or immobilization of co contaminants the major shortcoming is the high energy consumption and capital costs due to the high temperature requirement and the specialized facilities required consequently this technology has been solely used for soil containing very high mercury as far as heavy metals are concerned thermal treatment alters soil properties which can affect certain functions of soil it can cause degradation of som and changes of soil texture and mineralogy combustion of som leads to the loss of c and n altering the available nutrients and elements for plants moreover soil heating is detrimental to microorganisms such as pathogens bacteria and fungi o brien et al 2018 3 2 chemical remediation 3 2 1 chemical stabilization chemical stabilization is a remediation process in which immobilizing agents are added to contaminated soil to decrease the mobility bioavailability and bioaccessibility of heavy metals in soil heavy metals can be immobilized by surface complexation chemical precipitation ion exchange and adsorption thus limiting the transport and bioavailability of heavy metals in soil porter et al 2004 the most commonly applied amending agents in the field include clay minerals phosphate compounds liming materials organic composts metal oxides and biochar table 2 chemical stabilization is a relatively cost effective simple and rapid remediation approach however it does not remove the heavy metals from soil consequently the long term stability should be monitored 3 2 1 1 clay minerals clay minerals are generally regarded as the fine particles contained in the colloidal fraction of soil and sediment they can act as a natural scavenger of heavy metals through ion exchange adsorption and surface processes such as precipitation nucleation and crystallization yuan et al 2013 clay minerals such as aluminosilicates sepiolite palygorskite and bentonite have been widely used for immobilization of heavy metals at the field scale liang et al 2014 sun et al 2015 2016 these naturally abundant materials have the advantages of being green low cost and effective for performance host of heavy metals or metalloids sepiolite mg4si6o15 oh 2 6h2o is a porous fibrous hydrated magnesium silicate it is composed of blocks of two tetrahedral silica sheets which sandwich an octahedral sheet of magnesium oxide hydroxide there are discontinuities and inversions in the silica sheet in sepiolite which give rise to its structural tunnels and blocks akÃ§ay 2004 these tunnels contain h2o molecules and exchangeable cations k and ca2 in the inner blocks all corners of the silica tetrahedral are connected to adjacent blocks whereas in the outer blocks some of the corners are si atoms bound to hydroxyls sioh these sioh groups are the main active centers for metal polycations tekin et al 2006 palygorskite mg al 2si4o10 oh 4h2o is a magnesium aluminum phyllosilicate with a fibrous morphology large specific surface area moderate cation exchange capacity cec and good adsorptive properties the remediation effectiveness of sepiolite and palygorskite has been confirmed in many field demonstrations as shown in table 2 for instance liang et al 2014 conducted a field demonstration experiment in chenzhou hunan province china utilizing sepiolite and palygorskite as amendments to in situ immobilize cd in soil and thereby reducing accumulation of cd in brown grains of rice after 30 days of the amendments the paddy soil ph was increased whereas the hcl tclp cacl2 and nh4oac extractable cd concentrations were significantly reduced resulting in a notable decrease in the cd content in the brown rice chemical precipitation and surface complexation were the main immobilization mechanisms sun et al 2016 investigated the effectiveness and stability of sepiolite for immobilization of cd polluted soil through a three year field experiment the addition of sepiolite resulted in a 4 0 32 5 reduction in tclp extractable cd and a 22 8 61 4 reduction in plant uptake and improved the soil microbial population and enzymatic activities bentonite a 2 1 type of aluminosilicate is a kind of expandable clay composed primarily of montmorillonite due to the isomorphic substitution within the aluminosilicate sheets bentonite is characterized by high permanent negative charges and large specific surface area the negative net charge is balanced by exchangeable cations adsorbed between the unit layers and around their edges narayanan and deshpande 1998 bentonite has been applied effectively for remediation of paddy soil polluted with cd and pb in pot trials sun et al 2015 after 5 weeks of bentonite application at dosages of 0 5 5 the exchangeable fractions of cd and pb were reduced by 11 1 42 5 and 20 3 49 3 respectively whereas the residual portions increased by 3 0 54 3 and 6 7 10 0 the treatments inhibited cd and pb translocation from soil to the aerial parts of oryza sativa l the concentrations of cd and pb in the roots were reduced by 9 4 31 3 and 5 1 26 7 and by 17 4 44 3 and 3 7 7 8 in the shoots respectively there are several limitations associated with the use of clay minerals first it is difficult to deliver the minerals into the deep contaminated zones and thus limiting their uses for in situ soil remediation second the reaction rate is limited by the desorption rate of heavy metals or metalloids from soil third mechanical mixing is usually needed for field soil treatment fourth clay minerals have limited sorption capacity and selectivity for metals as such large dosages are usually required and the immobilized metals metalloids are likely to be remobilized there is a need to enhance the remediation effect and reduce the dosage to lower costs in addition long term monitoring is needed to evaluate the long term stability 3 2 1 2 phosphate compounds soluble phosphate compounds and particulate phosphate minerals have been widely studied for immobilization of heavy metals commonly used phosphate minerals include both natural and synthetic apatite and hydroxyapatite whereas soluble phosphate compounds include phosphate salts and phosphoric acid in principle phosphate containing minerals immobilize heavy metals through direct metal adsorption substitution phosphate induced metal adsorption or surface complexation and chemical precipitation of metals bolan et al 2003a 2003b soluble phosphates can react with multivalent metal cations to form insoluble metal orthophosphates akin to naturally occurring minerals which are usually sparingly soluble with a low solubility product k sp and are stable in the natural biogeochemical environment phosphate can form strong complexes or precipitates with many common heavy metals such as pb k sp of pb5 po4 3cl 10 84 4 ruby et al 1994 cd e g cd3 po4 2oh k sp 10 42 5 and cu k sp of cu5 po4 3cl 10 54 0 cu5 po4 3oh k sp 10 51 6 eighmy et al 1997 eighmy and dykstra eusden 2004 field scale applications of phosphate compounds to immobilize heavy metals have gained growing momentum over the last decade wang et al 2008b undertook a field demonstration using commercial phosphate fertilizers including phosphate rock pr and calcium magnesium phosphate cmp at a site heavily contaminated by pb zn and cd from lead and zinc mining tailings in shaoxing zhejiang china they found that the addition of the pr and cmp fertilizers at different dosages 50 300 and 500 g m2 effectively decreased water soluble and exchangeable fractions by 22 0 81 4 for pb 1 5 30 7 for cd and 11 7 75 3 for zn and tclp extractable pb by 27 71 resulting in reduced uptakes of pb 16 0 58 0 cd 16 5 66 9 and zn 1 2 73 2 by a chinese green vegetable brassica chinensis l campestris qayyum et al 2017 reported that the application of mono ammonium phosphate map in a cd contaminated field significantly enhanced cd immobilization and decreased bioavailable cd in soil resulting in an increase in wheat growth and yield and an decrease in cd accumulation in the straw and grains nanoscale materials have shown great potential for soil remediation due to their small particle size large specific surface area high reactivity and improved soil deliverability sun et al 2018 found that nanoscale calcium hydroxyapatite nano hap was effective for immobilizing cu and zn in a heavy metal polluted soil near a smelting factory the addition of nano hap at 1 3 and 5 reduced the acid soluble fraction of cu by 9 3 24 4 and 35 7 respectively while the reducible and oxidizable fractions of cu were increased by 5 5 and 83 5 respectively at 5 of the nanoparticles as a result the cacl2 extractable concentrations of cu and zn were reduced by 67 8 93 0 and 97 3 and by 63 1 91 5 and 98 5 at a nanoparticle dosage of 1 3 and 5 respectively fig 4 a similarly the tclp leachable cu and zn concentrations were decreased by 27 9 48 8 and 62 8 and by 1 8 22 9 and 27 0 respectively fig 4b the key technical obstacles with this technology are the deliverability of the particles reaction rate and the long term effectiveness typically powder or particulate phosphate minerals or aggregated nanoparticles are added to soil through off situ mixing and thus are suitable for shallow soil that is polluted with high concentrations of heavy metals while the reaction rate is often slow and is limited by the desorption rate of the target metals from the soil the phosphate minerals may offer prolonged effectiveness and may provide a permanent sink for the metals in contrast soluble phosphate may be easily injected into the target soil and provide faster reaction with the target metals and reach the metals in deeper soil however soluble phosphate may only offer shorter reaction lifetime and most phosphate may be unused and washed into the downstream which may cause secondary contamination issues liu and zhao 2007 liu and zhao 2007 2013 developed a new class of stabilized phosphate nanoparticles carboxymethyl cellulose cmc stabilized iron phosphate and cmc stabilized ca phosphate the stabilized nanoparticles can be delivered into moderately permeable soil and facilitate in situ remediation the nanoparticles not only offer much improved binding rate and capacity but also well controlled transport in the subsurface i e their mobility can be controlled by manipulating external injection pressure he et al 2009 once delivered the nanoparticles will remain in the confined domain without spreading as soluble phosphates do phosphate based amending agents are of particular interest to remediation of agricultural soil not only are these materials innocuous to the crops they may also serve as slow releasing fertilizers while binding with the target heavy metals yet more field data are needed to gauge the long term effectiveness and assess the associated impacts on the crops and the local environment 3 2 1 3 liming materials common liming materials include oyster shells and eggshells lim et al 2013 lime and limestone he et al 2016 for their affordable price and ready availability liming materials have been widely accepted as a low cost and effective amendment in reducing the toxicity of heavy metals in field applications soil liming enhances sorption and or precipitation of heavy metals by increasing soluble ph and increasing the negative surface potential of soil matrices cui et al 2016a reported that lime amendment effectively decreased the leachability tclp and synthetic precipitation leaching procedure splp availability cacl2 and macl2 and bioaccessibility simplified bioaccessibility extraction test sbet of cu and cd in a contaminated soil in guixi city jiangxi province china for instance the tclp extractable cu concentration was decreased by 7 90 mg l compared with control and the sbet extractable cu was reduced from 6 09 mg l control to 4 65 mg l hong et al 2009 evaluated the uptake of cd and zn by radish raphanus sativa l after the application of ca oh 2 at 0 2 4 and 8 mg ha and found that both plant sorbed and nh4oac extractable cd and zn concentrations were progressively decreased with increasing ca oh 2 dosage due to the increase in cec and ph of soil lim et al 2013 investigated immobilization of cd and pb in soil using oyster shells and eggshells after 420 d of incubation the exchangeable fraction of cd evolved from 23 64 to 1 90 3 81 while the carbonate fraction increased from 19 59 to 36 66 46 36 similar trend was also observed for pb in addition the treatment also effectively reduced the tclp leachable cd and pb liming materials are often used as co amendments to enhance the sequestration of heavy metals in soil remediation wu et al 2016 combined limestone and sepiolite to remediate a pb and cd contaminated paddy soil near a mining area in southern hunan china they found that the amendment increased the soil ph by up to 1 95 units and decreased the exchangeable concentrations of pb and cd by up to 99 8 like the case of soluble phosphates the use of soluble lime has the advantage of rapid reaction rate but only limited reactive lifetime as the solution may be washed away rapidly by rainwater or along with flowing groundwater in addition immobilization through merely formation of metal oxides or hydroxides may be less durable and may subject to re dissolution when the ambient ph is re established 3 2 1 4 organic composts organic composts include biosolids and animal manure biosolids are solid residues generated during primary secondary or advanced treatments of domestic sanitary sewage conventionally biosolids applied to land are viewed as one of the major components for metal accumulation in soil advances in the treatment of sewage wastewater and separation of industrial wastewater in the sewage treatment plants have resulted in a steady decline in the metal contents of biosolids alkaline stabilized biosolid composts have been used as an effective sink for reducing the bioavailability of metals in contaminated soil and sediment basta et al 2001 demonstrated that lime stabilized biosolid greatly reduced the phytoavailability of cd and zn at smelter sites in oklahoma placek et al 2016 applied sewage sludge as an additive to soil contaminated with cd zn and pb in a field study the application of sewage sludge increased the soil ph cec and content of humic acids leading to an improved metal sorption capacity as a result the readily soluble forms of the metals and the leaching of biogenic components were reduced animal manure is another major source of valuable organic amendments the principal sources of manure are from chicken swine beef cattle dairy and poultry wastes most manure products contain low levels of heavy metals though high concentrations of cu and zn have been found in swine manure and as in poultry litter recent advances in the treatment of manure byproducts have resulted in reduced bioavailability of metals in animal manure for example 87 reduction in cu and zn in wastewater from swine houses was obtained after treatment with lime slurry ferric chloride or polymer westerman and bicudo 2000 similarly treatment of poultry manure with alum al2 so4 3 decreased the concentration of water soluble as zn cu and cd moore et al 1998 hence land applications of livestock and poultry manure byproducts are generally based on total n and p loadings while allowable trace element loadings are often the limiting factors for other biosolids manure byproducts with low contents of metals can be used as a sink for immobilizing heavy metals in soil especially for agricultural soil because of the rich nutrients li et al 2016 investigated the fractionation of cd soil biological properties and cd uptake by wheat following a chicken manure compost amendment in a cd contaminated field soil they found that the compost increased soil ph total p content and som content and enhanced soil biological properties such as microbial biomass invertase protease urease and catalase activities by up to 3 5 times moreover the treatment decreased the acid extractable cd by 8 2 37 6 and increased the reducible and oxidizable cd by 9 2 39 5 and 8 2 60 4 respectively organic amendments usually contain cellulose and lignin as the main constituents other components are extractives hemicellulose proteins lipids starches simple sugars hydrocarbons and many other compounds that contain a number of functional groups such as carbonyl phenolic acetamido groups amido amino structural polysaccharides and esters which can bind with various transition metals niazi et al 2016 in addition application of organic amendments also leads to elevated soil ph which is conducive to metal immobilization due to formation of metal hydroxides and or by preventing sulfide oxidation hydrolysis walker et al 2004 as well as increased negative surface potential gadd 2000 organic amendments are particularly attractive to remediating agricultural soil for their greenness and multitude of beneficial side effects on soil fertility moreover the increase of organic matter by organic amendments can lead to decrease of soil bulk density and increase of soil aeration due to the redistribution of soil pore space tejada et al 2006 3 2 1 5 metal oxides metal oxides such as oxides of fe mn and al with large active surface areas and the amphoteric nature have been extensively studied as metal stabilizing amendments in contaminated soil these mineral components can strongly bind metals via specific sorption co precipitation and inner sphere complexation their application is aimed to decrease the mobile bioavailable and bioaccessible fractions of metals in soil and thus minimizing leaching from soil and uptake by soil organisms plants crops and humans field tests have demonstrated the effectiveness of iron oxides e g hematite maghemite and magnetite and oxyhydroxides e g ferrihydrite goethite akaganeite lepidocrocite and feroxyhite for immobilization of various heavy metals and metalloids e g sb pb and as iron oxides were applied to immobilize as in a paddy field soil near an abandoned auag mine in korea and the amendment effectively prevented as transfer from soil to pore water and crops ko et al 2015 okkenhaug et al 2016 investigated the mobility distribution and speciation of sb and pb in a shooting range soil in south noway when treated with ferric oxyhydroxide powder cfh 12 2 coupled with limestone 1 the treatment resulted in an average decrease of sb and pb in pore water by 66 and 97 respectively which remained stable over four years leachable sb and pb were transformed to amorphous iron oxides bound or even more crystalline and residual mineral phases increasing iron oxides contents in soil can be practically achieved through the application of their precursors e g iron sulfates and elemental iron hartley and lepp 2008 warren and alloway 2003 reported that application of 1 89 w w of commercial grade feso4 resulted in 0 54 of iron oxides in treated soil however soil acidification has been cited as one of the side effects associated with this practice 3 4 f e s o 4 o 2 6 h 2 o 4 f e o o h 4 s o 4 2 8 h as the acidification could cause remobilization of metallic cations lime is often co applied to control the soil ph however addition of bicarbonate alkalinity which is commonly practiced in water coagulation should be avoided as bicarbonate is a fairly strong ligand and may complex and mobilize transition metals lewis acids the use of waste elemental iron as a precursor of iron oxides in soil has been shown to be a potentially effective and cheap amendment for decreasing the mobility and potential bioavailability of various metals in contaminated soil under field conditions elemental iron is oxidized to feooh via liu et al 2014 4 4 f e 3 o 2 2 h 2 o 4 f e o o h the surface oxide layer provides active sites for complexation of heavy metals huang et al 2016 xie et al 2016 injected dissolved fe ii and naclo into the as contaminated aquifer in the field to promote the formation of fe oxides hydroxides which can effectively oxidize as iii into as v and thus removed aqueous both as iii and as v via adsorption co precipitation and or incorporation of as v oxyanions into goethite of the various forms of manganese oxides birnessite todorokite cryptomelane and hausmannite birnessite na ca k xmn2o4 1 5h2o also known as Î´ mno2 is the most common mn oxide due to the large specific surface area and low ph of point of zero charge phpzc 1 8 4 5 dong et al 2000 feng et al 2007 it is much more efficient in adsorbing some metals especially pb compared to fe oxides equations 5 and 6 depict the adsorption of divalent metals me2 onto the amphoteric surface groups of mn oxides zaman et al 2009 5 m n o h m e 2 m n o m e h 6 2 m n o h m e 2 m n o 2 m e 2 h mccann et al 2015 applied a natural mn oxide at a dosage of 10 to immobilize pb in a historically pb contaminated soil the material demonstrated a maximum pb adsorption capacity of 346 mg g and had no adverse effect on soil microbial functioning in addition to adsorption Î´ mno2 offers remarkable oxidizing potential which can effectively convert as iii to as v an and zhao 2012 and degrade organic contaminants such as steroids and antibiotics han et al 2015 as of soil delivery most metal oxides can only be added into soil in the form of powder or granular particles through mechanical mixing which largely impedes their application to deeper soil or in situ remediation uses when soluble precursors are added the effectiveness is then limited by the shorter retention time and the lack of mixing in the subsurface to overcome these practical issues stabilized metal oxide nanoparticles such as magnetite and femn binary oxide are promising for metal immobilization due to their large specific surface area high reactivity and controllable transport in soil an and zhao 2012 liang and zhao 2014 xie et al 2015 for instance an and zhao 2012 investigated the immobilization of as iii in soil using femn binary oxide nanoparticles with cmc as a stabilizer the water leachable arsenic and the tclp leachability were reduced by 91 96 and 94 98 respectively at an fe to as molar ratio of 6 5 39 the nanoparticles demonstrated good soil deliverability and column elution tests of the contaminated soil showed that the nanoparticles transferred nearly all water soluble as iii to the nanoparticle phase the nanoparticle amendment reduced the tclp leachability of as iii remaining in the soil bed by 78 3 2 1 6 biochar biochar is a carbon rich and porous charcoal manufactured during the pyrolysis of organic residues such as municipal waste animal wastes wood crop residues and biosolids recent studies have demonstrated that biochar is able to immobilize soil heavy metals and metalloids and reduce their accumulation in plants which is often attributed to biochar s highly porous structure active functional groups elevated ph and decent cec beesley et al 2011 vithanage et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 in addition land application of biochar has been cited to improve chemical physical and biological properties of soil a number of field tests have been reported in investigating the effectiveness of biochar for soil remediation and table 2 summarizes these latest technologies bian et al 2014 conducted a three year field remediation study 2010 2012 in a cd and pb contaminated rice paddy in southern china where bioavailable cd and pb in the soil were monitored after a single soil amendment of wheat straw biochar at a dosage of 40 t ha the amendment consistently and significantly increased soil ph and total organic carbon and decreased cacl2 extractable cd by up to 70 9 and pb by up to 79 6 over the three year period as a result the total cd uptake by rice o sativa l was reduced by up to 67 3 and the total pb uptake was decreased by up to 69 0 meanwhile the rice yield was increased by 18 3 in the third year biochar amendment was found to alter the binding or speciation of cd and pb in soil cui et al 2016b reported that biochar transformed the exchangeable fractions of cd and pb into relatively more stable fractions residual and organic for instance the exchangeable fractions of cd and pb were decreased by 8 0 44 6 and 14 2 50 3 and the residual fractions were increased by 4 0 32 4 cd and 14 9 39 6 pb during five years the added affinity of heavy metals was attributed to the abundant functional groups and complex structures of biochar the contamination of cd and as in paddy soils is a serious concern in southern china however simultaneous immobilization of these co contaminants is hindered by the different geochemical behaviors of cd and as in paddy fields while application of biochar effectively immobilized cd it also facilitated as v reduction into as iii resulting in increased as toxicity and leachability in the contaminated fields chen et al 2016b vithanage et al 2017 yu et al 2018 developed a zero valent iron zvi biochar composite for simultaneous immobilization of cd and as in two paddy fields in guangdong province china from 2013 to 2015 the corrosion products of zvi demonstrated high sorption capacity for as and biochar showed high capacity for cd when applied at 2250 kg acre on a rice field the treatment reduced the accumulation of cd and as in rice by 48 and 24 respectively increasing the biochar dosage enhances the immobilization effectiveness houben et al 2013 investigated the effect of different application rates of biochar 1 5 and 10 on the fate of cd zn and pb in a contaminated soil in belgium and reported that the cacl2 exchangeable fraction of metals in soil was decreased with increasing rates of biochar after 56 days of incubation long term effectiveness and performance are important criteria to evaluate heavy metals remediation technologies shen et al 2016 conducted a field remediation treatment to examine the long term effect of biochar on the immobilization of heavy metals at a contaminated site soil ph 8 in castleford uk following the application of biochar at 0 5 2 the ni and zn concentrations in the carbonic acid leaching tests were reduced by 83 98 over three years the biochar amendment enhanced the residual fraction of ni and zn in the soil from 51 to 61 66 and from 7 to 27 35 respectively however the field trials conducted by cui et al 2016a showed that the effectiveness of the biochar decreased over time and repeated application was required for full effectiveness they observed a decrease in soil ph and an increase in bioavailability of cu and cd due to leaching of alkalinity biochar has the advantage over organic composts of having a stable fixed carbon structure and a typically high alkalinity biochar amendment makes for a multiple win scenario including carbon sequestration soil improvement i e enhanced soil capacity for retaining nutrients and water and improved soil mechanical strength agronomic benefits metal immobilization and reuse of solid waste however like the case of clay minerals the application of biochar are restricted by the limited adsorption capacity and affinity soil deliverability and reaction rate and are only suitable for shallow soil contaminated with heavy metals there is also limited information available on the long term stability of metals immobilized at the field scale in addition the biochar s effectiveness depends on various factors including metal type immobilization time site specific factors e g climate biochar dosage and mixing depth biochar feedstock type and biochar properties 3 2 2 solidification stabilization solidification stabilization s s also referred to as waste fixation has been widely adopted to amend heavy metals contaminated soil due to its relatively low cost and easy implementation soil solidification is a process that encapsulates the waste materials in a monolithic solid of high structural integrity khan et al 2004 in contrast soil stabilization refers to a process of amending contaminated soil with chemical reagents to convert leachable chemicals to physically and chemically more stable forms it often involves chemical interactions between the target heavy metals and the binding agents chen et al 2009 the objectives of s s are to achieve and maintain the desired physical properties and to chemically stabilize or permanently sequestrate contaminants in the solid phase thereby preventing the chemicals from harming the environment or biota a good binder plays a decisive role in the remediation effectiveness of s s processes cement based binders are commonly used for implementation of s s technologies in the field a field study conducted by wang et al 2014a demonstrated excellent efficacy of cement based binders in remediating metals contaminated soil at a site in west drayton after 17 years of the remediation the tclp leachable concentrations of cu ni zn pb and cd remained below the private water supplies regulations england 2009 antemir et al 2010 evaluated the field performance of cement based s s techniques at a former fireworks and low explosives manufacturing site in england after four years of operation the results indicated that the treated soil was progressively carbonated over time and that pb zn and cu were adequately immobilized calcium aluminate cement cac has received increasing attention as an alternative binder navarro blasco et al 2013 studied the adsorption capacities of cac for pb zn and cu and found that the total uptake could reach up to 3 wt voglar and lestan 2013 used cac and sulfate resistant portland cement src as binders for immobilizing zn pb cu as cd and ni in soil at a brownfield site in slovenia they reported that the cac treatment produced s s soil monoliths of higher mechanical strength up to 7 65 n mm2 and reduced the leachability of zn pb cu as cd and ni more effectively than src blending novel binders and additives e g magnesia and zeolites with the conventional binders is expected to provide added benefits due to their individual credentials in improving the overall s s effectiveness wang et al 2015 evaluated the performance of various binders including portland cement pc ground granulated blast furnace slag ggbs pulverized fuel ash pfa mgo and zeolite for in situ s s field trials at a site contaminated with complex heavy metals e g pb zn cr cu and ni and organic chemicals in the uk s s was implemented using a triple auger system where soil was mixed to a depth of 4 m at various contaminant and binder levels unconfined compressive strength ucs values were 22 3476 kpa and the leachability of the heavy metals in contaminated soil was in the range of 0 002 0 225 mg l based on the batch leaching procedures of bs en 12457 2 the combination of ggbs and mgo at a ratio of 9 1 demonstrated a higher material strength and better immobilization efficiency for heavy metals wang et al 2016 further evaluated the physical and chemical performance of mgo bearing binders for immobilizing heavy metals in contaminated soil over three years after the treatment the results showed that mgo ggbs blends provided higher strength and less leachability of heavy metals compared to pc or mgo alone s s has been considered as one of the most efficient and low risk remediation methods it has several main advantages including relatively low cost easy to implement enhanced soil comprehensive strength high resistance to biodegradation and broad engineering applicability however the metals are not removed from soil and further long term monitoring of heavy metals on site are required the longevity of the s s materials is also questionable moreover this technology usually results in a volume increase in treated media 3 2 3 soil washing soil washing refers to leaching of heavy metals from soil matrix with various reagents or extractants such as water inorganic acids organic acids chelating agents and surfactants typically contaminated soil is dug out and mixed with a suitable extractant solution for a specified time depending on the type of metals and soil the extractant can transfer heavy metals from soil to the liquid phase via chemical dissolution ion exchange chelation or desorption ferraro et al 2015 the treated soil upon regulatory permission is then backfilled to the original sites barring the cost soil washing permanently removes metal contaminants from soil and is a rapid method that can fulfill the remediation goals without any long term liability park and son 2017 a variety of chelators have been tested for soil washing at the field scale edta is the most frequently reported chelating agent due to its strong chelating ability for various heavy metals hu et al 2014 assessed the metal removal efficiency of edta from soil contaminated with cd cu pb and zn the on site metal removal efficiencies were determined to be 80 69 73 and 62 for cd cu pb and zn respectively however there is a growing environmental concern about edta washing because of its poor biodegradability and high persistence in the soil environment which might result in deterioration of soil functions wang et al 2018 employed four biodegradable chelators namely iminodisuccinic acid isa glutamate n n diacetic acid glda glucomonocarbonic acid gca and polyaspartic acid pasp for extracting heavy metals from field contaminated soils collected at a lead zinc contaminated mining wasteland and from a farmland near a non ferrous metal smelter in china the removal of cd pb and zn reached 45 53 and 32 respectively for the mining soil and 85 55 and 64 for the farmland soil moreover the leachability mobility and bioaccessibility of the residual metals after the washing processes were decreased notably compared to the original soil other washing chemicals include salt and high concentrations of chloride solution such as calcium chloride and iron iii chloride guo et al 2016 nagai et al 2012 showed that on site soil washing with fecl3 was able to effectively remove cd in paddy soil the acid soluble cd concentrations in the washed soil extracted with 0 1 m hcl decreased by 47 compared to the untreated soil phosphate solutions can be applied to specifically extract arsenate from soils due to their structural similarity i e tetrahedral oxyanions of phosphate ions po4 3 and arsenate ions aso4 3 jho et al 2015 reported that soil washing with a 0 5 m phosphate solution for 2 h removed 24 5 of as from an as contaminated soil at a former smelter site soil washing is one of the few permanent treatment alternatives to remove heavy metals or metalloids from soil it is rapid highly effective and may allow recovery of the metals in certain cases it markedly reduces the volume of treated soil and the processed soil may be returned to the site however for field scale applications this technology bears with several disadvantages 1 the treated soil may be inappropriate for revegetation due to the deterioration of soil properties and the loss of nutrients and som 2 the presence of chemical agents in the treated soil may cause potential adverse effects 3 the wastewater produced must be further handled or treated which can be quite costly and 4 it only removes the extractable fractions of the contaminants and the degree of removal depends on the chemical agents used development of low cost and green flushing extractants will help to address these concerns 3 3 biological remediation biological remediation is one of the most environmentally friendly options to rectify and re establish the natural conditions of contaminated soil it makes use of microorganisms plants non viable or viable natural or genetically engineered to detoxify or remove heavy metals from the soil and to improve soil quality and restore soil function ye et al 2017a 2017b while it may take a long remediation time it is usually rather cost effective and non invasive and may be used to enhance natural attenuation processes 3 3 1 phytoremediation phytoremediation is a technology that utilizes specialty living plants to fix or adsorb contaminants to remove the contaminants from soil or reduce their environmental impacts and thereby remediating and revegetating contaminated soil it is considered to be an environment friendly attractive aesthetically pleasant non invasive energy efficient and cost effective technology to clean up sites with low to moderate levels of heavy metals the modern technologies of phytoremediation are based on different uptake mechanisms which include phytostabilization phytoextraction and phytovolatilization fig 1 phytostabilization or phytoimmobilization is the use of plants with ability to decrease the mobility or and bioavailability of contaminants via certain mechanisms including adsorption by roots chemical precipitation and complexation in the root zone to this end long living plants such as poplar trees are often employed cheng et al 2016 investigated the feasibility of phytoremediation using miscanthus floridulus with high dry matter yields and a strong vitality on a fallow land contaminated with high concentrations of lead up to 6000 mg kg after one year the lead content in the roots reached 806 7 mg kg and the plant immobilized 1 13 kg ha year of lead from the soil it should be noted that phytostabilization is only effective for a limited depth to the extent the roots can reach and the heavy metals remain in the soil or plants which may need to be monitored regularly or further treated phytoextraction also known as phytoaccumulation phytoabsorption or phytosequestration refers to the uptake of contaminants from soil by plant roots and their translocation and accumulation in the aboveground biomass i e shoots metal translocation to shoots is a crucial biochemical process desirable for effective phytoextraction since the harvest of the root biomass is generally not feasible yang et al 2017 conducted a field study to evaluate the heavy metal phytoextraction potential of the as hyperaccumulator pteris vittata l and the castor bean ricinus communis l in a co planting system where soil was contaminated with as cd and pb they showed that the co planting significantly increased the yield of p vittata and the uptake of as and pb by p vittata the addition of water soluble chitosan further enhanced the uptake of cd and pb by p vittata and r communis phytovolatilization is an approach that involves the uptake and transpiration of metals into their volatile forms and their release into the atmosphere through stomata this technique is primarily useful for hg where mercuric ions are transformed into relatively less toxic elemental form because the volatile form of hg released into the atmosphere may be recycled back to the soil by precipitation this technique presents a temporary solution of the problem in practice phytovolatilization of mercury is considered as a natural consequence of the interaction between plant species with mercury in soil leonard et al 1998 studied mercury exchange flux between aerial parts of five plant species lepidium latifolium artemisia douglasiana caulanthus sp fragaria vesca eucalyptus globulus grown on a hg contaminated soil 450 1605 mg kg and air in a glasshouse at 30 5 c in the daytime the plant to atmosphere emission of mercury was in the range of 10 93 ng m2 h and caulanthus sp demonstrated the highest mercury emission rate for all the plant species emissions in the dark were an order of magnitude less than that during the daytime mercury volatilization through the stomata accounted for 90 of the total mercury emission phytoremediation has been considered to be an attractive option for remediation of soil with low to moderate levels of metal pollution however it typically takes a lengthy remediation period the efficiency is generally restricted by the low biomass and slow growth rate of metal hyperaccumulator plants and the metals enriched biomass may need further handling and disposal moreover some hyper accumulating species may be invasive and thus subject to regulatory restrictions lastly sustainable phytoremediation depends on the climatic and weather conditions 3 3 2 microbial remediation microbial remediation refers to the process of using microorganisms i e bacteria fungi and algae to induce the adsorption precipitation oxidation and reduction of heavy metals or metalloids in soil thereby lowering the availabilities of the contaminants the microorganisms may be indigenous to a contaminated area or may be isolated from elsewhere in practice contaminated soil is inoculated with selected microorganisms by spray irrigation or infiltration galleries injection wells may be applied if the contaminants are deep in soil typical microbial remediation techniques include biosorption bioprecipitation bioleaching biotransformation and biovolatilization biosorption is a process that involves trapping of heavy metals via the cellular structure of a microorganism and subsequently sorption onto the binding sites of the cell wall the microbial cell wall consisting of polysaccharides lipids and proteins offers many functional groups including carboxylate hydroxyl amino and phosphate groups that can bind heavy metals extracellular polymeric substances eps or exopolysaccharides secreted by microorganisms have been reported to act as surface active agents for binding with heavy metals wang et al 2014b applied a mutant species b38 from the wild type of bacillus subtilis under uv irradiation together with a bio fertilizer novogro ng for remediation of farmland soil contaminated with cd cr hg and pb in tianjin china they demonstrated that b38 was an effective biosorbent for the heavy metals and the co amendment of b38 and ng reduced the heavy metal contents in the edible part of radish by 30 8 96 0 bioprecipitation describes the transformation of soluble species of heavy metals or metalloids into insoluble hydroxides carbonates phosphates and sulfides through microbial metabolism researchers have reported the role of sulfate reducing bacteria srb in immobilizing heavy metals by generating sulfides vitor et al 2015 zhang and wang 2016 groudev et al 2014 investigated the effect of srb biostimulation on the mobility of cd cu and zn from an acidic leached cinnamonic forest soil under field conditions and found that the metals were precipitated as the insoluble sulfides as a result of the activity of the indigenous srb inhabiting in the soil subhorizon 30 50 cm bioleaching refers to the dissolution of metallic minerals and the release of associated metals via microorganism activity the microorganisms used mainly include chemoautotrophic bacteria and fungi such as leptospirillum ferrooxidans acidithiobacillus thiooxidans acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and aspergillus niger the well known fe s oxidizing bacteria thiobacillus and leptospirillum ferrooxidans can oxidize iron and sulfide producing sulfuric acid and releasing associated heavy metals akcil et al 2015 nguyen and lee 2015 found that as cu fe mn and zn were removed by 42 4 45 0 47 7 92 and 67 2 respectively in mine tailings using a mixed culture of acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans after 500 h at 0 5 elemental sulfur concentration zeng et al 2015 reported that aspergillus niger strain sy1 effectively removed pb cd cu and zn from contaminated sediment by up to 99 5 56 0 71 9 and 76 4 biotransformation e g methylation reduction and dealkylation oxidation can change the chemical form of heavy metals and thus altering their mobility toxicity and bioavailability it is particularly applicable to heavy metals whose toxicity varies with different oxidation states for instance the mercury resistant bacteria organomercurial lyase converts methyl mercury to hg ii which is one hundred fold less toxic than methyl mercury wu et al 2010 direct enzymatic reduction through metal reducing microorganism can reduce soluble and mobile cr vi into insoluble and immobile cr iii jobby et al 2018 tapase and kodam 2018 isolated an arsenic oxidizing Î± proteobacterial strain microvirga indica s mi1b sp nov from a heavy metal contaminated soil and found that the strain possessed arsenite oxidase gene and completely oxidized 15 mm as iii to as v within 39 h this approach may be extended to immobilization of many other redox active contaminants such as se u and tc however cautions should be exercised to avoid converting less mobile or less toxic forms of metals or metalloids into more mobile or more toxic forms biovolatilization involves turning a soluble contaminant into its volatile state for metals or metalloids this technique is only applicable to se and hg wu et al 2010 chen et al 2018 tan et al 2016 for instance mercury resistant bacteria can utilize the mera enzyme to reduce hg ii to the volatile form hg 0 wu et al 2010 chen et al 2018 tested a two stage system chemical extraction followed by microbial reduction for removal of hg from field contaminated soils they found that 77 of hg was extracted from the soils after the first step extraction process with 0 5 m ammonium thiosulfate and up to 81 of hg2 was transformed from the washing solution through the biotransformation of hg reducing bacteria enterobacter cloacae microbial remediation has been considered as a safe easy and effective technology it has the advantages of low energy requirement low operation cost no environmental and health hazards and possibility of recovering heavy metals it is a natural process and is therefore perceived by the public as an acceptable treatment process yet microbial remediation is effective only when environmental conditions permit the desired microbial growth and activity additional nutrients oxygen and other amendments are usually required to stimulate microbial activity and enhance the bioremediation process the process is usually slow and time consuming and it is often needed to combine bioremediation with physical chemical approaches to speed up the remediation process and boost the efficiency 3 3 3 microbial assisted phytoremediation the rhizosphere is an important habitat for microorganisms including bacteria fungi algae and protozoa the efficiency of phytoremediation can be enhanced by assistance of plant growth promoting pgp bacteria including serratia bacillus pseudomonas burkholderia enterobacter erwinia klebsiella beijerinckia flavobacterium and gluconacetobacter babu et al 2013 sheng et al 2008 tak et al 2013 the enhancement can be achieved in several ways first these bacteria have the ability to affect heavy metals mobility and availability to the plant and they can transform heavy metals into bioavailable and soluble forms through the action of siderophores organic acids biosurfactants biomethylation and redox processes facilitating plant uptake of the soil bound metals the bacteria have developed various metal tolerance mechanisms including exclusion biosorption active removal precipitation or bioaccumulation in both external and intracellular spaces rajkumar et al 2009 in addition enzymatic detoxification represents another metal resistance mechanism e g bio reduction of hg ii into hg 0 second pgp bacteria possess several growth promoting capabilities including phosphorus solubilization nitrogen fixation iron sequestration and phytohormone and acc 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylic acid deaminase synthesis li and ramakrishna 2011 which can improve plant growth increase plant biomass and in turn assist phytoremediation for instance jiang et al 2008 isolated a heavy metal resistant bacterial strain identified as burkholderia sp j62 from a heavy metal contaminated soil and applied to a field contaminated soil with pb and cd the isolate increased bacterial solubilization of both metals in both solution culture and in soil with production of indole acetic acid siderophore and 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylate deaminase and also dissolution of inorganic phosphate moreover the treatment significantly improved the biomass of maize and tomato plants and enhanced the accumulation of pb and cu in the plant tissues babu et al 2013 reported that inoculating soil with the bacterial strain isolated from roots of pinus sylvestris significantly increased biomass chlorophyll content nodule number and accumulation of heavy metals as cu pb ni and zn in the hyperaccumulator alnus firma seedlings 3 4 combined remediation combined remediation involves applications of two or more physical chemical and or biological remediation technologies it supplements the limitations with individual technology alone and takes advantage of different techniques to enhance the remediation efficiency combined remediation methods such as chemically assisted phytoextraction wang et al 2011 electrokinetic remediation coupled with complexing agents robles et al 2012 electrokinetic remediation combined with phytoextraction mao et al 2016 citric acid facilitated thermal treatment ma et al 2015 soil washing coupled with chemical stabilization zhai et al 2018 chemical stabilization and phytoremediation fellet et al 2014 have attracted a lot of attention for instance wang et al 2011 investigated mercury uptake by plant chenopodium glaucum l growing on a mercury contaminated soil and observed that addition of ammonium thiosulphate a sulfur containing ligand significantly increased the solubility of mercury and thereby enhanced the mercury uptake robles et al 2012 demonstrated that complexing agents such as edta can facilitate mercury removal from mining soils in querÃ©taro mexico in an electrokinetic remediation process up to 75 of hg was removed by wetting the soil with 0 1 m edta and after 6 h of electrokinetic treatment the enhanced efficacy was attributed to increased electromigration of the edta hg complexes ma et al 2015 combined citric acid and thermal treatment to enhance hg removal from a farmland soil in guizhou province china at a citric acid hg molar ratio of 15 the mercury level in soil was reduced from 134 to 1 1 mg kg upon treatment at 400 c for 1 h with an estimated reduction of energy input by 35 the addition of citric acid enhanced the volatilization of mercury by providing an acidic environmental condition wu et al 2017 reported that combining biochar amendment and composting is an attractive remediation technology the interaction of biochar and composts boosted the nutrients cec functional groups and organic matter on the biochar and increased the nutrients cec organic matter and microbial activities of the composts these favorable modifications are expected to improve the efficiencies for soil amendment and remediation 4 economic considerations physical remediation methods generally require large amounts of manpower and material resources whereas chemical approaches require a larger cost share for chemicals or reagents in general chemical approaches are more cost effective than physical remediation under similar remediation goals especially for deeper soil and where only low dosages of immobilizing agents or chemical extractants are needed bioremediation is more economical and greener than physical chemical approaches but its uses are confined by the reachability of biota and technical effectiveness us epa 2004 reported that the total for phytoremediation ranged from us 25 to 100 per ton of soil compared to 300 500 ton for vitrification and 75 210 ton for soil washing frtr 2007 reported a cost range of 50 117 m3 for electrokinetic remediation and 33 32 m3 for soil washing martin and ruby 2004 estimated a cost of 40 65 m3 for in situ chemical stabilization chang and yen 2006 estimated a cost of us 834 m3 for a full scale thermal desorption process 750 c for 3 h to treat mercury contaminated soil 5 concluding remarks and future research needs soil contamination by heavy metals has been a worldwide challenge and remediation technologies have come a long way over the past decade or so this review presents the latest development and knowledge on the general principles and effectiveness of key remediation techniques that have been studied or demonstrated at the field scale in general physical remediation methods can remove heavy metals metalloids from contaminated soil groundwater eliminating long term effects and are effective for highly contaminated sites with multiple heavy metals metalloids however these methods are highly costly environmentally destructive and only applicable to small contaminated volume where the contaminants are readily accessible chemical methods are rapid simple easy to apply relatively economical and may be used for in situ remediation however chemical stabilization techniques do not remove the contaminants from the media and long term monitoring is needed biological methods are environmentally friendly safe least destructive and cost efficient however biological processes are often time consuming and only effective for low to moderate levels of heavy metals metalloids combined remediation methods may overcome the limitations of single technology alone but require complex operating conditions as technology continues to evolve it is generally agreed that the adopted method should not only have a remarkable effect on reducing the amount bioavailability and toxicity of the contaminants but also cause minimal disturbance to the natural environment or local ecological systems the ecological impact should be considered in the establishment of remediation goals and environmental criteria in addition this review reveals the following key knowledge gaps and practical challenges which should be addressed to advance the remediation technology 1 the remediation criteria have shown a trend to shift from reducing the total concentration of the contaminants to lowering the fraction that is more leachable or bioavailable given the often inhibitive cost for removing total heavy metals from soil treating the more risky fraction of the contaminants appears more practical however careful monitoring the residual metals in the soil is needed especially at sites that are subject to significant perturbation in biogeochemical conditions 2 while the immobilization or stabilization approaches have been increasingly accepted in soil remediation practices it is important to know whether immobilized metals are reversible and stable under natural and disturbed conditions long term years to decades field experiments are needed to evaluate the stability and remobilization of the immobilized contaminants while remediation companies are often held responsible for long term stability of the immobilized metals a mechanism for long term monitoring and liability for completed sites has been lacking as a result field data have been rare or lacking on the long term effectiveness of the remediation practices 3 it is highly desired to further investigate the molecular level reaction mechanisms that govern the heavy metal metalloid speciation and mobility such information may aid in development of mechanism based models to predict long term stability or mobility of metals under various environmental conditions in addition the information can provide sound scientific basis for improvement of current remediation techniques 4 it has been a rule rather than exception that soil and groundwater are polluted with multiple pollutants including metals metalloids and organic chemicals there is a need to understand the impact of soil amendments on the stability of co contaminants cautions should be exercised in the remediation process to minimize disturbance to the local biogeochemical conditions and to avoid mobilization of other co contaminants for example addition of phosphate compounds to soil may mobilize arsenate 5 the effects of soil amendments on soil properties and soil groundwater biogeochemical conditions should be measured at the field scale field studies should also determine bioavailability phytotoxicity and ecoreceptor endpoints to show reduction of risks conversely the environmental fate of the amending agents in the soil should be followed under field conditions 6 there is an urgent need for technologies suitable for remediating agricultural land contaminated with metals metalloids especially when active farming is practiced as well as sites located in residential areas or soil in deep aquifers 7 further studies are needed to develop and test mechanistically sound models to predict the adsorption reaction rates desorption kinetics and chemical speciation under field biogeochemical conditions such models are useful to gauge the effectiveness of the technology and to assess the long term stability of immobilized heavy metals 8 as remediation practices are increasingly constrained by complex factors that are beyond the conventional cost effectiveness a systematic life cycle analysis method is needed to take into account technical economic and sustainability issues in assessing field
