15495,due to the depositional environment river deltas are said to act as filters and sinks for pollutants however many deltas are also densely populated and rapidly urbanizing creating new and increased sources of pollutants these sources pose the risk of tipping these environments from pollution sinks to sources to the world s oceans we provide detailed seasonal and annual assessments of metal contaminants in riverine suspended particulate matter spm across the densely populated red river delta rrd vietnam the global contributions of elements from the rrd are all 0 2 with many elemental fluxes 0 01 suggesting the rrd is not a major source of elemental pollution to the ocean however hotspots of metal pollution due to human activity and the impacts of tropical storm son tinh july 2018 exceed both national level regulations and international measures of toxicity e g enrichment factors there is widespread extreme pollution of cd enrichment factor 40 and concentrations of as higher than national regulation limits 17 mg kg at all sites other than one upstream agricultural dominated tributary in the dry season these hotspots are characterised by high inputs of organic matter e g manure fertiliser and urban wastewater which influences elemental mobility in the particulate and dissolved phases and are potentially significant sources of pollution downstream in addition in the marine and fresh water mixing zone salinity effects metal complexation with organic matter increasing metals in the particulate phase our calculations indicate that the delta is currently acting as a pollutant sink as determined by high levels of pollutant deposition 50 however increased in washing of pollutants and future projected increases in monsoon intensity saline intrusion and human activity could shift the delta to become a source of toxic metals we show the importance of monitoring environmental parameters primarily dissolved organic matter and salinity in the rrd to assess the risk of transport and accumulation of toxic metals in the delta sediments which can lead to net increases in anthropogenic pollution in the coastal zone and the incorporation of toxic elements in the food chain keywords elemental flux suspended particulate matter anthropogenic pollution sediment transport tropical deltas data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large rivers are the main source of eroded material into the world s oceans with 70 of global suspended particulate matter spm derived from rivers in southern asia the large pacific and the indian ocean islands viers et al 2009 riverine spm comprises inorganic e g clay minerals and iron manganese fe mn oxyhydroxides and organic detritic or living matter and is the primary carrier of heavy metals in fluvial systems large asian rivers are therefore important in global biogeochemical cycles and the transport of pollutants through watersheds on average 90 of riverine spm is deposited in estuaries and deltas martin and whitfield 1983 making south and southeast asian mega deltas a potentially significant sink of pollutants the primary sources of metals in riverine spm are from atmospheric deposition weathering of catchment materials and anthropogenic inputs e g agricultural runoff the textural composition and organic matter of sediments is critical in determining the sorption and complexation of transition metals jenne 1968 warren and zimmerman 1994 with the mineralogy and grain size of silts and clays predominantly carrying metal contamination from upstream e g roy et al 2018 the amount of spm delivered by rivers therefore depends on 1 natural catchment controls including relief surface area geology vegetation type and cover and climate temperature precipitation runoff intensity and number of flood events and 2 anthropogenic activities and catchment modifications including industry agriculture land cover and the diversion of flow furthermore sediments are transported downstream or deposited as bottom sediments but natural e g flooding and anthropogenic e g dredging activities can lead to their resuspension asian mega deltas such as the red river delta rrd in vietnam deliver 30 of global suspended sediment to the oceans samanta and dalai 2018 excess sediment in coastal environments can lead to increased turbidity with negative impacts on endangered benthic marine organisms such as coral reefs and increases in the net contribution of anthropogenic pollutants to the coastal zone asian mega deltas are some of the most densely populated and urbanizing environments in the world ericson et al 2006 woodroffe et al 2006 increasing the input of suspended matter and pollutants to the coast however estimates of annual fluxes of pollutants through such deltas are still limited here we provide the first detailed multi seasonal assessment of river spm elemental composition and contamination for the rrd vietnam 1 1 the red river delta the rrd northern vietnam is the fourth largest delta in southeast asia spanning 14 300 km2 fig 1 the monsoonal climate annual rainfall 700 4800 mm yr 1 has a rainy season from may to october up to 80 of rainfall and a dry season from november to april spm is therefore highly seasonal le et al 2020 the delta is situated 3 m above sea level and throughout the quaternary eustatic sea level changes have shifted the boundary between fluvial and marine dominated environments today tidal effects can be seen in river levels at phu ly located close to d6 fig 1c and during the dry season they can extend up to hanoi h5 fig 1c minh et al 2014 the fluvial network of the delta is dense 2 4 km km2 extending 1126 km from the source in china to the mouth at ba lat estuary tran 2007 on entry to vietnam the river known as the thao river receives water from the da river and the lo river it enters the deltaic area as the red hong river at son tay h4 fig 1 where it then divides to the day river and duong river the duong river flows eastwards and drains out of the delta area fig 1c the main channel continues to flow through hanoi to ba lat fig 1 the day river to the right of the main channel has a length of 240 km and a watershed area of 8500 km2 of river discharge 21 is derived from the upper red river in china with 54 and 25 derived from the da and lo rivers respectively however an estimated 78 of spm is eroded from upstream in china ha and coynel 2016 the dense river network with easy access to water has encouraged settlement with a population of 21 million growing annually by 1 14 general statistic office 2018 2020 and a rapid increase of industry and agriculture in 2017 37 of land was used for agriculture general statistic office 2017 and there were 731 traditional so called craft villages specialising in a variety of industries including textiles food processing ceramic works and recycling plants mahanty et al 2012 waste products from domestic activities agriculture and industry including nutrients and heavy metal pollution enter the river network unregulated and untreated quynh et al 2005 luu et al 2012 mahanty et al 2012 consequently air and water pollution in 90 of craft villages throughout vietnam exceed the limits required under the law on environmental protection monre 2008 the world bank 2008 epa 2009 with a monitoring record covering 21 years since 2000 trinh et al 2009 the rrd is one of the best studied tropical river systems whilst industrial and agricultural pollution of the rrd are well studied and often quantified e g luu et al 2012 mahanty et al 2012 ha and coynel 2016 there is minimal information on seasonal and annual fluxes of suspended elements through the catchment elements in the dissolved phase e g cr from mining and craft villages have been documented mahanty et al 2012 around hanoi and the bioaccumulation of metals zn cu and cd has been quantified for the nhue day river basin ngo et al 2021 however potential widespread pollution due to the transport resuspension and deposition of spm across the delta remains largely unknown previous work has focused on either the red e g le et al 2018 or day nhue catchments e g do and nishida 2014 do et al 2019 luu et al 2020 ngo et al 2021 high suspended sediment fluxes in the red river in combination with numerous pollution sources lead to a high proportion of trace metals in the particulate phase trinh et al 2013 therefore we aimed to provide a more complete overview of sediment and pollutant flux from 18 locations across the rrd over a 18 month period from february 2018 to july 2019 quantifying the annual fluxes of pollutants in the rrd and its contribution to global biogeochemical cycles for the first time 2 methods 2 1 field collections eighteen sampling points were located at key parts of the red 10 stations and day nhue rivers 8 stations covering a range of land uses table 1 to characterise spatial and temporal trends in sediment delivery and metal contamination across the rrd sites are labelled as h and d respectively upstream site h1 is located at the thao river after the river enters vietnam from china the delta starts at son tay h4 and the river flows through the east side of hanoi city at h5 fig 1 the upstream catchment h1 h4 has a low population density 100 inhabitant km2 and high forest cover le et al 2020 the remaining portion of the catchment has a very high population density 1000 inhabitant km2 intensive agriculture and urban pollution le et al 2020 the nhue river receives wastewater from hanoi city h5 and enters the day river upstream of d6 fig 1 introducing further potential contaminants into the day river in addition the expansion of hydropower and associated impoundments in the catchment has reduced sediment delivery le et al 2020 and introduced the potential for downstream storage of contaminants from urban and agricultural wastewater the 18 locations were sampled monthly between february 2018 and july 2019 fig 1 across a range of land uses table 1 at each location water was sampled at 50 cm depth and filtered using gf f 0 7 µm filter papers between 300 1000 ml of water was filtered until adequate suspended sediment was retained on the filter paper table s1 filter papers were pre weighed and ashed at 550 c prior to collection two filter papers were retained for the calculation of total suspended solids tss and heavy trace metal concentration for analysis of major ions to characterise waters of marine composition a 30 ml aliquot of filtered water was retained and stored at 10 c to permit a comparison of upstream contaminant storage in the rrd catchment and examine the effects of impoundment on the transport of elements core top sediments 0 1 cm from a 61 cm sediment core collected from hoa binh reservoir in 2017 were retained for icp ms analysis 2 2 hydrological data to calculate the element fluxes of particulate matter in the rrd daily river discharge m3 s was obtained from nine hydrological stations in the upstream sites h1 h3 and downstream sites h4 h5 h7 h8 h9 h10 reaches of the red river there are no hydrological stations recording river discharge in the right branch of the red river or the day nhue river basin d sites instead four stations record daily water level cm ba tha d3 phu ly d6 gian khau h6 and nhu tan d10 water level data were provided by the centre of hydro meteorology hmd vietnam centre for hydro meteorological data http cmh com vn en to derive discharge for 2018 2019 the water level discharge relationships in luu et al 2010 were used to investigate the seasonal patterns in discharge across the delta z scores were calculated to compare amongst sites a z score calculates the standard deviation relative to the mean to standardize the data and allow seasonal patterns to be highlighted a monthly z score was calculated for each hydrological station and subsequently used to generate a mean z score for the rrd as a whole using the following equation 1 z x μ σ where x is the hydro meteorology station monthly mean discharge μ is the rrd mean annual discharge and σ is the standard deviation of rrd annual discharge 2 3 water ionic composition to delineate the marine influence and therefore the effects of salinity on element partitioning dissolved major ions na mg k ca cl and so4 2 were analysed filtered waters were analysed by ion chromatography according to the methods described in apha 2017 and corrected for cyclic salts total alkalinity was determined by the single point titration method using methyl orange as a colouring indicator according to methods described in clesceri et al 1999 2 4 total suspended sediment tss filter papers were dried at 105 c for 24 hrs and weighed after cooling in a desiccator tss values including organic matter were then calculated as follows 2 tss mg l 1 weigh t 1 mg weigh t 2 mg x 10 3 volume ml where weight1 is the final weight of the filters and weight2 is the initial dry weight of the filter tss is monitored daily at the national hydro meteorology stations yen bai hoa binh vu quang hanoi and ba lat table 1 using the same filtration method and 1 l of water monthly averages and one standard deviation of tss were calculated from these daily measurements and compared with our one off monthly value in most cases our value falls within one standard deviation of their mean monthly tss value suggesting our data are representative of monthly tss since the values are representative the hydro meteorology station tss is not available at all sites and the method is most comparable to the collection of spm for elemental analysis our monthly measurements of tss were used for the calculation of elemental fluxes daily spm elemental fluxes were calculated using daily hydro meteorology station tss data at the appropriate stations to provide an idea of the variability in flux calculations text s1 tss fluxes were not calculated based on our tss data because the 2019 sampling period only covered half of the year until july 2019 and modelling the data for the remainder of the year would introduce uncertainty into the calculation whereas the hydro meteorology station tss provides daily data for the full 12 months providing a more accurate calculation of flux furthermore the use of the hydro meteorology station data allowed comparison with historical trends 2 5 suspended particulate matter spm geochemistry 2 5 1 heavy and trace metal concentrations filter papers were freeze dried and weighed directly into microwave vessels to which 5 ml of concentrated hno3 and 0 1 ml hf was added vessels were left to settle for 30 min before sealing the vessels were heated via a ramping programme to 200 c using a cem mars microwave system cooled before venting to prevent the release of volatiles e g si and 0 5 ml of h2o2 added heating cooling and venting was repeated for a second cycle before solutions were transferred to savellex containers and dried gently at 90 c overnight on a hotplate the residue was reconstituted with 1 ml concentrated hno3 heated for 30 min at 30 c and made up to a total volume of 10 ml with deionised water blank filters were analysed with each microwave batch for subsequent blank correction after analysis two additional blank filters were spiked with a certified reference material nist 2584 within each microwave batch as a measure of reproducibility and accuracy for the dissolution stage analysis of sample solutions was undertaken using an agilent 8900 series icp qqq ms to overcome polyatomic interferences the icp ms collision cell was operated in he mode at a flow rate of 5 5 ml min 1 for all elements except p and as for these elements o2 was introduced into the cell at a flow rate of 30 in conjunction with ms ms determination to measure the oxide product ion e g 75as16o quality control qc standards were analysed at the start and end of each run and after no more than every 20 samples 2 5 2 annual flux estimation january to december is defined here as the annual cycle to allow comparison with previous work in the rrd e g luu et al 2010 le et al 2020 and to give equal weighting to wet and dry seasons of 6 months each annual fluxes of tss were calculated using the daily hydro meteorology station data and the calculation used in le et al 2020 3 flux 10 6 ty r 1 c i q i 24 60 60 10 6 10 000 00 where i is the day of year ci is the discrete instantaneous concentration mg l 1 on a given day qi is the corresponding daily discharge m3 s to establish the degree of anthropogenic influence or geogenic origin of heavy and trace elements enrichment factors ef were calculated for each element 4 ef x x a l sample x a l ucc where ef x is the enrichment factor of the given element x and x al is the concentration of the selected element normalised to the concentration of al in the sample upper continental crust ucc values were taken from taylor and mclennan 1985 mclennan 2001 rudnick and gao 2003 and hu and gao 2008 to determine the degree of anthropogenic enrichment the contamination categories of sutherland 2000 were used text s2 ef values were also calculated for the global average spm and a range of asian rivers text s1 where the average spm ef value across the catchment for the sampling period was below 2 suggesting geogenic origin the element is excluded from further discussion but is presented alongside other flux calculations annual spm metal fluxes were calculated for each sampling location using 5 flux 10 3 tyr 1 c d x tss d x q d x 0 0846 where cd is the concentration mg kg of a given element on the sampling day tssd is the total suspended sediment on the given sampling day mg l 1 q d is the daily discharge m3 s and 0 0846 is the conversion factor to tonnes the measured tss from the field collected filter paper was used in this equation to best reflect the spm concentration collected at the same time this was calculated for each sampling day and regression curves using a power function flux aqb table s3 were developed to estimate fluxes for the remaining days the annual flux was the sum of daily fluxes which could then be compared to other tropical rivers and used to calculate inflow and outflow text s2 3 results 3 1 hydro meteorology station discharge mean monthly rrd discharge varies seasonally with peak discharge during the wet season may to october fig 2 a discharge between 2018 and 2019 was highly variable across the catchment fig 2b which is reflected in the high standard deviations in monthly rrd z score discharge fig 2a over the sampling period the highest and most variable discharges were recorded at son tay fig 2b variability in discharge was lowest at ba tha gian khau and phy ly located on the day river d sites fig 2b discharge was lower in 2019 than 2018 at all hydro meteorology stations other than ba lat located at the mouth of the hong river the seasonality in mean rrd discharge is also displayed in the mean monthly discharge at each hydro meteorology station fig s2 text s3 3 2 marine versus freshwater influence dissolved ionic composition of waters from h10 hong river in the lower part of the delta sit in the hydrochemical space of na k cl dominance typical of marine waters fig 3 in contrast the remaining sites were ca2 dominated and are typical of freshwaters marine or freshwater ionic composition was unaltered during the wet and dry seasons other than in january 2019 dry season at d10 at the mouth of the day river when waters were of marine composition suggesting some saline intrusion with reduced freshwater inflow fig 3 3 3 tss concentrations from our sampling average tss concentrations were highest at the most upstream site h1 an annual average of 152 59 114 81 1σ mg l 1 in 2018 and 114 37 124 87 mg l 1 in 2019 and lowest at h3 annual averages of 9 10 9 20 mg l 1 and 4 81 6 39 mg l 1 located on the da river tributary table 2 tss concentrations were often highest in the wet season table 2 except for in a few sites in the mid delta d7 d8 in 2019 d10 in 2019 and h6 in 2018 it is important to note that our sampling for 2019 only covers january to july and therefore the values are not directly comparable to 2018 which covers february to december for monthly concentrations consult table s4 daily tss concentrations at hydro meteorology stations are not used in the calculation of elemental fluxes but concentrations were compared to see if one off monthly sampling precisely reflected monthly tss in most cases our value falls within one standard deviation of their mean monthly tss value for detailed comparison see text s4 3 4 metal concentration of spm seasonal trends in suspended metal concentrations were spatially variable across the rrd catchment fig s3 text s5 for metal concentrations in riverine sediments the vietnamese national technical regulation on sediment quality sets limits for cr cu as cd and pb table s7 qcvn 43 2017 btnmt concentrations of as were high at all sites across the rrd exceeding the qcvn limits for at least two months of the year in both the wet and dry seasons fig 4 in general concentrations were lowest in h3 the da river flowing from hoa binh reservoir whereas concentrations exceeded limits for sediments in both fresh and brackish waters at numerous sites in the day river d sites for cr cu cd and pb concentrations at most sites were below the limits set by qcvn fig 4 with the exception of the upstream site of h1 during the dry season march and april in 2018 in march 2019 concentrations of cu were close within 10 mg kg to the limit particulate concentrations of cr were more distinctively seasonal with concentrations above qcvn limits in the wet season june to october at all sites other than h1 furthest upstream and h10 at the mouth of the river strong significant positive correlations p 0 001 were observed in both the wet and dry seasons between fe and ti r 0 933 and 0 910 in the wet season between p and mn r 0 943 and cr and cd r 0 939 and in the dry season between cr and cu r 0 998 and cd and pb r 0 961 significant p 0 005 but weak negative correlations r 0 4 were observed between p and ti p and fe ti and cr ti and mn ti and cd cr and fe mn and fe mn and ba fe and cd and cd and ba these negative correlations were observed in wet and dry seasons 3 4 1 enrichment factors average rrd ef values for mg k ca and ti were below 2 suggesting geogenic origin however values for some locations suggest moderate mg k ca ti localised pollution primarily around sites d5 to d7 located around hanoi fig 5 enrichment factors for four elements mn as cd ba were 40 at one location suggesting extreme pollution average rrd ef values were 40 extreme pollution and above the global average value for cd and ba cd values were 40 at all sites in the rrd and were above the global average at h1 h5 h8 and d5 the highest average ef of 933 at d5 hanoi suggests high localised pollution for ba values for all sites in the rrd were higher than the average global and asian values an ef value of 137 for ba at h3 located on the tributary flowing from hoa binh reservoir suggests a pollution hotspot there are several elements where ef values indicate moderate pollution but were lower than the average values for asian rivers including ni average rrd ef of 4 and pb average rrd ef of 7 for all elements the ef values for core top sediments in hoa binh were lower than the average value for the rrd suggesting significant anthropogenic pollution downstream however ef values highlight moderate pollution of cr mn ni and cu significant pollution of as and extreme pollution of cd 3 5 annual fluxes of tss and elements annual fluxes of tss estimated from the hydro meteorological station data for yen bai h1 vu quang h2 hoa binh h3 hanoi h5 and ba lat h10 are presented in table 3 unlike our sampling data the tss data from the hydro meteorology station is available for all months of 2018 and 2019 the highest annual flux was estimated for h1 furthest upstream with 23 5 106 tonnes yr 1 in 2018 and the lowest at hoa binh of 0 3 106 tonnes yr 1 in 2019 the annual tss flux in 2019 was lower at all hydro meteorology stations when compared with previous data from le et al 2020 the tss flux for yen bai in 2018 is anomalously high compared with the 2010 2019 period but 2019 is more similar to fluxes between 2010 and 2015 at 9 2 106 tonnes yr 1 table 3 for vu quang and hoa binh the 2018 and 2019 flux shows a steady decline since 2010 2015 in agreement with previous trends higher fluxes of all elements in particulate form were exported from the hong river than the day river and fluxes were substantially higher in 2018 table 4 higher fluxes of li mg k ca cu and as were associated with the upper delta whereas fluxes of al p ti cr mn fe ni cd pb were higher in the middle delta annual fluxes of cu ba c and n were highest in the lower section of the delta fluxes of li mg p ti cr mn fe ni cu as cd ba and pb decreased between the upstream and middle section of the delta before increasing at d10 and h10 where the delta is influenced by marine waters fig 6 fluxes of all elements were highest in the upstream section of the delta h1 h5 with fluxes at h4 and h5 around hanoi being substantially higher for most elements fig 6 the elemental flux entering the delta at d6 h6 and h4 was lower than that exported from d10 h9 h10 h7 and thuong cat by an average of 48 08 in 2018 and 50 46 in 2019 the greatest increases were exhibited by mg 87 27 in 2018 and 86 85 in 2019 and least by cr 29 48 and ca 20 26 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 5 when comparing the monthly mean fluxes calculated using the daily tss versus those calculated using our monthly field data flux data sometimes potentially over or underestimates monthly elemental flux by not accounting for variability in tss fig s4 primarily these occasions are associated with anomalous events that are not possible to model for example we underestimated metal flux in july 2018 when very high daily flux values were associated with the in wash of materials from storm son tinh most of the son tinh rainfall across the rrd was recorded during the 18th and 19th of july our elemental data based on the daily tss is highest on july 20th and 21st our monthly sampling took place before the storm 15th july and therefore does not capture the elevated tss from this event in addition we overestimated monthly flux at h10 during june and july 2019 this is related to the increase in discharge at ba lat in 2019 compared with 2018 fig s2 4 discussion 4 1 changes in sediment flux since 2000 since spm in rivers is a primary carrier of metal contaminants which can be toxic the amount of tss is an important measure for understanding elemental fluxes through catchments for the rrd the tss data from 2018 to 2019 measured at the hydro meteorology stations confirms the previously identified continuing decline le et al 2020 in sediment delivery to the delta since the last century table 3 the increased construction of dams in both vietnam and china between 2000 and 2015 has significantly reduced sediment delivery ha and vu 2012 le et al 2020 the data presented here updates estimates of sediment delivery based on le et al 2020 through the delta to include the major city of hanoi h5 and ba lat h10 at the mouth of the delta tss fluxes around hanoi in the mid delta at h5 are higher than upstream h3 corroborated by higher organic fluxes into the river around the city of hanoi trinh et al 2009 however a decline in sediment flux in the lower part of the delta h10 ba lat implies subsequent deposition and retention in the delta further downstream as observed between 1990 and 2015 le et al 2020 tss fluxes were lowest in the da river h3 which flows from hoa binh reservoir fig 1 table 3 confirming the impacts of the dam construction on sediment retention along the river hoa binh was constructed in 1989 the upstream dam and reservoir hoa binh is therefore likely to be acting as a barrier limiting sediment delivery and potential upstream sources of pollution downstream compared with 2010 2015 tss fluxes were higher at all sites in 2018 this tss increase is likely due to increased precipitation in 2018 20 higher than in 2019 nguyen et al 2021 which was due to the july 2018 tropical storm son tinh this storm resulted in large scale flash flooding and mudslides around yen bai h1 hoa binh h3 hanoi h5 and nam dinh h8 davies 2018 wright 2018 increased tss fluxes are therefore likely related to the in wash of eroded material from the delta rather than an increase in sediment delivery from upstream higher concentrations of elements such as li and ti which are associated with weathering and terrestrial soils in july to august at d3 d6 d10 h3 h5 h8 support this interpretation fig s3 4 2 spatial trends in element concentrations whilst the dam at hoa binh reservoir is impacting sediment delivery the low ef values of core top sediment impounded in the reservoir fig 5 suggest that pollution is occurring downstream of the dam and that the storage of sediment in hoa binh is currently of low environmental health risk models for anthropogenically derived pollution downstream of dams conclude that nutrient total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes increase overall in the coastal zone even when concentrations in reservoirs remain low see maavara et al 2020 for an overview several pollution hotspots that exceeded national level regulations and global measures of toxicity were identified downstream in the rrd fig 4 and 5 unlike other large rivers e g dupré et al 1996 elemental composition of spm in the rrd varies distinctively amongst different locations tropical storm son tinh in july 2018 exacerbated local pollution due to increased tss and in washing but across both years this spatial structure in spm suggests localised lithological and chemical influence across the rrd drainage basin and or the influence of anthropogenic land use modifications understanding the source of spm and heavy metal pollutants in the rrd is therefore an important step in implementing effective riverine ecosystem water quality policy in the catchment correlation analysis can provide insights into the source and or biogeochemical properties of elements e g zhang et al 2018 here several significant relationships were observed between small groups of elements suggesting numerous different sources of pollution for example p and mn are correlated as are fe and ti which suggests that the sources of p mn differ from fe ti the correlations between these elements could be indications of the fe phases controlling transportation e g fe hydroxide nanoparticles or ferrihydrite which is not captured by our monitoring study however despite this limitation using the approach of zhang et al 2018 and the enrichment trends depicted in fig s1 high concentrations of these elements at locations with differing land use can assist in identifying major sources of pollution in the rrd highest concentrations of p were observed at d6 downstream hanoi during the wet season while highest concentrations of fe were observed at h8 in the lower delta during the wet season agriculture is a dominant land use in both locations but d6 also receives a large amount of untreated wastewater from hanoi via the nhue river and is located close to the industrial craft villages suggesting wastewater is an important source of p to the catchment luu et al 2012 2020 luu et al 2020 have provenanced the major source of dissolved organic matter doc to be wastewater during the non fertilisation period april and october high levels of doc increase the complexation between metals and spm shafer et al 1997 our findings suggest concentrations of cd and cu were also observed at h1 furthest upstream during the dry season where the main land uses are agricultural and urban during low flows there is limited dilution of wastewater from urban areas and therefore the complexation of cd and cu with doc zhang et al 2018 may exacerbate peak concentrations associated with wastewater in the dry season pca biplots further suggest the correlation of the enrichment of cd and cu and mn and p during the wet season july luu et al 2020 found that agricultural sources linked to manure fertilisation in the day river are the predominant source of organic matter during this period they observed high doc at d8 d9 and d10 but did not include the area covering our h sites we found high concentrations of cr at d10 in july to september during the wet season fig s3 where agriculture is the primary land use cr could be supplied by in wash of agricultural and aquaculture fertilisers pesticides and algaecides as documented in the indian ganges brahmaputra meghna delta mitra and ghosh 2014 the influence of organic matter from wastewater and manure fertilisation on the complexation of cd cu and cr in the rrd should therefore be of concern to the region studies examining the relationships between doc spm and elemental partitioning kd cu kd cd and kd pb suggest that cd has affinities for both doc and silt clay dominated spm while cu displays relatively low partitioning in high clay environments which could account for the widespread high ef values of cd compared to the low cu values the effects of domestic and industrial inputs along the nhue river increases in dissolved organic matter and the consequent eutrophication luu et al 2020 and increase in cr cd and pb trinh et al 2013 are well documented in the day river however our results suggest that the large input of organic matter is also important for the mobilisation of toxic metals at a catchment wide scale in addition concentrations of as are higher than qcvn limits 17 mg kg at all sites other than h3 in the dry season arsenic rich groundwater is well documented in the rrd e g agusa et al 2005 but riverine transport of as is not often considered the presence of doc and fe oxides which is the primary component of suspended sediment in the rrd trinh et al 2013 can lead to higher dissolved as redman et al 2002 enrichment trend analysis fig s1 suggests enrichment of as and p to align corroborating that wastewater could be a significant contributor of this enrichment a reduction in inputs of doc from wastewater could therefore significantly improve dissolved and particulate pollution trinh et al 2013 suggested that the treatment of wastewater to remove organic matter from hanoi would result in the sorption of heavy metals to suspended sediment rather than organic material resulting in the deposition and storage of metals in the delta an estimated 75 of suspended sediment is retained in the delta luu et al 2012 with most deposition occurring in the upper delta before h4 between phu tho and son tay ha and coynel 2016 most deposition therefore theoretically occurs before the locations that have been identified here as major pollution hotspots d5 d6 and d7 due to a lack of hydro meteorology station tss data for the day river there is still limited understanding of sediment transport however our concentration data suggest that the day river also acts as a source with concentrations remaining high throughout unlike the hong river where high low hydro meteorological station fluxes are also evident in our concentration data table 2 furthermore a systematic reduction in sediment delivery to the delta each year table 3 will limit transportation and deposition of spm bound metals potentially increasing dissolved concentrations in addition the partition coefficient of cd kd cd gradually decreases above 5 psu turner 1996 suggesting the solubility of spm bound cd in higher salinity areas of the delta might cause further pollution downstream the removal of organic matter from wastewater will therefore not be the only requirement to limit the transportation of heavy metals from pollution hotspots 4 3 comparison with global and asian elemental fluxes there are limited annual flux estimations from other tropical river systems for comparison but values for the rrd even considering uncertainty in variability are similar to the paraíba do sul river system in brazil table 4 the average annual discharge of the rrd across the sampling period accounts for 0 07 of average global river discharge dai and trenberth 2002 the global contributions of elements from the rrd are all 0 2 with fluxes of ba contributing most most elemental fluxes are all 0 01 suggesting the rrd is not a major source of elemental pollution to the ocean the contribution of ba may appear high in relation to the discharge due to the limited comparative data for tropical rivers we cannot say with a degree of certainty whether this flux is higher than would be expected however ba and ca correlate on pca biplots fig s1b c suggesting a co variance potentially associated with the weathering of limestone for comparison using the discharge estimates given in ovalle et al 2013 the annual average discharge of the paraíba do sul are similar accounting for 0 05 of global river discharge but elemental fluxes are proportionately higher than the rrd the difference may be accounted for by the deposition of material in the much larger and older deltaic environment of the rrd compared with the paraíba do sul delta where a larger area of the delta is prograding murillo et al 2009 progradation results in lower sediment accumulation than where a large delta plain has formed and could account for more export to the oceans hori 2021 this suggests that the rrd deltaic fan is effectively filtering and retaining sediments despite clear evidence of sediment deposition in the rrd the flux of elements suggests higher concentrations being exported from the delta than entering around 78 of spm derives from upstream in china ha and coynel 2016 and a high level of sediment retention occurs in the mid and lower delta between h5 and h10 luu et al 2010 however high fluxes in the lower delta suggest that most pollution is occurring in the delta itself in some instances there is a low percentage increase between the input and output despite areas of significant pollution ef above 5 occurring downstream at d5 and d6 for example the lowest percentage increase in 2018 is in the flux of cr suggesting deposition has taken place further downstream in the day river in general fluxes from the day river are lower than the hong river despite concentrations of several elements suggesting d5 d6 and d7 are pollution hotspots the higher fluxes from the hong river are likely due to higher discharge h4 3866 m3 s in 2018 and 2612 m3 s in 2019 compared with 5032 m3 s and 3577 m3 s at the outflows the lower discharge of the day river reduces its capacity to transport spm and consequently increases the potential to become a sink of deposited contaminants where there is the mixing of marine and freshwaters dissolved metal species fe mn al p zn cu ni co pb and mo from river water can be transferred into suspended state eckert and sholkovitz 1976 boyle et al 1977 sholkovitz 1978 sholkovitz et al 1978 higher fluxes of all particle bound elements except ca at d10 and h10 fig 6 are associated with marine influenced waters fig 3 suggesting tidal influence and the increase in flux due to mixing and increased recorded discharge during our sampling period the marine influence only extended to h10 but other studies have monitored tidal influence up to 100 km inland minh et al 2014 and with future projections of more extreme saline intrusion duc and umeyama 2011 the effects of salinity could increase the pollution of suspended sediments with toxic metals in more areas of the delta 5 conclusions the results suggest that the contribution of heavy metals to the global oceans from the rrd are relatively small 0 2 of global riverine elemental fluxes however areas of extreme pollution within the catchment are highlighted via our spatial data previous work in the rrd has suggested an extension in heavily polluted areas immediately surrounding hanoi to pollution of the previously high quality upstream section of the day river since 2013 results presented here suggest that the areas receiving pollution from hanoi d6 and d7 are extremely polluted with ef values 40 in addition due to rapid urbanisation and industrialisation in the catchment upstream sections of the hong river e g h5 are also experiencing extreme pollution whilst reducing the amount of untreated wastewater and therefore organic matter entering the riverine system would limit the mobility of suspended metals the chemical composition of inputs to the rrd would need to be monitored to assess heavy metal increase in the sediments of the delta furthermore future increased monsoon intensity and saline intrusion could lead to the increased in washing of material and the solubility of spm bound metals in a larger percentage of the delta potentially leading to toxic levels of metals currently on average 50 of toxic metal flux is deposited within the delta or integrated into the riverine food web however increased in washing of pollutants and future projected increases in monsoon intensity saline intrusion and increased human activity could shift the delta to be a

15495,due to the depositional environment river deltas are said to act as filters and sinks for pollutants however many deltas are also densely populated and rapidly urbanizing creating new and increased sources of pollutants these sources pose the risk of tipping these environments from pollution sinks to sources to the world s oceans we provide detailed seasonal and annual assessments of metal contaminants in riverine suspended particulate matter spm across the densely populated red river delta rrd vietnam the global contributions of elements from the rrd are all 0 2 with many elemental fluxes 0 01 suggesting the rrd is not a major source of elemental pollution to the ocean however hotspots of metal pollution due to human activity and the impacts of tropical storm son tinh july 2018 exceed both national level regulations and international measures of toxicity e g enrichment factors there is widespread extreme pollution of cd enrichment factor 40 and concentrations of as higher than national regulation limits 17 mg kg at all sites other than one upstream agricultural dominated tributary in the dry season these hotspots are characterised by high inputs of organic matter e g manure fertiliser and urban wastewater which influences elemental mobility in the particulate and dissolved phases and are potentially significant sources of pollution downstream in addition in the marine and fresh water mixing zone salinity effects metal complexation with organic matter increasing metals in the particulate phase our calculations indicate that the delta is currently acting as a pollutant sink as determined by high levels of pollutant deposition 50 however increased in washing of pollutants and future projected increases in monsoon intensity saline intrusion and human activity could shift the delta to become a source of toxic metals we show the importance of monitoring environmental parameters primarily dissolved organic matter and salinity in the rrd to assess the risk of transport and accumulation of toxic metals in the delta sediments which can lead to net increases in anthropogenic pollution in the coastal zone and the incorporation of toxic elements in the food chain keywords elemental flux suspended particulate matter anthropogenic pollution sediment transport tropical deltas data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large rivers are the main source of eroded material into the world s oceans with 70 of global suspended particulate matter spm derived from rivers in southern asia the large pacific and the indian ocean islands viers et al 2009 riverine spm comprises inorganic e g clay minerals and iron manganese fe mn oxyhydroxides and organic detritic or living matter and is the primary carrier of heavy metals in fluvial systems large asian rivers are therefore important in global biogeochemical cycles and the transport of pollutants through watersheds on average 90 of riverine spm is deposited in estuaries and deltas martin and whitfield 1983 making south and southeast asian mega deltas a potentially significant sink of pollutants the primary sources of metals in riverine spm are from atmospheric deposition weathering of catchment materials and anthropogenic inputs e g agricultural runoff the textural composition and organic matter of sediments is critical in determining the sorption and complexation of transition metals jenne 1968 warren and zimmerman 1994 with the mineralogy and grain size of silts and clays predominantly carrying metal contamination from upstream e g roy et al 2018 the amount of spm delivered by rivers therefore depends on 1 natural catchment controls including relief surface area geology vegetation type and cover and climate temperature precipitation runoff intensity and number of flood events and 2 anthropogenic activities and catchment modifications including industry agriculture land cover and the diversion of flow furthermore sediments are transported downstream or deposited as bottom sediments but natural e g flooding and anthropogenic e g dredging activities can lead to their resuspension asian mega deltas such as the red river delta rrd in vietnam deliver 30 of global suspended sediment to the oceans samanta and dalai 2018 excess sediment in coastal environments can lead to increased turbidity with negative impacts on endangered benthic marine organisms such as coral reefs and increases in the net contribution of anthropogenic pollutants to the coastal zone asian mega deltas are some of the most densely populated and urbanizing environments in the world ericson et al 2006 woodroffe et al 2006 increasing the input of suspended matter and pollutants to the coast however estimates of annual fluxes of pollutants through such deltas are still limited here we provide the first detailed multi seasonal assessment of river spm elemental composition and contamination for the rrd vietnam 1 1 the red river delta the rrd northern vietnam is the fourth largest delta in southeast asia spanning 14 300 km2 fig 1 the monsoonal climate annual rainfall 700 4800 mm yr 1 has a rainy season from may to october up to 80 of rainfall and a dry season from november to april spm is therefore highly seasonal le et al 2020 the delta is situated 3 m above sea level and throughout the quaternary eustatic sea level changes have shifted the boundary between fluvial and marine dominated environments today tidal effects can be seen in river levels at phu ly located close to d6 fig 1c and during the dry season they can extend up to hanoi h5 fig 1c minh et al 2014 the fluvial network of the delta is dense 2 4 km km2 extending 1126 km from the source in china to the mouth at ba lat estuary tran 2007 on entry to vietnam the river known as the thao river receives water from the da river and the lo river it enters the deltaic area as the red hong river at son tay h4 fig 1 where it then divides to the day river and duong river the duong river flows eastwards and drains out of the delta area fig 1c the main channel continues to flow through hanoi to ba lat fig 1 the day river to the right of the main channel has a length of 240 km and a watershed area of 8500 km2 of river discharge 21 is derived from the upper red river in china with 54 and 25 derived from the da and lo rivers respectively however an estimated 78 of spm is eroded from upstream in china ha and coynel 2016 the dense river network with easy access to water has encouraged settlement with a population of 21 million growing annually by 1 14 general statistic office 2018 2020 and a rapid increase of industry and agriculture in 2017 37 of land was used for agriculture general statistic office 2017 and there were 731 traditional so called craft villages specialising in a variety of industries including textiles food processing ceramic works and recycling plants mahanty et al 2012 waste products from domestic activities agriculture and industry including nutrients and heavy metal pollution enter the river network unregulated and untreated quynh et al 2005 luu et al 2012 mahanty et al 2012 consequently air and water pollution in 90 of craft villages throughout vietnam exceed the limits required under the law on environmental protection monre 2008 the world bank 2008 epa 2009 with a monitoring record covering 21 years since 2000 trinh et al 2009 the rrd is one of the best studied tropical river systems whilst industrial and agricultural pollution of the rrd are well studied and often quantified e g luu et al 2012 mahanty et al 2012 ha and coynel 2016 there is minimal information on seasonal and annual fluxes of suspended elements through the catchment elements in the dissolved phase e g cr from mining and craft villages have been documented mahanty et al 2012 around hanoi and the bioaccumulation of metals zn cu and cd has been quantified for the nhue day river basin ngo et al 2021 however potential widespread pollution due to the transport resuspension and deposition of spm across the delta remains largely unknown previous work has focused on either the red e g le et al 2018 or day nhue catchments e g do and nishida 2014 do et al 2019 luu et al 2020 ngo et al 2021 high suspended sediment fluxes in the red river in combination with numerous pollution sources lead to a high proportion of trace metals in the particulate phase trinh et al 2013 therefore we aimed to provide a more complete overview of sediment and pollutant flux from 18 locations across the rrd over a 18 month period from february 2018 to july 2019 quantifying the annual fluxes of pollutants in the rrd and its contribution to global biogeochemical cycles for the first time 2 methods 2 1 field collections eighteen sampling points were located at key parts of the red 10 stations and day nhue rivers 8 stations covering a range of land uses table 1 to characterise spatial and temporal trends in sediment delivery and metal contamination across the rrd sites are labelled as h and d respectively upstream site h1 is located at the thao river after the river enters vietnam from china the delta starts at son tay h4 and the river flows through the east side of hanoi city at h5 fig 1 the upstream catchment h1 h4 has a low population density 100 inhabitant km2 and high forest cover le et al 2020 the remaining portion of the catchment has a very high population density 1000 inhabitant km2 intensive agriculture and urban pollution le et al 2020 the nhue river receives wastewater from hanoi city h5 and enters the day river upstream of d6 fig 1 introducing further potential contaminants into the day river in addition the expansion of hydropower and associated impoundments in the catchment has reduced sediment delivery le et al 2020 and introduced the potential for downstream storage of contaminants from urban and agricultural wastewater the 18 locations were sampled monthly between february 2018 and july 2019 fig 1 across a range of land uses table 1 at each location water was sampled at 50 cm depth and filtered using gf f 0 7 µm filter papers between 300 1000 ml of water was filtered until adequate suspended sediment was retained on the filter paper table s1 filter papers were pre weighed and ashed at 550 c prior to collection two filter papers were retained for the calculation of total suspended solids tss and heavy trace metal concentration for analysis of major ions to characterise waters of marine composition a 30 ml aliquot of filtered water was retained and stored at 10 c to permit a comparison of upstream contaminant storage in the rrd catchment and examine the effects of impoundment on the transport of elements core top sediments 0 1 cm from a 61 cm sediment core collected from hoa binh reservoir in 2017 were retained for icp ms analysis 2 2 hydrological data to calculate the element fluxes of particulate matter in the rrd daily river discharge m3 s was obtained from nine hydrological stations in the upstream sites h1 h3 and downstream sites h4 h5 h7 h8 h9 h10 reaches of the red river there are no hydrological stations recording river discharge in the right branch of the red river or the day nhue river basin d sites instead four stations record daily water level cm ba tha d3 phu ly d6 gian khau h6 and nhu tan d10 water level data were provided by the centre of hydro meteorology hmd vietnam centre for hydro meteorological data http cmh com vn en to derive discharge for 2018 2019 the water level discharge relationships in luu et al 2010 were used to investigate the seasonal patterns in discharge across the delta z scores were calculated to compare amongst sites a z score calculates the standard deviation relative to the mean to standardize the data and allow seasonal patterns to be highlighted a monthly z score was calculated for each hydrological station and subsequently used to generate a mean z score for the rrd as a whole using the following equation 1 z x μ σ where x is the hydro meteorology station monthly mean discharge μ is the rrd mean annual discharge and σ is the standard deviation of rrd annual discharge 2 3 water ionic composition to delineate the marine influence and therefore the effects of salinity on element partitioning dissolved major ions na mg k ca cl and so4 2 were analysed filtered waters were analysed by ion chromatography according to the methods described in apha 2017 and corrected for cyclic salts total alkalinity was determined by the single point titration method using methyl orange as a colouring indicator according to methods described in clesceri et al 1999 2 4 total suspended sediment tss filter papers were dried at 105 c for 24 hrs and weighed after cooling in a desiccator tss values including organic matter were then calculated as follows 2 tss mg l 1 weigh t 1 mg weigh t 2 mg x 10 3 volume ml where weight1 is the final weight of the filters and weight2 is the initial dry weight of the filter tss is monitored daily at the national hydro meteorology stations yen bai hoa binh vu quang hanoi and ba lat table 1 using the same filtration method and 1 l of water monthly averages and one standard deviation of tss were calculated from these daily measurements and compared with our one off monthly value in most cases our value falls within one standard deviation of their mean monthly tss value suggesting our data are representative of monthly tss since the values are representative the hydro meteorology station tss is not available at all sites and the method is most comparable to the collection of spm for elemental analysis our monthly measurements of tss were used for the calculation of elemental fluxes daily spm elemental fluxes were calculated using daily hydro meteorology station tss data at the appropriate stations to provide an idea of the variability in flux calculations text s1 tss fluxes were not calculated based on our tss data because the 2019 sampling period only covered half of the year until july 2019 and modelling the data for the remainder of the year would introduce uncertainty into the calculation whereas the hydro meteorology station tss provides daily data for the full 12 months providing a more accurate calculation of flux furthermore the use of the hydro meteorology station data allowed comparison with historical trends 2 5 suspended particulate matter spm geochemistry 2 5 1 heavy and trace metal concentrations filter papers were freeze dried and weighed directly into microwave vessels to which 5 ml of concentrated hno3 and 0 1 ml hf was added vessels were left to settle for 30 min before sealing the vessels were heated via a ramping programme to 200 c using a cem mars microwave system cooled before venting to prevent the release of volatiles e g si and 0 5 ml of h2o2 added heating cooling and venting was repeated for a second cycle before solutions were transferred to savellex containers and dried gently at 90 c overnight on a hotplate the residue was reconstituted with 1 ml concentrated hno3 heated for 30 min at 30 c and made up to a total volume of 10 ml with deionised water blank filters were analysed with each microwave batch for subsequent blank correction after analysis two additional blank filters were spiked with a certified reference material nist 2584 within each microwave batch as a measure of reproducibility and accuracy for the dissolution stage analysis of sample solutions was undertaken using an agilent 8900 series icp qqq ms to overcome polyatomic interferences the icp ms collision cell was operated in he mode at a flow rate of 5 5 ml min 1 for all elements except p and as for these elements o2 was introduced into the cell at a flow rate of 30 in conjunction with ms ms determination to measure the oxide product ion e g 75as16o quality control qc standards were analysed at the start and end of each run and after no more than every 20 samples 2 5 2 annual flux estimation january to december is defined here as the annual cycle to allow comparison with previous work in the rrd e g luu et al 2010 le et al 2020 and to give equal weighting to wet and dry seasons of 6 months each annual fluxes of tss were calculated using the daily hydro meteorology station data and the calculation used in le et al 2020 3 flux 10 6 ty r 1 c i q i 24 60 60

and x al is the concentration of the selected element normalised to the concentration of al in the sample upper continental crust ucc values were taken from taylor and mclennan 1985 mclennan 2001 rudnick and gao 2003 and hu and gao 2008 to determine the degree of anthropogenic enrichment the contamination categories of sutherland 2000 were used text s2 ef values were also calculated for the global average spm and a range of asian rivers text s1 where the average spm ef value across the catchment for the sampling period was below 2 suggesting geogenic origin the element is excluded from further discussion but is presented alongside other flux calculations annual spm metal fluxes were calculated for each sampling location using 5 flux 10 3 tyr 1 c d x tss d x q d x 0 0846 where cd is the concentration mg kg of a given element on the sampling day tssd is the total suspended sediment on the given sampling day mg l 1 q d is the daily discharge m3 s and 0 0846 is the conversion factor to tonnes the measured tss from the field collected filter paper was used in this equation to best reflect the spm concentration collected at the same time this was calculated for each sampling day and regression curves using a power function flux aqb table s3 were developed to estimate fluxes for the remaining days the annual flux was the sum of daily fluxes which could then be compared to other tropical rivers and used to calculate inflow and outflow text s2 3 results 3 1 hydro meteorology station discharge mean monthly rrd discharge varies seasonally with peak discharge during the wet season may to october fig 2 a discharge between 2018 and 2019 was highly variable across the catchment fig 2b which is reflected in the high standard deviations in monthly rrd z score discharge fig 2a over the sampling period the highest and most variable discharges were recorded at son tay fig 2b variability in discharge was lowest at ba tha gian khau and phy ly located on the day river d sites fig 2b discharge was lower in 2019 than 2018 at all hydro meteorology stations other than ba lat located at the mouth of the hong river the seasonality in mean rrd discharge is also displayed in the mean monthly discharge at each hydro meteorology station fig s2 text s3 3 2 marine versus freshwater influence dissolved ionic composition of waters from h10 hong river in the lower part of the delta sit in the hydrochemical space of na k cl dominance typical of marine waters fig 3 in contrast the remaining sites were ca2 dominated and are typical of freshwaters marine or freshwater ionic composition was unaltered during the wet and dry seasons other than in january 2019 dry season at d10 at the mouth of the day river when waters were of marine composition suggesting some saline intrusion with reduced freshwater inflow fig 3 3 3 tss concentrations from our sampling average tss concentrations were highest at the most upstream site h1 an annual average of 152 59 114 81 1σ mg l 1 in 2018 and 114 37 124 87 mg l 1 in 2019 and lowest at h3 annual averages of 9 10 9 20 mg l 1 and 4 81 6 39 mg l 1 located on the da river tributary table 2 tss concentrations were often highest in the wet season table 2 except for in a few sites in the mid delta d7 d8 in 2019 d10 in 2019 and h6 in 2018 it is important to note that our sampling for 2019 only covers january to july and therefore the values are not directly comparable to 2018 which covers february to december for monthly concentrations consult table s4 daily tss concentrations at hydro meteorology stations are not used in the calculation of elemental fluxes but concentrations were compared to see if one off monthly sampling precisely reflected monthly tss in most cases our value falls within one standard deviation of their mean monthly tss value for detailed comparison see text s4 3 4 metal concentration of spm seasonal trends in suspended metal concentrations were spatially variable across the rrd catchment fig s3 text s5 for metal concentrations in riverine sediments the vietnamese national technical regulation on sediment quality sets limits for cr cu as cd and pb table s7 qcvn 43 2017 btnmt concentrations of as were high at all sites across the rrd exceeding the qcvn limits for at least two months of the year in both the wet and dry seasons fig 4 in general concentrations were lowest in h3 the da river flowing from hoa binh reservoir whereas concentrations exceeded limits for sediments in both fresh and brackish waters at numerous sites in the day river d sites for cr cu cd and pb concentrations at most sites were below the limits set by qcvn fig 4 with the exception of the upstream site of h1 during the dry season march and april in 2018 in march 2019 concentrations of cu were close within 10 mg kg to the limit particulate concentrations of cr were more distinctively seasonal with concentrations above qcvn limits in the wet season june to october at all sites other than h1 furthest upstream and h10 at the mouth of the river strong significant positive correlations p 0 001 were observed in both the wet and dry seasons between fe and ti r 0 933 and 0 910 in the wet season between p and mn r 0 943 and cr and cd r 0 939 and in the dry season between cr and cu r 0 998 and cd and pb r 0 961 significant p 0 005 but weak negative correlations r 0 4 were observed between p and ti p and fe ti and cr ti and mn ti and cd cr and fe mn and fe mn and ba fe and cd and cd and ba these negative correlations were observed in wet and dry seasons 3 4 1 enrichment factors average rrd ef values for mg k ca and ti were below 2 suggesting geogenic origin however values for some locations suggest moderate mg k ca ti localised pollution primarily around sites d5 to d7 located around hanoi fig 5 enrichment factors for four elements mn as cd ba were 40 at one location suggesting extreme pollution average rrd ef values were 40 extreme pollution and above the global average value for cd and ba cd values were 40 at all sites in the rrd and were above the global average at h1 h5 h8 and d5 the highest average ef of 933 at d5 hanoi suggests high localised pollution for ba values for all sites in the rrd were higher than the average global and asian values an ef value of 137 for ba at h3 located on the tributary flowing from hoa binh reservoir suggests a pollution hotspot there are several elements where ef values indicate moderate pollution but were lower than the average values for asian rivers including ni average rrd ef of 4 and pb average rrd ef of 7 for all elements the ef values for core top sediments in hoa binh were lower than the average value for the rrd suggesting significant anthropogenic pollution downstream however ef values highlight moderate pollution of cr mn ni and cu significant pollution of as and extreme pollution of cd 3 5 annual fluxes of tss and elements annual fluxes of tss estimated from the hydro meteorological station data for yen bai h1 vu quang h2 hoa binh h3 hanoi h5 and ba lat h10 are presented in table 3 unlike our sampling data the tss data from the hydro meteorology station is available for all months of 2018 and 2019 the highest annual flux was estimated for h1 furthest upstream with 23 5 106 tonnes yr 1 in 2018 and the lowest at hoa binh of 0 3 106 tonnes yr 1 in 2019 the annual tss flux in 2019 was lower at all hydro meteorology stations when compared with previous data from le et al 2020 the tss flux for yen bai in 2018 is anomalously high compared with the 2010 2019 period but 2019 is more similar to fluxes between 2010 and 2015 at 9 2 106 tonnes yr 1 table 3 for vu quang and hoa binh the 2018 and 2019 flux shows a steady decline since 2010 2015 in agreement with previous trends higher fluxes of all elements in particulate form were exported from the hong river than the day river and fluxes were substantially higher in 2018 table 4 higher fluxes of li mg k ca cu and as were associated with the upper delta whereas fluxes of al p ti cr mn fe ni cd pb were higher in the middle delta annual fluxes of cu ba c and n were highest in the lower section of the delta fluxes of li mg p ti cr mn fe ni cu as cd ba and pb decreased between the upstream and middle section of the delta before increasing at d10 and h10 where the delta is influenced by marine waters fig 6 fluxes of all elements were highest in the upstream section of the delta h1 h5 with fluxes at h4 and h5 around hanoi being substantially higher for most elements fig 6 the elemental flux entering the delta at d6 h6 and h4 was lower than that exported from d10 h9 h10 h7 and thuong cat by an average of 48 08 in 2018 and 50 46 in 2019 the greatest increases were exhibited by mg 87 27 in 2018 and 86 85 in 2019 and least by cr 29 48 and ca 20 26 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 5 when comparing the monthly mean fluxes calculated using the daily tss versus those calculated using our monthly field data flux data sometimes potentially over or underestimates monthly elemental flux by not accounting for variability in tss fig s4 primarily these occasions are associated with anomalous events that are not possible to model for example we underestimated metal flux in july 2018 when very high daily flux values were associated with the in wash of materials from storm son tinh most of the son tinh rainfall across the rrd was recorded during the 18th and 19th of july our elemental data based on the daily tss is highest on july 20th and 21st our monthly sampling took place before the storm 15th july and therefore does not capture the elevated tss from this event in addition we overestimated monthly flux at h10 during june and july 2019 this is related to the increase in discharge at ba lat in 2019 compared with 2018 fig s2 4 discussion 4 1 changes in sediment flux since 2000 since spm in rivers is a primary carrier of metal contaminants which can be toxic the amount of tss is an important measure for understanding elemental fluxes through catchments for the rrd the tss data from 2018 to 2019 measured at the hydro meteorology stations confirms the previously identified continuing decline le et al 2020 in sediment delivery to the delta since the last century table 3 the increased construction of dams in both vietnam and china between 2000 and 2015 has significantly reduced sediment delivery ha and vu 2012 le et al 2020 the data presented here updates estimates of sediment delivery based on le et al 2020 through the delta to include the major city of hanoi h5 and ba lat h10 at the mouth of the delta tss fluxes around hanoi in the mid delta at h5 are higher than upstream h3 corroborated by higher organic fluxes into the river around the city of hanoi trinh et al 2009 however a decline in sediment flux in the lower part of the delta h10 ba lat implies subsequent deposition and retention in the delta further downstream as observed between 1990 and 2015 le et al 2020 tss fluxes were lowest in the da river h3 which flows from hoa binh reservoir fig 1 table 3 confirming the impacts of the dam construction on sediment retention along the river hoa binh was constructed in 1989 the upstream dam and reservoir hoa binh is therefore likely to be acting as a barrier limiting sediment delivery and potential upstream sources of pollution downstream compared with 2010 2015 tss fluxes were higher at all sites in 2018 this tss increase is likely due to increased precipitation in 2018 20 higher than in 2019 nguyen et al 2021 which was due to the july 2018 tropical storm son tinh this storm resulted in large scale flash flooding and mudslides around yen bai h1 hoa binh h3 hanoi h5 and nam dinh h8 davies 2018 wright 2018 increased tss fluxes are therefore likely related to the in wash of eroded material from the delta rather than an increase in sediment delivery from upstream higher concentrations of elements such as li and ti which are associated with weathering and terrestrial soils in july to august at d3 d6 d10 h3 h5 h8 support this interpretation fig s3 4 2 spatial trends in element concentrations whilst the dam at hoa binh reservoir is impacting sediment delivery the low ef values of core top sediment impounded in the reservoir fig 5 suggest that pollution is occurring downstream of the dam and that the storage of sediment in hoa binh is currently of low environmental health risk models for anthropogenically derived pollution downstream of dams conclude that nutrient total nitrogen and total phosphorus fluxes increase overall in the coastal zone even when concentrations in reservoirs remain low see maavara et al 2020 for an overview several pollution hotspots that exceeded national level regulations and global measures of toxicity were identified downstream in the rrd fig 4 and 5 unlike other large rivers e g dupré et al 1996 elemental composition of spm in the rrd varies distinctively amongst different locations tropical storm son tinh in july 2018 exacerbated local pollution due to increased tss and in washing but across both years this spatial structure in spm suggests localised lithological and chemical influence across the rrd drainage basin and or the influence of anthropogenic land use modifications understanding the source of spm and heavy metal pollutants in the rrd is therefore an important step in implementing effective riverine ecosystem water quality policy in the catchment correlation analysis can provide insights into the source and or biogeochemical properties of elements e g zhang et al 2018 here several significant relationships were observed between small groups of elements suggesting numerous different sources of pollution for example p and mn are correlated as are fe and ti which suggests that the sources of p mn differ from fe ti the correlations between these elements could be indications of the fe phases controlling transportation e g fe hydroxide nanoparticles or ferrihydrite which is not captured by our monitoring study however despite this limitation using the approach of zhang et al 2018 and the enrichment trends depicted in fig s1 high concentrations of these elements at locations with differing land use can assist in identifying major sources of pollution in the rrd highest concentrations of p were observed at d6 downstream hanoi during the wet season while highest concentrations of fe were observed at h8 in the lower delta during the wet season agriculture is a dominant land use in both locations but d6 also receives a large amount of untreated wastewater from hanoi via the nhue river and is located close to the industrial craft villages suggesting wastewater is an important source of p to the catchment luu et al 2012 2020 luu et al 2020 have provenanced the major source of dissolved organic matter doc to be wastewater during the non fertilisation period april and october high levels of doc increase the complexation between metals and spm shafer et al 1997 our findings suggest concentrations of cd and cu were also observed at h1 furthest upstream during the dry season where the main land uses are agricultural and urban during low flows there is limited dilution of wastewater from urban areas and therefore the complexation of cd and cu with doc zhang et al 2018 may exacerbate peak concentrations associated with wastewater in the dry season pca biplots further suggest the correlation of the enrichment of cd and cu and mn and p during the wet season july luu et al 2020 found that agricultural sources linked to manure fertilisation in the day river are the predominant source of organic matter during this period they observed high doc at d8 d9 and d10 but did not include the area covering our h sites we found high concentrations of cr at d10 in july to september during the wet season fig s3 where agriculture is the primary land use cr could be supplied by in wash of agricultural and aquaculture fertilisers pesticides and algaecides as documented in the indian ganges brahmaputra meghna delta mitra and ghosh 2014 the influence of organic matter from wastewater and manure fertilisation on the complexation of cd cu and cr in the rrd should therefore be of concern to the region studies examining the relationships between doc spm and elemental partitioning kd cu kd cd and kd pb suggest that cd has affinities for both doc and silt clay dominated spm while cu displays relatively low partitioning in high clay environments which could account for the widespread high ef values of cd compared to the low cu values the effects of domestic and industrial inputs along the nhue river increases in dissolved organic matter and the consequent eutrophication luu et al 2020 and increase in cr cd and pb trinh et al 2013 are well documented in the day river however our results suggest that the large input of organic matter is also important for the mobilisation of toxic metals at a catchment wide scale in addition concentrations of as are higher than qcvn limits 17 mg kg at all sites other than h3 in the dry season arsenic rich groundwater is well documented in the rrd e g agusa et al 2005 but riverine transport of as is not often considered the presence of doc and fe oxides which is the primary component of suspended sediment in the rrd trinh et al 2013 can lead to higher dissolved as redman et al 2002 enrichment trend analysis fig s1 suggests enrichment of as and p to align corroborating that wastewater could be a significant contributor of this enrichment a reduction in inputs of doc from wastewater could therefore significantly improve dissolved and particulate pollution trinh et al 2013 suggested that the treatment of wastewater to remove organic matter from hanoi would result in the sorption of heavy metals to suspended sediment rather than organic material resulting in the deposition and storage of metals in the delta an estimated 75 of suspended sediment is retained in the delta luu et al 2012 with most deposition occurring in the upper delta before h4 between phu tho and son tay ha and coynel 2016 most deposition therefore theoretically occurs before the locations that have been identified here as major pollution hotspots d5 d6 and d7 due to a lack of hydro meteorology station tss data for the day river there is still limited understanding of sediment transport however our concentration data suggest that the day river also acts as a source with concentrations remaining high throughout unlike the hong river where high low hydro meteorological station fluxes are also evident in our concentration data table 2 furthermore a systematic reduction in sediment delivery to the delta each year table 3 will limit transportation and deposition of spm bound metals potentially increasing dissolved concentrations in addition the partition coefficient of cd kd cd gradually decreases above 5 psu turner 1996 suggesting the solubility of spm bound cd in higher salinity areas of the delta might cause further pollution downstream the removal of organic matter from wastewater will therefore not be the only requirement to limit the transportation of heavy metals from pollution hotspots 4 3 comparison with global and asian elemental fluxes there are limited annual flux estimations from other tropical river systems for comparison but values for the rrd even considering uncertainty in variability are similar to the paraíba do sul river system in brazil table 4 the average annual discharge of the rrd across the sampling period accounts for 0 07 of average global river discharge dai and trenberth 2002 the global contributions of elements from the rrd are all 0 2 with fluxes of ba contributing most most elemental fluxes are all 0 01 suggesting the rrd is not a major source of elemental pollution to the ocean the contribution of ba may appear high in relation to the discharge due to the limited comparative data for tropical rivers we cannot say with a degree of certainty whether this flux is higher than would be expected however ba and ca correlate on pca biplots fig s1b c suggesting a co variance potentially associated with the weathering of limestone for comparison using the discharge estimates given in ovalle et al 2013 the annual average discharge of the paraíba do sul are similar accounting for 0 05 of global river discharge but elemental fluxes are proportionately higher than the rrd the difference may be accounted for by the deposition of material in the much larger and older deltaic environment of the rrd compared with the paraíba do sul delta where a larger area of the delta is prograding murillo et al 2009 progradation results in lower sediment accumulation than where a large delta plain has formed and could account for more export to the oceans hori 2021 this suggests that the rrd deltaic fan is effectively filtering and retaining sediments despite clear evidence of sediment deposition in the rrd the flux of elements suggests higher concentrations being exported from the delta than entering around 78 of spm derives from upstream in china ha and coynel 2016 and a high level of sediment retention occurs in the mid and lower delta between h5 and h10 luu et al 2010 however high fluxes in the lower delta suggest that most pollution is occurring in the delta itself in some instances there is a low percentage increase between the input and output despite areas of significant pollution ef above 5 occurring downstream at d5 and d6 for example the lowest percentage increase in 2018 is in the flux of cr suggesting deposition has taken place further downstream in the day river in general fluxes from the day river are lower than the hong river despite concentrations of several elements suggesting d5 d6 and d7 are pollution hotspots the higher fluxes from the hong river are likely due to higher discharge h4 3866 m3 s in 2018 and 2612 m3 s in 2019 compared with 5032 m3 s and 3577 m3 s at the outflows the lower discharge of the day river reduces its capacity to transport spm and consequently increases the potential to become a sink of deposited contaminants where there is the mixing of marine and freshwaters dissolved metal species fe mn al p zn cu ni co pb and mo from river water can be transferred into suspended state eckert and sholkovitz 1976 boyle et al 1977 sholkovitz 1978 sholkovitz et al 1978 higher fluxes of all particle bound elements except ca at d10 and h10 fig 6 are associated with marine influenced waters fig 3 suggesting tidal influence and the increase in flux due to mixing and increased recorded discharge during our sampling period the marine influence only extended to h10 but other studies have monitored tidal influence up to 100 km inland minh et al 2014 and with future projections of more extreme saline intrusion duc and umeyama 2011 the effects of salinity could increase the pollution of suspended sediments with toxic metals in more areas of the delta 5 conclusions the results suggest that the contribution of heavy metals to the global oceans from the rrd are relatively small 0 2 of global riverine elemental fluxes however areas of extreme pollution within the catchment are highlighted via our spatial data previous work in the rrd has suggested an extension in heavily polluted areas immediately surrounding hanoi to pollution of the previously high quality upstream section of the day river since 2013 results presented here suggest that the areas receiving pollution from hanoi d6 and d7 are extremely polluted with ef values 40 in addition due to rapid urbanisation and industrialisation in the catchment upstream sections of the hong river e g h5 are also experiencing extreme pollution whilst reducing the amount of untreated wastewater and therefore organic matter entering the riverine system would limit the mobility of suspended metals the chemical composition of inputs to the rrd would need to be monitored to assess heavy metal increase in the sediments of the delta furthermore future increased monsoon intensity and saline intrusion could lead to the increased in washing of material and the solubility of spm bound metals in a larger percentage of the delta potentially leading to toxic levels of metals currently on average 50 of toxic metal flux is deposited within the delta or integrated into the riverine food web however increased in washing of pollutants and future projected increases in monsoon intensity saline intrusion and increased human activity could shift the delta to be a

15496,saline mariculture wastewater containing multi antibiotics poses a challenge to anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox process herein the halophilic marine anammox bacteria mab based microbiome was used for treating mariculture wastewater 35 salinity under multi antibiotics enrofloxacin oxytetracycline sulfamethoxazole eos stress and the main focus of this study lies in the response of mab based microbiome against multi antibiotics stress it is found that mab based microbiome shows stable community structure and contributes high nitrogen removal efficiency 90 even under high stress of eos up to 4 mg l 1 the relative abundance of main functional genus candidatus scalindua responsible for anammox had little change while controlling the influent eos concentration within 4 mg l 1 whereas significantly decreased to 2 23 at eos concentration of as high as 24 mg l 1 as an alternative antibiotic resistance bacteria arb species rheinheimera dominated the microbial community of mab based biological reactor under extremely high eos stress e g 24 mg l 1 in influent the response mechanism of mab based microbiome consists of extracellular and intracellular defenses with dependence of eos concentration for example while eos within 4 mg l 1 in this study most of the antibiotics were retained by extracellular polymeric substances eps via adsorption if increasing the eos concentration to 8 and even 24 mg l 1 part of antibiotics could intrude into the cells and cause the intracellular accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes args total abundance up to 2 44 10 1 copies 16s rrna for eos response these new understandings will facilitate the practical implementation of mab based bioprocess for saline nitrogen and antibiotics laden wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords marine anammox bacteria mariculture wastewater antibiotics saline nitrogen removal 1 introduction with the fast development of the mariculture and seafood processing industry the massive emission of saline mariculture wastewater threatened the marine ecosystem and human health huang et al 2021 in addition to nitrogen compounds and organic carbon mariculture wastewater contained high levels of salts and multiple antibiotics lu et al 2021a unlike other industrial wastewater mariculture wastewater usually has low organic matter concentration and these organic carbon in wastewater can be easily removed by microbial degradation wu et al 2022 however high salinity in mariculture wastewater could increase cell osmotic pressure resulting in cell plasmolysis and death li et al 2018 in addition only 20 30 of antibiotics added in mariculture systems were absorbed by organisms li et al 2017 leading to large amounts of residual antibiotics were detected in mariculture wastewater álvarez muñoz et al 2015 serra compte et al 2019 in saline mariculture wastewater the maximum value of oxytetracycline otc concentration even reached 9 46 mg l 1 in jeju island south korea and 15 13 mg l 1 in hailing island china respectively wang et al 2022 due to the discharge of mariculture wastewater high concentration mg l 1 level of enrofloxacin enr otc and sulfamethoxazole smx were frequently detected in the seawater and submarine sediment han et al 2021 microorganisms would be suppressed or even killed under antibiotic stress fan et al 2021 the residue of antibiotics accelerated the spread and enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes args by horizontal and vertical gene transfer hgt and vgt yan et al 2019 therefore an antibiotic resistance and salt tolerance nitrogen removal bioprocess should be developed to treat mariculture wastewater anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is an efficient and economical autotrophic nitrogen removal process which has been applied in sewage treatment plants li et al 2022 coupling processes such as denitrification or nitrification were needed to removal carbon and supply no2 n for anammox lackner et al 2014 wu et al 2022 however because anammox bacteria have long double time sequencing batch reactor sbr can benefit them to grow and resist to detrimental surroundings zhang et al 2022 in most mainstream anammox processes freshwater anammox bacteria fab were the main functional microorganisms however the activity of fab was inhibited at 3 salinity and even impaired at 30 salinity gonzalez silva et al 2017 liu et al 2009 by contrast as a unique branch of anammox bacteria marine anammox bacteria mab played an important role in the marine nitrogen cycle schmid et al 2007 as halophilic bacteria mab could maintain good microbial activity at 5 35 salinity awata et al 2015 even exhibited high nitrogen removal efficiency at 50 salinity wei et al 2016 moreover mab exhibited good nitrogen removal performance at 15 25 c li et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 which was lower than that of fab 30 37 c kouba et al 2022 as a result halophilic mab has natural advantages in treating saline mariculture wastewater enr otc and smx belong to quinolone tetracycline and sulfonamide antibiotics respectively which have been widely used to treat fish infections and diseases choi et al 2020 gonzález gaya et al 2022 hoa et al 2011 the activity of enzymes in anammoxosome could be inhibited by residual antibiotics in saline maricuture wastewater which led to the deterioration of anammox performance madeira and de araújo 2021 with regard to single antibiotic previous study reported the activity of fab was severely inhibited by 1 mg l 1 tetracycline which caused a significant decrease in fab abundance meng et al 2019 besides ma et al 2021 indicated that the nitrogen removal performance of fab based reactor was significantly deteriorated under 2 mg l 1 smx stress the response of args could be an important means for microorganisms to resist antibiotic stress jing et al 2020 however mariculture wastewater is often a complex environment in which various antibiotics coexist with regard to the combined effects of antibiotics the carbon and nitrogen removal was significantly inhibited by 5 mg l 1 tetracycline and 1 mg l 1 smx in an anoxic aerobic system du et al 2019 in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor the combined effects of erythromycin tetracycline and smx was more toxic than that of single antibiotic to syntrophic bacteria aydin et al 2015 in addition previous study reported the activity of fab was inhibited by high concentration spiramycin and streptomycin and the abundance of fab decreased significantly under combined antibiotic stress lu et al 2021b however the performance and resistance mechanisms of mab under multi antibiotics stress are still unclear in saline mariculture wastewater treatment hence the dynamic changes and resistance mechanisms of mab based microbiome were first investigated under high salinity 35 salinity and multi antibiotic stress in this work the performance and tolerance of halophilic mab based process were studied in treating saline mariculture wastewater containing 3 common antibiotics enr otc smx eos besides the variation of microbial community structure under eos stress was elucidated and the correlations between microbial community and args were revealed still the resistance mechanisms of mab based microbiome were uncovered from extracellular polymeric substances eps and args aspects under different doses of eos this work deciphered the resistance mechanisms of mab based microbiome under eos stress and provided a promising way to treat saline mariculture wastewater containing multi antibiotics 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor and operation the sequencing batch reactor sbr used in this work was made of polymethyl methacrylate with an effective working volume of 7 0 l the reactor was covered with aluminum film and black cloth to avoid the degradation of antibiotics and restrain growth of phototrophic microorganisms the reactor operated 3 cycles per day each operating cycle of sbr included influent feeding 0 15 h anoxic stirring 4 h and effluent discharging 0 15 h the reactor was operated at 25 2 c by the water bath in outer layer and the stirring speed was set at 100 rpm influent was purged with n2 99 to remove oxygen 2 2 synthetic mariculture wastewater characteristics seawater with 35 salinity taken from jiaozhou bay of qingdao city 36 12 n 120 15 e was used to configure synthetic mariculture wastewater influent ph was kept at 7 5 0 1 by injecting 1 mol l 1 hcl or naoh solutions the mineral medium and trace element solutions were added according to previous study li et al 2020 nitrogen substrates ammonium nh4 n and nitrite no2 n were provided by nh4cl and nano2 respectively influent nh4 n and no2 n were 120 and 158 mg l 1 determined by the theoretical stoichiometric ratio nh4 n no2 n no3 n 1 1 32 0 26 strous et al 1999 the sbr was inoculated with settled granular sludge from another lab scale anammox reactor fed with saline wastewater yin et al 2021 the reactor had been operated stably for around 6 months the doses gradients of eos eos dose represents the doses of each antibiotic separately are listed in table s1 2 3 analytical methods the influent and effluent sample 10 ml of the reactor were routinely collected centrifuged 6000 rpm 30 min and filtered 10 15 μm for each cycle nh4 n no2 n no3 n and ph were detected according to the standard methods apha 2005 eps were extracted at the end of each phase based on the heat extraction method yin et al 2015 eps were mainly composed of polysaccharides ps and protein pn which were determined according to previous reports dubois et al 1956 lowry et al 1951 2 4 high throughput sequencing and data analysis four biomass samples s1 s2 s3 and s4 were collected from the reactor on cycle 30 120 210 and 306 corresponding to the eos doses of 0 1 8 and 24 mg l 1 respectively total dna was extracted by using power soil dna isolation kit v3 v4 regions of 16s rrna genes were amplified with ordinary primers detailed in supplementary material the primers and detailed procedures were consistent with previous study si et al 2021 details of a redundancy analysis rda principal component

quantitation of genes were provided in supplementary material each sample was carried out in triplicate network analysis was performed to reveal the correlations between bacterial genera top 20 and args and uncovered the potential hosts of args under multi antibiotic stress details in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance under multi antibiotic and salt stress the nitrogen removal performance of halophilic mab based process under multi antibiotic stress was presented in fig 1 the total nitrogen loading rate of the reactor was maintained at 1 75 0 04 kg m 3 d 1 during the whole operation the total nitrogen removal rate tnrr and total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre were 1 46 0 04 kg m 3 d 1 and 83 06 1 15 without eos stress at 0 2 2 mg l 1 eos the average tnrr and tnre of the mab based process were 1 37 0 06 kg m 3 d 1 and 80 44 3 13 ammonium and nitrite removal efficiency are and nire slightly decreased and then increased and are finally restored to 100 through an acclimatization period besides the stoichiometric ratios were relatively stable and δph was maintained at 0 47 during this period in contrast previous study reported that the nitrogen removal performance of fab consortia fluctuated slightly under 0 1 mg l 1 otc and smx stress but deteriorated under 1 mg l 1 otc and smx zhang et al 2019b moreover the tnre of the fab based process decreased from 92 0 to 50 3 at 2 0 mg l 1 otc within 20 d shi et al 2017 however eos dose within 2 mg l 1 had no obvious inhibition on the mab based process suggesting a better tolerance to multi antibiotics than fab during cycle 150 to 201 nitrogen removal performance was not further inhibited as the eos dose increased mab based process exhibited resistance to multi antibiotics and the tnrr remained stable at 1 29 0 05 kg m 3 d 1 thus mab based process gradually acquired antibiotic resistance to some extent under long term eos pressure similarly fan et al 2020 observed that after a 42 day acclimation the increase of smx or tc concentration had little effect on nitrogen removal performance of denitrification process the antibiotic addition with elevating concentration strategy was conducive to enhance the resistance of the anammox process jing et al 2020 which was consistent with our results during the resistance period the protection mechanisms of mab such as the args response and eps protection further discussed in section 3 3 and 3 5 played a vital role in maintaining a relatively stable tnrr however the deterioration of the reactor was observed at the later stage of the 8 mg l 1 eos and the tnre dropped significantly from 70 7 to 54 14 during cycle 200 to 240 when eos doses increased from 12 to 18 mg l 1 tnrr declined dramatically from 1 05 0 06 to 0 84 0 10 kg m 3 d 1 respectively fig 1b besides no recovery was observed during the whole phase which indicated that overdose multi antibiotics caused irreversible impacts on nitrogen removal of the mab based process due to the different antibacterial mechanisms among antibiotics the tolerance of the anammox process to various antibiotics is significantly different in the long term operation a similar deterioration was also observed in a fab reactor under 2 mg l 1 otc stress zhang et al 2018a while tnrr inhibition of anammox exceeded 50 when smx concentration reached 8 mg l 1 fan et al 2021 in fact the combined toxicity of otc and smx was higher than single toxicity zhang et al 2019b thus mab based process had a better tolerance to combined antibiotics with the further increase in multi antibiotic concentration the reactor almost crashed under 24 mg l 1 eos stress the mean tnrr drastically declined to 0 50 0 09 kg m 3 d 1 which was only 34 24 of initial tnrr the δph value decreased with the increasing eos doses which indicated the metabolic disorders of anammox process si et al 2021 in addition the stoichiometric ratio significantly deviated from the theoretical value suggesting that anammox was severely affected by high concentration eos similarly drastic fluctuations in the stoichiometric ratio were observed when anammox was severely inhibited by 5 mg l 1 spiramycin zhang et al 2021a thus high concentration eos 8 mg l 1 in saline mariculture wastewater had severe inhibition on the mab based process 3 2 variation of microbial community under multi antibiotic and salt stress the microbial community of mab based microbiome was analyzed to evaluate the effects of eos on microorganisms in saline environment the top 20 genera and their corresponding phylum were depicted in fig 2 a pca and pcoa indicated that s1 and s2 had a close distance while s3 and s4 deviated significantly from s1 fig s1 thus the microbial community composition maintained stable within 1 mg l 1 eos but changed significantly as the eos dose further increased at the phylum level proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes chloroflexi and actinobacteria were dominant during the whole operation the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased from initial 42 22 to final 58 72 fig s2 anammox bacteria belonged to planctomycetes whose relative abundance gradually declined from initial 24 92 to final 7 09 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes was 11 36 1 44 throughout the experiment the relative abundance of chloroflexi increased and reached the maximum 19 36 at 8 mg l 1 eos and then declined with increasing eos doses chloroflexi could promote sludge granulation and biofilm structure stability si et al 2021 the relative abundance of actinobacteria increased from 6 07 to 12 08 meng et al 2019 also observed that the abundance of chloroflexi and actinobacteria increased under tetracycline stress at the genus level the rda was conducted to reveal the correlations between the eos and microbial community genus level in four samples fig 2b the relative abundance of rheinheimera and iheb3 7 were positively correlated to the eos suggesting that multi antibiotics had selectivity on these potential antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs by contrast candidatus scalindua mab gammaproteobacteria incertae sedis and gammaproteobacteria showed strong negative relationships with eos indicating that these bacteria were sensitive to multi antibiotics the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria incertae sedis and gammaproteobacteria were 20 47 and 8 04 in s1 and constantly reduced to 4 38 and 1 90 in s4 respectively fig 2a indicating that they were susceptible to multi antibiotics moreover unclassified gammaproteobacteria incertae sedis and gammaproteobacteria were also detected in mab based consortia hu et al 2022 they belonged to class gammaproteobacteria and some of the members were identified as salt tolerant denitrifying bacteria kotcharoen et al 2021 liu et al 2020 the stoichiometric ratios of the mab based consortia were close to the theoretical value without eos addition strous et al 1999 suggesting that denitrification contributed to limited nitrogen removal in the reactor candidatus scalindua was the predominate functional bacteria for nitrogen removal which was further supported by the stoichiometric ratio of anammox presented in fig 1c strous et al 1999 the relative abundance of candidatus scalindua decreased slightly from initial 17 39 to 11 20 at 1 mg l 1 eos fig 2a indicating that mab based consortia maintained relatively high mab abundance under low concentration eos stress correspondingly nitrogen removal performance remained relatively stable during this period by contrast the relative abundance of candidatus jettenia decreased dramatically from initial 12 13 to 1 43 at 1 mg l 1 tetracycline meng et al 2019 which was much lower than that of mab however when eos doses further increased to 8 and 24 mg l 1 the relative abundance of candidatus scalindua dramatically dropped to 4 24 and 2 23 respectively therefore the significant decrease in mab abundance led to the deterioration of tnrr in contrast the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia decreased from 2 57 to only 0 39 when sulfadimethoxine concentration increased from 3 mg l 1 to 7 mg l 1 du et al 2018 in general high concentration eos resulted in the decreased of mab abundance but mab based microbiome could maintain a relatively high mab abundance within 8 mg l 1 rheinheimera was almost undetectable in s1 and accounted for 0 80 in s2 but its proportion increased dramatically to 14 79 and 38 40 when eos doses reached 8 mg l 1 and 24 mg l 1 fig 2b rheinheimera exhibited good tolerance to multi antibiotics and high salinity which had become the dominant bacteria from 8 mg l 1 eos rheinheimera played a vital role in the biogeochemical cycling of the marine environment which could degrade and assimilate marine organic matter liu et al 2012 besides species of rheinheimera were known as multi antibiotic resistant bacteria which have been verified to carry various args fu et al 2020a therefore rheinheimera was a potential arb and accumulated rapidly under high concentration eos which was further supported by rda presented in fig 2b under high antibiotic pressure the occurrence of dead cells and increased eps content contributed to the increase of soluble microbial products zhang et al 2021b which provided electron donors for these heterotrophic bacteria 3 3 response of key genes under multi antibiotic stress as presented in fig 3 a the average relative abundances of total args in four samples were 4 05 10 2 4 04 10 2 7 39 10 2 and 2 44 10 1 copies 16s rrna respectively the seawater might contain trace amounts of antibiotics and args han et al 2020 which resulted in low levels of args detected in s1 without eos addition inti1 was responsible for the transmission of args in the microbial community via hgt fan et al 2021 the relative abundance of inti1 was down regulated slightly in s2 fig 3b while the minimum value of the total args abundance was also observed with the increase of eos doses in s3 and s4 the relative abundance of total args sharply increased by 0 9 and 5 2 folds respectively meanwhile the relative abundance of inti1 showed an increasing trend and reached the maximum in s4 sulfonamide resistance genes occupied a dominant position within 8 mg l 1 eos whose proportion accounted for 73 60 72 09 73 78 and 42 82 of the total args in the four samples respectively fig 3a it indicated that smx had the strongest selective pressure on the args abundance among the three antibiotics as shown in fig 4 both sul1 and sul2 genes were positively correlated to inti1 r 0 94 and 0 93 the highly positive correlation between sul1 and inti1 has been confirmed by previous studies fan et al 2021 harnisz et al 2020 and sul2 was normally located on transmissible multi resistant plasmids gao et al 2012 thus hgt could promote the spread of sulfonamide resistance genes besides args could be selected indirectly by non homologous antibiotics when two or more genes were located in the same mobile genetics elements zhao et al 2019 in this work sul1 qnrb sul2 aac 6 ib cr sul2 qepa sul2 tetg and sul2 tetg showed positive correlations among them sul1 sul2 and tetg have been proved to be carried by the same genome martins et al 2017 consequently sulfonamide resistance genes could be induced by non homologous antibiotics smx and enr the proportion of quinolone resistance genes was stable at 25 33 2 17 in the first three samples and then decreased to 9 68 in s4 fig 3a the abundance of aac 6 ib cr and qepa up regulated in response to antibiotic stress furthermore qepa was efflux pump gene whose abundance was the highest of quinolone resistance genes as presented in fig 4 both aac 6 ib cr and qepa showed positive relationships with inti1 r 0 91 and 0 82 and aac 6 ib cr has been confirmed to be physically located in inti1 harnisz et al 2020 thus hgt seems to occur during the increase of args by contrast qnra and qnrb coding protective protein qnr of topoisomerases laurent et al 2012 were negatively correlated to the eos doses thus qnr protect had limited effects in relieving enr stress while the efflux pump was the major resistance mechanism the proportion of tetracycline resistance genes accounted for a fraction of the total args 1 99 0 83 within 8 mg l 1 eos however tetracycline resistance genes replaced sulfonamide resistance genes as the dominant position at 24 mg l 1 eos whose proportion was sharply to 47 50 fig 3a similarly bai et al 2019 reported tetracycline resistance genes were dominant in total args when anaerobic digested sludge was under the stress of high concentration sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics the batch experiment indicated that high concentration otc had a stronger inhibition on mab than enr or smx fig s3 which stimulated the significant up regulation of tetracycline resistance genes the relative abundances of tetracycline resistance genes were in the order as follows tetx tetg tetm tetc tetx and tetg were positively correlated to inti1 r 0 97 and 0 87 which was consistent with previous study wang et al 2020 thus hgt led to the higher relative abundance of tetx and tetg tetx was responsible for the enzymatic modification mechanism tetc and tetg were efflux pump genes of otc whose relative abundance were 2 10 2 and 1 7 103 times as the initial value at 24 mg l 1 eos it indicated that enzymatic inactivation and efflux pump were main mechanisms of mab based microbiome in resisting otc stress as presented in fig 3d the relative abundance of hdh was up regulated by 4 85 folds at 1 mg l 1 eos thus the mab based microbiome maintained a stable tnrr when mab abundance decreased under low concentration eos stress however the abundance of hdh was significantly down regulated from initial 1 86 10 5 copies 16s rrna to 3 51 10 6 and 1 08 10 5 copies 16s rrna at 8 and 24 mg l 1 eos respectively zhang et al 2019b also indicted that the abundance of hdh gene first increased and then decreased with the increase of antibiotic concentration besides the hdh showed a contrary tendency from dominant args which was negatively correlated with 9 args fig 4 therefore the increase of hdh was a self regulation strategy in response to low concentration eos 3 4 correlations between microbial community and args as presented in fig 5 network analysis suggested that rheinheimera was positively correlated with aac 6 ib cr tetg and tetx r 0 861 0 928 and showed significant positive correlations with qepa sul1 and sul2 r 0 965 0 998 previous study has reported that rheinheimera belonged to multi antibiotic resistant bacteria which was related to multiple efflux pump genes of antibiotics fu et al 2020a zixibacteria had significant positive correlations with 5 args aac 6 ib cr sul1 sul2 tetg and tetx r 0 950 0 993 while iheb3 7 exhibited significant positive correlations with sul2 and qepa r 0 969 and 0 998 zhou et al 2021 suggested that zixibacteria was positively correlated with quinolone and tetracycline resistance genes e g aac 6 ib cr and tetg which was consistent with our results in addition actinomarinales and muricauda were also positively correlated with aac 6 ib cr tetg and tetx r 0 796 0 888 r 0 767 0 777 which were considered to be multi antibiotic resistant bacteria the co occurrences between muricauda and tetracycline and multi antibiotic resistance genes had been reported by zhang et al 2020 these bacteria carried multiple args and were potential arbs in the reactor the transfer of resistance genes resulted in multi antibiotic resistance under high antibiotic pressure summers 2006 these bacteria were positively correlated to inti1 suggesting that inti1 could accelerate the horizontal transfer of args among bacteria schmitz et al 2020 however the nonresistant community e g candidatus scalindua was at a disadvantage in the competition with potential antibiotic resistant community resulting in poor nitrogen removal performance several co occurrences between potential arbs and args have been reported by previous studies such as ⅰ multi antibiotic resistant bacteria rheinheimera was related to multiple efflux pump genes of antibiotics fu et al 2020a ⅱ zhou et al 2021 ⅲ ⅳ rhodobacteraceae was correlated with qnr genes of quinolone wang et al 2019 as args carrying bacteria predominated under high concentration eos stress vgt could be the main driver for args spread and co occurrence of various args li et al 2015 rheinheimera which was strongly correlated with 6 args could carry multiple conjugative elements that are inducible for co resistance to multi antibiotics fu et al 2020b presta et al 2017 vgt promoted the proliferation of arbs to a certain extent li et al 2019 thus the args carried by rheinheimera were related under multi antibiotic stress in addition the synergistic cooperation of different args was helpful to alleviate the antibiotic stress and the same resistance mechanism of args contributed to the co occurrence associations ju et al 2016 for instance efflux pump genes qepa and tetg were found to co occur frequently in potential arb hgt and vgt are two essential routes of args transfer which accelerated the distribution of args and contributed to the co occurrence of args and potential arbs moreover biological techniques were needed to further identify the arbs 3 5 eps protection under different eos doses eps is a protective barrier around bacteria that isolates the hazardous environment and keeps a relatively stable internal environment zhang et al 2019a the regulation of eps secretion is a protective mechanism for mab to resist adverse environment si et al 2021 as presented in fig 6 the eps content of mab based microbiome was stable at 50 23 6 72 mg g vss without multi antibiotics stress after the addition of multi antibiotics the eps content gradually increased and reached the maximum value 153 03 mg g 1 vss at 8 mg l 1 eos ps was proportional to the water content of eps and excessive ps was not conducive to the aggregation and sedimentation of sludge du et al 2019 notably pn occupied the majority of eps after the addition of eos which was consistent with zhang et al 2021a fu et al 2022 reported that pn could be combined with tc smx through hydrogen bonds as a result pn provided adsorption binding sites via hydrophobic regions and functional groups hou et al 2016 which was the dominant defense mechanism of eps to resist eos stress the pn ps value reached the maximum 11 80 at 1 mg l 1 eos suggesting that eps provided more adsorption sites to relieve antibiotic stress thus eps delayed the spread of multi antibiotics into the cells which contributed to the stability of total args abundance at 1 mg l 1 eos the secretion of eps was stimulated to alleviate inhibition of mab based microbiome resulting from low concentration eos however eps content decreased when eos dose exceeded 8 mg l 1 high levels of antibiotics had strong toxic effects on microorganisms yi et al 2017 resulting in the inhibition of eps secretion besides the significant decrease in pn content led to the rapid accumulation of args pn ps value was lower than the initial level when the eos dose exceeded 8 mg l 1 pn ps value reflected settling property and adsorption capacity of granular sludge zhang et al 2019b which caused the poor flocculation ability of the mab sludge at high concentration eos high antibiotic pressure led to several microbial death resulting in the release of eps from cells zhang et al 2018b thus eps content increased slightly at 18 and 24 mg l 1 eos the damage of the eps protection system resulted in the decline of the abundance of mab and concomitant poor nitrogen removal performance similarly fan et al 2021 reported that the eps secretion of fab was stimulated in response to antibiotic stress while args abundance decreased slightly in mab based microbiome the main resistance mechanism shifted from eps protection to args up regulation when antibiotics diffused into the microbes 4 conclusions the performance and response of halophilic mab based microbiome was first investigated in treating saline mariculture wastewater containing multi antibiotics this work uncovered the resistance mechanisms of the mab based microbiome to multi antibiotics and provided a promising anammox microbiome to remove nitrogen in saline mariculture wastewater containing multi antibiotics the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 mab based microbiome had good tolerance to eos within 4 mg l 1 during which the mean are was higher than 90 the tnrr of mab based microbiome was deteriorated at 8 mg l 1 eos and was further inhibited by 65 76 at 24 mg l 1 eos 2 the microbial community structure of mab based microbiome was relatively stable within 1 mg l 1 eos stress but changed significantly under high concentration 8 mg l 1 eos stress the relative abundance of candidatus scalindua decreased significantly at 8 mg l 1 eos and some potential arbs such as rheinheimera were dominated under high concentration eos 3 the resistance mechanisms of the mab based microbiome relied on external eps protection and internal args accumulation the secretion of eps could prevent multi antibiotics from entering cells and weaken the induction of args under low concentration eos stress at high eos doses 8 mg l 1 the significant up regulation of args relieved the stress of the mab based microbiome declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15496,saline mariculture wastewater containing multi antibiotics poses a challenge to anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox process herein the halophilic marine anammox bacteria mab based microbiome was used for treating mariculture wastewater 35 salinity under multi antibiotics enrofloxacin oxytetracycline sulfamethoxazole eos stress and the main focus of this study lies in the response of mab based microbiome against multi antibiotics stress it is found that mab based microbiome shows stable community structure and contributes high nitrogen removal efficiency 90 even under high stress of eos up to 4 mg l 1 the relative abundance of main functional genus candidatus scalindua responsible for anammox had little change while controlling the influent eos concentration within 4 mg l 1 whereas significantly decreased to 2 23 at eos concentration of as high as 24 mg l 1 as an alternative antibiotic resistance bacteria arb species rheinheimera dominated the microbial community of mab based biological reactor under extremely high eos stress e g 24 mg l 1 in influent the response mechanism of mab based microbiome consists of extracellular and intracellular defenses with dependence of eos concentration for example while eos within 4 mg l 1 in this study most of the antibiotics were retained by extracellular polymeric substances eps via adsorption if increasing the eos concentration to 8 and even 24 mg l 1 part of antibiotics could intrude into the cells and cause the intracellular accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes args total abundance up to 2 44 10 1 copies 16s rrna for eos response these new understandings will facilitate the practical implementation of mab based bioprocess for saline nitrogen and antibiotics laden wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords marine anammox bacteria mariculture wastewater antibiotics saline nitrogen removal 1 introduction with the fast development of the mariculture and seafood processing industry the massive emission of saline mariculture wastewater threatened the marine ecosystem and human health huang et al 2021 in addition to nitrogen compounds and organic carbon mariculture wastewater contained high levels of salts and multiple antibiotics lu et al 2021a unlike other industrial wastewater mariculture wastewater usually has low organic matter concentration and these organic carbon in wastewater can be easily removed by microbial degradation wu et al 2022 however high salinity in mariculture wastewater could increase cell osmotic pressure resulting in cell plasmolysis and death li et al 2018 in addition only 20 30 of antibiotics added in mariculture systems were absorbed by organisms li et al 2017 leading to large amounts of residual antibiotics were detected in mariculture wastewater álvarez muñoz et al 2015 serra compte et al 2019 in saline mariculture wastewater the maximum value of oxytetracycline otc concentration even reached 9 46 mg l 1 in jeju island south korea and 15 13 mg l 1 in hailing island china respectively wang et al 2022 due to the discharge of mariculture wastewater high concentration mg l 1 level of enrofloxacin enr otc and sulfamethoxazole smx were frequently detected in the seawater and submarine sediment han et al 2021 microorganisms would be suppressed or even killed under antibiotic stress fan et al 2021 the residue of antibiotics accelerated the spread and enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes args by horizontal and vertical gene transfer hgt and vgt yan et al 2019 therefore an antibiotic resistance and salt tolerance nitrogen removal bioprocess should be developed to treat mariculture wastewater anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is an efficient and economical autotrophic nitrogen removal process which has been applied in sewage treatment plants li et al 2022 coupling processes such as denitrification or nitrification were needed to removal carbon and supply no2 n for anammox lackner et al 2014 wu et al 2022 however because anammox bacteria have long double time sequencing batch reactor sbr can benefit them to grow and resist to detrimental surroundings zhang et al 2022 in most mainstream anammox processes freshwater anammox bacteria fab were the main functional microorganisms however the activity of fab was inhibited at 3 salinity and even impaired at 30 salinity gonzalez silva et al 2017 liu et al 2009 by contrast as a unique branch of anammox bacteria marine anammox bacteria mab played an important role in the marine nitrogen cycle schmid et al 2007 as halophilic bacteria mab could maintain good microbial activity at 5 35 salinity awata et al 2015 even exhibited high nitrogen removal efficiency at 50 salinity wei et al 2016 moreover mab exhibited good nitrogen removal performance at 15 25 c li et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 which was lower than that of fab 30 37 c kouba et al 2022 as a result halophilic mab has natural advantages in treating saline mariculture wastewater enr otc and smx belong to quinolone tetracycline and sulfonamide antibiotics respectively which have been widely used to treat fish infections and diseases choi et al 2020 gonzález gaya et al 2022 hoa et al 2011 the activity of enzymes in anammoxosome could be inhibited by residual antibiotics in saline maricuture wastewater which led to the deterioration of anammox performance madeira and de araújo 2021 with regard to single antibiotic previous study reported the activity of fab was severely inhibited by 1 mg l 1 tetracycline which caused a significant decrease in fab abundance meng et al 2019 besides ma et al 2021 indicated that the nitrogen removal performance of fab based reactor was significantly deteriorated under 2 mg l 1 smx stress the response of args could be an important means for microorganisms to resist antibiotic stress jing et al 2020 however mariculture wastewater is often a complex environment in which various antibiotics coexist with regard to the combined effects of antibiotics the carbon and nitrogen removal was significantly inhibited by 5 mg l 1 tetracycline and 1 mg l 1 smx in an anoxic aerobic system du et al 2019 in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor the combined effects of erythromycin tetracycline and smx was more toxic than that of single antibiotic to syntrophic bacteria aydin et al 2015 in addition previous study reported the activity of fab was inhibited by high concentration spiramycin and streptomycin and the abundance of fab decreased significantly under combined antibiotic stress lu et al 2021b however the performance and resistance mechanisms of mab under multi antibiotics stress are still unclear in saline mariculture wastewater treatment hence the dynamic changes and resistance mechanisms of mab based microbiome were first investigated under high salinity 35 salinity and multi antibiotic stress in this work the performance and tolerance of halophilic mab based process were studied in treating saline mariculture wastewater containing 3 common antibiotics enr otc smx eos besides the variation of microbial community structure under eos stress was elucidated and the correlations between microbial community and args were revealed still the resistance mechanisms of mab based microbiome were uncovered from extracellular polymeric substances eps and args aspects under different doses of eos this work deciphered the resistance mechanisms of mab based microbiome under eos stress and provided a promising way to treat saline mariculture wastewater containing multi antibiotics 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor and operation the sequencing batch reactor sbr used in this work was made of polymethyl methacrylate with an effective working volume of 7 0 l the reactor was covered with aluminum film and black cloth to avoid the degradation of antibiotics and restrain growth of phototrophic microorganisms the reactor operated 3 cycles per day each operating cycle of sbr included influent feeding 0 15 h anoxic stirring 4 h and effluent discharging 0 15 h the reactor was operated at 25 2 c by the water bath in outer layer and the stirring speed was set at 100 rpm influent was purged with n2 99 to remove oxygen 2 2 synthetic mariculture wastewater characteristics seawater with 35 salinity taken from jiaozhou bay of qingdao city 36 12 n 120 15 e was used to configure synthetic mariculture wastewater influent ph was kept at 7 5 0 1 by injecting 1 mol l 1 hcl or naoh solutions the mineral medium and trace element solutions were added according to previous study li et al 2020 nitrogen substrates ammonium nh4 n and nitrite no2 n were provided by nh4cl and nano2 respectively influent nh4 n and no2 n were 120 and 158 mg l 1 determined by the theoretical stoichiometric ratio nh4 n no2 n no3 n 1 1 32 0 26 strous et al 1999 the sbr was inoculated with settled granular sludge from another lab scale anammox reactor fed with saline wastewater yin et al 2021 the reactor had been operated stably for around 6 months the doses gradients of eos eos dose represents the doses of each antibiotic separately are listed in table s1 2 3 analytical methods the influent and effluent sample 10 ml of the reactor were routinely collected centrifuged 6000 rpm 30 min and filtered 10 15 μm for each cycle nh4 n no2 n no3 n and ph were detected according to the standard methods apha 2005 eps were extracted at the end of each phase based on the heat extraction method yin et al 2015 eps were mainly composed of polysaccharides ps and protein pn which were determined according to previous reports dubois et al 1956 lowry et al 1951 2 4 high throughput sequencing and data analysis four biomass samples s1 s2 s3 and s4 were collected from the reactor on cycle 30 120 210 and 306 corresponding to the eos doses of 0 1 8 and 24 mg l 1 respectively total dna was extracted by using power soil dna isolation kit v3 v4 regions of 16s rrna genes were amplified

quantitation of genes were provided in supplementary material each sample was carried out in triplicate network analysis was performed to reveal the correlations between bacterial genera top 20 and args and uncovered the potential hosts of args under multi antibiotic stress details in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance under multi antibiotic and salt stress the nitrogen removal performance of halophilic mab based process under multi antibiotic stress was presented in fig 1 the total nitrogen loading rate of the reactor was maintained at 1 75 0 04 kg m 3 d 1 during the whole operation the total nitrogen removal rate tnrr and total nitrogen removal efficiency tnre were 1 46 0 04 kg m 3 d 1 and 83 06 1 15 without eos stress at 0 2 2 mg l 1 eos the average tnrr and tnre of the mab based process were 1 37 0 06 kg m 3 d 1 and 80 44 3 13 ammonium and nitrite removal efficiency are and nire slightly decreased and then increased and are finally restored to 100 through an acclimatization period besides the stoichiometric ratios were relatively stable and δph was maintained at 0 47 during this period in contrast previous study reported that the nitrogen removal performance of fab consortia fluctuated slightly under 0 1 mg l 1 otc and smx stress but deteriorated under 1 mg l 1 otc and smx zhang et al 2019b moreover the tnre of the fab based process decreased from 92 0 to 50 3 at 2 0 mg l 1 otc within 20 d shi et al 2017 however eos dose within 2 mg l 1 had no obvious inhibition on the mab based process suggesting a better tolerance to multi antibiotics than fab during cycle 150 to 201 nitrogen removal performance was not further inhibited as the eos dose increased mab based process exhibited resistance to multi antibiotics and the tnrr remained stable at 1 29 0 05 kg m 3 d 1 thus mab based process gradually acquired antibiotic resistance to some extent under long term eos pressure similarly fan et al 2020 observed that after a 42 day acclimation the increase of smx or tc concentration had little effect on nitrogen removal performance of denitrification process the antibiotic addition with elevating concentration strategy was conducive to enhance the resistance of the anammox process jing et al 2020 which was consistent with our results during the resistance period the protection mechanisms of mab such as the args response and eps protection further discussed in section 3 3 and 3 5 played a vital role in maintaining a relatively stable tnrr however the deterioration of the reactor was observed at the later stage of the 8 mg l 1 eos and the tnre dropped significantly from 70 7 to 54 14 during cycle 200 to 240 when eos doses increased from 12 to 18 mg l 1 tnrr declined dramatically from 1 05 0 06 to 0 84 0 10 kg m 3 d 1 respectively fig 1b besides no recovery was observed during the whole phase which indicated that overdose multi antibiotics caused irreversible impacts on nitrogen removal of the mab based process due to the different antibacterial mechanisms among antibiotics the tolerance of the anammox process to various antibiotics is significantly different in the long term operation a similar deterioration was also observed in a fab reactor under 2 mg l 1 otc stress zhang et al 2018a while tnrr inhibition of anammox exceeded 50 when smx concentration reached 8 mg l 1 fan et al 2021 in fact the combined toxicity of otc and smx was higher than single toxicity zhang et al 2019b thus mab based process had a better tolerance to combined antibiotics with the further increase in multi antibiotic concentration the reactor almost crashed under 24 mg l 1 eos stress the mean tnrr drastically declined to 0 50 0 09 kg m 3 d 1 which was only 34 24 of initial tnrr the δph value decreased with the increasing eos doses which indicated the metabolic disorders of anammox process si et al 2021 in addition the stoichiometric ratio significantly deviated from the theoretical value suggesting that anammox was severely affected by high concentration eos similarly drastic fluctuations in the stoichiometric ratio were observed when anammox was severely inhibited by 5 mg l 1 spiramycin zhang et al 2021a thus high concentration eos 8 mg l 1 in saline mariculture wastewater had severe inhibition on the mab based process 3 2 variation of microbial community under multi antibiotic and salt stress the microbial community of mab based microbiome was analyzed to evaluate the effects of eos on microorganisms in saline environment the top 20 genera and their corresponding phylum were depicted in fig 2 a pca and pcoa indicated that s1 and s2 had a close distance while s3 and s4 deviated significantly from s1 fig s1 thus the microbial community composition maintained stable within 1 mg l 1 eos but changed significantly as the eos dose further increased at the phylum level proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes chloroflexi and actinobacteria were dominant during the whole operation the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased from initial 42 22 to final 58 72 fig s2 anammox bacteria belonged to planctomycetes whose relative abundance gradually declined from initial 24 92 to final 7 09 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes was 11 36 1 44 throughout the experiment the relative abundance of chloroflexi increased and reached the maximum 19 36 at 8 mg l 1 eos and then declined with increasing eos doses chloroflexi could promote sludge granulation and biofilm structure stability si et al 2021 the relative abundance of actinobacteria increased from 6 07 to 12 08 meng et al 2019 also observed that the abundance of chloroflexi and actinobacteria increased under tetracycline stress at the genus level the rda was conducted to reveal the correlations between the eos and microbial community genus level in four samples fig 2b the relative abundance of rheinheimera and iheb3 7 were positively correlated to the eos suggesting that multi antibiotics had selectivity on these potential antibiotic resistant bacteria arbs by contrast candidatus scalindua mab gammaproteobacteria incertae sedis and gammaproteobacteria showed strong negative relationships with eos indicating that these bacteria were sensitive to multi antibiotics the relative abundance of gammaproteobacteria incertae sedis and gammaproteobacteria were 20 47 and 8 04 in s1 and constantly reduced to 4 38 and 1 90 in s4 respectively fig 2a indicating that they were susceptible to multi antibiotics moreover unclassified gammaproteobacteria incertae sedis and gammaproteobacteria were also detected in mab based consortia hu et al 2022 they belonged to class gammaproteobacteria and some of the members were identified as salt tolerant denitrifying bacteria kotcharoen et al 2021 liu et al 2020 the stoichiometric ratios of the mab based consortia were close to the theoretical value without eos addition strous et al 1999 suggesting that denitrification contributed to limited nitrogen removal in the reactor candidatus scalindua was the predominate functional bacteria for nitrogen removal which was further supported by the stoichiometric ratio of anammox presented in fig 1c strous et al 1999 the relative abundance of candidatus scalindua decreased slightly from initial 17 39 to 11 20 at 1 mg l 1 eos fig 2a indicating that mab based consortia maintained relatively high mab abundance under low concentration eos stress correspondingly nitrogen removal performance remained relatively stable during this period by contrast the relative abundance of candidatus jettenia decreased dramatically from initial 12 13 to 1 43 at 1 mg l 1 tetracycline meng et al 2019 which was much lower than that of mab however when eos doses further increased to 8 and 24 mg l 1 the relative abundance of candidatus scalindua dramatically dropped to 4 24 and 2 23 respectively therefore the significant decrease in mab abundance led to the deterioration of tnrr in contrast the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia decreased from 2 57 to only 0 39 when sulfadimethoxine concentration increased from 3 mg l 1 to 7 mg l 1 du et al 2018 in general high concentration eos resulted in the decreased of mab abundance but mab based microbiome could maintain a relatively high mab abundance within 8 mg l 1 rheinheimera was almost undetectable in s1 and accounted for 0 80 in s2 but its proportion increased dramatically to 14 79 and 38 40 when eos doses reached 8 mg l 1 and 24 mg l 1 fig 2b rheinheimera exhibited good tolerance to multi antibiotics and high salinity which had become the dominant bacteria from 8 mg l 1 eos rheinheimera played a vital role in the biogeochemical cycling of the marine environment which could degrade and assimilate marine organic matter liu et al 2012 besides species of rheinheimera were known as multi antibiotic resistant bacteria which have been verified to carry various args fu et al 2020a therefore rheinheimera was a potential arb and accumulated rapidly under high concentration eos which was further supported by rda presented in fig 2b under high antibiotic pressure the occurrence of dead cells and increased eps content contributed to the increase of soluble microbial products zhang et al 2021b which provided electron donors for these heterotrophic bacteria 3 3 response of key genes under multi antibiotic stress as presented in fig 3 a the average relative abundances of total args in four samples were 4 05 10 2 4 04 10 2 7 39 10 2 and 2 44 10 1 copies 16s rrna respectively the seawater might contain trace amounts of antibiotics and args han et al 2020 which resulted in low levels of args detected in s1 without eos addition inti1 was responsible for the transmission of args in the microbial community via hgt fan et al 2021 the relative abundance of inti1 was down regulated slightly in s2 fig 3b while the minimum value of the total args abundance was also observed with the increase of eos doses in s3 and s4 the relative abundance of total args sharply increased by 0 9 and 5 2 folds respectively meanwhile the relative abundance of inti1 showed an increasing trend and reached the maximum in s4 sulfonamide resistance genes occupied a dominant position within 8 mg l 1 eos whose proportion accounted for 73 60 72 09 73 78 and 42 82 of the total args in the four samples respectively fig 3a it indicated that smx had the strongest selective pressure on the args abundance among the three antibiotics as shown in fig 4 both sul1 and sul2 genes were positively correlated to inti1 r 0 94 and 0 93 the highly positive correlation between sul1 and inti1 has been confirmed by previous studies fan et al 2021 harnisz et al 2020 and sul2 was normally located on transmissible multi resistant plasmids gao et al 2012 thus hgt could promote the spread of sulfonamide resistance genes besides args could be selected indirectly by non homologous antibiotics when two or more genes were located in the same mobile genetics elements zhao et al 2019 in this work sul1 qnrb sul2 aac 6 ib cr sul2 qepa sul2 tetg and sul2 tetg showed positive correlations among them sul1 sul2 and tetg have been proved to be carried by the same genome martins et al 2017 consequently sulfonamide resistance genes could be induced by non homologous antibiotics smx and enr the proportion of quinolone resistance genes was stable at 25 33 2 17 in the first three samples and then decreased to 9 68 in s4 fig 3a the abundance of aac 6 ib cr and qepa up regulated in response to antibiotic stress furthermore qepa was efflux pump gene whose abundance was the highest of quinolone resistance genes as presented in fig 4 both aac 6 ib cr and qepa showed positive relationships with inti1 r 0 91 and 0 82 and aac 6 ib cr has been confirmed to be physically located in inti1 harnisz et al 2020 thus hgt seems to occur during the increase of args by contrast qnra and qnrb coding protective protein qnr of topoisomerases laurent et al 2012 were negatively correlated to the eos doses thus qnr protect had limited effects in relieving enr stress while the efflux pump was the major resistance mechanism the proportion of tetracycline resistance genes accounted for a fraction of the total args 1 99 0 83 within 8 mg l 1 eos however tetracycline resistance genes replaced sulfonamide resistance genes as the dominant position at 24 mg l 1 eos whose proportion was sharply to 47 50 fig 3a similarly bai et al 2019 reported tetracycline resistance genes were dominant in total args when anaerobic digested sludge was under the stress of high concentration sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics the batch experiment indicated that high concentration otc had a stronger inhibition on mab than enr or smx fig s3 which stimulated the significant up regulation of tetracycline resistance genes the relative abundances of tetracycline resistance genes were in the order as follows tetx tetg tetm tetc tetx and tetg were positively correlated to inti1 r 0 97 and 0 87 which was consistent with previous study wang et al 2020 thus hgt led to the higher relative abundance of tetx and tetg tetx was responsible for the enzymatic modification mechanism tetc and tetg were efflux pump genes of otc whose relative abundance were 2 10 2 and 1 7 103 times as the initial value at 24 mg l 1 eos it indicated that enzymatic inactivation and efflux pump were main mechanisms of mab based microbiome in resisting otc stress as presented in fig 3d the relative abundance of hdh was up regulated by 4 85 folds at 1 mg l 1 eos thus the mab based microbiome maintained a stable tnrr when mab abundance decreased under low concentration eos stress however the abundance of hdh was significantly down regulated from initial 1 86 10 5 copies 16s rrna to 3 51 10 6 and 1 08 10 5 copies 16s rrna at 8 and 24 mg l 1 eos respectively zhang et al 2019b also indicted that the abundance of hdh gene first increased and then decreased with the increase of antibiotic concentration besides the hdh showed a contrary tendency from dominant args which was negatively correlated with 9 args fig 4 therefore the increase of hdh was a self regulation strategy in response to low concentration eos 3 4 correlations between microbial community and args as presented in fig 5 network analysis suggested that rheinheimera was positively correlated with aac 6 ib cr tetg and tetx r 0 861 0 928 and showed significant positive correlations with qepa sul1 and sul2 r 0 965 0 998 previous study has reported that rheinheimera belonged to multi antibiotic resistant bacteria which was related to multiple efflux pump genes of antibiotics fu et al 2020a zixibacteria had significant positive correlations with 5 args aac 6 ib cr sul1 sul2 tetg and tetx r 0 950 0 993 while iheb3 7 exhibited significant positive correlations with sul2 and qepa r 0 969 and 0 998 zhou et al 2021 suggested that zixibacteria was positively correlated with quinolone and tetracycline resistance genes e g aac 6 ib cr and tetg which was consistent with our results in addition actinomarinales and muricauda were also positively correlated with aac 6 ib cr tetg and tetx r 0 796 0 888 r 0 767 0 777 which were considered to be multi antibiotic resistant bacteria the co occurrences between muricauda and tetracycline and multi antibiotic resistance genes had been reported by zhang et al 2020 these bacteria carried multiple args and were potential arbs in the reactor the transfer of resistance genes resulted in multi antibiotic resistance under high antibiotic pressure summers 2006 these bacteria were positively correlated to inti1 suggesting that inti1 could accelerate the horizontal transfer of args among bacteria schmitz et al 2020 however the nonresistant community e g candidatus scalindua was at a disadvantage in the competition with potential antibiotic resistant community resulting in poor nitrogen removal performance several co occurrences between potential arbs and args have been reported by previous studies such as ⅰ multi antibiotic resistant bacteria rheinheimera was related to multiple efflux pump genes of antibiotics fu et al 2020a ⅱ zhou et al 2021 ⅲ ⅳ rhodobacteraceae was correlated with qnr genes of quinolone wang et al 2019 as args carrying bacteria predominated under high concentration eos stress vgt could be the main driver for args spread and co occurrence of various args li et al 2015 rheinheimera which was strongly correlated with 6 args could carry multiple conjugative elements that are inducible for co resistance to multi antibiotics fu et al 2020b presta et al 2017 vgt promoted the proliferation of arbs to a certain extent li et al 2019 thus the args carried by rheinheimera were related under multi antibiotic stress in addition the synergistic cooperation of different args was helpful to alleviate the antibiotic stress and the same resistance mechanism of args contributed to the co occurrence associations ju et al 2016 for instance efflux pump genes qepa and tetg were found to co occur frequently in potential arb hgt and vgt are two essential routes of args transfer which accelerated the distribution of args and contributed to the co occurrence of args and potential arbs moreover biological techniques were needed to further identify the arbs 3 5 eps protection under different eos doses eps is a protective barrier around bacteria that isolates the hazardous environment and keeps a relatively stable internal environment zhang et al 2019a the regulation of eps secretion is a protective mechanism for mab to resist adverse environment si et al 2021 as presented in fig 6 the eps content of mab based microbiome was stable at 50 23 6 72 mg g vss without multi antibiotics stress after the addition of multi antibiotics the eps content gradually increased and reached the maximum value 153 03 mg g 1 vss at 8 mg l 1 eos ps was proportional to the water content of eps and excessive ps was not conducive to the aggregation and sedimentation of sludge du et al 2019 notably pn occupied the majority of eps after the addition of eos which was consistent with zhang et al 2021a fu et al 2022 reported that pn could be combined with tc smx through hydrogen bonds as a result pn provided adsorption binding sites via hydrophobic regions and functional groups hou et al 2016 which was the dominant defense mechanism of eps to resist eos stress the pn ps value reached the maximum 11 80 at 1 mg l 1 eos suggesting that eps provided more adsorption sites to relieve antibiotic stress thus eps delayed the spread of multi antibiotics into the cells which contributed to the stability of total args abundance at 1 mg l 1 eos the secretion of eps was stimulated to alleviate inhibition of mab based microbiome resulting from low concentration eos however eps content decreased when eos dose exceeded 8 mg l 1 high levels of antibiotics had strong toxic effects on microorganisms yi et al 2017 resulting in the inhibition of eps secretion besides the significant decrease in pn content led to the rapid accumulation of args pn ps value was lower than the initial level when the eos dose exceeded 8 mg l 1 pn ps value reflected settling property and adsorption capacity of granular sludge zhang et al 2019b which caused the poor flocculation ability of the mab sludge at high concentration eos high antibiotic pressure led to several microbial death resulting in the release of eps from cells zhang et al 2018b thus eps content increased slightly at 18 and 24 mg l 1 eos the damage of the eps protection system resulted in the decline of the abundance of mab and concomitant poor nitrogen removal performance similarly fan et al 2021 reported that the eps secretion of fab was stimulated in response to antibiotic stress while args abundance decreased slightly in mab based microbiome the main resistance mechanism shifted from eps protection to args up regulation when antibiotics diffused into the microbes 4 conclusions the performance and response of halophilic mab based microbiome was first investigated in treating saline mariculture wastewater containing multi antibiotics this work uncovered the resistance mechanisms of the mab based microbiome to multi antibiotics and provided a promising anammox microbiome to remove nitrogen in saline mariculture wastewater containing multi antibiotics the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 mab based microbiome had good tolerance to eos within 4 mg l 1 during which the mean are was higher than 90 the tnrr of mab based microbiome was deteriorated at 8 mg l 1 eos and was further inhibited by 65 76 at 24 mg l 1 eos 2 the microbial community structure of mab based microbiome was relatively stable within 1 mg l 1 eos stress but changed significantly under high concentration 8 mg l 1 eos stress the relative abundance of candidatus scalindua decreased significantly at 8 mg l 1 eos and some potential arbs such as rheinheimera were dominated under high concentration eos 3 the resistance mechanisms of the mab based microbiome relied on external eps protection and internal args accumulation the secretion of eps could prevent multi antibiotics from entering cells and weaken the induction of args under low concentration eos stress at high eos doses 8 mg l 1 the significant up regulation of args relieved the stress of the mab based microbiome declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15497,deep insights into the receiving waters responses to optimal spatial allocation of lid bmps are considered extremely important this study addressed the urgent need to incorporate receiving waters responses into the spatial allocation optimization of lid bmps and demonstrated the efficiency of the approach to guide watershed management the integration of an overland river coupling model and the nsga iii algorithm resulted in the proposal of a general simulation optimization framework for the optimal layout of lid bmps the coupled model was swapped out for the surrogates to increase computational efficiency when 40 71 36 06 and 61 80 reductions in runoff volume flood volume and tp concentration are achieved the newly proposed framework can save 34 44 and 16 31 cost compared to the approach that does not consider receiving waters responses and refined spatial allocation respectively results indicate that the incorporation of receiving waters responses and refined spatial allocation are essential for the optimal design of lid bmps this new framework offers the potential for more cost effective high cost solutions the results of spatial optimization are significantly influenced by imperviousness graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lid bmps simulation optimization spatial optimization receiving waters responses data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the middle and lower portions of the yangtze river plain in china are highly inhabited and have a vibrant economy excessive runoff induced by rapid urbanization has led to flooding and water quality deterioration in receiving water bodies conley et al 2009 making it difficult to achieve sustainable economic growth in these areas low impact development best management practices lid bmps have recently gained popularity as a means of mitigating urban water problems jia et al 2015 the benefits of lid bmps are strongly localized and exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity jia et al 2022 the refined optimal layout of lid bmps is in great demand in order to maximize a variety of goals such as runoff volume control flood risk mitigation and non point source nps pollution control due to the typical hydrological pattern rainfall runoff is first treated by lid bmps in a plain river network region before being discharged to receiving water bodies through the drainage system the overland area and the river are not separate but should be viewed as a coherent entity leng et al 2020 however previous studies have tended to model overland and river systems separately zhang and chui 2020 an integrated tool is required to effectively reflect the overland and river processes numerous simulation optimization techniques combine optimization algorithms with stormwater management models baek et al 2015 jean et al 2022 tang et al 2021 however research gaps still exist in both incorporating receiving waters responses and refined spatial allocation the responses of receiving water bodies to runoff control and pollutant load abatement have so far only rarely been addressed in spatial optimization of lid bmps which mainly focuses on the optimization of runoff volume control and pollutant loads reduction in the overland area yang and best 2015 zeng et al 2019 the optimal allocation of lid bmps must be guided by the receiving waters responses to spatially heterogeneous runoff and pollution abatement which cannot be represented by an overland optimization technique that ignores pollutant transit and transformation processes in river channels due to the research gap the optimal lid bmp strategies might not achieve the desired water quality target rezazadeh helmi et al 2019 the overland and river objects should be taken into account in an optimization procedure hence a comprehensive optimization approach should be utilized in addition an integrated model that can characterize the relationship between lid bmps and receiving waters responses is also crucial for lid bmps spatial optimization at the same time the majority of earlier studies only concentrated on optimal sizing which is defined by the area percentage of lid bmps showing just the lid bmps density but not the spatial distribution johnson and sample 2017 the performance of lid bmps can vary greatly depending on location jia et al 2022 some research pre determined the priority areas for lid bmps by considering solely topographical factors nevertheless the locations identified may not be the optimal locations as the unpredictability of practices is not taken into account meerow and newell 2017 zhao et al 2018 the refined design of lid bmps requires us to optimize the size and location of lid bmps as a whole it is crucial to develop a strategy to optimize spatial layout of lid bmps considering the receiving waters responses the computationally expensive and technically complex execution of high dimensional models particularly for numerous models runs was seen as problematic in the optimization phase motivated by concerns about computational efficiency researchers have sought innovative approaches to alleviate the tremendous computational demands creating effective surrogate models to replace the complex model is a possible option due to the complexity nonlinearity time lag and instability of the water environment system the long short term memory network lstm model is able to predict water quality time series data over an extended period of time castrillo and garcía 2020 research into linking the efdc model to lstm has been increasing to an extent zou 2013 utilized efdc and lstm to undertake an investigation of the water quality risk liang et al 2020 demonstrated that lstm can imitate the predictive capacity of efdc by using lstm to predict chl a to address the time cost limitation for high dimensional models a rapid response water quality model had to be integrated into the optimization process as a surrogate to fill the above knowledge gaps a general simulation optimization framework for refined lid bmps spatial allocation incorporating receiving waters responses was proposed in this study to our knowledge this was the first attempt to incorporate receiving waters responses into the optimal layout of lid bmps the coupled swmm efdc model was developed to offer indications for evaluating the performance of lid bmps schemes incorporating both overland and river processes a sophisticated efdc simulation system will be replaced with a rapid response water quality model that combines the latin hypercube sampling method with the lstm model the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii was chosen as the engine for multi objective optimization due to its superior performance to identify the most influential catchment characteristics on spatial optimization the relative importance of a predictor was determined the sponge city pilot area pingjiang new city in suzhou was used as a representative case study 2 material and methodology the methodology framework is depicted in fig 1 1 an overland river coupling model for simulating overland and instream processes under the lid bmps scenarios and 2 a spatial optimization module for determining the optimal lid bmps spatial allocation 2 1 study area located in suzhou jiangsu province pingjiang new city was chosen for our case study fig 2 a the total area is 5 5 km2 the annual average air temperature is 16 6 c and the annual average precipitation is about 1163 mm 67 8 of the annual precipitation falls between april and september which corresponds to the flooding season the selection of lid bmps is mainly based on technical guidelines for selection method of sponge city low impact development facilities cecs 2021 cecs standard mainly edited by our research group and the local characteristics of study area bio retention br permeable pavement pp and green roof gr had the highest score and then were adopted structure and cost information of lid bmps can be found in section 3 of the si the study area is a typical example of sponge city s construction and the abundance of basic data enables our case study meanwhile stormwater runoff is discharged directly into rivers via a separate drainage system established in the study area due to the typical plain river network region pattern the chosen area also encompasses a significant portion of china since great progress has been made in recent years to address point source pollution excessive nps load has become a rising hazard to water quality improvement it is expected that the study s outcomes will serve as a basis for future relevant research 2 2 overland river coupling model swmm efdc an integrated overland area and river model was developed toestimate the environmental benefits of each lid bmps configuration the overland section estimates the flow and contaminants delivered into the waterway from each sub catchment the river section replicates the water routing and nutrient transfer throughout the channels network here we present the simplified procedures sections 1 and 2 of the si contains the main parameters setup calibration and validation results 2 2 1 overland area model development we use swmm model to simulate rainfall runoff and pipe flow in overland system the swmm contains of computing modules such as rainfall runoff and pipe flow etc rossman and huber 2016 the rainfall runoff module which is dominated by hydrological computing describes the formation and concentration of runoff in a dynamic manner the pipe flow module replicates the hydromechanical flow routing mechanism in drainage pipe network the swmm model was chosen because it is widely used to evaluate the hydrological and water quality performance of lid bmps using a mature lid module in addition since swmm is a open source software it can be further enhanced and integrated into other applications using custom computer scripts based on land use pipelines and river networks 393 sub catchments were defined within the study area fig 2 b the drainage network was simplified and consisted of 373 junctions 97 outfalls and 373 conduits two types of parameters were used measured parameters and empirical parameters the measured parameters included area slope width impervious percentage conduit length etc the empirical parameters such as infiltration coefficient manning s n value of impervious pervious areas and depression storage of impervious pervious areas need to be adjusted through model calibration and validation three main pollutants were considered in the modeling chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp to fully analyze the design schemes a one year precipitation 2018 year is employed in the model simulation annual precipitation in suzhou in 2018 is close to the average annual precipitation for the past two decades which is representative of precipitation conditions in the study area 2 2 2 river network model development efdc model was used to build a three dimensional water quality model the efdc model can replicate a variety of water systems including rivers lakes estuaries and oceans efdc model mainly includes hydrodynamics module water quality module and sediment transport module etc hamrick 1992 based on the study needs hydrodynamic and water quality modules were used the hydrodynamic module s output can be directly communicated to the water quality module to facilitate the internal movement of contaminants the water quality module of efdc can simulate the reaction kinetics of algae carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silicon a total of 22 state variables are involved fig s1 given that this study focuses on simulating cod nh3 n and tp the water quality module mainly simulates carbon reaction kinetics nitrogen reaction kinetics and phosphorus reaction kinetics efdc is frequently employed to quantify a river s response to external loads and assess the effectiveness of initiatives pyo et al 2021 using the two dimensional orthogonal curvilinear grid tool 409 divided grid cells were generated fig 2 b the average grid dimensions dx were 19 55 meters dy was 23 61 meters and the average orthogonal deviation was 2 79 3 the meteorological boundary is represented by time varying data from local monitoring stations which includes atmospheric pressure air temperature relative humidity precipitation evaporation solar radiation cloud cover etc the inflows consist of water transfer from upstream and rainfall runoff the water level is regulated by gates and pumps the duration of the experiment is from january 1 to december 31 2018 with 10 min steps and daily output 2 2 3 model coupling fig 1 depicts a loosely coupled model linking swmm and efdc the two model structures were left unaltered and were integrated via external file input and output rather than internal function calls the fundamental swmm processing units known as sub catchments are decentralized blocks and cannot be utilized for overland river coupled system management the catchment is used to build land source water sink interactions between the overland river network as a typical hydrological response unit the study area is generalized into 12 catchments from 393 sub catchments fig 2 b the swmm output file s flow and conc contain information on the flow and pollutants concentration at each catchment outfall the output data of swmm can be utilized as the input data of efdc where flow corresponds to qser inp and conc corresponds to dser inp according to the discharge grid of each outfall in the river furthermore efdc is able to simulate river dynamics after obtaining flow and pollutants within the integrated python platform the coupled procedure was automatically configured and executed 2 2 4 long short term memory lstm in this study lstm model was utilized as a surrogate model to accelerate model simulation an lstm layer consists of a set of recurrently connected memory cells to store and pass sequential information each lstm memory cell has three information gates input gate forget gate and output gate fig 3 the forward pass of the lstm model is described by the following greff et al 2017 1 i n p u t t r a n s f o r m a t i o n x t r e l u w i i t b i 2 i n p u t n o d e g t tanh d w g x x t d w g h h t 1 b g 3 i n p u t g a t e i t σ d w i x

the fitness value during the iterative optimization process swmm efdc has to be executed numerous times resulting in a time consuming global search to ease the computational effort a rapid response water quality model was developed by combining a process based model with lstm to quickly capture the primary relationship between lid bmps schemes and water quality response specifically the input data of lstm are the surface runoff and pollutants series under the implementation of lid bmps and the output is the water quality response after inputting the surface runoff and pollutants series into an efdc coupling simulation the flowchart for the rapid response water quality model is depicted in fig 4 following is a detailed description of the procedures step 1 random reduction module the latin hypercube sampling method huntington and lyrintzis 1998 was used to randomly choose the objectives of runoff r and pollutant load reduction p a p b p m within the range 10 90 zhang et al 2021 repetitively with a simulation number n 200 the reduction ratios represent effectiveness of various lid bmps schemes in the whole range of lid bmps placing ratios so that the trained lstm has good generalization ability of lid bmps simulation the runoff q m3 d and pollutant load series l a l b l m g d for the baseline scenario without lid bmps application were created by the swmm model then reduction ratio samples were multiplied by the baseline scenario runoff and pollutants series to represent the surface runoff and pollutants series after the lid bmps implementation q l a l b l m eqs

study the python based open source software pytorch was used to implement the lstm algorithm the lstm model develop procedure consists of the following steps sample sequences construction through the

various elements of the spatial allocation of lid bmps indicated in fig 1 were represented using implementation ratio and location variables the implementation ratio of lid bmps which is the ratio of the total area of lid bmps to the total area of available locations for lid bmps is represented by the φ i φ 1 represents the bio retention implementation ratio in green area φ 2 represents the green roof implementation ratio in roof φ 3 represents the permeable pavement implementation ratio in road area the location variables were described as a chromosome with genes the implementation ratios for each sub catchment including φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 were assigned independently the number of sub catchments multiplied by the number of lid bmp categories equals the total number of decision variables 3 393 1179 an initial population of solutions was produced at random using the real number encoding 2 3 2 optimization objectives the source process terminal system as a whole has its optimization goals established they are 1 maximizing the runoff volume reduction eq 19 2 maximizing the flood volume reduction and eq 20 3 maximizing the pollutants concentration deduction eq 21 the runoff volume represents the portion of the flow that is yielded at the source s surface and discharged through the outfall the flood volume is the portion that exceeds the capacity of the drainage network and thus overflows from the network to measure whether the water response meets surface water quality criteria the degree of improvement of the pollutant concentration in the receiving water body is taken into account the cost of lid bmps was estimated using the life cycle cost model lcc three components of the associated cost should be taken into account from an engineering standpoint capital expenses during the construction stage operation and maintenance costs during the operation stage and the salvage value during the end stage xu et al 2021 the present value of cost in eq 22 was used to

objectives nsga iii was utilized as the optimization algorithm in this work deb and jain 2014 studies have demonstrated that nsga iii is superior to nsga ii in maintaining diversity and achieving convergence when solving optimization problems with up to fifty objectives bhesdadiya et al 2016 for this reason nsga iii was chosen to solve the 6 objective optimization problem nsga iii has been modified relative to the algorithm of the previous generation nsga ii by incorporating a reference point based selection mechanism the nsga iii framework is depicted in fig 1 the population size

requirements are met eqs 19 and 22 were selected as the fitness function for the selection of individuals during the iterative phase of nsga iii individuals who violated the constraints expressed in eqs 25 and 27 were removed 2 3 4 optimization scenarios setting four optimization scenarios were established to validate the global optimality of the simulation optimization methodology suggested table 1 i and ii scenarios are based on the effects of lid bmps on runoff and pollutant emissions from each overland spatial unit but do not account for the transmission of pollutants downstream the efdc model was used again to determine the water quality response of each lid bmps solution after the pareto optimum front was formed in scenario i and ii in scenarios i and iii the same implementation ratio is specified for all sub catchments 2 4 identification of key catchment characteristics influencing on spatial optimization 2 in an effort to identify the key catchment characteristics influencing the spatial optimization results of lid bmps we gathered a list of previously published environmental factors including slope elevation imperviousness land use and distance to river jia et al 2013 the land use variable is represented by the emc values of cod nh3 n and tp which refer to the proportions of land use types we define distance to river as the distance between a sub catchment and the location at which its outflow enters the river channel the inherent diversity of catchment characteristics necessitates the use of diversity models in order to comprehend how catchment factors may impact the lid bmps configuration all subsets regression offers all conceivable variable selection combinations with varying fitting performances this approach provides numerous model selection options wasserman and sudjianto 1994 were utilized in this study for each separate multivariable regression technique all conceivable combinations of significant catchment characteristics were produced and the statistical significance of the covariable coefficients was assessed data analysis was conducted using the glmulti package of r 28 φ i k 1 x 1 k 2 x 2 k 3 x 3 k 4

200 iterations are generated three scenarios with 50 pollutants reduction ratio of cod nh3 n and tp the study area management target were selected as out of sample test sets based on the sliding window method a total of 363 197 71511 training and validation samples were generated from the remaining 197 scenarios 71511 80 57208 training sequences and 71511 80 14302 validation sequences validation samples are used to determine hyperparameters of lstm si table s12 fig 5 compared the lstm and efdc calculation outcomes where the data points in each plot congregate on the left and right sides of the diagonal the training results of the lstm are shown in fig 5 a c and e the testing performance of the lstm is displayed in fig 5 b d and f these developed lstm models are predicted to perform well in terms of fitting and prediction the model has an excellent generalization performance with minimal error according to the three out of sample test results fig 6 peak concentrations of cod nh3 n and tp often occur in the summer june to august and are mainly caused by rainfall events 3 2 comparison among the optimization results the final four dimensional pareto optimal front of the proposed simulation optimization framework was compared to those achieved by other optimization strategies fig 7 the runoff volume reduction flood volume reduction and pollutant concentration decrease are depicted on the x y and z axes respectively the cost is denoted by marker color both i ii and iii scenarios are dominated by the pareto front solutions of iv interestingly the pareto optimal fronts of these four scenarios had comparable costs within the low cost range this could be explained by the fact that cheaper lid bmps were recognized simultaneously by all four scenarios at an early stage of evolution nonetheless obvious vertical distances could be noticed between the four curves in places with higher costs indicating that the suggested framework outperformed previous frameworks in these ranges to meet the class iv surface water quality standards gb3838 2022 cod 30 mg l nh3 n 1 5 mg l and tp 0 3 mg l the required reductions of cod nh3 n and tp concentrations at the critical river location were set at 4 64 33 85 and 61 34 respectively from the baseline scenario a typical solution which can make all pollutant indicators cod nh3 n and tp meet class iv surface water quality standards within the minimal cost was selected from the pareto sets of scenario iv with the new framework the typical solution that reduces runoff volume flood volume and tp concentration by 40 71 36 06 and 61 80 respectively can be realized at a cost of 95 29 million cny comparatively other optimal frontiers would yield comparable benefits at a cost of 131 78 128 11 and 110 83 million cny corresponding to scenarios i ii and iii representing a 38 29 34 44 and 16 83 increase in expenditures respectively the results revealed the framework s capacity to provide more cost effective options to satisfy a water quality target this can be explained in two aspects 1 in scenario i and ii runoff and pollutant emissions are minimized across the overland catchment however in scenario iii and iv the incorporation of instream processes may affect the effect of lid bmps from certain catchments 2 by contemplating a more refined layout of lid bmps to produce more targeted optimal solutions scenario ii and iv next we ll investigate this phenomenon through a more comprehensive data analysis firstly the catchment scale overland runoff and pollutant load generation as well as the water quality index of the respective outfalls were compared to prevent interference between various catchment sizes runoff volume and pollution load per unit area were computed for each catchment fig 8 a fig 8 b depicts the simulation water quality index for the river section corresponding to the catchment outlet eq 34 significant spatial heterogeneity characterizes the distribution of runoff generation and pollutant load transportation and building are the primary non point sources of pollution in urbanized areas flood et al 2022 catchments 8 and 11 are the primary contributors to nutrient loss however the catchments surrounding the outlets of 4 and 5 are substantially more severely contaminated with dispersed contaminants than other regions given the unpredictability of precipitation factors and the diffusiveness of nps pollution the relationship between pollution emissions and their effects on water quality may not always be linear 34 r i i n d e x t 0 t c t s d t t where t represents the specific moment d t represents the total simulation duration d c t represents the simulation concentration of water quality at moment t mg l s j represents the water quality standard mg l then the reductions in overland based runoff and pollutant load under various optimization scenarios were compared as shown in fig 9 the spatial distribution of runoff volume and load reductions in overland region might vary considerably between optimization scenarios it should be mentioned that the values depicted on the graph are the mean of the results from various pareto sets a more dramatic change in runoff volume and pollutant load reduction in the optimization scenario taking into account the spatial difference of implementation ratio scenarios ii and iv which corresponds to a more cost effective pareto front see fig 7 this indicates that despite the fact that the total volume and load reductions in the entire watershed are roughly the same across different optimization scenarios the spatial allocation of the reductions to different catchments can have vastly varying cost effectiveness the significance of spatial allocation in refined lid bmps planning was once again underscored by the totality of these observations scenario i and ii conducted the majority of runoff and pollutant reduction in catchments with large overland pollutant loads despite the fact that water quality standards were not met resulting in a waste of time and resources nonetheless the ultimate objective of management is to enhance water quality in receiving water bodies in plain river network area in this regard the optimization schemes identified based on the reductions of pollutant load and runoff volume in overland area may not give sufficient support to guide the implementation of lid bmps without tying pollutants abatement to compliance with site specific water quality goals this could lead to ineffective placement of lid bmps or failure to meet water quality targets scenario iii and iv have runoff and pollution reductions that are compatible with the river water quality index it makes sense since the strategy incorporated the connection between pollutant sources and instream loads taking into account both overland nutrient losses and instream transport processes it yields modest spatial optimization outcomes this is a crucial discovery regarding the new framework which may be explained by the fact that the new framework focuses on the pollutant load actually reaching certain river assessment sections obviously applying lid bmps in these high pollutant generation sites would not contribute to the improvement of water quality in this severely polluted river section in contrast if the previous optimization technique was applied these catchments would have been chosen for their high reductions in the lack of hydrological links there would be no advantages to water quality from the previous approach in this regard the choice of a previous methodology impeded the documentation of cost effective geographical distributions of lid bmps particularly for the improvement of the targeted river section under time and resource constraints consequently it is crucial to consider the water quality response while designing lid bmps the spatial distribution of the average lid bmp spatial allocation ratios assigned to sub catchments is illustrated in fig 10 the optimization results revealed that the implementation distribution of lid bmps was very heterogeneous the variation was likely driven by variances in sub catchment imperviousness slope and soil permeability specifically catchments 5 9 and 10 have a large proportion of allotted area indicating a strong potential for lid bmp implementation for runoff control and pollution reduction in contrast it is not cost effective to implement lid bmps in catchments 1 3 and 7 and the optimization results indicate just a small portion of these catchments installing lid bmps in these catchments would not be an appropriate allocation of resources bio retention is adopted a high extent which demonstrated it is the most cost effective practices in study area since the placement location of lid bmps fluctuates even when the total number of lid bmps with the same design is fixed the pollutant trapping efficiency will vary chang et al 2007 3 3 key catchment characteristics influencing lid bmps spatial allocation further investigation of the optimization results would shed light on decision making in the real world the average values of optimization spatial allocation ratio at sub catchment scale were used as response variables in a regression analysis this section begins with a report of the subsets regression fig 11 a c e the results reveal that the optimal location and size of lid bmps are a function of density slope imperviousness land use and distance to river all subsets regression for the optimal three models are listed in table 2 this study is the first to describe the spatial characteristics of lid bmp implementation based on catchment characteristics using these data the variables cod nh3 n and tp which represent the proportions of land use types slope and imperviousness had positive effects on the ratio but elevation and distance to river had negative relationships earlier investigations also demonstrated this effect johnes and heathwaite 1997 lane et al 2009 the relative importance of imperviousness was much greater than that of all other regression variables in general implementing lid bmps to places with high imperviousness is more successful than applying universal restrictions or random placement in this regard sites with a high imperviousness may be the most cost effective locations to use lid bmps for environmental improvement lid bmps positioned in locations with more imperviousness can have a greater impact on regional hydrological regimes allowing for the generation collection and treatment of voluminous amounts of rainfall runoff nonetheless the distance to the outlet could be highly connected with the installation of lid bmps according to chang et al 2009 the major stream of the watershed and the area downstream of it are the best places for lid bmps to be implemented however in the plain river network area it can be challenging to tell which way the stream is flowing 4 discussions numerous simulation optimization frameworks linked with hydrological models and multi objective optimization algorithms have been developed for optimal design of lid bmps baek et al 2015 yin et al 2022 this study s unique framework for the spatial allocation optimization of lid bmps demonstrates its dependability in the optimization process we ultimately acquired the desirable construction plan incorporating the optimal size and placement of lid bmps for sponge city s design the proposed method for spatial optimization was compared to the previous method by incorporating the receiving waters responses and accounting for spatial differences in implementation ratio the optimal lid bmp schemes are more cost effective which could lead to more successful watershed management the framework is optimal for but not limited to the plain river network region planning lid bmps requires a thorough comprehension of the influence of lid bmps spatial allocation on overland river hydrologic dynamics limited emphasis has been paid to hydrological connection between land based pollution sources and water bodies yu et al 2015 early research made extensive use of spatial optimization but the links between runoff pollutant abatement and compliance with water quality regulations were rarely explored which may result in unproductive decision making hou et al 2019 yang and best 2015 in this regard existing optimization methodologies are predicated on the local effectiveness of lid bmps as opposed to their effect on water quality partial optimization cannot account for interactions between overland and water hence it is impossible to get optimal global solutions location and size of lid bmps are the most important decision variables during spatial allocation optimization zhang and chui 2018 according to lerer et al 2015 the spatial allocation of lid bmps can be described primarily by implementation ratio and location first the lid bmp implementation ratio is one of the most important aspects since it controls the amount of precipitation that can be infiltrated the location of lid bmps is particularly important as land use and geology conditions can vary greatly between sites the concept of varied source area adequately explains these components effects martin mikle et al 2015 therefore location insensitive optimal designs are only local optimal for this particular site case the effect of lid bmps may vary depending on the installation pattern and location in this regard the placement of practices of the same size throughout the region does not permit targeted watershed management alves et al 2019 eckart et al 2018 here the optimization model analyzes different combinations of lid bmps for each sub catchment to maximize efficiency in reducing stormwater runoff and pollution based on the hydrological and geographical features of each sub catchment in fact the optimal location may vary from case to case depending heavily on catchment characteristics similar to our findings hwang et al 2017 found that the spatial distribution of directly connected impervious dcia affects the volume of runoff they recommended placing lid bmps in regions with a high concentration of dcia eckart et al 2018 reported that lid bmps should be installed in locations with significant runoff regarding the site of lid bmps however these studies provide no more suggestions or clarifications this study quantified the relationship between the ratio of imperviousness area and the ratio of lid bmp implementation areas the mechanism from the standpoint of catchment characteristics was elucidated making lid bmps management more targeted existing surrogate based optimization approaches are primarily motivated by a providing quick forecasts with less computational overhead b the capacity to handle complicated nonlinear problems and c the ability to accommodate multiple input variables and outputs in a single model run seyedashraf et al 2018 this study revealed that surrogates might not only improve compute performance but also simulate and optimize without adding major errors incorporating a more realistic but simpler simulator would significantly reduce computing complexity while fully utilizing the strength of an integrated model it has been demonstrated to dramatically accelerate process based optimization approximately 100 000 simulations of a rapid response water quality model were required for the optimization procedure in this work in general efdc requires 40 min to run for one year 10 min time step assuming the optimization method calls the efdc model 100 000 times to achieve the optimal solution it will require around 2800 days of cpu time 40100000 60 24 2800 in comparison each simulation for the developed rapid response water quality model takes only 10 s thus an optimization approach based on a rapid response water quality model will produce the optimal solution in 3 h with a reduction in computational requirement of 224 000 times 5 conclusions to determine the optimal spatial allocation of lid bmps a simulation optimization framework that incorporates receiving waters responses was presented pingjang new city a plain river network area with high nps pollution utilized the framework 1 the optimal designs of lid bmps required the incorporation of receiving waters responses and refined spatial allocation in order to provide cost effective solutions when runoff volume flood volume and tp concentration are reduced by 40 71 36 06 and 61 80 respectively the newly proposed framework can save 34 44 and 16 31 cost compared to the approach that does not consider receiving waters responses and refined spatial planning 2 imperviousness had the most important relative importance in determining optimal spatial allocation of lid bmps the optimization framework proposed in this study can be simply used to the development of pareto optimal fronts for any other

15497,deep insights into the receiving waters responses to optimal spatial allocation of lid bmps are considered extremely important this study addressed the urgent need to incorporate receiving waters responses into the spatial allocation optimization of lid bmps and demonstrated the efficiency of the approach to guide watershed management the integration of an overland river coupling model and the nsga iii algorithm resulted in the proposal of a general simulation optimization framework for the optimal layout of lid bmps the coupled model was swapped out for the surrogates to increase computational efficiency when 40 71 36 06 and 61 80 reductions in runoff volume flood volume and tp concentration are achieved the newly proposed framework can save 34 44 and 16 31 cost compared to the approach that does not consider receiving waters responses and refined spatial allocation respectively results indicate that the incorporation of receiving waters responses and refined spatial allocation are essential for the optimal design of lid bmps this new framework offers the potential for more cost effective high cost solutions the results of spatial optimization are significantly influenced by imperviousness graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lid bmps simulation optimization spatial optimization receiving waters responses data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the middle and lower portions of the yangtze river plain in china are highly inhabited and have a vibrant economy excessive runoff induced by rapid urbanization has led to flooding and water quality deterioration in receiving water bodies conley et al 2009 making it difficult to achieve sustainable economic growth in these areas low impact development best management practices lid bmps have recently gained popularity as a means of mitigating urban water problems jia et al 2015 the benefits of lid bmps are strongly localized and exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity jia et al 2022 the refined optimal layout of lid bmps is in great demand in order to maximize a variety of goals such as runoff volume control flood risk mitigation and non point source nps pollution control due to the typical hydrological pattern rainfall runoff is first treated by lid bmps in a plain river network region before being discharged to receiving water bodies through the drainage system the overland area and the river are not separate but should be viewed as a coherent entity leng et al 2020 however previous studies have tended to model overland and river systems separately zhang and chui 2020 an integrated tool is required to effectively reflect the overland and river processes numerous simulation optimization techniques combine optimization algorithms with stormwater management models baek et al 2015 jean et al 2022 tang et al 2021 however research gaps still exist in both incorporating receiving waters responses and refined spatial allocation the responses of receiving water bodies to runoff control and pollutant load abatement have so far only rarely been addressed in spatial optimization of lid bmps which mainly focuses on the optimization of runoff volume control and pollutant loads reduction in the overland area yang and best 2015 zeng et al 2019 the optimal allocation of lid bmps must be guided by the receiving waters responses to spatially heterogeneous runoff and pollution abatement which cannot be represented by an overland optimization technique that ignores pollutant transit and transformation processes in river channels due to the research gap the optimal lid bmp strategies might not achieve the desired water quality target rezazadeh helmi et al 2019 the overland and river objects should be taken into account in an optimization procedure hence a comprehensive optimization approach should be utilized in addition an integrated model that can characterize the relationship between lid bmps and receiving waters responses is also crucial for lid bmps spatial optimization at the same time the majority of earlier studies only concentrated on optimal sizing which is defined by the area percentage of lid bmps showing just the lid bmps density but not the spatial distribution johnson and sample 2017 the performance of lid bmps can vary greatly depending on location jia et al 2022 some research pre determined the priority areas for lid bmps by considering solely topographical factors nevertheless the locations identified may not be the optimal locations as the unpredictability of practices is not taken into account meerow and newell 2017 zhao et al 2018 the refined design of lid bmps requires us to optimize the size and location of lid bmps as a whole it is crucial to develop a strategy to optimize spatial layout of lid bmps considering the receiving waters responses the computationally expensive and technically complex execution of high dimensional models particularly for numerous models runs was seen as problematic in the optimization phase motivated by concerns about computational efficiency researchers have sought innovative approaches to alleviate the tremendous computational demands creating effective surrogate models to replace the complex model is a possible option due to the complexity nonlinearity time lag and instability of the water environment system the long short term memory network lstm model is able to predict water quality time series data over an extended period of time castrillo and garcía 2020 research into linking the efdc model to lstm has been increasing to an extent zou 2013 utilized efdc and lstm to undertake an investigation of the water quality risk liang et al 2020 demonstrated that lstm can imitate the predictive capacity of efdc by using lstm to predict chl a to address the time cost limitation for high dimensional models a rapid response water quality model had to be integrated into the optimization process as a surrogate to fill the above knowledge gaps a general simulation optimization framework for refined lid bmps spatial allocation incorporating receiving waters responses was proposed in this study to our knowledge this was the first attempt to incorporate receiving waters responses into the optimal layout of lid bmps the coupled swmm efdc model was developed to offer indications for evaluating the performance of lid bmps schemes incorporating both overland and river processes a sophisticated efdc simulation system will be replaced with a rapid response water quality model that combines the latin hypercube sampling method with the lstm model the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm iii nsga iii was chosen as the engine for multi objective optimization due to its superior performance to identify the most influential catchment characteristics on spatial optimization the relative importance of a predictor was determined the sponge city pilot area pingjiang new city in suzhou was used as a representative case study 2 material and methodology the methodology framework is depicted in fig 1 1 an overland river coupling model for simulating overland and instream processes under the lid bmps scenarios and 2 a spatial optimization module for determining the optimal lid bmps spatial allocation 2 1 study area located in suzhou jiangsu province pingjiang new city was chosen for our case study fig 2 a the total area is 5 5 km2 the annual average air temperature is 16 6 c and the annual average precipitation is about 1163 mm 67 8 of the annual precipitation falls between april and september which corresponds to the flooding season the selection of lid bmps is mainly based on technical guidelines for selection method of sponge city low impact development facilities cecs 2021 cecs standard mainly edited by our research group and the local characteristics of study area bio retention br permeable pavement pp and green roof gr had the highest score and then were adopted structure and cost information of lid bmps can be found in section 3 of the si the study area is a typical example of sponge city s construction and the abundance of basic data enables our case study meanwhile stormwater runoff is discharged directly into rivers via a separate drainage system established in the study area due to the typical plain river network region pattern the chosen area also encompasses a significant portion of china since great progress has been made in recent years to address point source pollution excessive nps load has become a rising hazard to water quality improvement it is expected that the study s outcomes will serve as a basis for future relevant research 2 2 overland river coupling model swmm efdc an integrated overland area and river model was developed toestimate the environmental benefits of each lid bmps configuration the overland section estimates the flow and contaminants delivered into the waterway from each sub catchment the river section replicates the water routing and nutrient transfer throughout the channels network here we present the simplified procedures sections 1 and 2 of the si contains the main parameters setup calibration and validation results 2 2 1 overland area model development we use swmm model to simulate rainfall runoff and pipe flow in overland system the swmm contains of computing modules such as rainfall runoff and pipe flow etc rossman and huber 2016 the rainfall runoff module which is dominated by hydrological computing describes the formation and concentration of runoff in a dynamic manner the pipe flow module replicates the hydromechanical flow routing mechanism in drainage pipe network the swmm model was chosen because it is widely used to evaluate the hydrological and water quality performance of lid bmps using a mature lid module in addition since swmm is a open source software it can be further enhanced and integrated into other applications using custom computer scripts based on land use pipelines and river networks 393 sub catchments were defined within the study area fig 2 b the drainage network was simplified and consisted of 373 junctions 97 outfalls and 373 conduits two types of parameters were used measured parameters and empirical parameters the measured parameters included area slope width impervious percentage conduit length etc the empirical parameters such as infiltration coefficient manning s n value of impervious pervious areas and depression storage of impervious pervious areas need to be adjusted through model calibration and validation three main pollutants were considered in the modeling chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total phosphorus tp to fully analyze the design schemes a one year precipitation 2018 year is employed in the model simulation annual precipitation in suzhou in 2018 is close to the average annual precipitation for the past two decades which is representative of precipitation conditions in the study area 2 2 2 river network model development efdc model was used to build a three dimensional water quality model the efdc model can replicate a variety of water systems including rivers lakes estuaries and oceans efdc model mainly includes hydrodynamics module water quality module and sediment transport module etc hamrick 1992 based on the study needs hydrodynamic and water quality modules were used the hydrodynamic module s output can be directly communicated to the water quality module to facilitate the internal movement of contaminants the water quality module of efdc can simulate the reaction kinetics of algae carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silicon a total of 22 state variables are involved fig s1 given that this study focuses on simulating cod nh3 n and tp the water quality module mainly simulates carbon reaction kinetics nitrogen reaction kinetics and phosphorus reaction kinetics efdc is frequently employed to quantify a river s response to external loads and assess the effectiveness of initiatives pyo et al 2021 using the two dimensional orthogonal curvilinear grid tool 409 divided grid cells were generated fig 2 b the average grid dimensions dx were 19 55 meters dy was 23 61 meters and the average orthogonal deviation was 2 79 3 the meteorological boundary is represented by time varying data from local monitoring stations which includes atmospheric pressure air temperature relative humidity precipitation evaporation solar radiation cloud cover etc the inflows consist of water transfer from upstream and rainfall runoff the water level is regulated by gates and pumps the duration of the experiment is from january 1 to december 31 2018 with 10 min steps and daily output 2 2 3 model coupling fig 1 depicts a loosely coupled model linking swmm and efdc the two model structures were left unaltered and were integrated via external file input and output rather than internal function calls the fundamental swmm processing units known as sub catchments are decentralized blocks and cannot be utilized for overland river coupled system management the catchment is used to build land source water sink interactions between the overland river network as a typical hydrological response unit the study area is generalized into 12 catchments from 393 sub catchments fig 2 b the swmm output file s flow and conc contain information on the flow and pollutants concentration at each catchment outfall the output data of swmm can be utilized as the input data of efdc where flow corresponds to qser inp and conc corresponds to dser inp according to the discharge grid of each outfall in the river furthermore efdc is able to simulate river dynamics after obtaining flow and pollutants within the integrated python platform the coupled procedure was automatically

the fitness value during the iterative optimization process swmm efdc has to be executed numerous times resulting in a time consuming global search to ease the computational effort a rapid response water quality model was developed by combining a process based model with lstm to quickly capture the primary relationship between lid bmps schemes and water quality response specifically the input data of lstm are the surface runoff and pollutants series under the implementation of lid bmps and the output is the water quality response after inputting the surface runoff and pollutants series into an efdc coupling simulation the flowchart for the rapid response water quality model is depicted in fig 4 following is a detailed description of the procedures step 1 random reduction module the

established they are 1 maximizing the runoff volume reduction eq 19 2 maximizing the flood volume reduction and eq 20 3 maximizing the pollutants concentration deduction eq 21 the runoff volume represents the portion of the flow that is yielded at the source s surface and discharged through the outfall the flood volume is the portion that exceeds the capacity of the drainage network and thus overflows from the network to measure whether the water response meets surface water quality criteria the degree of improvement of the pollutant concentration in the receiving water body is taken into account the cost of lid bmps was estimated using the life cycle cost model lcc three components of the associated cost should be taken into account from an engineering standpoint capital expenses during the construction stage operation and maintenance costs during the operation stage and the salvage value during the end stage xu et al 2021 the present value of cost in eq 22 was used to

objectives nsga iii was utilized as the optimization algorithm in this work deb and jain 2014 studies have demonstrated that nsga iii is superior to nsga ii in maintaining diversity and achieving convergence when solving optimization problems with up to fifty objectives bhesdadiya et al 2016 for this reason nsga iii was chosen to solve the 6 objective optimization problem nsga iii has been modified relative to the algorithm of the previous generation nsga ii by incorporating a reference point based selection mechanism the nsga iii framework is depicted in fig 1 the population size

requirements are met eqs 19 and 22 were selected as the fitness function for the selection of individuals during the iterative phase of nsga iii individuals who violated the constraints expressed in eqs 25 and 27 were removed 2 3 4 optimization scenarios setting four optimization scenarios were established to validate the global optimality of the simulation optimization methodology suggested table 1 i and ii scenarios are based on the effects of lid bmps on runoff and pollutant emissions from each overland spatial unit but do not account for the transmission of pollutants downstream the efdc model was used again to determine the water quality response of each lid bmps solution after the pareto optimum front was formed in scenario i and ii in scenarios i and iii the same implementation ratio is specified for all sub catchments 2 4 identification of key catchment characteristics influencing on spatial optimization 2 in an effort to identify the key catchment characteristics influencing the spatial optimization results of lid bmps we gathered a list of previously published environmental factors including slope elevation imperviousness land use and distance to river jia et al 2013 the land use variable is represented by the emc values of cod nh3 n and tp which refer to the proportions of land use types we define distance to river as the distance between a sub catchment and the location at which its outflow enters the river channel the inherent diversity of catchment characteristics necessitates the use of diversity models in order to comprehend how catchment factors may impact the lid bmps configuration all subsets regression offers all conceivable variable selection combinations with varying fitting performances this approach provides numerous model selection options wasserman and sudjianto 1994 were utilized in this study for each separate multivariable regression technique all conceivable combinations of significant catchment characteristics were produced and the statistical significance of the covariable coefficients was assessed data analysis was conducted using the glmulti package of r 28 φ i k 1 x 1 k 2 x 2 k 3 x 3 k 4

200 iterations are generated three scenarios with 50 pollutants reduction ratio of cod nh3 n and tp the study area management target were selected as out of sample test sets based on the sliding window method a total of 363 197 71511 training and validation samples were generated from the remaining 197 scenarios 71511 80 57208 training sequences and 71511 80 14302 validation sequences validation samples are used to determine hyperparameters of lstm si table s12 fig 5 compared the lstm and efdc calculation outcomes where the data points in each plot congregate on the left and right sides of the diagonal the training results of the lstm are shown in fig 5 a c and e the testing performance of the lstm is displayed in fig 5 b d and f these developed lstm models are predicted to perform well in terms of fitting and prediction the model has an excellent generalization performance with minimal error according to the three out of sample test results fig 6 peak concentrations of cod nh3 n and tp often occur in the summer june to august and are mainly caused by rainfall events 3 2 comparison among the optimization results the final four dimensional pareto optimal front of the proposed simulation optimization framework was compared to those achieved by other optimization strategies fig 7 the runoff volume reduction flood volume reduction and pollutant concentration decrease are depicted on the x y and z axes respectively the cost is denoted by marker color both i ii and iii scenarios are dominated by the pareto front solutions of iv interestingly the pareto optimal fronts of these four scenarios had comparable costs within the low cost range this could be explained by the fact that cheaper lid bmps were recognized simultaneously by all four scenarios at an early stage of evolution nonetheless obvious vertical distances could be noticed between the four curves in places with higher costs indicating that the suggested framework outperformed previous frameworks in these ranges to meet the class iv surface water quality standards gb3838 2022 cod 30 mg l nh3 n 1 5 mg l and tp 0 3 mg l the required reductions of cod nh3 n and tp concentrations at the critical river location were set at 4 64 33 85 and 61 34 respectively from the baseline scenario a typical solution which can make all pollutant indicators cod nh3 n and tp meet class iv surface water quality standards within the minimal cost was selected from the pareto sets of scenario iv with the new framework the typical solution that reduces runoff volume flood volume and tp concentration by 40 71 36 06 and 61 80 respectively can be realized at a cost of 95 29 million cny comparatively other optimal frontiers would yield comparable benefits at a cost of 131 78 128 11 and 110 83 million cny corresponding to scenarios i ii and iii representing a 38 29 34 44 and 16 83 increase in expenditures respectively the results revealed the framework s capacity to provide more cost effective options to satisfy a water quality target this can be explained in two aspects 1 in scenario i and ii runoff and pollutant emissions are minimized across the overland catchment however in scenario iii and iv the incorporation of instream processes may affect the effect of lid bmps from certain catchments 2 by contemplating a more refined layout of lid bmps to produce more targeted optimal solutions scenario ii and iv next we ll investigate this phenomenon through a more comprehensive data analysis firstly the catchment scale overland runoff and pollutant load generation as well as the water quality index of the respective outfalls were compared to prevent interference between various catchment sizes runoff volume and pollution load per unit area were computed for each catchment fig 8 a fig 8 b depicts the simulation water quality index for the river section corresponding to the catchment outlet eq 34 significant spatial heterogeneity characterizes the distribution of runoff generation and pollutant load transportation and building are the primary non point sources of pollution in urbanized areas flood et al 2022 catchments 8 and 11 are the primary contributors to nutrient loss however the catchments surrounding the outlets of 4 and 5 are substantially more severely contaminated with dispersed contaminants than other regions given the unpredictability of precipitation factors and the diffusiveness of nps pollution the relationship between pollution emissions and their effects on water quality may not always be linear 34 r i i n d e x t 0 t c t s d t t where t represents the specific moment d t represents the total simulation duration d c t represents the simulation concentration of water quality at moment t mg l s j represents the water quality standard mg l then the reductions in overland based runoff and pollutant load under various optimization scenarios were compared as shown in fig 9 the spatial distribution of runoff volume and load reductions in overland region might vary considerably between optimization scenarios it should be mentioned that the values depicted on the graph are the mean of the results from various pareto sets a more dramatic change in runoff volume and pollutant load reduction in the optimization scenario taking into account the spatial difference of implementation ratio scenarios ii and iv which corresponds to a more cost effective pareto front see fig 7 this indicates that despite the fact that the total volume and load reductions in the entire watershed are roughly the same across different optimization scenarios the spatial allocation of the reductions to different catchments can have vastly varying cost effectiveness the significance of spatial allocation in refined lid bmps planning was once again underscored by the totality of these observations scenario i and ii conducted the majority of runoff and pollutant reduction in catchments with large overland pollutant loads despite the fact that water quality standards were not met resulting in a waste of time and resources nonetheless the ultimate objective of management is to enhance water quality in receiving water bodies in plain river network area in this regard the optimization schemes identified based on the reductions of pollutant load and runoff volume in overland area may not give sufficient support to guide the implementation of lid bmps without tying pollutants abatement to compliance with site specific water quality goals this could lead to ineffective placement of lid bmps or failure to meet water quality targets scenario iii and iv have runoff and pollution reductions that are compatible with the river water quality index it makes sense since the strategy incorporated the connection between pollutant sources and instream loads taking into account both overland nutrient losses and instream transport processes it yields modest spatial optimization outcomes this is a crucial discovery regarding the new framework which may be explained by the fact that the new framework focuses on the pollutant load actually reaching certain river assessment sections obviously applying lid bmps in these high pollutant generation sites would not contribute to the improvement of water quality in this severely polluted river section in contrast if the previous optimization technique was applied these catchments would have been chosen for their high reductions in the lack of hydrological links there would be no advantages to water quality from the previous approach in this regard the choice of a previous methodology impeded the documentation of cost effective geographical distributions of lid bmps particularly for the improvement of the targeted river section under time and resource constraints consequently it is crucial to consider the water quality response while designing lid bmps the spatial distribution of the average lid bmp spatial allocation ratios assigned to sub catchments is illustrated in fig 10 the optimization results revealed that the implementation distribution of lid bmps was very heterogeneous the variation was likely driven by variances in sub catchment imperviousness slope and soil permeability specifically catchments 5 9 and 10 have a large proportion of allotted area indicating a strong potential for lid bmp implementation for runoff control and pollution reduction in contrast it is not cost effective to implement lid bmps in catchments 1 3 and 7 and the optimization results indicate just a small portion of these catchments installing lid bmps in these catchments would not be an appropriate allocation of resources bio retention is adopted a high extent which demonstrated it is the most cost effective practices in study area since the placement location of lid bmps fluctuates even when the total number of lid bmps with the same design is fixed the pollutant trapping efficiency will vary chang et al 2007 3 3 key catchment characteristics influencing lid bmps spatial allocation further investigation of the optimization results would shed light on decision making in the real world the average values of optimization spatial allocation ratio at sub catchment scale were used as response variables in a regression analysis this section begins with a report of the subsets regression fig 11 a c e the results reveal that the optimal location and size of lid bmps are a function of density slope imperviousness land use and distance to river all subsets regression for the optimal three models are listed in table 2 this study is the first to describe the spatial characteristics of lid bmp implementation based on catchment characteristics using these data the variables cod nh3 n and tp which represent the proportions of land use types slope and imperviousness had positive effects on the ratio but elevation and distance to river had negative relationships earlier investigations also demonstrated this effect johnes and heathwaite 1997 lane et al 2009 the relative importance of imperviousness was much greater than that of all other regression variables in general implementing lid bmps to places with high imperviousness is more successful than applying universal restrictions or random placement in this regard sites with a high imperviousness may be the most cost effective locations to use lid bmps for environmental improvement lid bmps positioned in locations with more imperviousness can have a greater impact on regional hydrological regimes allowing for the generation collection and treatment of voluminous amounts of rainfall runoff nonetheless the distance to the outlet could be highly connected with the installation of lid bmps according to chang et al 2009 the major stream of the watershed and the area downstream of it are the best places for lid bmps to be implemented however in the plain river network area it can be challenging to tell which way the stream is flowing 4 discussions numerous simulation optimization frameworks linked with hydrological models and multi objective optimization algorithms have been developed for optimal design of lid bmps baek et al 2015 yin et al 2022 this study s unique framework for the spatial allocation optimization of lid bmps demonstrates its dependability in the optimization process we ultimately acquired the desirable construction plan incorporating the optimal size and placement of lid bmps for sponge city s design the proposed method for spatial optimization was compared to the previous method by incorporating the receiving waters responses and accounting for spatial differences in implementation ratio the optimal lid bmp schemes are more cost effective which could lead to more successful watershed management the framework is optimal for but not limited to the plain river network region planning lid bmps requires a thorough comprehension of the influence of lid bmps spatial allocation on overland river hydrologic dynamics limited emphasis has been paid to hydrological connection between land based pollution sources and water bodies yu et al 2015 early research made extensive use of spatial optimization but the links between runoff pollutant abatement and compliance with water quality regulations were rarely explored which may result in unproductive decision making hou et al 2019 yang and best 2015 in this regard existing optimization methodologies are predicated on the local effectiveness of lid bmps as opposed to their effect on water quality partial optimization cannot account for interactions between overland and water hence it is impossible to get optimal global solutions location and size of lid bmps are the most important decision variables during spatial allocation optimization zhang and chui 2018 according to lerer et al 2015 the spatial allocation of lid bmps can be described primarily by implementation ratio and location first the lid bmp implementation ratio is one of the most important aspects since it controls the amount of precipitation that can be infiltrated the location of lid bmps is particularly important as land use and geology conditions can vary greatly between sites the concept of varied source area adequately explains these components effects martin mikle et al 2015 therefore location insensitive optimal designs are only local optimal for this particular site case the effect of lid bmps may vary depending on the installation pattern and location in this regard the placement of practices of the same size throughout the region does not permit targeted watershed management alves et al 2019 eckart et al 2018 here the optimization model analyzes different combinations of lid bmps for each sub catchment to maximize efficiency in reducing stormwater runoff and pollution based on the hydrological and geographical features of each sub catchment in fact the optimal location may vary from case to case depending heavily on catchment characteristics similar to our findings hwang et al 2017 found that the spatial distribution of directly connected impervious dcia affects the volume of runoff they recommended placing lid bmps in regions with a high concentration of dcia eckart et al 2018 reported that lid bmps should be installed in locations with significant runoff regarding the site of lid bmps however these studies provide no more suggestions or clarifications this study quantified the relationship between the ratio of imperviousness area and the ratio of lid bmp implementation areas the mechanism from the standpoint of catchment characteristics was elucidated making lid bmps management more targeted existing surrogate based optimization approaches are primarily motivated by a providing quick forecasts with less computational overhead b the capacity to handle complicated nonlinear problems and c the ability to accommodate multiple input variables and outputs in a single model run seyedashraf et al 2018 this study revealed that surrogates might not only improve compute performance but also simulate and optimize without adding major errors incorporating a more realistic but simpler simulator would significantly reduce computing complexity while fully utilizing the strength of an integrated model it has been demonstrated to dramatically accelerate process based optimization approximately 100 000 simulations of a rapid response water quality model were required for the optimization procedure in this work in general efdc requires 40 min to run for one year 10 min time step assuming the optimization method calls the efdc model 100 000 times to achieve the optimal solution it will require around 2800 days of cpu time 40100000 60 24 2800 in comparison each simulation for the developed rapid response water quality model takes only 10 s thus an optimization approach based on a rapid response water quality model will produce the optimal solution in 3 h with a reduction in computational requirement of 224 000 times 5 conclusions to determine the optimal spatial allocation of lid bmps a simulation optimization framework that incorporates receiving waters responses was presented pingjang new city a plain river network area with high nps pollution utilized the framework 1 the optimal designs of lid bmps required the incorporation of receiving waters responses and refined spatial allocation in order to provide cost effective solutions when runoff volume flood volume and tp concentration are reduced by 40 71 36 06 and 61 80 respectively the newly proposed framework can save 34 44 and 16 31 cost compared to the approach that does not consider receiving waters responses and refined spatial planning 2 imperviousness had the most important relative importance in determining optimal spatial allocation of lid bmps the optimization framework proposed in this study can be simply used to the development of pareto optimal fronts for any other

15498,thermally activated peroxydisulfate in situ chemical oxidation tap isco is often applied for the remediation of soil sorbed hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs and nonaqueous phase liquids napls which act as long term sources of groundwater contamination tap isco benefits from improved desorption dissolution of organic contaminants into the aqueous phase and efficient activation of peroxydisulfate at elevated temperatures but the primary limitation of tap isco is the short lifetime of peroxydisulfate therefore the availability of reactive radical species to resolve this problem coupling of peroxide stabilizers with tap were tested the compatibility of seven representative commercial organic and inorganic peroxide stabilizers including sodium stannate trisodium phosphate sodium pyrophosphate sodium silicate sodium citrate ethylene diamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt with tap in aqueous solutions and solutions containing goethite or soil particles were first studied the effects of stabilizers on the formation distribution and reactivity of reactive oxygen species were then investigated through electron paramagnetic resonance epr spin trapping experiments using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide chemical probe experiments using anisole nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane and biphasic trichloroethylene tce dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls tap isco mimicking experiments the results indicate that organic stabilizers significantly accelerate peroxydisulfate decomposition at both ambient and elevated temperatures in contrast inorganic stabilizers can markedly increase peroxydisulfate longevity by suppressing the acid catalyzed peroxydisulfate decomposition quenching radical chain acceleration and sequestering transition metal species in addition tap systems containing inorganic stabilizers can effectively generate a variety of reactive radical species including so4 ho and o2 and improve the oxidation of anisole and nitrobenzene though suppressing the reduction of hexachloroethane to some extent especially suitable inorganic stabilizers e g trisodium phosphate can effectively improve tap oxidation of tce dnapl while suppressing peroxydisulfate decomposition overall this study provides the fundamental basis of coupling tap isco with peroxide stabilizers

last two decades to address soils and groundwater contaminated by organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons chlorinated solvents etc krembs et al 2010 siegrist et al 2011 tsitonaki et al 2010 upon activation of peroxydisulfate the generated reactive radical species e g sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical can rapidly oxidize organic contaminants dissolved in the aqueous phase but the oxidation of soil sorbed hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs and contaminants existed in nonaqueous phase liquids napls which often act as the long term sources of groundwater contamination is hurdled by the slow desorption dissolution of target contaminants into the aqueous phase krembs et al 2010 stroo et al 2012 teel et al 2009 to address this issue thermally activated peroxydisulfate isco tap isco is often employed as elevated temperatures can improve the desorption dissolution of organic contaminants as well as efficiently activating peroxydisulfate peng et al 2015 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2013 however the primary limitation of tap isco is the short lifetime of peroxydisulfate therefore the availability of reactive radical species at elevated temperatures e g t 1 2 is less than four days at 50 c in the subsurface johnson et al 2008 which would constrain the diffusion and dispersion of peroxydisulfate in the contaminated zones and impair the remedial performance the lifetime of peroxydisulfate in the subsurface during tap isco applications depends not only on the thermal homolysis of peroxydisulfate r1 but also on oxidant consumption by natural organic material nom and other reducible species potential accelerated decomposition by subsurface transition metal minerals e g fe mn species etc to meet the oxidant demands of organic contaminants nom and other naturally occurring reducible species in the subsurface high dosage of peroxydisulfate is generally injected added to the treatment zone in isco applications siegrist et al 2011 tsitonaki et al 2010 following peroxydisulfate decomposition often leads to momentary acidification of the treatment zone huling and pivetz 2006 tsitonaki et al 2010 under acidic conditions e g ph 3 acid autocatalyzed hydrolysis r2 can markedly accelerate peroxydisulfate decomposition kolthoff and miller 1951 additionally dissolved transition metal cations denoted as mn in the groundwater and subsurface minerals denoted as mn e g goethite may catalyze peroxydisulfate decomposition r3 and r4 liu et al 2014 in addition if residual peroxydisulfate is still present in high concentrations so4 ho may react with residual s2o8 2 which may initiate and propagate cyclic radical chain reactions r5 and r6 that can substantially accelerate peroxydisulfate decomposition house 1962 wang wu and deng 2020 zhu et al 2018 these side reactions may significantly reduce the lifetime of peroxydisulfate and the efficacy of tap isco however little attention has been paid to address these issues as peroxydisulfate is generally considered a stable oxidant with studies primarily focusing on its activation in isco applications tsitonaki et al 2010 r1 s 2 o 8 2 h e a t s o 4 s o 4 r2 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o h 4 s o 4 2 o

o 5 2 h inspired by the success of industry in using peroxide stabilizes to improve the stability of hydrogen peroxide another commonly used peroxide chemical reichert 1936 schumb 1957 wuorimaa et al 2006 this study intended to improve the lifetime of peroxydisulfate and the efficacy of tap isco with peroxide stabilizers phosphate salts stannate salts etc are typical inorganic peroxide stabilizers while typical organic ones are oftentimes organic chelators such as citric acids salts aminocarboxylic acids salts and aminophosphonic acids salts in industry peroxide stabilizers are often added in commercial hydrogen peroxide products as well as in its applications to stabilize the highly reactive and unstable hydrogen peroxide by primarily acting as transition metal sequesters or radical scavengers to inhibit radical chain run off reactions induced by transition metal species croft et al 1992 wuorimaa et al 2006 as these two peroxide chemicals have similar chemical structures and chemical behaviors peroxide stabilizers theoretically may stabilize peroxydisulfate through similar mechanisms though whether they can suppress acid autocatalyzed peroxydisulfate decomposition or not requires further studies to the best of our knowledge the effects of stabilizers on the fate of peroxydisulfate under thermal activation conditions and tap isco efficacy has not been studied previously therefore a systematic screening of representative commercial peroxide stabilizers was carried out to identify promising ones that can enhance peroxydisulfate longevity at elevated temperatures in aqueous solutions promising stabilizers were then tested for their potential to stabilize peroxydisulfate in the presence of goethite a common subsurface mineral and a soil sample respectively the effects of stabilizers on the formation distribution and reactivity of reactive oxygen species were assessed through electron paramagnetic resonance epr spin trapping experiments using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and chemical probe experiments with anisole as a probe for so4 ho and other oxidative radical species nitrobenzene for ho and hexachloroethane for reductive radical species teel et al 2011 finally the effects of stabilizers on the efficacy of tap isco were tentatively investigated through tap oxidation of trichloroethylene tce dnapl under quiescent conditions tce dnapls are frequently present in chlorinated solvent contaminated sites and tend to slowly but continuously dissolve into surrounding groundwater for decades and even longer henry et al 2003 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sodium peroxydisulfate pds representative inorganic and organic commercial peroxide stabilizers including sodium stannate na2sno3 trisodium phosphate na3po4 sodium pyrophosphate na4p2o7 sodium silicate na2sio3 sodium citrate sct ethylene diamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid edtmp and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt edta 2na and other chemicals were all of analytical grade or better and used as received further information about the stabilizers including their chemical structures is provided in table s1 goethite was synthesized and characterized according to literature procedures pham et al 2012 soil sample tested was collected from an uncontaminated site of our campus treated and characterized as in our previous study wang et al 2014 the dried soil has a ph of 4 96 an organic content of 1 12 wt and an iron content of 3 0 wt 2 2 compatibility of stabilizers with peroxydisulfate in aqueous solutions twenty ml of freshly prepared solutions containing 10 0 g l of individual peroxide stabilizers and 50 0 g l pds were put into 40 ml epa voa vials with ptfe silicone septa caps tests were conducted in temperature controlled shakers at 20 c ambient temperature and 40 c pds activation temperature respectively with continuous shaking at 150 rpm the initial pds dosage and the activation temperature selected was within the ranges of oxidant dosage and activation temperature often applied in isco field applications siegrist et al 2011 tsitonaki et al 2010 the dosage of stabilizers utilized was based on the results of examining the effects of the concentration of na3po4 the most promising stabilizers out of the preliminary screening study on peroxydisulfate decomposition at designated intervals residual peroxydisulfate concentrations and phs of the solutions were determined according to literature procedures wang et al 2017 blank controls with only pds were also run under similar conditions all experiments herein and thereafter were conducted at least in triplicate 2 3 compatibility of stabilizers with peroxydisulfate in the presence of goethite or soil particles further studies were primarily conducted with inorganic stabilizers promising stabilizers out of the above screening studies pds only controls experiments and comparative experiments with sct the organic stabilizer with relatively mild acceleration to peroxydisulfate decomposition were also conducted under similar conditions experiments were conducted at 40 c to examine the potential of stabilizers in stabilizing peroxydisulfate in the presence of goethite and soil particles respectively goethite 0 2 g or soil sample 5 0 g was first added into the vials and following experimental procedures were basically the same as the ones in the above screening experiments at desired time intervals samples were taken out and immediately put into ice water baths the upper aqueous solutions were utilized for the measurement of phs residual peroxydisulfate concentration and dissolved iron concentration cantera et al 2002 toc wu et al 2022 was also monitored if soil present goethite samples remained in the bottom were collected and washed with di water followed by oven drying at 60 c thereafter sem eds pham et al 2012 and ftir analysis yan and jing 2018 of the dried samples were conducted 2 4 probe experiments aqueous solutions of anisole nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane were prepared by dissolving the pure chemicals in di water according to literature procedures teel et al 2011 ten ml of individual probe solution and 10 0 ml of solution containing individual stabilizers 20 0 g l and pds 100 0 g l were added into 40 ml epa voa vials after gentle mixing the capped vials were shaken at 150 rpm at 40 c at designed time intervals samples were taken out and immediately put into ice water baths to quench the oxidation thereafter 5 0 ml of aqueous solution was extracted with 5 0 ml of hexanes the concentrations of residual anisole or nitrobenzene in the extracted hexane solutions were quantified by gc fid while residual hexachloroethane was quantified by gc ecd ahmad et al 2010 teel et al 2011 2 5 electron paramagnetic resonance epr studies epr trapping experiments with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo were conducted to characterize the formation of so4 ho o2 and other radical species formed in the 24 h samples of the aqueous screening experiments individual samples were first immediately put into aqueous dmpo solutions followed by epr analysis of the dmpo adducts wang wu and deng 2020 trapping experiments were also conducted with dmpo dissolved in dmso wang wu and deng 2020 and dmpo dissolved in methanol wang et al 2018 for improved trapping and characterization of so4 and o2 respectively 2 6 oxidation of tce dnapls five ml of di water was first added to a 40 ml conical centrifuge tube followed by the addition of 100 0 μl of tce liquids beneath the water surface with a syringe then 15 0 ml of solutions containing individual stabilizers and pds were added and the samples were sealed with screw ptff silicone septa caps initial concentrations of individual stabilizer and pds in the upper aqueous solutions were 10 0 g l and 50 0 g l respectively to mimic field isco conditions the samples were maintained at 40 c under quiescent conditions without stirring or shaking control experiments with only pds and those with only pure water were also run under similar conditions at designed time intervals the samples were taken out and immediately put into ice water baths to quench the oxidation of tce residual peroxydisulfate concentrations and phs of the upper solutions were measured residual tce in the upper aqueous phase and the bottom organic phase was extracted with hexanes and quantified by gc fid respectively peng et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 compatibility of peroxydisulfate with representative peroxide stabilizers in aqueous solutions time course peroxydisulfate decomposition profiles of pds at 20 c and 40 c in the presence of peroxide stabilizers were shown in fig 1 a 1d initial pds decomposition under all conditions follows the pseudo first order kinetics very well the initial pds decomposition apparent rate constants k d were summarized in fig s1 the kd values at 20 c and 40 c for the pds only system are 5 4 0 93 x 10 3 and 3 6 0 24 x 10 2 d 1 respectively which agree with reported literature values johnson et al 2008 kolthoff and miller 1951 organic stabilizers increase the k d values by 1 7 6 times at 20 c and by 0 5 3 3 times at 40 c in contrast inorganic stabilizers decrease the k d values by 50 consistently at both 20 c and 40 c the results indicate that organic peroxide stabilizers accelerate peroxydisulfate decomposition both at ambient temperature and elevated temperature whereas inorganic stabilizers can effectively suppress peroxydisulfate decomposition accelerated peroxydisulfate decomposition by organic stabilizers may be attributed to cyclic radical chain reactions initiated by the reaction between so4 and organic stabilizers kolthoff and miller 1951 wang wu and deng 2020 these organic stabilizers contain tertiary amine moiety si et al 1995 carboxylic acid moiety criquet et al 2010 madhavan et al 1978 or secondary c h bonds huie and clifton 1989 that readily react with so4 r7 r11 the electron transfer reaction between the amnio group of edta 2na or edtmp and so4 r7 will produce an amino cation radical intermediate that is prone to rearrange and form an alkyl radical as the intermediate r8 the reaction between the carboxylic group of edta 2na or sct and so4 r9 will produce a carboxylic radical that is prone to decarboxylation r10 with an alkyl radical formed as the intermediate in addition so4 can react with all three organic stabilizers through hydrogen abstraction of the secondary c h bonds r11 producing an alkyl radical as the intermediate as well alkyl radicals are known to react rapidly with s2o8 2 r12 leading to peroxydisulfate decomposition and regeneration of another so4 beylerian and khachatrian 1984 as a result organic stabilizers can propagate cyclic radical chain reactions r13 that may markedly accelerate peroxydisulfate decomposition acceleration by cyclic radical chain reactions may also occur in the pds only system but such acceleration is expected to be much milder as s2o8 2 is significantly less reactive toward so4 than the organic stabilizers e g k5 k11 wang wu and deng 2020 r7 r8 r9 s o 4

stabilizers were present initial solution phs were in the alkaline range so4 is prone to convert into ho r14 under alkaline conditions gao et al 2020 guan et al 2011 in the presence of inorganic peroxide stabilizers the stabilizer derived oxyanions may quench both so4 and ho and suppress their acceleration through the cyclic radical chain reactions to some extent neta et al 1988 for example ho the dominant radical species at high ph conditions e g ph 12 reacts much more rapid with po4 3 than s2o8 2 r15 and r16 k15 po4 3 k16 s2o8 2 neta et al 1988 and the generated oxyanion radical po4 2 is less reactive and less likely to react with s2o8 2 than ho thus minimizing acceleration through radical chain reactions under less alkaline conditions e g ph 12 due to acidification by peroxydisulfate decomposition the conversion of so4 into ho is suppressed while po4 3 tends to convert into hpo4 2 the reaction between hpo4 2 and so4 r17 will produce hpo4 neta et al 1988 which is less reactive and less likely to react with s2o8 2 than so4 r14 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 o h k 14 6 5 x 1 0 7 m 1 s 1 r15 h o p o 4 3 h o p o 4 2 k 15 1 1 x 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 r16 s 2 o 8 2 h o s 2 o 8 o h k 16 1

by the time course ph profiles fig s2 the estimated acid catalyzed decomposition rate constant at 40 c is 1 12 h m 1d 1 according to literature report johnson et al 2008 under the conditions herein acid autocatalyzed peroxydisulfate decomposition r2 will become a primary contributor to peroxydisulfate decomposition if solution phs are less than 2 in contrast inorganic stabilizers can mitigate the acidification issue and peroxydisulfate decomposition catalyzed by acids attributed to initial alkaline conditions slower production of protons as a byproduct of peroxydisulfate decomposition and their ability to absorb the protons e g r18 to further explore the impact of acidification to peroxydisulfate decomposition peroxydisulfate decomposition experiments at 40 c in the presence of 0 05 m h2so4 and 0 1 m naoh were conducted respectively as shown in fig s1 the kd value obtained in the presence of h2so4 is about 3 times greater than that of the pds only system whereas the k d value obtained in the presence of naoh is much lower than that of the pds only system the results clearly demonstrate significant acceleration by acid autocatalyzed decomposition r18 p o 4 3 h h p o 4 2 3 2 epr studies as illustrated in fig 2 a and fig s3 dmpo oh signal was dominant in all systems when the dmpo trapping experiments were carried out in aqueous solutions whereas the signals of dmpo so4 dmpo o2 ho2 etc were insignificant relatively speaking the intensity of dmpo oh was strongest in the pds only system the intensities of dmpo oh in the presence of organic stabilizers were slightly lower than that of the pds only system in contrast the intensities of dmpo oh in the presence of inorganic stabilizers were much lower than that of the pds only system however as dmpo oh may be derived from rapid decomposition of dmpo adducts of other reactive oxygen species e g so4 s2o8 o2 finkelstein et al 1982 timmins et al 1999 zhu et al 2018 the intensity of dmpo oh in individual systems cannot infer the presence of ho or its relative steady state concentrations ho ss to improve the characterization of so4 dmpo trapping experiments were then conducted in dmso solutions as the stability of dmpo so4 can be significantly increased in dmso solutions zalibera et al 2009 as illustrated in fig 2b and fig s3 the intensities of dmpo so4 signal in the presence of stabilizers were all lower than that of the pds only system in the pds only system so4 is expected to be primarily quenched by s2o8 2 wang wu and deng 2020 leading to the formation of s2o8 s2o8 may be trapped by dmpo but dmpo s2o8 is not stable prone to decay into to dmpo so4 and a so4 subsequently trapped by dmpo and contributing to the formation of dmpo so4 zhu et al 2018 the relative lower steady state concentrations of so4 so4 ss in the presence of inorganic stabilizers may be attributed to enhanced conversion of so4 into ho under alkaline conditions and quenching of so4 ho and the radical chain reactions by the stabilizers on the other hand the highly reactive organic stabilizers may compete against s2o8 2 and dmpo for available so4 thus suppressing the formation of dmpo so4 in systems containing organic stabilizers trapping of o2 ho2 was conducted in methanol solutions to increase the stability of dmpo o2 ho2 as well as suppressing potential oxidation of o2 ho2 by so4 ho wang et al 2018 protonation of o2 can form ho2 which has a pka of 4 8 as illustrated in fig 2c dmpo o2 ho2 signals were observed in all systems under alkaline conditions base catalyzed hydrolysis of peroxydisulfate r19 forms hydrogen peroxide anion which will be readily oxidized by peroxydisulfate to form so4 and o2 r20 furman et al 2010 under acidic conditions h2o2 may be formed from acid catalyzed hydrolysis of peroxydisulfate r21 r24 kolthoff and miller 1951 subsequent oxidation of h2o2 by so4 r25 leads to the formation of ho2 wei et al 2017 r19 s 2 o 8 2 3 o h h o 2 2 s o 4 2 h 2 o

concentrations of the oxyanion radicals their slow reaction with dmpo or instability of their dmpo adducts it is known that the epr spectra of the dmpo adducts of many oxyanion radicals e g carbonate radical and phosphate radical etc are difficult to obtain kochany and lipczynska kochany 1992 wang and wang 2020 in addition epr signals of dmpo adducts of alkyl radicals intermediates from the oxidation of organic stabilizers by so4 was not observed alkyl radicals are highly reactive toward residual peroxydisulfate which minimizes their accumulation beylerian and khachatrian 1984 3 3 stabilization of peroxydisulfate at elevated temperature in the presence of goethite and soil particles to investigate potential impact of subsurface minerals which can activate peroxydisulfate to the stabilization of peroxydisulfate by the stabilizers time course monitoring of peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of goethite gt were conducted the results are shown in fig 3 a initial peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of gt also fits the pseudo first order kinetics wells as in the homogenous aqueous systems and the kd values are included in fig s4 the kd values for systems containing inorganic stabilizers 0 0093 0 0118 d 1 are much smaller than that of the pds gt system 2 9 0 18 x 10 2 d 1 whereas sct markedly increases the k d value to 5 1 0 34 x 10 2 d 1 the results clearly indicate that inorganic stabilizers are effective at stabilizing peroxydisulfate even in the presence of gt notably the kd values in the pds gt system and gt systems containing inorganic stabilizes are consistently smaller than their corresponding kd values obtained under similar conditions in the aqueous systems without gt present the results indicate gt may suppress peroxydisulfate decomposition to some extent some literature studies have similar observation that metal hydro oxide minerals including iron oxides may suppress peroxydisulfate decomposition attributed to surface scavenging of so4 ho by the minerals e g r26 and r27 crincoli et al 2020 teel et al 2011 though gt may also activate peroxydisulfate to some extent as reported in literature ding et al 2020 such activation will be less important at elevated temperature due to efficient thermal activation r26 fe iii oh s o 4 fe iii o hs o 4 r27 fe iii oh h o fe iii o h 2 o in contrast sct significantly accelerates peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of gt much more apparent than that in the absence of gt the acceleration correlated with apparent dissolution of iron from gt as indicated by the time course profiles of dissolved iron concentrations fig s5 presumably due to chelation facilitated dissolution of fe iii from gt in comparison much milder dissolution of iron occurred in the pds gt system and the pds na4p2o7 gt system indicating less efficient acid facilitated dissolution of gt and inorganic chelation facilitated dissolution of gt respectively to further explore the influences of dissolved inorganic fe iii species and citrate chelated fe iii on peroxydisulfate decomposition peroxydisulfate decomposition trials in the presence of fe2 so4 3 and iron iii citrate were performed respectively as illustrated in fig s6 fe2 so4 3 showed only slight acceleration to peroxydisulfate decomposition presumably attributed to inefficient recycling of fe iii to fe ii species pham et al 2012 whereas iron iii citrate substantially accelerated peroxydisulfate decomposition the results further caution against the application of organic stabilizers with peroxydisulfate based isco in addition negligible dissolution of iron from gt was observed in the presence of na2sio3 na2sno3 and na3po4 as shown in fig s5 these oxyanions are known for their ability to precipitate dissolved fe iii species and block surface iron by complexation schumb 1957 wuorimaa et al 2006 as confirmed by sem eds fig s7 and fig s8 and ftir fig s9 analysis of gt samples e g the eds spectra of gt exposed to pds na3po4 fig s8 show apparent existence of phosphorus on the surface and the corresponding ftir spectra fig s9 show two new bands at 1040 and 1085 cm 1 which are attributed to the nonprotonated bidentate complex feo 2po2 tejedor tejedor and anderson 1990 the sequestering of iron by theses inorganic stabilizers can further minimize potential acceleration by dissolved transition metal species or their minerals desired for extending the longevity of peroxydisulfate for tap isco applications further tests were conducted to test their potential in stabilizing peroxydisulfate in the presence of soil particles and tentatively investigate the impact of soil matrix to the stabilization the data are shown in fig 3b compared with peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of gt the consumption of peroxydisulfate in the presence of soil particles was generally increased except in the pds sct soil system soil particles markedly increased initial peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of na2sio3 na2sno3 and na3po4 attributed to increased oxidant demand by dissolved organic carbon materials the dissolution of organic carbon materials from the soil particles was substantially increased under alkaline conditions as illustrated in fig s10 once the oxidant demand of the dissolved organic carbon materials was met stabilization of tap by inorganic stabilizers became apparent leading to much slower peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of inorganic stabilizers than that in the pds soil system on the other hand relatively milder peroxydisulfate decomposition occurred in the pds soil sct system than the pds gt sct system attributed to less apparent dissolution of fe iii from soil particles in the presence of sct than that from gt as illustrated in fig s10 in contrast very little iron dissolution occurred in the presence of inorganic stabilizers reconfirming their capability of iron sequestering 3 4 chemical probe experiments time course degradation profiles of an nb and hca were illustrated in fig 4 a fig 4b and fig 4c respectively loss of probes was negligible in the water only control system during the whole studied period the degradation of all three probes fits the pseudo first order kinetics and the apparent rate constants k obs an k obs nb and k obs hca are summarized in fig s11 an is utilized as a general chemical probe for the detection of oxidative radical species including so4 ho and other oxidative oxyanion radicals e g po4 2 cencione et al 1998 furman et al 2011 which can oxidize an as illustrated in fig 4a inorganic peroxide stabilizer can improve initial fluxes of oxidative radical species the k obs an value in the presence of na3po4 was about 32 2 times greater than that in the pds only system followed in decreasing orders by 28 5 13 4 and 1 7 times greater in the presence of na2sno3 na2sio3 and na4p2o7 respectively in contrast sct decreased the kobs an value by 60 attributed to competition of sct against an for so4 in the an pds system s2o8 2 may compete against an for so4 as k5 so4 s2o8 2 is close to ksulfate radical an so4 an under the conditions tested herein if so4 reacts with s2o8 2 the resulting s2o8 is a reductive species zhu et al 2018 not likely to oxidize an in the presence of inorganic stabilizers so4 tends to be converted into ho under alkaline conditions which has higher reactivity toward an than so4 in addition quenching of so4 ho will produce oxyanion radicals which unlike s2o8 are still oxidative enough to oxidize an rapidly e g po4 2 can oxidize an k 5 9 0 6 107 m 1 s 1 cencione et al 1998 these factors may contribute to the observed enhanced oxidation of an in the presence of inorganic stabilizers nb is generally utilized as a probe for ho khydroxyl radical nb 3 2 0 4 109 m 1 s 1 as it cannot react with so4 furman et al 2011 though inorganic stabilizers may compete with nb for ho to some extent inorganic stabilizers still improves the oxidation of nb as illustrated in fig 4b attributed to significantly enhanced conversion of so4 into ho under alkaline conditions over that under acidic conditions in the pds only system gao et al 2020 guan et al 2011 the kobs nb was 5 4 0 24 x 10 3 min 1 in the presence of na2sio3 followed in descending order by 4 1 0 15 x 10 3 min 1 in the presence of na3po4 3 5 0 14 x 10 3 min 1 in the presence of na2sno3 3 0 0 1 x 10 3 min 1 in the presence of na4p2o7 1 6 0 14 x 10 3 min 1 in the absence of stabilizers and 1 0 0 1 x 10 4 min 1 in the presence of sct in contrast slow conversion of so4 into ho under acidic conditions accounts much slower oxidation of nb in the pds only system whereas the competition of sct for available ho further inhibits the oxidation of nb in the presence of sct hca is utilized as a probe for reductive species such as o2 and s2o8 furman et al 2011 zhu et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 4c both inorganic stabilizers and sct decrease the fluxes of reductive species to some extent though hca can still be effectively reduced the apparent reduction rate constant k obs hca was 1 4 0 010 x 10 1 min 1 in the absence of stabilizers followed in descending order by 6 6 0 27 x 10 2 min 1 in the presence of na4p2o7 6 5 0 080 x 10 2 min 1 in the presence of na2sio3 5 3 0 24 x 10 2 min 1 in the presence of na3po4 4 4 0 15 x 10 2 min 1 in the presence of sct and 3 3 0 21 x 10 2 min 1 in the presence of na2sno3 in the pds only system the reaction between so4 and s2o8 2 generates s2o8 that can reduce hca zhu et al 2018 in contrast the competition of sct or inorganic stabilizers against s2o8 2 for so4 ho will suppresses the formation of s2o8 and consequently the reduction of hca alkyl radicals and o2 may be produced in the presence of sct and in the presence of inorganic stabilizes respectively which may contribute to the reduction of hca as well furman et al 2011 watts et al 2018 overall the results of the probe experiments indicate tap systems containing inorganic stabilizers have high oxidation reactivity toward refractory organic contaminants though the reduction reactivity toward organic contaminants recalcitrant to oxidation may be suppressed to some extent thus further studies primarily focus on investigating the potential of utilizing inorganic stabilizers to improve the efficacy of tap isco 3 5 oxidation of tce dnapl to evaluate potential benefits of inorganic stabilizer addition to tap isco oxidation of tce liquids in the presence of stabilizers was conducted under quiescent conditions to mimic subsurface isco conditions time course profiles of residual peroxydisulfate and tce are included in fig 5 peroxydisulfate decomposition and tce oxidation in the initial stage fitted the pseudo first order kinetics well and the kinetic rate constants are included in fig s12 as illustrated in fig 5a inorganic stabilizers can effectively enhance peroxydisulfate longevity even in the presence of tce liquids attractive for long term isco applications the k d was 8 8 0 051 x 10 2 d 1 in the absence of stabilizers followed in descending order by 8 2 0 40 x 10 2 d 1 in the presence of sct 4 0

days 90 peroxydisulfate was already consumed in the pds only system and the sct pds system in contrast 62 peroxydisulfate was consumed in the presence of na4p2o7 and less than 50 peroxydisulfate was consumed in the presence of na2sio3 na2sno3 or na3po4 tce loss was negligible in the water only control system during the whole studied period tce degradation fig 5b was significantly suppressed in the presence of sct attributed to competition of sct against tce for available so4 oxidation of tce was also hurdled in the presence of na2sio3 and na2sno3 accompanied by large amounts of precipitates settled at the tce water interface due to acid triggered hydrolysis lewis and walters 1960 pinkas 2005 which may hurdle the diffusion of peroxydisulfate from the bulk solutions to the interface and the dissolution and diffusion to tce to aqueous phase if applied in subsurface the precipitates will reduce soil permeability not desired for the injection and dispersion of peroxydisulfate in the subsurface as well this cautions against the application of na2sio3 and na2sno3 for the stabilization of peroxydisulfate in the subsurface isco applications in contrast the pds only system the pds na4p2o7 system and the pds na3po4 system did not suffer from the precipitation issue which explains more effective oxidation of tce in these three systems it is notable that accelerated peroxydisulfate decomposition in the pds only system did not achieve apparent improved oxidation of tce as the oxidation of tce liquids was expected to be primarily limited by the dissolution of tce into the aqueous phase acidification was also more apparent in the pds only system as illustrated by time course ph profiles fig s12 while acid catalyzed peroxydisulfate decomposition may generate weaker or ineffectual non radical oxidants such as hs2o8 so4 h2so5 and h2o2 kolthoff and miller 1951 in comparison peroxydisulfate decomposition was suppressed to the greatest extent in the presence of na3po4 while tce oxidation was improved achieving the greatest tce degradation at the end of three months as a result the oxidant utilization efficiency the amount of oxidized tce divided by the amount of oxidant consumed in the pds na3po4 system was higher than that in the pds only system improved oxidant utilization efficiency is attractive for isco applications which may reduce the amount of oxidant required to achieve the remedial target and offset the cost of inorganic stabilizers to some extent overall the identification of a suitable stabilizer in fulfillment of both increased peroxydisulfate longevity and improved tap oxidation demonstrates that the proposed stabilizer enhanced tap isco is feasible 4 conclusion this study indicates that compatible peroxide stabilizers can markedly enhance the lifetime of peroxydisulfate for the tap system while maintaining high oxidation reactivity toward refractory organic contaminants the addition of proper inorganic peroxide stabilizers can effectively suppress acid autocatalyzed decomposition of peroxydisulfate which is a primary contributor to peroxydisulfate decomposition under acidic conditions in addition inorganic stabilizers can act as radical quenchers and suppress peroxydisulfate decomposition through cyclic radical chain reactions they can also sequester transition metal cations and block the surface activation sites of transition metal minerals thus inhibiting peroxydisulfate decomposition catalyzed by subsurface transition metal species if applied in isco applications increased peroxydisulfate longevity and maintaining high residual peroxydisulfate concentration will improve the diffusion and dispersion of peroxydisulfate in the treatment zone and provide long term availability of reactive radical species for the remediation of soil sorbed hocs napls and organic contaminated groundwater results from tap oxidation of tce dnapl indicate the potential of suitable stabilizers e g na3po4 in improving tap isco remedial performance overall this study provides the fundamental basis for improving the efficacy of tap isco with inorganic peroxide stabilizers and valuable guidance for further optimization of stabilizer enhanced tap isco treatment in future lab studies and pilot tests in addition the impact of soil matrix to peroxydisulfate stabilization the environmental impact of the stabilizers and cost effectiveness of the stabilizer enhanced tap isco etc should be investigated in future studies as well declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15498,thermally activated peroxydisulfate in situ chemical oxidation tap isco is often applied for the remediation of soil sorbed hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs and nonaqueous phase liquids napls which act as long term sources of groundwater contamination tap isco benefits from improved desorption dissolution of organic contaminants into the aqueous phase and efficient activation of peroxydisulfate at elevated temperatures but the primary limitation of tap isco is the short lifetime of peroxydisulfate therefore the availability of reactive radical species to resolve this problem coupling of peroxide stabilizers with tap were tested the compatibility of seven representative commercial organic and inorganic peroxide stabilizers including sodium stannate trisodium phosphate sodium pyrophosphate sodium silicate sodium citrate ethylene diamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt with tap in aqueous solutions and solutions containing goethite or soil particles were first studied the effects of stabilizers on the formation distribution and reactivity of reactive oxygen species were then investigated through electron paramagnetic resonance epr spin trapping experiments using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide chemical probe experiments using anisole nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane and biphasic trichloroethylene tce dense nonaqueous phase liquids dnapls tap isco mimicking experiments the results indicate that organic stabilizers significantly accelerate peroxydisulfate decomposition at both ambient and elevated temperatures in contrast inorganic stabilizers can markedly increase peroxydisulfate longevity by suppressing the acid catalyzed peroxydisulfate decomposition quenching radical chain acceleration and sequestering transition metal species in addition tap systems containing inorganic stabilizers can effectively generate a variety of reactive radical species including so4 ho and o2 and improve the oxidation of anisole and nitrobenzene though suppressing the reduction of hexachloroethane to some extent especially suitable inorganic stabilizers e g trisodium phosphate can effectively improve tap oxidation of tce dnapl while suppressing peroxydisulfate decomposition overall this study provides the fundamental basis of coupling tap isco with peroxide stabilizers

last two decades to address soils and groundwater contaminated by organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons chlorinated solvents etc krembs et al 2010 siegrist et al 2011 tsitonaki et al 2010 upon activation of peroxydisulfate the generated reactive radical species e g sulfate radical and hydroxyl radical can rapidly oxidize organic contaminants dissolved in the aqueous phase but the oxidation of soil sorbed hydrophobic organic contaminants hocs and contaminants existed in nonaqueous phase liquids napls which often act as the long term sources of groundwater contamination is hurdled by the slow desorption dissolution of target contaminants into the aqueous phase krembs et al 2010 stroo et al 2012 teel et al 2009 to address this issue thermally activated peroxydisulfate isco tap isco is often employed as elevated temperatures can improve the desorption dissolution of organic contaminants as well as efficiently activating peroxydisulfate peng et al 2015 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2013 however the primary limitation of tap isco is the short lifetime of peroxydisulfate therefore the availability of reactive radical species at elevated temperatures e g t 1 2 is less than four days at 50 c in the subsurface johnson et al 2008 which would constrain the diffusion and dispersion of peroxydisulfate in the contaminated zones and impair the remedial performance the lifetime of peroxydisulfate in the subsurface during tap isco applications depends not only on the thermal homolysis of peroxydisulfate r1 but also on oxidant consumption by natural organic material nom and other reducible species potential accelerated decomposition by subsurface transition metal minerals e g fe mn species etc to meet the oxidant demands of organic contaminants nom and other naturally occurring reducible species in the subsurface high dosage of peroxydisulfate is generally injected added to the treatment zone in isco applications siegrist et al 2011 tsitonaki et al 2010

hydrolysis r2 can markedly accelerate peroxydisulfate decomposition kolthoff and miller 1951 additionally dissolved transition metal cations denoted as mn in the groundwater and subsurface minerals denoted as mn e g goethite may catalyze peroxydisulfate decomposition r3 and r4 liu et al 2014 in addition if residual peroxydisulfate is still present in high concentrations so4 ho may react with residual s2o8 2 which may initiate and propagate cyclic radical chain reactions r5 and r6 that can substantially accelerate peroxydisulfate decomposition house 1962 wang wu and deng 2020 zhu et al 2018 these side reactions may significantly reduce the lifetime of peroxydisulfate and the efficacy of tap isco however little attention has been paid to address these issues as peroxydisulfate is generally considered a stable oxidant with studies primarily focusing on its activation in isco applications tsitonaki et al 2010 r1 s 2 o 8 2 h e a t s o 4 s o 4 r2 2 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 o h 4 s o 4 2 o

2006 this study intended to improve the lifetime of peroxydisulfate and the efficacy of tap isco with peroxide stabilizers phosphate salts stannate salts etc are typical inorganic peroxide stabilizers while typical organic ones are oftentimes organic chelators such as citric acids salts aminocarboxylic acids salts and aminophosphonic acids salts in industry peroxide stabilizers are often added in commercial hydrogen peroxide products as well as in its applications to stabilize the highly reactive and unstable hydrogen peroxide by primarily acting as transition metal sequesters or radical scavengers to inhibit radical chain run off reactions induced by transition metal species croft et al 1992 wuorimaa et al 2006 as these two peroxide chemicals have similar chemical structures and chemical behaviors peroxide stabilizers theoretically may stabilize peroxydisulfate through similar mechanisms though whether they can suppress acid autocatalyzed peroxydisulfate decomposition or not requires further studies to the best of our knowledge the effects of stabilizers on the fate of peroxydisulfate under thermal activation conditions and tap isco efficacy has not been studied previously therefore a systematic screening of representative commercial peroxide stabilizers was carried out to identify promising ones that can enhance peroxydisulfate longevity at elevated temperatures in aqueous solutions promising stabilizers were then tested for their potential to stabilize peroxydisulfate in the presence of goethite a common subsurface mineral and a soil sample respectively the effects of stabilizers on the formation distribution and reactivity of reactive oxygen species were assessed through electron paramagnetic resonance epr spin trapping experiments using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and chemical probe experiments with anisole as a probe for so4 ho and other oxidative radical species nitrobenzene for ho and hexachloroethane for reductive radical species teel et al 2011 finally the effects of stabilizers on the efficacy of tap isco were tentatively investigated through tap oxidation of trichloroethylene tce dnapl under quiescent conditions tce dnapls are frequently present in chlorinated solvent contaminated sites and tend to slowly but continuously dissolve into surrounding groundwater for decades and even longer henry et al

chemicals were all of analytical grade or better and used as received further information about the stabilizers including their chemical structures is provided in table s1 goethite was synthesized and characterized according to literature procedures pham et al 2012 soil sample tested was collected from an uncontaminated site of our campus treated and characterized as in our previous study wang et al 2014 the dried soil has a ph of 4 96 an organic content of 1 12 wt and an iron content of 3 0 wt 2 2 compatibility of stabilizers with peroxydisulfate in aqueous solutions twenty ml of freshly prepared solutions containing 10 0 g l of individual peroxide stabilizers and 50 0 g l pds were put into 40 ml epa voa vials with ptfe silicone septa caps tests were conducted in temperature controlled shakers at 20 c ambient temperature and 40 c pds activation temperature respectively with continuous shaking at 150 rpm the initial pds dosage and the activation temperature selected was within the ranges of oxidant dosage and activation temperature often applied in isco field applications siegrist et al 2011 tsitonaki et al 2010 the dosage of stabilizers utilized was based on the results of examining the effects of the concentration of na3po4 the most promising stabilizers out of the preliminary screening study on peroxydisulfate decomposition at designated intervals residual peroxydisulfate concentrations and phs of the solutions were determined according to literature procedures wang et al 2017 blank controls with only pds were also run under similar conditions all experiments herein and thereafter were conducted at least in triplicate 2 3 compatibility of stabilizers with peroxydisulfate in the presence of goethite or soil particles further studies were primarily conducted with inorganic stabilizers promising stabilizers out of the above screening studies pds only controls experiments and comparative experiments with sct the organic stabilizer with relatively mild acceleration to peroxydisulfate decomposition were also conducted under similar conditions experiments were conducted at 40 c to examine the potential of stabilizers in stabilizing peroxydisulfate in the presence of goethite and soil particles respectively goethite 0 2 g or soil sample 5 0 g was first added into the vials and following experimental procedures were basically the same as the ones in the above screening experiments at desired time intervals samples were taken out and immediately put into ice water baths the upper aqueous solutions were utilized for the measurement of phs residual peroxydisulfate concentration and dissolved iron concentration cantera et al 2002 toc wu et al 2022 was also monitored if soil present goethite samples remained in the bottom were collected and washed with di water followed by oven drying at 60 c thereafter sem eds pham et al 2012 and ftir analysis yan and jing 2018 of the dried samples were conducted 2 4 probe experiments aqueous solutions of anisole nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane were prepared by dissolving the pure chemicals in di water according to literature procedures teel et al 2011 ten ml of individual probe solution and 10 0 ml of solution containing individual stabilizers 20 0 g l and pds 100 0 g l were added into 40 ml epa voa vials after gentle mixing the capped vials were shaken at 150 rpm at 40 c at designed time intervals samples were taken out and immediately put into ice water baths to quench the oxidation thereafter 5 0 ml of aqueous solution was extracted with 5 0 ml of hexanes the concentrations of residual anisole or nitrobenzene in the extracted hexane solutions were quantified by gc fid while residual hexachloroethane was quantified by gc ecd ahmad et al 2010 teel et al 2011 2 5 electron paramagnetic resonance epr studies epr trapping experiments with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo were conducted to characterize the formation of so4 ho o2 and other radical species formed in the 24 h samples of the aqueous screening experiments individual samples were first immediately put into aqueous dmpo solutions followed by epr analysis of the dmpo adducts wang wu and deng 2020 trapping experiments were also conducted with dmpo dissolved in dmso wang wu and deng 2020 and dmpo dissolved in methanol wang et al 2018 for improved trapping and characterization of so4 and o2 respectively 2 6 oxidation of tce dnapls five ml of di water was first added to a 40 ml conical centrifuge tube followed by the addition of 100 0 μl of tce liquids beneath the water surface with a syringe then 15 0 ml of solutions containing individual stabilizers and pds were added and the samples were sealed with screw ptff silicone septa caps initial concentrations of individual stabilizer and pds in the upper aqueous solutions were 10 0 g l and 50 0 g l respectively to mimic field isco conditions the samples were maintained at 40 c under quiescent conditions without stirring or shaking control experiments with only pds and those with only pure water were also run under similar conditions at designed time intervals the samples were taken out and immediately put into ice water baths to quench the oxidation of tce residual peroxydisulfate concentrations and phs of the upper solutions were measured residual tce in the upper aqueous phase and the bottom organic phase was extracted with hexanes and quantified by gc fid respectively peng et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 compatibility of peroxydisulfate with representative peroxide stabilizers in aqueous solutions time course peroxydisulfate decomposition profiles of pds at 20 c and 40 c in the presence of peroxide stabilizers were shown in fig 1 a 1d initial pds decomposition under all conditions follows the pseudo first order kinetics very well the initial pds decomposition apparent rate constants k d were summarized in fig s1 the kd values at 20 c and 40 c for the pds only system are 5 4 0 93 x 10 3 and 3 6 0 24 x 10 2 d 1 respectively which agree with reported literature values johnson et al 2008 kolthoff and miller 1951 organic stabilizers increase the k d values by 1 7 6 times at 20 c and by 0 5 3 3 times at 40 c in contrast inorganic stabilizers decrease the k d values by 50 consistently at both 20 c and 40 c the results indicate that organic peroxide stabilizers accelerate peroxydisulfate decomposition both at ambient temperature and elevated temperature whereas inorganic stabilizers can effectively suppress peroxydisulfate decomposition accelerated peroxydisulfate decomposition by organic stabilizers may be attributed to cyclic radical chain reactions initiated by the reaction between so4 and organic stabilizers kolthoff and miller 1951 wang wu and deng 2020 these organic stabilizers contain tertiary amine moiety si et al 1995 carboxylic acid moiety criquet et al 2010 madhavan et al 1978 or secondary c h bonds huie and clifton 1989 that readily react with so4 r7 r11 the electron transfer reaction between the amnio group of edta 2na or edtmp and so4 r7 will produce an amino cation radical intermediate that is prone to rearrange and form an alkyl radical as the intermediate r8 the reaction between the carboxylic group of edta 2na or sct and so4 r9 will produce a carboxylic radical that is prone to decarboxylation r10 with an alkyl radical formed as the intermediate in addition so4 can react with all three organic stabilizers through hydrogen abstraction of the secondary c h bonds r11 producing an alkyl radical as the intermediate as well alkyl radicals are known to react rapidly with s2o8 2 r12 leading to peroxydisulfate decomposition and regeneration of another so4 beylerian and khachatrian 1984 as a result organic stabilizers can propagate cyclic radical chain reactions r13 that may markedly accelerate peroxydisulfate decomposition acceleration by cyclic radical chain reactions may also occur in the pds only system but such acceleration is expected to be much milder as s2o8 2 is significantly less reactive toward so4 than the organic stabilizers e g k5 k11 wang wu and deng 2020 r7 r8 r9 s o 4

stabilizers were present initial solution phs were in the alkaline range so4 is prone to convert into ho r14 under alkaline conditions gao et al 2020 guan et al 2011 in the presence of inorganic peroxide stabilizers the stabilizer derived oxyanions may quench both so4 and ho and suppress their acceleration through the cyclic radical chain reactions to some extent neta et al 1988 for example ho the dominant radical species at high ph conditions e g ph 12 reacts much more rapid with po4 3 than s2o8 2 r15 and r16 k15 po4 3 k16 s2o8 2 neta et al 1988 and the generated oxyanion radical po4 2 is less reactive and less likely to react with s2o8 2 than ho thus minimizing acceleration through radical chain reactions under less alkaline conditions e g ph 12 due to acidification by peroxydisulfate decomposition the conversion of so4 into ho is suppressed while po4 3 tends to convert into hpo4 2 the reaction between hpo4 2 and so4 r17 will produce hpo4 neta et al 1988 which is less reactive and less likely to react with s2o8 2 than so4 r14 s o 4 o h s o 4 2 o h k 14 6 5 x 1 0 7 m 1 s 1 r15 h o p o 4 3 h o p o 4 2 k 15 1 1 x 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 r16 s 2 o 8 2 h o s 2 o 8 o h k 16 1

by the time course ph profiles fig s2 the estimated acid catalyzed decomposition rate constant at 40 c is 1 12 h m 1d 1 according to literature report johnson et al 2008 under the conditions herein acid autocatalyzed peroxydisulfate decomposition r2 will become a primary contributor to peroxydisulfate decomposition if solution phs are less than 2 in contrast inorganic stabilizers can mitigate the acidification issue and peroxydisulfate decomposition catalyzed by acids attributed to initial alkaline conditions slower production of protons as a byproduct of peroxydisulfate decomposition and their ability to absorb the protons e g r18 to further explore the impact of acidification to peroxydisulfate decomposition peroxydisulfate decomposition experiments at 40 c in the presence of 0 05 m h2so4 and 0 1 m naoh were conducted respectively as shown in fig s1 the kd value obtained in the presence of h2so4 is about 3 times greater than that of the pds only system whereas the k d value obtained in the presence of naoh is much lower than that of the pds only system the results clearly demonstrate significant acceleration by acid autocatalyzed decomposition r18 p o 4 3 h h p o 4 2 3 2 epr studies as illustrated in fig 2 a and fig s3 dmpo oh signal was dominant in all systems when the dmpo trapping experiments were carried out in aqueous solutions whereas the signals of dmpo so4 dmpo o2 ho2 etc were insignificant relatively speaking the intensity of dmpo oh was strongest in the pds only system the intensities of dmpo oh in the presence of organic stabilizers were slightly lower than that of the pds only system in contrast the intensities of dmpo oh in the presence of inorganic stabilizers were much lower than that of the pds only system however as dmpo oh may be derived from rapid decomposition of dmpo adducts of other reactive oxygen species e g so4 s2o8 o2 finkelstein et al 1982 timmins et al 1999 zhu et al 2018 the intensity of dmpo oh in individual systems cannot infer the presence of ho or its relative steady state concentrations ho ss to improve the characterization of so4 dmpo trapping experiments were then conducted in dmso solutions as the stability of dmpo so4 can be significantly increased in dmso solutions zalibera et al 2009 as illustrated in fig 2b and fig s3 the intensities of dmpo so4 signal in the presence of stabilizers were all lower than that of the pds only system in the pds only system so4 is expected to be primarily quenched by s2o8 2 wang wu and deng 2020 leading to the formation of s2o8 s2o8 may be trapped by dmpo but dmpo s2o8 is not stable prone to decay into to dmpo so4 and a so4 subsequently trapped by dmpo and contributing to the formation of dmpo so4 zhu et al 2018 the relative lower steady state concentrations of so4 so4 ss in the presence of inorganic stabilizers may be attributed to enhanced conversion of so4 into ho under alkaline conditions and quenching of so4 ho and the radical chain reactions by the stabilizers on the other hand the highly reactive organic stabilizers may compete against s2o8 2 and dmpo for available so4 thus suppressing the formation of dmpo so4 in systems containing organic stabilizers trapping of o2 ho2 was conducted in methanol solutions to increase the stability of dmpo o2 ho2 as well as suppressing potential oxidation of o2 ho2 by so4 ho wang et al 2018 protonation of o2 can form ho2 which has a pka of 4 8 as illustrated in fig 2c dmpo o2 ho2 signals were observed in all systems under alkaline conditions base catalyzed hydrolysis of peroxydisulfate r19 forms hydrogen peroxide anion which will be readily oxidized by peroxydisulfate to form so4 and o2 r20 furman et al 2010 under acidic conditions h2o2 may be formed from acid catalyzed hydrolysis of peroxydisulfate r21 r24 kolthoff and miller 1951 subsequent oxidation of h2o2 by so4 r25 leads to the formation of ho2 wei et al 2017 r19 s 2 o 8 2 3 o h h o 2 2 s o 4 2 h 2 o

concentrations of the oxyanion radicals their slow reaction with dmpo or instability of their dmpo adducts it is known that the epr spectra of the dmpo adducts of many oxyanion radicals e g carbonate radical and phosphate radical etc are difficult to obtain kochany and lipczynska kochany 1992 wang and wang 2020 in addition epr signals of dmpo adducts of alkyl radicals intermediates from the oxidation of organic stabilizers by so4 was not observed alkyl radicals are highly reactive toward residual peroxydisulfate which minimizes their accumulation beylerian and khachatrian 1984 3 3 stabilization of peroxydisulfate at elevated temperature in the presence of goethite and soil particles to investigate potential impact of subsurface minerals which can activate peroxydisulfate to the stabilization of peroxydisulfate by the stabilizers time course monitoring of peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of goethite gt were conducted the results are shown in fig 3 a initial peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of gt also fits the pseudo first order kinetics wells as in the homogenous aqueous systems and the kd values are included in fig s4 the kd values for systems containing inorganic stabilizers 0 0093 0 0118 d 1 are much smaller than that of the pds gt system 2 9 0 18 x 10 2 d 1 whereas sct markedly increases the k d value to 5 1 0 34 x 10 2 d 1 the results clearly indicate that inorganic stabilizers are effective at stabilizing peroxydisulfate even in the presence of gt notably the kd values in the pds gt system and gt systems containing inorganic stabilizes are consistently smaller than their corresponding kd values obtained under similar conditions in the aqueous systems without gt present the results indicate gt may suppress peroxydisulfate decomposition to some extent some literature studies have similar observation that metal hydro oxide minerals including iron oxides may suppress peroxydisulfate decomposition attributed to surface scavenging of so4 ho by the minerals e g r26 and r27 crincoli et al 2020 teel et al 2011 though gt may also activate peroxydisulfate to some extent as reported in literature ding et al 2020 such activation will be less important at elevated temperature due to efficient thermal activation r26 fe iii oh s o 4 fe iii o hs o 4 r27 fe iii oh h o fe iii o h 2 o in contrast sct significantly accelerates peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of gt much more apparent than that in the absence of gt the acceleration correlated with apparent dissolution of iron from gt as indicated by the time course profiles of dissolved iron concentrations fig s5 presumably due to chelation facilitated dissolution of fe iii from gt in comparison much milder dissolution of iron occurred in the pds gt system and the pds na4p2o7 gt system indicating less efficient acid facilitated dissolution of gt and inorganic chelation facilitated dissolution of gt respectively to further explore the influences of dissolved inorganic fe iii species and citrate chelated fe iii on peroxydisulfate decomposition peroxydisulfate decomposition trials in the presence of fe2 so4 3 and iron iii citrate were performed respectively as illustrated in fig s6 fe2 so4 3 showed only slight acceleration to peroxydisulfate decomposition presumably attributed to inefficient recycling of fe iii to fe ii species pham et al 2012 whereas iron iii citrate substantially accelerated peroxydisulfate decomposition the results further caution against the application of organic stabilizers with peroxydisulfate based isco in addition negligible dissolution of iron from gt was observed in the presence of na2sio3 na2sno3 and na3po4 as shown in fig s5 these oxyanions are known for their ability to precipitate dissolved fe iii species and block surface iron by complexation schumb 1957 wuorimaa et al 2006 as confirmed by sem eds fig s7 and fig s8 and ftir fig s9 analysis of gt samples e g the eds spectra of gt exposed to pds na3po4 fig s8 show apparent existence of phosphorus on the surface and the corresponding ftir spectra fig s9 show two new bands at 1040 and 1085 cm 1 which are attributed to the nonprotonated bidentate complex feo 2po2 tejedor tejedor and anderson 1990 the sequestering of iron by theses inorganic stabilizers can further minimize potential acceleration by dissolved transition metal species or their minerals desired for extending the longevity of peroxydisulfate for tap isco applications further tests were conducted to test their potential in stabilizing peroxydisulfate in the presence of soil particles and tentatively investigate the impact of soil matrix to the stabilization the data are shown in fig 3b compared with peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of gt the consumption of peroxydisulfate in the presence of soil particles was generally increased except in the pds sct soil system soil particles markedly increased initial peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of na2sio3 na2sno3 and na3po4 attributed to increased oxidant demand by dissolved organic carbon materials the dissolution of organic carbon materials from the soil particles was substantially increased under alkaline conditions as illustrated in fig s10 once the oxidant demand of the dissolved organic carbon materials was met stabilization of tap by inorganic stabilizers became apparent leading to much slower peroxydisulfate decomposition in the presence of inorganic stabilizers than that in the pds soil system on the other hand relatively milder peroxydisulfate decomposition occurred in the pds soil sct system than the pds gt sct system attributed to less apparent dissolution of fe iii from soil particles in the presence of sct than that from gt as illustrated in fig s10 in contrast very little iron dissolution occurred in the presence of inorganic stabilizers reconfirming their capability of iron sequestering 3 4 chemical probe experiments time course degradation profiles of an nb and hca were illustrated in fig 4 a fig 4b and fig 4c respectively loss of probes was negligible in the water only control system during the whole studied period the degradation of all three probes fits the pseudo first order kinetics and the apparent rate constants k obs an k obs nb and k obs hca are summarized in fig s11 an is utilized as a general chemical probe for the detection of oxidative radical species including so4 ho and other oxidative oxyanion radicals e g po4 2 cencione et al 1998 furman et al 2011 which can oxidize an as illustrated in fig 4a inorganic peroxide stabilizer can improve initial fluxes of oxidative radical species the k obs an value in the presence of na3po4 was about 32 2 times greater than that in the pds only system followed in decreasing orders by 28 5 13 4 and 1 7 times greater in the presence of na2sno3 na2sio3 and na4p2o7 respectively in contrast sct decreased the kobs an value by 60 attributed to competition of sct against an for so4 in the an pds system s2o8 2 may compete against an for so4 as k5 so4 s2o8 2 is close to ksulfate radical an so4 an under the conditions tested herein if so4 reacts with s2o8 2 the resulting s2o8 is a reductive species zhu et al 2018 not likely to oxidize an in the presence of inorganic stabilizers so4 tends to be converted into ho under alkaline conditions which has higher reactivity toward an than so4 in addition quenching of so4 ho will produce oxyanion radicals which unlike s2o8 are still oxidative enough to oxidize an rapidly e g po4 2 can oxidize an k 5 9 0 6 107 m 1 s 1 cencione et al 1998 these factors may contribute to the observed enhanced oxidation of an in the presence of inorganic stabilizers nb is generally utilized as a probe for ho khydroxyl radical nb 3 2 0 4 109 m 1 s 1 as it cannot react with so4 furman et al 2011 though inorganic stabilizers may compete with nb for ho to some extent inorganic stabilizers still improves the oxidation of nb as illustrated in fig 4b attributed to significantly enhanced conversion of so4 into ho under alkaline conditions over that under acidic conditions in the pds only system gao et al 2020 guan et al 2011 the kobs nb was 5 4 0 24 x 10 3 min 1 in the presence of na2sio3 followed in descending order by 4 1 0 15 x 10 3 min 1 in the presence of na3po4 3 5 0 14 x 10 3 min 1 in the presence of na2sno3 3 0 0 1 x 10 3 min 1 in the presence of na4p2o7 1 6 0 14 x 10 3 min 1 in the absence of stabilizers and 1 0 0 1 x 10 4 min 1 in the presence of sct in contrast slow conversion of so4 into ho under acidic conditions accounts much slower oxidation of nb in the pds only system whereas the competition of sct for available ho further inhibits the oxidation of nb in the presence of sct hca is utilized as a probe for reductive species such as o2 and s2o8 furman et al 2011 zhu et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 4c both inorganic stabilizers and sct decrease the fluxes of reductive species to some extent though hca can still be effectively reduced the apparent reduction rate constant k obs hca was 1 4 0 010 x 10 1 min 1 in the absence of stabilizers followed in descending order by 6 6 0 27 x 10 2 min 1 in the presence of na4p2o7 6 5 0 080 x 10 2 min 1 in the presence of na2sio3 5 3 0 24 x 10 2 min 1 in the presence of na3po4 4 4 0 15 x 10 2 min 1 in the presence of sct and 3 3 0 21 x 10 2 min 1 in the presence of na2sno3 in the pds only system the reaction between so4 and s2o8 2 generates s2o8 that can reduce hca zhu et al 2018 in contrast the competition of sct or inorganic stabilizers against s2o8 2 for so4 ho will suppresses the formation of s2o8 and consequently the reduction of hca alkyl radicals and o2 may be produced in the presence of sct and in the presence of inorganic stabilizes respectively which may contribute to the reduction of hca as well furman et al 2011 watts et al 2018 overall the results of the probe experiments indicate tap systems containing inorganic stabilizers have high oxidation reactivity toward refractory organic contaminants though the reduction reactivity toward organic contaminants recalcitrant to oxidation may be suppressed to some extent thus further studies primarily focus on investigating the potential of utilizing inorganic stabilizers to improve the efficacy of tap isco 3 5 oxidation of tce dnapl to evaluate potential benefits of inorganic stabilizer addition to tap isco oxidation of tce liquids in the presence of stabilizers was conducted under quiescent conditions to mimic subsurface isco conditions time course profiles of residual peroxydisulfate and tce are included in fig 5 peroxydisulfate decomposition and tce oxidation in the initial stage fitted the pseudo first order kinetics well and the kinetic rate constants are included in fig s12 as illustrated in fig 5a inorganic stabilizers can effectively enhance peroxydisulfate longevity even in the presence of tce liquids attractive for long term isco applications the k d was 8 8 0 051 x 10 2 d 1 in the absence of stabilizers followed in descending order by 8 2 0 40 x 10 2 d 1 in the presence of sct 4 0 0 055 x 10 2 d 1 in the presence of na2sno3 4 0 0 097 x 10 2 d 1 in the presence of na4p2o7 2 1 0 021 x 10 2 d 1 in the presence of na2sio3 and 1 9 0 050 x 10 2 d 1 in the presence of na3po4 after 28 days 90 peroxydisulfate was already consumed in the pds only system and the sct pds system in contrast 62 peroxydisulfate was consumed in the presence of na4p2o7 and less than 50 peroxydisulfate was consumed in the presence of na2sio3 na2sno3 or na3po4 tce loss was negligible in the water only control system during the whole studied period tce degradation fig 5b was significantly suppressed in the presence of sct attributed to competition of sct against tce for available so4 oxidation of tce was also hurdled in the presence of na2sio3 and na2sno3 accompanied by large amounts of precipitates settled at the tce water interface due to acid triggered hydrolysis lewis and walters 1960 pinkas 2005 which may hurdle the diffusion of peroxydisulfate from the bulk solutions to the interface and the dissolution and diffusion to tce to aqueous phase if applied in subsurface the precipitates will reduce soil permeability not desired for the injection and dispersion of peroxydisulfate in the subsurface as well this cautions against the application of na2sio3 and na2sno3 for the stabilization of peroxydisulfate in the subsurface isco applications in contrast the pds only system the pds na4p2o7 system and the pds na3po4 system did not suffer from the precipitation issue which explains more effective oxidation of tce in these three systems it is notable that accelerated peroxydisulfate decomposition in the pds only system did not achieve apparent improved oxidation of tce as the oxidation of tce liquids was expected to be primarily limited by the dissolution of tce into the aqueous phase acidification was also more apparent in the pds only system as illustrated by time course ph profiles fig s12 while acid catalyzed peroxydisulfate decomposition may generate weaker or ineffectual non radical oxidants such as hs2o8 so4 h2so5 and h2o2 kolthoff and miller 1951 in comparison peroxydisulfate decomposition was suppressed to the greatest extent in the presence of na3po4 while tce oxidation was improved achieving the greatest tce degradation at the end of three months as a result the oxidant utilization efficiency the amount of oxidized tce divided by the amount of oxidant consumed in the pds na3po4 system was higher than that in the pds only system improved oxidant utilization efficiency is attractive for isco applications which may reduce the amount of oxidant required to achieve the remedial target and offset the cost of inorganic stabilizers to some extent overall the identification of a suitable stabilizer in fulfillment of both increased peroxydisulfate longevity and improved tap oxidation demonstrates that the proposed stabilizer enhanced tap isco is feasible 4 conclusion this study indicates that compatible peroxide stabilizers can markedly enhance the lifetime of peroxydisulfate for the tap system while maintaining high oxidation reactivity toward refractory organic contaminants the addition of proper inorganic peroxide stabilizers can effectively suppress acid autocatalyzed decomposition of peroxydisulfate which is a primary contributor to peroxydisulfate decomposition under acidic conditions in addition inorganic stabilizers can act as radical quenchers and suppress peroxydisulfate decomposition through cyclic radical chain reactions they can also sequester transition metal cations and block the surface activation sites of transition metal minerals thus inhibiting peroxydisulfate decomposition catalyzed by subsurface transition metal species if applied in isco applications increased peroxydisulfate longevity and maintaining high residual peroxydisulfate concentration will improve the diffusion and dispersion of peroxydisulfate in the treatment zone and provide long term availability of reactive radical species for the remediation of soil sorbed hocs napls and organic contaminated groundwater results from tap oxidation of tce dnapl indicate the potential of suitable stabilizers e g na3po4 in improving tap isco remedial performance overall this study provides the fundamental basis for improving the efficacy of tap isco with inorganic peroxide stabilizers and valuable guidance for further optimization of stabilizer enhanced tap isco treatment in future lab studies and pilot tests in addition the impact of soil matrix to peroxydisulfate stabilization the environmental impact of the stabilizers and cost effectiveness of the stabilizer enhanced tap isco etc should be investigated in future studies as well declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

15499,the ubiquitous microplastics in wastewater have raised growing concerns due to their unintended effects on microbial activities however whether and how microplastics affect nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas turnovers in mainstream biological nitrogen removal bnr process remain unclear this work therefore aimed to fill such knowledge gap by conducting both long term and batch tests after over 100 days of feeding with wastewater containing polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics 0 500 μg l the long term results showed that both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification were reduced as well as the n2o production during nitrification accordingly 60 reduction in n2o accumulation and 70 reduction in n2o production were observed in the denitrification and nitrification batch tests respectively nevertheless the long term n2o emission factors under pet microplastics stress were comparable to that in the control reactor mainly because pet microplastics led to more nitrite accumulation in anoxic period with the aid of online n2o sensors and site preference analysis it was demonstrated that the heterotrophic bacteria pathway and ammonia oxidizing bacteria denitrification pathway for n2o production were negatively affected by pet microplastics whereas a clear increase in the contribution of hydroxylamine pathway 22 9 was observed further investigation revealed that pet microplastics even at environmental level i e 10 μg l significantly reshaped the bnr sludge characteristics e g much larger particle size and microbial communities e g thauera rhodobacte and nitrospira as well as the nitrogen metabolism pathways which were chiefly responsible for the changes of n2o turnovers and n2o production pathways under the pet microplastics stress graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics nitrous oxide site preference turnover biological nitrogen removal polyethylene terephthalate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the massive usage but poor management of plastics plastic pollution especially microplastics have become one of the most severe environmental problems posing threat to many organisms and human beings okoffo et al 2021 thomas 2022 microplastics were first proposed in 2004 and defined as synthetic polymers smaller than 5 mm thompson et al 2004 so far microplastics have been ubiquitously found in water bodies soil environments and living organisms even in human blood sharma et al 2021 leslie et al 2022 the direct release of manufactured microbeads commonly applied in personal care and cosmetic products ppcps and fragmentation of large plastics because of sunlight irradiation physical wear biochemical degradation and etc are the main sources of primary and secondary microplastics respectively shahul hamid et al 2018 zurier and goddard 2021 rauert et al 2022 as one of the emerging pollutants microplastics have raised wide public and scientific concerns mai et al 2019 liu et al 2021 he et al 2022 studies have found that microplastics not only contain harmful additives added during production processes such as heavy metals phthalates and dibutyl phthalate but also effectively adsorb persistent organic pollutants benefiting from their hydrophobicity and considerable specific surface areas forming wandering contaminant composites zhang et al 2020 in addition microplastics are easily ingested by various organisms such as zooplankton taxa fish and seabirds derraik 2002 cole et al 2013 these ingested microplastics and the associated toxins may bioaccumulate in living organisms and biomagnify up the food chain yoon et al 2021 therefore the widespread microplastics readily interacts with organisms and even affects the ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles wastewater treatment plants wwtps are generally identified as a sink of various contaminants including microplastics wei et al 2019 the fate and detection of microplastics in wwtps have been well revealed sun et al 2019 although the microplastics concentration in the inlet wastewater was reported to vary from 61 to 1189 μg l and 98 3 of them were removed by the activated sludge system simon et al 2018 whether and how the long term exposure to microplastics affects wastewater treatment process particularly mainstream biological nitrogen removal bnr needs further investigation bnr process generally involves nitrification which occurs by nitrifying bacteria in the aerobic phase oxidizing ammonium nh 4 to nitrate no 3 with nitrite no 2 as intermediate and denitrification which occurs by denitrifying bacteria in the anoxic phase reducing no 3 to dinitrogen n2 step by step notably the nitrous oxide n2o emission from bnr process has been a global concern due to its potent greenhouse effect over 250 times than that of co2 and ozone depleting property duan et al 2021 as an inevitable byproduct n2o is mainly generated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob via hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation and aob denitrification pathway poth and focht 1985 and it is also an intermediate during denitrification firestone et al 1979 these interlaced biochemical processes are highly susceptible to external factors ultimately altering the nitrogen metabolism including n2o turnovers i e production and reduction of n2o for example a series of comparative studies indicated the sudden addition of microplastics e g polyvinylchloride pvc and polyether sulfone pes showed negative effects on ammonium oxidation but positive effects on denitrification li et al 2020 however knowledge of microplastics affecting the nitrogen metabolism in activated sludge is still limited qin et al 2020 reported that the 30 day exposure to pes microplastics 0 1 0 5 g l reduced nh 4 removal efficiency but showed no evident effect on tn removal for aerobic granular sludge ags zhou et al 2022 have proved that polystyrene ps microplastics 100 μm with low or high concentrations 10 or 1000 μg l showed little effects on tn removal of the anoxic aerobic bnr system within 40 days while high level 1000 μg l of ps nanoplastics 100 nm exhibited greatly negative impacts moreover the microbial community was significantly reshaped by microplastics leading to changes in bnr performance despite these interesting findings there is no systematic study on the long term effects of microplastics on each nitrogen metabolism step during mainstream bnr process and indeed whether microplastics affect n2o turnovers and the underlying mechanisms are largely unexplored all of these are critical for the overall understanding of the impacts of microplastics on bnr process and even biogeochemical cycle thus the objective of this work is to reveal the long term effects of entering microplastics in wastewater on n2o turnovers in mainstream bnr process polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics are commonly detected in influent of wwtps due to the widespread utilization of pet in synthetic clothes sun et al 2019 some previous studies have only revealed the impacts of pet microplastics on anaerobic granular sludge and anaerobic digestion process zhang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 thus it was used as the model microplastics in this study after over 100 day exposure to different concentrations of pet microplastics 0 10 100 and 500 μg l in different sequencing batch reactors sbrs a series of sbr cycle and batch tests were carried out to examine the production and reduction of n2o during denitrification and nitrification processes in particular the individual contributions of nh2oh oxidation and aob denitrification pathways to nitrification process were determined based on site preference sp measurements furthermore the variations of microbial community and nitrogen metabolism pathways under long term pet microplastics stress were also analyzed the findings of this work might provide a first insight and a comprehensive understanding of n2o turnovers under pet microplastics stress in mainstream bnr process 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of pet microplastics and synthetic wastewater the pet microplastics were obtained from huachuang co ltd dongguan china which had an average size of 80 μm to simulate their contents in the actual wastewater 15 μg l and predictive growing concentrations in the future yang et al 2020 three experimental reactors feeding with different concentrations of pet microplastics 10 100 and 500 μg l and a control reactor pet 0 μg l were operated in this work the pet microplastics stock solution was diluted to different exposure concentrations in the synthetic wastewater after 60 s of ultrasonic treatment wei et al 2021 the simulated wastewater was synthesized as follow per liter 191 07 mg of nh4cl 212 26 mg of glucose c6h12o 96 15 mg of ch3coona 540 00 mg of nahco3 67 74 mg of k2hpo4 h2o 15 12 mg of mgso4 10 25 mg of cacl2 and 0 6 ml of trace element solution text s1 therefore the resulting influent contained 300 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod and 50 mg n l nh 4 mimicking the typical wastewater for mainstream bnr zhou et al 2022 2 2 reactor setup and operation four replicate 10 l sbrs were conducted in a temperature controlled 22 1 c room away from sunlight each reactor has a cycle time of 360 min consisting of 6 min feeding 90 min anoxic period 220 min aerobic period 1 min sludge wasting 39 min settling 3 min decanting and 1 min idle period 2 5 l of synthetic wastewater was fed per cycle achieving a hydraulic retention time of 24 h according to the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations of effluent and wasting sludge the solids retention time were estimated to be 20 days a minichem do2 and a ph probe were used for the online continuous monitoring of dissolved oxygen do and ph of each reactor throughout the aerobic phase do was maintained in the range of 1 3 1 7 mg o2 l using an on off control system the aeration would be automatically turned on when do was below 1 3 mg o2 l once do exceeded 1 7 mg o2 l the aeration would be automatically turned off ph was not controlled and results showed that it varied between 7 35 and 7 65 the above operation processes for each reactor were automatically carried out by a programmable logic controller plc after about 60 days operation stable bnr performances effluent concentrations 0 1 0 1 mg nh 4 n l 20 6 1 8 mg no 3 n l and 0 1 0 1 mg no 2 n l were achieved for all reactors all the sludge was withdrawn and mixed and then equally shared among four reactors for the pet exposure experiments synthetic wastewater containing additional 10 100 and 500 μg l pet microplastics were prepared for the three experimental reactors see details in section 2 1 except different concentrations of pet microplastics in the feeding wastewater other conditions and operations were the same as before the initial concentrations of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and mlss in each reactor were about 1720 18 and 2000 30 mg l respectively the control and experimental reactors under different concentrations of pet microplastics stress have been running continuously for more than 100 days for cyclic studies the samples were obtained on day 105 110 and 115 every 30 min during one 6 h cycle for the measurements of nh 4 no 3 and no 2 the operation process was the same as that of parent reactor which was automatically controlled by a plc a n2o analyzer was used to determine n2o emission section 2 3 2 2 3 batch experiments after over 100 day exposure to pet microplastics the mixed liquor was obtained from parent reactors at the end of aerobic period to carry out batch tests in the designed sealable reactors for examining both denitrification and nitrification activities throughout each batch test the mixed liquor was under magnetic stirring and ph was maintained at 7 50 0 15 almost same as that in parent reactors by automatically adding hcl 1 m or nahco3 1 m with the aid of plc mlvss concentration in the batch reactor was measured in triplicate for each batch test 2 3 1 denitrification batch tests to explore the effects of pet microplastics on n2o turnovers during denitrification two types of batch tests were designed for the complete removal of residual nutrients i e external carbon source and inorganic nitrogen 500 ml of mixed liquor from the parent reactor was centrifuged 6000 rpm for 6 min and washed with tap water for three times before being resuspended to 500 ml in a 550 ml batch reactor there is no headspace in the batch reactor after immobilizing probes for the detection of do ph and dissolved n2o n2 gas was sparged until do dropped below 0 1 mg o2 l forming anoxic condition for the subsequent denitrification test a microsensor was used to continuously monitor the n2o concentration in liquid phase online 2 3 1 1 denitrification batch test 1 to assess the maximum specific reduction rates of no 3 no 2 and n2o the initial concentration of 30 mg no 3 n l 30 mg no 2 n l or 20 mg n2o n l was achieved by injecting nano3 nano2 or n2o stock solution obtained by sparging n2o gas into deionized water to saturation respectively the cod stock solution consisting of glucose and sodium acetate in the same proportion as the feeding synthetic wastewater was then added resulting in an initial cod n ratio of 10 since the carbon source was sufficient it can effectively avoid electron competitions among different denitrifiers the samples were collected at a time interval of 5 min for no 3 or no 2 analysis 2 3 1 2 denitrification batch test 2 to further reveal the n2o turnovers during denitrification the initial concentrations of no 3 and cod in the batch reactor were set at 16 mg n l and 75 mg l respectively almost same as those in parent reactors the samples were collected at a time interval of 20 min for no 3 and no 2 analysis 2 3 2 nitrification batch tests meanwhile two types of batch tests were performed for the investigation of the effects of pet microplastics on n2o production during nitrification 2 l of fresh mixed liquor from the parent reactor was directly added in a 2 2 l reactor with a sealable lid for each nitrification batch test the activated sludge for nitrification batch test did not need additional washing because nh 4 and no 2 were completely oxidized before the end of aerobic period fig 1 2 3 2 1 nitrification batch test 1 to assess the maximum specific oxidation rates of nh 4 and no 2 nh 4cl or nano2 stock solution was injected for an initial concentration of 50 mg nh 4 n l or 50 mg no 2 n l air was continuously sparged to supply sufficient do 6 mg o2 l the samples were collected at a time interval of 30 min for nh 4 and no 3 analysis during the 2 h batch test 2 3 2 2 nitrification batch test 2 to further reveal the n2o production during nitrification the possible factors i e concentrations of nh 4 and do were controlled to be relatively stable during the entire experiment two mass flow controllers were used to constantly adjust the n2 flow and air flow for attaining a stable do of 1 5 0 2 mg o2 l during the batch test almost same as that of aerobic phase in parent reactors the total gas flow of n2 and air was 1 l min so that the generated n2o could escaped from the liquid phase immediately moreover the gas mixture in the reactor headspace was continuously pumped into a n2o analyzer ao2000 series abb for the online gaseous n2o measurement and the pumping gas flow was also set at 1 l min after 15 min of control phase an initial concentration of 12 5 mg nh 4 n l was achieved after adding nh 4cl stock solution in the subsequent experimental phase additional nh 4cl stock solution 1 2 g n l was manually injected at a time interval of 15 min for a relatively stable nh 4 concentration of 12 5 1 5 mg n l peng et al 2014 the samples were collected at a time interval of 15 min for nh 4 no 2 and no 3 analysis 2 4 other analytical methods standard methods were applied for the measurements of nh 4 no 3 no 2 sludge volume index svi mlss and mlvss apha 1998 the particle size distribution of activated sludge was determined using a particle size analyzer zs3000 malvern instruments uk a scanning electron microscope sem was used to characterize the micro morphologies of sludge and pet microplastics hitachi s4800 japan the different extracellular polymeric substance eps fractions were extracted using a heat extraction method whereas phenol sulfuric method and lowry folin method were applied to detect polysaccharides and proteins respectively bian et al 2020 guo et al 2021 a fluorescence spectrometer hitachi f 2710 japan was used to further analyze the three dimensional excitation emission 3d eem fluorescence spectra of different eps fractions sp measurement was conducted using a nitrous oxide isotope analyzer lgr914 0060 to identify individual contributions of different n2o production pathways during nitrification sp refers to the difference in 15n distribution in central and outer positions which is influenced by isotopic fractionations due to the asymmetric linear structure n n o of n2o sp value can reflect the n2o formation processes and thus widely serve as a promising method to trace the corresponding production pathways of n2o duan et al 2017 the samples from four parent reactors were obtained on day 100 for high throughput sequencing to investigate the variations of bacterial community the real time pcr assays were conducted targeting the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s dna genes and illumina novaseq6000 was applied for the sequencing analysis detailed information was presented in supplementary material text s2 the maximum specific no 3 no 2 and n2o reduction rates were calculated by dividing the reduction rates by the mlvss concentration and the reduction rates were determined through linear regression of the no 3 no 2 and n2o profiles respectively the calculations of total n2o emission and individual contributions of different n2o production pathways during nitrification were adapted from hu et al 2010 and peng et al 2014 respectively detailed equations were presented in supplementary material text s2 the ratio of total n2o emission mg n2o n and consumed nh 4 mg nh 4 n represented the n2o emission factor ef all the tests were conducted in triplicate and mean standard deviation was applied as the results presentation data analysis was accomplished using spss 26 0 and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of pet microplastics on the overall reactor performance as shown in table 1 nh 4 and no 2 were hardly detected in the effluents for control pet 0 μg l and experimental pet 10 100 and 500 μg l reactors almost same bnr performance as the control reactor was also reported previously wang et al 2014 however the effluent concentrations of no 3 increased from 21 2 1 6 to 28 0 1 2 mg n l with the increase of pet microplastics concentrations probably because pet microplastics reduced denitrification activity the long term data on effluent no 3 n concentrations were displayed in fig s2 these results demonstrated that long term exposure to pet microplastics 10 500 μg l hardly affected nh 4 removal but slightly affected tn removal in the anoxic aerobic sbrs moreover mlss and mlvss concentrations of four reactors displayed no significant changes after long term operation indicating pet microplastics had little effect on sludge production fig 1 presented the variations of nh 4 n no 3 n no 2 n and n2o emission during a 6 h anoxic aerobic cycle after long term exposure to pet microplastics ranging from 0 500 μg l for each reactor no 3 n was gradually reduced during the anoxic period accompanied with the accumulation of no 2 n with the consumption of external carbon source no 3 n reduction rate gradually slowed down and no 2 n concentration decreased slightly in the last 30 min at the end of anoxic period the no 2 n concentration in four reactors were 4 9 0 6 6 9 0 4 8 9 0 4 and 10 4 0 5 mg n l respectively indicating that more no 2 n was accumulated during denitrification under higher concentration of pet microplastics stress in the aerobic period most nh 4 n was oxidized within 1 h for all reactors and the rapid decrease of no 2 n was also observed especially for experimental reactors notably the no 2 n concentrations in four reactors were almost at the same levels 1 5 0 3 mg n l at 156 min and then decreased to 0 at 186 min moreover the final no 3 n concentrations in experimental reactors were slightly higher than that in control reactor consist with effluent results in table 1 as shown in fig 1c the profiles of emitted n2o concentration in all reactors displayed very similar trends negligible n2o emission was observed during anoxic period and the n2o concentration increased sharply as the aerobic period begun n2o emission mostly happened in the first one hour of aerobic period similar as nh 4 n oxidation besides the average n2o efs in four reactors were 0 91 0 97 0 86 and 0 83 respectively p 0 05 suggesting the n2o emissions under pet microplastics stress were comparable to that in the control reactor fig 1d it is well known that nitrification plays a dominant role in n2o emission from bnr process and an increase in no 2 n concentration 0 50 mg n l significantly results in higher n2o production by aob peng et al 2015 wang et al 2016a surprisingly the average n2o efs in experimental reactors were comparable to that in control reactor despite more no 2 n accumulation from 4 9 to 10 4 mg n l in anoxic period fig 1 previous studies have demonstrated microplastics could cause impacts to microbial activity through several mechanisms such as leaching toxic chemicals i e additives and increasing reactive oxygen species generation seeley et al 2020 wei et al 2020 it was reasonable to assume that pet microplastics may affect the n2o turnovers which are closely related to microbial activity additionally some recent work has preliminarily revealed that microplastics might affect n2o emission during bnr process li et al 2020 han et al 2022 therefore the hypothesis that long term exposure to pet microplastics may significantly affect n2o turnovers during mainstream bnr process was proposed in this work in the coming text the effects of pet microplastics on nitrogen transformations and n2o turnovers during denitrification and nitrification were fully explored 3 2 insights into n2o turnovers under pet microplastics stress during denitrification as an example fig 2 a displayed the variations of no 3 no 2 and n2o in denitrification batch test 1 for the control reactor pet 0 μg l and others were presented in fig s3 according to these profiles and corresponding mlvss concentrations the maximum specific no 3 no 2 and n2o reduction rates were determined and summarized in fig 2b apparently with the increase of pet microplastics concentrations a declining trend of the maximum specific no 3 no 2 and n2o reduction rates was observed indicating the negative effects of pet microplastics on denitrification performance for all reactors the maximum specific reduction rates were in the order of n2o no 3 no 2 among them the maximum specific n2o reduction rate was most sensitive to pet microplastics with its value sharply decreasing from 82 6 0 2 mg n hr g vss at pet 0 μg l to 39 7 0 1 mg n hr g vss at pet 10 μg l decreased by 50 4 nevertheless a tiny decline was observed from 39 7 0 1 to 38 0 mg 0 1 n hr g vss among the experimental reactors pet 10 100 and 500 μg l fig 2b the variations of no 3 no 2 and n2o in denitrification batch test 2 for the control reactor were shown in fig 2c since the external carbon source was not sufficient for complete reduction of no 3 i e in situ conditions similar as parent reactors the no 3 reduction rate was relatively high in the first 20 min while no 3 was reduced very slowly from 20 to 120 min denoted as endogenous denitrification pan et al 2019 it can be seen that n2o accumulation occurred during the endogenous denitrification for all the reactors fig 2d among them control reactor was the first to start accumulating n2o at 27 min and its n2o concentration was also highest through the entire test experimental reactors started accumulating n2o slightly later with the latest time of 40 min for pet 500 μg l reactor moreover the n2o concentrations at 120 min for experimental reactors were 0 6 pet 10 μg l 0 4 pet 100 μg l and 0 3 pet 500 μg l mg n l respectively all of which were lower than that of control reactor 0 9 mg n l based on above batch tests it could be inferred that less n2o was produced during denitrification for the experimental reactors these results indicated that pet microplastics reduced both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification and n2o accumulation was also declined under pet microplastics stress notably these negative effects became stronger with the increase of pet microplastics concentration 3 3 insights into n2o production under pet microplastics stress during nitrification the activities of aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are usually assessed by the maximum specific nh 4 and no 2 oxidation rates respectively wang et al 2014 in fig 3 a no significant difference in the maximum specific nh 4 oxidation rates among the control and experimental reactors was observed with an average value of 8 3 0 3 mg n hr g vss however the maximum specific no 2 oxidation rate gradually increased from 9 5 0 8 mg n hr g vss in control reactor to 12 2 0 1 mg n hr g vss in pet 100 μg l reactor and then decreased to 11 0 0 3 mg n hr g vss in the pet 500 μg l reactor therefore aob was considered to be capable of tolerating pet microplastics ranging from 10 to 500 μg l whereas nob might be enhanced showing the highest activity at a pet microplastics concentration of 100 μg l as an example fig 3b showed the nh 4 do and n2o profiles in nitrification batch test 2 for the pet 500 μg l reactor and others were presented in fig s4 during the initial 15 min control phase n2o concentration remained constant at 0 ppmv suggesting no n2o produced by heterotrophic denitrification therefore the n2o production throughout the entire batch test came from nitrification and the effect of heterotrophic bacteria was negligible after the addition of nh 4 n2o concentration increased sharply within 8 min and then gradually declined during the entire experimental phase nh 4 concentration remained constantly at 12 8 0 3 mg n l a level almost same as the initial nh 4 concentration in parent reactors n2o efs were calculated according to the measured nh 4 n concentrations and added nh 4 n solution wang et al 2016a as shown in fig 3c the n2o profiles of all reactors showed very similar trends during the entire tests however the n2o production was apparently in the order of pet 0 μg l pet 10 μg l pet 100 μg l pet 500 μg l indicating that n2o production during nitrification was reduced with the increased pet microplastics concentrations the average n2o efs in different reactors during nitrification batch test 2 were 1 0 0 7 0 5 and 0 3 respectively p 0 05 fig 3d further suggesting that the n2o production during nitrification decreased as the presence of pet microplastics increased to further analyze the effects of pet microplastics on n2o production pathways during nitrification the n2o sps in each reactor were determined using an isotope analyzer results showed that sp values increased from 4 7 1 7 in control reactor to 14 7 2 2 in pet 100 μg l reactor and then slightly decreased to 13 9 2 1 in pet 500 μg l reactor fig s5 a rapid increase of sp values was observed from the control reactor to pet 10 μg l reactor indicating long term exposure to pet microplastics even at low level may change the n2o production pathways during nitrification fig 4 displayed the variations of relative contributions to n2o production under pet microplastics stress for the control reactor aob denitrification pathway played a dominant role with a relative contribution of 78 0 consistent with previous reports wunderlin et al 2012 peng et al 2014 as the pet microplastics level increasing from 0 to 100 μg l a decrease in the relative contribution of aob denitrification pathway from 78 0 to 45 1 was observed whereas the contribution by nh2oh oxidation pathway increased to 54 9 moreover the pet 500 μg l reactor had a slightly higher contribution for aob denitrification pathway in comparison to the pet 100 μg l reactor p 0 05 which might be owing to the decreased nob activity fig 3a and fig 6b it was confirmed that pet microplastics enhanced the specific no 2 oxidation rates but hardly affected nh 4 oxidation rates in the experimental reactors fig 3a therefore the generated no 2 may be quickly oxidized to no 3 rather than reduced to n2o via aob denitrification pathway resulting in lower relative contributions of aob denitrification pathway in the experimental reactors kim et al 2010 peng et al 2015 3 4 interaction between pet microplastics and bnr sludge to uncover the interaction between pet microplastics and bnr sludge the characteristic changes after long term exposure to pet microplastics were explored fig s6 displayed that svi increased from 47 4 1 2 ml g in control reactor to 62 4 1 5 ml g in pet 500 μg l reactor p 0 05 reflecting that the sludge settleability might be negatively affected under pet microplastics stress in fig 5 a the sludge particle sizes in the experimental reactors were significantly larger than that in control reactor with the medium particle diameter dv 0 5 increased by over 2 5 times from 77 1 2 1 μm to 199 4 8 μm previous studies reported microplastics could interact with organics and eps aggregation to form larger particles xu et al 2021 which was also observed by sem images in this work fig 5e besides the specific surface areas sharply decreased from 210 4 1 7 m2 kg in control reactor to 60 63 1 3 in pet 100 μg l reactor and 61 41 2 2 in pet 500 μg l reactor probably due to the increased particle sizes yuan et al 2021 fig 5b presented the variations of eps components after long term exposure to pet microplastics at different concentrations as pet microplastics concentrations increasing from 0 to 500 μg l protein and polysaccharide two main components of eps increased from 52 6 1 8 to 70 2 2 3 mg g vss and 5 5 0 7 to 11 1 1 0 mg g vss respectively which was also confirmed by the increased fluorescence intensities of 3d eem spectra fig s7 the higher fluorescence intensity of region ⅳ which represents the concentration of hydrophilic acids in the experimental reactors indicated that pet microplastics enhanced the hydrophilic performance of eps probably leading to worse sludge dewatering yuan et al 2021 the surface morphologies of pristine pet microplastics and activated sludge with or without long term exposure to pet microplastics 100 μg l were shown in fig 5c e the pristine pet microplastics had relatively smooth surfaces along with some debris generated during the manufacturing process fig 5c after long term operation the pet microplastics displayed much rougher surface and shrunken shapes accompanied with numerous holes fig 5e and fig s8 and the original debris was no longer observed on the microplastic surface because of the hydraulic shearing mahon et al 2017 in fig 5d a large number of cocci bacilli and eps aggregation as well as a few filamentous bacteria were observed for the sludge from control reactor similar microbial distributions were also found in the experimental reactor except that microplastics particles were entangled and wrapped by activated sludge fig 5e in the experimental reactor pet 100 μg l more eps secretion was due to the microbial protective mechanism following the occurrence of environmental stimuli i e protecting the bacterial activities from pet microplastics fig 5b fu et al 2022 however the abundant eps might increase sludge viscosity and promote sludge flocculation resulting in the potential adhesion and aggregation of activated sludge on the pet microplastics surface martinez et al 2004 wei et al 2020 besides the much rougher surface with emerging holes of pet microplastics after long term operation would increase their specific surface areas and facilitate organics adsorption e g eps fig 5e and fig s8 xu et al 2021 therefore more small size microplastics were embedded inside the sludge floc resulting in the sharply increased sludge particle size in the experimental reactor indeed the bnr process is usually completed by a series of electron transfer and consumption among functional oxidoreductases and substrates such sludge morphology might prevent the nutrient matrix delivery and electron transfer in the experimental reactor wei et al 2020 chen et al 2021 due to the limited substrate load i e external carbon source inside the experimental sludge floc intensified electron competition occurred among various reductases during denitrification nevertheless the competitive no 3 reductase would preferentially obtain electrons therefore both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification decreased under pet microplastics stress fig 2 liu et al 2018 for nitrification process the increase in particle size of activated sludge usually resulted in higher n2o production liu et al 2020 duan et al 2021 the opposite results from this work indicated the key factor in reducing n2o production during nitrification was the reshaped microbial community rather than the changed sludge morphology on the one hand the enhanced nob activity in the experimental reactors could reduce no 2 accumulation and thus reduce n2o production during nitrification fig 3 peng et al 2015 on the other hand the significantly increased microbial richness and diversity under pet microplastics stress might play an important role in reducing n2o production since the n2o production capacities vary greatly among different microorganisms fig 6 and fig s9 ren et al 2019 which also provided a reasonable explanation for the difference in n2o production between the pet 500 µg l reactor and pet 10 µg l reactor fig 3 in the future further in depth analyses e g genomics and proteomics are required to reveal the underlying relationship between n2o production and microbial community moreover the larger sludge particle size and irregular surface of pet microplastics in the experimental reactor provided more anaerobic microenvironment inside the sludge flocs it was a reasonable explanation for the enhanced microbial diversity particularly denitrifiers in experimental reactor fig 6b although anaerobic microenvironment might be favorable to denitrification the sharp decline in the relative abundance of dominant denitrifiers i e thauera would significantly reduce denitrification rates fig 6b 3 5 effects of pet microplastics on the microbial community and nitrogen metabolism the effects of long term exposure to pet microplastics 0 500 μg l on microbial community were analyzed the rarefaction curves of four samples demonstrated that the whole microbial species were effectively captured and the sequencing results were reasonable fig s9a the alpha diversity metrics was used to evaluate the microbial richness and diversity as shown in fig s9b the control reactor obviously had the lowest values of simpson 0 87 shannon 5 09 and chao 245 indexes and no significant difference of the three indexes among experimental reactors was observed these results reflected that tiny amounts of pet microplastics 10 μg l could increase the richness and diversity of microorganisms in mainstream bnr reactors and this potential impact did not become much stronger even at the level of pet 500 μg l a recent study also found that the microbial diversity of ags were increased after the addition of 0 5 g l pes microplastics qin et al 2020 furthermore the number of common otus 118 was 15 6 of the total otus in four reactors 759 suggesting the severe effects of pet microplastics on microbial community fig s10 the distributions of microbial community at phylum level were displayed in fig 6a proteobacteria bacteroidota nitrospirota myxococcota and acidobacteriota were the dominant phylum in all reactors accounting for 89 7 93 3 of the total bacterial sequences among them proteobacteria consisting of various bacteria related to the removal of nitrogen phosphorus and cod qin et al 2020 decreased from 69 6 in control reactor to 49 1 average value in experimental reactors bacteroidota was reported to be associated with the degradation of polymers and complex organic substances zhang et al 2017 the significantly increased relative abundances of bacteroidota indicated that biological degradation of pet microplastics might occur in the experimental reactors which provided a reasonable explanation for the rough surface and numerous holes of pet microplastics after long term operation fig 5e and fig s8 in addition the relative abundances of nitrospirota and acidobacteriota in experimental reactors were also much higher in comparison to the control reactor fig 6a these results revealed that pet microplastics had reshaped the microbial community by positively or negatively affecting the abundances of dominant phylum the main functional species involved in denitrification and nitrification were further analyzed at genus level as shown in fig 6b thauera was the dominant denitrifier in all reactors which was attributed to the carbon source consisting of glucose and sodium acetate ren et al 2019 with the increase in pet microplastics concentrations the relative abundance of thauera decreased from 12 9 to 8 3 indicating the negative impacts of pet microplastics moreover the declined abundance of thauera would lead to less n2o production ren et al 2019 the relative abundance of rhodobacter decreased sharply from 3 3 in control reactor to 0 5 average value in experimental reactors previous studies reported that rhodobacter was highly associated with n2o emission and nirk gene expression thereby leading to no 2 accumulation fig 1 vieira et al 2019 on the contrary the relative abundances of dokdonella denitifiers associated with the reduction of no 3 and no 2 zhou et al 2022 and unclassified saprospiraceae denitifiers associated with the degradation of organic compounds mao et al 2022 increased after long term exposure to pet microplastics suggesting their high resistant to pet microplastics in addition some emerging denitrifiers with low abundances were found in experimental reactors such as dechloromonas 0 1 0 6 hyphomicrobium 0 1 0 2 and sulfuritalea 0 2 0 4 wang et al 2016b 2021 further demonstrating the enhanced microbial diversity under pet microplastics stress table s1 as for nitrifiers the relative abundance of nitrosomonas increased from 0 7 in control reactor to 1 1 in pet 100 μg l reactor it was reported that n2o produced by nitrosomonas mainly came from nh2oh oxidation pathway ren et al 2019 providing a reasonable explanation for the increased relative contribution of nh2oh oxidation pathway in this work fig 4 nitrospira is closely related to no 2 oxidation during nitrification and its relative abundance showed same changing trend as the maximum no 2 oxidation rate fig 6b and fig 3 further confirming pet microplastics enhanced nob activity bian et al 2020 these results also indicated that nitrifiers were basically tolerant of the long term exposure of pet microplastics 10 500 μg l in addition the enrichment of comammox nitrospira an organism performing complete ammonia oxidation to no 2 without n2o production may occur in the high abundance of nitrospira sp environment roots et al 2019 which may be a putative reason for the decreased n2o production during nitrification in experimental reactors fig 3 whether long term exposure to pet microplastics resulted in the occurrence of comammox nitrospira needs further investigation in the future to further obtain the significant changes of molecular functions of bacteria under pet microplastics stress phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust2 was used for the prediction of the nitrogen metabolism pathways during bnr process fig 6c which was based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database cui et al 2019 four nitrogen micro transformations i e denitrification nitrification dissimilatory assimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation were involved and no anammox enzymes represented by ec 1 7 2 7 was observed table s2 in this study the relative abundances of functional enzymes genes were used to evaluate the capability of nitrogen metabolism for example in the denitrification pathway the no 3 reductases represented by ec 1 7 99 1 k00374 and k02568 and ec 1 9 6 1 k02567 decreased from 4 8 at pet 0 μg l level to 4 1 at pet 10 μg l level the reductases of no 2 and no had similar changing profiles with the no 3 reductases particularly the no reductases represented by ec 1 7 2 5 k04561 were reduced by almost half from 7 0 at pet 0 μg l level to 3 5 at pet 10 μg l level indicating that the functional genes expressions and no reductases activities were negatively affected under pet microplastics stress the n2o reductases i e n2o reduction capacities showed no significant changes among control and experimental reactors as a result less n2o emissions were measured in experimental reactors figs 1 3 in addition the genes of nxr reflecting the no 2 oxidation during nitrification were much more abundant in experimental reactors 16 7 17 1 than those in control reactor 11 0 it should be noted that these functional enzymes changed slightly with the increased concentrations of pet microplastics 10 500 μg l consistent with the results of microbial community composition and diversity fig 6 these results further demonstrated the effects of pet microplastics on nitrogen metabolism including n2o turnovers at the gene level 3 6 overall understandings and implications recently the ubiquitous microplastics have attracted great attention especially for their impacts on microbial metabolism in biological wastewater treatment however few studies were available to explore the effects of microplastics on n2o turnovers in mainstream bnr process which is closely related to the greenhouse effect and biogeochemical cycle this work confirmed that both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification were reduced under pet microplastics stress even at environmental level i e 10 μg l as well as the n2o production during nitrification for the first time it was revealed that the contributions from heterotrophic bacteria pathway and aob denitrification pathway to n2o production were negatively affected by pet microplastics whereas the contribution from nh2oh pathway was positively enhanced the following two reasons were revealed to be closely related to the significant effects of pet microplastics on n2o turnovers in mainstream bnr process on one side the remarkable increase of sludge particle size via the interaction between pet microplastics and bnr sludge led to an intensified electron competition among various reductases thereby reducing n2o production and reduction during denitrification because of the absolute competitiveness of no 3 reductase chen et al 2021 on the other side pet microplastics not only altered the eps characteristics of the bnr sludge but also reshaped the microbial community and nitrogen metabolism pathway particularly the denitrifiers e g thauera and rhodobacter highly associated with n2o emission and the nirk gene expressions were both decreased resulting in more no 2 accumulation during denitrification fig 1 the representative nob nitrospirota had much higher abundance under pet microplastics stress corresponding to the increased no 2 oxidation rate fig 3 which thus inhibited aob denitrification pathway and the resulting n2o production during nitrification fig 4 in addition the significant changes of eps production of the bnr sludge induced by pet microplastics also reflected the changes of microbial activity above results demonstrated that the negative effects of pet microplastics on mainstream bnr at wwtps would already occur but was previously ignored due to the inadequate assessment methods and emission standards despite growing calls for more effective management of plastic products to reduce microplastics sources it is unfortunately not possible at present to control the microplastics in municipal wastewater at negligible level most of the microplastics in wastewater would be captured by activated sludge wei et al 2021 therefore microplastics can accumulate to a significant extent in activated sludge system after long term operation because they can only be removed with the sludge purging the implications of this work would help to comprehensively understand the role of microplastics in biological wastewater treatment and thus develop targeted strategies to further mitigate n2o emission under pet microplastics stress in mainstream bnr process previous strategies e g enhance aeration which mainly focused on inhibiting aob denitrification pathway to achieve n2o mitigation may not be suitable for the current wastewater with emerging microplastics since nh2oh oxidation pathway rather than aob denitrification played a dominant role in n2o production under microplastics stress fig 4 as confirmed previously do have a positive effect on the n2o production via nh2oh oxidation pathway thus an appropriate do should be controlled during aerobic period to promote n2o mitigation in bnr under microplastics stress in addition the findings of the relevance of n2o contributing pathways with microplastics from this work provided new insights for possibly modifying the current n2o models to capture the microplastics induced effects on n2o turnovers in order to accurately predict n2o emission from the bnr process under the microplastics stress 4 conclusion this is the first work to reveal the potential effect and underlying mechanism of long term exposure to pet microplastics on n2o turnovers during mainstream bnr process the main conclusions were as follows 1 pet microplastics had no significant effect on nh 4 removal but reduced tn removal efficiency nitrification was hardly affected while denitrification rates decreased under pet microplastics stress besides the comparable n2o efs in experimental reactors were mainly attributed to more no 2 accumulation in anoxic period rather than the tolerance to pet microplastics 2 pet microplastics reduced both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification and the n2o accumulation within 120 min decreased from 0 9 to 0 3 mg n l with the increase of pet microplastics 3 the n2o production during nitrification was also reduced by 30 70 under pet microplastics stress while the relative contribution of aob denitrification pathway decreased from 78 0 to 45 1 because of the enhanced no 2 oxidation rate 4 pet microplastics even at environmental level i e 10 μg l significantly increased sludge particle size and eps secretion as well as reshaped microbial community by increasing microbial diversity and affecting bacterial

15499,the ubiquitous microplastics in wastewater have raised growing concerns due to their unintended effects on microbial activities however whether and how microplastics affect nitrous oxide n2o a potent greenhouse gas turnovers in mainstream biological nitrogen removal bnr process remain unclear this work therefore aimed to fill such knowledge gap by conducting both long term and batch tests after over 100 days of feeding with wastewater containing polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics 0 500 μg l the long term results showed that both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification were reduced as well as the n2o production during nitrification accordingly 60 reduction in n2o accumulation and 70 reduction in n2o production were observed in the denitrification and nitrification batch tests respectively nevertheless the long term n2o emission factors under pet microplastics stress were comparable to that in the control reactor mainly because pet microplastics led to more nitrite accumulation in anoxic period with the aid of online n2o sensors and site preference analysis it was demonstrated that the heterotrophic bacteria pathway and ammonia oxidizing bacteria denitrification pathway for n2o production were negatively affected by pet microplastics whereas a clear increase in the contribution of hydroxylamine pathway 22 9 was observed further investigation revealed that pet microplastics even at environmental level i e 10 μg l significantly reshaped the bnr sludge characteristics e g much larger particle size and microbial communities e g thauera rhodobacte and nitrospira as well as the nitrogen metabolism pathways which were chiefly responsible for the changes of n2o turnovers and n2o production pathways under the pet microplastics

made available on request 1 introduction due to the massive usage but poor management of plastics plastic pollution especially microplastics have become one of the most severe environmental problems posing threat to many organisms and human beings okoffo et al 2021 thomas 2022 microplastics were first proposed in 2004 and defined as synthetic polymers smaller than 5 mm thompson et al 2004 so far microplastics have been ubiquitously found in water bodies soil environments and living organisms even in human blood sharma et al 2021 leslie et al 2022 the direct release of manufactured microbeads commonly applied in personal care and cosmetic products ppcps and fragmentation of large plastics because of sunlight irradiation physical wear biochemical degradation and etc are the main sources of primary and secondary microplastics respectively shahul hamid et al 2018 zurier and goddard 2021 rauert et al 2022 as one of the emerging pollutants microplastics have raised wide public and scientific concerns mai et al 2019 liu et al 2021 he et al 2022 studies have found that microplastics not only contain harmful additives added during production processes such as heavy metals phthalates and dibutyl phthalate but also effectively adsorb persistent organic pollutants benefiting from their hydrophobicity and considerable specific surface areas forming wandering contaminant composites zhang et al 2020 in addition microplastics are easily ingested by various organisms such as zooplankton taxa fish and seabirds derraik 2002 cole et al 2013 these ingested microplastics and the associated toxins may bioaccumulate in living organisms and biomagnify up the food chain yoon et al 2021 therefore the widespread microplastics readily interacts with organisms and even affects the ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles wastewater treatment plants wwtps are generally identified as a sink of various contaminants including microplastics wei et al 2019 the fate and detection of microplastics in wwtps have been well revealed sun et al 2019 although the microplastics concentration in the inlet wastewater was reported to vary from 61 to 1189 μg l and 98 3 of them were removed by the activated sludge system simon et al 2018 whether and how the long term exposure to microplastics affects wastewater treatment process particularly mainstream biological nitrogen removal bnr needs further investigation bnr process generally involves nitrification which occurs by nitrifying bacteria in the aerobic phase oxidizing ammonium nh 4 to nitrate no 3 with nitrite no 2 as intermediate and denitrification which occurs by denitrifying bacteria in the anoxic phase reducing no 3 to dinitrogen n2 step by step notably the nitrous oxide n2o emission from bnr process has been a global concern due to its potent greenhouse effect over 250 times than that of co2 and ozone depleting property duan et al 2021 as an inevitable byproduct n2o is mainly generated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob via hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation and aob denitrification pathway poth and focht 1985 and it is also an intermediate during denitrification firestone et al 1979 these interlaced biochemical processes are highly susceptible to external factors ultimately altering the nitrogen metabolism including n2o turnovers i e production and reduction of n2o for example a series of comparative studies indicated the sudden addition of microplastics e g polyvinylchloride pvc and polyether sulfone pes showed negative effects on ammonium oxidation but positive effects on denitrification li et al 2020 however knowledge of microplastics affecting the nitrogen metabolism in activated sludge is still limited qin et al 2020 reported that the 30 day exposure to pes microplastics 0 1 0 5 g l reduced nh 4 removal efficiency but showed no evident effect on tn removal for aerobic granular sludge ags zhou et al 2022 have proved that polystyrene ps microplastics 100 μm with low or high concentrations 10 or 1000 μg l showed little effects on tn removal of the anoxic aerobic bnr system within 40 days while high level 1000 μg l of ps nanoplastics 100 nm exhibited greatly negative impacts moreover the microbial community was significantly reshaped by microplastics leading to changes in bnr performance despite these interesting findings there is no systematic study on the long term effects of microplastics on each nitrogen metabolism step during mainstream bnr process and indeed whether microplastics affect n2o turnovers and the underlying mechanisms are largely unexplored all of these are critical for the overall understanding of the impacts of microplastics on bnr process and even biogeochemical cycle thus the objective of this work is to reveal the long term effects of entering microplastics in wastewater on n2o turnovers in mainstream bnr process polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics are commonly detected in influent of wwtps due to the widespread utilization of pet in synthetic clothes sun et al 2019 some previous studies have only revealed the impacts of pet microplastics on anaerobic granular sludge and anaerobic digestion process zhang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 thus it was used as the model microplastics in this study after over 100 day exposure to different concentrations of pet microplastics 0 10 100 and 500 μg l in different sequencing batch reactors sbrs a series of sbr cycle and batch tests were carried out to examine the production and reduction of n2o during denitrification and nitrification processes in particular the individual contributions of nh2oh oxidation and aob denitrification pathways to nitrification process were determined based on site preference sp measurements furthermore the variations of microbial community and nitrogen metabolism pathways under long term pet microplastics stress were also analyzed the findings of this work might provide a first insight and a comprehensive understanding of n2o turnovers under pet microplastics stress in mainstream bnr process 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of pet microplastics and synthetic wastewater the pet microplastics were obtained from huachuang co ltd dongguan china which had an average size of 80 μm to simulate their contents in the actual wastewater 15 μg l and predictive growing concentrations in the future yang et al 2020 three experimental reactors feeding with different concentrations of pet microplastics 10 100 and 500 μg l and a control reactor pet 0 μg l were operated in this work the pet microplastics stock solution was diluted to different exposure concentrations in the synthetic wastewater after 60 s of ultrasonic treatment wei et al 2021 the simulated wastewater was synthesized as follow per liter 191 07 mg of nh4cl 212 26 mg of glucose c6h12o 96 15 mg of ch3coona 540 00 mg of nahco3 67 74 mg of k2hpo4 h2o 15 12 mg of mgso4 10 25 mg of cacl2 and 0 6 ml of trace element solution text s1 therefore the resulting influent contained 300 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod and 50 mg n l nh 4 mimicking the typical wastewater for mainstream bnr zhou et al 2022 2 2 reactor setup and operation four replicate 10 l sbrs were conducted in a temperature controlled 22 1 c room away from sunlight each reactor has a cycle time of 360 min consisting of 6 min feeding 90 min anoxic period 220 min aerobic period 1 min sludge wasting 39 min settling 3 min decanting and 1 min idle period 2 5 l of synthetic wastewater was fed per cycle achieving a hydraulic retention time of 24 h according to the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations of effluent and wasting sludge the solids retention time were estimated to be 20 days a minichem do2 and a ph probe were used for the online continuous monitoring of dissolved oxygen do and ph of each reactor throughout the aerobic phase do was maintained in the range of 1 3 1 7 mg o2 l using an on off control system the aeration would be automatically turned on when do was below 1 3 mg o2 l once do exceeded 1 7 mg o2 l the aeration would be automatically turned off ph was not controlled and results showed that it varied between 7 35 and 7 65 the above operation processes for each reactor were automatically carried out by a programmable logic controller plc after about 60 days operation stable bnr performances effluent concentrations 0 1 0 1 mg nh 4 n l 20 6 1 8 mg no 3 n l and 0 1 0 1 mg no 2 n l were achieved for all reactors all the sludge was withdrawn and mixed and then equally shared among four reactors for the pet exposure experiments synthetic wastewater containing additional 10 100 and 500 μg l pet microplastics were prepared for the three experimental reactors see details in section 2 1 except different concentrations of pet microplastics in the feeding wastewater other conditions and operations were the same as before the initial concentrations of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and mlss in each reactor were about 1720 18 and 2000 30 mg l respectively the control and experimental reactors under different concentrations of pet microplastics stress have been running continuously for more than 100 days for cyclic studies the samples were obtained on day 105 110 and 115 every 30 min during one 6 h cycle for the measurements of nh 4 no 3 and no 2 the operation process was the same as that of parent reactor which was automatically controlled by a plc a n2o analyzer was used to determine n2o emission section 2 3 2 2 3 batch experiments after over 100 day exposure to pet microplastics the mixed liquor was obtained from parent reactors at the end of aerobic period to carry out batch tests in the designed sealable reactors for examining both denitrification and nitrification activities throughout each batch test the mixed liquor was under magnetic stirring and ph was maintained at 7 50 0 15 almost same as that in parent reactors by automatically adding hcl 1 m or nahco3 1 m with the aid of plc mlvss concentration in the batch reactor was measured in triplicate for each batch test 2 3 1 denitrification batch tests to explore the effects of pet microplastics on n2o turnovers during denitrification two types of batch tests were designed for the complete removal of residual nutrients i e external carbon source and inorganic nitrogen 500 ml of mixed liquor from the parent reactor was centrifuged 6000 rpm for 6 min and washed with tap water for three times before being resuspended to 500 ml in a 550 ml batch reactor there is no headspace in the batch reactor after immobilizing probes for the detection of do ph and dissolved n2o n2 gas was sparged until do dropped below 0 1 mg o2 l forming anoxic condition for the subsequent denitrification test a microsensor was used to continuously monitor the n2o concentration in liquid phase online 2 3 1 1 denitrification batch test 1 to assess the maximum specific reduction rates of no 3 no 2 and n2o the initial concentration of 30 mg no 3 n l 30 mg no 2 n l or 20 mg n2o n l was achieved by injecting nano3 nano2 or n2o stock solution obtained by sparging n2o gas into deionized water to saturation respectively the cod stock solution consisting of glucose and sodium acetate in the same proportion as the feeding synthetic wastewater was then added resulting in an initial cod n ratio of 10 since the carbon source was sufficient it can effectively avoid electron competitions among different denitrifiers the samples were collected at a time interval of 5 min for no 3 or no 2 analysis 2 3 1 2 denitrification batch test 2 to further reveal the n2o turnovers during denitrification the initial concentrations of no 3 and cod in the batch reactor were set at 16 mg n l and 75 mg l respectively almost same as those in parent reactors the samples were collected at a time interval of 20 min for no 3 and no 2 analysis 2 3 2 nitrification batch tests meanwhile two types of batch tests were performed for the investigation of the effects of pet microplastics on n2o production during nitrification 2 l of fresh mixed liquor from the parent reactor was directly added in a 2 2 l reactor with a sealable lid for each nitrification batch test the activated sludge for nitrification batch test did not need additional washing because nh 4 and no 2 were completely oxidized before the end of aerobic period fig 1 2 3 2 1 nitrification batch test 1 to assess the maximum specific oxidation rates of nh 4 and no 2 nh 4cl or nano2 stock solution was injected for an initial concentration of 50 mg nh 4 n l or 50 mg no 2 n l air was continuously sparged to supply sufficient do 6 mg o2 l the samples were collected at a time interval of 30 min for nh 4 and no 3 analysis during the 2 h batch test 2 3 2 2 nitrification batch test 2 to further reveal the n2o production during nitrification the possible factors i e concentrations of nh 4 and do were controlled to be relatively stable during the entire experiment two mass flow controllers were used to constantly adjust the n2 flow and air flow for attaining a stable do of 1 5 0 2 mg o2 l during the batch test almost same as that of aerobic phase in parent reactors the total gas flow of n2 and air was 1 l min so that the generated n2o could escaped from the liquid phase immediately moreover the gas mixture in the reactor headspace was continuously pumped into a n2o analyzer ao2000 series abb for the online gaseous n2o measurement and the pumping gas flow was also set at 1 l min after 15 min of control phase an initial concentration of 12 5 mg nh 4 n l was achieved after adding nh 4cl stock solution in the subsequent experimental phase additional nh 4cl stock solution 1 2 g n l was manually injected at a time interval of 15 min for a relatively stable nh 4 concentration of 12 5 1 5 mg n l peng et al 2014 the samples were collected at a time interval of 15 min for nh 4 no 2 and no 3 analysis 2 4 other analytical methods standard methods were applied for the measurements of nh 4 no 3 no 2 sludge volume index svi mlss and mlvss apha 1998 the particle size distribution of activated sludge was determined using a particle size analyzer zs3000 malvern instruments uk a scanning electron microscope sem was used to characterize the micro morphologies of sludge and pet microplastics hitachi s4800 japan the different extracellular polymeric substance eps fractions were extracted using a heat extraction method whereas phenol sulfuric method and lowry folin method were applied to detect polysaccharides and proteins respectively bian et al 2020 guo et al 2021 a fluorescence spectrometer hitachi f 2710 japan was used to further analyze the three dimensional excitation emission 3d eem fluorescence spectra of different eps fractions sp measurement was conducted using a nitrous oxide isotope analyzer lgr914 0060 to identify individual contributions of different n2o production pathways during nitrification sp refers to the difference in 15n distribution in central and outer positions which is influenced by isotopic fractionations due to the asymmetric linear structure n n o of n2o sp value can reflect the n2o formation processes and thus widely serve as a promising method to trace the corresponding production pathways of n2o duan et al 2017 the samples from four parent reactors were obtained on day 100 for high throughput sequencing to investigate the variations of bacterial community the real time pcr assays were conducted targeting the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s dna genes and illumina novaseq6000 was applied for the sequencing analysis detailed information was presented in supplementary material text s2 the maximum specific no 3 no 2 and n2o reduction rates were calculated by dividing the reduction rates by the mlvss concentration and the reduction rates were determined through linear regression of the no 3 no 2 and n2o profiles respectively the calculations of total n2o emission and individual contributions of different n2o production pathways during nitrification were adapted from hu et al 2010 and peng et al 2014 respectively detailed equations were presented in supplementary material text s2 the ratio of total n2o emission mg n2o n and consumed nh 4 mg nh 4 n represented the n2o emission factor ef all the tests were conducted in triplicate and mean standard deviation was applied as the results presentation data analysis was accomplished using spss 26 0 and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of pet microplastics on the overall reactor performance as shown in table 1 nh 4 and no 2 were hardly detected in the effluents for control pet 0 μg l and experimental pet 10 100 and 500 μg l reactors almost same bnr performance as the control reactor was also reported previously wang et al 2014 however the effluent concentrations of no 3 increased from 21 2 1 6 to 28 0 1 2 mg n l with the increase of pet microplastics concentrations probably because pet microplastics reduced denitrification activity the long term data on effluent no 3 n concentrations were displayed in fig s2 these results demonstrated that long term exposure to pet microplastics 10 500 μg l hardly affected nh 4 removal but slightly affected tn removal in the anoxic aerobic sbrs moreover mlss and mlvss concentrations of four reactors displayed no significant changes after long term operation indicating pet microplastics had little effect on sludge production fig 1 presented the variations of nh 4 n no 3 n no 2 n and n2o emission during a 6 h anoxic aerobic cycle after long term exposure to pet microplastics ranging from 0 500 μg l for each reactor no 3 n was gradually reduced during the anoxic period accompanied with the accumulation of no 2 n with the consumption of external carbon source no 3 n reduction rate gradually slowed down and no 2 n concentration decreased slightly in the last 30 min at the end of anoxic period the no 2 n concentration in four reactors were 4 9 0 6 6 9 0 4 8 9 0 4 and 10 4 0 5 mg n l respectively indicating that more no 2 n was accumulated during denitrification under higher concentration of pet microplastics stress in the aerobic period most nh 4 n was oxidized within 1 h for all reactors and the rapid decrease of no 2 n was also observed especially for experimental reactors notably the no 2 n concentrations in four reactors were almost at the same levels 1 5 0 3 mg n l at 156 min and then decreased to 0 at 186 min moreover the final no 3 n concentrations in experimental reactors were slightly higher than that in control reactor consist with effluent results in table 1 as shown in fig 1c the profiles of emitted n2o concentration in all reactors displayed very similar trends negligible n2o emission was observed during anoxic period and the n2o concentration increased sharply as the aerobic period begun n2o emission mostly happened in the first one hour of aerobic period similar as nh 4 n oxidation besides the average n2o efs in four reactors were 0 91 0 97 0 86 and 0 83 respectively p 0 05 suggesting the n2o emissions under pet microplastics stress were comparable to that in the control reactor fig 1d it is well known that nitrification plays a dominant role in n2o emission from bnr process and an increase in no 2 n concentration 0 50 mg n l significantly results in higher n2o production by aob peng et al 2015 wang et al 2016a surprisingly the average n2o efs in experimental reactors were comparable to that in control reactor despite more no 2 n accumulation from 4 9 to 10 4 mg n l in anoxic period fig 1 previous studies have demonstrated microplastics could cause impacts to microbial activity through several mechanisms such as leaching toxic chemicals i e additives and increasing reactive oxygen species generation seeley et al 2020 wei et al 2020 it was reasonable to assume that pet microplastics may affect the n2o turnovers which are closely related to microbial activity additionally some recent work has preliminarily revealed that microplastics might affect n2o emission during bnr process li et al 2020 han et al 2022 therefore the hypothesis that long term exposure to pet microplastics may significantly affect n2o turnovers during mainstream bnr process was proposed in this work in the coming text the effects of pet microplastics on nitrogen transformations and n2o turnovers during denitrification and nitrification were fully explored 3 2 insights into n2o turnovers under pet microplastics stress during denitrification as an example fig 2 a displayed the variations of no 3 no 2 and n2o in denitrification batch test 1 for the control reactor pet 0 μg l and others were presented in fig s3 according to these profiles and corresponding mlvss concentrations the maximum specific no 3 no 2 and n2o reduction rates were determined and summarized in fig 2b apparently with the increase of pet microplastics concentrations a declining trend of the maximum specific no 3 no 2 and n2o reduction rates was observed indicating the negative effects of pet microplastics on denitrification performance for all reactors the maximum specific reduction rates were in the order of n2o no 3 no 2 among them the maximum specific n2o reduction rate was most sensitive to pet microplastics with its value sharply decreasing from 82 6 0 2 mg n hr g vss at pet 0 μg l to 39 7 0 1 mg n hr g vss at pet 10 μg l decreased by 50 4 nevertheless a tiny decline was observed from 39 7 0 1 to 38 0 mg 0 1 n hr g vss among the experimental reactors pet 10 100 and 500 μg l fig 2b the variations of no 3 no 2 and n2o in denitrification batch test 2 for the control reactor were shown in fig 2c since the external carbon source was not sufficient for complete reduction of no 3 i e in situ conditions similar as parent reactors the no 3 reduction rate was relatively high in the first 20 min while no 3 was reduced very slowly from 20 to 120 min denoted as endogenous denitrification pan et al 2019 it can be seen that n2o accumulation occurred during the endogenous denitrification for all the reactors fig 2d among them control reactor was the first to start accumulating n2o at 27 min and its n2o concentration was also highest through the entire test experimental reactors started accumulating n2o slightly later with the latest time of 40 min for pet 500 μg l reactor moreover the n2o concentrations at 120 min for experimental reactors were 0 6 pet 10 μg l 0 4 pet 100 μg l and 0 3 pet 500 μg l mg n l respectively all of which were lower than that of control reactor 0 9 mg n l based on above batch tests it could be inferred that less n2o was produced during denitrification for the experimental reactors these results indicated that pet microplastics reduced both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification and n2o accumulation was also declined under pet microplastics stress notably these negative effects became stronger with the increase of pet microplastics concentration 3 3 insights into n2o production under pet microplastics stress during nitrification the activities of aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are usually assessed by the maximum specific nh 4 and no 2 oxidation rates respectively wang et al 2014 in fig 3 a no significant difference in the maximum specific nh 4 oxidation rates among the control and experimental reactors was observed with an average value of 8 3 0 3 mg n hr g vss however the maximum specific no 2 oxidation rate gradually increased from 9 5 0 8 mg n hr g vss in control reactor to 12 2 0 1 mg n hr g vss in pet 100 μg l reactor and then decreased to 11 0 0 3 mg n hr g vss in the pet 500 μg l reactor therefore aob was considered to be capable of tolerating pet microplastics ranging from 10 to 500 μg l whereas nob might be enhanced showing the highest activity at a pet microplastics concentration of 100 μg l as an example fig 3b showed the nh 4 do and n2o profiles in nitrification batch test 2 for the pet 500 μg l reactor and others were presented in fig s4 during the initial 15 min control phase n2o concentration remained constant at 0 ppmv suggesting no n2o produced by heterotrophic denitrification therefore the n2o production throughout the entire batch test came from nitrification and the effect of heterotrophic bacteria was negligible after the addition of nh 4 n2o concentration increased sharply within 8 min and then gradually declined during the entire experimental phase nh 4 concentration remained constantly at 12 8 0 3 mg n l a level almost same as the initial nh 4 concentration in parent reactors n2o efs were calculated according to the measured nh 4 n concentrations and added nh 4 n solution wang et al 2016a as shown in fig 3c the n2o profiles of all reactors showed very similar trends during the entire tests however the n2o production was apparently in the order of pet 0 μg l pet 10 μg l pet 100 μg l pet 500 μg l indicating that n2o production during nitrification was reduced with the increased pet microplastics concentrations the average n2o efs in different reactors during nitrification batch test 2 were 1 0 0 7 0 5 and 0 3 respectively p 0 05 fig 3d further suggesting that the n2o production during nitrification decreased as the presence of pet microplastics increased to further analyze the effects of pet microplastics on n2o production pathways during nitrification the n2o sps in each reactor were determined using an isotope analyzer results showed that sp values increased from 4 7 1 7 in control reactor to 14 7 2 2 in pet 100 μg l reactor and then slightly decreased to 13 9 2 1 in pet 500 μg l reactor fig s5 a rapid increase of sp values was observed from the control reactor to pet 10 μg l reactor indicating long term exposure to pet microplastics even at low level may change the n2o production pathways during nitrification fig 4 displayed the variations of relative contributions to n2o production under pet microplastics stress for the control reactor aob denitrification pathway played a dominant role with a relative contribution of 78 0 consistent with previous reports wunderlin et al 2012 peng et al 2014 as the pet microplastics level increasing from 0 to 100 μg l a decrease in the relative contribution of aob denitrification pathway from 78 0 to 45 1 was observed whereas the contribution by nh2oh oxidation pathway increased to 54 9 moreover the pet 500 μg l reactor had a slightly higher contribution for aob denitrification pathway in comparison to the pet 100 μg l reactor p 0 05 which might be owing to the decreased nob activity fig 3a and fig 6b it was confirmed that pet microplastics enhanced the specific no 2 oxidation rates but hardly affected nh 4 oxidation rates in the experimental reactors fig 3a therefore the generated no 2 may be quickly oxidized to no 3 rather than reduced to n2o via aob denitrification pathway resulting in lower relative contributions of aob denitrification pathway in the experimental reactors kim et al 2010 peng et al 2015 3 4 interaction between pet microplastics and bnr sludge to uncover the interaction between pet microplastics and bnr sludge the characteristic changes after long term exposure to pet microplastics were explored fig s6 displayed that svi increased from 47 4 1 2 ml g in control reactor to 62 4 1 5 ml g in pet 500 μg l reactor p 0 05 reflecting that the sludge settleability might be negatively affected under pet microplastics stress in fig 5 a the sludge particle sizes in the experimental reactors were significantly larger than that in control reactor with the medium particle diameter dv 0 5 increased by over 2 5 times from 77 1 2 1 μm to 199 4 8 μm previous studies reported microplastics could interact with organics and eps aggregation to form larger particles xu et al 2021 which was also observed by sem images in this work fig 5e besides the specific surface areas sharply decreased from 210 4 1 7 m2 kg in control reactor to 60 63 1 3 in pet 100 μg l reactor and 61 41 2 2 in pet 500 μg l reactor probably due to the increased particle sizes yuan et al 2021 fig 5b presented the variations of eps components after long term exposure to pet microplastics at different concentrations as pet microplastics concentrations increasing from 0 to 500 μg l protein and polysaccharide two main components of eps increased from 52 6 1 8 to 70 2 2 3 mg g vss and 5 5 0 7 to 11 1 1 0 mg g vss respectively which was also confirmed by the increased fluorescence intensities of 3d eem spectra fig s7 the higher fluorescence intensity of region ⅳ which represents the concentration of hydrophilic acids in the experimental reactors indicated that pet microplastics enhanced the hydrophilic performance of eps probably leading to worse sludge dewatering yuan et al 2021 the surface morphologies of pristine pet microplastics and activated sludge with or without long term exposure to pet microplastics 100 μg l were shown in fig 5c e the pristine pet microplastics had relatively smooth surfaces along with some debris generated during the manufacturing process fig 5c after long term operation the pet microplastics displayed much rougher surface and shrunken shapes accompanied with numerous holes fig 5e and fig s8 and the original debris was no longer observed on the microplastic surface because of the hydraulic shearing mahon et al 2017 in fig 5d a large number of cocci bacilli and eps aggregation as well as a few filamentous bacteria were observed for the sludge from control reactor similar microbial distributions were also found in the experimental reactor except that microplastics particles were entangled and wrapped by activated sludge fig 5e in the experimental reactor pet 100 μg l more eps secretion was due to the microbial protective mechanism following the occurrence of environmental stimuli i e protecting the bacterial activities from pet microplastics fig 5b fu et al 2022 however the abundant eps might increase sludge viscosity and promote sludge flocculation resulting in the potential adhesion and aggregation of activated sludge on the pet microplastics surface martinez et al 2004 wei et al 2020 besides the much rougher surface with emerging holes of pet microplastics after long term operation would increase their specific surface areas and facilitate organics adsorption e g eps fig 5e and fig s8 xu et al 2021 therefore more small size microplastics were embedded inside the sludge floc resulting in the sharply increased sludge particle size in the experimental reactor indeed the bnr process is usually completed by a series of electron transfer and consumption among functional oxidoreductases and substrates such sludge morphology might prevent the nutrient matrix delivery and electron transfer in the experimental reactor wei et al 2020 chen et al 2021 due to the limited substrate load i e external carbon source inside the experimental sludge floc intensified electron competition occurred among various reductases during denitrification nevertheless the competitive no 3 reductase would preferentially obtain electrons therefore both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification decreased under pet microplastics stress fig 2 liu et al 2018 for nitrification process the increase in particle size of activated sludge usually resulted in higher n2o production liu et al 2020 duan et al 2021 the opposite results from this work indicated the key factor in reducing n2o production during nitrification was the reshaped microbial community rather than the changed sludge morphology on the one hand the enhanced nob activity in the experimental reactors could reduce no 2 accumulation and thus reduce n2o production during nitrification fig 3 peng et al 2015 on the other hand the significantly increased microbial richness and diversity under pet microplastics stress might play an important role in reducing n2o production since the n2o production capacities vary greatly among different microorganisms fig 6 and fig s9 ren et al 2019 which also provided a reasonable explanation for the difference in n2o production between the pet 500 µg l reactor and pet 10 µg l reactor fig 3 in the future further in depth analyses e g genomics and proteomics are required to reveal the underlying relationship between n2o production and microbial community moreover the larger sludge particle size and irregular surface of pet microplastics in the experimental reactor provided more anaerobic microenvironment inside the sludge flocs it was a reasonable explanation for the enhanced microbial diversity particularly denitrifiers in experimental reactor fig 6b although anaerobic microenvironment might be favorable to denitrification the sharp decline in the relative abundance of dominant denitrifiers i e thauera would significantly reduce denitrification rates fig 6b 3 5 effects of pet microplastics on the microbial community and nitrogen metabolism the effects of long term exposure to pet microplastics 0 500 μg l on microbial community were analyzed the rarefaction curves of four samples demonstrated that the whole microbial species were effectively captured and the sequencing results were reasonable fig s9a the alpha diversity metrics was used to evaluate the microbial richness and diversity as shown in fig s9b the control reactor obviously had the lowest values of simpson 0 87 shannon 5 09 and chao 245 indexes and no significant difference of the three indexes among experimental reactors was observed these results reflected that tiny amounts of pet microplastics 10 μg l could increase the richness and diversity of microorganisms in mainstream bnr reactors and this potential impact did not become much stronger even at the level of pet 500 μg l a recent study also found that the microbial diversity of ags were increased after the addition of 0 5 g l pes microplastics qin et al 2020 furthermore the number of common otus 118 was 15 6 of the total otus in four reactors 759 suggesting the severe effects of pet microplastics on microbial community fig s10 the distributions of microbial community at phylum level were displayed in fig 6a proteobacteria bacteroidota nitrospirota myxococcota and acidobacteriota were the dominant phylum in all reactors accounting for 89 7 93 3 of the total bacterial sequences among them proteobacteria consisting of various bacteria related to the removal of nitrogen phosphorus and cod qin et al 2020 decreased from 69 6 in control reactor to 49 1 average value in experimental reactors bacteroidota was reported to be associated with the degradation of polymers and complex organic substances zhang et al 2017 the significantly increased relative abundances of bacteroidota indicated that biological degradation of pet microplastics might occur in the experimental reactors which provided a reasonable explanation for the rough surface and numerous holes of pet microplastics after long term operation fig 5e and fig s8 in addition the relative abundances of nitrospirota and acidobacteriota in experimental reactors were also much higher in comparison to the control reactor fig 6a these results revealed that pet microplastics had reshaped the microbial community by positively or negatively affecting the abundances of dominant phylum the main functional species involved in denitrification and nitrification were further analyzed at genus level as shown in fig 6b thauera was the dominant denitrifier in all reactors which was attributed to the carbon source consisting of glucose and sodium acetate ren et al 2019 with the increase in pet microplastics concentrations the relative abundance of thauera decreased from 12 9 to 8 3 indicating the negative impacts of pet microplastics moreover the declined abundance of thauera would lead to less n2o production ren et al 2019 the relative abundance of rhodobacter decreased sharply from 3 3 in control reactor to 0 5 average value in experimental reactors previous studies reported that rhodobacter was highly associated with n2o emission and nirk gene expression thereby leading to no 2 accumulation fig 1 vieira et al 2019 on the contrary the relative abundances of dokdonella denitifiers associated with the reduction of no 3 and no 2 zhou et al 2022 and unclassified saprospiraceae denitifiers associated with the degradation of organic compounds mao et al 2022 increased after long term exposure to pet microplastics suggesting their high resistant to pet microplastics in addition some emerging denitrifiers with low abundances were found in experimental reactors such as dechloromonas 0 1 0 6 hyphomicrobium 0 1 0 2 and sulfuritalea 0 2 0 4 wang et al 2016b 2021 further demonstrating the enhanced microbial diversity under pet microplastics stress table s1 as for nitrifiers the relative abundance of nitrosomonas increased from 0 7 in control reactor to 1 1 in pet 100 μg l reactor it was reported that n2o produced by nitrosomonas mainly came from nh2oh oxidation pathway ren et al 2019 providing a reasonable explanation for the increased relative contribution of nh2oh oxidation pathway in this work fig 4 nitrospira is closely related to no 2 oxidation during nitrification and its relative abundance showed same changing trend as the maximum no 2 oxidation rate fig 6b and fig 3 further confirming pet microplastics enhanced nob activity bian et al 2020 these results also indicated that nitrifiers were basically tolerant of the long term exposure of pet microplastics 10 500 μg l in addition the enrichment of comammox nitrospira an organism performing complete ammonia oxidation to no 2 without n2o production may occur in the high abundance of nitrospira sp environment roots et al 2019 which may be a putative reason for the decreased n2o production during nitrification in experimental reactors fig 3 whether long term exposure to pet microplastics resulted in the occurrence of comammox nitrospira needs further investigation in the future to further obtain the significant changes of molecular functions of bacteria under pet microplastics stress phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust2 was used for the prediction of the nitrogen metabolism pathways during bnr process fig 6c which was based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database cui et al 2019 four nitrogen micro transformations i e denitrification nitrification dissimilatory assimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrogen fixation were involved and no anammox enzymes represented by ec 1 7 2 7 was observed table s2 in this study the relative abundances of functional enzymes genes were used to evaluate the capability of nitrogen metabolism for example in the denitrification pathway the no 3 reductases represented by ec 1 7 99 1 k00374 and k02568 and ec 1 9 6 1 k02567 decreased from 4 8 at pet 0 μg l level to 4 1 at pet 10 μg l level the reductases of no 2 and no had similar changing profiles with the no 3 reductases particularly the no reductases represented by ec 1 7 2 5 k04561 were reduced by almost half from 7 0 at pet 0 μg l level to 3 5 at pet 10 μg l level indicating that the functional genes expressions and no reductases activities were negatively affected under pet microplastics stress the n2o reductases i e n2o reduction capacities showed no significant changes among control and experimental reactors as a result less n2o emissions were measured in experimental reactors figs 1 3 in addition the genes of nxr reflecting the no 2 oxidation during nitrification were much more abundant in experimental reactors 16 7 17 1 than those in control reactor 11 0 it should be noted that these functional enzymes changed slightly with the increased concentrations of pet microplastics 10 500 μg l consistent with the results of microbial community composition and diversity fig 6 these results further demonstrated the effects of pet microplastics on nitrogen metabolism including n2o turnovers at the gene level 3 6 overall understandings and implications recently the ubiquitous microplastics have attracted great attention especially for their impacts on microbial metabolism in biological wastewater treatment however few studies were available to explore the effects of microplastics on n2o turnovers in mainstream bnr process which is closely related to the greenhouse effect and biogeochemical cycle this work confirmed that both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification were reduced under pet microplastics stress even at environmental level i e 10 μg l as well as the n2o production during nitrification for the first time it was revealed that the contributions from heterotrophic bacteria pathway and aob denitrification pathway to n2o production were negatively affected by pet microplastics whereas the contribution from nh2oh pathway was positively enhanced the following two reasons were revealed to be closely related to the significant effects of pet microplastics on n2o turnovers in mainstream bnr process on one side the remarkable increase of sludge particle size via the interaction between pet microplastics and bnr sludge led to an intensified electron competition among various reductases thereby reducing n2o production and reduction during denitrification because of the absolute competitiveness of no 3 reductase chen et al 2021 on the other side pet microplastics not only altered the eps characteristics of the bnr sludge but also reshaped the microbial community and nitrogen metabolism pathway particularly the denitrifiers e g thauera and rhodobacter highly associated with n2o emission and the nirk gene expressions were both decreased resulting in more no 2 accumulation during denitrification fig 1 the representative nob nitrospirota had much higher abundance under pet microplastics stress corresponding to the increased no 2 oxidation rate fig 3 which thus inhibited aob denitrification pathway and the resulting n2o production during nitrification fig 4 in addition the significant changes of eps production of the bnr sludge induced by pet microplastics also reflected the changes of microbial activity above results demonstrated that the negative effects of pet microplastics on mainstream bnr at wwtps would already occur but was previously ignored due to the inadequate assessment methods and emission standards despite growing calls for more effective management of plastic products to reduce microplastics sources it is unfortunately not possible at present to control the microplastics in municipal wastewater at negligible level most of the microplastics in wastewater would be captured by activated sludge wei et al 2021 therefore microplastics can accumulate to a significant extent in activated sludge system after long term operation because they can only be removed with the sludge purging the implications of this work would help to comprehensively understand the role of microplastics in biological wastewater treatment and thus develop targeted strategies to further mitigate n2o emission under pet microplastics stress in mainstream bnr process previous strategies e g enhance aeration which mainly focused on inhibiting aob denitrification pathway to achieve n2o mitigation may not be suitable for the current wastewater with emerging microplastics since nh2oh oxidation pathway rather than aob denitrification played a dominant role in n2o production under microplastics stress fig 4 as confirmed previously do have a positive effect on the n2o production via nh2oh oxidation pathway thus an appropriate do should be controlled during aerobic period to promote n2o mitigation in bnr under microplastics stress in addition the findings of the relevance of n2o contributing pathways with microplastics from this work provided new insights for possibly modifying the current n2o models to capture the microplastics induced effects on n2o turnovers in order to accurately predict n2o emission from the bnr process under the microplastics stress 4 conclusion this is the first work to reveal the potential effect and underlying mechanism of long term exposure to pet microplastics on n2o turnovers during mainstream bnr process the main conclusions were as follows 1 pet microplastics had no significant effect on nh 4 removal but reduced tn removal efficiency nitrification was hardly affected while denitrification rates decreased under pet microplastics stress besides the comparable n2o efs in experimental reactors were mainly attributed to more no 2 accumulation in anoxic period rather than the tolerance to pet microplastics 2 pet microplastics reduced both production and reduction of n2o during denitrification and the n2o accumulation within 120 min decreased from 0 9 to 0 3 mg n l with the increase of pet microplastics 3 the n2o production during nitrification was also reduced by 30 70 under pet microplastics stress while the relative contribution of aob denitrification pathway decreased from 78 0 to 45 1 because of the enhanced no 2 oxidation rate 4 pet microplastics even at environmental level i e 10 μg l significantly increased sludge particle size and eps secretion as well as reshaped microbial community by increasing microbial diversity and affecting bacterial
