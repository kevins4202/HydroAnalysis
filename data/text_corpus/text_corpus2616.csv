13080,experimental and computational approaches were employed to model kinetics of volatile solids destruction in the presence of water evaporation during biological digestion of wastewater sludge water evaporation occurred in both anaerobic and aerobic laboratory digesters with a much higher intensity in the latter the water evaporation followed a linear trend over time by inclusion of the linear equation for water evaporation rate new kinetic models were developed to predict volatile solids vs and volatile suspended solids vss concentrations of batch biological digesters modelled results using a first order model were in good agreement with the measured vs concentrations of the anaerobic reactors operated at 35 c and 55 c and 55 with coefficients of determination r2 0 92 and 0 84 respectively vs degradation of and 55 was slightly more consistent with zero order kinetics r2 0 86 vs and vss concentrations measured for batch aerobic digesters also agreed with the first order model r2 values were 0 91 0 75 and 0 99 for reactors operated at 35 c ad 35 45 c and 55 c respectively as for the progression in terms of vss concentration the highest r2 and lowest sum of squared error values belonged to ad 35 this is the first study that developed kinetic models for simultaneous vs degradation and water evaporation under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the outcomes of this study indicate that water evaporation needs to be considered for accurate determination of the kinetic rate constant and solids reduction in laboratory and full scale sludge digesters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords evaporation digestion kinetics sludge anaerobic aerobic 1 introduction sludge is a by product of wastewater treatment and needs to be treated due to the high volatile solids vs content of wastewater sludge some sludge treatment processes need to focus on vs reduction to achieve sludge stabilization biological digestion of sludge which can be done aerobically and anaerobically plays a key role in attaining vs reduction at wastewater treatment plants 1 2 both processes are carried out in reactors that can operate at various temperatures aerobic sludge digesters can be operated at ambient and thermophilic temperatures during which the temperature of the digesting content may reach 65 c 1 most anaerobic digesters are designed to work at 35 c and some are designed to work at around 55 c water evaporation is not typically considered in anaerobic digesters however since the retention time of sludge in the reactors is usually high i e 20 days appreciable water evaporation might occur during anaerobic digestion considering the high water content of sludge this would result in a significant mass loss biogas produced by anaerobic digesters may be partially recirculated inside the reactor to provide mixing 2 3 which is a particularly important parameter for both anaerobic and aerobic processes to succeed 1 4 also aerobic digesters are aerated to provide the oxygen required for aerobic biodegradation the aeration and gas mixing can intensify the escape of water from the digesters 5 7 unlike the case of anaerobic digestion numerous researchers have reported substantial water evaporation during aerobic digestion 8 13 although no measured value for evaporation rate was reported the issue was dealt with in several ways liu et al 12 let the evaporated water escape ginnivan et al 10 used moist air for aerobic digestion and mentioned that water losses due to evaporation were negligible jang et al 13 installed a condenser to return the escaped water back to the reactor moreover daily addition of deionized water to the reactor to compensate for water that is lost to evaporation has been in practice for a long time 11 14 16 nonetheless the addition of water to a reactor especially with long intervals may impact the reactor chemistry microbial populations and process kinetics these concerns also apply to anaerobic digestion thence knowledge of evaporation during sludge digestion is important to have a realistic understanding of process efficiency while solids destruction reduces solids concentration evaporation increases it equations to describe reaction kinetics link the progression of the reaction with the concentration of the reacting constituent 17 depending on the kinetics of solids destruction the effect of evaporation may differ there has been some research that focused on vs destruction and process modelling in aerated composting where water evaporation and vs destruction occur simultaneously 18 22 nevertheless the properties of the sludge fed into biological sludge digesters are very different from those used as feed for composting processes due to the significance of water evaporation it should be factored in the kinetic modelling of solids destruction during digestion of wastewater sludge this can have great implications for the design of digesters nevertheless the link between water evaporation and solids destruction kinetics during wastewater sludge digestion has not yet been addressed in the relevant literature therefore the current study is an endeavor to determine how significant the water evaporation is and subsequently develop a kinetic model of solids destruction that accounts for the water evaporation during anaerobic and aerobic digestion of wastewater sludge such models would more accurately predict volatile solids concentration of digested sludge for laboratory and full scale digesters 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale digester primary sludge ps thickened waste activated sludge t was and digested sludge ds were sampled from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in ottawa canada at the plant the incoming municipal wastewater is treated by a conventional activated sludge process followed by the chemical precipitation of phosphorus a full scale anaerobic digester is part of the wwtp according to the operation team of the wwtp the anaerobic digester consists of two groups completely mixed flow reactors cmfr in series while the reactors of each group are in parallel the first group receiving the feed sludge is operated at 37 c for better removal of pathogens the second group is operated at 41 c mixed ps and t was are fed into the digesters via two separate pipes and the volumetric ratio of ps to t was is roughly 4 5 measurements showed that the ratio of volatile solids vs to total solids ts of ps remained relatively constant 0 82 0 87 over time sludge samples of different sizes were collected from the wwtp depending on the purpose of sampling small sample sizes up to 1 l were cooled by ice packs right after sampling because they were used for measuring sensitive parameters such as solids content and ph large sample sizes 10 30 l were used for laboratory digestion experiments in less than three hours they were transferred to the laboratory and refrigerated 2 2 laboratory digesters three batch anaerobic reactors were made of 10 l working volume nalgene containers they were operated at 35 45 and 55 c which are hereafter called and 35 and 45 and and 55 respectively heating was provided by warmers blankets wrapped around the containers the warmers were connected to a temperature control system which had a temperature sensor submerged into the reactor during the digestion process an air lock was installed at the exhaust of the reactor to prevent contact between the reactor headspace and ambient air and to maintain water evaporation at manageable levels the batch aerobic digestion experiment was conducted at the same temperatures after the completion of the batch anaerobic digestion experiment the same reactors were modified by the addition of vapor condensers to mitigate the expected large water evaporation during aerobic digestion the condensers consisted of a copper tube at the centre coiled by a hose carrying cold water the condensers were installed between the gas exhaust and air lock of the reactors hereafter the three aerobic digesters operated at 35 45 and 55 c are called ad 35 ad 45 and ad 55 respectively aeration of aerobic reactors was made possible by transferring pressurized air into the reactor and distributing the transported air through a diffuser the pressurized air was filtered before being injected into the diffuser so far various flow rates and methods have been employed for air injection into aerobic digesters 11 12 23 27 this variability is understandable considering reactors of different types and sizes were employed in the cited papers to calculate the amount of oxygen required for the present work the following assumptions were made oxidizable organic matter had a chemical formula of c5h7o2n 1 with the concentration of 40 g l initial ammonia concentration was 50 mg l all the organic matter and ammonia initial and produced during digestion would be fully oxidized mineralized by the end of the experiment the assumed initial concentrations of oxidizable organic matter and ammonia were based on preliminary tests with the above assumptions and using a safety factor of four the applied airflow rate was determined to be about 140 ml min the assembled reactors and the accessories were secured on an orbital plate shaker for the anaerobic digesters the mixing intensity of the shaker was initially set at 140 rpm rpm which was reduced to 115 rpm after 3 days for the aerobic digesters the mixing intensity of the shaker was set at 90 10 rpm further details of the laboratory reactors are depicted in schematics shown in fig 1 a and b and pictures shown in figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary information si influent sludge of the full scale digester was prepared in the laboratory by mixing ps and t was with the same ratio as at the treatment plant the same influent sludge was used as the feed of batch reactors to which inoculum was added the mass fractions of the components of the reactor content were 0 74 0 16 and 0 1 for ps t was and inoculum respectively fig 2 illustrates the steps taken for conducting batch anaerobic and aerobic digestion the inocula of the anaerobic batch reactors ds from the full scale reactor were acclimatized in the same reactors in a separate run of digestion experiments with a mixture of ps and t was as feed at their respective temperatures the inoculum prepared for and 35 in the laboratory was found to be acidic consequently the aforementioned reactor was inoculated with digested sludge from the full scale anaerobic digester which was already acclimatized to the feed of batch digesters i e ps t was in the case of aerobic batch digesters the aerobic bacteria of t was would be the inoculum therefore acclimatization was achieved by running the aerobic digesters containing ps as feed and t was as inoculum to be acclimatized at their respective temperatures sludge samples were taken from the batch digesters throughout the digestion process to measure the parameters of interest 2 3 measurement of sludge solids total solids ts and fixed solids fs concentrations were determined thermally by heating sludge at 104 c for 24 h and 550 c for 2 h respectively volatile solids vs concentration was calculated as the difference between the two in this text square brackets denote concentration in g kg the measurements of ts vs and fs started on the same day of sampling and the measurements were done in triplicate ts mass fraction fts sl was calculated by dividing ts by 1000 where the index sl denotes sludge and this applies to all other relevant parameters of this article the total water mass fraction ftw sl of sludge was calculated by 1 fts sl to obtain sludge filtrate sludge samples were centrifuged at 14 000g for 1 h the supernatant was then filtered through a membrane with a pore diameter of 0 45 μm the filtrate was used to measure the concentration of the dissolved species supernatant and filtrate mass fractions were considered to be the same the work for acquiring the filtrate was carried out on the same day as sludge sampling and the obtained filtrate was stored in the fridge at 1 4 c until further analyses total dissolved solids tds and fixed dissolved solids fds concentrations were measured by heating the sludge filtrate at 104 c for 24 h and 550 c for 2 h respectively the concentration of volatile dissolved solids vds in the liquid phase was calculated by subtracting fds concentration from tds the measurements done in triplicate were carried out one day after sludge sampling day tds sl vds sl and fds sl were calculated by multiplying the corresponding filtrate concentration by ftw sl this was then used to compute concentration of suspended solids as follows tss ts tds sl vss vs vds sl fss fs fds sl note that average values were used for these calculations 2 4 measurement of sludge characteristics chemical oxygen demand cod and reactive phosphorus were measured by colorimetric methods using a dr 2800 spectrophotometer hach high range plus and high range cod reagents hach method 8000 were used for measuring total cod tcod and soluble cod scod high range molybovandate reagent hach method 8114 was used to measure reactive phosphorus the accuracy of the spectrophotometer and reagents was confirmed by measuring the concentration of the parameters in calibration standards the measurements were at least duplicated the following parameters were measured using specific hach probes ph orion 9157b thermo scientific oxidation reduction potential orp intellical mtc101 hach electrical conductivity ec inlabr730 mettler toledo dissolved oxygen do rdo orion 087003 thermo scientific total ammonia nitrogen tan intellical iseh3181 hach and nitrate intellical iseno 3181 hach the probes were calibrated before the start and during the digestion experiments the measurements were carried out immediately after sampling characteristics of the influent and digestate of full scale anaerobic digesters have been tabulated and shown in tables 1 and 2 2 5 measurement and estimation of evaporation rate the batch reactors were filled with 10 kg water and heated at the same temperatures as those applied for sludge digestion experiments mass of empty reactors was measured just before the start of the test and mass of the water only containing reactors was measured during evaporation periods once measured water mass was plotted versus evaporation time s3 a c in si the slope of the plot was the measured evaporation rate revap by conducting mass balance on the data collected from the batch digesters during the digestion experiments revap was estimated to determine whether evaporation rates in water only and sludge containing reactors were the same due to piping and electrical connections it was not possible to measure the mass of the sludge containing reactors during the digestion process nonetheless the masses of initial sludge just before digestion and final sludge at the end of digestion were measured additionally the mass of each sludge sample taken during the digestion experiments was also measured the corresponding water masses were calculated by multiplying the sludge mass by ftw sl the water mass loss due to evaporation is equal to the difference between total water mass loss and the water mass loss due to sampling during the experiment in other words if there was no evaporation the total water mass loss would have to be the same as water mass loss due to the sampling to compute the estimated water evaporation rate the mass of water lost to evaporation was then divided by the time interval within which evaporation took place this time period was in fact the duration of sludge digestion in the batch experiments the above description is formulated by eq 1 where i and f mean initial and final respectively the number of sludge sample is denoted by a and m is mass in this formulation the evaporation rate was considered to be constant with respect to evaporation time which was based on the water evaporation plots obtained from the water only tests as shown in fig s3 a and c in si 1 r evap m sl i f tw sl i a 1 a f m sl sam a f tw sam sl a m sl f f tw sl f t 2 6 kinetic modelling of vs destruction the governing equation used for the kinetic modelling eq 2 is the general expression of mass balance for a reactor crittenden et al 2012 2 vs b m sl t vs b in m in vs b ds m ds k n vs b n m sl where in means influent sludge and ṁ denotes mass flow rate total amount of volatile solids fraction is a summation of its biodegradable vsb and non biodegradable vsnonb parts vs

t k n vs b n m sl first order kinetic equations have been frequently used to model the destruction of volatile matter during anaerobic digestion 30 31 and aerobic digestion 27 32 therefore n can be considered to be 1 and eq 4 holds 4 vs b m sl t k 1 vs b m sl assuming a linear water mass loss over evaporation time the mass of water at any given time can be calculated using eq 5 considering the very small amount of destructible matter in the sludge mass loss of sludge during digestion is mainly due to evaporation thus eq 6 holds 5 m w t m w 0 r evap t 6 m sl t m sl 0 r evap t substitution of eq 6 into eq 4 yields eq 7 which can be simplified as eq 8 7 vs b m sl 0 r evap t t k 1 vs b m sl 0 r evap t 8 d vs b vs b dt k 1 r evap m sl 0 r evap t eq 8 can be rearranged and integrated over a time period to solve for vs at any given time the analytical solution to eq 8 is eq 9 the same approach can be used to find an expression eq 10 for vss in which case vss vsssol vsnonsol here the indices sol and nonsol denote solubilizable and insolubilizable respectively note that the kinetic rate constant in this case would be specific to solubilization or solids liquefaction k1 sol which is

carried out using the solver function of excel software to obtain the best fit a trade off was made between a low value for the sum of squared error sse and a high value for the coefficient of determination r2 in addition reduced mean squared error rmse values were calculated to further check the model s goodness of fit 3 results and discussion 3 1 water evaporation rate fig s3 a shows the change in water mass due to evaporation from the water only containing anaerobic reactors without aeration and without air lock installed the loss of water mass was linear over time the slopes of the linear fits of the evaporation rates are shown in table 1 under such conditions evaporation rates were proportional to the reactor temperatures with air locks installed fig s3 b however there was no evaporation from the water only containing anaerobic reactors at the end of the digestion experiments mass balance calculations were conducted to calculate the evaporation rate for each reactor table 3 it can be seen that the estimated evaporation rates were not directly proportional to the applied temperatures the estimated evaporation rates of and 35 and 55 were almost zero and that of and 45 was 0 04 kg d the measured and estimated evaporation rates table 3 were quite consistent for the and 35 and 55 and ad 35 45 and 55 evaporative reduction of water mass in the aerated water only containing aerobic reactors is depicted in fig s3 c in this configuration the evaporation rate was proportional to the applied temperature the evaporation test for ad 55 ended at day 20 because almost all the water initially added to the reactor had evaporated by that time in line with this the sludge content of the same reactor had dried after about 23 days after the start of the aerobic digestion experiment in cases where water evaporation was observed the curves are perfectly linear meaning evaporation rates did not change with time nor did they alter with a change in mass of water remaining in the reactors the estimated evaporation of water from and 45 would cause a maximum 10 increase in the measured concentration of vs on the last day of the digestion as the estimated evaporation rate was not supported by the corresponding result from the water only evaporation test kinetic modelling for and 45 was conducted for both scenarios i e with and without water evaporation 3 2 anaerobic digestion trends of ph and do concentration of the batch anaerobic digesters are shown in fig s4 a and b respectively variations of ts and fs concentrations in the same reactors are depicted in fig s5 a and b respectively model fittings using first order kinetics and the corresponding experimental data are shown in fig 3 a the model parameters and goodness of fit are presented in s6 the first order model fits the experimental data from and 35 the best sse 6 38 and r2 0 92 it can be seen that the poorest fit belongs to and 45 sse 63 4 and r2 0 68 the results of kinetic modelling of and 45 vs destruction with and without water evaporation were the same in terms of all model parameters except for the rate constant which was 16 higher for the case with evaporation as for and 55 the first order kinetic model could fairly describe the trend of vs destruction the computed rate constant for and 35 is within the range found for activated sludge hydrolysis 30 33 and methane production 34 rate constants at mesophilic temperatures from the data presented in table s 6 vs b 0 of and 35 is calculated to be only 29 of vs which is questionable an explanation could be the inactivity of bacteria due to the low ph levels of and 35 see fig s4 a in line with this perspective yan et al 35 showed that the efficiency of vs reduction decreased with decreasing initial ph level from 8 to 6 5 during anaerobic digestion of slaughterhouse sludge at 35 c the higher performance of and 45 than and 55 might be related to the better adaptability of the microorganisms to their physical and chemical conditions the poor fit of the kinetic model to the and 45 fig 1 a data is to a large extent because of an outlier concentration measured at day 12 of digestion hao et al 36 fitted vss concentrations obtained from 10 day hydrolysis of was at 50 c to a first order kinetic model the r squared values of this study were between 0 8692 and 0 9760 on the other hand a linear relationship was established by lin and chou 24 when they aerobically digested septage in a cmfr at ambient temperature furthermore zhang et al 37 observed a fairly linear removal versus time trend when they digested t was likewise the trend of datapoints obtained from measured vs values of and 55 of the current investigation did not seem to be perfectly following first order kinetics although there was a smooth downward trend thus a zero order kinetic model for the batch reactor was worked out as formulated by eqs 11 and 12 11 d vs b m sl t k 0 m sl 12 d vs b dt vs b r evap m sl 0 r evap t k 0 once eq 12 is integrated eq 13 is obtained 13 vs t vs b 0 vs nonb k 0 t 2 m sl 0 r evap t 2 m sl 0 2 r evap t considering the evaporation rate for the reactor was zero eq 13 is simplified to eq 14 14 vs t vs b 0 vs nonb k 0 t the model fitting is shown in fig 3 b and parameters of model goodness are provided in table s6 by comparing sse rmse and r2 values of the first order model with those of the zero order model one could come to the conclusion that the latter was more capable of describing the vs destruction trend in and 55 total and fixed solids concentrations of ps t was and ds sampled from the plants were plotted against time in fig 3 c d and e respectively the measured solids concentration of the sludge samples obtained from the plant showed in spite of large fluctuations in the vs concentration of the influent components fig 3 c and d vs concentration of the digested sludge remained relatively constant fig 3 e by using the data shown in fig 3 c e kinetic rate constants of the full scale anaerobic digester of the wwtp can be calculated for the time period over which sludge samples were collected according to the information received from the wwtp srt was estimated to be 30 days which may be long enough for significant water evaporation the logarithmic term on the right hand side of eqs 9 and 10 indeed represents a concentration factor equal to msl 0 msl t for a continuous flow reactor this would be expressed as influent to digested sludge mass flow rate the digested sludge mass flow rate can be calculated using eq 15 the actual vs concentration vs act of the influent is equal to the measured concentration vs meas times the concentration factor as shown by eq 16 because the full scale digester was operated with only one srt and the laboratory batch reactors were not expected to simulate the reactivity of vs in the full scale digester its vsnonb cannot be known in the present study therefore the measured vs concentrations of the influent and digested sludge were used for computing k1 values the calculated values might not be precise they can be rather called observed rate constants their trend over time however could reflect that of actual k1 values the full scale reactor of the current study was a cmfr for the most part but the last compartment connected to the previous reactors in series would constitute a plug flow reactor pfr therefore incorporation of the water evaporation term is carried out for both types of hydraulic regimes under steady state conditions general solutions to eq 2 for ideal cmfr and pfr with first order reactions are eqs 17 and 18 38 substitution of eq 16 into eqs 17 and 18 and solving for k1 yields eqs 19 and 20 respectively 15 m ds m in r evap srt 16 vs in act m ds r evap srt m i n vs in meas 17 vs

srt with the same influent and digested sludge concentrations for cmfr and pfr k1 values are different for the two types of reactors eqs 19 and 20 were used to estimate rate constants of the full scale anaerobic digester the evaporation rate measured for water only batch reactors without air lock operated at 35 c was initially used to estimate kinetic rate constants for this purpose the results are plotted against time in fig 3 f calculations showed that even the highest evaporation rate measured in the laboratory does not have any effect on the rate constants of the full scale anaerobic digester this would not mean that the evaporation rate in the full scale anaerobic digester was as low as the ones determined in the batch anaerobic digesters since the reactor configuration in the wwtp was understandably very different from the laboratory digesters further calculations were done assuming much higher evaporation rates the calculations showed that at a water evaporation rate of 1000 kg d rate constants of vs destruction could be 30 higher than those calculated under the no evaporation condition regardless of the evaporation rate and the kinetic model used the rate constants varied over time this could happen due to the alteration of the sludge reactivity over time zhao and viraraghavan 39 assumed such a change to be a function of influent vs concentration this assumption was proved to be the case for the hydrolysis rate constant of vss at 50 c when hao et al 36 observed an increase in the rate constant with increasing initial vss concentration another explanation for the varying rate constant would be the changes that might have happened due to the inoculum to substrate ratio 29 3 3 aerobic digestion trends of ph and do concentration of the batch anaerobic digesters are shown in fig s7 a and b respectively variations of ts and fs concentrations of the same reactors are depicted in fig s8 a and b respectively the experimental and modelled trends of vs concentration for batch aerobic digesters are shown in fig 4 a further details of modelling results are outlined in table s9 as expected the first order kinetic model was able to simulate the trend established by experimental data the model described ad 35 trend better than ad 45 and 55 in the case of ad 45 and 55 vs concentration increased over time in actuality the predicted values for vs concentrations of ad 55 on days 15 and 20 were off by 17 and 20 respectively examination of the vs content of the aerobic digesters of the current studies showed that the ad 35 45 and 55 achieved 48 2 39 7 and 14 4 vs reductions respectively using autothermal aerobic digestion for 360 and 554 h liu et al 12 25 reduced vs content by about 40 jang et al 2019 observed 60 4 reduction in vs after 360 h of aerobic digestion at 55 c compared to the reductions cited the thermophilic aerobic digesters of the current study did not perform as expected but this could be due to the differences in sludge characteristics jang et al 26 27 reported significantly different vs reductions for two different types of sludges that were digested in the same reactors under the same conditions non biodegradable vs content accounted for 50 4 51 9 and 54 8 of volatile solids in the undigested feed sludge of aerobic digesters table s9 these values are higher than 42 2 reported by lin and chou 24 the study in which septage sludge was aerobically digested on the other hand from the data presented by kavitha et al 32 vsnonb vs of a was can be estimated to be about 92 for a digester operating at room temperature the decrease in vs reduction with increasing temperature seems counter intuitive as one would expect to see otherwise one reason could be the errors in the sampling and measurement of solids content in ad 45 and 55 on the final day these errors were more likely to happen towards the end of the experiments due to the higher solids concentration of sludge and related difficulties in taking uniform and homogenous samples the coefficient of determination for the first order models describing vs degradation during aerobic digestion was found to be 0 98 at room temperature 24 greater than 0 988 at 35 c 45 c and 55 c 40 0 986 at room temperature 32 and 0 97 at 55 c 27 the r squared value determined for ad 55 is within the range of the figures cited but those of ad 35 and 45 are not dissolved solids concentrations fig s10 a and b were subtracted from their respective total solids concentrations fig s8 a and b to determine the suspended solids concentrations of the batch aerobic digesters as depicted in figs 4 b and s10 d and e since vss is a fraction of vs it would be interesting to see how well the models fit vss concentration values of the aerobic sludge digesters the experimental and simulated results are shown in fig 4 b the details of modelling results are displayed in table s11 in the case of ad 35 and 45 the r2 values for the vss model fittings table s11 were higher than those for the vs model fittings table s9 while the corresponding sse values for the vss model fittings table s11 of ad 35 and 45 were lower than those for the vs model fittings table s9 in the case of ad 55 on the other hand the r2 value of vss model fitting was lower than that of vs while the situation with respect to comparing the sse values was the other way around tables s11 and s9 non solubilizable vss contents of the feeds were 44 8 42 6 and 41 7 for ad 35 45 and 55 respectively table s11 from the data presented by bhargava and datar 15 vssnonsol vss of the undigested feed sludge of a digester can be estimated to be about 64 this value has been calculated based on the reported vss contents of the initial sludge and the sludge sample taken after 28 days of aerobic digestion at 30 c vs mass reductions were calculated to be 48 2 39 7 and 14 4 whereas vss mass reductions were calculated to be 52 5 46 2 and 19 5 for ad 35 45 and 55 respectively this indicates that solubilization of volatile solids content occurred to a considerably larger extent than complete mineralization did based on the results reported by bhargava and datar 15 vss reductions during a set of aerobic digestions were as follows 45 6 at 30 c after 15 d 40 7 at 45 c after 13 d 34 9 at 55 c after 15 d and 38 2 at 60 c after 15 d a study on thermophilic aerobic digestion showed a vss reduction of about 34 3 where the hydraulic regime was cmfr and srt was gradually reduced from 4 to 1 day during the process 41 furthermore it has been demonstrated that vss removal depends on initial vss concentration 8 9 an important note about the modelling approach presented in the current study is the estimation of the evaporation rate of sludge during digestion due to high evaporation solids concentration increased during the process in ad 45 and 55 and even the nature of solids would have undergone significant changes at least in terms of vs content the evaporation rate might be affected by the affinity of solids for water or lack thereof this would mean there could be cases where the evaporation rate would change during digestion even under isothermal conditions results of nebiker 42 are in line with this perspective where sludge drying in the open air was studied notwithstanding the models developed for vs and vss using constant water evaporation rate in the present study can at least predict the vs and vss trends correctly an explanation is that the sludge moisture content did not reach a critical point where the effect of water particle interaction on evaporation would become a dominant factor therefore the experimental approach utilized in the current study to measure the evaporation rate is considered appropriate it was expected to see a difference between the fittings for vs and vss of the aerobic digestion experiments for three reasons the first reason is the number of data points vss having one less data point because suspended solids concentration was not measured on sludge samples taken on day 3 the second reason is unlike vs degradation solubilization vss does not mean a complete breakdown and eventual conversion into mineral species also the value of solubilizable vss concentration at any given time could be smaller larger or equal to that of biodegradable vs concentration liu et al 40 determined k1 values of 0 00069 d 1 0 00097 d 1 and 0 00111 d 1 for aerobic digesters operated at 35 45 and 55 c respectively salsabil et al 43 determined the vss degradation constant to be 0 01 d 1 also jang et al 27 determined a first order rate constant of 0 07 d 1 for a reactor operated at 55 c these values are much lower than those found in the present investigation on the other hand values as high as 0 132 at 18 28 c 24 have been reported bhargava and datar 15 demonstrated that ksol 1 increased with increasing temperature from 5 to 35 c but there was a decline at higher temperatures up to 60 c at 35 c the vss solubilization rate constant was determined to be about 0 417 d 1 the cited solubilization rate constants are not quite comparable with those found in the current study since the properties of the digested sludges of the cited studies were different from each other it is postulated that undigested sludge characteristics are at least partly responsible for the discrepancies the measured and simulated vs concentrations using the developed model in the current study clarifies that it is crucial to consider the evaporation effect on the kinetics of vs and vss concentrations especially for aerobic digestion where evaporation rates are much higher using the model developed in the current investigation there is no need to add water to the reactors to adjust the sludge volume this is of great benefit to the fundamental research in this field since the evaporation increases the influent concentration in a flow through reactor and especially when the kinetics is concentration dependent the srt to reach a certain percentage of reduction in volatile solids mass is related to the evaporation rate because the volume of the reactor is directly proportional to srt the accurate design volume of the wastewater sludge digester depends on the evaporation rate since both vs and vss were modelled using first order kinetics an attempt was made to model vdssl concentration accordingly as shown in fig s10 c there was an increase in the concentration of vdssl in the aerobic digesters over digestion time also there could be a fraction of vds that would not be consumed therefore it is assumed vdssl consumption was negligible compared to the initial and produced amount if vds is produced as a result of liquefaction of solubilizable vss eqs a1 a3 see s12 hold in fact this concept has been used to explain the kinetics of scod during hydrolysis 44 45 rewriting eq 10 for vss sol t followed by further derivations eqs a4 a6 in s12 and substitutions yield eq 21 by which vdssl concentration at any given time during digestion may be predicted 21 vds sl t vds sl 0 vss sol 0 exp 1 k 1 sol t ln m sl 0 r evap t m sl 0 the vds sl model fittings are shown in fig 5 a c further details of the model fittings are displayed in table s14 surprisingly vsssol 0 determined by vds modelling was very different from that determined by vss modelling also r squared values were poor the highest one being 0 8469 for ad 45 fig 5 b in other words the model is not able to explain the progression of vds sl profile for ad 35 and 55 the model s overestimation of vds sl might explain the significant consumption of the realeased organics during digestion on the other hand the underestimation of vds sl by the model might be due to an increasing hydrolysis rate constant of biodegradable vs over time therefore the involvement of the mentioned cases needs to be verified in future research 4 conclusion this study was carried out to develop a mathematical approach for predicting volatile solids concentrations while water evaporation and solids destruction happened simultaneously water evaporation occurred in both anaerobic and aerobic laboratory digesters its intensity being much higher in the latter kinetic equations were developed to predict volatile solids concentration during anaerobic and aerobic digestion of sludge with water evaporation using first order kinetics a good agreement was observed between the measured and predicted vs concentrations of and 35 and 55 ad 35 45 and 55 however vs degradation of and 55 was more consistent with zero order kinetics than it was with first order kinetics the progression of vss concentration of the batch aerobic digesters was also predicted by a first order model reasonably well the developed models for batch reactors can be used for similar studies without needing to add water to the reactor to compensate for evaporative mass loss during digestion this model can be particularly useful for conducting research employing thermophilic aerobic sludge digesters where the evaporation rate is high due to the dependency of the digester design on the kinetics of digestion and the interplay between the solids destruction and evaporation rate it is important to consider evaporation rate for accurate determination of design parameters such as srt of wastewater sludge digesters the outcomes of this study indicate that water evaporation needs to be factored in for computing the exact value of the kinetic rate constant and solids reduction in the laboratory and full scale sludge digesters

13080,experimental and computational approaches were employed to model kinetics of volatile solids destruction in the presence of water evaporation during biological digestion of wastewater sludge water evaporation occurred in both anaerobic and aerobic laboratory digesters with a much higher intensity in the latter the water evaporation followed a linear trend over time by inclusion of the linear equation for water evaporation rate new kinetic models were developed to predict volatile solids vs and volatile suspended solids vss concentrations of batch biological digesters modelled results using a first order model were in good agreement with the measured vs concentrations of the anaerobic reactors operated at 35 c and 55 c and 55 with coefficients of determination r2 0 92 and 0 84 respectively vs degradation of and 55 was slightly more consistent with zero order kinetics r2 0 86 vs and vss concentrations measured for batch aerobic digesters also agreed with the first order model r2 values were 0 91 0 75 and 0 99 for reactors operated at 35 c ad 35 45 c and 55 c respectively as for the progression in terms of vss concentration the highest r2 and lowest sum of squared error values belonged to ad 35 this is the first study that developed kinetic models for simultaneous vs degradation and water evaporation under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions the outcomes of this study indicate that water evaporation needs to be considered for accurate determination of the kinetic rate constant and solids reduction in laboratory and full scale sludge digesters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords evaporation digestion kinetics sludge anaerobic aerobic 1 introduction sludge is a by product of wastewater treatment and needs to be treated due to the high volatile solids vs content of wastewater sludge some sludge treatment processes need to focus on vs reduction to achieve sludge stabilization biological digestion of sludge which can be done aerobically and anaerobically plays a key role in attaining vs reduction at wastewater treatment plants 1 2 both processes are carried out in reactors that can operate at various temperatures aerobic sludge digesters can be operated at ambient and thermophilic temperatures during which the temperature of the digesting content may reach 65 c 1 most anaerobic digesters are designed to work at 35 c and some are designed to work at around 55 c water evaporation is not typically considered in anaerobic digesters however since the retention time of sludge in the reactors is usually high i e 20 days appreciable water evaporation might occur during anaerobic digestion considering the high water content of sludge this would result in a significant mass loss biogas produced by anaerobic digesters may be partially recirculated inside the reactor to provide mixing 2 3 which is a particularly important parameter for both anaerobic and aerobic processes to succeed 1 4 also aerobic digesters are aerated to provide the oxygen required for aerobic biodegradation the aeration and gas mixing can intensify the escape of water from the digesters 5 7 unlike the case of anaerobic digestion numerous researchers have reported substantial water evaporation during aerobic digestion 8 13 although no measured value for evaporation rate was reported the issue was dealt with in several ways liu et al 12 let the evaporated water escape ginnivan et al 10 used moist air for aerobic digestion and mentioned that water losses due to evaporation were negligible jang et al 13 installed a condenser to return the escaped water back to the reactor moreover daily addition of deionized water to the reactor to compensate for water that is lost to evaporation has been in practice for a long time 11 14 16 nonetheless the addition of water to a reactor especially with long intervals may impact the reactor chemistry microbial populations and process kinetics these concerns also apply to anaerobic digestion thence knowledge of evaporation during sludge digestion is important to have a realistic understanding of process efficiency while solids destruction reduces solids concentration evaporation increases it equations to describe reaction kinetics link the progression of the reaction with the concentration of the reacting constituent 17 depending on the kinetics of solids destruction the effect of evaporation may differ there has been some research that focused on vs destruction and process modelling in aerated composting where water evaporation and vs destruction occur simultaneously 18 22 nevertheless the properties of the sludge fed into biological sludge digesters are very different from those used as feed for composting processes due to the significance of water evaporation it should be factored in the kinetic modelling of solids destruction during digestion of wastewater sludge this can have great implications for the design of digesters nevertheless the link between water evaporation and solids destruction kinetics during wastewater sludge digestion has not yet been addressed in the relevant literature therefore the current study is an endeavor to determine how significant the water evaporation is and subsequently develop a kinetic model of solids destruction that accounts for the water evaporation during anaerobic and aerobic digestion of wastewater sludge such models would more accurately predict volatile solids concentration of digested sludge for laboratory and full scale digesters 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale digester primary sludge ps thickened waste activated sludge t was and digested sludge ds were sampled from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in ottawa canada at the plant the incoming municipal wastewater is treated by a conventional activated sludge process followed by the chemical precipitation of phosphorus a full scale anaerobic digester is part of the wwtp according to the operation team of the wwtp the anaerobic digester consists of two groups completely mixed flow reactors cmfr in series while the reactors of each group are in parallel the first group receiving the feed sludge is operated at 37 c for better removal of pathogens the second group is operated at 41 c mixed ps and t was are fed into the digesters via two separate pipes and the volumetric ratio of ps to t was is roughly 4 5 measurements showed that the ratio of volatile solids vs to total solids ts of ps remained relatively constant 0 82 0 87 over time sludge samples of different sizes were collected from the wwtp depending on the purpose of sampling small sample sizes up to 1 l were cooled by ice packs right after sampling because they were used for measuring sensitive parameters such as solids content and ph large sample sizes 10 30 l were used for laboratory digestion experiments in less than three hours they were transferred to the laboratory and refrigerated 2 2 laboratory digesters three batch anaerobic reactors were made of 10 l working volume nalgene containers they were operated at 35 45 and 55 c which are hereafter called and 35 and 45 and and 55 respectively heating was provided by warmers blankets wrapped around the containers the warmers were connected to a temperature control system which had a temperature sensor submerged into the reactor during the digestion process an air lock was installed at the exhaust of the reactor to prevent contact between the reactor headspace and ambient air and to maintain water evaporation at manageable levels the batch aerobic digestion experiment was conducted at the same temperatures after the completion of the batch anaerobic digestion experiment the same reactors were modified by the addition of vapor condensers to mitigate the expected large water evaporation during aerobic digestion the condensers consisted of a copper tube at the centre coiled by a hose carrying cold water the condensers were installed between the gas exhaust and air lock of the reactors hereafter the three aerobic digesters operated at 35 45 and 55 c are called ad 35 ad 45 and ad 55 respectively aeration of aerobic reactors was made possible by transferring pressurized air into the reactor and distributing the transported air through a diffuser the pressurized air was filtered before being injected into the diffuser so far various flow rates and methods have been employed for air injection into aerobic digesters 11 12 23 27 this variability is understandable considering reactors of different types and sizes were employed in the cited papers to calculate the amount of oxygen required for the present work the following assumptions were made oxidizable organic matter had a chemical formula of c5h7o2n 1 with the concentration of 40 g l initial ammonia concentration was 50 mg l all the organic matter and ammonia initial and produced during digestion would be fully oxidized mineralized by the end of the experiment the assumed initial concentrations of oxidizable organic matter and ammonia were based on preliminary tests with the above assumptions and using a safety factor of four the applied airflow rate was determined to be about 140 ml min the assembled reactors and the accessories were secured on an orbital plate shaker for the anaerobic digesters the mixing intensity of the shaker was initially set at 140 rpm rpm which was reduced to 115 rpm after 3 days for the aerobic digesters the mixing intensity of the shaker was set at 90 10 rpm further details of the laboratory reactors are depicted in schematics shown in fig 1 a and b and pictures shown in figs s2 and s3 in the supplementary information si influent sludge of the full scale digester was prepared in the laboratory by mixing ps and t was with the same ratio as at the treatment plant the same influent sludge was used as the feed of batch reactors to which inoculum was added the mass fractions of the components of the reactor content were 0 74 0 16 and 0 1 for ps t was and inoculum respectively fig 2 illustrates the steps taken for conducting batch anaerobic and aerobic digestion the inocula of the anaerobic batch reactors ds from the full scale reactor were acclimatized in the same reactors in a separate run of digestion experiments with a mixture of ps and t was as feed at their respective temperatures the inoculum prepared for and 35 in the laboratory was found to be acidic consequently the aforementioned reactor was inoculated with digested sludge from the full scale anaerobic digester which was already acclimatized to the feed of batch digesters i e ps t was in the case of aerobic batch digesters the aerobic bacteria of t was would be the inoculum therefore acclimatization was achieved by running the aerobic digesters containing ps as feed and t was as inoculum to be acclimatized at their respective temperatures sludge samples were taken from the batch digesters throughout the digestion process to measure the parameters of interest 2 3 measurement of sludge solids total solids ts and fixed solids fs concentrations were determined thermally by heating sludge at 104 c for 24 h and 550 c for 2 h respectively volatile solids vs concentration was calculated as the difference between the two in this text square brackets denote concentration in g kg the measurements of ts vs and fs started on the same day of sampling and the measurements were done in triplicate ts mass fraction fts sl was calculated by dividing ts by 1000 where the index sl denotes sludge and this applies to all other relevant parameters of this article the total water mass fraction ftw sl of sludge was calculated by 1 fts sl to obtain sludge filtrate sludge samples were centrifuged at 14 000g for 1 h the supernatant was then filtered through a membrane with a pore diameter of 0 45 μm the filtrate was used to measure the concentration of the dissolved species supernatant and filtrate mass fractions were considered to be the same the work for acquiring the filtrate was carried out on the same day as sludge sampling and the obtained filtrate was stored in the fridge at 1 4 c until further analyses total dissolved solids tds and fixed dissolved solids fds concentrations were measured by heating the sludge filtrate at 104 c for 24 h and 550 c for 2 h respectively the concentration of volatile dissolved solids vds in the liquid phase was calculated by subtracting fds concentration from tds the measurements done in triplicate were carried out one day after sludge sampling day tds sl vds sl and fds sl were calculated by multiplying the corresponding filtrate concentration by ftw sl this was then used to compute concentration of suspended solids as follows tss ts tds sl vss vs vds sl fss fs fds sl note that average values were used for these calculations 2 4 measurement of sludge characteristics chemical oxygen demand cod and reactive phosphorus were measured by colorimetric methods using a dr 2800 spectrophotometer hach high range plus and high range cod reagents hach method 8000 were used for measuring total cod tcod and soluble cod scod high range molybovandate reagent hach method 8114 was used to measure reactive phosphorus the accuracy of the spectrophotometer and reagents was confirmed by measuring the concentration of the parameters in calibration standards the measurements were at least duplicated the following parameters were measured using specific hach probes ph orion 9157b thermo scientific oxidation reduction potential orp intellical mtc101 hach electrical conductivity ec inlabr730 mettler toledo dissolved oxygen do rdo orion 087003 thermo scientific total ammonia nitrogen tan intellical iseh3181 hach and nitrate intellical iseno 3181 hach the probes were calibrated before the start and during the digestion experiments the measurements were carried out immediately after sampling characteristics of the influent and digestate of full scale anaerobic digesters have been tabulated and shown in tables 1 and 2 2 5 measurement and estimation of evaporation rate the batch reactors were filled with 10 kg water and heated at the same temperatures as those applied for sludge digestion experiments mass of empty reactors was measured just before the start of the test and mass of the water only containing reactors was measured during evaporation periods once measured water mass was plotted versus evaporation time s3 a c in si the slope of the plot was the measured evaporation rate revap by conducting mass balance on the data collected from the batch digesters during the digestion experiments revap was estimated to determine whether evaporation rates in water only and sludge containing reactors were the same due to piping and electrical connections it was not possible to measure the mass of the sludge containing reactors during the digestion process nonetheless the masses of initial sludge just before digestion and final sludge at the end of digestion were measured additionally the mass of each sludge sample taken during the digestion experiments was also measured the corresponding water masses were calculated by multiplying the sludge mass by ftw sl the water mass loss due to evaporation is equal to the difference between total water mass loss and the water mass loss due to sampling during the experiment in other words if there was no evaporation the total water mass loss would have to be the same as water mass loss due to the sampling to compute the estimated water evaporation rate the mass of water lost to evaporation was then divided by the time interval within which evaporation took place this time period was in fact the duration of sludge digestion in the batch experiments the above description is formulated by eq 1 where i and f mean initial and final respectively the number of sludge sample is denoted by a and m is mass in this formulation the evaporation rate was considered to be constant with respect to evaporation time which was based on the water evaporation plots obtained from the water only tests as shown in fig s3 a and c in si 1 r evap m sl i f tw sl i a 1 a f m sl sam a f tw sam sl a m sl f f tw sl f t 2 6 kinetic

t k n vs b n m sl first order kinetic equations have been frequently used to model the destruction of volatile matter during anaerobic digestion 30 31 and aerobic digestion 27 32 therefore n can be considered to be 1 and eq 4 holds 4 vs b m sl t k 1 vs b m sl assuming a linear water mass loss over evaporation time the mass of water at any given time can be calculated using eq 5 considering the very small amount of destructible matter in the sludge mass loss of sludge during digestion is mainly due to evaporation thus eq 6 holds 5 m w t m w 0 r evap t 6 m sl t m sl 0 r evap t substitution of

time period to solve for vs at any given time the analytical solution to eq 8 is eq 9 the same approach can be used to find an expression eq 10 for vss in which case vss vsssol vsnonsol here the indices sol and nonsol denote solubilizable and insolubilizable respectively note that the kinetic rate constant in this case would be specific to solubilization or solids liquefaction k1 sol which is

carried out using the solver function of excel software to obtain the best fit a trade off was made between a low value for the sum of squared error sse and a high value for the coefficient of determination r2 in addition reduced mean squared error rmse values were calculated to further check the model s goodness of fit 3 results and discussion 3 1 water evaporation rate fig s3 a shows the change in water mass due to evaporation from the water only containing anaerobic reactors without aeration and without air lock installed the loss of water mass was linear over time the slopes of the linear fits of the evaporation rates are shown in table 1 under such conditions evaporation rates were proportional to the reactor temperatures with air locks installed fig s3 b however there was no evaporation from the water only containing anaerobic reactors at the end of the digestion experiments mass balance calculations were conducted to calculate the evaporation rate for each reactor table 3 it can be seen that the estimated evaporation rates were not directly proportional to the applied temperatures the estimated evaporation rates of and 35 and 55 were almost zero and that of and 45 was 0 04 kg d the measured and estimated evaporation rates table 3 were quite consistent for the and 35 and 55 and ad 35 45 and 55 evaporative reduction of water mass in the aerated water only containing aerobic reactors is depicted in fig s3 c in this configuration the evaporation rate was proportional to the applied temperature the evaporation test for ad 55 ended at day 20 because almost all the water initially added to the reactor had evaporated by that time in line with this the sludge content of the same reactor had dried after about 23 days after the start of the aerobic digestion experiment in cases where water evaporation was observed the curves are perfectly linear meaning evaporation rates did not change with time nor did they alter with a change in mass of water remaining in the reactors the estimated evaporation of water from and 45 would cause a maximum 10 increase in the measured concentration of vs on the last day of the digestion as the estimated evaporation rate was not supported by the corresponding result from the water only evaporation test kinetic modelling for and 45 was conducted for both scenarios i e with and without water evaporation 3 2 anaerobic digestion trends of ph and do concentration of the batch anaerobic digesters are shown in fig s4 a and b respectively variations of ts and fs concentrations in the same reactors are depicted in fig s5 a and b respectively model fittings using first order kinetics and the corresponding experimental data are shown in fig 3 a the model parameters and goodness of fit are presented in s6 the first order model fits the experimental data from and 35 the best sse 6 38 and r2 0 92 it can be seen that the poorest fit belongs to and 45 sse 63 4 and r2 0 68 the results of kinetic modelling of and 45 vs destruction with and without water evaporation were the same in terms of all model parameters except for the rate constant which was 16 higher for the case with evaporation as for and 55 the first order kinetic model could fairly describe the trend of vs destruction the computed rate constant for and 35 is within the range found for activated sludge hydrolysis 30 33 and methane production 34 rate constants at mesophilic temperatures from the data presented in table s 6 vs b 0 of and 35 is calculated to be only 29 of vs which is questionable an explanation could be the inactivity of bacteria due to the low ph levels of and 35 see fig s4 a in line with this perspective yan et al 35 showed that the efficiency of vs reduction decreased with decreasing initial ph level from 8 to 6 5 during anaerobic digestion of slaughterhouse sludge at 35 c the higher performance of and 45 than and 55 might be related to the better adaptability of the microorganisms to their physical and chemical conditions the poor fit of the kinetic model to the and 45 fig 1 a data is to a large extent because of an outlier concentration measured at day 12 of digestion hao et al 36 fitted vss concentrations obtained from 10 day hydrolysis of was at 50 c to a first order kinetic model the r squared values of this study were between 0 8692 and 0 9760 on the other hand a linear relationship was established by lin and chou 24 when they aerobically digested septage in a cmfr at ambient temperature furthermore zhang et al 37 observed a fairly linear removal versus time trend when they digested t was likewise the trend of datapoints obtained from measured vs values of and 55 of the current investigation did not seem to be perfectly following first order kinetics although there was a smooth downward trend thus a zero order kinetic model for the batch reactor was worked out as formulated by eqs 11 and 12 11 d vs b m sl t k 0 m sl 12 d vs b dt vs b r evap m sl 0 r evap t k 0 once eq 12 is integrated eq 13 is obtained 13 vs t vs b 0 vs nonb k 0 t 2 m sl 0 r evap t 2 m sl 0 2 r evap t considering the evaporation rate for the reactor was zero eq 13 is simplified to eq 14 14 vs t vs b 0 vs nonb k 0 t the model fitting is shown in fig 3 b and parameters of model goodness are provided in table s6 by comparing sse rmse and r2 values of the first order model with those of the zero order model one could come to the conclusion that the latter was more capable of describing the vs destruction trend in and 55 total and fixed solids concentrations of ps t was and ds sampled from the plants were plotted against time in fig 3 c d and e respectively the measured solids concentration of the sludge samples obtained from the plant showed in spite of large fluctuations in the vs concentration of the influent components fig 3 c and d vs concentration of the digested sludge remained relatively constant fig 3 e by using the data shown in fig 3 c e kinetic rate constants of the full scale anaerobic digester of the wwtp can be calculated for the time period over which sludge samples were collected according to the information received from the wwtp srt was estimated to be 30 days which may be long enough for significant water evaporation the logarithmic term on the right hand side of eqs 9 and 10 indeed represents a concentration factor equal to msl 0 msl t for a continuous flow reactor this would be expressed as influent to digested sludge mass flow rate the digested sludge mass flow rate can be calculated using eq 15 the actual vs concentration vs act of the influent is equal to the measured concentration vs meas times the concentration factor as shown by eq 16 because the full scale digester was operated with only one srt and the laboratory batch reactors were not expected to simulate the reactivity of vs in the full scale digester its vsnonb cannot be known in the present study therefore the measured vs concentrations of the influent and digested sludge were used for computing k1 values the calculated values might not be precise they can be rather called observed rate constants their trend over time however could reflect that of actual k1 values the full scale reactor of the current study was a cmfr for the most part but the last compartment connected to the previous reactors in series would constitute a plug flow reactor pfr therefore incorporation of the water evaporation term is carried out for both types of hydraulic regimes under steady state conditions general solutions to eq 2 for ideal cmfr and pfr with first order reactions are eqs 17 and 18 38 substitution of eq 16 into eqs 17 and 18 and solving for k1 yields eqs 19 and 20 respectively 15 m ds m in r evap srt 16 vs in act m ds r evap srt m i n vs in meas 17 vs

srt with the same influent and digested sludge concentrations for cmfr and pfr k1 values are different for the two types of reactors eqs 19 and 20 were used to estimate rate constants of the full scale anaerobic digester the evaporation rate measured for water only batch reactors without air lock operated at 35 c was initially used to estimate kinetic rate constants for this purpose the results are plotted against time in fig 3 f calculations showed that even the highest evaporation rate measured in the laboratory does not have any effect on the rate constants of the full scale anaerobic digester this would not mean that the evaporation rate in the full scale anaerobic digester was as low as the ones determined in the batch anaerobic digesters since the reactor configuration in the wwtp was understandably very different from the laboratory digesters further calculations were done assuming much higher evaporation rates the calculations showed that at a water evaporation rate of 1000 kg d rate constants of vs destruction could be 30 higher than those calculated under the no evaporation condition regardless of the evaporation rate and the kinetic model used the rate constants varied over time this could happen due to the alteration of the sludge reactivity over time zhao and viraraghavan 39 assumed such a change to be a function of influent vs concentration this assumption was proved to be the case for the hydrolysis rate constant of vss at 50 c when hao et al 36 observed an increase in the rate constant with increasing initial vss concentration another explanation for the varying rate constant would be the changes that might have happened due to the inoculum to substrate ratio 29 3 3 aerobic digestion trends of ph and do concentration of the batch anaerobic digesters are shown in fig s7 a and b respectively variations of ts and fs concentrations of the same reactors are depicted in fig s8 a and b respectively the experimental and modelled trends of vs concentration for batch aerobic digesters are shown in fig 4 a further details of modelling results are outlined in table s9 as expected the first order kinetic model was able to simulate the trend established by experimental data the model described ad 35 trend better than ad 45 and 55 in the case of ad 45 and 55 vs concentration increased over time in actuality the predicted values for vs concentrations of ad 55 on days 15 and 20 were off by 17 and 20 respectively examination of the vs content of the aerobic digesters of the current studies showed that the ad 35 45 and 55 achieved 48 2 39 7 and 14 4 vs reductions respectively using autothermal aerobic digestion for 360 and 554 h liu et al 12 25 reduced vs content by about 40 jang et al 2019 observed 60 4 reduction in vs after 360 h of aerobic digestion at 55 c compared to the reductions cited the thermophilic aerobic digesters of the current study did not perform as expected but this could be due to the differences in sludge characteristics jang et al 26 27 reported significantly different vs reductions for two different types of sludges that were digested in the same reactors under the same conditions non biodegradable vs content accounted for 50 4 51 9 and 54 8 of volatile solids in the undigested feed sludge of aerobic digesters table s9 these values are higher than 42 2 reported by lin and chou 24 the study in which septage sludge was aerobically digested on the other hand from the data presented by kavitha et al 32 vsnonb vs of a was can be estimated to be about 92 for a digester operating at room temperature the decrease in vs reduction with increasing temperature seems counter intuitive as one would expect to see otherwise one reason could be the errors in the sampling and measurement of solids content in ad 45 and 55 on the final day these errors were more likely to happen towards the end of the experiments due to the higher solids concentration of sludge and related difficulties in taking uniform and homogenous samples the coefficient of determination for the first order models describing vs degradation during aerobic digestion was found to be 0 98 at room temperature 24 greater than 0 988 at 35 c 45 c and 55 c 40 0 986 at room temperature 32 and 0 97 at 55 c 27 the r squared value determined for ad 55 is within the range of the figures cited but those of ad 35 and 45 are not dissolved solids concentrations fig s10 a and b were subtracted from their respective total solids concentrations fig s8 a and b to determine the suspended solids concentrations of the batch aerobic digesters as depicted in figs 4 b and s10 d and e since vss is a fraction of vs it would be interesting to see how well the models fit vss concentration values of the aerobic sludge digesters the experimental and simulated results are shown in fig 4 b the details of modelling results are displayed in table s11 in the case of ad 35 and 45 the r2 values for the vss model fittings table s11 were higher than those for the vs model fittings table s9 while the corresponding sse values for the vss model fittings table s11 of ad 35 and 45 were lower than those for the vs model fittings table s9 in the case of ad 55 on the other hand the r2 value of vss model fitting was lower than that of vs while the situation with respect to comparing the sse values was the other way around tables s11 and s9 non solubilizable vss contents of the feeds were 44 8 42 6 and 41 7 for ad 35 45 and 55 respectively table s11 from the data presented by bhargava and datar 15 vssnonsol vss of the undigested feed sludge of a digester can be estimated to be about 64 this value has been calculated based on the reported vss contents of the initial sludge and the sludge sample taken after 28 days of aerobic digestion at 30 c vs mass reductions were calculated to be 48 2 39 7 and 14 4 whereas vss mass reductions were calculated to be 52 5 46 2 and 19 5 for ad 35 45 and 55 respectively this indicates that solubilization of volatile solids content occurred to a considerably larger extent than complete mineralization did based on the results reported by bhargava and datar 15 vss reductions during a set of aerobic digestions were as follows 45 6 at 30 c after 15 d 40 7 at 45 c after 13 d 34 9 at 55 c after 15 d and 38 2 at 60 c after 15 d a study on thermophilic aerobic digestion showed a vss reduction of about 34 3 where the hydraulic regime was cmfr and srt was gradually reduced from 4 to 1 day during the process 41 furthermore it has been demonstrated that vss removal depends on initial vss concentration 8 9 an important note about the modelling approach presented in the current study is the estimation of the evaporation rate of sludge during digestion due to high evaporation solids concentration increased during the process in ad 45 and 55 and even the nature of solids would have undergone significant changes at least in terms of vs content the evaporation rate might be affected by the affinity of solids for water or lack thereof this would mean there could be cases where the evaporation rate would change during digestion even under isothermal conditions results of nebiker 42 are in line with this perspective where sludge drying in the open air was studied notwithstanding the models developed for vs and vss using constant water evaporation rate in the present study can at least predict the vs and vss trends correctly an explanation is that the sludge moisture content did not reach a critical point where the effect of water particle interaction on evaporation would become a dominant factor therefore the experimental approach utilized in the current study to measure the evaporation rate is considered appropriate it was expected to see a difference between the fittings for vs and vss of the aerobic digestion experiments for three reasons the first reason is the number of data points vss having one less data point because suspended solids concentration was not measured on sludge samples taken on day 3 the second reason is unlike vs degradation solubilization vss does not mean a complete breakdown and eventual conversion into mineral species also the value of solubilizable vss concentration at any given time could be smaller larger or equal to that of biodegradable vs concentration liu et al 40 determined k1 values of 0 00069 d 1 0 00097 d 1 and 0 00111 d 1 for aerobic digesters operated at 35 45 and 55 c respectively salsabil et al 43 determined the vss degradation constant to be 0 01 d 1 also jang et al 27 determined a first order rate constant of 0 07 d 1 for a reactor operated at 55 c these values are much lower than those found in the present investigation on the other hand values as high as 0 132 at 18 28 c 24 have been reported bhargava and datar 15 demonstrated that ksol 1 increased with increasing temperature from 5 to 35 c but there was a decline at higher temperatures up to 60 c at 35 c the vss solubilization rate constant was determined to be about 0 417 d 1 the cited solubilization rate constants are not quite comparable with those found in the current study since the properties of the digested sludges of the cited studies were different from each other it is postulated that undigested sludge characteristics are at least partly responsible for the discrepancies the measured and simulated vs concentrations using the developed model in the current study clarifies that it is crucial to consider the evaporation effect on the kinetics of vs and vss concentrations especially for aerobic digestion where evaporation rates are much higher using the model developed in the current investigation there is no need to add water to the reactors to adjust the sludge volume this is of great benefit to the fundamental research in this field since the evaporation increases the influent concentration in a flow through reactor and especially when the kinetics is concentration dependent the srt to reach a certain percentage of reduction in volatile solids mass is related to the evaporation rate because the volume of the reactor is directly proportional to srt the accurate design volume of the wastewater sludge digester depends on the evaporation rate since both vs and vss were modelled using first order kinetics an attempt was made to model vdssl concentration accordingly as shown in fig s10 c there was an increase in the concentration of vdssl in the aerobic digesters over digestion time also there could be a fraction of vds that would not be consumed therefore it is assumed vdssl consumption was negligible compared to the initial and produced amount if vds is produced as a result of liquefaction of solubilizable vss eqs a1 a3 see s12 hold in fact this concept has been used to explain the kinetics of scod during hydrolysis 44 45 rewriting eq 10 for vss sol t followed by further derivations eqs a4 a6 in s12 and substitutions yield eq 21 by which vdssl concentration at any given time during digestion may be predicted 21 vds sl t vds sl 0 vss sol 0 exp 1 k 1 sol t ln m sl 0 r evap t m sl 0 the vds sl model fittings are shown in fig 5 a c further details of the model fittings are displayed in table s14 surprisingly vsssol 0 determined by vds modelling was very different from that determined by vss modelling also r squared values were poor the highest one being 0 8469 for ad 45 fig 5 b in other words the model is not able to explain the progression of vds sl profile for ad 35 and 55 the model s overestimation of vds sl might explain the significant consumption of the realeased organics during digestion on the other hand the underestimation of vds sl by the model might be due to an increasing hydrolysis rate constant of biodegradable vs over time therefore the involvement of the mentioned cases needs to be verified in future research 4 conclusion this study was carried out to develop a mathematical approach for predicting volatile solids concentrations while water evaporation and solids destruction happened simultaneously water evaporation occurred in both anaerobic and aerobic laboratory digesters its intensity being much higher in the latter kinetic equations were developed to predict volatile solids concentration during anaerobic and aerobic digestion of sludge with water evaporation using first order kinetics a good agreement was observed between the measured and predicted vs concentrations of and 35 and 55 ad 35 45 and 55 however vs degradation of and 55 was more consistent with zero order kinetics than it was with first order kinetics the progression of vss concentration of the batch aerobic digesters was also predicted by a first order model reasonably well the developed models for batch reactors can be used for similar studies without needing to add water to the reactor to compensate for evaporative mass loss during digestion this model can be particularly useful for conducting research employing thermophilic aerobic sludge digesters where the evaporation rate is high due to the dependency of the digester design on the kinetics of digestion and the interplay between the solids destruction and evaporation rate it is important to consider evaporation rate for accurate determination of design parameters such as srt of wastewater sludge digesters the outcomes of this study indicate that water evaporation needs to be factored in for computing the exact value of the kinetic rate constant and solids reduction in the laboratory and full scale sludge digesters

and the anode potential was 2 0 v for the electrochemical filtration 2 2 2 pretreatment of the cnt membrane after being cut into circles with 47 mm diameters the cnt membrane pretreatment was conducted as follows the membranes were first purified by calcination at 400 c for 2 h to remove any amorphous and non cnt carbon impurities then cooled to room temperature naturally calcination was

calcinated in a muffle furnace sx2 12 12 the shanghai kanglu instrument equipment co ltd shanghai china by gradually raising the temperature at 2 5 c min from ambient temperature to the selected temperature of 850 c and maintained for 1 h the ceramic flat membranes were obtained after natural cooling to room temperature 2 3 chemical analysis and characterization the concentration of an was determined using the n 1 naphthalene ethylenediamine azo spectrophotometric method the morphologies of the cnt electrode materials were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem japan electron optics laboratory co ltd japan the oep of the electrode and the manner of oxidation of aniline were determined by cyclic voltammetry cv experiments scan rate 0 01 v s in 0 01 m na2so4 solution with 40 mg l an the apparent current efficiency ce of the an degradation was calculated as follows 1 ce c 0 c t v it where c0 and ct are the initial concentration and the mean concentration during 0 t min respectively mg l v is the volume of solution l at the recirculated filtration mode v is 0 25 l and at the single pass filtration mode v q t q is the water flux ml min i is the current a and t is the reaction time min 3 results and discussions 3 1 cv experiments the electrochemical properties of aniline at the cnt membrane electrode were investigated by cv within the ph range 2 0 10 0 and the results are shown in fig 2 the cyclic voltammogram at ph 7 0 showed that the oxidation peak of an around 0 6 v versus ag agcl and the water oxidation around 1 2 v versus ag agcl the study of the effect of the ph on the voltammetric behavior of an at the cnt electrodes also showed that increasing ph from 2 0 up to 10 0 resulted in a slight shift of the oxidation peaks toward lower potential values as reported for aniline oxidation at boron doped diamond electrode 26 the reduction peak could be attributed to the evolution of intermediates adsorbed on the electrode surface 26 3 2 effect of adsorption an removal using the electrochemical treatment at an anode potential of 1 5 v and adsorption by the cnt electrode membrane in the absence of electricity were investigated the results are presented in fig 3 the results demonstrated the obvious differences in the recirculated filtration mode the an removal ratio was 7 5 after 120 min of adsorption while it was 57 3 after 120 min of the electrochemical filtration treatment in the single pass filtration mode the effluent concentration of the an decreased during the initial stage and then increased to approximately the initial concentration after 15 min of adsorption however the effluent concentration was maintained at approximately 32 5 mg l throughout the entire electrochemical reaction this suggested that adsorption has little effect on an removal however electrochemical filtration could serve as a sustainable high performance treatment process for an wastewater treatment 3 3 the effects of the water conditions 3 3 1 the effect of ph the electrochemical degradation of many organic compounds is influenced by solution ph to explore the effects of ph on an degradation the initial ph values were set at 2 0 5 0 7 0 and 10 0 as shown in fig 4 a the highest an degradation efficiency was observed at ph 7 0 and the degradation rate decreased when the value decreased to 5 0 and 2 0 in addition to direct electron transfer the electrochemical degradation of organic contaminants at the anode surface is generally ascribed to indirect an anodic oxidation process 10 27 2 h 2 o oh h e 3 oh organics co 2 h 2 o therefore a higher h will shift the equilibrium to the left side of the reaction 10 which is unbeneficial to an degradation in addition the lowest degradation efficiency at ph 2 0 might also be associated with the protonation reaction of an pka 4 63 25 c leading to enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the anode and cationic form of an and thus a deteriorated oxidation efficiency when ph increased from 7 0 to 10 0 the an degradation rate decreased too such a change might be attributed to the competitive occupation of the anode surface by the increased amount of oh due to electro adsorption which would reduce the active sites for an degradation in this study the effect of in situ produced h2o2 via a two electron o2 reduction reaction at the cathode surface was omitted due to the much smaller ti strip surface area compared to the cnt anode and the low yield 13 28 in the single pass mode fig 4 b the an degradation rates displayed a similar phenomenon the effluent concentration was the highest at ph 2 0 and obviously lower at ph 5 0 7 0 and 10 0 it was noted that ph did not play a significant role within the range of 5 10 which could be attributed to the lack of accumulative effect of an concentration decrease thus the effluent concentration lines of these tests interweaved together 3 3 2 the effect of the initial an concentration the degradation efficiencies at different initial an concentrations 20 30 and 60 mg l were examined and are presented in fig 5 overall the removal efficiency decreased with increasing initial concentrations this may be explained as follows first an increase in the initial concentration is a process of increasing resistance therefore the rate of electron transfer was blocked and the removal efficiency decreased with the increasing initial concentration 29 second concentration polarization would cause a decrease in the removal efficiency the rate of the target moving toward the electrode was slow when the initial an concentration was high 29 30 third the accumulation of intermediate products during parent molecule degradation which is performed on surface sites at the anode surface will further reduce the removal efficiency the higher pollutant concentration will lead to a more serious accumulation which is likely to counteract the beneficial effect of the increased reaction chances caused by the high an concentration itself 3 3 3 the effect of the support electrolyte concentration the influences of the na2so4 concentration were also investigated as shown in fig 6 the degradation efficiency varied depending on the applied support electrolyte concentration for both the recirculated filtration mode and the single pass mode the an degradation efficiencies in the runs with 0 01 mol l and 0 1 mol l were higher than that of the 0 001 mol l this was likely due to the addition of na2so4 which would increase conductivity of the solution and therefore increase the removal efficiency 29 when the supporting electrolyte concentration was 0 001 mol l the resistance was large the current was small and the removal efficiency of an was small however when the ionic strength increased from 0 01 mol l to 0 1 mol l the degradation efficiency stabilized and even slightly decreased this can be attributed to an increase of the force among ions due to an increase in the support electrolyte concentration 31 thus affecting the electrochemical treatment results the results suggest that a higher support electrolyte concentration will not consequentially lead to enhanced treatment efficiency too high of a support electrolyte concentration may cause a decrease in the ce as shown in fig 11 c due to the fact that industrial wastewater typically has a certain amount of background electrolytes it is very significant from a practical point of view to control the electrolyte concentration at reasonable levels 3 4 the effects of the running conditions 3 4 1 the effect of the anode potential potential is another important impact factor on pollutant electrochemical degradation because it directly determines the contaminant removal and side reactions as shown in fig 7 an removal exhibited a positive correlation with the applied anode potential when adjusted to 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 v in the recirculated filtration mode after 120 min of the electrochemical reaction the highest an removal ratio of 81 was achieved at an anode potential of 2 0 v this was consistent with the phenomenon observed in other studies 9 10 electron transfer mechanisms are generally classified into direct oxidation and indirect oxidation direct oxidation has a stronger surface site dependence while indirect electrooxidation is more dependent on the anode potential 9 it is believed that at nonactive electrodes the physio absorbed hydroxyl radical production increases and can oxidize more organics present in solution at a high current intensity 29 32 in this study it would be expected that the contribution of indirect oxidation to the an degradation would increase with an increasing anode potential overall the anode potential showed the similar effects on the an degradation in the single pass mode on the whole the removal ratio at the 2 0 v potential was higher than at the 1 0 v and 1 5 v potential although the effluent concentration lines interweaved to a certain degree 3 4 2 the effect of the water flux in this study the water flux of the electrochemical filter due to peristaltic pump suction reached up to 15 ml min water flux density 83 9 ml cm2 h without any air leakage or cnt membrane damage which was much higher than some typical electrochemical filters in the references listed in table 1 the highest water flux density reached 4 0 16 1 fold higher than those in the other studies the buckypaper membrane morphologies after filtration are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a the cnt membrane with a ceramic membrane support in this study was intact except for the indentation due to the separation layer however the free standing buckypaper membrane loaded in a commercial electrochemistry modified polycarbonate filtration casing as described in the references 7 17 20 21 33 swelled due to bubble accumulation fig 8 b the configuration with the ceramic membrane support perfectly overcame the drawbacks such as the limit of water flux bubble accumulation and cnt membrane fragility of the conventional electrochemical filter fig 9 shows the field emission scanning electron microscope fesem images of the cnt membrane before and after use in this study the cnts were randomly oriented and formed a porous 3d network before use the diameter of cnt arranged 0 02 to 0 2 μm and the surface of cnts was clean and smooth after use the 3d structure of cnt membrane electrode kept well in contrast the cnt membrane had a much rougher surface which could be attributed to the intermediates deposition and the oxidation of cnts to clarify the effects of water flux an electrochemical degradation was conducted at fluxes of 5 0 10 0 and 15 0 ml min in both modes according to fig 10 in the recirculated filtration mode the an degradation rates at fluxes of 10 0 and 15 0 ml min were obviously higher than that at 5 ml min this can be attributed to the increased mass transfer leading to increased reaction chances for an however the increase in the water flux would not increase the degradation rate of organic pollutants without limit the degradation rate at 15 ml min did not further increase further as expected and it was similar to that at 10 ml min or even slightly decreased such a degradation rate stabilization indicated that when the hindrance of the concentration polarization had been overcome as far as possible by improving mass transfer the hindrance of the chemical polarization a rate determining chemical step could not be controlled by the water flux in addition although high water flux can improve the desorption of reaction byproducts their accumulation likelihood still exists however ultra high flux may mean that an ultra short liquid residence time is required for an to be captured by the cnt to degrade furthermore the ultra high flux could generate possible compression of the cnt membrane thus lowering the membrane porosity and decreasing the effective internal electro transfer site 20 in the recirculated filtration mode the increase in the effluent an concentration with the increasing water flux could also be explained by the above assumptions in brief the impact of water flux on an degradation remains a complicated process 3 5 comparison of the different operational modes apparent ce a key indicator used to evaluate an electrochemical reactor has been widely used on a variety of occasions 10 29 39 40 in this study to further clarify the characteristics of the two filtration modes the apparent ce of a 120 min reaction was compared and is presented in fig 11 in general the apparent ces of the sing pass filtration mode were higher than those of the recirculated filtration mode with all the other impact factors being equal this could be attributed to the influence of the an concentration change during the reaction this is because in the case of the recirculated filtration the an concentration would decrease as the reaction progresses resulting in a decrease in the effective electron transfer for an degradation however in the case of the single pass filtration the influent of the an concentration remained constant thus the effective electron transfer might still have remained at a higher level this phenomenon was verified by the apparent ce decrease with the initial an concentration decrease in the case of the single pass filtration as shown in fig 11 a the effects of the initial ph fig 11 b the support electrolyte concentration fig 11 c and the applied anode potential fig 11 d on the apparent ce were not the same or similar in both filtration modes for instance in the single pass filtration mode the apparent ce varied considerably with the initial ph and the highest apparent ce appeared at ph 7 0 however in the recirculated filtration mode the apparent ce changed slightly this may have been due to the fact that in the single pass filtration mode the device is a system of relative stable influent water conditions such as the influent ph and initial an concentration according to cv results the current increases in acidic solution which would definitely result in a lower apparent ce value however it is a relatively closed system of unstable water conditions in the recirculated filtration mode in the recirculated filtration mode with the degradation of an a variety of intermediate products will certainly be produced and evolve and the solution ph will also change correspondingly these changes may cause accumulative effect and change the surface structure and chemistry of the electrode and affect the effective electron transfer therefore different effects on the apparent ce of an degradation appeared in two different operational modes overall in both modes the apparent ce decreased with increases in the support electrolyte concentration i e conductivity increase and applied anode potential which could be attributed to the more ineffective electricity consumption during the process the lowest apparent ce was found at flux of 10 0 ml min as shown in fig 11 e which could be attributed to the dual effects of increasing flux higher flux is generally assumed to have a stronger washing effect on the deposited intermediates to improve the effective electron transfer and apparent ce however the higher flux may also result in more oxygen evolution and other electron transfers while the reaction was occurring 27 and further decrease the apparent ce however the apparent ce cannot be used as the only indicator to evaluate different operation modes in the single pass mode the effluent concentration is generally much high due to the lack of accumulative effect of an removal therefore the recirculated mode is more appropriate for actual sewage treatment which needs to meet a discharge standard although the apparent ces of the single pass filtration mode were generally higher than those of the recirculated filtration mode 4 conclusions the ceramic flat membrane was used as the support for the cnt membrane electrode in an electrochemical filter the maximum water flux of the electrochemical filter reached 15 0 ml min 83 9 ml cm2 h without any cnt membrane damage which greatly improves the practicability of electrochemical filtration technology based on the cnt electrode the effects of initial ph electrolyte concentration anode potential and initial an concentration on an degradation were generally similar in both the single pass and the recirculated filtration modes the increasing flux increased the an degradation rate but the increasing effect of flux was not unlimited the recirculation filtration mode is more suitable for actual sewage treatment to meet a discharge standard although the apparent ces of the single pass filtration mode are higher declaration of competing interest the

conducted as follows the membranes were first purified by calcination at 400 c for 2 h to remove any amorphous and non cnt carbon impurities then cooled to room temperature naturally calcination was followed by a subsequent acid treatment by submerging the cnt membrane in diluted hcl 1 9 72 h to remove the residual metal oxide catalyst finally the samples were washed with di water to a constant ph 2 2 3 preparation of the ceramic membrane the proportioning of perlite sodium alginate polyethylene glycol and methyl cellulose was 4 2 5 0 1 1 0 after the above materials were evenly admixed the right amount of deionized water was injected and the mixture was churned continuously until being pasted then the paste was shaped into flat membranes using modules and air dried afterwards they were calcinated in a muffle furnace sx2 12 12 the shanghai kanglu instrument equipment co ltd shanghai china by gradually raising the temperature at 2 5 c min from ambient temperature to the selected temperature of 850 c and maintained for 1 h the ceramic flat membranes were obtained after natural cooling to room temperature 2 3 chemical analysis and characterization the concentration of an was determined using the n 1 naphthalene ethylenediamine azo spectrophotometric method the morphologies of the cnt electrode materials were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem japan electron optics laboratory co ltd japan the oep of the electrode and the manner of oxidation of aniline were determined by cyclic voltammetry cv experiments scan rate 0 01 v s in 0 01 m na2so4 solution with 40 mg l an the apparent current efficiency ce of the an degradation was calculated as follows 1 ce c 0 c t v it where c0 and ct are the initial concentration and the mean concentration during 0 t min respectively mg l v is the volume of solution l at the recirculated filtration mode v is 0 25 l and at the single pass filtration mode v q t q is the water flux ml min i is the current a and t is the reaction time min 3 results and discussions 3 1 cv experiments the electrochemical properties of aniline at the cnt membrane electrode were investigated by cv within the ph range 2 0 10 0 and the results are shown in fig 2 the cyclic voltammogram at ph 7 0 showed that the oxidation peak of an around 0 6 v versus ag agcl and the water oxidation around 1 2 v versus ag agcl the study of the effect of the ph on the voltammetric behavior of an at the cnt electrodes also showed that increasing ph from 2 0 up to 10 0 resulted in a slight shift of the oxidation peaks toward lower potential values as reported for aniline oxidation at boron doped diamond electrode 26 the reduction peak could be attributed to the evolution of intermediates adsorbed on the electrode surface 26 3 2 effect of adsorption an removal using the electrochemical treatment at an anode potential of 1 5 v and adsorption by the cnt electrode membrane in the absence of electricity were investigated the results are presented in fig 3 the results demonstrated the obvious differences in the recirculated filtration mode the an removal ratio was 7 5 after 120 min of adsorption while it was 57 3 after 120 min of the electrochemical filtration treatment in the single pass filtration mode the effluent concentration of the an decreased during the initial stage and then increased to approximately the initial concentration after 15 min of adsorption however the effluent concentration was maintained at approximately 32 5 mg l throughout the entire electrochemical reaction this suggested that adsorption has little effect on an removal however electrochemical filtration could serve as a sustainable high performance treatment process for an wastewater treatment 3 3 the effects of the water conditions 3 3 1 the effect of ph the electrochemical degradation of many organic compounds is influenced by solution ph to explore the effects of ph on an degradation the initial ph values were set at 2 0 5 0 7 0 and 10 0 as shown in fig 4 a the highest an degradation efficiency was observed at ph 7 0 and the degradation rate decreased when the value decreased to 5 0 and 2 0 in addition to direct electron transfer the electrochemical degradation of organic contaminants at the anode surface is generally ascribed to indirect an anodic oxidation process 10 27 2 h 2 o oh h e 3 oh organics co 2 h 2 o therefore a higher h will shift the equilibrium to the left side of the reaction 10 which is unbeneficial to an degradation in addition the lowest degradation efficiency at ph 2 0 might also be associated with the protonation reaction of an pka 4 63 25 c leading to enhanced electrostatic repulsion between the anode and cationic form of an and thus a deteriorated oxidation efficiency when ph increased from 7 0 to 10 0 the an degradation rate decreased too such a change might be attributed to the competitive occupation of the anode surface by the increased amount of oh due to electro adsorption which would reduce the active sites for an degradation in this study the effect of in situ produced h2o2 via a two electron o2 reduction reaction at the cathode surface was omitted due to the much smaller ti strip surface area compared to the cnt anode and the low yield 13 28 in the single pass mode fig 4 b the an degradation rates displayed a similar phenomenon the effluent concentration was the highest at ph 2 0 and obviously lower at ph 5 0 7 0 and 10 0 it was noted that ph did not play a significant role within the range of 5 10 which could be attributed to the lack of accumulative effect of an concentration decrease thus the effluent concentration lines of these tests interweaved together 3 3 2 the effect of the initial an concentration the degradation efficiencies at different initial an concentrations 20 30 and 60 mg l were examined and are presented in fig 5 overall the removal efficiency decreased with increasing initial concentrations this may be explained as follows first an increase in the initial concentration is a process of increasing resistance therefore the rate of electron transfer was blocked and the removal efficiency decreased with the increasing initial concentration 29 second concentration polarization would cause a decrease in the removal efficiency the rate of the target moving toward the electrode was slow when the initial an concentration was high 29 30 third the accumulation of intermediate products during parent molecule degradation which is performed on surface sites at the anode surface will further reduce the removal efficiency the higher pollutant concentration will lead to a more serious accumulation which is likely to counteract the beneficial effect of the increased reaction chances caused by the high an concentration itself 3 3 3 the effect of the support electrolyte concentration the influences of the na2so4 concentration were also investigated as shown in fig 6 the degradation efficiency varied depending on the applied support electrolyte concentration for both the recirculated filtration mode and the single pass mode the an degradation efficiencies in the runs with 0 01 mol l and 0 1 mol l were higher than that of the 0 001 mol l this was likely due to the addition of na2so4 which would increase conductivity of the solution and therefore increase the removal efficiency 29 when the supporting electrolyte concentration was 0 001 mol l the resistance was large the current was small and the removal efficiency of an was small however when the ionic strength increased from 0 01 mol l to 0 1 mol l the degradation efficiency stabilized and even slightly decreased this can be attributed to an increase of the force among ions due to an increase in the support electrolyte concentration 31 thus affecting the electrochemical treatment results the results suggest that a higher support electrolyte concentration will not consequentially lead to enhanced treatment efficiency too high of a support electrolyte concentration may cause a decrease in the ce as shown in fig 11 c due to the fact that industrial wastewater typically has a certain amount of background electrolytes it is very significant from a practical point of view to control the electrolyte concentration at reasonable levels 3 4 the effects of the running conditions 3 4 1 the effect of the anode potential potential is another important impact factor on pollutant electrochemical degradation because it directly determines the contaminant removal and side reactions as shown in fig 7 an removal exhibited a positive correlation with the applied anode potential when adjusted to 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 v in the recirculated filtration mode after 120 min of the electrochemical reaction the highest an removal ratio of 81 was achieved at an anode potential of 2 0 v this was consistent with the phenomenon observed in other studies 9 10 electron transfer mechanisms are generally classified into direct oxidation and indirect oxidation direct oxidation has a stronger surface site dependence while indirect electrooxidation is more dependent on the anode potential 9 it is believed that at nonactive electrodes the physio absorbed hydroxyl radical production increases and can oxidize more organics present in solution at a high current intensity 29 32 in this study it would be expected that the contribution of indirect oxidation to the an degradation would increase with an increasing anode potential overall the anode potential showed the similar effects on the an degradation in the single pass mode on the whole the removal ratio at the 2 0 v potential was higher than at the 1 0 v and 1 5 v potential although the effluent concentration lines interweaved to a certain degree 3 4 2 the effect of the water flux in this study the water flux of the electrochemical filter due to peristaltic pump suction reached up to 15 ml min water flux density 83 9 ml cm2 h without any air leakage or cnt membrane damage which was much higher than some typical electrochemical filters in the references listed in table 1 the highest water flux density reached 4 0 16 1 fold higher than those in the other studies the buckypaper membrane morphologies after filtration are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a the cnt membrane with a ceramic membrane support in this study was intact except for the indentation due to the separation layer however the free standing buckypaper membrane loaded in a commercial electrochemistry modified polycarbonate filtration casing as described in the references 7 17 20 21 33 swelled due to bubble accumulation fig 8 b the configuration with the ceramic membrane support perfectly overcame the drawbacks such as the limit of water flux bubble accumulation and cnt membrane fragility of the conventional electrochemical filter fig 9 shows the field emission scanning electron microscope fesem images of the cnt membrane before and after use in this study the cnts were randomly oriented and formed a porous 3d network before use the diameter of cnt arranged 0 02 to 0 2 μm and the surface of cnts was clean and smooth after use the 3d structure of cnt membrane electrode kept well in contrast the cnt membrane had a much rougher surface which could be attributed to the intermediates deposition and the oxidation of cnts to clarify the effects of water flux an electrochemical degradation was conducted at fluxes of 5 0 10 0 and 15 0 ml min in both modes according to fig 10 in the recirculated filtration mode the an degradation rates at fluxes of 10 0 and 15 0 ml min were obviously higher than that at 5 ml min this can be attributed to the increased mass transfer leading to increased reaction chances for an however the increase in the water flux would not increase the degradation rate of organic pollutants without limit the degradation rate at 15 ml min did not further increase further as expected and it was similar to that at 10 ml min or even slightly decreased such a degradation rate stabilization indicated that when the hindrance of the concentration polarization had been overcome as far as possible by improving mass transfer the hindrance of the chemical polarization a rate determining chemical step could not be controlled by the water flux in addition although high water flux can improve the desorption of reaction byproducts their accumulation likelihood still exists however ultra high flux may mean that an ultra short liquid residence time is required for an to be captured by the cnt to degrade furthermore the ultra high flux could generate possible compression of the cnt membrane thus lowering the membrane porosity and decreasing the effective internal electro transfer site 20 in the recirculated filtration mode the increase in the effluent an concentration with the increasing water flux could also be explained by the above assumptions in brief the impact of water flux on an degradation remains a complicated process 3 5 comparison of the different operational modes apparent ce a key indicator used to evaluate an electrochemical reactor has been widely used on a variety of occasions 10 29 39 40 in this study to further clarify the characteristics of the two filtration modes the apparent ce of a 120 min reaction was compared and is presented in fig 11 in general the apparent ces of the sing pass filtration mode were higher than those of the recirculated filtration mode with all the other impact factors being equal this could be attributed to the influence of the an concentration change during the reaction this is because in the case of the recirculated filtration the an concentration would decrease as the reaction progresses resulting in a decrease in the effective electron transfer for an degradation however in the case of the single pass filtration the influent of the an concentration remained constant thus the effective electron transfer might still have remained at a higher level this phenomenon was verified by the apparent ce decrease with the initial an concentration decrease in the case of the single pass filtration as shown in fig 11 a the effects of the initial ph fig 11 b the support electrolyte concentration fig 11 c and the applied anode potential fig 11 d on the apparent ce were not the same or similar in both filtration modes for instance in the single pass filtration mode the apparent ce varied considerably with the initial ph and the highest apparent ce appeared at ph 7 0 however in the recirculated filtration mode the apparent ce changed slightly this may have been due to the fact that in the single pass filtration mode the device is a system of relative stable influent water conditions such as the influent ph and initial an concentration according to cv results the current increases in acidic solution which would definitely result in a lower apparent ce value however it is a relatively closed system of unstable water conditions in the recirculated filtration mode in the recirculated filtration mode with the degradation of an a variety of intermediate products will certainly be produced and evolve and the solution ph will also change correspondingly these changes may cause accumulative effect and change the surface structure and chemistry of the electrode and affect the effective electron transfer therefore different effects on the apparent ce of an degradation appeared in two different operational modes overall in both modes the apparent ce decreased with increases in the support electrolyte concentration i e conductivity increase and applied anode potential which could be attributed to the more ineffective electricity consumption during the process the lowest apparent ce was found at flux of 10 0 ml min as shown in fig 11 e which could be attributed to the dual effects of increasing flux higher flux is generally assumed to have a stronger washing effect on the deposited intermediates to improve the effective electron transfer and apparent ce however the higher flux may also result in more oxygen evolution and other electron transfers while the reaction was occurring 27 and further decrease the apparent ce however the apparent ce cannot be used as the only indicator to evaluate different operation modes in the single pass mode the effluent concentration is generally much high due to the lack of accumulative effect of an removal therefore the recirculated mode is more appropriate for actual sewage treatment which needs to meet a discharge standard although the apparent ces of the single pass filtration mode were generally higher than those of the recirculated filtration mode 4 conclusions the ceramic flat membrane was used as the support for the cnt membrane electrode in an electrochemical filter the maximum water flux of the electrochemical filter reached 15 0 ml min 83 9 ml cm2 h without any cnt membrane damage which greatly improves the practicability of electrochemical filtration technology based on the cnt electrode the effects of initial ph electrolyte concentration anode potential and initial an concentration on an degradation were generally similar in both the single pass and the recirculated filtration modes the increasing flux increased the an degradation rate but the increasing effect of flux was not unlimited the recirculation filtration mode is more suitable for actual sewage treatment to meet a discharge standard although the apparent ces of the single pass filtration mode are higher declaration of competing interest the

13082,wastewater reclamation and reuse have been increasingly practiced in the u s as sustainable strategies to meet water demands particularly in regions threatened by water shortages however reuse of wastewater effluents wes as irrigation water e g in agriculture is challenged by the presence of emerging organic contaminants such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas whose presence may result in adverse impacts on crops soils aqueous ecosystems and human health thus it is important to remove pfas in wes before water reclamation and reuse in this study zero valent iron fe0 nanoparticles were investigated for their ability to induce pfas photocatalytic degradation in wes under ultraviolet uv light effective removal of pfas in wes was achieved at ph 3 0 in the uv fe0 system optimal degradation rates of 90 1 88 1 and 46 2 were obtained for pfna pfos and pfoa respectively each starting from 0 5 μg l using bare fe0 after 2 h the process is effective without oxygen removal and hence is a low cost method the used iron nanoparticles can be recycled by exploiting their magnetic properties the treatment method can also be successfully applied to the remediation of pfas contaminated groundwater and surface water keywords pfas photocatalysis zvi water reuse wastewater effluent 1 introduction about 70 of the world s freshwater usage is for agricultural irrigation in the u s this percentage is as high as 32 1 it is estimated that by 2050 70 more food production will be needed world wide to accommodate the rising population 2 which would require even more water for irrigation as water resources become scarce reclamation and reuse of water attract increasing attention to ensure a sustainable society increasing droughts in several areas in the u s and all over the world and rising demand for industrial water further make reclaimed water reuse necessary about 16 000 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps exist in the u s 3 that generate 12 billion us gallons of municipal wastewater effluents wes daily mostly discharged into rivers oceans or estuaries 4 safe and efficient reclaiming wes as a resource to irrigate agricultural land provides tremendous potential for water conservation particularly in communities regions and countries suffering from water insecurity 5 in fact reclaimed water from wwtps has been used in several u s states such as california and florida to irrigate a variety of crops 5 however reuse of wastewater may be compromised by contamination from pollutants even when detected at relatively low levels indeed a diversity of contaminants detected at trace levels exist in wes including per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas pfas are a group of contaminants of emerging concern cecs from increased anthropogenic activities that have received increasing attention due to their persistence bioaccumulation potential and possible adverse effects on living organisms 6 7 pfas comprise a large group of chemicals including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos which are included in the u s epa s contaminant candidate lists trace amounts of perfluorononanoic acid pfna also present widely in the environment from usage of aqueous film forming foam for fire fighting applications in wes from wwtps pfoa pfos and pfna are frequently found with 6 7 1050 ng l of pfoa 1 8 187 ng l of pfos and 1 2 376 ng l of pfna respectively being detected even after secondary and tertiary treatments 8 16 table 1 some of these concentrations are more than one order of magnitude i e ca ten times higher than the health advisory ha levels set by u s epa i e 70 ng l for a combination of pfoa and pfos and different states in the u s e g 21 ng l for pfna illinois epa thus it is critically important to remove pfas in wes before their reclamation and reuse as irrigation water as the current physical treatment technologies are either ineffective costly or generate ancillary waste streams that need to be further treated in this study a cost effective and environment friendly photocatalytic technology using zero valent iron fe0 nanoparticles nps under ultraviolet uv light was developed and investigated for its ability to remove and degrade pfas in reclaimed wes for water reuse in agriculture photolysis and photocatalysis for pollutant degradation have been widely studied 17 and are advantageous for contaminant degradation under mild conditions heterogeneous photocatalysis for pfas degradation can be conducted under a wide range of light wavelengths and has been demonstrated with relatively high efficacy 18 19 ferric ion mediated pfoa and pfos degradation under uvc light or solar light has also been reported previously 20 21 here using fe0 nps under uvc light degradation of individual pfas with different head groups and carbon chain lengths and a mixture of pfas in wes was investigated the influence of ph initial concentration of pfas treatment time and coating of fe0 nps were also investigated for achieving maximal removal of pfas in wes with the developed technology safe we reuse regarding pfas can be expected and increased we reuse may be triggered from its current low percentage of 1 in the u s the method developed in this study can also be applied to remediate groundwater and surface water contaminated by pfas 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater effluent we characterization total suspended solids tss and biochemical oxygen demand bod of wes from the two wwtps were determined following the procedures in ref 22 dissolved oxygen do and ph of the wes were measured using a hach hqd portable meter some of the characteristics of wes from the two wwtps are listed in table 2 2 2 pfas removal in the uv fe0 system quantities of pfas i e pfoa 95 pfos 40 in h2o t and or pfna 97 sigma aldrich of 0 5 μg l 1 0 μg l and 1 0 mg l were spiked individually or in combination into quartz vials filled with wes taken from two local wwtps in southern illinois wwtp 1 37 73358 89 16697 wwtp 2 37 74648 89 24263 the purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and performance of pfas degradation in realistic wes using the uv fe0 system thus it was more important to have known and variable amounts of different pfas in them but in the context of realistic and different environmental cofactors in the wes by spiking pfas to the present wes instead of seeking out other effluent samples that contain some random fixed levels and mixtures of pfas contamination greater control over the experiments was achieved a majority of the residential wastewater produced by the town is treated in wwtp 1 whereas a majority of the industrial wastewater and some of the residential wastewater produced by the town are treated in wwtp 2 after treatment a portion of wes from wwtp 2 has been reclaimed for irrigation of a golf course pfas were not originally detected in the wes from these two wwtps pfoa pfos and pfna were selected in this study as model pfas contaminants in part because pfoa and pfos have different head groups moreover pfna has a longer carbon chain than pfoa thus the degradation capacity of the uv fe0 system for these different types of prototypical pfas can be determined pvp coated fe0 nps 35 45 nm 1 w w polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp mw 10 000 coated u s research nanomaterials inc were sonicated at 20 khz for 30 min sonics vc505 500 w ultrasonic processor sonics materials inc newtown ct usa for proper dispersion of the particles then added to each reaction vial to reach the final concentration of 100 mg l bare fe0 nps produced according to our previous method 23 27 was used in comparison the vials were rotated in a photoreactor luzchem lzc 4x equipped with 14 uvc light bulbs 8 w each centered at 254 nm to provide a light intensity of 4 24 mw cm2 pfas degradation under uvc light without addition of fe0 nps was used as the control the impact of the initial ph of wes on pfas removal was studied with three ph levels of 3 0 7 0 and 10 0 the concentrations of ferrous iron fe2 and total iron i e fe2 and fe3 species in the treated water samples were determined by the ferrozine method used in our previous study 23 before starting the experiments presented herein pfas removal in the uv fe0 system had been tested in two batches one with two replicates the other with three replicates the anova test showed that there was no significant difference between these two batches i e the p value was 0 42 greater than 0 05 see supporting information tables s1 s2 in the experiments presented in this paper all tests were conducted with the presence of oxygen and performed at room temperature with duplicates 2 3 pfas sample preparation for lc ms ms analysis for samples loaded with a high concentration of pfas i e 1 mg l 100 μl of the sample was taken from each vial at certain time points over a 24 h period each sample was placed in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm eppendorf minispin plus microcentrifuge for 20 min to remove the fe0 nps in the suspension afterwards an aliquot of 20 μl of the supernatant was transferred to 150 μl of methanol in a pre washed vwr centrifugal filter with a 0 2 μm nylon membrane m8 pfoa or mpfos wellington laboratories inc canada was used as an internal standard 25 μl of 1 mg l of m8 pfoa or mpfos was spiked into the vwr filter then the filter was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min the filtrate was transferred to a liquid chromatography lc vial with an insert target glass microserts thermo scientific by a glass pasteur pipette the lc vial was then capped with a pre slit cap for samples loaded with a low concentration of pfas i e 0 5 or 1 μg l 20 ml of the sample was taken after 30 min or 2 h and then centrifuged under 14 000 rpm for 20 min to remove fe0 nps a solid phase extraction spe cartridge oasis wax 3 cc cartridge was used to concentrate the pfas for analysis 25 μl of m8 pfoa or mpfos 1 mg l was then spiked into the samples formic acid 2 v v in water was added to the samples to adjust the ph to 4 0 the spe cartridge was pre conditioned using 3 ml of methanol and 3 ml of water before loading the sample then 1 ml of 2 formic acid 2 ml of water and 2 ml of methanol were used consecutively to rinse the column 3 ml of 1 ammonium hydroxide methanol v v was then used to elute pfas and collect the fraction that was transferred to a glass tube and nitrogen gas was applied gently to dry the sample methanol was added twice to dissolve the dried sample which was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min in a vwr centrifugal filter before transferring to a lc vial with a final volume of 250 μl the concentrations of pfas and their degradation intermediates were measured by negative electrospray ionization esi in multiple reaction

methanol b with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min more details in ref 23 student s t test was performed for comparing the results under two different experimental conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas degradation in wes pfoa degradation was first studied at 1 mg l which was at least three orders of magnitude higher than its typical range of concentrations in most contaminated wes i e pfoa 6 7 1050 ng l pfos 1 8 187 ng l pfna 1 2 376 ng l 9 12 15 the initial concentration of do in wes for the test was 7 04 7 52 mg l the degradation rate of pfoa starting from 1 mg l using 1 pvp coated fe0 nps under uvc was lower in wes than in deionized water e g 58 2 of pfoa was degraded in deionized water after 21 h in the uv fe0 system in comparison only 38 7 and 31 1 of pfoa respectively were degraded in wes from wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 after 24 h in the system fig 1a likely reflecting the complex compositions in wes that can reduce photocatalytic efficiency these other substances in wes include but are not limited to natural organic matter nom inorganic ions and suspended solids indeed up to 2 60 and 1 10 mg l of tss and bod an indirect measure of organic matter and up to 6 53 and 2 77 mg l of tss and bod were detected in the wes from wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 respectively table 1 moreover the presence of suspended solids can increase the turbidity of the wes which may block the transmission of uv light similarly the presence of organic carbon may also absorb the uv energy thus competing with pfas for photocatalytic degradation fluoride ions f were detected as a byproduct in pfoa degradation and shorter chained perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas e g perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa and perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea were detected as intermediates in pfoa degradation both in wes and deionized water fig 1b d it was reported that the shorter the carbon chain length of pfca the less its cytotoxicity 28 31 ha or regulation levels of pfhpa with a combination of other pfas have been set by several states in the us for example a ha level of 70 ng l for a combination of pfhpa perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs pfna pfos and pfoa was established in connecticut usa 32 shorter chained pfhxa has not been reported as a carcinogen a toxicant or an endocrine disruptor 28 pfas and the intermediates formed in the reaction will be degraded with time ultimately to become fully mineralized to carbon dioxide fluoride ions f and sulfate ions so4 2 20 23 from a practical point of view however adopting a shorter treatment time by leaving end products like pfhxa and other pfas with shorter chains and much lower toxicities in the finished water is likely feasible 3 2 effect of initial ph of the wes at ph 3 0 starting from a mixture of pfoa pfna and pfos 1 μg l each 60 1 of pfna and 31 6 of pfos were degraded after 2 h using 1 pvp coated fe0 nps under uvc in we from wwtp 1 fig 2a these numbers were significantly higher than those obtained at ph 7 0 and ph 10 0 with respective p values of 0 032 and 0 048 for pfna and pfos for measurements at ph 7 and respective p values of 0 002 and 0 041 for pfna and pfos for measurements at ph 10 increased adsorption of pfas on the surface of fe0 nps due to increased electrostatic interaction between pfas and fe0 nps at lower ph 33 and increased concentration of ferric ions fe3 released from fe0 at lower ph likely led to faster pfas degradation therefore a ph of 3 0 was recommended for pfas removal from wes using the uv fe0 system since the original ph of the wes from the two wwtps were 7 20 8 10 ph adjustment was needed before the treatment however pfoa did not follow this trend fig 2a because pfoa was also one of the intermediates of pfna and pfos degradation it can be seen that the concentration of pfoa in the finished water was significantly increased after degradation of pfna and pfos fig 2a after only 30 min of treatment at ph 3 0 however no degradation was observed for this mixture of pfas in we from wwtp 1 in comparison this mixture of pfas was partially removed at the same condition after 30 min in we from wwtp 2 with removal rates of 28 4 for pfna and 56 2 for pfos fig 2b this difference again indicated the impact of the complex matrices in wes on pfas degradation it was likely that the delayed removal of pfas in we from wwtp 1 was due to the presence of other substances e g total organic carbon toc contained in that we in addition the removal rates using fe0 under uvc were significantly higher than those obtained under uvc alone for pfna and pfos fig 2b which showed the necessity of adding fe0 nps to provide ferric ions and possibly enhance the generation of hydrated electrons e aq used for pfas oxidative and or reductive degradation under uvc light 20 23 34 3 3 effect of coating of fe0 nps for a mixture of pfoa pfna and pfos with initial concentration of 1 μg l each higher degradation rates of pfas were obtained using bare fe0 nps compared to 1 pvp coated fe0 nps after 2 h at ph 3 0 fig 3a moreover using bare fe0 nps significantly higher degradation rates of 94 8 and 65 1 for pfna and pfos respectively were obtained with p values of 0 050 and 0 035 respectively fig 3a this improvement reflected the importance of exposing the uncoated fe0 to pfas and uv light in the degradation process 23 short chained pfcas pfhpa pfhxa and pfpea were detected as the main intermediates in degradation the respective concentrations of these substances were 0 32 0 04 0 06 0 01 and 0 06 0 01 μg l using 1 pvp coated fe0 nps when using bare fe0 nps pfhpa and pfhxa levels were measured to be 0 28 0 02 and 0 13 0 03 μg l respectively fig 3b in addition used iron particles were effectively separated from the treated water by sedimentation and application of an external magnetic field demonstrating the potential for particle recycling and reuse the combined concentration of fe2 and fe3 ions in the finished water after recovery of fe particles was lower than 5 mg l the recommended limit of total fe in reclaimed water for long term irrigation 35 thus the treated water can be reclaimed for irrigation despite the addition of low amounts of fe2 and fe3 ions by using fe0 nps no extra anions were brought into wes the phytotoxicity of fe0 nps is also low as demonstrated in our previous study 23 all of these properties of fe0 nps make the technology environment friendly and cost effective the powdered bare fe0 nps can be stored in air tight sampling bags to prevent oxidation before usage to determine the recyclability of fe0 nps for pfas degradation after each cycle of fe0 np usage the following three goals should be achieved 1 pfas degradation rates should be similar but not significantly reduced compared to those obtained using fresh fe0 nps 2 concentrations of fe ions in the finished water should still be significantly below the threshold levels required in the irrigation standard and 3 the magnetic property of fe0 nps should still be maintained for the purposes of recovery and recycling failure to achieve any of these goals would render the iron particles not suitable for reuse in that cycle 3 4 effect of initial concentration of pfas when the initial concentration of individual pfas was dropped from 1 0 μg l to 0 5 μg l in wes the degradation rates at ph 3 0 were further increased to 46 2 for pfoa 88 1 for pfos and kept unchanged of 90 1 for pfna after 2 h using bare fe0 nps fig 4 meanwhile the concentrations of intermediates formed were concomitantly reduced fig 4 it was worthy to note that since the standard deviations of the results in fig 4 were high the two initial pfas concentrations tested were in fact too close to draw a definitive conclusion and one can only speculate on the corresponding trends pfoa was detected as a degradation intermediate during pfos degradation which indicated the likely occurrence of desulfonation processes in addition to defluorination processes through h f exchange and cc bond scission processes that also took place in the degradation of pfoa and pfna 20 36 after 2 h starting from 0 5 μg l of individual pfas their concentrations dropped to 270 50 and 60 ng l for pfoa pfna and pfos respectively fig 4 the concentrations of pfoa and pfna were still higher than the us epa s ha level of 70 ng l for pfoa or and pfos and the ha level of illinois epa of 21 ng l for pfna in drinking water our previous study showed that pfas degradation followed first order kinetics in the uv fe0 system e g 23 when the individual concentration of pfas was as high as 0 5 μg l the reaction rate constants for pfoa pfos and pfna were determined to be 0 308 h 1 060 h and 1 151 h respectively in the we from wwtp 1 at ph 3 0 using bare fe0 nps under uvc therefore 6 4 1 9 and 2 8 h were respectively needed in the uv fe0 system to ensure that the final concentrations of individual pfoa pfos and pfna in the finished water were within the ha levels however a longer time would be in fact needed to degrade the intermediates formed in the degradation process before the water could ultimately be discharged for example starting from pfna degradation of the formed products like pfoa and pfhpa should also be considered to reach the ha or regulatory levels e g ha level of 70 ng l for a combination of pfhpa pfhxs pfna pfos and pfoa in connecticut usa however a combination of pfna pfoa and pfhpa of 80 ng l was reached after 2 h treatment in this study similarly starting from pfos degradation of the formed products like pfoa and pfhpa should also be considered in the treated water a combination of pfos and pfoa of 80 ng l was reached after 2 h which was still higher than the us epa s ha level of 70 ng l the degradation rates of individual pfas in wes in the uv fe0 system in the presence of oxygen followed the orders of pfos pfoa and pfna pfoa which showed pfas with a sulfuric head was degraded faster compared to pfas with a carboxylic head when their carbon chain lengths were the same moreover these relative rates indicated that pfas with a longer carbon chain was degraded faster in the uv fe0 system compared to pfas with a shorter carbon chain when they shared the same head groups in addition when comparing degradation of a combination of pfas i e pfna pfoa pfos 1 μg l each and individual pfas 1 μg l the presence of pfna and pfoa significantly impeded pfos degradation p 0 005 however degradation of pfoa was slowed in the combination due to generation of pfoa during the degradation of pfna and pfos figs 3 4 4 conclusion and future directions in this study the degradation of pfas was investigated in wes for wastewater reuse using an innovative uv fe0 system the degradation rates of pfas in wes were lower than that in deionized water likely reflecting the complex compositions in the environmental media pfas was better degraded at ph 3 0 in the uv fe0 system using bare fe0 nps compared to 1 pvp coated fe0 nps for initially high concentrations of individual pfas in the range of 0 5 1 0 μg l in wes a treatment duration of more than 2 h especially for pfoa was needed in the uv fe0 system to meet the ha levels for the individual pfas and their respective degradation products for lower concentrations of pfas in wes desired degradation levels can be achieved in a shorter period of time given that in most cases wes contain oxygen after treatment the present technology likely offers a lower cost option because it allows the presence of oxygen during treatment obviating an expensive oxygen removal step in addition to removal of pfas the photoreactor utilizing the present methodology is also efficient for bacterial inactivation for example 3 log inactivation of escherichia coli was achieved after 30 min for the wes

13082,wastewater reclamation and reuse have been increasingly practiced in the u s as sustainable strategies to meet water demands particularly in regions threatened by water shortages however reuse of wastewater effluents wes as irrigation water e g in agriculture is challenged by the presence of emerging organic contaminants such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas whose presence may result in adverse impacts on crops soils aqueous ecosystems and human health thus it is important to remove pfas in wes before water reclamation and reuse in this study zero valent iron fe0 nanoparticles were investigated for their ability to induce pfas photocatalytic degradation in wes under ultraviolet uv light effective removal of pfas in wes was achieved at ph 3 0 in the uv fe0 system optimal degradation rates of 90 1 88 1 and 46 2 were obtained for pfna pfos and pfoa respectively each starting from 0 5 μg l using bare fe0 after 2 h the process is effective without oxygen removal and hence is a low cost method the used iron nanoparticles can be recycled by exploiting their magnetic properties the treatment method can also be successfully applied to the remediation of pfas contaminated groundwater and surface water keywords pfas photocatalysis zvi water reuse wastewater effluent 1 introduction about 70 of the world s freshwater usage is for agricultural irrigation in the u s this percentage is as high as 32 1 it is estimated that by 2050 70 more food production will be needed world wide to accommodate the rising population 2 which would require even more water for irrigation as water resources become scarce reclamation and reuse of water attract increasing attention to ensure a sustainable society increasing droughts in several areas in the u s and all over the world and rising demand for industrial water further make reclaimed water reuse necessary about 16 000 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps exist in the u s 3 that generate 12 billion us gallons of municipal wastewater effluents wes daily mostly discharged into rivers oceans or estuaries 4 safe and efficient reclaiming wes as a resource to irrigate agricultural land provides tremendous potential for water conservation particularly in communities regions and countries suffering from water insecurity 5 in fact reclaimed water from wwtps has been used in several u s states such as california and florida to irrigate a variety of crops 5 however reuse of wastewater may be compromised by contamination from pollutants even when detected at relatively low levels indeed a diversity of contaminants detected at trace levels exist in wes including per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas pfas are a group of contaminants of emerging concern cecs from increased anthropogenic activities that have received increasing attention due to their persistence bioaccumulation potential and possible adverse effects on living organisms 6 7 pfas comprise a large group of chemicals including perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos which are included in the u s epa s contaminant candidate lists trace amounts of perfluorononanoic acid pfna also present widely in the environment from usage of aqueous film forming foam for fire fighting applications in wes from wwtps pfoa pfos and pfna are frequently found with 6 7 1050 ng l of pfoa 1 8 187 ng l of pfos and 1 2 376 ng l of pfna respectively being detected even after secondary and tertiary treatments 8 16 table 1 some of these concentrations are more than one order of magnitude i e ca ten times higher than the health advisory ha levels set by u s epa i e 70 ng l for a combination of pfoa and pfos and different states in the u s e g 21 ng l for pfna illinois epa thus it is critically important to remove pfas in wes before their reclamation and reuse as irrigation water as the current physical treatment technologies are either ineffective costly or generate ancillary waste streams that need to be further treated in this study a cost effective and environment friendly photocatalytic technology using zero valent iron fe0 nanoparticles nps under ultraviolet uv light was developed and investigated for its ability to remove and degrade pfas in reclaimed wes for water reuse in agriculture photolysis and photocatalysis for pollutant degradation have been widely studied 17 and are advantageous for contaminant degradation under mild conditions heterogeneous photocatalysis for pfas degradation can be conducted under a wide range of light wavelengths and has been demonstrated with relatively high efficacy 18 19 ferric ion mediated pfoa and pfos degradation under uvc light or solar light has also been reported previously 20 21 here using fe0 nps under uvc light degradation of individual pfas with different head groups and carbon chain lengths and a mixture of pfas in wes was investigated the influence of ph initial concentration of pfas treatment time and coating of fe0 nps were also investigated for achieving maximal removal of pfas in wes with the developed technology safe we reuse regarding pfas can be expected and increased we reuse may be triggered from its current low percentage of 1 in the u s the method developed in this study can also be applied to remediate groundwater and surface water contaminated by pfas 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater effluent we characterization total suspended solids tss and biochemical oxygen demand bod of wes from the two wwtps were determined following the procedures in ref 22 dissolved oxygen do and ph of the wes were measured using a hach hqd portable meter some of the characteristics of wes from the two wwtps are listed in table 2 2 2 pfas removal in the uv fe0 system quantities of pfas i e pfoa 95 pfos 40 in h2o t and or pfna 97 sigma aldrich of 0 5 μg l 1 0 μg l and 1 0 mg l were spiked individually or in combination into quartz vials filled with wes taken from two local wwtps in southern illinois wwtp 1 37 73358 89 16697 wwtp 2 37 74648 89 24263 the purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and performance of pfas degradation in realistic wes using the uv fe0 system thus it was more important to have known and variable amounts of different pfas in them but in the context of realistic and different environmental cofactors in the wes by spiking pfas to the present wes instead of seeking out other effluent samples that contain some random fixed levels and mixtures of pfas contamination greater control over the experiments was achieved a majority of the residential wastewater produced by the town is treated in wwtp 1 whereas a majority of the industrial wastewater and some of the residential wastewater produced by the town are treated in wwtp 2 after treatment a portion of wes from wwtp 2 has been reclaimed for irrigation of a golf course pfas were not originally detected in the wes from these two wwtps pfoa pfos and pfna were selected in this study as model pfas contaminants in part because pfoa and pfos have different head groups moreover pfna has a longer carbon chain than pfoa thus the degradation capacity of the uv fe0 system for these different types of prototypical pfas can be determined pvp coated fe0 nps 35 45 nm 1 w w polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp mw 10 000 coated u s research nanomaterials inc were sonicated at 20 khz for 30 min sonics vc505 500 w ultrasonic processor sonics materials inc newtown ct usa for proper dispersion of the particles then added to each reaction vial to reach the final concentration of 100 mg l bare fe0 nps produced according to our previous method 23 27 was used in comparison the vials were rotated in a photoreactor luzchem lzc 4x equipped with 14 uvc light bulbs 8 w each centered at 254 nm to provide a light intensity of 4 24 mw cm2 pfas degradation under uvc light without addition of fe0 nps was used as the control the impact of the initial ph of wes on pfas removal was studied with three ph levels of 3 0 7 0 and 10 0 the concentrations of ferrous iron fe2 and total iron i e fe2 and fe3 species in the treated water samples were determined by the ferrozine method used in our previous study 23 before starting the experiments presented herein pfas removal in the uv fe0 system had been tested in two batches one with two replicates the other with three replicates the anova test showed that there was no significant difference between these two batches i e the p value was 0 42 greater than 0 05 see supporting information tables s1 s2 in the experiments presented in this paper all tests were conducted with the presence of oxygen and performed at room temperature with duplicates 2 3 pfas sample preparation for lc ms ms analysis for samples loaded with a high concentration of pfas i e 1 mg l 100 μl of the sample was taken from each vial at certain time points over a 24 h period each sample was placed in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm eppendorf minispin plus microcentrifuge for 20 min to remove the fe0 nps in the suspension afterwards an aliquot of 20 μl of the supernatant was transferred to 150 μl of methanol in a pre washed vwr centrifugal filter with a 0 2 μm nylon membrane m8 pfoa or mpfos wellington laboratories inc canada was used as an internal standard 25 μl of 1 mg l of m8 pfoa or mpfos was spiked into the vwr filter then the filter was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min the filtrate was transferred to a liquid chromatography lc vial with an insert target glass microserts thermo scientific by a glass pasteur pipette the lc vial was then capped with a pre slit cap for samples loaded with a low concentration of pfas i e 0 5 or 1 μg l 20 ml of the sample was taken after 30 min or 2 h and then centrifuged under 14 000 rpm for 20 min to remove fe0 nps a solid phase extraction spe cartridge oasis wax 3 cc cartridge was used to concentrate the pfas for analysis 25 μl of m8 pfoa or mpfos 1 mg l was then spiked into the samples formic acid 2 v v in water was added to the samples to adjust the ph to 4 0 the spe cartridge was pre conditioned using 3 ml of methanol and 3 ml of water before loading the sample then 1 ml of 2 formic acid 2 ml of water and 2 ml of methanol were used consecutively to rinse the column 3 ml of 1 ammonium hydroxide methanol v v was then used to elute pfas and collect the fraction that was transferred to a glass tube and nitrogen gas was applied gently to dry the sample methanol was added twice to dissolve the dried sample which was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min in a vwr centrifugal filter before transferring to a lc vial with a final volume of 250 μl the concentrations of pfas and their degradation intermediates were measured by negative electrospray ionization esi in multiple reaction

methanol b with a flow rate of 0 2 ml min more details in ref 23 student s t test was performed for comparing the results under two different experimental conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas degradation in wes pfoa degradation was first studied at 1 mg l which was at least three orders of magnitude higher than its typical range of concentrations in most contaminated wes i e pfoa 6 7 1050 ng l pfos 1 8 187 ng l pfna 1 2 376 ng l 9 12 15 the initial concentration of do in wes for the test was 7 04 7 52 mg l the degradation rate of pfoa starting from 1 mg l using 1 pvp coated fe0 nps under uvc was lower in wes than in deionized water e g 58 2 of pfoa was degraded in deionized water after 21 h in the uv fe0 system in comparison only 38 7 and 31 1 of pfoa respectively were degraded in wes from wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 after 24 h in the system fig 1a likely reflecting the complex compositions in wes that can reduce photocatalytic efficiency these other substances in wes include but are not limited to natural organic matter nom inorganic ions and suspended solids indeed up to 2 60 and 1 10 mg l of tss and bod an indirect measure of organic matter and up to 6 53 and 2 77 mg l of tss and bod were detected in the wes from wwtp 1 and wwtp 2 respectively table 1 moreover the presence of suspended solids can increase the turbidity of the wes which may block the transmission of uv light similarly the presence of organic carbon may also absorb the uv energy thus competing with pfas for photocatalytic degradation fluoride ions f were detected as a byproduct in pfoa degradation and shorter chained perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas e g perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa and perfluoropentanoic acid pfpea were detected as intermediates in pfoa degradation both in wes and deionized water fig 1b d it was reported that the shorter the carbon chain length of pfca the less its cytotoxicity 28 31 ha or regulation levels of pfhpa with a combination of other pfas have been set by several states in the us for example a ha level of 70 ng l for a combination of pfhpa perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs pfna pfos and pfoa was established in connecticut usa 32 shorter chained pfhxa has not been reported as a carcinogen a toxicant or an endocrine disruptor 28 pfas and the intermediates formed in the reaction will be degraded with time ultimately to become fully mineralized to carbon dioxide fluoride ions f and sulfate ions so4 2 20 23 from a practical point of view however adopting a shorter treatment time by leaving end products like pfhxa and other pfas with shorter chains and much lower toxicities in the finished water is likely feasible 3 2 effect of initial ph of the wes at ph 3 0 starting from a mixture of pfoa pfna and pfos 1 μg l each 60 1 of pfna and 31 6 of pfos were degraded after 2 h using 1 pvp coated fe0 nps under uvc in we from wwtp 1 fig 2a these numbers were significantly higher than those obtained at ph 7 0 and ph 10 0 with respective p values of 0 032 and 0 048 for pfna and pfos for measurements at ph 7 and respective p values of 0 002 and 0 041 for pfna and pfos for measurements at ph 10 increased adsorption of pfas on the surface of fe0 nps due to increased electrostatic interaction between pfas and fe0 nps at lower ph 33 and increased concentration of ferric ions fe3 released from fe0 at lower ph likely led to faster pfas degradation therefore a ph of 3 0 was recommended for pfas removal from wes using the uv fe0 system since the original ph of the wes from the two wwtps were 7 20 8 10 ph adjustment was needed before the treatment however pfoa did not follow this trend fig 2a because pfoa was also one of the intermediates of pfna and pfos degradation it can be seen that the concentration of pfoa in the finished water was significantly increased after degradation of pfna and pfos fig 2a after only 30 min of treatment at ph 3 0 however no degradation was observed for this mixture of pfas in we from wwtp 1 in comparison this mixture of pfas was partially removed at the same condition after 30 min in we from wwtp 2 with removal rates of 28 4 for pfna and 56 2 for pfos fig 2b this difference again indicated the impact of the complex matrices in wes on pfas degradation it was likely that the delayed removal of pfas in we from wwtp 1 was due to the presence of other substances e g total organic carbon toc contained in that we in addition the removal rates using fe0 under uvc were significantly higher than those obtained under uvc alone for pfna and pfos fig 2b which showed the necessity of adding fe0 nps to provide ferric ions and possibly enhance the generation of hydrated electrons e aq used for pfas oxidative and or reductive degradation under uvc light 20 23 34 3 3 effect of coating of fe0 nps for a mixture of pfoa pfna and pfos with initial concentration of 1 μg l each higher degradation rates of pfas were obtained using bare fe0 nps compared to 1 pvp coated fe0 nps after 2 h at ph 3 0 fig 3a moreover using bare fe0 nps significantly higher degradation rates of 94 8 and 65 1 for pfna and pfos respectively were obtained with p values of 0 050 and 0 035 respectively fig 3a this improvement reflected the importance of exposing the uncoated fe0 to pfas and uv light in the degradation process 23 short chained pfcas pfhpa pfhxa and pfpea were detected as the main intermediates in degradation the respective concentrations of these substances were 0 32 0 04 0 06 0 01 and 0 06 0 01 μg l using 1 pvp coated fe0 nps when using bare fe0 nps pfhpa and pfhxa levels were measured to be 0 28 0 02 and 0 13 0 03 μg l respectively fig 3b in addition used iron particles were effectively separated from the treated water by sedimentation and application of an external magnetic field demonstrating the potential for particle recycling and reuse the combined concentration of fe2 and fe3 ions in the finished water after recovery of fe particles was lower than 5 mg l the recommended limit of total fe in reclaimed water for long term irrigation 35 thus the treated water can be reclaimed for irrigation despite the addition of low amounts of fe2 and fe3 ions by using fe0 nps no extra anions were brought into wes the phytotoxicity of fe0 nps is also low as demonstrated in our previous study 23 all of these properties of fe0 nps make the technology environment friendly and cost effective the powdered bare fe0 nps can be stored in air tight sampling bags to prevent oxidation before usage to determine the recyclability of fe0 nps for pfas degradation after each cycle of fe0 np usage the following three goals should be achieved 1 pfas degradation rates should be similar but not significantly reduced compared to those obtained using fresh fe0 nps 2 concentrations of fe ions in the finished water should still be significantly below the threshold levels required in the irrigation standard and 3 the magnetic property of fe0 nps should still be maintained for the purposes of recovery and recycling failure to achieve any of these goals would render the iron particles not suitable for reuse in that cycle 3 4 effect of initial concentration of pfas when the initial concentration of individual pfas was dropped from 1 0 μg l to 0 5 μg l in wes the degradation rates at ph 3 0 were further increased to 46 2 for pfoa 88 1 for pfos and kept unchanged of 90 1 for pfna after 2 h using bare fe0 nps fig 4 meanwhile the concentrations of intermediates formed were concomitantly reduced fig 4 it was worthy to note that since the standard deviations of the results in fig 4 were high the two initial pfas concentrations tested were in fact too close to draw a definitive conclusion and one can only speculate on the corresponding trends pfoa was detected as a degradation intermediate during pfos degradation which indicated the likely occurrence of desulfonation processes in addition to defluorination processes through h f exchange and cc bond scission processes that also took place in the degradation of pfoa and pfna 20 36 after 2 h starting from 0 5 μg l of individual pfas their concentrations dropped to 270 50 and 60 ng l for pfoa pfna and pfos respectively fig 4 the concentrations of pfoa and pfna were still higher than the us epa s ha level of 70 ng l for pfoa or and pfos and the ha level of illinois epa of 21

and 2 8 h were respectively needed in the uv fe0 system to ensure that the final concentrations of individual pfoa pfos and pfna in the finished water were within the ha levels however a longer time

13083,wastewater treatment using microalgae often produces effluents with unassimilated nutrients such as phosphorous with relatively high cost of harvesting process the current study aims to develop a fungal pellet that solubilizes phosphate as a bio adsorbent for enhancing microalgae harvesting process and additional removal of phosphorous to increase the harvestability of the algae and overcome the occurrence of unassimilated nutrients in the wastewater that often become problems in the algal based wastewater treatment system isolated strains with phospate solubilizing activity aspergillus niger f5 and aspergillus awamori f2 were found to show stable algal cells adsorption efficiency with less desoprtion as the increase of glucose concentration additional of a niger f5 pellets after the total phosphorus tp concentration became stationary in cassava wastewater treatment using chlorella vulgaris tistr 8580 was found to significantly increase tp and chemical oxygen demand cod removals another approach by co culturing the a niger f5 and c vulgaris tistr 8580 also increased the removal efficiencies but less effective in trapping algal cells however total nitrogen removal decreased with both methods of application with 70 adsorption efficiency the addition of a niger f5 pellets after reaching the stationary phase of tp removal in monoculture of c vulgaris tistr 8580 demonstrated a promising result for harvesting and enhancing the nutrient removal purposes algal fungal pellet application keywords phosphate solubilizing fungal pellet cassava biogas wastewater phycoremediation 1 introduction cultivating microalgae in wastewater as a part of treatment is an emerging method to obtain treated water that is safe for disposal while generating microalgae for biofuel and other bioproduct sources 1 the activity of microalgae in wastewater treatment systems has been studied for years microalgae consume many nutrients including phosphorus in soluble form 2 for years this capability has been used to treat wastewater with a biological approach nitrogen and cod removal are the main concerns in wastewater treatment however microalgae can only utilize phosphorous in soluble form such as dihydrogen phosphate h2po4 and hydrogen phosphate hpo4 2 3 4 this is a drawback when algae are applied to wastewater treatment with high levels of insoluble phosphorous lower uptake of phosphorous can also reduce the algal biomass yield as a consequence of lower biomass production the oil content for biofuel production is also reduced co culture of microalgae and fungi is an emerging approach to treat wastewater and obtain significant amounts of biomass pleurotus geesteranus and ganoderma lucidum were reported to remove nutrients in a biogas slurry by up to 75 57 and 67 72 respectively in combination with microalgal chlorella vulgaris 5 the application of fungi for microalgae cultivation has also been used for harvesting microalgae the fungi form a pellet structure that enables attachment and absorption of single cell algae 6 however additional ca 2 is required to optimize microalgae absorption onto fungal pellets 6 7 another obstacle to applying this approach is the requirement of glucose for pellet formation as reported for aspergillus oryzae 8 in wastewater treatment this approach has been tried using c vulgaris umn235 and aspergillus sp umn f01 to treat wastewater from a swine facility 9 thus one of the essential parameters to be considered is that the wastewater characteristics are suitable for fungal grown however this application only focused on the fungi as an absorbent while nutrient removal was done by algae earlier co culture of microalgae and fungi focused on fungi as an absorbent agent for algal cells which were responsible for nutrient removal the ability of fungi to solubilize phosphate has also been widely recognized and it has been applied for years to treat wastewater yin et al showed the production 1849 5 mg l 1 of orthophosphate from a medium containing 43 66 tricalcium phosphate tca by the fungus a aculeatus p93 10 similarly the fungi penicillium oxalicum and a niger were tested with an initial 5 g l 1 concentration of tca and showed high p releasing activity 11 penicillium sp pk112 and trichoderma harzianum omg08 performed p solubilizing in soil with a 1 3 to 2 g kg 1 initial polyphosphate concentration and showed a significant effect in providing sufficient nutrients for plants 12 production of cassava starch results in cassava pulp as the main waste cassava biogas wastewater is produced from the process of starch production most of the treatment procedures for this waste convert it to biogas the process begins with the production of tapioca starch from cassava tubers wastewater from this process is treated in a biogas generator to remove excess carbon sources during methanogenesis a significant amount of organic carbon is converted to methane nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous remain in the effluent use of cassava biogas effluent wastewater cbew is often limited to employing it as irrigation water after a time in conditioning ponds 13 separation process of microalgae from the culture consumed 20 30 of total cost for algal biomass production 14 another obstacle is the relatively low removal efficiency for some nutrients in the wastewater as forms ratios and amount of nutrients are significantly affecting the efficiency 15 several studies have addressed the lack of harvestability in the algal based treatment while others focused on increasing the removal efficiency of nutrients 16 the separation studies of the algal harvesting process and wastewater nutrient removal can dramatically improve only one aspect meanwhile the other aspect may not be solved or it leads to deteriorated results in some cases one of the studies that depict this problem was the significant increase of harvestability of c vulgaris by adding the pellets of a oryzae in the study of zhang et al 8 although the algal biomass recovery could reach 100 efficiency acidic ph 4 0 5 0 was substantially inhospitable for the alga to complete the removal activity process these situations prevent microalgae based treatment for being industrialized especially on coupling wastewater treatment system with biomass production this critical point shall be addressed to increase the possibility of the algal based treatment with biomass generation being industrialized among the critical gaps between excellent wastewater treatment by microalgae and the full scale application balancing the enhancement of the harvesting process and complete removal of wastewater content is the most demanding problem to be immediately solved 17 furthermore this problem can only be answered through a comprehensive study of algal nutrient removal activity the process of co culture and the harvesting investigation at the same time as it is described above fungal morphology and activity can address the separation process of the microalgae in algal based wastewater treatment however there has been no previous attempt to co culture fungi in pellet form with attached microalga in cassava wastewater thus the current study aims to develop a fungal pellet that can solubilize phosphate and adsorb microalga to harvest the microalga biomass and remove phosphorous from wastewater through the fungal pellet application solubilization of phosphate was expected to increase the removal efficiency of the phosphate by the algae furthermore the pellet form of fungi can act as a bioadsorbent to harvest the microalgae thus this study is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the co cultivation advantages of phosphate solubilizing fungi and green microalga in the wastewater unlike previous studies this co cultivation process did not only embody the superiority of fungi to adsorb the algae but also the advantageous trait of solubilizing phosphate from the fungi was successfully examined and further developed in other words the advantages of the fungi microalgae system in nutrient removal and harvesting processes were equally demonstrated 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling cassava biogas effluent wastewater cbew from korat flour industry co ltd nakhon ratchasima thailand was used throughout this study wastewater characteristics including its alkalinity total phosphates tp soluble phosphates po4 total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod were analyzed using the methods of 18 the results are reported in table 1 2 2 algal culture c vulgaris tistr 8580 was used throughout this study this alga was obtained from the culture collection of thailand institute of scientific and technological research bangkok thailand this stain was chosen based on its versatility growth under a wide range of nutrient sources 19 with high algal biomass yield 20 these advantages guarantee the applicability of this strain to be tested in the wide range of wastewater with the versatile application of harvested biomass the strain was cultivated in bg11 medium with a 16 8 h light dark cycle under 200 μmol m 2 s 1 of light intensity at 27 29 c 6 2 3 screening of phosphate solubilizing fungi indigenous fungi were chosen to be the algal co culture of this study the indigenous strain was widely known to have higher chances of remitting the wastewater and adapting to the actual condition 21 another reason is that no previous strain has been isolated or commercialized with the remarkable activity of solubilizing phosphate that is specifically suitable for wastewater remediation isolation of fungi was conducted by diluting wastewater and sediment samples from the sampling sites by factors of 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 and 10 6 potato dextrose agar pda was prepared as an isolation medium around 20 ml of sterilized pda medium was poured into individual plates approximately 200 μl of each dilution was spread onto the pda medium using a sterile glass bar after 2 5 days single hyphae of fungi on the pda was thus reinoculated onto new plates until pure isolates were obtained 22 screening of phosphate solubilizing ability was done using pikovskaya pvk medium this medium consists of glucose 10 0 g l 1 tricalcium phosphate 5 0 g l 1 cacl2 10 solution 0 5 g l 1 kcl 0 2 g l 1 mgs04 7h20 0 1 g l 1 mnso4 0 002 g l 1 feso4 0 002 g l 1 yeast extract 0 5 g l 1 agar 20 0 g l 1 with its ph adjusted to 7 0 by addition of hcl or naoh as appropriate positive phosphate solubilizing fungal strains present a halo zone around the fungal filaments 23 thus pthe hosphate solubilizing index was calculated based on the halo zone and the total fungal filament area eq 1 1 solubilization index d c d h d c 100 d c is the diameter of the fungal colony and d h is the total diameter of the halo zone 2 4 molecular identification 2 4 1 dna extraction dna was extracted based on the methods of 24 25 briefly a five day old culture of fungal isolates grown in potato dextrose broth medium was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to harvest fungal mycelium harvested mycelium was then crushed under liquid nitrogen and later suspended in an extraction buffer ctab 2 2 mercaptoethanol 2 nacl 1 4 mol l 1 edta 20 mmol l 1 and tris hcl 100 mmol l 1 the suspension was incubated at 65 c for 30 min before centrifugation at 14000 rpm extraction was conducted with chloroform and isoamyl alcohol in a ratio of 24 1 to separate the dna from other undesired compounds an equal amount of ice cold absolute alcohol was added to the aqueous phase with gentle inversion to precipitate the dna the pellets were washed with 70 ethanol the dna was suspended in tris edta te buffer with free water the purity of the dna was determined using agarose gel electrophoresis 2 4 2 dna amplification and sequence analysis the 18 s rrna region of each test strain was amplified using the primers ns1 5 gtagtcatatgcttgtctc 3 and ns8 5 tccgcaggttcacctacgga 3 26 dna amplification and cloning process were based on 27 with some modifications in volume temperature and cycling procedures briefly pcr was performed with a total reaction volume of 50 μl that consisted of pcr buffer 1 0 2 mmol each of datp dgtp dctp and dttp 0 5 μm of each primer and 1 5 μl of taq dna polymerase after initial denaturation at 95 c for 10 min 30 cycles of amplification denaturation at 95 c for 1 min annealing at 55 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 1 min and a final extension at 72 c for 7 min were performed in a simpliamp thermal cycler pcr machine thermofisher scientific usa the amplicons were purified using a gene all expin combo gp gel extraction kit geneall biotechnology korea purified pcr product was ligated into a ptg 19 vector before being transformed into escherichia coli dh5α after pcr and enzymatic digestion for confirmation the extracted plasmid was sequenced the sequence of the gene was analyzed using the ncbi blast tool https blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi a phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega version x mega usa after multiple alignments of data using the muscle tool evolutionary distances and clusters were constructed using a neighbor joining method and were evaluated using bootstrap values based on 1000 replications 2 5 pellet formation and adsorption capacity to determine the minimum required sugar content for pellet formation an experiment was conducted using the methods of 6 the fungal strains used in the current study were streaked onto a slant agar medium containing 24 g l 1 potato dextrose broth with 1 5 agar a fungal spore suspension was obtained by shaking the slant with 5 ml of distilled water and diluting the resulting spore suspension to approximately 104 spores ml 1 one milliliter of the diluted spore suspensions were then inoculated into 100 ml of bg 11 medium containing 5 g l 1 10 g l 1 and 15 g l 1 glucose in a 250 ml flask and shaken at 50 rpm for 3 days at room temperature the pellet sizes from each fungus and glucose concentration were measured under a stereomicroscope formation of pellets in the wastewater was also investigated using various concentrations of cbew briefly ten different concentrations of cbew ranging from 10 to 100 were prepared in different 250 ml capped flasks all the cbew concentrations were supplemented with 1 glucose a capacity of adsorption test was conducted to understand the amount of microalgae that the formed fungal pellets could adsorb and the time required to reach saturation adsorption pellets formed from three different concentrations of glucose were used to determine the absorption capacity after formation and harvest all the pellets were rinsed using sterile di water then they were inoculated into a 100 ml 14 day old culture of c vulgaris in a 250 ml flask the alga fungi adsorption test was conducted by shaking the suspension of algae and pellets at 125 rpm at room temperature 27 3 c using open air orbital shaker new brunswick scientific usa every 3 h as much as 3 ml of suspension was taken and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 680 nm to obtain the maximum adsorption efficiency the adsorption efficiency of the pellet was calculated using eq 2 2 ae x 0 x n x 0 100 ae is adsorption efficiency x 0 is the initial absorbance of algal suspension x n is the absorbance of an algal suspension at a given time 2 6 microscopic observation of algal fungal pellets after adsorption in the previous section three random pellets were chosen and prepared for observation under scanning electron microscopy sem a freeze drying method was chosen for sample preparation to observe the binding sites of algal cell walls to fungal filaments since the freeze drying method can directly immobilize and stabilize the algal fungal pellet specimens 28 the preparation of sample using freeze drying was based on 23 briefly three pellets were prepared in a freeze dryer alpha 2 4 lsc christ using a 0 011 mbar pressure with a shelf temperature of 20 c for 5 h after drying the pellets were sputter coated with gold neocoater mp 19020nctr for 2 min observations were done using an auriga sem zeiss with magnifications ranging from 2500 to 10 000 2 7 wastewater treatment of algal fungal pellets four treatments were applied to cbew fig 1 treatment i only utilized c vulgaris throughout the cultivation period treatment ii used the best performing fungal strain with no additional wastewater throughout the cultivation period the fungal strain was chosen based on characteristics that promote phosphate removal the strain was introduced in pellet form treatment iii was done by adding fungal pellets after phosphorous removal reached the stationary phase treatment iv used algae and fungus in pellet form from the beginning of treatment in treatment i as much as 50 ml of the algal culture in a bg 11 medium a680 0 75 was extracted and then c vulgaris biomass was added into 100 ml of cbew treatment ii was conducted by forming pellets using bg 11 medium supplemented with 1 glucose after a two day pellet forming period 50 pellets were taken and washed three times with sterile di water before inoculating them into 100 ml of cbew treatment iii was prepared in a similar manner as treatment i in stage i of the treatment after reaching the stationary phase of phosphate assimilation in stage i pellets were introduced into the wastewater to adsorb algae in stage ii of treatment iii the treatment was continued until the phosphate reached a stable concentration or was completely removed for treatment iv as much as 100 ml of the microalgal suspension with a similar concentration to treatment i was washed three times using sterile di water before being diluted in 25 ml of sterile di water fifty pellets from the selected strain were combined with the wastewater after the algal fungal pellets were formed they were inoculated into 100 ml of wastewater concentrations of orthophosphate cod tp and tn were measured daily absorbance of the culture 680 nm wavelength and total suspended solids were also measured using spectrophotometric and gravimetric methods removal efficiency r was determined using eq 3 3 r s 0 s x s 0 100 where s 0 is the initial concentration of a particular nutrient mg l 1 and s x is the unassimilated concentration of that nutrient mg l 1 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s test to identify significant differences between time for cultivation and changes in phosphorous concentration these analyses were commonly used to analyse the data from similar experiments 29 30 a p value 0 05 was considered significant analysis was done with spss version 16 0 a total of twenty four anova tests were performed for each isolate the time of cultivation was analyzed with three different dilution factors for each dilution factor the phosphorus concentration of the various strains was examined from days three to nine three replicates of each experiment were done 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial screening and phosphate solubilizing activity five fungi were obtained after an isolation process from cbew later they were tested for phosphate solubilizing activity using pikovskaya medium two of the isolated fungi showed a halo zone around the hyphae of the fungi growth and halo zone areas in the pkv agar medium showed that these fungi differed in their abilities to solubilize phosphate fig 2 nevertheless all the strains presented smaller halo zones compared to the mycelium area it was previously described that aspergillus spp penicillium spp talaromyces spp and gongrorella spp could mobilize and increase the phosphate intake in plants 23 31 phosphate solubilizing fungi excrete organic acids that break the p bonds from minerals or organic chains containing p 11 23 the sequence of 18s rrna from these fungal strains revealed that all strains belong to the aspergillus genus fig 3 strain f2 accession no mz359863 was closely related to a awamori eu667995 99 76 similarity while f5 accession no mz359863 was closely related to a niger mg889595 99 99 similarity aspergillus is a well known genus with versatile advantages in cropping systems the ability to solubilize phosphate by these strains was very limited based on their halo zones the solubilizing index for f2 and f5 were 2 12 0 11 and 3 36 1 12 respectively these values were similar to other isolates from the rhizosphere 32 thus the fungal isolates from cbew also possessed the ability to solubilize phosphate 3 2 pellet formation and characteristics a niger f2 and f5 strains were examined for their ability to form pellets in a basal medium containing glucose it was found that all the strains were able to form pellets pellet formation screening was conducted to obtain a minimal concentration of glucose necessary to form pellets glucose concentrations of 5 10 and 15 g l 1 were supplemented into basal medium to investigate the effect of sugar content on pellet formation and size it was found that the pellet size of the f2 strain became smaller as the concentration of glucose was increased however the f5 strain formed smaller sized pellets in 10 g l 1 of glucose followed by 15 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 table 2 fungal pellet formation was affected by the presence of organic carbon it was suggested that a higher concentration of glucose is beneficial to obtain rapid pellet formation 9 another study reported that formation of pellets was affected by adjusting the ph 8 however this method is not suitable for nutrient removal after pellet formation the ph of the medium after pellet formation was also related to pellet size pellet size was greater at higher ph values table 2 higher ph tends to neutralize the surface charges of spores and mycelia creating an isoelectric point so that the spores and mycelium did not repel each other 33 a series of dilutions ranging from 10 to 100 of wastewater supplemented with 1 glucose was conducted to obtain a potential substrate than can replace the bg 11 medium with cbew as a source of minerals for pellet formation one percent glucose was selected owing to the greater homogeneity of pellet size at this concentration table 3 it was found that the f2 and f5 strains only formed pellets in cbew concentrations of 30 70 and 30 60 respectively the absence of pellets in higher concentrations of wastewater might have been caused by the alkalinity of the wastewater table 1 at higher concentrations although the alkalinity enhanced pellet formation extremely high alkalinity could create a repulsive charges as negative ions were abundant at the surface of the mycelia 33 at lower concentrations there were inadequate nutrients to support pellet formation 34 3 3 pellet adsorption capacity the process of algal pellet formation were further observed using pellets formed in a basal medium at three glucose concentrations this medium was used to avoid additional compounds in the wastewater which can interfere with adsorption process the removal efficiency of the pellets showed different patterns in the first 2 h all the pellets showed high removal efficiencies up to 80 using the f2 and f5 strains grown with 5 and 10 g l 1 of supplemental glucose fig 4a b however algal cell removal by pellets grown in a medium containing 15 g l 1 of glucose only reached 78 efficiency after the same time intervals fig 4c removal efficiency is also related to the specific surface area and zeta potential of the fungal mycelium as the individual fungal pellets increased in size they had a larger surface areas per pellet so their capacity to adsorb and remove the algal cells from the suspension was higher the early stage of removal was typically related to physical mechanisms where the algae attached to the surface of the mycelium or became entrapped in spaces formed in the mycelium 6 another factor for consideration is zeta potential as this value is strictly related to ph 35 and the ph of the algal culture was nearly neutral 7 3 1 00 the surfaces of the fungal pellets determined the adsorption capacity in this early stage material with low ph was reported to have high zeta potential that can aid in attachment 36 comparing the ph values from media with three concentrations of glucose it was found that pellet size was inversely proportional to ph thus a higher zeta potential did not positively affect the adsorption so removal was greatly affected by pellet size it is notable that optimum removal in the current study was achieved within 4 6 h of mixing several previous studies that reported the optimal removal could be achieved within 12 h 36 37 after a six hour shaking period only the pellets formed with 15 g l 1 of glucose supplementation showed stability after removal the other two pellet types exhibited release of algal cells fig 4c it is well established that the physical mechanisms by which attachment occurs in the early stages are weak and thus this release phenomenon is possible 6 3 4 microscopic observations to further observe the mechanisms in the medium with 15 g l 1 of glucose microscopic observations were conducted sem images revealed several mechanisms that affect adsorption direct attachment of algal cells to mycelial surfaces was detected in some observations fig 5a however evidence indicates that some algal cells were trapped between other algal cells indicating no strong repulsion between the cells fig 5b this phenomenon also demonstrated that the zeta potential on the algal cell surfaces was not strong positive or negative alga alga cell attachment may be due to the neutral or acidic states on the contact surface 38 or an alkaline state that generates auto flocculation mechanisms 39 apart from physical attachment biological attachment were also found on most surfaces where the algae attached two molecular species were identified during these observations the first was a sponge like structure with a porous surface fig 5c which was prominent on most surfaces the other was a granular structure fig 5d here porous or wrinkled structures were tentatively identified as peptides or their derivatives while homogenous granules were expected to be saccharides as previously shown in sem imaging studies 40 41 these structures might have been derived from extracellular polymeric substances eps of the fungi since they were abundant in pellets formed with 15 g l 1 of glucose fungal eps has been reported on pellet surfaces of many studies this material commonly consists of polysaccharides and polypeptides 42 with high polarity 43 surface protein interactions and exopolysaccharide adhesion were also reported as alternative mechanisms of attachment of algal in pellets 16 eps plays an essential role in the adsorption capacity of algae onto fungal pellets where attachment due to eps reached levels of as much as 88 in comparison the other two factors zeta potential and surface area only accounted for 11 and 5 respectively of attachment 6 3 5 application of pellets in cbew the use of algal fungal pellets was further studied in an actual wastewater as demonstrated previously f5 had a solubilization index of 3 36 1 12 thus this strain was chosen for application in actual wastewater conditions four different schemes were tested to elucidate the effects of fungal pellets microalga and combinations of these organisms treatments i and ii were run to obtain a baseline removal by each organism treatments iii and iv were later done based on the results of treatments i and ii to obtain comparable results addition of fungal pellets in treatment iii must be done after the stationary phase of tp removal in phase i in treatment iv the pellets were earlier prepared as shown in fig 6 treatment i using c vulgaris as an inoculum showed removal of up to 52 of tp fig 7a interestingly the removal of insoluble phosphate a difference between total p and po4 was only 35 treatment ii in contrast did not show any significant removal of tp fig 7b addition of fungal pellets to adsorb the algae showed that insoluble p decreased to 93 fig 7c however in treatment iii the removal of po4 was similar to that of treatment i however treatment iv greatly removed insoluble p from the wastewater with a total p removal of 82 using the algae c vulgaris and the fungus aspergillus sp zhou et al achieved an 85 removal using diluted wastewater from a swine facility 9 similarly using 25 diluted swine facility wastewater aspergillus fumigatus and c vulgaris showed a 69 of phosphate uptake in a co cultivation process 44 guo et al reported removal of 85 of total phosphorus using a combination of the fungus g lucidum and the algae c vulgaris 45 overall co cultivation of algae and fungi in pellet form showed higher phosphorous removal than other treatments treatments iii and iv showed the highest removal efficiencies 78 and 82 respectively while the removal by an algal monoculture was only 62 a fungal monoculture was found to remove only 37 of phosphorous c vulgaris as a mixotroph culture showed a capacity to remove tp after a considerable time phosphorus is a nutrient that is commonly removed using an algal treatment system since these microorganisms have a phosphate uptake mechanism 46 however the remaining phosphorus in the water after c vulgaris reached the stationary phase of removal was still considerably high above the discharge standard here additional pellets in the stationary phase of phosphorous removal increased removal significantly almost reaching the removal using the co culture in treatment iv addition of the fungus a niger in the system allowed algae to utilize phosphorus in the wastewater that was not assimilated in the algal monoculture phosphate solubilizing fungi are known to be affected by their carbon source availability 47 as the carbon in the cbew consisted of hard to degrade carbon sources extracellular polymeric substances eps from the algae were abundant to support the solubilization activity of the fungi as preferring extracellular carbon energy 48 algal eps was also available in the co culture of a niger the chemical oxygen demand cod profile was also observed during the treatments fig 8a the cod profile showed fluctuation of the total organic components during treatment removal of cod did not occur in treatment ii treatment i similarly did not effectively remove cod from the wastewater additional pellets rendered a dramatic decrease of cod concentration after day 6 moreover the removal of cod in treatment iv was significantly higher than in other treatments treatment iv had a removal efficiency of 72 followed by treatments iii i and ii with removal efficiencies of 51 39 and 33 respectively a cod removal of up to 70 was previously shown using aspergillus sp and the alga c vulgaris 9 as much as 79 74 cod removal was reported in treated swine facility wastewater using g lucidum and c vulgaris 45 it has been reported that the removal of sugar from a medium was improved in the co cultivation system of algae and fungi and the removal by a fungal monoculture did not occur due to insufficient carbon 49 nitrogen removal during these four treatments varied treatment ii did not show any removal of tn interestingly treatment iv showed lower tn removal activity than treatments iii and i addition of fungal pellets on day six also inhibited tn removal fig 8b the highest removal was found for treatment i 73 followed by treatments iii iv and ii with removal efficiencies of 65 54 and 43 respectively wrede et al reported that the use of aspergillus fumigatus co cultured with thraustochytrid sp presented 86 removal of nh4 n in 25 swine facility wastewater 44 co culture of g lucidatum with c vulgaris demonstrated 74 28 removal of tn in a similar wastewater 45 concurrently a combination of c vulgaris and a niger removed only 23 of nh4 n in a diluted swine facility wastewater interestingly removal efficiencies of a co culture of c vulgaris and a niger were lower than in a monoculture of c vulgaris moreover removal of tn in treatment ii tended to become constant after a niger was introduced into the culture fig 8b this indicates that there was an inhibition of nitrogen uptake when these two organisms are co cultured the inhibition might be due to a reduced ph supplementary data 1 after addition of pellets that changed nitrogen uptake it was reported that the optimum ph for nitrogen removal in green single cell algae ranges from 7 5 to 8 5 50 as the ph did not meet the requirement for ion exchange and direct assimilation for available nitrogen the removal of nitrogen in the presence of a niger was lower than in a monoculture of c vulgaris treatment i the suspended solids in the wastewater depict the total biomass in the system total suspended solids in the system were observed to increase for all treatments except for treatment ii fig 9a addition of pellets in the algal suspension treatment iii showed a significant increase of biomass afterward the removal efficiency of the pellets was shown in the absorbance measurement of all treatments treatments i and ii were used as controls it was found that even though there was no significant growth of fungus in treatment ii fig 9a the a680 of this culture increased and then fluctuated throughout the cultivation period the additional pellets in treatment ii affected the od significantly reducing it to 0 129 however after a further three days of cultivation the suspension od increased to 0 224 removal efficiency decreased as the culture time increased in treatment iii indicating that the capacity of the pellets to hold algal cells was constant while the number of algal cells increased the algal cells in treatment iv outgrew the capacity of the pellets to hold them as a result the od in treatment iv increased gradually in line with the increased ss this phenomenon was also reported by xie et al they found that the adsorption capacity of pellets was lower than the available algal cells since the algae kept growing 49 removal of algal cells from the suspension was still high at the end of the cultivation period on day 10 treatment iii this result suggests that the pellets to hold the algal cells in their interior in addition to attachment at their surfaces however the increased algal cell numbers were too great for the pellets to hold due to insufficient surface area on the pellets conversely the algal co culture of treatment iv continuously increased its absorbance from day 1 this suggests that the cells or algal suspension generated during the treatment process did not attach entirely to the pellets a trend was observed in treatments iii and iv where the absorbance increased on day 1 treatment iv and day 7 treatment iii treatment iii showed promising results with high removal of algal cells from the suspension 70 and additional removal of phosphorus as much as 16 moreover cod removal was increased by 12 with addition of fungal pellets however the tn removal decreased by 8 with this addition in treatment iv all removal parameters were significantly increased except for tn which decreased by 19 the harvest process of microalgae was also considered an essential parameter in the current study the harvest of the microalgae in treatment iii achieved 70 removal of algal cells this result was better than for treatment iv result where the algal cells were abundantly grown outside the pellets thus there was no significant harvest in treatment iv however this treatment was applicable for solely utilizing fungus to enhance the removal efficiencies application of wastewater for co culture of algae and fungus was reported to achieve maximum biomass levels of as much as 4770 mg l 1 on a reactor scale 45 in the current study the highest result only reached 1273 mg l 1 co2 limitation might have played an essential role in elevating the maximum biomass concentration in the co culture process similarly the removal activity of pellets was lower than in previous studies muradov et al reported removal efficiencies of 50 90 using isolated fungi 51 zhou et al reported a removal efficiency of almost 100 by a oryzae 8 as well as by cunninghamella echinulate 49 and penicillium sp 52 using pleurotus ostreatus as much as 64 86 algal removal was achieved to produce an edible product 53 although the results of algal adsorption varied depending on many factors such as the strain used and physicochemical properties the additional removal of phosphorus with comparable removal using a niger f5 to harvest c vulgaris was remarkable thus using a niger f5 for dual purposes as a harvesting agent and additional phosphorus removal is recommended this is supported by the results of treatment iii after the cultivation period the results of wastewater treatments have shown improvement from the single strain treatment results biomass growth and nutrient removal among the treatments of c vulgaris and a niger combinations showed different removal traits and disparate growth nutrient removal efficiency and harvestability as the application of a niger at the stationary phase of c vulgaris phosphate removal occurred to be the most optimum for removal several key findings and prospective applications are as follows i application of the solubilizing activity as a primary mechanism of growth promoting activity of fungi to the algae shares a new perspective of co culture algae and fungi previously most co culture studies focused on the growth promoting signaling and growth hormones produced by the fungi to enhance algae growth 17 ii most of the fungi solubilizing phosphate created extreme acid conditions through organic acid secretion mechanisms 54 55 the acidic environments often lead to unfavorable conditions for algae to grow however the application of a niger did not show the extreme change in the wastewater medium that could be harmful to the alga this situation may have resulted from the low availability of degradable carbon sources available for the fungus thus the substrate with a limited carbon source for the fungi and proper nutrient concentration for the alga is essential to support the synergistic interaction between the organisms iii numerous previous studies emphasized the additional sugars on the wastewater to create filamentous pellets with high adsorption capacity 8 9 in this study the additional sugar for fungi would only be essential to form the pellets it is proven that the hyphae that formed during the co culture outside the pellets do not need any additional sugars to enhance the removal thus this advantageous trait of fungi can overcome the feasibility limitation of fungi as co culture of the alga iv the findings did not cover the actual wastewater content that may differ from sterilized wastewater however the positive effect of the co culture by adding fungi at the early stage of the stationary phase of phosphate removal indicates the promising result to be applied in the actual wastewater content the successful growth in sterilized wastewater can indicate the promising applicability of the system and the interaction between these organisms 56 v the combination of the c vulgaris with a niger can be adopted to the wastewater treatment with the excess phosphorus concentration thus this study s main contribution is the applicability of phosphate solubilizing organisms with microalgae to enhance phosphorus removal and increase the harvestability of the algae in other words this concept is also feasible to be applied in the system with fully established consortia 57 eventually this enhancement is also essential to elevate the affordability of biological removal of phosphorus by the algae in the wastewater compared with other established methods 58 overall coupling the algal harvesting process with the additional removal of phosphorus is demonstrated in the current study except for tn removal all parameters were enhanced by adding a niger f5 pellets in the stationary phase of c vulgaris phosphorus removal several vital points that need to be addressed further are highlighted based on the results i these findings show the benefits of algal based wastewater treatment for removing phosphorus this removal is often an obstacle as low removal efficiency is observed 46 however comparing the removal between the current results and well established consortia for phosphate removal the cultivation period becomes one of the significant issues a 10 days period of the removal was still lower than the combination of microalgae and suspended 59 or activated 60 sludges co culture for nutrient removals which only require less than a week here the acclimatization process for the alga may reduce the lag phase of the culture and eventually shorten the treatment period 61 ii the use of fungi for additional treatment did not affect the growth of algal cells even though the tn removal was slightly affected here ph adjustment and other operational parameters can be further explored to simultaneously improve all removal parameters including tn 62 iii the stability of the combination in unsterilized wastewater and its application in the continuous system is essential to be addressed further here application in the actual wastewater with a continuous system will be important for development at the pilot and actual scales 63 microbiome analysis for the system stability can also address the exact mechanisms of algae microbial interactions in the community 64 iv the formation of pellets using glucose is still not economically viable for industrial scale and thus affordable carbon sources for practical utilization can be further tested among the sources cassava wastewater from the starch extraction can be further tested for this purpose as it was previously reported to contain high degradable sugars contents 65 v the biomass generated can be analyzed to assess the chemical conversions of the process better this knowledge is important to decide how the biomass generated in such a system can be further utilized 66 additionally the economic value of generated compounds from the biomass can significantly reduce the total cost for this co culture application 4 conclusions aspergillus niger f5 was successfully isolated from cassava biogas effluent wastewater with promising phosphate solubilizing and pellet formation in a medium consisting of wastewater that was enriched with glucose the adsorption efficiency of the pellets generated from this strain was 73 81 depending on the glucose content employed during fungal pellet formation however only pellets formed in a 15 g l 1 glucose medium could hold the algae as they may contain eps to aid in attachment of the algal cells fungal pellets of a niger f5 were demonstrated to have dual advantages for algal harvest and additional nutrient removal in cassava biogas effluent wastewater addition of fungal pellets in the c vulgaris tistr 8580 culture increased the removal efficiencies of tp from 62 to 78 and cod from 39 to 51 nevertheless tn removal was lower with pellet addition than in the algal monoculture other algal cells also exhibited 70 adsorption efficiency at the end of a ten day cultivation or three days after pellet addition conversely formation of algal pellets at the beginning of the process did not show any adsorption this finding may

13083,wastewater treatment using microalgae often produces effluents with unassimilated nutrients such as phosphorous with relatively high cost of harvesting process the current study aims to develop a fungal pellet that solubilizes phosphate as a bio adsorbent for enhancing microalgae harvesting process and additional removal of phosphorous to increase the harvestability of the algae and overcome the occurrence of unassimilated nutrients in the wastewater that often become problems in the algal based wastewater treatment system isolated strains with phospate solubilizing activity aspergillus niger f5 and aspergillus awamori f2 were found to show stable algal cells adsorption efficiency with less desoprtion as the increase of glucose concentration additional of a niger f5 pellets after the total phosphorus tp concentration became stationary in cassava wastewater treatment using chlorella vulgaris tistr 8580 was found to significantly increase tp and chemical oxygen demand cod removals another approach by co culturing the a niger f5 and c vulgaris tistr 8580 also increased the removal efficiencies but less effective in trapping algal cells however total nitrogen removal decreased with both methods of application with 70 adsorption efficiency the addition of a niger f5 pellets after reaching the stationary phase of tp removal in monoculture of c vulgaris tistr 8580 demonstrated a promising result for harvesting and enhancing the nutrient removal purposes algal fungal pellet application keywords phosphate solubilizing fungal pellet cassava biogas wastewater phycoremediation 1 introduction cultivating microalgae in wastewater as a part of treatment is an emerging method to obtain treated water that is safe for disposal while generating microalgae for biofuel and other bioproduct sources 1 the activity of microalgae in wastewater treatment systems has been studied for years microalgae consume many nutrients including phosphorus in soluble form 2 for years this capability has been used to treat wastewater with a biological approach nitrogen and cod removal are the main concerns in wastewater treatment however microalgae can only utilize phosphorous in soluble form such as dihydrogen phosphate h2po4 and hydrogen phosphate hpo4 2 3 4 this is a drawback when algae are applied to wastewater treatment with high levels of insoluble phosphorous lower uptake of phosphorous can also reduce the algal biomass yield as a consequence of lower biomass production the oil content for biofuel production is also reduced co culture of microalgae and fungi is an emerging approach to treat wastewater and obtain significant amounts of biomass pleurotus geesteranus and ganoderma lucidum were reported to remove nutrients in a biogas slurry by up to 75 57 and 67 72 respectively in combination with microalgal chlorella vulgaris 5 the application of fungi for microalgae cultivation has also been used for harvesting microalgae the fungi form a pellet structure that enables attachment and absorption of single cell algae 6 however additional ca 2 is required to optimize microalgae absorption onto fungal pellets 6 7 another obstacle to applying this approach is the requirement of glucose for pellet formation as reported for aspergillus oryzae 8 in wastewater treatment this approach has been tried using c vulgaris umn235 and aspergillus sp umn f01 to treat wastewater from a swine facility 9 thus one of the essential parameters to be considered is that the wastewater characteristics are suitable for fungal grown however this application only focused on the fungi as an absorbent while nutrient removal was done by algae earlier co culture of microalgae and fungi focused on fungi as an absorbent agent for algal cells which were responsible for nutrient removal the ability of fungi to solubilize phosphate has also been widely recognized and it has been applied for years to treat wastewater yin et al showed the production 1849 5 mg l 1 of orthophosphate from a medium containing 43 66 tricalcium phosphate tca by the fungus a aculeatus p93 10 similarly the fungi penicillium oxalicum and a niger were tested with an initial 5 g l 1 concentration of tca and showed high p releasing activity 11 penicillium sp pk112 and trichoderma harzianum omg08 performed p solubilizing in soil with a 1 3 to 2 g kg 1 initial polyphosphate concentration and showed a significant effect in providing sufficient nutrients for plants 12 production of cassava starch results in cassava pulp as the main waste cassava biogas wastewater is produced from the process of starch production most of the treatment procedures for this waste convert it to biogas the process begins with the production of tapioca starch from cassava tubers wastewater from this process is treated in a biogas generator to remove excess carbon sources during methanogenesis a significant amount of organic carbon is converted to methane nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous remain in the effluent use of cassava biogas effluent wastewater cbew is often limited to employing it as irrigation water after a time in conditioning ponds 13 separation process of microalgae from the culture consumed 20 30 of total cost for algal biomass production 14 another obstacle is the relatively low removal efficiency for some nutrients in the wastewater as forms ratios and amount of nutrients are significantly affecting the efficiency 15 several studies have addressed the lack of harvestability in the algal based treatment while others focused on increasing the removal efficiency of nutrients 16 the separation studies of the algal harvesting process and wastewater nutrient removal can dramatically improve only one aspect meanwhile the other aspect may not be solved or it leads to deteriorated results in some cases one of the studies that depict this problem was the significant increase of harvestability of c vulgaris by adding the pellets of a oryzae in the study of zhang et al 8 although the algal biomass recovery could reach 100 efficiency acidic ph 4 0 5 0 was substantially inhospitable for the alga to complete the removal activity process these situations prevent microalgae based treatment for being industrialized especially on coupling wastewater treatment system with biomass production this critical point shall be addressed to increase the possibility of the algal based treatment with biomass generation being industrialized among the critical gaps between excellent wastewater treatment by microalgae and the full scale application balancing the enhancement of the harvesting process and complete removal of wastewater content is the most demanding problem to be immediately solved 17 furthermore this problem can only be answered through a comprehensive study of algal nutrient removal activity the process of co culture and the harvesting investigation at the same time as it is described above fungal morphology and activity can address the separation process of the microalgae in algal based wastewater treatment however there has been no previous attempt to co culture fungi in pellet form with attached microalga in cassava wastewater thus the current study aims to develop a fungal pellet that can solubilize phosphate and adsorb microalga to harvest the microalga biomass and remove phosphorous from wastewater through the fungal pellet application solubilization of phosphate was expected to increase the removal efficiency of the phosphate by the algae furthermore the pellet form of fungi can act as a bioadsorbent to harvest the microalgae thus this study is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the co cultivation advantages of phosphate solubilizing fungi and green microalga in the wastewater unlike previous studies this co cultivation process did not only embody the superiority of fungi to adsorb the algae but also the advantageous trait of solubilizing phosphate from the fungi was successfully examined and further developed in other words the advantages of the fungi microalgae system in nutrient removal and harvesting processes were equally demonstrated 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sampling cassava biogas effluent wastewater cbew from korat flour industry co ltd nakhon ratchasima thailand was used throughout this study wastewater characteristics including its alkalinity total phosphates tp soluble phosphates po4 total nitrogen tn and chemical oxygen demand cod were analyzed using the methods of 18 the results are reported in table 1 2 2 algal culture c vulgaris tistr 8580 was used throughout this study this alga was obtained from the culture collection of thailand institute of scientific and technological research bangkok thailand this stain was chosen based on its versatility growth under a wide range of nutrient sources 19 with high algal biomass yield 20 these advantages guarantee the applicability of this strain to be tested in the wide range of wastewater with the versatile application of harvested biomass the strain was cultivated in bg11 medium with a 16 8 h light dark cycle under 200 μmol m 2 s 1 of light intensity at 27 29 c 6 2 3 screening of phosphate solubilizing fungi indigenous fungi were chosen to be the algal co culture of this study the indigenous strain was widely known to have higher chances of remitting the wastewater and adapting to the actual condition 21 another reason is that no previous strain has been isolated or commercialized with the remarkable activity of solubilizing phosphate that is specifically suitable for wastewater remediation isolation of fungi was conducted by diluting wastewater and sediment samples from the sampling sites by factors of 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 and 10 6 potato dextrose agar pda was prepared as an isolation medium around 20 ml of sterilized pda medium was poured into individual plates approximately 200 μl of each dilution was spread onto the pda medium using a sterile glass bar after 2 5 days single hyphae of fungi on the pda was thus reinoculated onto new plates until pure isolates were obtained 22 screening of phosphate solubilizing ability was done using pikovskaya pvk medium this medium consists of glucose 10 0 g l 1 tricalcium phosphate 5 0 g l 1 cacl2 10 solution 0 5 g l 1 kcl 0 2 g l 1 mgs04 7h20 0 1 g l 1 mnso4 0 002 g l 1 feso4 0 002 g l 1 yeast extract 0 5 g l 1 agar 20 0 g l 1 with its ph adjusted to 7 0 by addition of hcl or naoh as appropriate positive phosphate solubilizing fungal strains present a halo zone around the fungal filaments 23 thus pthe hosphate solubilizing index was calculated based on the halo zone and the total fungal filament area eq 1 1 solubilization index d c d h d c 100 d c is the diameter of the fungal colony and d h is the total diameter of the halo zone 2 4 molecular identification 2 4 1 dna extraction dna was extracted based on the methods of 24 25 briefly a five day old culture of fungal isolates grown in potato dextrose broth medium was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to harvest fungal mycelium harvested mycelium was then crushed under liquid nitrogen and later suspended in an extraction buffer ctab 2 2 mercaptoethanol 2 nacl 1 4 mol l 1 edta 20 mmol l 1 and tris hcl 100 mmol l 1 the suspension was incubated at 65 c for 30 min before centrifugation at 14000 rpm extraction was conducted with chloroform and isoamyl alcohol in a ratio of 24 1 to separate the dna from other undesired compounds an equal amount of ice cold absolute alcohol was added to the aqueous phase with gentle inversion to precipitate the dna the pellets were washed with 70 ethanol the dna was suspended in tris edta te buffer with free water the purity of the dna was determined using agarose gel electrophoresis 2 4 2 dna amplification and sequence analysis the 18 s rrna region of each test strain was amplified using the primers ns1 5 gtagtcatatgcttgtctc 3 and ns8 5 tccgcaggttcacctacgga 3 26 dna amplification and cloning process were based on 27 with some modifications in volume temperature and cycling procedures briefly pcr was performed with a total reaction volume of 50 μl that consisted of pcr buffer 1 0 2 mmol each of datp dgtp dctp and dttp 0 5 μm of each primer and 1 5 μl of taq dna polymerase after initial denaturation at 95 c for 10 min 30 cycles of amplification denaturation at 95 c for 1 min annealing at 55 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 1 min and a final extension at 72 c for 7 min were performed in a simpliamp thermal cycler pcr machine thermofisher scientific usa the amplicons were purified using a gene all expin combo gp gel extraction kit geneall biotechnology korea purified pcr product was ligated into a ptg 19 vector before being transformed into escherichia coli dh5α after pcr and enzymatic digestion for confirmation the extracted plasmid was sequenced the sequence of the gene was analyzed using the ncbi blast tool https blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi a phylogenetic tree was constructed using mega version x mega usa after multiple alignments of data using the muscle tool evolutionary distances and clusters were constructed using a neighbor joining method and were evaluated using bootstrap values based on 1000 replications 2 5 pellet formation and adsorption capacity to determine the minimum required sugar content for pellet formation an experiment was conducted using the methods of 6 the fungal strains used in the current study were streaked onto a slant agar medium containing 24 g l 1 potato dextrose broth with 1 5 agar a fungal spore suspension was obtained by shaking the slant with 5 ml of distilled water and diluting the resulting spore suspension to approximately 104 spores ml 1 one milliliter of the diluted spore suspensions were then inoculated into 100 ml of bg 11 medium containing 5 g l 1 10 g l 1 and 15 g l 1 glucose in a 250 ml flask and shaken at 50 rpm for 3 days at room temperature the pellet sizes from each fungus and glucose concentration were measured under a stereomicroscope formation of pellets in the wastewater was also investigated using various concentrations of cbew briefly ten different concentrations of cbew ranging from 10 to 100 were prepared in different 250 ml capped flasks all the cbew concentrations were supplemented with 1 glucose a capacity of adsorption test was conducted to understand the amount of microalgae that the formed fungal pellets could adsorb and the time required to reach saturation adsorption pellets formed from three different concentrations of glucose were used to determine the absorption capacity after formation and harvest all the pellets were rinsed using sterile di water then they were inoculated into a 100 ml 14 day old culture of c vulgaris in a 250 ml flask the alga fungi adsorption test was conducted by shaking the suspension of algae and pellets at 125 rpm at room temperature 27 3 c using open air orbital shaker new brunswick scientific usa every 3 h as much as 3 ml of suspension was taken and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 680 nm to obtain the maximum adsorption efficiency the adsorption efficiency of the pellet was calculated using eq 2 2 ae x 0 x n x 0 100 ae is adsorption efficiency x 0 is the initial absorbance of algal suspension x n is the absorbance of an algal suspension at a given time 2 6 microscopic observation of algal fungal pellets after adsorption in the previous section three random pellets were chosen and prepared for observation under scanning electron microscopy sem a freeze drying method was chosen for sample preparation to observe the binding sites of algal cell walls to fungal filaments since the freeze drying method can directly immobilize and stabilize the algal fungal pellet specimens 28 the preparation of sample using freeze drying was based on 23 briefly three pellets were prepared in a freeze dryer alpha 2 4 lsc christ using a 0 011 mbar pressure with a shelf temperature of 20 c for 5 h after drying the pellets were sputter coated with gold neocoater mp 19020nctr for 2 min observations were done using an auriga sem zeiss with magnifications ranging from 2500 to 10 000 2 7 wastewater treatment of algal fungal pellets four treatments were applied to cbew fig 1 treatment i only utilized c vulgaris throughout the cultivation period treatment ii used the best performing fungal strain with no additional wastewater throughout the cultivation period the fungal strain was chosen based on characteristics that promote phosphate removal the strain was introduced in pellet form treatment iii was done by adding fungal pellets after phosphorous removal reached the stationary phase treatment iv used algae and fungus in pellet form from the beginning of treatment in treatment i as much as 50 ml of the algal culture in a bg 11 medium a680 0 75 was extracted and then c vulgaris biomass was added into 100 ml of cbew treatment ii was conducted by forming pellets using bg 11 medium supplemented with 1 glucose after a two day pellet forming period 50 pellets were taken and washed three times with sterile di water before inoculating them into 100 ml of cbew treatment iii was prepared in a similar manner as treatment i in stage i of the treatment after reaching the stationary phase of phosphate assimilation in stage i pellets were introduced into the wastewater to adsorb algae in stage ii of treatment iii the treatment was continued until the phosphate reached a stable concentration or was completely removed for treatment iv as much as 100 ml of the microalgal suspension with a similar concentration to treatment i was washed three times using sterile di water before being diluted in 25 ml of sterile di water fifty pellets from the selected strain were combined with the wastewater after the algal fungal pellets were formed they were inoculated into 100 ml of wastewater concentrations of orthophosphate cod tp and tn were measured daily absorbance of the culture 680 nm wavelength and total suspended solids were also measured using spectrophotometric and gravimetric methods removal efficiency r was determined using eq 3 3 r s 0 s x s 0 100 where s 0 is the initial concentration of a particular nutrient mg l 1 and s x is the unassimilated concentration of that nutrient mg l 1 2 8 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s test to identify significant differences between time for cultivation and changes in phosphorous concentration these analyses were commonly used to analyse the data from similar experiments 29 30 a p value 0 05 was considered significant analysis was done with spss version 16 0 a total of twenty four anova tests were performed for each isolate the time of cultivation was analyzed with three different dilution factors for each dilution factor the phosphorus concentration of the various strains was examined from days three to nine three replicates of each experiment were done 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial screening and phosphate solubilizing activity five fungi were obtained after an isolation process from cbew later they were tested for phosphate solubilizing activity using pikovskaya medium two of the isolated fungi showed a halo zone around the hyphae of the fungi growth and halo zone areas in the pkv agar medium showed that these fungi differed in their abilities to solubilize phosphate fig 2 nevertheless all the strains presented smaller halo zones compared to the mycelium area it was previously described that aspergillus spp penicillium spp talaromyces spp and gongrorella spp could mobilize and increase the phosphate intake in plants 23 31 phosphate solubilizing fungi excrete organic acids that break the p bonds from minerals or organic chains containing p 11 23 the sequence of 18s rrna from these fungal strains revealed that all strains belong to the aspergillus genus fig 3 strain f2 accession no mz359863 was closely related to a awamori eu667995 99 76 similarity while f5 accession no mz359863 was closely related to a niger mg889595 99 99 similarity aspergillus is a well known genus with versatile advantages in cropping systems the ability to solubilize phosphate by these strains was very limited based on their halo zones the solubilizing index for f2 and f5 were 2 12 0 11 and 3 36 1 12 respectively these values were similar to other isolates from the rhizosphere 32 thus the fungal isolates from cbew also possessed the ability to solubilize phosphate 3 2 pellet formation and characteristics a niger f2 and f5 strains were examined for their ability to form pellets in a basal medium containing glucose it was found that all the strains were able to form pellets pellet formation screening was conducted to obtain a minimal concentration of glucose necessary to form pellets glucose concentrations of 5 10 and 15 g l 1 were supplemented into basal medium to investigate the effect of sugar content on pellet formation and size it was found that the pellet size of the f2 strain became smaller as the concentration of glucose was increased however the f5 strain formed smaller sized pellets in 10 g l 1 of glucose followed by 15 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 table 2 fungal pellet formation was affected by the presence of organic carbon it was suggested that a higher concentration of glucose is beneficial to obtain rapid pellet formation 9 another study reported that formation of pellets was affected by adjusting the ph 8 however this method is not suitable for nutrient removal after pellet formation the ph of the medium after pellet formation was also related to pellet size pellet size was greater at higher ph values table 2 higher ph tends to neutralize the surface charges of spores and mycelia creating an isoelectric point so that the spores and mycelium did not repel each other 33 a series of dilutions ranging from 10 to 100 of wastewater supplemented with 1 glucose was conducted to obtain a potential substrate than can replace the bg 11 medium with cbew as a source of minerals for pellet formation one percent glucose was selected owing to the greater homogeneity of pellet size at this concentration table 3 it was found that the f2 and f5 strains only formed pellets in cbew concentrations of 30 70 and 30 60 respectively the absence of pellets in higher concentrations of wastewater might have been caused by the alkalinity of the wastewater table 1 at higher concentrations although the alkalinity enhanced pellet formation extremely high alkalinity could create a repulsive charges as negative ions were abundant at the surface of the mycelia 33 at lower concentrations there were inadequate nutrients to support pellet formation 34 3 3 pellet adsorption capacity the process of algal pellet formation were further observed using pellets formed in a basal medium at three glucose concentrations this medium was used to avoid additional compounds in the wastewater which can interfere with adsorption process the removal efficiency of the pellets showed different patterns in the first 2 h all the pellets showed high removal efficiencies up to 80 using the f2 and f5 strains grown with 5 and 10 g l 1 of supplemental glucose fig 4a b however algal cell removal by pellets grown in a medium containing 15 g l 1 of glucose only reached 78 efficiency after the same time intervals fig 4c removal efficiency is also related to the specific surface area and zeta potential of the fungal mycelium as the individual fungal pellets increased in size they had a larger surface areas per pellet so their capacity to adsorb and remove the algal cells from the suspension was higher the early stage of removal was typically related to physical mechanisms where the algae attached to the surface of the mycelium or became entrapped in spaces formed in the mycelium 6 another factor for consideration is zeta potential as this value is strictly related to ph 35 and the ph of the algal culture was nearly neutral 7 3 1 00 the surfaces of the fungal pellets determined the adsorption capacity in this early stage material with low ph was reported to have high zeta potential that can aid in attachment 36 comparing the ph values from media with three concentrations of glucose it was found that pellet size was inversely proportional to ph thus a higher zeta potential did not positively affect the adsorption so removal was greatly affected by pellet size it is notable that optimum removal in the current study was achieved within 4 6 h of mixing several previous studies that reported the optimal removal could be achieved within 12 h 36 37 after a six hour shaking period only the pellets formed with 15 g l 1 of glucose supplementation showed stability after removal the other two pellet types exhibited release of algal cells fig 4c it is well established that the physical mechanisms by which attachment occurs in the early stages are weak and thus this release phenomenon is possible 6 3 4 microscopic observations to further observe the mechanisms in the medium with 15 g l 1 of glucose microscopic observations were conducted sem images revealed several mechanisms that affect adsorption direct attachment of algal cells to mycelial surfaces was detected in some observations fig 5a however evidence indicates that some algal cells were trapped between other algal cells indicating no strong repulsion between the cells fig 5b this phenomenon also demonstrated that the zeta potential on the algal cell surfaces was not strong positive or negative alga alga cell attachment may be due to the neutral or acidic states on the contact surface 38 or an alkaline state that generates auto flocculation mechanisms 39 apart from physical attachment biological attachment were also found on most surfaces where the algae attached two molecular species were identified during these observations the first was a sponge like structure with a porous surface fig 5c which was prominent on most surfaces the other was a granular structure fig 5d here porous or wrinkled structures were tentatively identified as peptides or their derivatives while homogenous granules were expected to be saccharides as previously shown in sem imaging studies 40 41 these structures might have been derived from extracellular polymeric substances eps of the fungi since they were abundant in pellets formed with 15 g l 1 of glucose fungal eps has been reported on pellet surfaces of many studies this material commonly consists of polysaccharides and polypeptides 42 with high polarity 43 surface protein interactions and exopolysaccharide adhesion were also reported as alternative mechanisms of attachment of algal in pellets 16 eps plays an essential role in the adsorption capacity of algae onto fungal pellets where attachment due to eps reached levels of as much as 88 in comparison the other two factors zeta potential and surface area only accounted for 11 and 5 respectively of attachment 6 3 5 application of pellets in cbew the use of algal fungal pellets was further studied in an actual wastewater as demonstrated previously f5 had a solubilization index of 3 36 1 12 thus this strain was chosen for application in actual wastewater conditions four different schemes were tested to elucidate the effects of fungal pellets microalga and combinations of these organisms treatments i and ii were run to obtain a baseline removal by each organism treatments iii and iv were later done based on the results of treatments i and ii to obtain comparable results addition of fungal pellets in treatment iii must be done after the stationary phase of tp removal in phase i in treatment iv the pellets were earlier prepared as shown in fig 6 treatment i using c vulgaris as an inoculum showed removal of up to 52 of tp fig 7a interestingly the removal of insoluble phosphate a difference between total p and po4 was only 35 treatment ii in contrast did not show any significant removal of tp fig 7b addition of fungal pellets to adsorb the algae showed that insoluble p decreased to 93 fig 7c however in treatment iii the removal of po4 was similar to that of treatment i however treatment iv greatly removed insoluble p from the wastewater with a total p removal of 82 using the algae c vulgaris and the fungus aspergillus sp zhou et al achieved an 85 removal using diluted wastewater from a swine facility 9 similarly using 25 diluted swine facility wastewater aspergillus fumigatus and c vulgaris showed a 69 of phosphate uptake in a co cultivation process 44 guo et al reported removal of 85 of total phosphorus using a combination of the fungus g lucidum and the algae c vulgaris 45 overall co cultivation of algae and fungi in pellet form showed higher phosphorous removal than other treatments treatments iii and iv showed the highest removal efficiencies 78 and 82 respectively while the removal by an algal monoculture was only 62 a fungal monoculture was found to remove only 37 of phosphorous c vulgaris as a mixotroph culture showed a capacity to remove tp after a considerable time phosphorus is a nutrient that is commonly removed using an algal treatment system since these microorganisms have a phosphate uptake mechanism 46 however the remaining phosphorus in the water after c vulgaris reached the stationary phase of removal was still considerably high above the discharge standard here additional pellets in the stationary phase of phosphorous removal increased removal significantly almost reaching the removal using the co culture in treatment iv addition of the fungus a niger in the system allowed algae to utilize phosphorus in the wastewater that was not assimilated in the algal monoculture phosphate solubilizing fungi are known to be affected by their carbon source availability 47 as the carbon in the cbew consisted of hard to degrade carbon sources extracellular polymeric substances eps from the algae were abundant to support the solubilization activity of the fungi as preferring extracellular carbon energy 48 algal eps was also available in the co culture of a niger the chemical oxygen demand cod profile was also observed during the treatments fig 8a the cod profile showed fluctuation of the total organic components during treatment removal of cod did not occur in treatment ii treatment i similarly did not effectively remove cod from the wastewater additional pellets rendered a dramatic decrease of cod concentration after day 6 moreover the removal of cod in treatment iv was significantly higher than in other treatments treatment iv had a removal efficiency of 72 followed by treatments iii i and ii with removal efficiencies of 51 39 and 33 respectively a cod removal of up to 70 was previously shown using aspergillus sp and the alga c vulgaris 9 as much as 79 74 cod removal was reported in treated swine facility wastewater using g lucidum and c vulgaris 45 it has been reported that the removal of sugar from a medium was improved in the co cultivation system of algae and fungi and the removal by a fungal monoculture did not occur due to insufficient carbon 49 nitrogen removal during these four treatments varied treatment ii did not show any removal of tn interestingly treatment iv showed lower tn removal activity than treatments iii and i addition of fungal pellets on day six also inhibited tn removal fig 8b the highest removal was found for treatment i 73 followed by treatments iii iv and ii with removal efficiencies of 65 54 and 43 respectively wrede et al reported that the use of aspergillus fumigatus co cultured with thraustochytrid sp presented 86 removal of nh4 n in 25 swine facility wastewater 44 co culture of g lucidatum with c vulgaris demonstrated 74 28 removal of tn in a similar wastewater 45 concurrently a combination of c vulgaris and a niger removed only 23 of nh4 n in a diluted swine facility wastewater interestingly removal efficiencies of a co culture of c vulgaris and a niger were lower than in a monoculture of c vulgaris moreover removal of tn in treatment ii tended to become constant after a niger was introduced into the culture fig 8b this indicates that there was an inhibition of nitrogen uptake when these two organisms are co cultured the inhibition might be due to a reduced ph supplementary data 1 after addition of pellets that changed nitrogen uptake it was reported that the optimum ph for nitrogen removal in green single cell algae ranges from 7 5 to 8 5 50 as the ph did not meet the requirement for ion exchange and direct assimilation for available nitrogen the removal of nitrogen in the presence of a niger was lower than in a monoculture of c vulgaris treatment i the suspended solids in the wastewater depict the total biomass in the system total suspended solids in the system were observed to increase for all treatments except for treatment ii fig 9a addition of pellets in the algal suspension treatment iii showed a significant increase of biomass afterward the removal efficiency of the pellets was shown in the absorbance measurement of all treatments treatments i and ii were used as controls it was found that even though there was no significant growth of fungus in treatment ii fig 9a the a680 of this culture increased and then fluctuated throughout the cultivation period the additional pellets in treatment ii affected the od significantly reducing it to 0 129 however after a further three days of cultivation the suspension od increased to 0 224 removal efficiency decreased as the culture time increased in treatment iii indicating that the capacity of the pellets to hold algal cells was constant while the number of algal cells increased the algal cells in treatment iv outgrew the capacity of the pellets to hold them as a result the od in treatment iv increased gradually in line with the increased ss this phenomenon was also reported by xie et al they found that the adsorption capacity of pellets was lower than the available algal cells since the algae kept growing 49 removal of algal cells from the suspension was still high at the end of the cultivation period on day 10 treatment iii this result suggests that the pellets to hold the algal cells in their interior in addition to attachment at their surfaces however the increased algal cell numbers were too great for the pellets to hold due to insufficient surface area on the pellets conversely the algal co culture of treatment iv continuously increased its absorbance from day 1 this suggests that the cells or algal suspension generated during the treatment process did not attach entirely to the pellets a trend was observed in treatments iii and iv where the absorbance increased on day 1 treatment iv and day 7 treatment iii treatment iii showed promising results with high removal of algal cells from the suspension 70 and additional removal of phosphorus as much as 16 moreover cod removal was increased by 12 with addition of fungal pellets however the tn removal decreased by 8 with this addition in treatment iv all removal parameters were significantly increased except for tn which decreased by 19 the harvest process of microalgae was also considered an essential parameter in the current study the harvest of the microalgae in treatment iii achieved 70 removal of algal cells this result was better than for treatment iv result where the algal cells were abundantly grown outside the pellets thus there was no significant harvest in treatment iv however this treatment was applicable for solely utilizing fungus to enhance the removal efficiencies application of wastewater for co culture of algae and fungus was reported to achieve maximum biomass levels of as much as 4770 mg l 1 on a reactor scale 45 in the current study the highest result only reached 1273 mg l 1 co2 limitation might have played an essential role in elevating the maximum biomass concentration in the co culture process similarly the removal activity of pellets was lower than in previous studies muradov et al reported removal efficiencies of 50 90 using isolated fungi 51 zhou et al reported a removal efficiency of almost 100 by a oryzae 8 as well as by cunninghamella echinulate 49 and penicillium sp 52 using pleurotus ostreatus as much as 64 86 algal removal was achieved to produce an edible product 53 although the results of algal adsorption varied depending on many factors such as the strain used and physicochemical properties the additional removal of phosphorus with comparable removal using a niger f5 to harvest c vulgaris was remarkable thus using a niger f5 for dual purposes as a harvesting agent and additional phosphorus removal is recommended this is supported by the results of treatment iii after the cultivation period the results of wastewater treatments have shown improvement from the single strain treatment results biomass growth and nutrient removal among the treatments of c vulgaris and a niger combinations showed different removal traits and disparate growth nutrient removal efficiency and harvestability as the application of a niger at the stationary phase of c vulgaris phosphate removal occurred to be the most optimum for removal several key findings and prospective applications are as follows i application of the solubilizing activity as a primary mechanism of growth promoting activity of fungi to the algae shares a new perspective of co culture algae and fungi previously most co culture studies focused on the growth promoting signaling and growth hormones produced by the fungi to enhance algae growth 17 ii most of the fungi solubilizing phosphate created extreme acid conditions through organic acid secretion mechanisms 54 55 the acidic environments often lead to unfavorable conditions for algae to grow however the application of a niger did not show the extreme change in the wastewater medium that could be harmful to the alga this situation may have resulted from the low availability of degradable carbon sources available for the fungus thus the substrate with a limited carbon source for the fungi and proper nutrient concentration for the alga is essential to support the synergistic interaction between the organisms iii numerous previous studies emphasized the additional sugars on the wastewater to create filamentous pellets with high adsorption capacity 8 9 in this study the additional sugar for fungi would only be essential to form the pellets it is proven that the hyphae that formed during the co culture outside the pellets do not need any additional sugars to enhance the removal thus this advantageous trait of fungi can overcome the feasibility limitation of fungi as co culture of the alga iv the findings did not cover the actual wastewater content that may differ from sterilized wastewater however the positive effect of the co culture by adding fungi at the early stage of the stationary phase of phosphate removal indicates the promising result to be applied in the actual wastewater content the successful growth in sterilized wastewater can indicate the promising applicability of the system and the interaction between these organisms 56 v the combination of the c vulgaris with a niger can be adopted to the wastewater treatment with the excess phosphorus concentration thus this study s main contribution is the applicability of phosphate solubilizing organisms with microalgae to enhance phosphorus removal and increase the harvestability of the algae in other words this concept is also feasible to be applied in the system with fully established consortia 57 eventually this enhancement is also essential to elevate the affordability of biological removal of phosphorus by the algae in the wastewater compared with other established methods 58 overall coupling the algal harvesting process with the additional removal of phosphorus is demonstrated in the current study except for tn removal all parameters were enhanced by adding a niger f5 pellets in the stationary phase of c vulgaris phosphorus removal several vital points that need to be addressed further are highlighted based on the results i these findings show the benefits of algal based wastewater treatment for removing phosphorus this removal is often an obstacle as low removal efficiency is observed 46 however comparing the removal between the current results and well established consortia for phosphate removal the cultivation period becomes one of the significant issues a 10 days period of the removal was still lower than the combination of microalgae and suspended 59 or activated 60 sludges co culture for nutrient removals which only require less than a week here the acclimatization process for the alga may reduce the lag phase of the culture and eventually shorten the treatment period 61 ii the use of fungi for additional treatment did not affect the growth of algal cells even though the tn removal was slightly affected here ph adjustment and other operational parameters can be further explored to simultaneously improve all removal parameters including tn 62 iii the stability of the combination in unsterilized wastewater and its application in the continuous system is essential to be addressed further here application in the actual wastewater with a continuous system will be important for development at the pilot and actual scales 63 microbiome analysis for the system stability can also address the exact mechanisms of algae microbial interactions in the community 64 iv the formation of pellets using glucose is still not economically viable for industrial scale and thus affordable carbon sources for practical utilization can be further tested among the sources cassava wastewater from the starch extraction can be further tested for this purpose as it was previously reported to contain high degradable sugars contents 65 v the biomass generated can be analyzed to assess the chemical conversions of the process better this knowledge is important to decide how the biomass generated in such a system can be further utilized 66 additionally the economic value of generated compounds from the biomass can significantly reduce the total cost for this co culture application 4 conclusions aspergillus niger f5 was successfully isolated from cassava biogas effluent wastewater with promising phosphate solubilizing and pellet formation in a medium consisting of wastewater that was enriched with glucose the adsorption efficiency of the pellets generated from this strain was 73 81 depending on the glucose content employed during fungal pellet formation however only pellets formed in a 15 g l 1 glucose medium could hold the algae as they may contain eps to aid in attachment of the algal cells fungal pellets of a niger f5 were demonstrated to have dual advantages for algal harvest and additional nutrient removal in cassava biogas effluent wastewater addition of fungal pellets in the c vulgaris tistr 8580 culture increased the removal efficiencies of tp from 62 to 78 and cod from 39 to 51 nevertheless tn removal was lower with pellet addition than in the algal monoculture other algal cells also exhibited 70 adsorption efficiency at the end of a ten day cultivation or three days after pellet addition conversely formation of algal pellets at the beginning of the process did not show any adsorption this finding may help the development of applications for fungal based harvesting processes for algae with additional removal of nutrients nevertheless microbiome analysis bench test of actual wastewater usage with a continuous system and biomass content analysis will be critical in the future before this co culture application into the industrial scale credit authorship contribution statement m p n b n t and p p

13084,in recent years with the global increase in industrialization there has been a significant increase in the amount of toxic pollutants such as heavy metals being released into water bodies adsorption is considered as one of the most attractive methods due to its high efficiency and ability to remove heavy metals even at low concentration agricultural wastes based biosorbents have attracted great interest due to their capability to effectively remove heavy metals from wastewater chemical modifications on biosorbents can significantly improve the biosorption capacities and the longevity of the biosorbents most of the adsorption studies followed the langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherm models the pseudo second order kinetic model best fitted most of the adsorption kinetic studies moreover ion exchange electrostatic attraction and chelation were the governing adsorption mechanisms in most of the studies the adsorption process was usually spontaneous and endothermic in nature the regeneration of biosorbents was most effective when acids were used as eluents and this had allowed some biosorbents to be reused efficiently up to 10 times to elucidate a practical perspective analysis on column studies adsorption performance using industrial wastewater and cost analysis had been conducted cost analysis proved that agricultural wastes based biosorbents are cheaper than traditional adsorbents such as activated carbon graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption cost analysis kinetics and isotherms regeneration wastewater treatment 1 introduction over the last few decades there has been a dire need to solve the problem of heavy metal pollution in water heavy metals are extremely toxic metallic elements that end up in the environment due to anthropogenic activities industries such as mining metal processing fertilizer industry tanneries etc are some of the major sources of heavy metal contamination 1 heavy metals can be present in the environment in dissolved or particulate phase the dissolved form is known to be more hazardous 2 heavy metal pollution adversely affects the health of humans animals soil and aquatic life 3 they can easily disrupt the food chain due to their ability to accumulate in living cells and organs 4 properties of heavy metals such as their non biodegradability mobility and persistence make these elements very harmful 5 6 the atomic structure and the electron shells of these elements attribute to their highly reactive nature and ability to perform physiochemical and biochemical activities and thus may result in deleterious effects on the environment 4 industrial wastewater consists of various types of contaminants which is why various pre treatment steps are performed before the heavy metals can be targeted for removal 6 generally heavy metal removal technology falls into the tertiary treatment category 7 over the years various chemical biological and physical technologies have emerged as a result of the need to eliminate pollutants from wastewater 8 some examples of these technologies are ion exchange nanofiltration ozonation floatation membrane technology coagulation chemical precipitation and nanotechnology 4 9 13 however these technologies have certain disadvantages such as low removal efficiency secondary sludge production disposal issues and expensive operational costs 4 14 15 adsorption is a powerful technology that has gained a lot of attention over the other technologies for heavy metal removal 6 16 17 this process has several advantages such as the ability to treat heavy metals that are present in low concentration 1 100 mg l low operational costs and regeneration ability 8 18 various types of adsorbent materials including natural biological and waste based adsorbents have been evaluated for heavy metal removal of which activated carbon is widely used commercially 19 activated carbon is very efficient in removing heavy metals but is generally very expensive due to its production cost which includes an energy consuming and high temperature carbonization process 20 owing to this drawback researchers over the last few decades have been paying more attention to cost effective and efficient adsorbents that can be produced from inexpensive biomass agricultural wastes are a category of biomass that are abundantly available in the environment and have the ability to efficiently adsorb heavy metals on their surface effectively 1 14 21 25 the surface characteristics of these biosorbents such as availability of metal binding functional groups and a highly porous area aid in entrapping heavy metal ions within their pores 19 however these agricultural based biosorbents are required to undergo chemical modification to improve the adsorption capacity structural stability and reusability biosorbent modification can typically be divided into physical and chemical modifications physical modification involves breaking down of adsorbents to desired sizes and gasification at high temperature with gases such as carbon dioxide 26 27 a common physical modification method involves surface activation by using nitrogen gas to produce activated carbon from the biosorbent 28 on the other hand while performing chemical modification on a biosorbent acids such as hydrochloric acid 29 and nitric acid 29 alkalis such as sodium hydroxide 30 and potassium hydroxide 31 salts such as calcium chloride 32 and potassium chloride 33 as well as other substances such as iron oxide zinc oxide copper oxide methanol etc are commonly used as modifying agents 34 35 the aim of this review article is to systematically review the application of chemically modified agricultural wastes for the removal of heavy metals from water and wastewater this review article provides the recent advances in the field by comprehensively covering the adsorption performances of these biosorbents along with their underlying adsorption mechanisms and critical analysis of the effect of several important experimental parameters governing the adsorption process the article also elucidates the practical aspects such as column studies cost analysis performance of biosorbents using real industrial wastewater and desorption studies of various agricultural wastes which are often neglected in biosorption studies the inclusion of these topics is to allow the readers to have a better understanding on what is preventing biosorbents to replace existing commercial adsorbents such as ion exchange resin and activated carbon in addition recommendations have been provided to enable lab scale biosorption to be eventually applied at industrial scale 2 heavy metals and their harmful effects on human health heavy metals generally refer to metal and metalloids that have an atomic density greater than 4 g cm3 which is 5 times greater than water 36 38 some common heavy metals are arsenic chromium cadmium lead copper zinc nickel iron and barium the toxic behaviour of heavy metals is exacerbated due to its inability to naturally degrade over time the accumulation of these heavy metals in plants soil and aquatic life is a pathway to infiltrate the food chain heavy metal accumulation in the human body can cause serious health issues such as cancer impaired growth and reproduction neurological damage permanent brain damage encephalopathy and chronic damage to the nervous system 39 heavy metals are very harmful even at trace amounts therefore it is a necessity to develop efficient methods for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater the most commonly found heavy metals in the environment due to industrial pollution are provided in table 1 2 1 conventional methods for removal of heavy metals over the years numerous technologies have been implemented for the removal of heavy metals membrane filtration chemical precipitation ion exchange coagulation flocculation adsorption and electrodialysis are some examples of the technologies however most of these techniques have limitations that make them inefficient 46 2 1 1 membrane filtration membrane filtration is a popular method used in industries to treat pollutants in wastewater it can treat organic compounds suspended solids and inorganic compounds such as heavy metals there are various types of membranes such as ultrafiltration membranes microfiltration membranes nanofiltration membranes and reverse osmosis membranes the type of membrane is chosen on the basis of the size of the pollutant 41 although membrane filtration is effective it has limitations such as high initial cost high maintenance cost membrane fouling and limited lifespan 46 2 1 2 ion exchange in this technique an ion exchanger such as resins are used to remove the desired ions by an exchange mechanism the ion exchange material is able to replace its cation with the heavy metal ion in the polluted stream two examples of commonly used ion exchange resins are strongly acidic resins with sulfonic acid groups so3h and weakly acid resins with carboxylic acid groups cooh 47 although ion exchangers are efficient in removing heavy metals their capital and operation cost are high 48 2 1 3 electrodialysis this process involves the use of a semi permeable ion exchange membrane through which the heavy metal polluted water is passed by applying an electric potential the membrane sheets are either cationic or anionic in nature in a positively or negatively charged ionic membrane the anions are directed towards the anode and the cations are directed towards the cathode 49 2 1 4 chemical precipitation in this method the heavy metals ions react with a chemical to form insoluble precipitates like hydroxides and sulphide precipitates this can then be removed by sedimentation or filtration techniques 47 the operation of this process is simple but there is a large amount of sludge generation and this can increase the maintenance cost tremendously 46 2 1 5 coagulation and flocculation coagulation and flocculation is a ph dependent process which involves the addition of coagulants such as ferric alum salts the process destabilises the particle to cause sedimentation after that the size of the unstable particle is increased by flocculating the particles into floccules the drawbacks of this process include production of toxic sludge heavy use of chemicals and high operational costs 46 47 2 1 6 adsorption adsorption is defined as a process in which ions and molecules are bonded onto a solid material 10 50 52 adsorbent surfaces are mostly heterogeneous the adsorption sites are occupied from the highest energy sites to the lowest energy sites 53 the adsorption process creates a layer of adsorbate on the surface 54 adsorption process mainly occurs in three steps firstly the heavy metal from the bulk solution transfers to the adsorbents surface secondly the adsorption of the heavy metal on the surface occurs and lastly the heavy metals transport within the adsorbent 41 some of the factors that contribute to the adsorption efficiency are pore volume surface area polarity number of active sites and functional groups 55 adsorption is one of the most commonly technology used for pollutant clean up in wastewater 47 52 it is a very efficient process that is able to eliminate heavy metals present at low concentrations produce less sludge and maintain low operational cost 15 56 57 various types of adsorbent materials have been used for the removal of heavy metals they can be classified into inorganic bio based carbon based and polymeric adsorbents 58 some examples of commercially available adsorbents on the market are activated carbon silica gel and alumina 59 examples of different types of adsorbents are presented in table 2 typically an adsorbent material should be low cost have good structural and mechanical stability have high adsorption efficiency have a large surface area and have good regeneration capability the most commonly used adsorbent material is activated carbon this is because it has outstanding properties such as large surface area and excellent adsorption ability although it is very efficient for heavy metal removal it is very costly for instance regeneration process alone of spent activated carbon comprises of 75 of its operating cost in a fixed bed gas operator 60 another issue with these adsorbent materials is the lack of satisfactory disposal systems 3 biosorption 3 1 biosorption and its principals biosorption is a physio chemical process in which a biological material is used for the removal of selected substances from an aqueous solution 61 due to the growing demand of finding environmentally friendly approaches towards pollutant removal more attention is being drawn towards green chemistry or sustainable chemistry biosorption is a process that complies with these guidelines some of the principles of green chemistry are as follows 62 1 replace toxic chemical reagents 2 utilize safer reagents 3 avoid the generation secondary wastes that cannot be recycled 4 reuse reagents 5 reduce energy consumption 6 use techniques that are ecofriendly to detect analytes 7 using automation and developments on a microscale level biosorption falls under the category of adsorption with the difference being that the adsorbent is made from a biological matrix the sorption process may include various mechanisms depending upon the type of sorbate the biosorbent being used and other environmental factors biosorption is a metabolically independent and physiochemical process which may involve mechanisms such as ion exchange chelation electrostatic interaction adsorption redox reactions precipitation and surface complexation the possible mechanisms of biosorption are depicted in fig 1 the biosorption process will continue until it reaches an equilibrium state 63 this process has several advantages such as using cost effective and sustainable materials the process being metabolically independent effectively usage of waste materials and high removal efficiency even at low heavy metal concentrations 64 biosorbents can be classified as green adsorbents 21 they can be categorized into algae microbial and agricultural wastes based biosorbents one of the major advantages of using dead biomass such as agricultural wastes as opposed to living biomass is that they do not require a growth media and nutrients for their maintenance which will reduce the overall operational cost the process will also allow easier mathematical and statistical modelling of heavy metal uptake 55 63 65 the fabrication of green adsorbents in general requires lesser energy and can be recycled easily which reduces the overall waste production 46 3 1 1 steps involved in biosorption studies adsorption studies are generally conducted in the following steps 1 first the biosorbent undergoes pre treatment this may include sieving milling and washing 2 then the biosorbent is physically or and chemically modified to improve the availability of functional groups and active sites on the biosorbent for maximum biosorption to take place 3 the biosorbent is then characterized by using techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray diffraction xrd transmission electron microscopy tem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis various experimental factors that affect biosorption include ph temperature adsorbent dose metal concentration contact time and presence of competing ions these factors are varied to find the optimum conditions for biosorption after that the amount of heavy metal adsorbed is measured through analytical techniques such as atomic absorption spectrometry aas and inductively coupled plasma analysis icp 4 adsorption kinetic and adsorption isotherm studies are conducted to determine the adsorption rates adsorption equilibrium and maximum adsorption capacity 5 next desorption is conducted to recover the heavy metals from the wastewater and for the regeneration of the biosorbent material for further study and use 3 2 mechanisms involved in the removal of heavy metals by agricultural wastes in heavy metal removal agricultural wastes are typically available in large quantities and can easily be transformed into efficient heavy metal adsorbents 20 these wastes mainly consist of various types of inorganic and organic matter such as hemicellulose cellulose lignin protein carbohydrates pectin etc in their cell wall 66 the biosorption process of heavy metal on agricultural wastes mostly is due to functional groups such as carboxyl amine and hydroxyl groups 23 agricultural wastes also contain different types of minerals and carbon content that are responsible to drive physical forces such as van der waals forces dipole dipole interaction hydrophobicity steric interaction and hydrogen bonding 67 in order to understand the mechanism of heavy metal adsorption in biosorbents the functional groups present on the biosorbent surface must be analysed 50 the interactions between metal ions and functional groups need to be studied for a better understanding of the biosorption process agricultural wastes generally consist of various functional groups such hydroxyl group present in alcohol and carbohydrates carboxyl present in fatty acids protein and organic acids ester found in lipids keto group aldehyde and amine groups found in nuclei acids and proteins etc 11 68 these functional groups aid in binding metal cations and anions by forming coordinate complexes 23 the biosorbents generally have large surface area are very porous and consists of ligands these characteristics make agricultural based biosorbents desirable for adsorption 19 various mechanisms including complexation ion exchange chelation precipitation and physisorption can be involved in the metal ion uptake process 69 the biosorption process is greatly affected by factors such as ph adsorbent dose temperature metal ion concentration ionic strength reaction time and sorbent size therefore it is necessary to study the effects of these parameters on the biosorption capacity some of the commonly occurring biosorption mechanisms occurring during sorption of heavy metals on biosorbents are discussed below 3 2 1 ion exchange ion exchange is one of the most common mechanisms that takes place during the biosorption process this reversible exchange process involves the electrostatic interaction between positively charged metal ions in the solution with the negatively charged ions present on the surface of the biosorbent material typically there are various functional groups and free sites available on the surface of the biosorbent material for this exchange to take place in a study conducted by qu et al 70 the authors used sulphur functionalized rice husk for the removal of cadmium from water the authors reported that the main mechanisms involved were ion exchange and chelation upon conducting edx analysis for both modified and unmodified rice husks it was found that the na i ions increased from 4 33 mg g to 20 55 mg g and mg ii ions had increased from 0 02 mg g to 0 93 mg g after the biosorption process had reached equilibrium which means that ion exchange process would have taken place between the heavy metal ions and the positively charged magnesium and sodium ions in another study feng et al 32 studied the adsorption of copper lead and zinc by using modified orange peel they found that the mechanism of heavy metal uptake by the modified orange peel is based on the ion exchange mechanism between the copper lead zinc ions and the calcium chelated onto the carboxylic groups present in the structure of pectin similarly reddad et al 71 also reported that ion exchange mechanism and chelation were the main mechanisms that took place between pb2 cu2 and zn2 on sugar beet pulp with the calcium ions 3 2 2 complexation functional groups present in the biosorbent have the ability to form complex coordinate bonds with heavy metals ions a complex compound can be defined as a poly atomic molecule that has one or more central atoms surrounded by and attached to ligands 72 for example in a study conducted by harripersadth et al 73 the authors reported that complexation was the main mechanism for the removal of cadmium and lead ions using sugarcane bagasse and eggshells as a biosorbent material the authors explained through ftir analysis that the carboxyl groups present in eggshells form complexes with cadmium and lead ions for sugarcane bagasse ftir analysis confirmed the presence of hydroxyl carbonyl and aromatic rings these functional groups donate an electron pair to be able to form complexes with the metal ions 3 2 3 chelation when a ligand is attached to the central atom through two or more coordinating atoms then the complex is called chelate 72 74 and the chelate formation process is known as chelation biosorbents generally contain ligands that assist the chelation process for example he et al 75 used a lignin based biosorbent derived from corn for the removal and recovery of au iii from aqueous solution the authors reported that the adsorption process took place because au iii ions chelated onto the biosorbent through the nitrogen containing functional groups from polyaniline and oxygen containing functional groups from lignin which was enzymatically hydrolysed following this after a redox reaction between the functional groups and the au iii ions au iii was converted into au 0 3 2 4 micro precipitation in this process an insoluble metal particulate is formed it is another common process that may occur during the adsorption of heavy metals during micro precipitation precipitation takes place on the surface of the biosorbent or within the pores of the adsorbent for example liu et al 76 used water melon rind as a biosorbent to adsorb copper zinc and lead from aqueous solution the mechanisms involved in the adsorption were ion exchange and micro precipitation the sem micrographs and analysis in the study revealed that upon interaction between the biosorbent and the heavy metal the pores on the surface became less as they were occupied by the metal ions the active surface area also increased and was covered by the metal ions that had precipitated panda et al 77 also reported micro precipitation as a mechanism through which cadmium ions were adsorbed on the lathyrus sativus husk 4 adsorption studies 4 1 adsorption isotherms to gain a better understanding on the mechanism of adsorption between the adsorbate and adsorbent various mathematical models known as adsorption isotherms are applied to the system the different types of adsorption isotherms include langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich sips halsey temkin redlich peterson etc 78 84 in table 3 various adsorption studies have been listed along with the best fitting adsorption isotherm model coefficient correlation r2 value experimental conditions such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t initial metal ion concentration co dosage d ph and the calculated maximum adsorption capacity qmax as seen in table 3 most of the studies fit in best with either the langmuir or freundlich isotherm models the conceptual basis of the langmuir isotherm model is that the biosorption takes place in a monolayer surrounding a homogenous solid surface in which there is no contact between the adsorbed species 85 the freundlich isotherm suggests the heterogeneity of the adsorbate 86 the mathematical equations for the langmuir isotherm is as follows 78 1 c e q e c e q m 1 q m k l linear 2 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e non linear in the above equation c e is the aqueous phase adsorbate equilibrium concentration mg l qm is the theoretical maximum monolayer coverage capacities mg g kl is langmuir isotherm constant l mg and qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g the freundlich isotherm model can be described with the following mathematical equation 79 3 log q e log k f log c e n linear equation 4 q e k f c e 1 n non linear equation in the above equation c e is the concentration of metal ions at equilibrium mg l qe is the mass of metal ions adsorbed at equilibrium mg g kf is the adsorption capacity constant mg g l mg 1 n n is a constant denoting the degree and favourability of adsorption for instance in a study conducted by edathil et al 87 the authors fitted the adsorption data into the langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin models to study the adsorption of lead ions on a magnetic coffee waste nanocomposite the langmuir isotherm best fitted the experimental data with an r2 value greater than 0 99 this indicates that a monolayer adsorption took place during the adsorption process the maximum adsorption capacity was 41 15 mg g at optimal experimental conditions 4 2 adsorption kinetics in an adsorption process adsorption kinetic studies are used to describe the mechanisms of reaction rate control such as progress of chemical reactions processes and mass transfer these models describe the rate of solute bonding on the surface of the biosorbent the most commonly used kinetic models are pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models these models assume that the rate of sorption is proportional to the number of free sites on the surface of the sorbent in the proper power first or second 50 in table 4 various adsorption studies using agricultural wastes have been listed along with the best fitting kinetic model coefficient correlation r2 value experimental conditions such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t initial metal ion concentration co dosage d ph and equilibrium adsorption capacities qe as seen in table 4 most of the adsorption studies fit best in the pseudo second order kinetic model this means that the adsorption mechanism is mainly dominated by chemisorption the mathematical equation for the pseudo second order kinetics is as follows 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e in this equation qe and qt is the adsorption capacities mg g at equilibrium and time t k2 is the rate constant for second order adsorption gmg 1 min 1 and is determined from the linear plot of t qt versus t for instance owalude and tella 113 studied the adsorption kinetics of hexavalent chromium on modified groundnut hull by studying the uptake of the hexavalent chromium ions at different time intervals and at optimal conditions the experimental data on the effect of contact time on the adsorption of hexavalent chromium ions was fitted in the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models the kinetics data fitted best into the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic model with r2 value of 0 9992 indicating that the governing adsorption mechanism was chemisorption involving valence forces through exchange and or sharing of electrons between the adsorbent and adsorbate 30 5 brief overview of chemical modifications of biosorbents for the removal of heavy metals 5 1 chemical modifications of agricultural wastes depending on the genetic makeup of agricultural wastes the adsorption capacity may not be high because of low mechanical strength or lack of preferential active sites for adsorption moreover in some cases raw biosorbents may contain substance that may block functional groups present on the surface and thereby hinder biosorption leading to reduced adsorption capacity 140 therefore over the years researchers have been developing ways to enhance adsorption capacity active sites for adsorption mechanical strength and longevity of biosorbents through various physical biological and chemical modifications 141 however chemical modification of biosorbents often takes precedence over other forms of treatment due to its simplicity and efficiency 142 chemical modifications can change the biosorbent behaviour in terms their ability to participate in ion exchange their hydrophobicity hydrophilicity the elasticity and thermal resistance 67 generally prior to performing chemical modifications the biosorbent undergoes various steps such as washing drying crushing grinding and sieving 95 127 143 a list of such modifications conducted on various agriculture waste based biosorbents are presented in table 5 after achieving the desired size various types of modifying agents as mentioned in fig 2 including acids bases and organic compounds are used for chemical pre treatment by treating the biosorbent surface with acids and bases the surface gets oxidized and forms functional groups that can overall enhance the sorption capacity 144 other methods such as biosorbent immobilization which include crosslinking of polymers are also used graft polymerization is another method in which long polymer chains such as acrylic acid acrylamide acrylonitrile hydroxylamine and glycidyl monomers are introduced on the biosorbent backbone to enhance biosorption 57 5 1 1 biosorbent composites in synthesizing a biosorbent composite generally two or more selected materials are combined together to create a composite with improved properties 149 biosorbents can also be combined with other organic compounds or metal oxides to achieve better biosorbent properties 144 some examples of composite materials that can be incorporated in biosorbents are nano3 polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl chloride dimethylamine metal salts such as iron salt copper salts zinc salts etc 150 152 among composite materials metal oxide salts have been of great interest to researchers and has been explored extensively this is because metal oxide salts can be used to produce magnetized particles which can then produce enhanced biosorbents with magnetic properties that can be separated and reused easily the combination with metal oxide salts can significantly enhance the biosorption capacity 153 154 magnetic biosorbents are generally prepared by treating the biosorbent material with metallic salts such as iron chloride hexahydrate iron sulphate heptahydrate manganese oxide tetrahydrate and manganese sulphate hydrate 155 when choosing a biosorbent for heavy metal removal the ability of the adsorbent to be separated from the adsorbate is one of the most crucial criteria otherwise there will be secondary pollution which will also increase the cost of the operation and maintenance magnetic biosorbents can be easily separated under the influence of an external magnetic field 24 in adsorption processes smaller sized magnetic materials have advantages due to their high surface area volume ratio magnetic nanoparticles fall under the particle size of 100 nm and are single domain particles exhibiting a superparamagnetic behaviour 156 in the absence of an external magnetic field these magnetic nanoparticles have zero magnetization no coercivity and are less likely to agglomerate 157 these consequences of the superparamagnetic behaviour make them favourable for adsorption processes the main mechanisms of sorption by magnetic biosorbents are ion exchange electrostatic interaction precipitation and complexation magnetic biosorbents can contribute towards ion exchange through their metal based functional groups 158 they can also contribute to redox reactions due to their surface charge 65 most of the biosorbents are diamagnetic in nature which is why they need to be modified by superparamagnetic ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic particles to become magnetically active superparamagnetic magnetic iron oxide particles that are commonly used are magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite fe2o3 polysaccharide biopolymers such as cellulosic material are commonly used for magnetic modification due to their ability to improve and tune the chemical affinity towards specific heavy metals in wastewater there are various methods to prepare magnetic biosorbents such as co precipitation reactions in microemulsions hydrothermal reactions sol gel syntheses reactions hydrolysis and thermolysis of precursors mechanochemical processes and microwave synthesis co precipitation is more commonly used to prepare magnetic biosorbents 159 160 5 2 studies on chemical modification of biosorbents in this section various agricultural waste based adsorbents have been discussed focusing on their chemical modification adsorption mechanisms and functional groups involved in the uptake of heavy metals factors affecting biosorption such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t initial metal ion concentration co dosage d and ph are also discussed the mechanisms and functional groups involved in various adsorbents is listed in table 6 whereas the data on modifying agents and the adsorbents performance is listed in table 7 5 2 1 chemical modification of biosorbents using metal and inorganic salts it has been reported that biosorption efficiency can be enhanced by using metal salts and inorganic salts moreover metal and inorganic salts do not cause a mass loss in the biosorbents like acids or bases do in a study conducted by guo et al 33 the authors modified orange peels with kcl to study the removal of cu2 cd2 pb2 zn2 and ni2 from aqueous solution orange peels constitutes of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin which form carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups that are efficient in heavy metal uptake 124 modification using kcl can be used to initiate an ion exchange reaction between h of carboxylic acid present on the orange peel surface and the na mg2 or k ions to increase ion exchange capability 123 in this study adsorption equilibrium was attained after 20 min the adsorption followed a pseudo second order kinetics indicating that the adsorption took place through chemisorption the study also included adsorption experiments in a single and binary metal system to study the effects of competing ions the results showed that adsorption was equally efficient in both the systems it has been reported that zncl2 can improve mesopores specific surface area and micropores of a biosorbent 59 158 pei and liu 118 modified grapefruit peel by using zncl2 as an activating agent for the removal of lead ions from aqueous solution upon investigation the authors concluded that the sorption occurred through chemisorption ion exchange between lead ions and biosorbent surface had taken place introduction of negatively charged cl groups could also participate in metal binding the biosorbent surface consists of oxygen rich functional groups which will interact with the lead ions and undergo chemical adsorption after that the lead ions will accumulate on the surface of the biosorbent by means of physical adsorption from these case studies it is evident that when a metal or organic salt is used for modifying a biosorbent it promotes an ion exchange reaction between the heavy metal and the modified biosorbent surface similarly in a study conducted by mohamed et al 169 the authors modified banana peel with koh for the removal of pb2 and fe2 ions the results demonstrated that the maximum removal efficiency reached 100 and 64 respectively it was reported that the addition of koh to the untreated banana peel hydrolysed the peel and promoted the formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups increasing the amount of koh created stronger and broader peaks when analysed therefore treating the samples with koh increased the oxygen containing functional groups the main adsorption mechanisms were expected to be ion exchange and surface complexation with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups 5 2 2 chemical modification of biosorbents using bases it has been reported that alkali treatment of biosorbents can increase the porosity of a biosorbent and incorporate new functional groups which can participate in biosorption through mechanisms such as ion exchange 144 calcium hydroxide is commonly used saponifying agent used to modify biosorbents to improve the uptake of heavy metals 128 it has been reported that calcium hydroxide causes a crosslinking reaction with the molecules of the biosorbent 187 in a study conducted by peng et al 124 orange peel modified with ca oh 2 was used to study the removal arsenic from aqueous solution in this study the surface morphology was analysed through sem analysis the sem images after chemical modification depicted a heterogeneous surface which was favourable for arsenic adsorption it was reported that as v exists mainly as h2aso4 between a ph range of 3 and 6 therefore in this study adsorption could have taken place due to the substitution of cooh oh groups with the ions of h2aso4 present on the surface of the biosorbent 188 furthermore the ftir spectra confirmed the presence of metal binding functional groups such as carboxylic groups and hydroxyl group nh oh band at 3427 93 cm 1 1649 61 cm 1 and 1033 23 cm 1 cn band at 1242 20 cm 1 co band at ch band at 2927 44 cm 1 that would participate in ionization and the removal of arsenic similarly muskmelon peel was modified with ca oh 2 and used as a biosorbent for the removal of pb2 by huang and zhu 116 muskmelon peel consists of protein cellulose and polysaccharides such as pectic acid these functional groups are associated with metal binding functional groups such as cooh and oh about 10 of the muskmelon peel consists of pectic acid dry weight pectic acid is also the source of functional ligands which can participate in the uptake of lead ions after modification with ca oh 2 the pectic acid will be converted to pectic calcium and participate in forming bonds with the positively charged lead ions cationic exchange between the ca2 and pb2 is the main biosorption mechanism in this study similar cation exchange mechanism was reported by feng and guo 32 when the authors used sodium hydroxide and calcium chloride to modify orange peel for the removal of cu2 pb2 and zn2 sem analysis conducted in this study revealed that after modification with sodium hydroxide and calcium chloride the biosorbent surface showed more irregularities and pores the surface area was analysed by bet method and the results showed that modified orange peel had a surface area of 1 496 m2 g and the unmodified orange peel had a surface area of 0 828 m2 g denoting that the surface area had increased after chemical modification increase in surface area means that there will be more active sites available for heavy metal adsorption the metal uptake process reached equilibrium very quickly within 10 min the adsorption capacity increased after modification from 44 28 mg g to 70 73 mg g for cu2 113 5 mg g to 208 9 mg g for pb2 and 21 25 mg g to 56 18 mg g for zn2 the modified adsorbent also showed high selectivity towards pb2 and zn2 the adsorption capacities metals adsorbed per gram of biosorbent as achieved by the biosorbents were analysed in terms of the ca2 ions remaining inside the aqueous solution it was evident that ion exchange process took place between the cationic metal ions and ca2 the mechanism of adsorption can be described as ion exchange between the heavy metal ions and calcium ions chelated to the carboxylic groups on the polymeric structure of pectin in the adsorbent additionally modifying a biosorbent with a base can increase the negative charge on the surface of the biosorbent and increase the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged biosorbent surface and the cationic heavy metals ions similarly ayob et al 179 also modified pineapple waste using naoh for the removal of lead form aqueous solution the adsorption efficiency increased from 52 57 to 85 88 after modification this was because after treating the pineapple waste with naoh the adsorbent is expected to undergo deprotonation the na ions in the naoh are more electropositive than pb2 which allows a displacement reaction between the sodium and lead ions additionally ion exchange between the lead ions and the carboxylate and hydroxyl anionic groups present on the adsorbent surface can occur 5 2 3 chemical modification of biosorbents with acids modification of biosorbents with acids helps to remove impurities and unwanted compounds from the biosorbents surface there have been various studies in which the biosorption efficiency was improved by using acids as modifying agents according to horsfall et al 189 mercaptoacetic acid causes thiolation incorporation of sulfhydryl groups of the oh functional groups that are abundantly available on cellulose backbone there have been various studies in which researchers have modified agricultural wastes using mercaptoacetic acid in a study conducted by liang et al 91 the authors used orange peels modified with mercaptoacetic acid for the removal of pb2 and zn2 from aqueous solution ftir analysis confirmed that hydroxyl carboxyl and mercapto groups were responsible for the adsorption the modified orange peel can adsorb heavy metal ions through cation exchange complexation or even through a combination of both the processes in the reaction mechanism functional groups such as oh sh and cooh will release h ions into the aqueous solution and the heavy metal ions will be adsorbed on the active sites of the biosorbent the authors noticed a significant improvement from 90 mg g to 164 mg g for pb2 and 25 to 80 mg g for zn2 after modification with mercaptoacetic acid ion exchange is a predominant biosorption mechanism that takes place between heavy metal ions and functional groups for example lasheen et al 89 used acid treatment to modify orange peel by protonation with hno3 to study the removal of cd2 cu2 and pb2 from aqueous solution soaking the orange peel in hno3 followed by rinsing and drying unnecessary components that would block the active sites thereby exposing them for adsorption to take place protonation of the biosorbent also reduces the competition between ions such as ca2 and k so that metal ions can bind the available active sites the ftir spectra analysis revealed a change in bonding pattern of the carboxylate group present in pectin which indicates its involvement in the biosorption process similar results were observed by fu and wang 15 suyono et al 96 also used hno3 to modify petai peels and papaya leaves for the removal of pb2 ions from aqueous solution ftir analysis revealed that the dominant functional groups participating in adsorption present on petai peels and papaya leaves were the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups nitric acid also has the ability to increase the acidic groups on the surface of the biosorbent by reacting with the functional groups that are basic in nature to produce more acidic functional groups through heterocyclic opening 190 petai peel followed langmuir isotherm indicating a homogenous monolayer adsorption whereas papaya peels followed freundlich isotherm indicating multilayer adsorption before adsorption sem analysis showed a porous biosorbent surface after adsorption took place these pores were smaller which indicates the accumulation of the heavy metals ions in the pores in another study conducted by burevska et al 100 hno3 was used to modify peanut husks for the removal of ni2 ions sem analysis of the peanut husk before chemical modification depicted a rough surface with numerous pores and cavities after chemical modification new cavities and pores were spotted this improved the structure of the biosorbent and contributed to the increase in the specific surface area and increased the biosorption capacity the adsorption isotherm studies revealed that peanut husks modified with hno3 showed better adsorption capacity when compared to natural peanut husk as reported by nguyen et al 191 oxygen and nitrogen content increases with nitric acid treatment whereas carbon content reduces this could be due to 1 more number oxygen containing functional groups involving phenolic carboxylic and nitro moieties on the surface and 2 due to more number of no3 and no2 groups resulting from nitric acid therefore oxidation via nitric acid could increase the biosorption ability of a biosorbent in various studies biosorbents modified by citric acid have produced carboxylic acid sites that have contributed to increasing the adsorption capacity 192 citric acid modification has been reported to increase cationic exchange properties of the biosorbent 193 in a study conducted by liu et al 102 the authors modified sugarcane bagasse with citric acid and fe3o4 for the removal of cd2 and pb2 from aqueous solution citric acid is known to be a chelator that can combine itself with heavy metal ions such as cd cu and pb to limit their mobilization also esterification between hydroxyl groups and citric acid can produce more functional groups and active sites on the surface of the biosorbent the sugarcane bagasse showed higher removal capacity after chemical modification the biosorption was found to be mainly due to the oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups ftir analysis indicated the occurrence of complexation with the carbonyl groups it also revealed that a number of carboxylic groups also participated in the adsorption by sharing oxygen electrons with the cd2 and pb2 ions similar analysis has been reported by vaughan et al 192 it was reported that in an esterification reaction when a citric acid molecule is attached to the cellulose of a corncob each citric acid molecule attached produced an additional two carboxylic acid groups for biosorption and thereby increased the adsorption capacity it was reported by özer et al 194 that chemical treatment with acids such as h2so4 can convert macropores into micropores this can cause a change in the surface area h2so4 also removed potassium and chlorine from the surface of the biosorbent after removing these groups carbon oxygen and sulphur groups were left on the surface these groups are expected to engage in biosorption similarly martín lara et al 105 also used h2so4 to modify sugarcane bagasse for the removal of lead ions from aqueous solution chemical modification with h2so4 produced more negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylic acid the treatment is also expected to cause an increase in the surface area and oxidize the functional groups present on the biosorbent to carboxylic groups which will enhance biosorption carboxylic acid is expected to increase the biosorption of lead ions amine groups were also found at a ph of 10 and could have contributed towards the biosorption the adsorption capacity before and after biosorption increased from 6 366 mg g to 7 297 mg g in a study conducted by ahmad et al 195 pineapple fruit peel was modified by oxidizing it with h2so4 and kmno4 to study the removal of cd2 and pb2 from aqueous solution the authors reported that the chemical modification greatly enhanced the biosorption capacity the biosorption capacity for both the metal ions was higher for the modified pineapple peel it was hypothesized that biosorption may have taken place through chelation electrostatic attraction between the anionic ligands i e coo oh and the metal ions while the carboxyl hydroxyl groups undergoes deprotonation at a ph range of 3 4 moreover adsorption isotherm studies revealed that the data fit best with the langmuir isotherm which implies that the process was a homogenous and monolayer adsorption the biosorption of cd2 was seen to be significantly higher than pb2 this was attributed to pb2 having a larger atomic radii of 1 20 å in comparison to cd2 that has an atomic radii of 0 97 å which causes steric hindrance in another study conducted by hemavathy et al 170 the authors modified cassia fistula seeds with hcl and h2so4 to remove lead ions from aqueous solution cassia fistula seeds modified with h2so4 showed the highest adsorption capacity it was reported that the presence of alcohol sulphates and phosphates on the surface of the adsorbent could promote hydrogen bonding with the lead ions the lead ions were adsorbed through hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces between the lead ions and the adsorbent surface 5 2 4 chemical modification of biosorbents by graft polymerization another method of chemical modification is graft polymerization in this process a side chains made up of monomers are covalently bonded and polymerized on the cellulosic backbone forming a copolymer this process can improve the metal binding capacity of a biosorbent for example in a study conducted by ali et al 85 it was reported that by grafting acrylonitrile side chain onto the cellulosic skeleton of banana peels there was a significant improvement in the uptake of cr vi from ions from aqueous solution due to the enhancement in the metal biosorbent interaction sem analysis revealed that the unmodified banana peels had lignin pectin and other viscous components the modified banana peel depicted that the viscous components were removed thereby revealing more pores and an uneven surface after adsorption the surface looked smoother due to the filling up of pores with heavy metals the adsorption followed the langmuir isotherm model which indicates that the uptake process is a monolayer adsorption thermodynamic studies revealed that the process is exothermic feasible and spontaneous similarly in another study conducted by feng et al 88 the authors chemically modified orange peel by hydrolysing the grafted copolymer which was synthesised by interacting methyl acrylate with cross linking orange peel to remove pb2 cd2 ni2 ions from aqueous solution the maximum adsorption capacities by modified orange peel for pb2 cd2 and ni2 ions were 476 1 293 3 and 162 6 mg g when compared to the unmodified orange peels the adsorption capacities were 4 2 4 6 and 16 5 fold for pb2 cd2 and ni2 respectively an equilibrium was reached within 150 min at 30 c ftir spectrum of the biosorbent depicted that carboxyl and hydroxyl groups were present in abundance and would have assisted in adsorption of the metal ions onto the biosorbent surface overall the adsorption capacity increased significantly by grafting methyl acrylate on orange peel this can be attributed to the introduction of additional carboxyl groups on the adsorbent surface 5 2 5 comparative studies of chemically modified biosorbents using various modifying agents the effect of chemical modification on the sorption efficiency depends on many factors such as the type of modifying agent nature of the biosorbent material itself and the type of the ions being adsorbed 196 197 therefore the outcome of chemical modification will be different for each type of biosorbent in a study conducted by villen guzman et al 94 various modifying agents such as hno3 hcl h3po4 cacl2 nh3 and naoh were used to modify lemon peel for the removal of ni2 from aqueous solution the effect of each modifying agent was studied surface treatment with naoh showed the best results it has been previously reported that chemical modification using alkaline treatments such as naoh treatment increases the number of carboxylate ligands for the metal binding sites allowing enhanced adsorption 198 villen guzman et al 94 reported that the biosorption of nickel ions reached 100 with an adsorbent dose of 5 g l the pectin cellulose and pigments present in lemon peel consists of various functional groups such as carboxyl group hydroxyl group and alkyl groups ftir analysis confirmed that after nickel ions were adsorbed on the lemon peel there was a reduction in the peak intensities of the co and co due to the adsorption moreover the peak intensities associated with alkyl groups were reduced indicating the involvement of these groups in the biosorption process these functional groups promote metal binding as depicted in fig 3 sem micrographs showed that after modification with naoh even though there was some alteration in the surface structure the superficial structure was maintained the change in surface irregularities could have contributed to the improved adsorption of nickel ions it was explained that the increase in adsorption capacity of the naoh treated adsorbent was due to the conversion of the lignin structure into a negatively charged surface which will strongly attract positively charged heavy metal ions naoh modification may have also caused the metal hydroxides to micro precipitate thereby increasing adsorption in another study conducted by mahmood ul hassan et al 199 the authors reported that chemical modification of banana stalks corn cob and sunflower achene with naoh gave the best adsorption results when compared to modifications using nitric acid and sulfuric acid for the removal of cd2 cr2 and pb2 the chemical treatment is expected to have facilated the hydrolysis of the hemicellulose with the acid alkali chen et al 200 explained that during hydrolysis monomeric sugars and soluble oligomers are released from the cell wall matrix into the hydrolysate thereby increasing the porosity and the heavy metal sorption capacity low et al 201 and mahmood ul hassan et al 199 also explained that treatment with naoh increases the galacturonic acid groups after hydrolysis of o methyl ester groups and increases metal sorption in another study conducted by massocatto et al 30 naoh modified banana peel showed better adsorption results when compared with hcl and h3po4 for the removal of pb2 from aqueous solution the naoh modified banana peel had the maximum biosorption capacity of 90 mg g and followed the freundlich adsorption isotherm it was also proved through desorption studies that the naoh modified banana peel most efficiently desorbed the lead ions with hcl as the desorbing agent ftir analysis confirmed the presence of hydroxyl carbonyl phosphate and carboxyl groups present on the biomass it also showed the difference in morphological structure before and after modification according to the peak intensities banana peel modified with hcl gave the most drasticcalteration and suggested the presence of carboxyl anions morphological studies revealed that h3po4 did not alter the surface significantly but there was a notable alteration in the structure of banana peels modified with naoh and hcl the surface showed irregularities in the form of lamellar pore channel which may be attributed to the hydrolysis reaction of carbohydrates and fibers banana peel modified with naoh also portrayed a rougher surface which is favourable for adsorption shuhaimen et al 145 studied removal of copper ions from aqueous solution by papaya peels modified with naoh and concluded that the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the papaya peel were involved in the adsorption of copper ions there were studies in which acid treatment showed better results when compared to other base treatments for example in a study performed by santos et al 104 the authors investigated the effect of chemical modification on sugarcane bagasse by citric acid naoh and citric acid with naoh treatment on the removal of lead ions from aqueous solution chemical modification by citric acid showed the best results ftir analysis conducted after chemical modification indicated that carboxylic acid groups were present at a stretching vibration of 1730 cm 1 in another investigation conducted by nuithitikul et al 112 the authors modified cashew nutshell with h2so4 hno3 and naoh to remove pb2 from aqueous solution the authors noticed that the surface area increased significantly after modification with h2so4 the surface area after modification was 0 648 m2 g the pore volume and mean pore diameter also increased after modification modification with h2so4 also showed the best adsorption capacity of 8 30 mg g whereas untreated cashew nutshell showed the lowest adsorption capacity of 2 08 mg g it was reported by esteghlalian et al 202 that pre treating biosorbents with dilute h2so4 can lead to high reaction rates and enhanced cellulosic hydrolysis treatment with h2so4 causes an increase in single o2 bond containing functional groups such as alcohols phenols esters etc this was confirmed through ftir analysis sharp peaks at 1028 1155 and 1207 cm 1 the significant increase in efficiency could be attributed to the co and co bonds formed after modification in this study cashew nutshell modified with hno3 showed the next highest adsorption capacity when compared to naoh modified cashew nutshell hno3 modified cashew nutshell had increased number of actives sites present on the biosorbent surface according to the results of ftir analysis also the pore volume and specific surface area were found to be greater than naoh treated cashew shell 5 2 6 chemical modification of biosorbents using magnetic particles magnetic particles and nanoparticles have proven to increase the sorption efficiency of biosorbents moreover due to their magnetic properties they can be easily separated after biosorption has taken place peanut hull is an agricultural waste produced from the shelling process of graded peanuts it was estimated that about 500 000 tonnes of peanut hull biomass are readily available annually due to its abundance and high organic matter it is a good candidate to be transformed into a biosorbent for heavy metals adsorption it has been reported that the peanut body typically consists of proteins polysaccharides and lipids they consist of various metal binding functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amine groups that participate in heavy metal binding 127 203 however to increase the adsorption efficiency and physical characteristics of peanut hull based biosorbents researchers have applied various types of chemical modifications techniques in order to improve the adsorption capacity of biosorbents for example in a study conducted by kucukcongar et al 127 the authors produced a nanocomposite with peanut hull iron ii sulphate and iron iii chloride via co precipitation method to study the removal of ni2 ions ftir analysis confirmed the presence of hydroxyl group on the surface of modified ph fe3o4 at 3324 71 cm 1 and unmodified peanut hull ph at 3303 05 cm 1 however after the biosorption of nickel ions took place the peak of the hydroxyl groups was not present anymore indicating that this group may have been involved in the binding of heavy metals moreover changes in the oh ch co and feo peaks during the analysis proved their participation in the sorption process additionally sem analysis of ph fe3o4 showed the presence of lignin protein cellulose long thin fibers and active zones after adsorption of nickel onto the nanocomposite the number of occupied pores and particles increased when compared to unmodified peanut hull due to the adsorption of nickel ions and presence of iron oxide particles based on the sem edx analysis performed on the ph fe3o4 nanocomposite for elemental analysis it was concluded that the nanocomposite consisted of a high percentage of iron carbon and oxygen the presence of iron oxide was also confirmed through sem edx the percentage of iron oxide increased from 0 21 in peanut hull to 15 94 in ph fe3o4 indicating the effect of ph modification the surface area of the nanocomposite material was analysed through bet method the surface area was found to be 37 44 m2 g in this study the native peanut hull originally consisted of metal binding functional groups further modification of the peanut hull by incorporating magnetic nanoparticles increased the surface area added more actives sites and functional groups to the biosorbent thereby improving the adsorption efficiency similarly lichi peels lp are an abundantly available agricultural waste with great heavy metal biosorption potential due to the presence of functional groups such as amino groups carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups litchi peels have the ability to adsorb heavy metals these functional groups cause the surface of litchi peels to be negatively charged thereby promoting heavy metal uptake it was reported by jiang et al 204 that magnetically modifying lp with fe3o4 nanoparticles mlp enhanced the removal of pb ii from aqueous solution the functional groups of both lp and mlp were analysed through ft ir spectra the adsorption peaks confirmed the presence of hydroxyl amino and carbonyl groups notably the introduction of fe3o4 nanoparticles onto the litchi peels did not alter the active groups present on the biosorbent surface the magnetic litchi peels were of superparamagnetic nature according to the saturation magnetization curve which also confirms the magnetization of the litchi peels isotherm studies resulted in a high correlation coefficient value for both freundlich and langmuir model the adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo second order model with a correlation factor of 0 9999 which indicates that the adsorption took place mainly through chemisorption as depicted in fig 4 separation studies showed that sedimentation after adsorption in the presence of magnetic field occured rapidly thus it can be concluded that the presence of a magnetic field can provide quick and efficient solid liquid separation pengsaket et al 161 investigated the removal of cu2 by using magnetically modified pomelo peel with fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles mnps pp co precipitation method was used to synthesis the mnps pp nanocomposite material by varying different ratios by weight 2 1 2 2 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 the sorption results showed that as the amount of pomelo peel increased in the composite material the sorption of cu2 also increased it was concluded that the mnps pp showed higher adsorption capacity when compared to magnetic nanoparticles by itself among the magnetically modified pomelo peel ratios mnps pp 2 6 achieved maximum adsorption of 8 mg g the adsorption equilibrium was reached at the 20 40 min mark the inner pomelo peel contains polysaccharide that consist of many hydroxyl groups it can be derived that the adsorption process occurred due to the ion exchange between the h present in the hydroxyl group and cu2 ions 5 mfeoh cu2 feo mcu 2 m mh morphological studies of the mnps pp nanocomposite revealed that the adsorption mechanism of cu2 occurred through ion exchange due to the presence of oh functional group on the surface of the biosorbent separation studies were conducted by using an external magnetic field which resulted in easy and quick settling of the cu2 embedded in the mnp pp lópez téllez et al 101 synthesised iron oxide nanorods in orange peels to study the reduction of chromium vi from aqueous solution constituents of orange peel such as cellulose hemicellulose and lignin components are naturally occurring reducing agents these components aid in the formation of iron and or iron oxide nanorods from iron ions the biosorbent had a maximum adsorption capacity of 7 44 mg g which is much higher when compared to adsorption via unmodified orange peel that achieved an adsorption capacity of 1 9 mg g the adsorption mechanism suggested by the authors is a redox reaction between hydroxyl groups and iron ions langmuir isotherm model was found to be the best fit adsorption isotherm this means the adsorption was homogenous and underwent a monolayer formation costa et al 143 investigated the sorption performance of magnetized coconut fiber for the removal of cr vi from aqueous solution at a ph of 2 and all other experimental factors at optimal conditions the sorption capacity of the magnetized coconut fiber and natural coconut fiber was 87 38 mg g and 23 87 mg g respectively the process attained equilibrium within 20 min the magnetized coconut fibers showed a 4 times higher sorption capacity than natural fibers the ph at the point of zero charge was 3 19 for the natural fiber and 3 53 for the magnetized fiber moreover sem analysis revealed that the natural fiber was a porous material with plenty of pores and tubes on the surface of the biosorbent whereas in the case of the magnetized coconut fiber smaller pore diameter was seen there was a decrease in surface porosity as pores were replaced by iron nanoparticles which acted as active sites for sorption the sem images also showed aggregates along the fiber which aided in the increase of the adsorption capacity there was also a decrease in the amorphous nature of the biosorbent after the introduction of crystalline magnetite onto its surface similarly haghighat and ameri 35 also used iron nanoparticles to modify wheat straw ws to synthesise a nano magnetic wheat straw mws biosorbent for the sorption of lead native wheat straw consists of many hydroxyl groups that be chemical reaction sites these sites are where fe3o4 iron particles can be adsorbed and form fe3o4 crystals the ftir spectra confirmed the presence of bonded hydroxyl group at broad peaks at 3346 28 cm 1 in the native wheat straw other peaks on the spectra depicted the carbonyl group stretching from aldehydes and ketones at 1733 86 and 1658 38 cm 1 stretch vibration of co from the hydroxyl group at 1427 cm 1 stretch vibration of co in phenols at 1253 06 cm 1 the co band at 1054 cm 1 depicting the lignin structure of the wheat straw the modified wheat straw showed a maximum biosorption capacity of 50 76 mg g whereas the unmodified wheat straw showed a maximum biosorption capacity of 41 15 mg g the increase in biosorption after modification was attributed to the sorption that occurred on the external surface of the biosorbent by the non porous nano adsorbent present in the modified wheat straw the unmodified wheat straw only had micropores where the heavy metals could be adsorbed most of the biosorption process took place on the external surface thus all the metal binding functional groups were present on the exterior of the biosorbent the msw showed a superparamagnetic behaviour which means that it can be separated easily with application of an external field spent coffee grains consist of materials such as polyhydroxy polyphenol and tannin that can adsorb heavy metals 205 it was reported by edathil et al 87 that modifying coffee waste with fe3o4 nanoparticles via single pot co precipitation enhanced the biosorption capacity of pb2 ions there is a possibility of agglomeration of magnetic nanoparticles may occur but the presence of tannin can prevent this from taking place the modified coffee waste was porous wrinkled and had an entangled fibrous network the structure also showed a slight increase in the heterogeneity of the biosorbent a heterogeneous surface in favourable for biosorption to take place 158 the maximum biosorption capacity obtained was 41 15 mg g at a ph value of 7 3 and temperature of 25 c the ph at the point of zero charge was found to be 3 65 which indicates the surface charge of the biosorbent was negative and deemed favourable for adsorbing the positively charged lead ions 92 upon application of data into the intraparticle diffusion model it was concluded that biosorption took place in 3 stages in the first stage the adsorption rate was due to electrostatic forces between adsorbent surface and the adsorbate the second stage was attributed to intraparticle diffusion where the adsorbate enters the pores of the adsorbent and the third stage is when equilibrium was achieved as a result of reduced number of active sites thermodynamic studies indicated that the process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature according to the above discussion it can be concluded that chemical modification enhances biosorption performance the enhancement usually occurs due to introduction of new or more functional groups on the surface of the biosorbent which will facilitate mechanisms such as ion exchange complexation redox reactions etc removing compounds or groups that block potential active sites on the biosorbent increasing the available surface area for biosorption to take place increasing the porosity and heterogeneity of the surface many researchers used various modifying agents each of which gave different properties and degree of improvement more studies on the interactions between modifying agent and biosorbent will give a better understanding to further improve the biosorption efficiency in an adsorption system 5 3 factors effecting biosorption the biosorption process is greatly dependent on factors such as ph initial metal ion concentration adsorbent dose temperature and contact time and competing metal ions therefore it is necessary to find the optimum conditions for the adsorption process table 8 shows some typical results seen in studies on biosorption using various agricultural waste based biosorbents the following sections will discuss the effect of these factors according to various studies conducted using agricultural wastes based biosorbents 5 3 1 effects of ph on biosorption in an adsorption process the ph value is of great importance as it is the driving force for the exchange of h ions with the heavy metal ions it is an essential factor that helps to determine the state of ionization of functional groups present on the biosorbent surface 121 in table 9 the optimum ph for various agricultural waste based adsorbents along with the maximum adsorption capacities and experimental conditions such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t initial metal concentration co and dosage d are listed in a study conducted by kucukcongar et al 127 the authors found that the removal efficiency of nickel increased from a ph range of 2 6 and remained at a constant value of 78 at a ph value greater 6 at lower ph due to the competition between h ions and ni2 ions there is a reduction in removal percentage whereas at a higher ph deprotonation is the cause of increase in the removal percentage similar trends were noticed by various authors for example sobhanardakani and zandipak 110 studied the effect of ph on modified rice husk to remove ni2 and cd2 ions form aqueous solution the authors reported that in a ph range of 1 4 the percentage removal for ni2 and cd2 increased from 25 to 93 5 and from 16 to 85 respectively the highest adsorption was achieved at a ph value of 4 the increase in sorption on the modified rice husk from ph 1 4 can be attributed to the hydrolysis of the ni2 and cd2 ions at ph values lower than 4 the ni2 and cd2 ions may be competing with the h ions for the available active sites during the adsorption process therefore a low removal percentage is achieved however at a higher ph value due to the low concentration of the h ions there will be no competition with the ni2 and cd2 ions therefore the removal percentage was higher it has been reported in various studies that the maximum biosorption takes place between the ph of 3 6 15 26 110 145 for example shuhaimen et al 145 used modified carica papaya peels for the removal of cu2 ions the results showed that at a lower ph the removal percentage was only 17 the low removal percentage was attributed to functional groups on the biosorbent being in a protonated state which will repel against other species with the same charge there will be competing h ions that will occupy the active sites however at a higher ph deprotonation will occur forming negative charges and thereby attracting the cationic metal ions to form bonds with them the highest removal percentage was 75 at a ph value of 3 in another study by feng et al 88 the optimum ph was found to be in the range of 3 6 the authors varied the ph of the solution from 2 to 7 for the adsorption of pb2 cd2 and ni2 ions from aqueous solution on modified orange peel the authors found that the lowest adsorption occurred at a ph value of 2 and increased as the ph increased up to a value of 5 5 the decrease in sorption was attributed to the presence of competing h ions at lower ph at a higher ph the availability of larger number of ligands bearing negative charge will favour the adsorption of metal cations similarly the optimum ph was 4 in a study conducted by panneerselvam et al 132 in which the authors investigated the removal of ni2 ions using magnetically modified tea waste when the authors increased the ph from 2 to 4 the adsorption capacity increased at a ph value greater than 4 the adsorption capacity stayed constant ay et al 135 also reported an optimum ph of 5 when the authors used apple juice residue to remove lead ions from aqueous solution on varying the ph of the solution the authors saw low biosorption at ph levels of 1 5 2 5 the effect of ph on the biosorption process can also be studied in terms of ph at the point of zero charge phpzc 121 for example haghighat and ameri 35 reported that during a study conducted to adsorb lead ions on nano magnetic wheat straw the adsorption capacity reduced as the ph decreased this was attributed to clash between the competitive h ions and pb ii ions for adsorption on the active sites or functional groups the ph at the point of zero charge was found to be 2 1 and 2 6 for wheat straw and modified wheat straw respectively therefore it can be concluded that the surface of the modified biosorbent adsorbent was positively charged at ph 2 6 the adsorption of cations is known to be best at a ph value great than the ph at the point of zero charge which explains the increase in adsorption capacity above a ph value of 2 1 and 2 6 also the increase in ph value may have led to a more negatively charged adsorbent surface which favours adsorption it was reported by jiang et al 204 that at a ph higher than the ph at the point of zero charge higher adsorption capacity was achieved the authors found that the optimum ph for adsorption of pb2 ions by magnetic litchi peels was 6 above which pb oh 2 would form cationic species are favourably adsorbed at a ph greater than the ph at the point of zero charge and vice versa therefore the authors concluded that a ph of 6 would give the best results in general in most adsorption studies the optimal ph value was 3 6 5 3 2 effects of biosorbent dose or mass an increase in biosorbent dosage or mass can decrease the biosorption capacity due to reduced surface area agglomeration of particles electrostatic interactions less mixing inaccessibility to solute and lack of active sites 31 121 206 in table 10 the optimal adsorbent dosage d maximum adsorption capacities and experimental conditions such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t initial metal concentration co and ph are listed for example rosales et al 117 varied the biosorbent mass from 0 3 1 5 g for the removal of hexavalent chromium at an initial concentration of 35 mg l the maximum percentage removal of chromium vi was 99 5 at a biosorbent mass of 1 g the authors reported that an increase in removal efficiency up to 1 g could be due to the availability of large number of active sites on the surface of the biosorbent however the decrease in removal efficiency from 1 to 1 5 g biosorbent mass could be due to the partial aggregation of the biosorbent in another study kucukcongar et al 127 reported that upon increasing the dosage of magnetic peanut hull for the removal of nickel ions there was an increase in removal percentage but there was a decrease in adsorption capacity similarly basu et al 120 also reported comparable results when they increased the dose of cucumber peel biosorbent for the removal of cadmium they reported that at a higher dosage of the biosorbent the percentage removal increased until a certain amount after which the percentage removal decreased due to the presence of excessive active sites in comparison to the amount of heavy metal ions it could also be attributed to the electrostatic forces among the adsorbent cells and due to the interference in between the active sites of the biosorbent jiang et al 204 also noticed similar results and concluded that a litchi peel dose of 5 g l was the optimum dosage for the removal of pb2 at a higher dose the removal efficiency decreased because the adsorbent formed aggregates and also because of the reduction in available surface area for adsorption on the contrary sobhanardakani and zandipak 110 increased the mass of modified rice husk from 0 08 to 0 3 g for the removal of ni2 and cd2 ions the results of their study showed that there was an increase in removal percentage from 50 to 93 5 for ni2 and 33 5 to 85 5 for cd2 the authors attributed the increase in the removal percentage to the availability of larger number of active sites and increase in surface area similarly another study conducted by abbaszadeh et al 207 the authors varied the mass of magnetically modified papaya peel waste that was used to remove pb2 ions from aqueous solution it was found that the adsorption efficiency increased upon increasing the mass of the biosorbent from 10 to 50 mg due to the availability of active sites but there were no significant changes in the adsorption efficiency from 50 to 200 mg the lack of any further increase in adsorption efficiency could be due to the system reaching equilibrium 97 5 3 3 effect of initial metal ion concentration initial metal ion concentration is another factor that can influence the biosorption capacity of a biosorbent many studies have reported that low initial metal ion concentration gives higher biosorption capacity in table 11 the optimum initial metal ion concentration co for various agriculture waste biosorbents along with their maximum adsorption capacities and experimental conditions such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t dosage d and ph are listed for example a study was conducted by kucukcongar et al 127 in which the authors varied the concentration of nickel from 10 to 100 mg l to investigate its effect on the adsorption efficiency of magnetically modified peanut hull it was seen that the removal efficiency decreased with the increase in metal concentration the removal efficiency at 10 mg l and 100 mg l was 82 8 and 32 6 respectively this could be attributed to the lack of active sites available for the nickel ions when the metal concentration is increased at a lower initial metal concentration the ratio of available active sites to the heavy metal is large whereas at a high initial metal ion concertation this ratio is low because most of the active sites are saturated therefore low biosorption efficiency would be expected 203 208 a similar trend was observed by haghighat and ameri 35 when they studied the effect of pb2 concentration on the removal efficiency of modified and unmodified wheat straw the results showed that at a lower metal ion concentration the removal efficiency was higher the authors varied the lead concentration from 10 to 1000 mg l they found that at a low concentration of 10 mg l the removal efficiency of modified and unmodified wheat straw was 89 3 and 88 respectively at a lead concentration of 1000 mg l the removal percentages were reduced to 18 9 for modified wheat straw and 16 for unmodified wheat straw this could be because the adsorption of lead occurred at higher energy sites when the concentration of lead was low on the other hand when the concentration of lead is high adsorption may occur on lower energy sites an increase in metal concentration also results in the decrease of initial rate of external diffusion and an increase in intra particles which could reduce the biosorption capacity 97 sharma and bhalerao 209 also noticed similar results when they varied cr vi concentrations to investigate the removal efficiency by banana peels the authors varied the metal concentration from 5 to 250 mg l and found that the removal efficiency decreased upon increasing the metal concentration shakoor et al 134 varied as iii and as v concentrations to investigate its effect on the adsorption capacity of modified watermelon rind the authors reported that the maximum adsorption took place at a concentration of 4 5 mg l and any further increase in concentration did not enhance the adsorption capacity similarly ratan et al 129 varied nickel concentration from 0 to 60 mg l to study its effect on removal efficiency by modified coconut coir pith the authors noticed a decrease in removal efficiency with the increase in initial metal concentration this could be because at lower efficiencies plenty of unoccupied active sites are available for biosorption to take place 198 5 3 4 effect of temperature temperature in a biosorption process plays a crucial role in the uptake of heavy metals in table 12 optimal temperature t maximum removal capacities thermodynamic parameters and experimental conditions such as contact time ct dosage d and ph are listed for various agriculture based adsorbents are listed factors such as enthalpy δh entropy δs gibbs free energy δg are able to describe the enthalpy change randomness and spontaneity of the system the enthalpy can determine if the process is endothermic or exothermic for example a study was conducted to adsorb cadmium and lead on spent grain 201 upon increasing the temperature adsorption of lead and cadmium on spent grain increased when the temperature was increased from 15 c to 55 c the sorption of cadmium increased from 14 21 mg g to 16 20 mg g whereas as the sorption of lead increased from 27 8 mg g to 36 68 mg g the δh value was found to be 34 36 kj mol and 14 12 kj mol for lead and cadmium respectively this explains that the process was endothermic in nature in another study the adsorption of hexavalent chromium on modified groundnut hull was studied by increasing the temperature from 30 to 60 c the results revealed that the adsorption capacity decreased as the temperature increased from 30 to 60 c this indicates that the process was an exothermic process 113 similarly qu et al 70 saw a decrease in sorption with an increase in temperature indicating that the process was exothermic it was reported by joshi et al 131 that increasing the temperature enhanced the diffusion and interaction between metal ions and the active sites on the biosorbent the authors saw an increase in cd2 and pb2 sorption on sio2 teawaste nanocomposites when the temperature was increased from 30 c to 50 c the sorption percentage of cd2 increased from 95 2 to 99 7 and the sorption percentage of pb2 increased from 89 8 to 95 7 similar results were obtained in a study conducted by sharma and bhalerao 209 in which the authors investigated the effect of cr vi sorption on banana peels by increasing the temperature from 20 c to 40 c the removal of cr vi increased from 41 69 to 49 69 upon increasing the temperature and the δh value was found to be positive the process was endothermic in nature moreover the δg value was found to be negative and low which means that the driving force was high and could explain the higher biosorption value 5 3 5 effect of contact time in various studies it was reported that biosorption of heavy metals takes place very quick at the initial stages of the process this is generally due to abundance of available active sites for the heavy metals to bind to in table 13 the optimum contact time for various agriculture waste based biosorbents has been listed along with the maximum removal capacities and experimental conditions such as adsorbent dosage d temperature t initial metal ion concentration co and ph for example owalude and tella 113 reported rapid percentage removal of hexavalent chromium by modified groundnut hull in the first 30 min this was attributed to the large surface area available for adsorption of hexavalent chromium in the first 30 min however the authors did not notice any significant increase in adsorption capacity after 30 min process equilibrium was attained in 80 min when all the available active sites were saturated by metal ions in another study by pei and liu 118 the authors reported that the adsorption of lead ions on grapefruit peel increased with increase in contact time it was stated that in pectin rich fruits the time taken to reach equilibrium is rapid 210 the biosorption in this study was quick and equilibrium was reached in 1 5 h this was due to larger number of available active sites during the initial stages of biosorption jiang et al 204 also reported similar results when the authors varied the contact time from 5 to 20 min to remove pb2 using modified litchi peels the sorption was seen to increase from 88 to 93 the maximum sorption was seen at 120 min the same conclusion was drawn by ratan et al 129 when the authors noticed that sorption of nickel ions on modified coconut coir pith increased with the increase in contact time due to the availability of active sites for adsorption equilibrium was attained at 2 h similarly sharma and bhalerao 209 described that sorption of cr vi on banana peels increased with increase in contact time 5 4 desorption and reusability of biosorbents the two most important deciding factors on the practical applicability of a biosorbent are its adsorption capacity and its ability to be regenerated from an economic standpoint the reusability of spent biosorbents is a major criterion for its selection to be used at an industrial scale 211 various adsorption desorption a d studies are listed in table 14 along with the desorbing agent used removal percentage capacity after desorption and recovery percentage of heavy metals the regeneration process involves the separation of the pollutants from the biosorbent after removal ideally the biosorbent will be able to maintain its morphological structure as well as its adsorption efficiency the biosorbent should be used for a number of cycles before being replaced to reduce cost and reduce further environmental pollution commonly used desorbing agents include organic acids mineral acids alkalis base metallic salts solvents and complexing agents 149 212 acid solutions are typically useful for desorbing most of the metallic ions due to the introduction of h ions which decreases the ph and protonates the oxygen groups present on the surface of the biosorbent 213 the h or h3o ions will be in competition with the heavy metal ions present on the active sites of the adsorbent and the acid radical ions form complexes with heavy metals thereby desorbing the heavy metals a few examples of commonly used acid based eluents are hydrochloric acid nitric acid and sulphuric acid some widely used alkali bases are sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide and sodium carbonate 212 complexing agents also effectively remove heavy metals by forming stable complexes with the heavy metals on active sites of the adsorbent surface 214 metallic salts desorb heavy metals through ion exchange process 196 215 an ideal desorbing agent is one that is cost effective environmentally friendly is easily separable from the biosorbent and has a high affinity towards the biosorbent the desorption process can be conducted in a batch or column process generally it would be more ideal for the process to take place in a packed column where the eluent is able to flow through the column 149 hcl is a commonly used desorbing agent due to its ability to protonate the surface of the biosorbent and facilitate desorption it has been used in various studies for desorbing heavy metals from biosorbents 119 121 138 for example owalude and tella 113 used 0 01 0 1 1 0 and 1 20 m hcl solution to desorb chromium vi adsorbed onto modified groundnut hull the authors were able to desorb 68 of chromium upon contact with 0 3 m hcl the solution was filtered to recover the biosorbent and then heated at 80 c for 24 h in an oven after biosorbent recovery it was reused up to at least 3 cycles another desorption study using hcl was conducted by lasheen et al 89 in which the authors investigated the desorption pb2 from modified orange peels the spent orange peel was treated with 0 2 m hcl to convert it into hydrogen form for superior adsorption adsorption desorption cycles showed that the removal percentage for pb2 was more than 96 for the first cycle and was between 93 5 and 91 5 in the second fourth cycle the adsorption did not significantly decrease even after four cycles in a study conducted by villen guzman et al 94 the removal efficiency of ni2 from modified lemon peel remained high up to 90 even after 5 adsorption desorption cycle using hno3 and h2so4 as the desorbing agents guo et al 33 also used 0 1 m hcl to recover cu2 cd2 pb2 zn2 and ni2 from modified orange peel even after 10 adsorption desorption cycles the removal efficiency remained high for cu2 cd2 and pb2 at 97 90 and 99 respectively however zn2 and ni2 showed a significant decrease of 78 and 75 respectively after 10 cycles this may be due to the saturation of active sites on the adsorbent surface similarly liu et al 102 used 0 01 m hcl to desorb cd2 and pb2 ions from modified sugarcane bagasse when the 3 cycles of adsorption desorption of modified and unmodified sugarcane bagasse were compared the modified sugarcane bagasse shows higher removal rates the removal rate of cd2 was 31 9 higher for modified sugarcane bagasse and 43 higher for pb2 the citric acid and fe3o4 aided in the strengthening of the biosorbent as well as creating more active sites for adsorption in various studies the authors used multiple desorbing agents to find out the optimum one for example abbaszadeh et al 207 used desorbing agents such as h2so4 hno3 and hcl to find the most suitable desorbing agent for desorbing lead ions from magnetically modified papaya peel waste it was found that maximum desorption of pb2 ions was achieved after shaking for 2 min hcl 0 1 mol l with a volume of 3 ml yielded the best desorption the adsorbent was further washed using hcl 0 1 mol l and deionized water to test reusability the adsorbent could be reused for up to 10 cycles with a reusability efficiency greater than 84 ahmad et al 195 also carried out desorption studies using hcl 0 1 m h2so4 0 1 m and hno3 0 1 m to desorb pb2 and cd2 ions from chemically oxidized pineapple peel similar to the results obtained by abbaszadeh et al 207 hcl 0 1 m was the most efficient and desorbed 90 of cd2 and 87 of pb2 another comparative study to find the best desorbing agent was conducted by kucukcongar et al 127 where the authors used 0 1 n hcl and 0 5 n hno3 to recover ni2 ions from magnetic peanut hull waste during the second adsorption cycle after the desorption results showed a significant decrease in the adsorption the removal efficiency was 27 4 for 0 1 n hcl and 30 2 for 0 5 n hno3 the decrease in the removal efficiency was attributed to structural changes caused due to acid treatments for desorption desorption treatments can often damage the structure and morphology of the adsorbent therefore the desorbing agents and concentrations need to be chosen carefully in order to achieve high recovery of heavy metal and maintain the structure of the adsorbent 6 column studies most of the adsorption studies conducted for the removal of heavy metals in the past few decades evaluate the process in a batch system however the adsorption process on an industrial scale generally takes place in a continuous system some types of reactors used are continuous fluidize bed and pulsed bed continuous moving bed continuous fixed bed reactors upflow or downflow among the types of reactors fixed bed column configuration is preferred for heavy metal removal 216 it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the adsorbent in a continuous flow system a list of studies using agriculture based biosorbents conducted in continuous systems including column properties have been listed in table 15 various mathematical models have been used to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of the columns in an industrial scale operation these mathematical models are based on assumption of axial dispersion external mass transfer intraparticle diffusion and nonlinear isotherms some of these models include thomas bed depth service time bdst the adams and bohart model yoon nelson clark wolborska and modified dose response model and it is noteworthy that the thomas model is widely used for column studies 216 this model is based on the assumption that the adsorption process follows the langmuir isotherm model with no axial dispersion details of this process are depicted in fig 5 column studies are based on breakthrough curves these curves are a graphical plot of contaminant effluent versus time factors such as bed height flowrate and amount of adsorbent in the column also greatly affect the adsorption capacity 218 219 for instance in a study conducted by cheraghi et al 220 the authors used sesame waste biomass for the removal of cd ii from aqueous solutions in a fixed bed column the authors reported that with the increase in bed depth from 2 4 and 6 cm there was an increase in removal efficiency to 67 67 75 88 and 77 respectively this can be attributed to increase in biosorbent mass in the column and thereby the adsorbent total mass surface area available for adsorption which would provide more adsorption sites on the other hand it was observed that with the increase in bed depth the cd ii uptake capacity had reduced at a bed height of 2 cm an optimum breakthrough curve was achieved the authors also varied the flow rate from 2 5 to 4 5 ml min the results showed that as the flow rate increased from 2 5 and 4 5 ml min the uptake capacity of cd ii reduced from 22 88 to 15 13 mg g moreover by fitting the experimental data into mathematical models the yoon nelson and thomas models were able predict the adsorption performance for cd ii adsorption in a fixed bed column rosales et al 117 also evaluated the effect of flow rate on the adsorption of cr vi on grapefruit peelings based on the homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm with an adsorption column of height 1 5 m volume 100 l and internal diameter 0 3 m the results explained that upon increasing the flow rate the breakthrough time was obtained earlier and the biosorbent was saturated in a shorter amount of time at an effluent concentration of 90 of the initial value the biosorbent would be exhausted in 62 5 44 34 5 29 days for cr vi with flow rates of 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 l min nakkeeran et al 221 also noticed the similar trend when the authors studied the effect on adsorption by varying flow rates of the cr vi laden influent on strychnos nux vomica fruit shell it was reported that the breakthrough time had declined as flow rate increased the biosorption capacity had also reduced as the flow rate increased moreover the removal percentage of cr vi reduced from 65 14 to 34 69 with an increase in flow rate upon evaluation of mathematical models the thomas and bdst model presented better agreement with the equilibrium data the effect of initial metal concentration was also evaluated at a fixed bed height of 3 cm and a constant flow rate of 5 ml min the results revealed a decrease in breakthrough time with an increase in initial metal concentration the biosorption capacity had increased with the increase in initial metal concentration 221 this can be attributed to the presence of cr vi molecules on the film layer formed on the surface this will initiate a rapid movement at higher concentration of metal to the biosorbent surface because of elevation in the coefficient of mass transfer the removal percentage had reduced from 65 14 to 37 24 with the increase in metal ion concentration like many studies higher removal of chromium occurred at low flow rates low initial metal ion concentration and larger bed height 7 biosorption of heavy metals from real industrial wastewater industrial wastewater consists of various types and quantities of pollutants depending upon the industry they are discharged from effluents from industrial wastewater usually consists of different types of ions that can compete with the heavy metal ions for active sites on the surface of the biosorbent therefore it is necessary to analyse the biosorption process using real industrial wastewater as most of the studies use synthetic heavy metal wastewater for example razak et al 226 used phosphoric acid to modify kenaf fiber for the removal of copper ii ions from electroplating and wood treatment industry the adsorption capacity of copper ions from the electroplating industry and from the wood treatment industry was 33 55 mg g and 37 18 mg g respectively in a single metal ion synthetically spiked system the adsorption capacity was 57 14 mg g electroplating industry contains various other metal ions as copper zinc tin and gold whereas wood treatment effluent is rich in arsenate therefore more than one type of ions was competing for the active sites on the biosorbent and reduced the adsorption capacity in another study abdolali et al 227 used a mixture of tea waste tw maple leaves ml and mandarin peel mp to remove cd cu pb and zn from real and synthetic wastewater the real wastewater was taken from the primary effluent downstream of the malabar wwtp sedimentation tanks collected from sydney waterplant nsw australia the experiment was carried out in a packed bed column prior to the adsorption experiment the sewage was settled for 24 h and filtered using a 150 μm sieve the wastewater was spiked with heavy metal 20 mg l solution due to undetectable amounts in municipal wastewater the ph was not altered the wastewater consisted of various other contaminants mentioned in table 16 the results showed that the biosorbent removed more than 90 of cd ii cu ii pb ii and zn ii ions from 3227 2617 1714 and 2019 ml municipal wastewater in 322 261 171 and 201 min respectively it was also reported that the biosorption capacity was similar to that achieved with synthetic wastewater bulgariu et al 228 used sulphur based soy waste for removal of pb ii cu ii and ni ii from industrial water from a local printing circuit board company in the wastewater samples the concentration of heavy metal ions was adjusted to 0 4 mmol m ii l it was reported that 98 of the heavy metals were removed from the water and achieved the permissible limit the values of pb ii cu ii and ni ii had reduced from 83 70 mg l 25 50 mg l 23 50 mg l to 0 4381 mg l 0 1673 mg l 0 6237 mg l after biosorption 8 cost analysis cost analysis is a very essential factor to evaluate the practical applicability of the adsorption process in general it is often mentioned that agricultural wastes are very cost effective in comparison to commercial adsorbents this section aims to compile some of the scattered information regarding the costs of biosorbents the cost analysis studies are listed in table 17 in a study conducted by sharma and ayub 231 the authors conducted a thorough cost analysis of using pea pisum sativum pod peels tea camellia sinensis ginger zingiber officinale mix and banana musa lacatan peels used to adsorb cr vi from wastewater according to their analysis the cost to adsorb 1 g of cr vi from wastewater was rs 9 14 rs 4 71 and rs 3 11 respectively the cost is significantly cheaper when compared to adsorption by commercial activated carbon which was rs 142 145 peanut hull is a very commonly used agricultural waste that is employed in biosorption processes in a study conducted by ali et al 203 the author stated that the egyptian peanut hulls that have been used to remove cu ii in their study were inexpensive and cost l e 800 t the finished product including all costs such as peanut hulls electrical energy handling transportation chemicals drying etc was approximately l e 2000 t another common and abundantly available agricultural waste is rice husk it was reported that the cost of using chemically activated risk husk as an adsorbent was 2 579 usd which is very economical this cost covers collection of the rice husk cleaning costs size reduction costs drying and pyrolysis costs and chemical activation costs since the agricultural waste was collected by farmers in this study it was free of cost 232 moreover during mass production these costs are expected to drop further elhafez et al 233 also performed a techno economic analysis on the usage of rice husk based biosorbent rice husk as a raw material can be sold at a low price of 42 t for a 1200 t y production rate the operational cost was estimated to be 50 400 y the authors estimated that rice husk based adsorbent would cost 420 t on the basis of an adsorbent of 1200 tons year it was estimated that the revenue of the plant would be higher than the operational costs leaving a net profit of 144 000 y more details on the cost calculations are listed in table 17 sugarcane bagasse is another effective and common agricultural waste used in the adsorption of heavy metals in a study conducted by gupta et al 234 it was reported that the total cost for the preparing 1 kg of adsorbent was estimated as inr 49 28 inr 309 65 and inr 103 40 for sugarcane bagasse acid activated sugarcane bagasse and base activated sugarcane bagasse respectively chemical modification raises the price of the adsorbent material in this study the unmodified sugarcane per gram of cu ii removal cost inr 10 18 the cost to remove of 1 g of cu ii from the wastewater using acid activated sugarcane bagasse and base activated sugarcane bagasse was inr 57 88 and inr 50 19 respectively although the chemical modification increased the price it was still found to be significantly cheaper than the commercial activated carbon purchased by the authors which costed inr 649 47 bhatnagar et al 86 reported that lemon peels were an efficient an economic option for the removal of heavy metals from waste water the cost of lemon peels was approximated to 5 6 usd 100 200 tonnes whereas the cost of activated carbon was estimated to 2000 usd tonne the total cost of the final adsorbent including costs of electrical energy transportation chemicals was estimated to 100 200 usd tonne which is about 10 times cheaper than the activated carbon fawzy et al 235 performed a techno economic analysis on adsorption of cadmium ions by olive leaves olea europaea l waste it was assumed that annual feed of industrial wastewater which is 7000 m3 year was being treated with adsorption as the tertiary stage of the wastewater treatment plant as shown in table 17 the net cost which is bc benefit cost oc operating cost for the application of adsorption as tertiary treatment was 0 014 usd m3 the positive value depicts that the adsorption system would eventually gain financial profits and compensate for the ac amortization cost the payback period was calculated as ac 0 0080 usd m3 the annual net profit 0 0014 usd m3 year which was 5 7 years this duration was shorter than 10 years which was the lifetime of the implying the practicality of the investment 9 conclusion future prospects and recommendations to address the concern of heavy metal removal adsorption process has various advantages such as ease of operability low sludge production removal of heavy metals presents at a low concentration when compared to other commonly used technologies such as membrane technology ion exchange coagulation flocculation etc biosorbents modified chemically via acids alkalis polymers grafting co polymerization and with metal salts to produce magnetic biosorbents and modifying with other organic chemicals have proven to be a cost effective and highly efficient chemical modification with acids often showed the highest sorption efficiency it can be concluded that most of the biosorption processes follow the langmuir or freundlich isotherm model more commonly pseudo second order kinetic model is applicable to the biosorption process the process is usually spontaneous and endothermic in nature the regeneration of biosorbents was most effective when acids were used as eluents which allowed some biosorbents to be reused efficiently up to 10 times the cost analysis revealed that agricultural waste based biosorbents are significantly cheaper than commercial biosorbents such as activated carbon however there are many key areas of biosorption that need to be addressed in order to bring lab scale studies to large scale applications in the industry most of the studies are based upon mono metal synthetically prepared heavy metal solutions real wastewater needs to be used in the experiments wastewater consists of various other contaminants including other heavy metals which can create competition between ions and inherently saturate the active sites quickly more research into multi metal interactions in a solution can help in understanding prevalence of metal ions on a particular biosorbent there is a tremendous amount of lab based research on the removal of heavy metals but there is a lack of pilot studies that are conducted on an industrial scale comparative studies between commercially used adsorbent material and novel biosorbents should be conducted in order to analyse the advantages of the process over existing processes there is a lack of biosorption studies that are conducted in continuous reactors most of the experiments are conducted in flasks in flasks it is easy to control factors contributing to biosorption studies should be conducted with reactors such as continuous flow reactors and packed bed reactors to understand large scale implementations better in addition regeneration of biosorbents should be tested in a continuous flow column running parallel to the adsorption process operating in a continuous flow column chemical modifications play a huge role in the performance of a biosorbent development in techniques to increase the mechanical strength of biosorbents and increase available adsorption sites by increasing surface area pores and number of metal binding functional groups is essential hybrid biosorbents formed by combining biosorbents with other natural compounds such as nanobentonite chitosan and cellulose based biosorbents should be explored for improved performance additionally combination of agricultural wastes with different types or synthetic and organic polymers should be explored widely one of the major drawbacks of biosorbents is there low mechanical strength polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylidene fluoride can incorporated in the biosorbent backbone to increase their strength combining biosorption with other wastewater treatment steps can be explored for example combining biosorption process with coagulation photo electrocatalysis electro coagulation etc because the nature of wastewater will not allow treatment with biosorbents alone biosorbents can be used as a pre treatment step for various industries groundwater or stormwater where the concentration of heavy metals is low performing chemical modification on biosorbents tremendously increases the adsorption capacity however this also means that a large amount of chemicals will be used and the overall production cost will also increase the economic aspect of the process is often neglected therefore an end to end study on biosorption using modified agricultural wastes needs to be conducted to understand the techno economic aspects of the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13084,in recent years with the global increase in industrialization there has been a significant increase in the amount of toxic pollutants such as heavy metals being released into water bodies adsorption is considered as one of the most attractive methods due to its high efficiency and ability to remove heavy metals even at low concentration agricultural wastes based biosorbents have attracted great interest due to their capability to effectively remove heavy metals from wastewater chemical modifications on biosorbents can significantly improve the biosorption capacities and the longevity of the biosorbents most of the adsorption studies followed the langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherm models the pseudo second order kinetic model best fitted most of the adsorption kinetic studies moreover ion exchange electrostatic attraction and chelation were the governing adsorption mechanisms in most of the studies the adsorption process was usually spontaneous and endothermic in nature the regeneration of biosorbents was most effective when acids were used as eluents and this had allowed some biosorbents to be reused efficiently up to 10 times to elucidate a practical perspective analysis on column studies adsorption performance using industrial wastewater and cost analysis had been conducted cost analysis proved that agricultural wastes based biosorbents are cheaper than traditional adsorbents such as activated carbon graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption cost analysis kinetics and isotherms regeneration wastewater treatment 1 introduction over the last few decades there has been a dire need to solve the problem of heavy metal pollution in water heavy metals are extremely toxic metallic elements that end up in the environment due to anthropogenic activities industries such as mining metal processing fertilizer industry tanneries etc are some of the major sources of heavy metal contamination 1 heavy metals can be present in the environment in dissolved or particulate phase the dissolved form is known to be more hazardous 2 heavy metal pollution adversely affects the health of humans animals soil and aquatic life 3 they can easily disrupt the food chain due to their ability to accumulate in living cells and organs 4 properties of heavy metals such as their non biodegradability mobility and persistence make these elements very harmful 5 6 the atomic structure and the electron shells of these elements attribute to their highly reactive nature and ability to perform physiochemical and biochemical activities and thus may result in deleterious effects on the environment 4 industrial wastewater consists of various types of contaminants which is why various pre treatment steps are performed before the heavy metals can be targeted for removal 6 generally heavy metal removal technology falls into the tertiary treatment category 7 over the years various chemical biological and physical technologies have emerged as a result of the need to eliminate pollutants from wastewater 8 some examples of these technologies are ion exchange nanofiltration ozonation floatation membrane technology coagulation chemical precipitation and nanotechnology 4 9 13 however these technologies have certain disadvantages such as low removal efficiency secondary sludge production disposal issues and expensive operational costs 4 14 15 adsorption is a powerful technology that has gained a lot of attention over the other technologies for heavy metal removal 6 16 17 this process has several advantages such as the ability to treat heavy metals that are present in low concentration 1 100 mg l low operational costs and regeneration ability 8 18 various types of adsorbent materials including natural biological and waste based adsorbents have been evaluated for heavy metal removal of which activated carbon is widely used commercially 19 activated carbon is very efficient in removing heavy metals but is generally very expensive due to its production cost which includes an energy consuming and high temperature carbonization process 20 owing to this drawback researchers over the last few decades have been paying more attention to cost effective and efficient adsorbents that can be produced from inexpensive biomass agricultural wastes are a category of biomass that are abundantly available in the environment and have the ability to efficiently adsorb heavy metals on their surface effectively 1 14 21 25 the surface characteristics of these biosorbents such as availability of metal binding functional groups and a highly porous area aid in entrapping heavy metal ions within their pores 19 however these agricultural based biosorbents are required to undergo chemical modification to improve the adsorption capacity structural stability and reusability biosorbent modification can typically be divided into physical and chemical modifications physical modification involves breaking down of adsorbents to desired sizes and gasification at high temperature with gases such as carbon dioxide 26 27 a common physical modification method involves surface activation by using nitrogen gas to produce activated carbon from the biosorbent 28 on the other hand while performing chemical modification on a biosorbent acids such as hydrochloric acid 29 and nitric acid 29 alkalis such as sodium hydroxide 30 and potassium hydroxide 31 salts such as calcium chloride 32 and potassium chloride 33 as well as other substances such as iron oxide zinc oxide copper oxide methanol etc are commonly used as modifying agents 34 35 the aim of this review article is to systematically review the application of chemically modified agricultural wastes for the removal of heavy metals from water and wastewater this review article provides the recent advances in the field by comprehensively covering the adsorption performances of these biosorbents along with their underlying adsorption mechanisms and critical analysis of the effect of several important experimental parameters governing the adsorption process the article also elucidates the practical aspects such as column studies cost analysis performance of biosorbents using real industrial wastewater and desorption studies of various agricultural wastes which are often neglected in biosorption studies the inclusion of these topics is to allow the readers to have a better understanding on what is preventing biosorbents to replace existing commercial adsorbents such as ion exchange resin and activated carbon in addition recommendations have been provided to enable lab scale biosorption to be eventually applied at industrial scale 2 heavy metals and their harmful effects on human health heavy metals generally refer to metal and metalloids that have an atomic density greater than 4 g cm3 which is 5 times greater than water 36 38 some common heavy metals are arsenic chromium cadmium lead copper zinc nickel iron and barium the toxic behaviour of heavy metals is exacerbated due to its inability to naturally degrade over time the accumulation of these heavy metals in plants soil and aquatic life is a pathway to infiltrate the food chain heavy metal accumulation in the human body can cause serious health issues such as cancer impaired growth and reproduction neurological damage permanent brain damage encephalopathy and chronic damage to the nervous system 39 heavy metals are very harmful even at trace amounts therefore it is a necessity to develop efficient methods for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater the most commonly found heavy metals in the environment due to industrial pollution are provided in table 1 2 1 conventional methods for removal of heavy metals over the years numerous technologies have been implemented for the removal of heavy metals membrane filtration chemical precipitation ion exchange coagulation flocculation adsorption and electrodialysis are some examples of the technologies however most of these techniques have limitations that make them inefficient 46 2 1 1 membrane filtration membrane filtration is a popular method used in industries to treat pollutants in wastewater it can treat organic compounds suspended solids and inorganic compounds such as heavy metals there are various types of membranes such as ultrafiltration membranes microfiltration membranes nanofiltration membranes and reverse osmosis membranes the type of membrane is chosen on the basis of the size of the pollutant 41 although membrane filtration is effective it has limitations such as high initial cost high maintenance cost membrane fouling and limited lifespan 46 2 1 2 ion exchange in this technique an ion exchanger such as resins are used to remove the desired ions by an exchange mechanism the ion exchange material is able to replace its cation with the heavy metal ion in the polluted stream two examples of commonly used ion exchange resins are strongly acidic resins with sulfonic acid groups so3h and weakly acid resins with carboxylic acid groups cooh 47 although ion exchangers are efficient in removing heavy metals their capital and operation cost are high 48 2 1 3 electrodialysis this process involves the use of a semi permeable ion exchange membrane through which the heavy metal polluted water is passed by applying an electric potential the membrane sheets are either cationic or anionic in nature in a positively or negatively charged ionic membrane the anions are directed towards the anode and the cations are directed towards the cathode 49 2 1 4 chemical precipitation in this method the heavy metals ions react with a chemical to form insoluble precipitates like hydroxides and sulphide precipitates this can then be removed by sedimentation or filtration techniques 47 the operation of this process is simple but there is a large amount of sludge generation and this can increase the maintenance cost tremendously 46 2 1 5 coagulation and flocculation coagulation and flocculation is a ph dependent process which involves the addition of coagulants such as ferric alum salts the process destabilises the particle to cause sedimentation after that the size of the unstable particle is increased by flocculating the particles into floccules the drawbacks of this process include production of toxic sludge heavy use of chemicals and high operational costs 46 47 2 1 6 adsorption adsorption is defined as a process in which ions and molecules are bonded onto a solid material 10 50 52 adsorbent surfaces are mostly heterogeneous the adsorption sites are occupied from the highest energy sites to the lowest energy sites 53 the adsorption process creates a layer of adsorbate on the surface 54 adsorption process mainly occurs in three steps firstly the heavy metal from the bulk solution transfers to the adsorbents surface secondly the adsorption of the heavy metal on the surface occurs and lastly the heavy metals transport within the adsorbent 41 some of the factors that contribute to the adsorption efficiency are pore volume surface area polarity number of active sites and functional groups 55 adsorption is one of the most commonly technology used for pollutant clean up in wastewater 47 52 it is a very efficient process that is able to eliminate heavy metals present at low concentrations produce less sludge and maintain low operational cost 15 56 57 various types of adsorbent materials have been used for the removal of heavy metals they can be classified into inorganic bio based carbon based and polymeric adsorbents 58 some examples of commercially available adsorbents on the market are activated carbon silica gel and alumina 59 examples of different types of adsorbents are presented in table 2 typically an adsorbent material should be low cost have good structural and mechanical stability have high adsorption efficiency have a large surface area and have good regeneration capability the most commonly used adsorbent material is activated carbon this is because it has outstanding properties such as large surface area and excellent adsorption ability although it is very efficient for heavy metal removal it is very costly for instance regeneration process alone of spent activated carbon comprises of 75 of its operating cost in a fixed bed gas operator 60 another issue with these adsorbent materials is the lack of satisfactory disposal systems 3 biosorption 3 1 biosorption and its principals biosorption is a physio chemical process in which a biological material is used for the removal of selected substances from an aqueous solution 61 due to the growing demand of finding environmentally friendly approaches towards pollutant removal more attention is being drawn towards green chemistry or sustainable chemistry biosorption is a process that complies with these guidelines some of the principles of green chemistry are as follows 62 1 replace toxic chemical reagents 2 utilize safer reagents 3 avoid the generation secondary wastes that cannot be recycled 4 reuse reagents 5 reduce energy consumption 6 use techniques that are ecofriendly to detect analytes 7 using automation and developments on a microscale level biosorption falls under the category of adsorption with the difference being that the adsorbent is made from a biological matrix the sorption process may include various mechanisms depending upon the type of sorbate the biosorbent being used and other environmental factors biosorption is a metabolically independent and physiochemical process which may involve mechanisms such as ion exchange chelation electrostatic interaction adsorption redox reactions precipitation and surface complexation the possible mechanisms of biosorption are depicted in fig 1 the biosorption process will continue until it reaches an equilibrium state 63 this process has several advantages such as using cost effective and sustainable materials the process being metabolically independent effectively usage of waste materials and high removal efficiency even at low heavy metal concentrations 64 biosorbents can be classified as green adsorbents 21 they can be categorized into algae microbial and agricultural wastes based biosorbents one of the major advantages of using dead biomass such as agricultural wastes as opposed to living biomass is that they do not require a growth media and nutrients for their maintenance which will reduce the overall operational cost the process will also allow easier mathematical and statistical modelling of heavy metal uptake 55 63 65 the fabrication of green adsorbents in general requires lesser energy and can be recycled easily which reduces the overall waste production 46 3 1 1 steps involved in biosorption studies adsorption studies are generally conducted in the following steps 1 first the biosorbent undergoes pre treatment this may include sieving milling and washing 2 then the biosorbent is physically or and chemically modified to improve the availability of functional groups and active sites on the biosorbent for maximum biosorption to take place 3 the biosorbent is then characterized by using techniques such as scanning electron microscopy sem field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray diffraction xrd transmission electron microscopy tem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis various experimental factors that affect biosorption include ph temperature adsorbent dose metal concentration contact time and presence of competing ions these factors are varied to find the optimum conditions for biosorption after that the amount of heavy metal adsorbed is measured through analytical techniques such as atomic absorption spectrometry aas and inductively coupled plasma analysis icp 4 adsorption kinetic and adsorption isotherm studies are conducted to determine the adsorption rates adsorption equilibrium and maximum adsorption capacity 5 next desorption is conducted to recover the heavy metals from the wastewater and for the regeneration of the biosorbent material for further study and use 3 2 mechanisms involved in the removal of heavy metals by agricultural wastes in heavy metal removal agricultural wastes are typically available in large quantities and can easily be transformed into efficient heavy metal adsorbents 20 these wastes mainly consist of various types of inorganic and organic matter such as hemicellulose cellulose lignin protein carbohydrates pectin etc in their cell wall 66 the biosorption process of heavy metal on agricultural wastes mostly is due to functional groups such as carboxyl amine and hydroxyl groups 23 agricultural wastes also contain different types of minerals and carbon content that are responsible to drive physical forces such as van der waals forces dipole dipole interaction hydrophobicity steric interaction and hydrogen bonding 67 in order to understand the mechanism of heavy metal adsorption in biosorbents the functional groups present on the biosorbent surface must be analysed 50 the interactions between metal ions and functional groups need to be studied for a better understanding of the biosorption process agricultural wastes generally consist of various functional groups such hydroxyl group present in alcohol and carbohydrates carboxyl present in fatty acids protein and organic acids ester found in lipids keto group aldehyde and amine groups found in nuclei acids and proteins etc 11 68 these functional groups aid in binding metal cations and anions by forming coordinate complexes 23 the biosorbents generally have large surface area are very porous and consists of ligands these characteristics make agricultural based biosorbents desirable for adsorption 19 various mechanisms including complexation ion exchange chelation precipitation and physisorption can be involved in the metal ion uptake process 69 the biosorption process is greatly affected by factors such as ph adsorbent dose temperature metal ion concentration ionic strength reaction time and sorbent size therefore it is necessary to study the effects of these parameters on the biosorption capacity some of the commonly occurring biosorption mechanisms occurring during sorption of heavy metals on biosorbents are discussed below 3 2 1 ion exchange ion exchange is one of the most common mechanisms that takes place during the biosorption process this reversible exchange process involves the electrostatic interaction between positively charged metal ions in the solution with the negatively charged ions present on the surface of the biosorbent material typically there are various functional groups and free sites available on the surface of the biosorbent material for this exchange to take place in a study conducted by qu et al 70 the authors used sulphur functionalized rice husk for the removal of cadmium from water the authors reported that the main mechanisms involved were ion exchange and chelation upon conducting edx analysis for both modified and unmodified rice husks it was found that the na i ions increased from 4 33 mg g to 20 55 mg g and mg ii ions had increased from 0 02 mg g to 0 93 mg g after the biosorption process had reached equilibrium which means that ion exchange process would have taken place between the heavy metal ions and the positively charged magnesium and sodium ions in another study feng et al 32 studied the adsorption of copper lead and zinc by using modified orange peel they found that the mechanism of heavy metal uptake by the modified orange peel is based on the ion exchange mechanism between the copper lead zinc ions and the calcium chelated onto the carboxylic groups present in the structure of pectin similarly reddad et al 71 also reported that ion exchange mechanism and chelation were the main mechanisms that took place between pb2 cu2 and zn2 on sugar beet pulp with the calcium ions 3 2 2 complexation functional groups present in the biosorbent have the ability to form complex coordinate bonds with heavy metals ions a complex compound can be defined as a poly atomic molecule that has one or more central atoms surrounded by and attached to ligands 72 for example in a study conducted by harripersadth et al 73 the authors reported that complexation was the main mechanism for the removal of cadmium and lead ions using sugarcane bagasse and eggshells as a biosorbent material the authors explained through ftir analysis that the carboxyl groups present in eggshells form complexes with cadmium and lead ions for sugarcane bagasse ftir analysis confirmed the presence of hydroxyl carbonyl and aromatic rings these functional groups donate an electron pair to be able to form complexes with the metal ions 3 2 3 chelation when a ligand is attached to the central atom through two or more coordinating atoms then the complex is called chelate 72 74 and the chelate formation process is known as chelation biosorbents generally contain ligands that assist the chelation process for example he et al 75 used a lignin based biosorbent derived from corn for the removal and recovery of au iii from aqueous solution the authors reported that the adsorption process took place because au iii ions chelated onto the biosorbent through the nitrogen containing functional groups from polyaniline and oxygen containing functional groups from lignin which was enzymatically hydrolysed following this after a redox reaction between the functional groups and the au iii ions au iii was converted into au 0 3 2 4 micro precipitation in this process an insoluble metal particulate is formed it is another common process that may occur during the adsorption of heavy metals during micro precipitation precipitation takes place on the surface of the biosorbent or within the pores of the adsorbent for example liu et al 76 used water melon rind as a biosorbent to adsorb copper zinc and lead from aqueous solution the mechanisms involved in the adsorption were ion exchange and micro precipitation the sem micrographs and analysis in the study revealed that upon interaction between the biosorbent and the heavy metal the pores on the surface became less as they were occupied by the metal ions the active surface area also increased and was covered by the metal ions that had precipitated panda et al 77 also reported micro precipitation as a mechanism through which cadmium ions were adsorbed on the lathyrus sativus husk 4 adsorption studies 4 1 adsorption isotherms to gain a better understanding on the mechanism of adsorption between the adsorbate and adsorbent various mathematical models known as adsorption isotherms are applied to the system the different types of adsorption isotherms include langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich sips halsey temkin redlich peterson etc 78 84 in table 3 various adsorption studies have been listed along with the best fitting adsorption isotherm model coefficient correlation r2 value experimental conditions such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t initial metal ion concentration co dosage d ph and the calculated maximum adsorption capacity qmax as seen in table 3 most of the studies fit in best with either the langmuir or freundlich isotherm models the conceptual basis of the langmuir isotherm model is that the biosorption takes place in a monolayer surrounding a homogenous solid surface in which there is no contact between the adsorbed species 85 the freundlich isotherm suggests the heterogeneity of the adsorbate 86 the mathematical equations for the langmuir isotherm is as follows 78 1 c e q e c e q m 1 q m k l linear 2 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e non linear in the above equation c e is the aqueous phase adsorbate equilibrium concentration mg l qm is the theoretical maximum monolayer coverage capacities mg g kl is langmuir isotherm constant l mg and qe is the equilibrium adsorption capacity mg g the freundlich isotherm model can be described with the following mathematical equation 79 3 log q e log k f log c e n linear equation 4 q e k f c e 1 n non linear equation in the above equation c e is the concentration of metal ions at equilibrium mg l qe is the mass of metal ions adsorbed at equilibrium mg g kf is the adsorption capacity constant mg g l mg 1 n n is a constant denoting the degree and favourability of adsorption for instance in a study conducted by edathil et al 87 the authors fitted the adsorption data into the langmuir freundlich dubinin radushkevich and temkin models to study the adsorption of lead ions on a magnetic coffee waste nanocomposite the langmuir isotherm best fitted the experimental data with an r2 value greater than 0 99 this indicates that a monolayer adsorption took place during the adsorption process the maximum adsorption capacity was 41 15 mg g at optimal experimental conditions 4 2 adsorption kinetics in an adsorption process adsorption kinetic studies are used to describe the mechanisms of reaction rate control such as progress of chemical reactions processes and mass transfer these models describe the rate of solute bonding on the surface of the biosorbent the most commonly used kinetic models are pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models these models assume that the rate of sorption is proportional to the number of free sites on the surface of the sorbent in the proper power first or second 50 in table 4 various adsorption studies using agricultural wastes have been listed along with the best fitting kinetic model coefficient correlation r2 value experimental conditions such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t initial metal ion concentration co dosage d ph and equilibrium adsorption capacities qe as seen in table 4 most of the adsorption studies fit best in the pseudo second order kinetic model this means that the adsorption mechanism is mainly dominated by chemisorption the mathematical equation for the pseudo second order kinetics is as follows 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e in this equation qe and qt is the adsorption capacities mg g at equilibrium and time t k2 is the rate constant for second order adsorption gmg 1 min 1 and is determined from the linear plot of t qt versus t for instance owalude and tella 113 studied the adsorption kinetics of hexavalent chromium on modified groundnut hull by studying the uptake of the hexavalent chromium ions at different time intervals and at optimal conditions the experimental data on the effect of contact time on the adsorption of hexavalent chromium ions was fitted in the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models the kinetics data fitted best into the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic model with r2 value of 0 9992 indicating that the governing adsorption mechanism was chemisorption involving valence forces through exchange and or sharing of electrons between the adsorbent and adsorbate 30 5 brief overview of chemical modifications of biosorbents for the removal of heavy metals 5 1 chemical modifications of agricultural wastes depending on the genetic makeup of agricultural wastes the adsorption capacity may not be high because of low mechanical strength or lack of preferential active sites for adsorption moreover in some cases raw biosorbents may contain substance that may block functional groups present on the surface and thereby hinder biosorption leading to reduced adsorption capacity 140 therefore over the years researchers have been developing ways to enhance adsorption capacity active sites for adsorption mechanical strength and longevity of biosorbents through various physical biological and chemical modifications 141 however chemical modification of biosorbents often takes precedence over other forms of treatment due to its simplicity and efficiency 142 chemical modifications can change the biosorbent behaviour in terms their ability to participate in ion exchange their hydrophobicity hydrophilicity the elasticity and thermal resistance 67 generally prior to performing chemical modifications the biosorbent undergoes various steps such as washing drying crushing grinding and sieving 95 127 143 a list of such modifications conducted on various agriculture waste based biosorbents are presented in table 5 after achieving the desired size various types of modifying agents as mentioned in fig 2 including acids bases and organic compounds are used for chemical pre treatment by treating the biosorbent surface with acids and bases the surface gets oxidized and forms functional groups that can overall enhance the sorption capacity 144 other methods such as biosorbent immobilization which include crosslinking of polymers are also used graft polymerization is another method in which long polymer chains such as acrylic acid acrylamide acrylonitrile hydroxylamine and glycidyl monomers are introduced on the biosorbent backbone to enhance biosorption 57 5 1 1 biosorbent composites in synthesizing a biosorbent composite generally two or more selected materials are combined together to create a composite with improved properties 149 biosorbents can also be combined with other organic compounds or metal oxides to achieve better biosorbent properties 144 some examples of composite materials that can be incorporated in biosorbents are nano3 polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl chloride dimethylamine metal salts such as iron salt copper salts zinc salts etc 150 152 among composite materials metal oxide salts have been of great interest to researchers and has been explored extensively this is because metal oxide salts can be used to produce magnetized particles which can then produce enhanced biosorbents with magnetic properties that can be separated and reused easily the combination with metal oxide salts can significantly enhance the biosorption capacity 153 154 magnetic biosorbents are generally prepared by treating the biosorbent material with metallic salts such as iron chloride hexahydrate iron sulphate heptahydrate manganese oxide tetrahydrate and manganese sulphate hydrate 155 when choosing a biosorbent for heavy metal removal the ability of the adsorbent to be separated from the adsorbate is one of the most crucial criteria otherwise there will be secondary pollution which will also increase the cost of the operation and maintenance magnetic biosorbents can be easily separated under the influence of an external magnetic field 24 in adsorption processes smaller sized magnetic materials have advantages due to their high surface area volume ratio magnetic nanoparticles fall under the particle size of 100 nm and are single domain particles exhibiting a superparamagnetic behaviour 156 in the absence of an external magnetic field these magnetic nanoparticles have zero magnetization no coercivity and are less likely to agglomerate 157 these consequences of the superparamagnetic behaviour make them favourable for adsorption processes the main mechanisms of sorption by magnetic biosorbents are ion exchange electrostatic interaction precipitation and complexation magnetic biosorbents can contribute towards ion exchange through their metal based functional groups 158 they can also contribute to redox reactions due to their surface charge 65 most of the biosorbents are diamagnetic in nature which is why they need to be modified by superparamagnetic ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic particles to become magnetically active superparamagnetic magnetic iron oxide particles that are commonly used are magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite fe2o3 polysaccharide biopolymers such as cellulosic material are commonly used for magnetic modification due to their ability to improve and tune the chemical affinity towards specific heavy metals in wastewater there are various methods to prepare magnetic biosorbents such as co precipitation reactions in microemulsions hydrothermal reactions sol gel syntheses reactions hydrolysis and thermolysis of precursors mechanochemical processes and microwave synthesis co precipitation is more commonly used to prepare magnetic biosorbents 159 160 5 2 studies on chemical modification of biosorbents in this section various agricultural waste based adsorbents have been discussed focusing on their chemical modification adsorption mechanisms and functional groups involved in the uptake of heavy metals factors affecting biosorption such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t initial metal ion concentration co dosage d and ph are also discussed the mechanisms and functional groups involved in various adsorbents is listed in table 6 whereas the data on modifying agents and the adsorbents performance is listed in table 7 5 2 1 chemical modification of biosorbents using metal and inorganic salts it has been reported that biosorption efficiency can be enhanced by using metal salts and inorganic salts moreover metal and inorganic salts do not cause a mass loss in the biosorbents like acids or bases do in a study conducted by guo et al 33 the authors modified orange peels with kcl to study the removal of cu2 cd2 pb2 zn2 and ni2 from aqueous solution orange peels constitutes of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin which form carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups that are efficient in heavy metal uptake 124 modification using kcl can be used to initiate an ion exchange reaction between h of carboxylic acid present on the orange peel surface and the na mg2 or k ions to increase ion exchange capability 123 in this study adsorption equilibrium was attained after 20 min the adsorption followed a pseudo second order kinetics indicating that the adsorption took place through chemisorption the study also included adsorption experiments in a single and binary metal system to study the effects of competing ions the results showed that adsorption was equally efficient in both the systems it has been reported that zncl2 can improve mesopores specific surface area and micropores of a biosorbent 59 158 pei and liu 118 modified grapefruit peel by using zncl2 as an activating agent for the removal of lead ions from aqueous solution upon investigation the authors concluded that the sorption occurred through chemisorption ion exchange between lead ions and biosorbent surface had taken place introduction of negatively charged cl groups could also participate in metal binding the biosorbent surface consists of oxygen rich functional groups which will interact with the lead ions and undergo chemical adsorption after that the lead ions will accumulate on the surface of the biosorbent by means of physical adsorption from these case studies it is evident that when a metal or organic salt is used for modifying a biosorbent it promotes an ion exchange reaction between the heavy metal and the modified biosorbent surface similarly in a study conducted by mohamed et al 169 the authors modified banana peel with koh for the removal of pb2 and fe2 ions the results demonstrated that the maximum removal efficiency reached 100 and 64 respectively it was reported that the addition of koh to the untreated banana peel hydrolysed the peel and promoted the formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups increasing the amount of koh created stronger and broader peaks when analysed therefore treating the samples with koh increased the oxygen containing functional groups the main adsorption mechanisms were expected to be ion exchange and surface complexation with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups 5 2 2 chemical modification of biosorbents using bases it has been reported that alkali treatment of biosorbents can increase the porosity of a biosorbent and incorporate new functional groups which can participate in biosorption through mechanisms such as ion exchange 144 calcium hydroxide is commonly used saponifying agent used to modify biosorbents to improve the uptake of heavy metals 128 it has been reported that calcium hydroxide causes a crosslinking reaction with the molecules of the biosorbent 187 in a study conducted by peng et al 124 orange peel modified with ca oh 2 was used to study the removal arsenic from aqueous solution in this study the surface morphology was analysed through sem analysis the sem images after chemical modification depicted a heterogeneous surface which was favourable for arsenic adsorption it was reported that as v exists mainly as h2aso4 between a ph range of 3 and 6 therefore in this study adsorption could have taken place due to the substitution of cooh oh groups with the ions of h2aso4 present on the surface of the biosorbent 188 furthermore the ftir spectra confirmed the presence of metal binding functional groups such as carboxylic groups and hydroxyl group nh oh band at 3427 93 cm 1 1649 61 cm 1 and 1033 23 cm 1 cn band at 1242 20 cm 1 co band at ch band at 2927 44 cm 1 that would participate in ionization and the removal of arsenic similarly muskmelon peel was modified with ca oh 2 and used as a biosorbent for the removal of pb2 by huang and zhu 116 muskmelon peel consists of protein cellulose and polysaccharides such as pectic acid these functional groups are associated with metal binding functional groups such as cooh and oh about 10 of the muskmelon peel consists of pectic acid dry weight pectic acid is also the source of functional ligands which can participate in the uptake of lead ions after modification with ca oh 2 the pectic acid will be converted to pectic calcium and participate in forming bonds with the positively charged lead ions cationic exchange between the ca2 and pb2 is the main biosorption mechanism in this study similar cation exchange mechanism was reported by feng and guo 32 when the authors used sodium hydroxide and calcium chloride to modify orange peel for the removal of cu2 pb2 and zn2 sem analysis conducted in this study revealed that after modification with sodium hydroxide and calcium chloride the biosorbent surface showed more irregularities and pores the surface area was analysed by bet method and the results showed that modified orange peel had a surface area of 1 496 m2 g and the unmodified orange peel had a surface area of 0 828 m2 g denoting that the surface area had increased after chemical modification increase in surface area means that there will be more active sites available for heavy metal adsorption the metal uptake process reached equilibrium very quickly within 10 min the adsorption capacity increased after modification from 44 28 mg g to 70 73 mg g for cu2 113 5 mg g to 208 9 mg g for pb2 and 21 25 mg g to 56 18 mg g for zn2 the modified adsorbent also showed high selectivity towards pb2 and zn2 the adsorption capacities metals adsorbed per gram of biosorbent as achieved by the biosorbents were analysed in terms of the ca2 ions remaining inside the aqueous solution it was evident that ion exchange process took place between the cationic metal ions and ca2 the mechanism of adsorption can be described as ion exchange between the heavy metal ions and calcium ions chelated to the carboxylic groups on the polymeric structure of pectin in the adsorbent additionally modifying a biosorbent with a base can increase the negative charge on the surface of the biosorbent and increase the electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged biosorbent surface and the cationic heavy metals ions similarly ayob et al 179 also modified pineapple waste using naoh for the removal of lead form aqueous solution the adsorption efficiency increased from 52 57 to 85 88 after modification this was because after treating the pineapple waste with naoh the adsorbent is expected to undergo deprotonation the na ions in the naoh are more electropositive than pb2 which allows a displacement reaction between the sodium and lead ions additionally ion exchange between the lead ions and the carboxylate and hydroxyl anionic groups present on the adsorbent surface can occur 5 2 3 chemical modification of biosorbents with acids modification of biosorbents with acids helps to remove impurities and unwanted compounds from the biosorbents surface there have been various studies in which the biosorption efficiency was improved by using acids as modifying agents according to horsfall et al 189 mercaptoacetic acid causes thiolation incorporation of sulfhydryl groups of the oh functional groups that are abundantly available on cellulose backbone there have been various studies in which researchers have modified agricultural wastes using mercaptoacetic acid in a study conducted by liang et al 91 the authors used orange peels modified with mercaptoacetic acid for the removal of pb2 and zn2 from aqueous solution ftir analysis confirmed that hydroxyl carboxyl and mercapto groups were responsible for the adsorption the modified orange peel can adsorb heavy metal ions through cation exchange complexation or even through a combination of both the processes in the reaction mechanism functional groups such as oh sh and cooh will release h ions into the aqueous solution and the heavy metal ions will be adsorbed on the active sites of the biosorbent the authors noticed a significant improvement from 90 mg g to 164 mg g for pb2 and 25 to 80 mg g for zn2 after modification with mercaptoacetic acid ion exchange is a predominant biosorption mechanism that takes place between heavy metal ions and functional groups for example lasheen et al 89 used acid treatment to modify orange peel by protonation with hno3 to study the removal of cd2 cu2 and pb2 from aqueous solution soaking the orange peel in hno3 followed by rinsing and drying unnecessary components that would block the active sites thereby exposing them for adsorption to take place protonation of the biosorbent also reduces the competition between ions such as ca2 and k so that metal ions can bind the available active sites the ftir spectra analysis revealed a change in bonding pattern of the carboxylate group present in pectin which indicates its involvement in the biosorption process similar results were observed by fu and wang 15 suyono et al 96 also used hno3 to modify petai peels and papaya leaves for the removal of pb2 ions from aqueous solution ftir analysis revealed that the dominant functional groups participating in adsorption present on petai peels and papaya leaves were the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups nitric acid also has the ability to increase the acidic groups on the surface of the biosorbent by reacting with the functional groups that are basic in nature to produce more acidic functional groups through heterocyclic opening 190 petai peel followed langmuir isotherm indicating a homogenous monolayer adsorption whereas papaya peels followed freundlich isotherm indicating multilayer adsorption before adsorption sem analysis showed a porous biosorbent surface after adsorption took place these pores were smaller which indicates the accumulation of the heavy metals ions in the pores in another study conducted by burevska et al 100 hno3 was used to modify peanut husks for the removal of ni2 ions sem analysis of the peanut husk before chemical modification depicted a rough surface with numerous pores and cavities after chemical modification new cavities and pores were spotted this improved the structure of the biosorbent and contributed to the increase in the specific surface area and increased the biosorption capacity the adsorption isotherm studies revealed that peanut husks modified with hno3 showed better adsorption capacity when compared to natural peanut husk as reported by nguyen et al 191 oxygen and nitrogen content increases with nitric acid treatment whereas carbon content reduces this could be due to 1 more number oxygen containing functional groups involving phenolic carboxylic and nitro moieties on the surface and 2 due to more number of no3 and no2 groups resulting from nitric acid therefore oxidation via nitric acid could increase the biosorption ability of a biosorbent in various studies biosorbents modified by citric acid have produced carboxylic acid sites that have contributed to increasing the adsorption capacity 192 citric acid modification has been reported to increase cationic exchange properties of the biosorbent 193 in a study conducted by liu et al 102 the authors modified sugarcane bagasse with citric acid and fe3o4 for the removal of cd2 and pb2 from aqueous solution citric acid is known to be a chelator that can combine itself with heavy metal ions such as cd cu and pb to limit their mobilization also esterification between hydroxyl groups and citric acid can produce more functional groups and active sites on the surface of the biosorbent the sugarcane bagasse showed higher removal capacity after chemical modification the biosorption was found to be mainly due to the oxygen containing functional groups such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups ftir analysis indicated the occurrence of complexation with the carbonyl groups it also revealed that a number of carboxylic groups also participated in the adsorption by sharing oxygen electrons with the cd2 and pb2 ions similar analysis has been reported by vaughan et al 192 it was reported that in an esterification reaction when a citric acid molecule is attached to the cellulose of a corncob each citric acid molecule attached produced an additional two carboxylic acid groups for biosorption and thereby increased the adsorption capacity it was reported by özer et al 194 that chemical treatment with acids such as h2so4 can convert macropores into micropores this can cause a change in the surface area h2so4 also removed potassium and chlorine from the surface of the biosorbent after removing these groups carbon oxygen and sulphur groups were left on the surface these groups are expected to engage in biosorption similarly martín lara et al 105 also used h2so4 to modify sugarcane bagasse for the removal of lead ions from aqueous solution chemical modification with h2so4 produced more negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylic acid the treatment is also expected to cause an increase in the surface area and oxidize the functional groups present on the biosorbent to carboxylic groups which will enhance biosorption carboxylic acid is expected to increase the biosorption of lead ions amine groups were also found at a ph of 10 and could have contributed towards the biosorption the adsorption capacity before and after biosorption increased from 6 366 mg g to 7 297 mg g in a study conducted by ahmad et al 195 pineapple fruit peel was modified by oxidizing it with h2so4 and kmno4 to study the removal of cd2 and pb2 from aqueous solution the authors reported that the chemical modification greatly enhanced the biosorption capacity the biosorption capacity for both the metal ions was higher for the modified pineapple peel it was hypothesized that biosorption may have taken place through chelation electrostatic attraction between the anionic ligands i e coo oh and the metal ions while the carboxyl hydroxyl groups undergoes deprotonation at a ph range of 3 4 moreover adsorption isotherm studies revealed that the data fit best with the langmuir isotherm which implies that the process was a homogenous and monolayer adsorption the biosorption of cd2 was seen to be significantly higher than pb2 this was attributed to pb2 having a larger atomic radii of 1 20 å in comparison to cd2 that has an atomic radii of 0 97 å which causes steric hindrance in another study conducted by hemavathy et al 170 the authors modified cassia fistula seeds with hcl and h2so4 to remove lead ions from aqueous solution cassia fistula seeds modified with h2so4 showed the highest adsorption capacity it was reported that the presence of alcohol sulphates and phosphates on the surface of the adsorbent could promote hydrogen bonding with the lead ions the lead ions were adsorbed through hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces between the lead ions and the adsorbent surface 5 2 4 chemical modification of biosorbents by graft polymerization another method of chemical modification is graft polymerization in this process a side chains made up of monomers are covalently bonded and polymerized on the cellulosic backbone forming a copolymer this process can improve the metal binding capacity of a biosorbent for example in a study conducted by ali et al 85 it was reported that by grafting acrylonitrile side chain onto the cellulosic skeleton of banana peels there was a significant improvement in the uptake of cr vi from ions from aqueous solution due to the enhancement in the metal biosorbent interaction sem analysis revealed that the unmodified banana peels had lignin pectin and other viscous components the modified banana peel depicted that the viscous components were removed thereby revealing more pores and an uneven surface after adsorption the surface looked smoother due to the filling up of pores with heavy metals the adsorption followed the langmuir isotherm model which indicates that the uptake process is a monolayer adsorption thermodynamic studies revealed that the process is exothermic feasible and spontaneous similarly in another study conducted by feng et al 88 the authors chemically modified orange peel by hydrolysing the grafted copolymer which was synthesised by interacting methyl acrylate with cross linking orange peel to remove pb2 cd2 ni2 ions from aqueous solution the maximum adsorption capacities by modified orange peel for pb2 cd2 and ni2 ions were 476 1 293 3 and 162 6 mg g when compared to the unmodified orange peels the adsorption capacities were 4 2 4 6 and 16 5 fold for pb2 cd2 and ni2 respectively an equilibrium was reached within 150 min at 30 c ftir spectrum of the biosorbent depicted that carboxyl and hydroxyl groups were present in abundance and would have assisted in adsorption of the metal ions onto the biosorbent surface overall the adsorption capacity increased significantly by grafting methyl acrylate on orange peel this can be attributed to the introduction of additional carboxyl groups on the adsorbent surface 5 2 5 comparative studies of chemically modified biosorbents using various modifying agents the effect of chemical modification on the sorption efficiency depends on many factors such as the type of modifying agent nature of the biosorbent material itself and the type of the ions being adsorbed 196 197 therefore the outcome of chemical modification will be different for each type of biosorbent in a study conducted by villen guzman et al 94 various modifying agents such as hno3 hcl h3po4 cacl2 nh3 and naoh were used to modify lemon peel for the removal of ni2 from aqueous solution the effect of each modifying agent was studied surface treatment with naoh showed the best results it has been previously reported that chemical modification using alkaline treatments such as naoh treatment increases the number of carboxylate ligands for the metal binding sites allowing enhanced adsorption 198 villen guzman et al 94 reported that the biosorption of nickel ions reached 100 with an adsorbent dose of 5 g l the pectin cellulose and pigments present in lemon peel consists of various functional groups such as carboxyl group hydroxyl group and alkyl groups ftir analysis confirmed that after nickel ions were adsorbed on the lemon peel there was a reduction in the peak intensities of the co and co due to the adsorption moreover the peak intensities associated with alkyl groups were reduced indicating the involvement of these groups in the biosorption process these functional groups promote metal binding as depicted in fig 3 sem micrographs showed that after modification with naoh even though there was some alteration in the surface structure the superficial structure was maintained the change in surface irregularities could have contributed to the improved adsorption of nickel ions it was explained that the increase in adsorption capacity of the naoh treated adsorbent was due to the conversion of the lignin structure into a negatively charged surface which will strongly attract positively charged heavy metal ions naoh modification may have also caused the metal hydroxides to micro precipitate thereby increasing adsorption in another study conducted by mahmood ul hassan et al 199 the authors reported that chemical modification of banana stalks corn cob and sunflower achene with naoh gave the best adsorption results when compared to modifications using nitric acid and sulfuric acid for the removal of cd2 cr2 and pb2 the chemical treatment is expected to have facilated the hydrolysis of the hemicellulose with the acid alkali chen et al 200 explained that during hydrolysis monomeric sugars and soluble oligomers are released from the cell wall matrix into the hydrolysate thereby increasing the porosity and the heavy metal sorption capacity low et al 201 and mahmood ul hassan et al 199 also explained that treatment with naoh increases the galacturonic acid groups after hydrolysis of o methyl ester groups and increases metal sorption in another study conducted by massocatto et al 30 naoh modified banana peel showed better adsorption results when compared with hcl and h3po4 for the removal of pb2 from aqueous solution the naoh modified banana peel had the maximum biosorption capacity of 90 mg g and followed the freundlich adsorption isotherm it was also proved through desorption studies that the naoh modified banana peel most efficiently desorbed the lead ions with hcl as the desorbing agent ftir analysis confirmed the presence of hydroxyl carbonyl phosphate and carboxyl groups present on the biomass it also showed the difference in morphological structure before and after modification according to the peak intensities banana peel modified with hcl gave the most drasticcalteration and suggested the presence of carboxyl anions morphological studies revealed that h3po4 did not alter the surface significantly but there was a notable alteration in the structure of banana peels modified with naoh and hcl the surface showed irregularities in the form of lamellar pore channel which may be attributed to the hydrolysis reaction of carbohydrates and fibers banana peel modified with naoh also portrayed a rougher surface which is favourable for adsorption shuhaimen et al 145 studied removal of copper ions from aqueous solution by papaya peels modified with naoh and concluded that the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the papaya peel were involved in the adsorption of copper ions there were studies in which acid treatment showed better results when compared to other base treatments for example in a study performed by santos et al 104 the authors investigated the effect of chemical modification on sugarcane bagasse by citric acid naoh and citric acid with naoh treatment on the removal of lead ions from aqueous solution chemical modification by citric acid showed the best results ftir analysis conducted after chemical modification indicated that carboxylic acid groups were present at a stretching vibration of 1730 cm 1 in another investigation conducted by nuithitikul et al 112 the authors modified cashew nutshell with h2so4 hno3 and naoh to remove pb2 from aqueous solution the authors noticed that the surface area increased significantly after modification with h2so4 the surface area after modification was 0 648 m2 g the pore volume and mean pore diameter also increased after modification modification with h2so4 also showed the best adsorption capacity of 8 30 mg g whereas untreated cashew nutshell showed the lowest adsorption capacity of 2 08 mg g it was reported by esteghlalian et al 202 that pre treating biosorbents with dilute h2so4 can lead to high reaction rates and enhanced cellulosic hydrolysis treatment with h2so4 causes an increase in single o2 bond containing functional groups such as alcohols phenols esters etc this was confirmed through ftir analysis sharp peaks at 1028 1155 and 1207 cm 1 the significant increase in efficiency could be attributed to the co and co bonds formed after modification in this study cashew nutshell modified with hno3 showed the next highest adsorption capacity when compared to naoh modified cashew nutshell hno3 modified cashew nutshell had increased number of actives sites present on the biosorbent surface according to the results of ftir analysis also the pore volume and specific surface area were found to be greater than naoh treated cashew shell 5 2 6 chemical modification of biosorbents using magnetic particles magnetic particles and nanoparticles have proven to increase the sorption efficiency of biosorbents moreover due to their magnetic properties they can be easily separated after biosorption has taken place peanut hull is an agricultural waste produced from the shelling process of graded peanuts it was estimated that about 500 000 tonnes of peanut hull biomass are readily available annually due to its abundance and high organic matter it is a good candidate to be transformed into a biosorbent for heavy metals adsorption it has been reported that the peanut body typically consists of proteins polysaccharides and lipids they consist of various metal binding functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amine groups that participate in heavy metal binding 127 203 however to increase the adsorption efficiency and physical characteristics of peanut hull based biosorbents researchers have applied various types of chemical modifications techniques in order to improve the adsorption capacity of biosorbents for example in a study conducted by kucukcongar et al 127 the authors produced a nanocomposite with peanut hull iron ii sulphate and iron iii chloride via co precipitation method to study the removal of ni2 ions ftir analysis confirmed the presence of hydroxyl group on the surface of modified ph fe3o4 at 3324 71 cm 1 and unmodified peanut hull ph at 3303 05 cm 1 however after the biosorption of nickel ions took place the peak of the hydroxyl groups was not present anymore indicating that this group may have been involved in the binding of heavy metals moreover changes in the oh ch co and feo peaks during the analysis proved their participation in the sorption process additionally sem analysis of ph fe3o4 showed the presence of lignin protein cellulose long thin fibers and active zones after adsorption of nickel onto the nanocomposite the number of occupied pores and particles increased when compared to unmodified peanut hull due to the adsorption of nickel ions and presence of iron oxide particles based on the sem edx analysis performed on the ph fe3o4 nanocomposite for elemental analysis it was concluded that the nanocomposite consisted of a high percentage of iron carbon and oxygen the presence of iron oxide was also confirmed through sem edx the percentage of iron oxide increased from 0 21 in peanut hull to 15 94 in ph fe3o4 indicating the effect of ph modification the surface area of the nanocomposite material was analysed through bet method the surface area was found to be 37 44 m2 g in this study the native peanut hull originally consisted of metal binding functional groups further modification of the peanut hull by incorporating magnetic nanoparticles increased the surface area added more actives sites and functional groups to the biosorbent thereby improving the adsorption efficiency similarly lichi peels lp are an abundantly available agricultural waste with great heavy metal biosorption potential due to the presence of functional groups such as amino groups carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups litchi peels have the ability to adsorb heavy metals these functional groups cause the surface of litchi peels to be negatively charged thereby promoting heavy metal uptake it was reported by jiang et al 204 that magnetically modifying lp with fe3o4 nanoparticles mlp enhanced the removal of pb ii from aqueous solution the functional groups of both lp and mlp were analysed through ft ir spectra the adsorption peaks confirmed the presence of hydroxyl amino and carbonyl groups notably the introduction of fe3o4 nanoparticles onto the litchi peels did not alter the active groups present on the biosorbent surface the magnetic litchi peels were of superparamagnetic nature according to the saturation magnetization curve which also confirms the magnetization of the litchi peels isotherm studies resulted in a high correlation coefficient value for both freundlich and langmuir model the adsorption kinetics followed a pseudo second order model with a correlation factor of 0 9999 which indicates that the adsorption took place mainly through chemisorption as depicted in fig 4 separation studies showed that sedimentation after adsorption in the presence of magnetic field occured rapidly thus it can be concluded that the presence of a magnetic field can provide quick and efficient solid liquid separation pengsaket et al 161 investigated the removal of cu2 by using magnetically modified pomelo peel with fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles mnps pp co precipitation method was used to synthesis the mnps pp nanocomposite material by varying different ratios by weight 2 1 2 2 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 the sorption results showed that as the amount of pomelo peel increased in the composite material the sorption of cu2 also increased it was concluded that the mnps pp showed higher adsorption capacity when compared to magnetic nanoparticles by itself among the magnetically modified pomelo peel ratios mnps pp 2 6 achieved maximum adsorption of 8 mg g the adsorption equilibrium was reached at the 20 40 min mark the inner pomelo peel contains polysaccharide that consist of many hydroxyl groups it can be derived that the adsorption process occurred due to the ion exchange between the h present in the hydroxyl group and cu2 ions 5 mfeoh cu2 feo mcu 2 m mh morphological studies of the mnps pp nanocomposite revealed that the adsorption mechanism of cu2 occurred through ion exchange due to the presence of oh functional group on the surface of the biosorbent separation studies were conducted by using an external magnetic field which resulted in easy and quick settling of the cu2 embedded in the mnp pp lópez téllez et al 101 synthesised iron oxide nanorods in orange peels to study the reduction of chromium vi from aqueous solution constituents of orange peel such as cellulose hemicellulose and lignin components are naturally occurring reducing agents these components aid in the formation of iron and or iron oxide nanorods from iron ions the biosorbent had a maximum adsorption capacity of 7 44 mg g which is much higher when compared to adsorption via unmodified orange peel that achieved an adsorption capacity of 1 9 mg g the adsorption mechanism suggested by the authors is a redox reaction between hydroxyl groups and iron ions langmuir isotherm model was found to be the best fit adsorption isotherm this means the adsorption was homogenous and underwent a monolayer formation costa et al 143 investigated the sorption performance of magnetized coconut fiber for the removal of cr vi from aqueous solution at a ph of 2 and all other experimental factors at optimal conditions the sorption capacity of the magnetized coconut fiber and natural coconut fiber was 87 38 mg g and 23 87 mg g respectively the process attained equilibrium within 20 min the magnetized coconut fibers showed a 4 times higher sorption capacity than natural fibers the ph at the point of zero charge was 3 19 for the natural fiber and 3 53 for the magnetized fiber moreover sem analysis revealed that the natural fiber was a porous material with plenty of pores and tubes on the surface of the biosorbent whereas in the case of the magnetized coconut fiber smaller pore diameter was seen there was a decrease in surface porosity as pores were replaced by iron nanoparticles which acted as active sites for sorption the sem images also showed aggregates along the fiber which aided in the increase of the adsorption capacity there was also a decrease in the amorphous nature of the biosorbent after the introduction of crystalline magnetite onto its surface similarly haghighat and ameri 35 also used iron nanoparticles to modify wheat straw ws to synthesise a nano magnetic wheat straw mws biosorbent for the sorption of lead native wheat straw consists of many hydroxyl groups that be chemical reaction sites these sites are where fe3o4 iron particles can be adsorbed and form fe3o4 crystals the ftir spectra confirmed the presence of bonded hydroxyl group at broad peaks at 3346 28 cm 1 in the native wheat straw other peaks on the spectra depicted the carbonyl group stretching from aldehydes and ketones at 1733 86 and 1658 38 cm 1 stretch vibration of co from the hydroxyl group at 1427 cm 1 stretch vibration of co in phenols at 1253 06 cm 1 the co band at 1054 cm 1 depicting the lignin structure of the wheat straw the modified wheat straw showed a maximum biosorption capacity of 50 76 mg g whereas the unmodified wheat straw showed a maximum biosorption capacity of 41 15 mg g the increase in biosorption after modification was attributed to the sorption that occurred on the external surface of the biosorbent by the non porous nano adsorbent present in the modified wheat straw the unmodified wheat straw only had micropores where the heavy metals could be adsorbed most of the biosorption process took place on the external surface thus all the metal binding functional groups were present on the exterior of the biosorbent the msw showed a superparamagnetic behaviour which means that it can be separated easily with application of an external field spent coffee grains consist of materials such as polyhydroxy polyphenol and tannin that can adsorb heavy metals 205 it was reported by edathil et al 87 that modifying coffee waste with fe3o4 nanoparticles via single pot co precipitation enhanced the biosorption capacity of pb2 ions there is a possibility of agglomeration of magnetic nanoparticles may occur but the presence of tannin can prevent this from taking place the modified coffee waste was porous wrinkled and had an entangled fibrous network the structure also showed a slight increase in the heterogeneity of the biosorbent a heterogeneous surface in favourable for biosorption to take place 158 the maximum biosorption capacity obtained was 41 15 mg g at a ph value of 7 3 and temperature of 25 c the ph at the point of zero charge was found to be 3 65 which indicates the surface charge of the biosorbent was negative and deemed favourable for adsorbing the positively charged lead ions 92 upon application of data into the intraparticle diffusion model it was concluded that biosorption took place in 3 stages in the first stage the adsorption rate was due to electrostatic forces between adsorbent surface and the adsorbate the second stage was attributed to intraparticle diffusion where the adsorbate enters the pores of the adsorbent and the third stage is when equilibrium was achieved as a result of reduced number of active sites thermodynamic studies indicated that the process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature according to the above discussion it can be concluded that chemical modification enhances biosorption performance the enhancement usually occurs due to introduction of new or more functional groups on the surface of the biosorbent which will facilitate mechanisms such as ion exchange complexation redox reactions etc removing compounds or groups that block potential active sites on the biosorbent increasing the available surface area for biosorption to take place increasing the porosity and heterogeneity of the surface many researchers used various modifying agents each of which gave different properties and degree of improvement more studies on the interactions between modifying agent and biosorbent will give a better understanding to further improve the biosorption efficiency in an adsorption system 5 3 factors effecting biosorption the biosorption process is greatly dependent on factors such as ph initial metal ion concentration adsorbent dose temperature and contact time and competing metal ions therefore it is necessary to find the optimum conditions for the adsorption process table 8 shows some typical results seen in studies on biosorption using various agricultural waste based biosorbents the following sections will discuss the effect of these factors according to various studies conducted using agricultural wastes based biosorbents 5 3 1 effects of ph on biosorption in an adsorption process the ph value is of great importance as it is the driving force for the exchange of h ions with the heavy metal ions it is an essential factor that helps to determine the state of ionization of functional groups present on the biosorbent surface 121 in table 9 the optimum ph for various agricultural waste based adsorbents along with the maximum adsorption capacities and experimental conditions such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t initial metal concentration co and dosage d are listed in a study conducted by kucukcongar et al 127 the authors found that the removal efficiency of nickel increased from a ph range of 2 6 and remained at a constant value of 78 at a ph value greater 6 at lower ph due to the competition between h ions and ni2 ions there is a reduction in removal percentage whereas at a higher ph deprotonation is the cause of increase in the removal percentage similar trends were noticed by various authors for example sobhanardakani and zandipak 110 studied the effect of ph on modified rice husk to remove ni2 and cd2 ions form aqueous solution the authors reported that in a ph range of 1 4 the percentage removal for ni2 and cd2 increased from 25 to 93 5 and from 16 to 85 respectively the highest adsorption was achieved at a ph value of 4 the increase in sorption on the modified rice husk from ph 1 4 can be attributed to the hydrolysis of the ni2 and cd2 ions at ph values lower than 4 the ni2 and cd2 ions may be competing with the h ions for the available active sites during the adsorption process therefore a low removal percentage is achieved however at a higher ph value due to the low concentration of the h ions there will be no competition with the ni2 and cd2 ions therefore the removal percentage was higher it has been reported in various studies that the maximum biosorption takes place between the ph of 3 6 15 26 110 145 for example shuhaimen et al 145 used modified carica papaya peels for the removal of cu2 ions the results showed that at a lower ph the removal percentage was only 17 the low removal percentage was attributed to functional groups on the biosorbent being in a protonated state which will repel against other species with the same charge there will be competing h ions that will occupy the active sites however at a higher ph deprotonation will occur forming negative charges and thereby attracting the cationic metal ions to form bonds with them the highest removal percentage was 75 at a ph value of 3 in another study by feng et al 88 the optimum ph was found to be in the range of 3 6 the authors varied the ph of the solution from 2 to 7 for the adsorption of pb2 cd2 and ni2 ions from aqueous solution on modified orange peel the authors found that the lowest adsorption occurred at a ph value of 2 and increased as the ph increased up to a value of 5 5 the decrease in sorption was attributed to the presence of competing h ions at lower ph at a higher ph the availability of larger number of ligands bearing negative charge will favour the adsorption of metal cations similarly the optimum ph was 4 in a study conducted by panneerselvam et al 132 in which the authors investigated the removal of ni2 ions using magnetically modified tea waste when the authors increased the ph from 2 to 4 the adsorption capacity increased at a ph value greater than 4 the adsorption capacity stayed constant ay et al 135 also reported an optimum ph of 5 when the authors used apple juice residue to remove lead ions from aqueous solution on varying the ph of the solution the authors saw low biosorption at ph levels of 1 5 2 5 the effect of ph on the biosorption process can also be studied in terms of ph at the point of zero charge phpzc 121 for example haghighat and ameri 35 reported that during a study conducted to adsorb lead ions on nano magnetic wheat straw the adsorption capacity reduced as the ph decreased this was attributed to clash between the competitive h ions and pb ii ions for adsorption on the active sites or functional groups the ph at the point of zero charge was found to be 2 1 and 2 6 for wheat straw and modified wheat straw respectively therefore it can be concluded that the surface of the modified biosorbent adsorbent was positively charged at ph 2 6 the adsorption of cations is known to be best at a ph value great than the ph at the point of zero charge which explains the increase in adsorption capacity above a ph value of 2 1 and 2 6 also the increase in ph value may have led to a more negatively charged adsorbent surface which favours adsorption it was reported by jiang et al 204 that at a ph higher than the ph at the point of zero charge higher adsorption capacity was achieved the authors found that the optimum ph for adsorption of pb2 ions by magnetic litchi peels was 6 above which pb oh 2 would form cationic species are favourably adsorbed at a ph greater than the ph at the point of zero charge and vice versa therefore the authors concluded that a ph of 6 would give the best results in general in most adsorption studies the optimal ph value was 3 6 5 3 2 effects of biosorbent dose or mass an increase in biosorbent dosage or mass can decrease the biosorption capacity due to reduced surface area agglomeration of particles electrostatic interactions less mixing inaccessibility to solute and lack of active sites 31 121 206 in table 10 the optimal adsorbent dosage d maximum adsorption capacities and experimental conditions such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t initial metal concentration co and ph are listed for example rosales et al 117 varied the biosorbent mass from 0 3 1 5 g for the removal of hexavalent chromium at an initial concentration of 35 mg l the maximum percentage removal of chromium vi was 99 5 at a biosorbent mass of 1 g the authors reported that an increase in removal efficiency up to 1 g could be due to the availability of large number of active sites on the surface of the biosorbent however the decrease in removal efficiency from 1 to 1 5 g biosorbent mass could be due to the partial aggregation of the biosorbent in another study kucukcongar et al 127 reported that upon increasing the dosage of magnetic peanut hull for the removal of nickel ions there was an increase in removal percentage but there was a decrease in adsorption capacity similarly basu et al 120 also reported comparable results when they increased the dose of cucumber peel biosorbent for the removal of cadmium they reported that at a higher dosage of the biosorbent the percentage removal increased until a certain amount after which the percentage removal decreased due to the presence of excessive active sites in comparison to the amount of heavy metal ions it could also be attributed to the electrostatic forces among the adsorbent cells and due to the interference in between the active sites of the biosorbent jiang et al 204 also noticed similar results and concluded that a litchi peel dose of 5 g l was the optimum dosage for the removal of pb2 at a higher dose the removal efficiency decreased because the adsorbent formed aggregates and also because of the reduction in available surface area for adsorption on the contrary sobhanardakani and zandipak 110 increased the mass of modified rice husk from 0 08 to 0 3 g for the removal of ni2 and cd2 ions the results of their study showed that there was an increase in removal percentage from 50 to 93 5 for ni2 and 33 5 to 85 5 for cd2 the authors attributed the increase in the removal percentage to the availability of larger number of active sites and increase in surface area similarly another study conducted by abbaszadeh et al 207 the authors varied the mass of magnetically modified papaya peel waste that was used to remove pb2 ions from aqueous solution it was found that the adsorption efficiency increased upon increasing the mass of the biosorbent from 10 to 50 mg due to the availability of active sites but there were no significant changes in the adsorption efficiency from 50 to 200 mg the lack of any further increase in adsorption efficiency could be due to the system reaching equilibrium 97 5 3 3 effect of initial metal ion concentration initial metal ion concentration is another factor that can influence the biosorption capacity of a biosorbent many studies have reported that low initial metal ion concentration gives higher biosorption capacity in table 11 the optimum initial metal ion concentration co for various agriculture waste biosorbents along with their maximum adsorption capacities and experimental conditions such as contact time ct equilibrium contact time te temperature t dosage d and ph are listed for example a study was conducted by kucukcongar et al 127 in which the authors varied the concentration of nickel from 10 to 100 mg l to investigate its effect on the adsorption efficiency of magnetically modified peanut hull it was seen that the removal efficiency decreased with the increase in metal concentration the removal efficiency at 10 mg l and 100 mg l was 82 8 and 32 6 respectively this could be attributed to the lack of active sites available for the nickel ions when the metal concentration is increased at a lower initial metal concentration the ratio of available active sites to the heavy metal is large whereas at a high initial metal ion concertation this ratio is low because most of the active sites are saturated therefore low biosorption efficiency would be expected 203 208 a similar trend was observed by haghighat and ameri 35 when they studied the effect of pb2 concentration on the removal efficiency of modified and unmodified wheat straw the results showed that at a lower metal ion concentration the removal efficiency was higher the authors varied the lead concentration from 10 to 1000 mg l they found that at a low concentration of 10 mg l the removal efficiency of modified and unmodified wheat straw was 89 3 and 88 respectively at a lead concentration of 1000 mg l the removal percentages were reduced to 18 9 for modified wheat straw and 16 for unmodified wheat straw this could be because the adsorption of lead occurred at higher energy sites when the concentration of lead was low on the other hand when the concentration of lead is high adsorption may occur on lower energy sites an increase in metal concentration also results in the decrease of initial rate of external diffusion and an increase in intra particles which could reduce the biosorption capacity 97 sharma and bhalerao 209 also noticed similar results when they varied cr vi concentrations to investigate the removal efficiency by banana peels the authors varied the metal concentration from 5 to 250 mg l and found that the removal efficiency decreased upon increasing the metal concentration shakoor et al 134 varied as iii and as v concentrations to investigate its effect on the adsorption capacity of modified watermelon rind the authors reported that the maximum adsorption took place at a concentration of 4 5 mg l and any further increase in concentration did not enhance the adsorption capacity similarly ratan et al 129 varied nickel concentration from 0 to 60 mg l to study its effect on removal efficiency by modified coconut coir pith the authors noticed a decrease in removal efficiency with the increase in initial metal concentration this could be because at lower efficiencies plenty of unoccupied active sites are available for biosorption to take place 198 5 3 4 effect of temperature temperature in a biosorption process plays a crucial role in the uptake of heavy metals in table 12 optimal temperature t maximum removal capacities thermodynamic parameters and experimental conditions such as contact time ct dosage d and ph are listed for various agriculture based adsorbents are listed factors such as enthalpy δh entropy δs gibbs free energy δg are able to describe the enthalpy change randomness and spontaneity of the system the enthalpy can determine if the process is endothermic or exothermic for example a study was conducted to adsorb cadmium and lead on spent grain 201 upon increasing the temperature adsorption of lead and cadmium on spent grain increased when the temperature was increased from 15 c to 55 c the sorption of cadmium increased from 14 21 mg g to 16 20 mg g whereas as the sorption of lead increased from 27 8 mg g to 36 68 mg g the δh value was found to be 34 36 kj mol and 14 12 kj mol for lead and cadmium respectively this explains that the process was endothermic in nature in another study the adsorption of hexavalent chromium on modified groundnut hull was studied by increasing the temperature from 30 to 60 c the results revealed that the adsorption capacity decreased as the temperature increased from 30 to 60 c this indicates that the process was an exothermic process 113 similarly qu et al 70 saw a decrease in sorption with an increase in temperature indicating that the process was exothermic it was reported by joshi et al 131 that increasing the temperature enhanced the diffusion and interaction between metal ions and the active sites on the biosorbent the authors saw an increase in cd2 and pb2 sorption on sio2 teawaste nanocomposites when the temperature was increased from 30 c to 50 c the sorption percentage of cd2 increased from 95 2 to 99 7 and the sorption percentage of pb2 increased from 89 8 to 95 7 similar results were obtained in a study conducted by sharma and bhalerao 209 in which the authors investigated the effect of cr vi sorption on banana peels by increasing the temperature from 20 c to 40 c the removal of cr vi increased from 41 69 to 49 69 upon increasing the temperature and the δh value was found to be positive the process was endothermic in nature moreover the δg value was found to be negative and low which means that the driving force was high and could explain the higher biosorption value 5 3 5 effect of contact time in various studies it was reported that biosorption of heavy metals takes place very quick at the initial stages of the process this is generally due to abundance of available active sites for the heavy metals to bind to in table 13 the optimum contact time for various agriculture waste based biosorbents has been listed along with the maximum removal capacities and experimental conditions such as adsorbent dosage d temperature t initial metal ion concentration co and ph for example owalude and tella 113 reported rapid percentage removal of hexavalent chromium by modified groundnut hull in the first 30 min this was attributed to the large surface area available for adsorption of hexavalent chromium in the first 30 min however the authors did not notice any significant increase in adsorption capacity after 30 min process equilibrium was attained in 80 min when all the available active sites were saturated by metal ions in another study by pei and liu 118 the authors reported that the adsorption of lead ions on grapefruit peel increased with increase in contact time it was stated that in pectin rich fruits the time taken to reach equilibrium is rapid 210 the biosorption in this study was quick and equilibrium was reached in 1 5 h this was due to larger number of available active sites during the initial stages of biosorption jiang et al 204 also reported similar results when the authors varied the contact time from 5 to 20 min to remove pb2 using modified litchi peels the sorption was seen to increase from 88 to 93 the maximum sorption was seen at 120 min the same conclusion was drawn by ratan et al 129 when the authors noticed that sorption of nickel ions on modified coconut coir pith increased with the increase in contact time due to the availability of active sites for adsorption equilibrium was attained at 2 h similarly sharma and bhalerao 209 described that sorption of cr vi on banana peels increased with increase in contact time 5 4 desorption and reusability of biosorbents the two most important deciding factors on the practical applicability of a biosorbent are its adsorption capacity and its ability to be regenerated from an economic standpoint the reusability of spent biosorbents is a major criterion for its selection to be used at an industrial scale 211 various adsorption desorption a d studies are listed in table 14 along with the desorbing agent used removal percentage capacity after desorption and recovery percentage of heavy metals the regeneration process involves the separation of the pollutants from the biosorbent after removal ideally the biosorbent will be able to maintain its morphological structure as well as its adsorption efficiency the biosorbent should be used for a number of cycles before being replaced to reduce cost and reduce further environmental pollution commonly used desorbing agents include organic acids mineral acids alkalis base metallic salts solvents and complexing agents 149 212 acid solutions are typically useful for desorbing most of the metallic ions due to the introduction of h ions which decreases the ph and protonates the oxygen groups present on the surface of the biosorbent 213 the h or h3o ions will be in competition with the heavy metal ions present on the active sites of the adsorbent and the acid radical ions form complexes with heavy metals thereby desorbing the heavy metals a few examples of commonly used acid based eluents are hydrochloric acid nitric acid and sulphuric acid some widely used alkali bases are sodium hydroxide potassium hydroxide and sodium carbonate 212 complexing agents also effectively remove heavy metals by forming stable complexes with the heavy metals on active sites of the adsorbent surface 214 metallic salts desorb heavy metals through ion exchange process 196 215 an ideal desorbing agent is one that is cost effective environmentally friendly is easily separable from the biosorbent and has a high affinity towards the biosorbent the desorption process can be conducted in a batch or column process generally it would be more ideal for the process to take place in a packed column where the eluent is able to flow through the column 149 hcl is a commonly used desorbing agent due to its ability to protonate the surface of the biosorbent and facilitate desorption it has been used in various studies for desorbing heavy metals from biosorbents 119 121 138 for example owalude and tella 113 used 0 01 0 1 1 0 and 1 20 m hcl solution to desorb chromium vi adsorbed onto modified groundnut hull the authors were able to desorb 68 of chromium upon contact with 0 3 m hcl the solution was filtered to recover the biosorbent and then heated at 80 c for 24 h in an oven after biosorbent recovery it was reused up to at least 3 cycles another desorption study using hcl was conducted by lasheen et al 89 in which the authors investigated the desorption pb2 from modified orange peels the spent orange peel was treated with 0 2 m hcl to convert it into hydrogen form for superior adsorption adsorption desorption cycles showed that the removal percentage for pb2 was more than 96 for the first cycle and was between 93 5 and 91 5 in the second fourth cycle the adsorption did not significantly decrease even after four cycles in a study conducted by villen guzman et al 94 the removal efficiency of ni2 from modified lemon peel remained high up to 90 even after 5 adsorption desorption cycle using hno3 and h2so4 as the desorbing agents guo et al 33 also used 0 1 m hcl to recover cu2 cd2 pb2 zn2 and ni2 from modified orange peel even after 10 adsorption desorption cycles the removal efficiency remained high for cu2 cd2 and pb2 at 97 90 and 99 respectively however zn2 and ni2 showed a significant decrease of 78 and 75 respectively after 10 cycles this may be due to the saturation of active sites on the adsorbent surface similarly liu et al 102 used 0 01 m hcl to desorb cd2 and pb2 ions from modified sugarcane bagasse when the 3 cycles of adsorption desorption of modified and unmodified sugarcane bagasse were compared the modified sugarcane bagasse shows higher removal rates the removal rate of cd2 was 31 9 higher for modified sugarcane bagasse and 43 higher for pb2 the citric acid and fe3o4 aided in the strengthening of the biosorbent as well as creating more active sites for adsorption in various studies the authors used multiple desorbing agents to find out the optimum one for example abbaszadeh et al 207 used desorbing agents such as h2so4 hno3 and hcl to find the most suitable desorbing agent for desorbing lead ions from magnetically modified papaya peel waste it was found that maximum desorption of pb2 ions was achieved after shaking for 2 min hcl 0 1 mol l with a volume of 3 ml yielded the best desorption the adsorbent was further washed using hcl 0 1 mol l and deionized water to test reusability the adsorbent could be reused for up to 10 cycles with a reusability efficiency greater than 84 ahmad et al 195 also carried out desorption studies using hcl 0 1 m h2so4 0 1 m and hno3 0 1 m to desorb pb2 and cd2 ions from chemically oxidized pineapple peel similar to the results obtained by abbaszadeh et al 207 hcl 0 1 m was the most efficient and desorbed 90 of cd2 and 87 of pb2 another comparative study to find the best desorbing agent was conducted by kucukcongar et al 127 where the authors used 0 1 n hcl and 0 5 n hno3 to recover ni2 ions from magnetic peanut hull waste during the second adsorption cycle after the desorption results showed a significant decrease in the adsorption the removal efficiency was 27 4 for 0 1 n hcl and 30 2 for 0 5 n hno3 the decrease in the removal efficiency was attributed to structural changes caused due to acid treatments for desorption desorption treatments can often damage the structure and morphology of the adsorbent therefore the desorbing agents and concentrations need to be chosen carefully in order to achieve high recovery of heavy metal and maintain the structure of the adsorbent 6 column studies most of the adsorption studies conducted for the removal of heavy metals in the past few decades evaluate the process in a batch system however the adsorption process on an industrial scale generally takes place in a continuous system some types of reactors used are continuous fluidize bed and pulsed bed continuous moving bed continuous fixed bed reactors upflow or downflow among the types of reactors fixed bed column configuration is preferred for heavy metal removal 216 it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the adsorbent in a continuous flow system a list of studies using agriculture based biosorbents conducted in continuous systems including column properties have been listed in table 15 various mathematical models have been used to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of the columns in an industrial scale operation these mathematical models are based on assumption of axial dispersion external mass transfer intraparticle diffusion and nonlinear isotherms some of these models include thomas bed depth service time bdst the adams and bohart model yoon nelson clark wolborska and modified dose response model and it is noteworthy that the thomas model is widely used for column studies 216 this model is based on the assumption that the adsorption process follows the langmuir isotherm model with no axial dispersion details of this process are depicted in fig 5 column studies are based on breakthrough curves these curves are a graphical plot of contaminant effluent versus time factors such as bed height flowrate and amount of adsorbent in the column also greatly affect the adsorption capacity 218 219 for instance in a study conducted by cheraghi et al 220 the authors used sesame waste biomass for the removal of cd ii from aqueous solutions in a fixed bed column the authors reported that with the increase in bed depth from 2 4 and 6 cm there was an increase in removal efficiency to 67 67 75 88 and 77 respectively this can be attributed to increase in biosorbent mass in the column and thereby the adsorbent total mass surface area available for adsorption which would provide more adsorption sites on the other hand it was observed that with the increase in bed depth the cd ii uptake capacity had reduced at a bed height of 2 cm an optimum breakthrough curve was achieved the authors also varied the flow rate from 2 5 to 4 5 ml min the results showed that as the flow rate increased from 2 5 and 4 5 ml min the uptake capacity of cd ii reduced from 22 88 to 15 13 mg g moreover by fitting the experimental data into mathematical models the yoon nelson and thomas models were able predict the adsorption performance for cd ii adsorption in a fixed bed column rosales et al 117 also evaluated the effect of flow rate on the adsorption of cr vi on grapefruit peelings based on the homogeneous surface diffusion model hsdm with an adsorption column of height 1 5 m volume 100 l and internal diameter 0 3 m the results explained that upon increasing the flow rate the breakthrough time was obtained earlier and the biosorbent was saturated in a shorter amount of time at an effluent concentration of 90 of the initial value the biosorbent would be exhausted in 62 5 44 34 5 29 days for cr vi with flow rates of 0 5 1 1 5 2 2 5 l min nakkeeran et al 221 also noticed the similar trend when the authors studied the effect on adsorption by varying flow rates of the cr vi laden influent on strychnos nux vomica fruit shell it was reported that the breakthrough time had declined as flow rate increased the biosorption capacity had also reduced as the flow rate increased moreover the removal percentage of cr vi reduced from 65 14 to 34 69 with an increase in flow rate upon evaluation of mathematical models the thomas and bdst model presented better agreement with the equilibrium data the effect of initial metal concentration was also evaluated at a fixed bed height of 3 cm and a constant flow rate of 5 ml min the results revealed a decrease in breakthrough time with an increase in initial metal concentration the biosorption capacity had increased with the increase in initial metal concentration 221 this can be attributed to the presence of cr vi molecules on the film layer formed on the surface this will initiate a rapid movement at higher concentration of metal to the biosorbent surface because of elevation in the coefficient of mass transfer the removal percentage had reduced from 65 14 to 37 24 with the increase in metal ion concentration like many studies higher removal of chromium occurred at low flow rates low initial metal ion concentration and larger bed height 7 biosorption of heavy metals from real industrial wastewater industrial wastewater consists of various types and quantities of pollutants depending upon the industry they are discharged from effluents from industrial wastewater usually consists of different types of ions that can compete with the heavy metal ions for active sites on the surface of the biosorbent therefore it is necessary to analyse the biosorption process using real industrial wastewater as most of the studies use synthetic heavy metal wastewater for example razak et al 226 used phosphoric acid to modify kenaf fiber for the removal of copper ii ions from electroplating and wood treatment industry the adsorption capacity of copper ions from the electroplating industry and from the wood treatment industry was 33 55 mg g and 37 18 mg g respectively in a single metal ion synthetically spiked system the adsorption capacity was 57 14 mg g electroplating industry contains various other metal ions as copper zinc tin and gold whereas wood treatment effluent is rich in arsenate therefore more than one type of ions was competing for the active sites on the biosorbent and reduced the adsorption capacity in another study abdolali et al 227 used a mixture of tea waste tw maple leaves ml and mandarin peel mp to remove cd cu pb and zn from real and synthetic wastewater the real wastewater was taken from the primary effluent downstream of the malabar wwtp sedimentation tanks collected from sydney waterplant nsw australia the experiment was carried out in a packed bed column prior to the adsorption experiment the sewage was settled for 24 h and filtered using a 150 μm sieve the wastewater was spiked with heavy metal 20 mg l solution due to undetectable amounts in municipal wastewater the ph was not altered the wastewater consisted of various other contaminants mentioned in table 16 the results showed that the biosorbent removed more than 90 of cd ii cu ii pb ii and zn ii ions from 3227 2617 1714 and 2019 ml municipal wastewater in 322 261 171 and 201 min respectively it was also reported that the biosorption capacity was similar to that achieved with synthetic wastewater bulgariu et al 228 used sulphur based soy waste for removal of pb ii cu ii and ni ii from industrial water from a local printing circuit board company in the wastewater samples the concentration of heavy metal ions was adjusted to 0 4 mmol m ii l it was reported that 98 of the heavy metals were removed from the water and achieved the permissible limit the values of pb ii cu ii and ni ii had reduced from 83 70 mg l 25 50 mg l 23 50 mg l to 0 4381 mg l 0 1673 mg l 0 6237 mg l after biosorption 8 cost analysis cost analysis is a very essential factor to evaluate the practical applicability of the adsorption process in general it is often mentioned that agricultural wastes are very cost effective in comparison to commercial adsorbents this section aims to compile some of the scattered information regarding the costs of biosorbents the cost analysis studies are listed in table 17 in a study conducted by sharma and ayub 231 the authors conducted a thorough cost analysis of using pea pisum sativum pod peels tea camellia sinensis ginger zingiber officinale mix and banana musa lacatan peels used to adsorb cr vi from wastewater according to their analysis the cost to adsorb 1 g of cr vi from wastewater was rs 9 14 rs 4 71 and rs 3 11 respectively the cost is significantly cheaper when compared to adsorption by commercial activated carbon which was rs 142 145 peanut hull is a very commonly used agricultural waste that is employed in biosorption processes in a study conducted by ali et al 203 the author stated that the egyptian peanut hulls that have been used to remove cu ii in their study were inexpensive and cost l e 800 t the finished product including all costs such as peanut hulls electrical energy handling transportation chemicals drying etc was approximately l e 2000 t another common and abundantly available agricultural waste is rice husk it was reported that the cost of using chemically activated risk husk as an adsorbent was 2 579 usd which is very economical this cost covers collection of the rice husk cleaning costs size reduction costs drying and pyrolysis costs and chemical activation costs since the agricultural waste was collected by farmers in this study it was free of cost 232 moreover during mass production these costs are expected to drop further elhafez et al 233 also performed a techno economic analysis on the usage of rice husk based biosorbent rice husk as a raw material can be sold at a low price of 42 t for a 1200 t y production rate the operational cost was estimated to be 50 400 y the authors estimated that rice husk based adsorbent would cost 420 t on the basis of an adsorbent of 1200 tons year it was estimated that the revenue of the plant would be higher than the operational costs leaving a net profit of 144 000 y more details on the cost calculations are listed in table 17 sugarcane bagasse is another effective and common agricultural waste used in the adsorption of heavy metals in a study conducted by gupta et al 234 it was reported that the total cost for the preparing 1 kg of adsorbent was estimated as inr 49 28 inr 309 65 and inr 103 40 for sugarcane bagasse acid activated sugarcane bagasse and base activated sugarcane bagasse respectively chemical modification raises the price of the adsorbent material in this study the unmodified sugarcane per gram of cu ii removal cost inr 10 18 the cost to remove of 1 g of cu ii from the wastewater using acid activated sugarcane bagasse and base activated sugarcane bagasse was inr 57 88 and inr 50 19 respectively although the chemical modification increased the price it was still found to be significantly cheaper than the commercial activated carbon purchased by the authors which costed inr 649 47 bhatnagar et al 86 reported that lemon peels were an efficient an economic option for the removal of heavy metals from waste water the cost of lemon peels was approximated to 5 6 usd 100 200 tonnes whereas the cost of activated carbon was estimated to 2000 usd tonne the total cost of the final adsorbent including costs of electrical energy transportation chemicals was estimated to 100 200 usd tonne which is about 10 times cheaper than the activated carbon fawzy et al 235 performed a techno economic analysis on adsorption of cadmium ions by olive leaves olea europaea l waste it was assumed that annual feed of industrial wastewater which is 7000 m3 year was being treated with adsorption as the tertiary stage of the wastewater treatment plant as shown in table 17 the net cost which is bc benefit cost oc operating cost for the application of adsorption as tertiary treatment was 0 014 usd m3 the positive value depicts that the adsorption system would eventually gain financial profits and compensate for the ac amortization cost the payback period was calculated as ac 0 0080 usd m3 the annual net profit 0 0014 usd m3 year which was 5 7 years this duration was shorter than 10 years which was the lifetime of the implying the practicality of the investment 9 conclusion future prospects and recommendations to address the concern of heavy metal removal adsorption process has various advantages such as ease of operability low sludge production removal of heavy metals presents at a low concentration when compared to other commonly used technologies such as membrane technology ion exchange coagulation flocculation etc biosorbents modified chemically via acids alkalis polymers grafting co polymerization and with metal salts to produce magnetic biosorbents and modifying with other organic chemicals have proven to be a cost effective and highly efficient chemical modification with acids often showed the highest sorption efficiency it can be concluded that most of the biosorption processes follow the langmuir or freundlich isotherm model more commonly pseudo second order kinetic model is applicable to the biosorption process the process is usually spontaneous and endothermic in nature the regeneration of biosorbents was most effective when acids were used as eluents which allowed some biosorbents to be reused efficiently up to 10 times the cost analysis revealed that agricultural waste based biosorbents are significantly cheaper than commercial biosorbents such as activated carbon however there are many key areas of biosorption that need to be addressed in order to bring lab scale studies to large scale applications in the industry most of the studies are based upon mono metal synthetically prepared heavy metal solutions real wastewater needs to be used in the experiments wastewater consists of various other contaminants including other heavy metals which can create competition between ions and inherently saturate the active sites quickly more research into multi metal interactions in a solution can help in understanding prevalence of metal ions on a particular biosorbent there is a tremendous amount of lab based research on the removal of heavy metals but there is a lack of pilot studies that are conducted on an industrial scale comparative studies between commercially used adsorbent material and novel biosorbents should be conducted in order to analyse the advantages of the process over existing processes there is a lack of biosorption studies that are conducted in continuous reactors most of the experiments are conducted in flasks in flasks it is easy to control factors contributing to biosorption studies should be conducted with reactors such as continuous flow reactors and packed bed reactors to understand large scale implementations better in addition regeneration of biosorbents should be tested in a continuous flow column running parallel to the adsorption process operating in a continuous flow column chemical modifications play a huge role in the performance of a biosorbent development in techniques to increase the mechanical strength of biosorbents and increase available adsorption sites by increasing surface area pores and number of metal binding functional groups is essential hybrid biosorbents formed by combining biosorbents with other natural compounds such as nanobentonite chitosan and cellulose based biosorbents should be explored for improved performance additionally combination of agricultural wastes with different types or synthetic and organic polymers should be explored widely one of the major drawbacks of biosorbents is there low mechanical strength polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylidene fluoride can incorporated in the biosorbent backbone to increase their strength combining biosorption with other wastewater treatment steps can be explored for example combining biosorption process with coagulation photo electrocatalysis electro coagulation etc because the nature of wastewater will not allow treatment with biosorbents alone biosorbents can be used as a pre treatment step for various industries groundwater or stormwater where the concentration of heavy metals is low performing chemical modification on biosorbents tremendously increases the adsorption capacity however this also means that a large amount of chemicals will be used and the overall production cost will also increase the economic aspect of the process is often neglected therefore an end to end study on biosorption using modified agricultural wastes needs to be conducted to understand the techno economic aspects of the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
