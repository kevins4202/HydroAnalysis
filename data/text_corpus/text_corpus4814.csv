24070,we use a coupled physical biogeochemical model to investigate the drivers and mechanisms responsible for the spatiotemporal variability of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in seawater pco2 and associated air sea co2 fluxes in the northern humboldt current system nhcs simulated pco2 is in good agreement with available observations with an average absolute error of approximately 24 µatm the highly productive upwelling region 300 km from the shore and between 5 and 17 s is shown to be a strong co2 source with an averaged flux of 5 60 2 94 mol c m 2 year 1 which represents an integrated carbon flux of 0 028 0 015 pg c year 1 through a series of model experiments we show that the high pco2 is primarily the result of coastal upwelling which is incompletely compensated by biology specifically the supply of dissolved inorganic carbon dic rich waters to the surface pushes pco2 up to levels around 1100 µatm even though biological production is high it reduces pco2 only by about 300 µatm we show that this relatively low degree of biological compensation which implies an inefficient biological pump in the nearshore domain results from a spatiotemporal decoupling between the counteracting effects of biological production and the transport and mixing of dic the contribution of the outgassing and the processes affecting co2 solubility associated with the seasonal cycle of heating and cooling are minor across the whole domain the balance of mechanisms is similar but with smaller amplitudes we demonstrate that seawater pco2 is more sensitive to changes in dic and sea surface temperature while alkalinity plays a minor role keywords eastern south pacific humboldt current system partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 air sea co2 fluxes spatiotemporal variability of pco2 co2 carbonate system 1 introduction eastern boundary upwelling systems ebus s are the most productive regions of the world s oceans pauly and christensen 1995 carr 2001 carr and kearns 2003 they are characterized by the enhanced upwelling of carbon rich waters and large export of organic carbon ebus s are very sensitive to climate perturbations particularly in terms of ocean acidification surface warming and deoxygenation trends stramma et al 2008 gruber 2011 bakun et al 2015 they are naturally more acidic than most of the surface ocean due to their high carbon and low oxygen contents this can potentially induce changes in species composition as a consequence of climate change hauri et al 2009 doney et al 2012 rendering these systems key coastal regions to evaluate other potential consequences by understanding the biogeochemical role on the co2 carbonate system and its vulnerability ebus s contribute very significantly to the gas exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere particularly with respect to atmospheric co2 while some ebus s are strong sinks of atmospheric co2 e g the u s pacific coast off oregon hales et al 2005 borges et al 2005 others are shown to be strong sources of co2 chavez et al 1999 feely et al 2002 2006 in situ observations show that the northern humboldt current system nhcs is a strong source of co2 friederich et al 2008 in fact the nhcs is one of the regions with the highest seawater pco2 worldwide takahashi et al 2009 but the extent and magnitude of this source nature of co2 has not yet been quantified identifying and quantifying the underlying processes that control seawater pco2 in this important ebus is essential for a more accurate assessment of the marine carbon cycle at regional and global scales by doing so we will be able to quantify changes in seawater pco2 induced by climate variations of the drivers in the region in this study we present the first eddy resolving modelling work focusing on seawater pco2 in the nhcs we quantify the contribution of the main drivers dic temperature alkalinity and freshwater of seawater pco2 in addition the mechanisms that control pco2 variability namely biology air sea co2 fluxes co2 solubility and circulation are also investigated by means of model sensitivity experiments our methodology is based on previous modeling studies doney et al 2009 turi et al 2014 arruda et al 2015 for example doney et al 2009 found that the biological export and thermal solubility effects on pco2 act to damp partially the circulation driven biogeochemical variability in the tropical region turi et al 2014 explained the neutral nature of air sea co2 flux in the california current system based on the fact that the uptake co2 flux in the offshore region compensates the outgassing in the nearshore band on an annual scale this work is organized as follows section 2 shows the model setup the methodology of the sensitivity study of pco2 drivers and mechanisms and the details of the air sea co2 flux computation in section 3 we show the validation of modeled seawater pco2 as well as the analyses of the drivers and mechanisms that modulate its spatiotemporal variability and associated air sea co2 flux the main findings of the work are summarized in section 4 2 methods 2 1 model setup in this study we used the pisces pelagic interaction scheme for carbon and ecosystem studies biogeochemical model aumont et al 2003 aumont and bopp 2006 coupled to the roms agrif regional oceanic modeling system hydrodynamical model shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 2009 the domain of simulation spans the region between 70 100 w and from 4 n to 26 s the horizontal resolution is 1 12 9 km with 30 vertical sigma levels refined toward the surface i e the upper 300 m contain 18 sigma levels roms was forced at the boundaries physical tracers with a monthly climatology constructed for the period 1999 2009 from an eddy permitting global ocean reanalysis namely the cmcc global ocean

ofuro as a monthly climatology at 1 4 resolution computed from 2002 to 2007 a monthly climatology of the net heat fluxes computed from 1999 to 2009 was extracted from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf ocean analysis system ora s3 balmaseda et al 2008 in order to better reproduce the sea surface temperature seasonal cycle we adjusted the maximum and minimum values of ecmwf fluxes to that of modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra2 bosilovich et al 2015 during the cold phase of the climatological year in addition we used a more modern and higher resolution satellite derived products to compute the dqdsst nudging term i e the kinematic surface net heat sensitivity to the sea surface temperature where the air temperature specific humidity and wind speed forcings were extracted from the j ofuro database the evaporation and precipitation monthly climatology rates come from the woods hole oceanographic institute s objectively analyzed air sea heat fluxes whoi oaflux v 3 available at http oaflux whoi edu and from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm tmi v 3 available at http www remss com missions tmi at 1 and 1 4 horizontal resolution respectively both computed from 1998 to 2006 the monthly wind stress climatology comes from the quickscat satellite scatterometer liu et al 1998 risien and chelton 2008 for the period 1999 2009 nutrients nitrate phosphate silicate and oxygen were extracted from the world ocean atlas 2013 v 2 garcia et al 2014 for the upper ocean and from a global model output nemo pisces for the ocean interior aumont et al 2003 dissolved organic carbon and iron come from the latter the surface forcing for pisces includes atmospheric iron dust input following tegen and fung 1995 total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon dic were obtained from global ocean data analysis project glodap v2 2016b olsen et al 2016 lauvset et al 2016 the carbonate chemistry of pisces follows the protocols of the ocean carbon cycle model intercomparison project ocmip more information at http ocmip5 ipsl jussieu fr ocmip the parametrization of the biogeochemical model follows echevin et al 2014 this model setup is the same configuration used in a previous study mogollón and calil 2018 which found that the model reproduces the annual cycle of oxygen with a relatively well oxygenated mixed layer surface oxygen is overestimated in about 5 another bias was found below 120 m depth where the simulated oxygen minimum zone omz is about 14 deeper than the observed one 150 m high nitrate concentrations are well reproduced below the mixed layer depth mld with minimum values at the surface however the paucity of the measurements from woa2013 by the large standard deviation in the region 10 mmol n m 3 explains an overestimation of nitrate concentrations below the mld particularly during the last months of the year in the nhcs the 2 mg chla m 3 isoline depicts the highly productive nearshore area which is narrower in the simulations from 10 s to 15 s when compared to satellite derived observations from modis https modis gsfc nasa gov however the spatial pattern of chla is very well captured by the model exhibiting a similar latitudinal distribution with a strong seaward decrease the simulation reproduces the observed dynamical structure of the nhcs the reader is referred to the supplementary material of mogollón and calil 2018 in which an extensive physical and biogeochemical validation is provided 2 2 model experiment configuration a climatological simulation of the hydrodynamical model was run for 25 years starting from rest statistical equilibrium is reached after 10 years of model run not shown the physical state of the end of year 25 was used as initial conditions in which pisces was coupled starting with the biogeochemical climatological conditions of january after a spin up of five years the biogeochemical tracers reach a nearly repeating annual cycle the model solution used in this study is an average of the last 3 years of simulation from years 6 to 8 in order to remove the interannual variability hereinafter we refer to this solution as the high resolution control simulation due to computer limitations we performed the sensitivity simulations at a coarser half resolution of 1 6 the hydrodynamical model started from rest and was ran for 15 years simulations were restarted from here for 10 more years coupled with pisces we spun up the model for 7 years and set the last year tenth year as the low resolution control simulation all the subsequent sensitivity experiments began from the same physical biogeochemical state year 8 and for consistency the analyses were made for the tenth year of each experiment 2 3 sensitivity of pco2 to drivers seawater pco2 is function of the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon dic alkalinity alk temperature t and salinity neglecting the very small contribution from variations in nutrients sarmiento and gruber 2006 in order to quantify the role of these drivers in causing pco2 variations we decompose seawater pco2 into four components by using a first order taylor expansion higher order terms are neglected following the approach of lovenduski et al 2007 doney et al 2009 turi et al 2014 and arruda et al 2015 using a modified decomposition as follows 1 δ p co 2 p co 2 dic s δ dic s p co 2 alk s δ alk s p co 2 t δ t p co 2 fw δ fw where dic s and alk s are the salinity normalized concentrations of dic and alk respectively normalized to a domain mean salinity of 35 1 this is done in order to remove variations due to the addition or removal of freshwater by precipitation and evaporation δx s are the anomalies with x representing dic alk and t the freshwater fw contribution was estimated as a linear combination between changes in dic and alk with changes in salinity see appendix a in lovenduski et al 2007 these anomalies are either spatial or temporal relative to a domain or an annual mean respectively the partial derivatives p co 2 x were determined by adding a small perturbation to each driver and recalculating pco2 using routines of an offline carbonate chemistry tool based on the ocmip protocols these perturbations are the 0 1 of the domain mean value of dic alk and t which are 2061 8 µmol c l 1 2304 7 µmol c l 1 and 21 c respectively 2 4 sensitivity of pco2 to mechanisms in order to identify the main physical and biogeochemical mechanisms responsible for the spatiotemporal variability of seawater pco2 a series of sensitivity experiments were performed for consistency we consider the same four mechanisms from turi et al 2014 and arruda et al 2015 that affect pco2 variability i air sea co2 flux which is due to the gas exchange at the air sea interface ii co2 solubility which is mainly driven by temperature variations due to the seasonal cycle of warming and cooling iii biology which includes the net effect of the formation of organic matter and caco3 and their remineralization and dissolution and iv circulation which is attributed to the physical transport and mixing of dic and alk from the boundaries into the interior of the domain and then to the surface thus impacting pco2 the methodology follows turi et al 2014 and arruda et al 2015 and consists in progressively excluding each mechanism see eq 2 as follows 2 p co 2 control ctrl p co 2 gas ex ctrl s1 p co 2 biology s1 s2 p co 2 solubility s2 s3 p co 2 circulation s3 1 we first set the gas transfer velocity in the model to zero thereby inhibiting any co2 exchange at the surface we referred to this first sensitivity experiment simulation as s1 the difference in pco2 between the control simulation and s1 pco 2 ctrl pco 2 s1 is thus the impact of the air sea co2 fluxes on seawater pco2 2 in the second experiment s2 we started from s1 but additionally set the net shortwave radiation sw as zero and consequently the photosynthetically available radiation par is zero by doing so we eliminate phytoplankton growth and consequently biological production of organic carbon in our solution this radiative forcing is used exclusively for the biology and it does not affect the net heat fluxes computation the difference in pco2 between s1 and s2 pco 2 s1 pco 2 s2 is the contribution of biology on seawater pco2 3 in the third experiment s3 the impact of the solubility was eliminated by keeping a constant domain averaged temperature and salinity value for our domain of analysis we set t 21 c and s 35 1 respectively for these values the co2 solubility is 0 0323 mol kg 1 atm 1 the difference in pco2 between s2 and s3 pco 2 s2 p co 2 s3 represents the impact of the variable co2 solubility to total seawater pco2 i e the impact of sea surface temperature sst and salinity on pco2 4 finally since in s3 the contribution of gas exchange biology and co2 solubility were eliminated the only mechanism impacting the pco2 is the circulation which will transport and mix dic and alk in the entire domain thus s3 itself represents a solution where pco2 is affected only by the circulation this sensitivity study is likely an approximation of the impact of the mechanisms that affect pco2 for a variety of reasons i the separation method assumes a linearity of each mechanism which is clearly a simplification of the complex carbonate system sarmiento and gruber 2006 ii lateral boundary conditions remain intact for each sensitivity simulation potentially inducing a bias in our solutions iii furthermore each sensitivity simulation s1 s2 and s3 was spun up for 2 years years 8 and 9 which is a short period for the co2 carbonate system to totally adjust to the new forcings i e the simulations have not completely come into steady state in spite of the degradation of the horizontal resolution the low resolution control simulation still represents the spatiotemporal variability pattern of temperature dic alk see appendix a1 chlorophyll and the equatorial and coastal circulation not shown as well as the major mesoscale features of the nhcs when compared to the high resolution control simulation 2 5 air sea co2 fluxes computation the co2 flux at the air sea interface f co 2 is calculated as 3 f co 2 k 0 k w p co 2 sea p co 2 air where the atmospheric pco2 or p co 2 air is fixed at a modern value of 397 µatm referenced to year 2015 estimated from the globalview co2 2013 data product p co 2 air is considered stationary because it is uniform over the region and oscillates seasonally with an amplitude of approximately 2 µatm around the mean value not shown k 0 is the co2 solubility constant computed using the formulation of weiss 1974 which depends on temperature and salinity kw is the co2 transfer piston velocity that measures the combined effect of various physical processes including molecular diffusion turbulent mixing surface waves bubbles and spray on the exchange across the air sea interface jähne and haußecker 1998 it is proportional to the square of the wind speed following the formulation of wanninkhof 1992 p co 2 sea is the partial pressure of the surface ocean co2 the convention is that positive values of f co 2 denote an outgassing of co2 i e from the ocean to the atmosphere while negative values indicate an uptake by the surface ocean i e from the atmosphere to the ocean since k 0 and kw are positive quantities the sign of f co 2 will be determined by the difference between the partial pressure of co2 in seawater and air p co 2 sea p co 2 air as a consequence regions where p co 2 sea 397 µatm will act as a source and regions where p co 2 sea 397 µatm will be a sink of atmospheric co2 hereinafter we use seawater pco2 when referring to p co 2 sea 2 6 domains of analysis the same methodology as turi et al 2014 and arruda et al 2015 to both drivers and mechanisms were applied for two domains i the nhcs region as a whole ranging from 0 to 20 s and from 70 w to 90 w hereinafter referred to as the regional domain and ii for a subdomain focusing on the highly productive upwelling region within the 300 km nearshore band and from 5 s to 17 s hereinafter referred to as the nearshore domain the limits of the regional domain were chosen following 3 criteria namely i to be away from the model boundaries ii to span the most productive region of the peruvian biogeochemical province pennington et al 2006 and iii to minimize uncertainties in the sensitivity analysis by choosing a large scale domain 3 results and discussions 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 gridded in situ databases and model skill assessment in order to evaluate the model skill in reproducing seawater pco2 we used a set of quantitative metrics comparing the model output with observational data the statistical metrics are the correlation coefficient r the root mean squared error rmse the reliability index ri the average error or bias ae the average absolute error aae the modeling efficiency mef the cost function cf and the percentage of bias pb the correlation coefficient measures the tendency of the simulated and observed values to vary together ideally this value will be close to one rmse ae and aae are all measures of the size of the discrepancies between modeled and observed values together these three statistics provide an indication of the model prediction accuracy values near zero indicate a close match ri quantifies the average factor by which modeled values differ from observations a good model prediction yields ri values close to one mef measures how well a model predicts a variable relative to the average of the observations a value near one indicates a close match between observations and model predictions for a more detailed explanation of these parameters the reader is referred to stow et al 2009 cf is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model and data and pb is the performance indicator dabrowski et al 2014 if mef is greater than 0 65 the prediction is excellent for values in the range 0 5 0 65 the prediction is considered very good for the range between 0 2 and 0 5 the prediction is good and for values smaller than 0 2 the prediction is poor bad similarly pb evaluates the model as follows 10 excellent 10 20 very good 20 40 good 40 poor bad maréchal 2004 if cf 1 excellent very good 1 2 good 2 3 reasonable and 3 poor bad moll and radach 2003 the statistics were applied to the annual average of seawater pco2 within the limits of the domain of simulation due to the sparseness of available observations in addition the spatial standard deviation of the observations can be inferred dividing aae by cf the databases used for the comparison are the surface ocean co2 atlas database socat v 6 bakker et al 2016 and the carbon dioxide research group of the lamont doherty earth observatory ldeo of columbia university takahashi et al 2018 for consistency we converted all the observed fugacity of co2 fco2 from socat from 1970 to 2016 to pco2 using the co2sys program van heuven et al 2011 fugacity is about 0 3 0 4 lower than pco2 due to the non ideality of the co2 gas weiss 1974 since our climatological simulation is representative of a modern oceanic state observed data were normalized to the year 2015 assuming an annual global mean seawater pco2 increase rate of 1 5 µatm year 1 takahashi et al 2009 the ldeo database consists of underway observations obtained from 9 cruises in 1998 2000 2002 2004 2005 2009 2012 and 2013 between may and october to facilitate the comparison with the model we binned ldeo observations into 1 12 1 12 grid boxes and normalized them to the year 2015 we then extracted the simulated pco2 values from may to october and performed the comparison only using the grid boxes containing observations fig 1 a d show the comparison between the seasonal mean pco2 from socat and the simulated pco2 the model reproduces very well the observed climatological seasonal mean pco2 see table 1 the simulation captures the southeast northwestward progression of high pco2 along the coastal and equatorial upwelling regions throughout the year the paucity of measurements does not allow a more robust statistical comparison particularly during summer and fall for instance only one cruise during march 2002 measured pco2 along the coastal zone between 11 s and 5 s and that transect alone is the climatological value for summer fig 1e shows a comparison between our model simulation and observations from ldeo the model captures both the latitudinal gradient of pco2 and the regional differences during the cold phase of the year statistical metrics are summarized in table 1 mef values show our results as good while cf and pb values show that our results are excellent when compared to both socat and ldeo ri and r indicate that our simulated pco2 has the right amplitude and is highly correlated with the observations respectively the statistical indicators rmse ae and aae showed a good agreement between modeled and observed values furthermore ae shows that the pco2 is underestimated by almost 4 µatm and is overestimated by only 1 2 µatm when compared to socat and ldeo respectively these are very small values when compared to a mean pco2 of 418 and 432 µatm for the socat and ldeo databases respectively 3 1 2 socat based products the surface ocean pco2 mapping intercomparison socom http www bgc jena mpg de socom is an initiative that provides several data based mapping methods that use different versions of the socat database we compared our results with the jena carboscope oc v1 6 which provides estimates of global seawater pco2 from an observationally driven ocean mixed layer scheme derived from socat v 6 update of rödenbeck et al 2014 a monthly climatology was constructed from 1999 through 2009 from this product same period as the boundary conditions and the wind stress climatological forcings used in this study due to the coarse horizontal resolution of this socat based product 4 5 the comparison was performed from a large scale perspective simulated pco2 is well correlated r 0 72 with high pco2 values along the equatorial and nearshore band not shown the statistical metrics are shown in table 1 labeled as rödenbeck which rate our results as good excellent we also performed a comparison with another socat based product in which a 30 year observationlly based pco2 field was created using a 2 step neural network technique namely the self organizing map feed forward neural network som ffn method landschützer et al 2015a 2015b this gridded sea surface pco2 product may be found at http cdiac ess dive lbl gov ftp oceans spco2 1982 2011 eth som ffn for consistency a monthly climatology was constructed from 1999 through 2009 in order to perform an annual mean comparison our results are in excellent agreement with this socat based pco2 product see table 1 labeled as landschützer spatial differences were found probably due to the coarse horizontal resolution of 1 when compared to our simulations at 1 12 resolution this smoothed reconstructed socat based pco2 is overestimated by our simulations in approximately 5 4 µatm with small differences positive bias located between 2 s and 10 s not shown despite these small biases all metrics are rated as very good excellent laruelle et al 2017 used a modified version of the som ffn method to interpolate seawater pco2 data along the global continental margins with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0 25 at a monthly temporal scale they successfully reproduce the spatial patterns of pco2 across all ocean basins and their seasonality except for some coastal upwelling regions such as the shelves of california morocco and peru the annual mean rmse between this socat based product and our simulated pco2 is 255 µatm with maximum errors located within the 100 km wide coastal strip not shown the statistical metrics evaluated the model as poor bad see table 1 this weaker performance of the som ffn method in highly productive coastal areas is due to the high frequency variability and complex physical biogeochemical dynamics laruelle et al 2017 this is particularly true for the most productive area of the nhcs nearshore domain where the interpolated values do not capture the spatiotemporal variability of seawater pco2 3 1 3 comparison with previous observational studies our simulation captures an intense offshore gradient of pco2 ranging between 500 and 1000 µatm in agreement with historical data simpson and zirino 1980 copin montégut and raimbault 1994 this general cross shelf trend of pco2 has been observed during comprenhensive sea surface surveys of pco2 in the nhcs conducted from 2004 to 2006 friederich et al 2008 which found that the average pco2 is above atmospheric values 378 µatm at that time at all latitudes the lowest pco2 values 150 µatm and the highest ones 1500 µatm were found over the shelf near the coast our results are consistent with these observations with lowest and highest values of 235 and 1370 µatm respectively friederich et al 2008 showed that the most notable characteristic is that pco2 decreases with distance from shore for the first 100 km and then stabilizes but remains well above atmospheric values and does not tend towards equilibrium with the atmosphere over the outer 300 km thus our modeled results see fig 1 are consistent with the observed spatial pattern of pco2 they also showed that the air sea co2 fluxes between 4 s and 20 s and from 0 to 350 km from the shore with most measurements made within the 200 km nearshore band and between 5 s and 16 s exceed 5 mol c m 2 year 1 on an annual basis they estimated 10 mol c m 2 year 1 during periods of strong upwelling and 2 5 mol c m 2 year 1 during periods of weak upwelling as the period of strong upwelling low productivity occurs during winter and the period of weak upwelling high productivity occurs during summer we can consequently compare our results with their observations within the nearshore domain see fig 2 a and d our simulated air sea co2 fluxes over similar spatial criteria are 9 2 and 2 2 mol c m 2 year 1 during winter and summer respectively while the annual mean is 5 6 mol c m 2 year 1 which is very close to the observed air sea co2 fluxes although most cruises occurred during winter spring friederich et al 2008 estimated an annual mean flux of carbon of 5 7 mol c m 2 year 1 which represents an integrated flux of 0 055 pg c year 1 when applied to an area encompassed by 2000 km of coastline and 400 km from the shore for comparison we estimated an annual mean flux of 4 15 2 21 mol c m 2 year 1 representing an integrated evasion flux of 0 041 0 022 pg c year 1 under similar spatial criteria which are 400 km from the shore but from 2 to 20 s approximately 2000 km of coastline estimates for the regional and nearshore domain in this study are shown in table 2 in summary our results are in excellent agreement with the observed seawater pco2 and associated air sea co2 fluxes which are consistently positive in the region i e from the ocean to the atmosphere therefore our simulation is robust enough in order to proceed with the analysis of the mechanisms and drivers affecting pco2 variability in a climatological sense in the nhcs 3 2 spatiotemporal variability of air sea co2 fluxes the annual mean pattern of air sea co2 fluxes is shown in fig 2a the annual means of two terms involved in their computation see eq 3 namely the co2 transfer velocity k w and the co2 solubility k0 are also shown in fig 2b and c the dependence of k w on the wind makes the two fields relatively similar with larger values close to the anticylonic subtropical gyre and lower ones along the peruvian coast i e wind drop off zone in addition k w exhibits a contrasting coastal latitudinal gradient for instance around chiclayo 7 s a minimum of 7 6 cm h 1 is obtained while at the southern domain around pisco 14 s a maximum of 12 8 cm h 1 is found this results in a relatively large co2 exchange efficiency in the southern coastal region given the inverse relationship between temperature and k0 larger values of the latter are found in the upwelling coastal region and lower values at the northern part of the domain near the equatorial band which is characterized by warmer surface waters fig 2c the source sink threshold i e the zero crossing line depicted in fig 2a as a solid black line has been reported to occur between 21 s and 27 s torres et al 1999 2003 our simulations show that this source sink threshold is located along the chilean coastal domain not shown in the northern boundary of the regional domain the crossing limit reaches the equatorian coast which agrees with observed pco2 measurements shown in fig 1 the nhcs as a whole is commonly thought to be a wide co2 outgassing region however it seems to be surrounded by two crossover regions one around the geographical border between peru and ecuador 3 s and another one around the tropic of capricorn at the south 26 s not shown hence regional differences are important when estimating the carbon budget fig 2d shows time series of all terms involved in the air sea co2 flux computation showing that they follow the upwelling intensity throughout the year with a minimum during summer and a maximum during winter seawater pco2 and associated air sea co2 fluxes are highly correlated both temporally and spatially during winter when the winds are significantly enhanced seawater pco2 increases which in turn induce an increase in the air sea co2 flux leading to a stronger source nature of the region see section 3 4 the regional domain has a similar temporal variability as the nearshore domain with different amplitudes not shown the amplitude of the air sea co2 fluxes pco2 and k0 are on average 3 7 mol c m 2 year 1 130 µatm and 0 0025 mol kg 1 atm 1 smaller than the corresponding average amplitude of the nearshore domain however k w is on average 2 4 cm h 1 faster than in the regional domain for comparison takahashi et al 2009 estimated a large co2 source along the equatorial pacific from 14 n to 14 s over an area of 86 7 106 km2 to be 0 48 pg c yr 1 in this study the outgassing flux of carbon was estimated to be 0 07 pg c yr 1 over an area of 5 106 km2 regional domain which represents less than 6 of the entire area of the equatorial pacific however this relatively small area contributes to approximately 15 the total outgassing flux of carbon of the equatorial pacific rendering the nhcs a key region for the global atmospheric carbon budget the sensitivity model simulations allow the separation of the individual contributions of each mechanism to the total air sea co2 fluxes as seen in fig 3 a the source nature of the nearshore domain results primarily from circulation essentially coastal upwelling however the seasonal variability of the mechanisms modulate the strength of the outgassing during summer biological productivity and gas exchange nearly cancel the effect of circulation rendering the region a weak co2 source in the wintertime the stronger source nature of co2 is a result of a more intricate balance between the mechanisms the increase in the winds leads to a decrease of biological productivity and an increase of gas exchange at the same time low sst increases the effect of solubility however these mechanisms are not able to keep up with the increase of circulation in the wintertime on average circulation contributes with a co2 outgassing of approximately 19 mol c m 2 year 1 while the other mechanisms contribute with an uptake of 13 mol c m 2 year 1 the seasonal mean contributions of each mechanism are shown as colored bars in fig 3b a more robust assessment on the drivers and mechanisms behind this source nature is performed in next sections but focusing on seawater pco2 variations rather than on co2 fluxes this is because the sign and magnitude of air sea co2 fluxes are mainly influenced by seawater pco2 changes rather than k0 k w 3 3 spatial variability of annual mean pco2 fig 4 a shows the spatial anomalies of the annual mean pco2 relative to the domain average value of p co 2 461 µatm for the control run this spatial pattern is approximately a reconstruction between all the individual contributions of each driver δ p co 2 ctrl i drivers δ p co 2 i e the sum of fig 4b e results in fig 4a neglecting the residuals as the anomalies were computed based on a 20 20 domain it actually provides a regional scale anomaly pattern with a tongue of positive anomalies projected northwestward from the coast negative anomalies characterize the oligotrophic oceanic area in the southern domain and along the equatorial band this pattern fig 4a is a result of strong spatial gradients in dic s and temperature fig 4b and c the temperature driven pco2 anomalies distinguish the cold and highly productive coastal upwelling band with negative anomalies and the adjacent oligotrophic ocean with relatively warmer waters with positive anomalies for comparison turi et al 2014 found that the most important variables in controlling the spatial variability of pco2 in the california ebus are dics and temperature in agreement with other global and regional studies lovenduski et al 2007 doney et al 2009 signorini et al 2013 ishii et al 2014 arruda et al 2015 the influence of alk s is minor when compared to dic s particularly in the coastal area where it is an order of magnitude smaller fig 4d turi et al 2014 found an important role of alk s in controlling pco2 in the southern california bight arruda et al 2015 found a potentially large impact of alk s in the south brazilian shelf and in the southern ocean region as well they suggested that the elevated alk s contribution could be associated to heterogeneous regions with several distinct surface water masses and frontal zones in our case alk s becomes important in the northern part of the domain positive pco2 anomalies northward of 5 s in fig 4d given the linear relationship between alk and salinity the decrease in surface alk up to 10 the domain mean is attributed to the low salinities associated to different types of water masses such as the tropical and equatorial surface waters in the northern portion of the regional domain graco et al 2007 although we did not explicitly include river discharges in our simulations the signal of associated low salinities runoff influence is represented in our solutions through the climatological surface and lateral forcings the impact of fw may be neglected fig 4e note that a negative pco2 anomaly does not translate into a sink nature of co2 this is because the domain average pco2 p co 2 is 64 µatm above pco 2 air thus neither alk nor fw have the potential by themselves to reduce seawater pco2 below atmospheric levels from a regional scale perspective in the nearshore domain dic contributes with approximately 250 µatm to the total pco2 anomalies meanwhile t alk and fw tend to cancel the dic effect out reducing the domain average pco2 in approximately 97 22 and 1 7 µatm respectively this suggests that the effect of larger dic concentrations in increasing pco2 is up to three times larger than the effect of low sst in decreasing seawater pco2 in order to assess the contribution of the mechanisms behind the spatial gradient of the annual mean pco2 we now look at the results of the sensitivity experiments which are summarized in fig 5 note that instead of showing the spatial anomalies of pco2 due to the drivers as presented in fig 4 here we show the spatial net contribution of each mechanism to total pco2 p co 2 ctrl i mechanisms p co 2 i e the sum of fig 5b e results in fig 5a residuals o 10 13 if pco2 was solely controlled by the circulation physics a pattern similar to fig 5b would be observed on average seawater pco2 reaches values up to 874 µatm due to circulation alone i e the physical transport and mixing of dic and alk the contribution of biology fig 5c is negative nearly everywhere and its average value is 337 µatm this biologically driven pco2 drawdown turns out to be higher further offshore and also within the coastal band south of 17 s the spatial decoupling between the area of maximum upwelling and regions where the biological effect is maximum as shown in fig 5c may be attributed to i the upward transport and mixing of dic and nutrients that are biologically taken up and subsequently exported as organic matter sarmiento and gruber 2006 ii incomplete utilization of upwelled macro nutrients friederich et al 2008 because nitrate is not efficiently used due to iron limitation gruber et al 2009 iii high levels of mesoscale activity that export nutrients offshore gruber et al 2011 where the full potential of biological drawdown of co2 is achieved lachkar and gruber 2011 2013 turi et al 2014 as a consequence the air sea co2 fluxes are not spatially balanced in the nhcs because the nutrient limitation turn out to be high with a relatively low nutrient use efficiency particularly in some important upwelling centers along the peruvian coast mogollón and calil 2018 this low degree of biological compensation implies a sluggish biological pump in the upwelling region of the nhcs which in turns explains the high pco2 values found in the 100 km wide coastal strip and the associated strong co2 outgassing in contrast turi et al 2014 explains that the air sea co2 fluxes in the california current system are essentially balanced due to the highly efficient biological pump in the region i e a net release of co2 in the nearshore band is largely compensated by a net biologically driven uptake of co2 in the offshore region the contribution of the processes affecting co2 solubility fig 5d closely resembles that of temperature see fig 4b this is because of the stronger dependence of co2 solubility on sst than on salinity the solubility driven contribution accounts on average for 19 µatm the contribution of the air sea co2 flux is negative in the central part of the domain in the nhcs see fig 5e evidencing a negative contribution of the gas exchange to total seawater pco2 i e total dic loss through outgassing on average the air sea co2 fluxes contribute to a decrease of seawater pco2 of approximately 95 µatm note that the spatial gradient of air sea co2 flux resembles the annual mean pco2 pattern fig 4a since it is directly tied to regions where the nhcs acts as a source or sink of atmospheric co2 3 4 temporal variability of domain mean pco2 here we focus on the temporal variability of pco2 by investigating the drivers and mechanisms on monthly and seasonal time scales to this end we proceed as in section 3 3 but now considering a domain average of each driver or mechanism the decomposition of the pco2 anomalies into individual contributions for both drivers and mechanisms was applied once for the regional domain the temporal variability for the regional domain and for a subset nearshore domain was analyzed separately additional estimates of the net contribution of each mechanism to the total pco2 instead of pco2 anomalies may be found in appendix a2 for both domains and on seasonal time scales fig 6 a and b show the monthly mean contributions of the four drivers to the total pco2 anomalies for the regional and nearshore domain respectively the associated seasonal contribution is also presented as a bar diagram in fig 6c and d dic s and t are the most important drivers in both domains exhibiting larger amplitudes and they both tend to cancel each other out along the year specifically for the regional domain the pco2 variations driven by dic s tend to diminish and increase pco2 during the first and second half of the year respectively the temperature driven variations follow the seasonal cycle of warming and cooling exhibiting an opposite seasonality to dic s this is more evident in the bar diagram where each driver is highlighted with its seasonal contribution fig 6c in the nearshore domain fig 6b the purely dic driven pco2 anomalies follow the seasonal cycle of the upwelling intensity these dic s driven pco2 variations are always large 250 µatm on average particularly during winter 400 µatm in contrast persistently low sst during all seasons in the upwelling region induces a decrease in pco2 of approximately 96 µatm with a maximum during winter 176 µatm and a minimum during late spring summer 24 µatm overall pco2 is more sensitive to changes in dic than sst in a proportion varying from 2 1 to 4 1 depending on the season fig 6d the seasonal cycle of the alk s driven component has a minor influence on the simulated pco2 for both regions within the regional domain alk s appears to be phase lagged by about 2 months with dic s or t exhibiting a minimum negative anomalies during fall and a maximum positive anomalies during spring this phase shift occurs because alkalinity follows the seasonal cycle of salinity which is also 2 months out of phase with sst on a regional scale in contrast in the nearshore domain alk s driven variations induce a yearlong decrease in pco2 of approximately 22 µatm pco2 variations driven by fw may be neglected for both domains not shown as in the case of the spatial analysis in order to quantify the role of each mechanism in controlling the temporal pco2 variability fig 7 a and b show the temporal fluctuations around 19 874 337 95 and 461 µatm for co2 solubility circulation biology air sea co2 flux and control pco2 respectively by doing so the sum of all individual contributions of the four mechanisms to the pco2 anomalies i e the solid black lines control are the same as in figs 6 and 7 biologically driven pco2 variations follow the so called paradoxical cycle of the surface chlorophyll pennington et al 2006 echevin et al 2008 which is inversely proportional to the intensity of the upwelling thus despite the increased upwelling during winter the nhcs becomes less productive mogollón and calil 2018 in contrast biological production is enhanced during summer fall leading to a stronger biological compensation for both domains for the regional domain fig 7a and c co2 solubility follows the seasonal annual cycle of warming and cooling as it is strongly influenced by changes in temperature the seasonal variations in circulation contribute to a lesser degree to the seasonal pco2 variability while the contribution from the air sea co2 fluxes is negligible however for the nearshore domain see fig 7b and d circulation clearly dominates the seasonal variations in co2 solubility due to persistently low sst play an important role on dampening the effect of circulation in all seasons however based on our simulations this thermal solubility compensation accounts for approximately half of the circulation effect this is consistent with the compensating effect between dic s and t as observed in the analysis of the drivers seasonal variations in air sea co2 fluxes act reducing the overall amplitude of the seasonal pco2 variability but with a smaller contribution than the other three mechanisms fig 7d finally if we sum each individual net contribution from all the mechanisms acting on pco2 within the nearshore domain the resulting seawater pco2 will be 100 280 µatm larger than atmospheric values depending on the season of the year see appendix a2 this positive difference pco 2 sea pco 2 air 0 is the reason why the highly productive upwelling region of the nhcs is a source of atmospheric co2 4 summary and conclusions in this work a series of model simulations were performed using a coupled physical biogeochemical model in order to assess the drivers and mechanisms that control seawater pco2 and associated air sea co2 fluxes in the nhcs in a climatological sense our results demonstrate the strong source nature of the region with an averaged flux of 1 91 0 71 mol c m 2 year 1 which represents an integrated outgassing carbon flux of 0 07 pg c year 1 almost 15 of the entire equatorial pacific this source behaviour is caused by the combination of the upwelling of dic rich waters and an inefficient biological pump in the humboldt ebus previous studies in the california ebus turi et al 2014 lachkar and gruber 2013 show that the high degree of nutrient utilization and the implied high efficiency of the biological pump render the air sea co2 fluxes essentially balanced with a net release of co2 in the nearshore band which is compensated by a net biologically driven uptake of co2 in the offshore region they expect a similar behaviour in the canary ebus given the complete nutrient utilization there however our simulations suggest that this is not the case for the humboldt ebus we show that the low degree of biological compensation results from a spatial and temporal decoupling between the upward transport and mixing of dic and the downward export of organic matter as a consequence the area where the full potential of the biological drawdown of co2 is achieved is found further offshore which explains the high pco2 values found in the 100 km wide coastal strip the temporal decoupling is related to the so called paradoxical cycle of primary production which is opposite to the seasonal cycle of the upwelling intensity the contribution of gas exchange and the processes affecting co2 solubility play a minor role when compared to the ones associated with the biological pump circulation and biology the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the most important drivers are dics and temperature which exhibit opposing effects in controlling pco2 in the nearshore domain the effect of larger dic concentrations due to coastal upwelling in increasing pco2 is up to three times larger than the effect of low sst in decreasing seawater pco2 alk s driven pco2 variations could be neglected since their contribution is one order of magnitude smaller than that of dics similarly the impact of fw is negligible we found that the solubility driven pco2 variations associated with the seasonal warming and cooling of surface waters are nearly fully compensated by biology driven pco2 variations in the regional domain however in the nearshore domain circulation contributes most to the seasonal pco2 variability despite the importance of the nhcs measurements of pco2 along the peruvian coast are still rare this precludes a detailed analysis of a number of processes that affect pco2 variability such as the rapid sea surface warming and the iron limitation of primary production chavez et al 2007 friederich et al 2008 in addition the lack of high frequency pco2 observations does not allow a characterization of the short term variability of the co2 carbonate system which remains open to debate this is further complicated by the highly variable ocean circulation high levels of mesoscale activity and interannual to interdecadal variability feely et al 2006 landschützer et al 2014 for instance el niño southern oscillation enso contributes to the seawater pco2 variability by inducing changes in the thermocline depth wind patterns and consequently upwelling rates feely et al 1999 chavez et al 1999 wanninkhof et al 2013 rödenbeck et al 2014 although we made substantial progress in elucidating the most important contributors to seawater pco2 variability our model simulations did not contain nonseasonal variability such as enso another important caveat is related to the boundary conditions in particular dic and alk specifically the climatologies of these two important parameters of the co2 carbonate system were assumed to be invariant throughout the seasonal cycle in addition the eastern tropical pacific is heavily undersampled and underrepresented in glodap thus larger mapping errors associated with this gridded database could bias our results but not the overall conclusions our work is an initial step in order to understand the mechanisms that control co2 variability on a climatological basis it thus serves as a baseline in order to investigate the impact of future and contemporary climate change on the seawater co2 carbonate system and associated air sea co2 fluxes data availability the outputs of the low and high resolution control simulations 1 6 and 1 12

24070,we use a coupled physical biogeochemical model to investigate the drivers and mechanisms responsible for the spatiotemporal variability of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in seawater pco2 and associated air sea co2 fluxes in the northern humboldt current system nhcs simulated pco2 is in good agreement with available observations with an average absolute error of approximately 24 µatm the highly productive upwelling region 300 km from the shore and between 5 and 17 s is shown to be a strong co2 source with an averaged flux of 5 60 2 94 mol c m 2 year 1 which represents an integrated carbon flux of 0 028 0 015 pg c year 1 through a series of model experiments we show that the high pco2 is primarily the result of coastal upwelling which is incompletely compensated by biology specifically the supply of dissolved inorganic carbon dic rich waters to the surface pushes pco2 up to levels around 1100 µatm even though biological production is high it reduces pco2 only by about 300 µatm we show that this relatively low degree of biological compensation which implies an inefficient biological pump in the nearshore domain results from a spatiotemporal decoupling between the counteracting effects of biological production and the transport and mixing of dic the contribution of the outgassing and the processes affecting co2 solubility associated with the seasonal cycle of heating and cooling are minor across the whole domain the balance of mechanisms is similar but with smaller amplitudes we demonstrate that seawater pco2 is more sensitive to changes in dic and sea surface temperature while alkalinity plays a minor role keywords eastern south pacific humboldt current system partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 air sea co2 fluxes spatiotemporal variability of pco2 co2 carbonate system 1 introduction eastern boundary upwelling systems ebus s are the most productive regions of the world s oceans pauly and christensen 1995 carr 2001 carr and kearns 2003 they are characterized by the enhanced upwelling of carbon rich waters and large export of organic carbon ebus s are very sensitive to climate perturbations particularly in terms of ocean acidification surface warming and deoxygenation trends stramma et al 2008 gruber 2011 bakun et al 2015 they are naturally more acidic than most of the surface ocean due to their high carbon and low oxygen contents this can potentially induce changes in species composition as a consequence of climate change hauri et al 2009 doney et al 2012 rendering these systems key coastal regions to evaluate other potential consequences by understanding the biogeochemical role on the co2 carbonate system and its vulnerability ebus s contribute very significantly to the gas exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere particularly with respect to atmospheric co2 while some ebus s are strong sinks of atmospheric co2 e g the u s pacific coast off oregon hales et al 2005 borges et al 2005 others are shown to be strong sources of co2 chavez et al 1999 feely et al 2002 2006 in situ observations show that the northern humboldt current system nhcs is a strong source of co2 friederich et al 2008 in fact the nhcs is one of the regions with the highest seawater pco2 worldwide takahashi et al 2009 but the extent and magnitude of this source nature of co2 has not yet been quantified identifying and quantifying the underlying processes that control seawater pco2 in this important ebus is essential for a more accurate assessment of the marine carbon cycle at regional and global scales by doing so we will be able to quantify changes in seawater pco2 induced by climate variations of the drivers in the region in this study we present the first eddy resolving modelling work focusing on seawater pco2 in the nhcs we quantify the contribution of the main drivers dic temperature alkalinity and freshwater of seawater pco2 in addition the mechanisms that control pco2 variability namely biology air sea co2 fluxes co2 solubility and circulation are also investigated by means of model sensitivity experiments our methodology is based on previous modeling studies doney et al 2009 turi et al 2014 arruda et al 2015 for example doney et al 2009 found that the biological export and thermal solubility effects on pco2 act to damp partially the circulation driven biogeochemical variability in the tropical region turi et al 2014 explained the neutral nature of air sea co2 flux in the california current system based on the fact that the uptake co2 flux in the offshore region compensates the outgassing in the nearshore band on an annual scale this work is organized as follows section 2 shows the model setup the methodology of the sensitivity study of pco2 drivers and mechanisms and the details of the air sea co2 flux computation in section 3 we show the validation of modeled seawater pco2 as well as the analyses of the drivers and mechanisms that modulate its spatiotemporal variability and associated air sea co2 flux the main findings of the work are summarized in section 4 2 methods 2 1 model setup in this study we used the pisces pelagic interaction scheme for carbon and ecosystem studies

alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon dic were obtained from global ocean data analysis project glodap v2 2016b olsen et al 2016 lauvset et al 2016 the carbonate chemistry of pisces follows the protocols of the ocean carbon cycle model intercomparison project ocmip more information at http ocmip5 ipsl jussieu fr ocmip the parametrization of the biogeochemical model follows echevin et al 2014 this model setup is the same configuration used in a previous study mogollón and calil 2018 which found that the model reproduces the annual cycle of oxygen with a relatively well oxygenated mixed layer surface oxygen is overestimated in about 5 another bias was found below 120 m depth where the simulated oxygen minimum zone omz is about 14 deeper than the observed one 150 m high nitrate concentrations are well reproduced below the mixed layer depth mld with minimum values at the surface however the paucity of the measurements from woa2013 by the large standard deviation in the region 10 mmol n m 3 explains an overestimation of nitrate concentrations below the mld particularly during the last months of the year in the nhcs the 2 mg chla m 3 isoline depicts the highly productive nearshore area which is narrower in the simulations from 10 s to 15 s when compared to satellite derived observations from modis https modis gsfc nasa gov however the spatial pattern of chla is very well captured by the model exhibiting a similar latitudinal distribution with a strong seaward decrease the simulation reproduces the observed dynamical structure of the nhcs the reader is referred to the supplementary material of mogollón and calil 2018 in which an extensive physical and biogeochemical validation is provided 2 2 model experiment configuration a climatological simulation of the hydrodynamical model was run for 25 years starting from rest statistical equilibrium is reached after 10 years of model run not shown the physical state of the end of year 25 was used as initial conditions in which pisces was coupled starting with the biogeochemical climatological conditions of january after a spin up of five years the biogeochemical tracers reach a nearly repeating annual cycle the model solution used in this study is an average of the last 3 years of simulation from years 6 to 8 in order to remove the interannual variability hereinafter we refer to this solution as the high resolution control simulation due to computer limitations we performed the sensitivity simulations at a coarser half resolution of 1 6 the hydrodynamical model started from rest and was ran for 15 years simulations were restarted from here for 10 more years coupled with pisces we spun up the model for 7 years and set the last year tenth year as the low resolution control simulation all the subsequent sensitivity experiments began from the same physical biogeochemical state year 8 and for consistency the analyses were made for the tenth year of each experiment 2 3 sensitivity of pco2 to drivers seawater pco2 is function of the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon dic alkalinity alk temperature t and salinity neglecting the very small contribution from variations in nutrients sarmiento and gruber 2006 in order to quantify the role of these drivers in causing pco2 variations we decompose seawater pco2 into four components by using a first order taylor expansion higher order terms are neglected following the approach of lovenduski et al 2007 doney et al 2009 turi et al 2014 and arruda et al 2015 using a modified decomposition as follows 1 δ p co 2 p co 2 dic s δ dic s p co 2 alk s δ alk s p co 2 t δ t p co 2 fw δ fw where dic s and alk s are the salinity normalized concentrations of dic and alk respectively normalized to a domain mean salinity of 35 1 this is done in order to remove variations due to the addition or removal of freshwater by precipitation and evaporation δx s are the anomalies with x representing dic alk and t the freshwater fw contribution was estimated as a linear combination between changes in dic and alk with changes in salinity see appendix a in lovenduski et al 2007 these anomalies are either spatial or temporal relative to a domain or an annual mean respectively the partial derivatives p co 2 x were determined by adding a small perturbation to each driver and recalculating pco2 using routines of an offline carbonate chemistry tool based on the ocmip protocols these perturbations are the 0 1 of the domain mean value of dic alk and t which are 2061 8 µmol c l 1 2304 7 µmol c l 1 and 21 c respectively 2 4 sensitivity of pco2 to mechanisms in order to identify the main physical and biogeochemical mechanisms responsible for the spatiotemporal variability of seawater pco2 a series of sensitivity experiments were performed for consistency we consider the same four mechanisms from turi et al 2014 and arruda et al 2015 that affect pco2 variability i air sea co2 flux which is due to the gas exchange at the air sea interface ii co2 solubility which is mainly driven by temperature variations due to the seasonal cycle of warming and cooling iii biology which includes the net effect of the formation of organic matter and caco3 and their remineralization and dissolution and iv circulation which is attributed to the physical transport and mixing of dic and alk from the boundaries into the interior of the domain and then to the surface thus impacting pco2 the methodology follows turi et al 2014 and arruda et al 2015 and consists in progressively excluding each mechanism see eq 2 as follows 2 p co 2 control ctrl p co 2 gas ex ctrl s1 p co 2 biology s1 s2 p co 2 solubility s2 s3 p co 2 circulation s3 1 we first set the gas transfer velocity in the model to zero thereby inhibiting any co2 exchange at the surface we referred to this first sensitivity experiment simulation as s1 the difference in pco2 between the control simulation and s1 pco 2 ctrl pco 2 s1 is thus the impact of the air sea co2 fluxes on seawater pco2 2 in the second experiment s2 we started from s1 but additionally set the net shortwave radiation sw as zero and consequently the photosynthetically available radiation par is zero by doing so we eliminate phytoplankton growth and consequently biological production of organic carbon in our solution this radiative forcing is used exclusively for the biology and it does not affect the net heat fluxes computation the difference in pco2 between s1 and s2 pco 2 s1 pco 2 s2 is the contribution of biology on seawater pco2 3 in the third experiment s3 the impact of the solubility was eliminated by keeping a constant domain averaged temperature and salinity value for our domain of analysis we set t 21 c and s 35 1 respectively for these values the co2 solubility is 0 0323 mol kg 1 atm 1 the difference in pco2 between s2 and s3 pco 2 s2 p co 2 s3 represents the impact of the variable co2 solubility to total seawater pco2 i e the impact of sea surface temperature sst and salinity on pco2 4 finally since in s3 the contribution of gas exchange biology and co2 solubility were eliminated the only mechanism impacting the pco2 is the circulation which will transport and mix dic and alk in the entire domain thus s3 itself represents a solution where pco2 is affected only by the circulation this sensitivity study is likely an approximation of the impact of the mechanisms that affect pco2 for a variety of reasons i the separation method assumes a linearity of each mechanism which is clearly a simplification of the complex carbonate system sarmiento and gruber 2006 ii lateral boundary conditions remain intact for each sensitivity simulation potentially inducing a bias in our solutions iii furthermore each sensitivity simulation s1 s2 and s3 was spun up for 2 years years 8 and 9 which is a short period for the co2 carbonate system to totally adjust to the new forcings i e the simulations have not completely come into steady state in spite of the degradation of the horizontal resolution the low resolution control simulation still represents the spatiotemporal variability pattern of temperature dic alk see appendix a1 chlorophyll and the equatorial and coastal circulation not shown as well as the major mesoscale features of the nhcs when compared to the high resolution control simulation 2 5 air sea co2 fluxes computation the co2 flux at the air sea interface f co 2 is calculated as 3 f co 2 k 0 k w p co 2 sea p co 2 air where the atmospheric pco2 or p co 2 air is fixed at a modern value of 397 µatm referenced to year 2015 estimated from the globalview co2 2013 data product p co 2 air is considered stationary because it is uniform over the region and oscillates seasonally with an amplitude of approximately 2 µatm around the mean value not shown k 0 is the co2 solubility constant computed using the formulation of weiss 1974 which depends on temperature and salinity kw is the co2 transfer piston velocity that measures the combined effect of various physical processes including molecular diffusion turbulent mixing surface waves bubbles and spray on the exchange across the air sea interface jähne and haußecker 1998 it is proportional to the square of the wind speed following the formulation of wanninkhof 1992 p co 2 sea is the partial pressure of the surface ocean co2 the convention is that positive values of f co 2 denote an outgassing of co2 i e from the ocean to the atmosphere while negative values indicate an uptake by the surface ocean i e from the atmosphere to the ocean since k 0 and kw are positive quantities the sign of f co 2 will be determined by the difference between the partial pressure of co2 in seawater and air p co 2 sea p co 2 air as a consequence regions where p co 2 sea 397 µatm will act as a source and regions where p co 2 sea 397 µatm will be a sink of atmospheric co2 hereinafter we use seawater pco2 when referring to p co 2 sea 2 6 domains of analysis the same methodology as turi et al 2014 and arruda et al 2015 to both drivers and mechanisms were applied for two domains i the nhcs region as a whole ranging from 0 to 20 s and from 70 w to 90 w hereinafter referred to as the regional domain and ii for a subdomain focusing on the highly productive upwelling region within the 300 km nearshore band and from 5 s to 17 s hereinafter referred to as the nearshore domain the limits of the regional domain were chosen following 3 criteria namely i to be away from the model boundaries ii to span the most productive region of the peruvian biogeochemical province pennington et al 2006 and iii to minimize uncertainties in the sensitivity analysis by choosing a large scale domain 3 results and discussions 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 gridded in situ databases and model skill assessment in order to evaluate the model skill in reproducing seawater pco2 we used a set of quantitative metrics comparing the model output with observational data the statistical metrics are the correlation coefficient r the root mean squared error rmse the reliability index ri the average error or bias ae the average absolute error aae the modeling efficiency mef the cost function cf and the percentage of bias pb the correlation coefficient measures the tendency of the simulated and observed values to vary together ideally this value will be close to one rmse ae and aae are all measures of the size of the discrepancies between modeled and observed values together these three statistics provide an indication of the model prediction accuracy values near zero indicate a close match ri quantifies the average factor by which modeled values differ from observations a good model prediction yields ri values close to one mef measures how well a model predicts a variable relative to the average of the observations a value near one indicates a close match between observations and model predictions for a more detailed explanation of these parameters the reader is referred to stow et al 2009 cf is a measure of the goodness of fit of the model and data and pb is the performance indicator dabrowski et al 2014 if mef is greater than 0 65 the prediction is excellent for values in the range 0 5 0 65 the prediction is considered very good for the range between 0 2 and 0 5 the prediction is good and for values smaller

and 3 poor bad moll and radach 2003 the statistics were applied to the annual average of seawater pco2 within the limits of the domain of simulation due to the sparseness of available observations in addition the spatial standard deviation of the observations can be inferred dividing aae by cf the databases used for the comparison are the surface ocean co2 atlas database socat v 6 bakker et al 2016 and the carbon dioxide research group of the lamont doherty earth observatory ldeo of columbia university takahashi et al 2018 for consistency we converted all the observed fugacity of co2 fco2 from socat from 1970 to 2016 to pco2 using the co2sys program van heuven et al 2011 fugacity is about 0 3 0 4 lower than pco2 due to the non ideality of the co2 gas weiss 1974 since our climatological simulation is representative of a modern oceanic state observed data were normalized to the year 2015 assuming an annual global mean seawater pco2 increase rate of 1 5 µatm year 1 takahashi et al 2009 the ldeo database consists of underway observations obtained from 9 cruises in 1998 2000 2002 2004 2005 2009 2012 and 2013 between may and october to facilitate the comparison with the model we binned ldeo observations into 1 12 1 12 grid boxes and normalized them to the year 2015 we then extracted the simulated pco2 values from may to october and performed the comparison only using the grid boxes containing observations fig 1 a d show the comparison between the seasonal mean pco2 from socat and the simulated pco2 the model reproduces very well the observed climatological seasonal mean pco2 see table 1 the simulation captures the southeast northwestward progression of high pco2 along the coastal and equatorial upwelling regions throughout the year the paucity of measurements does not allow a more robust statistical comparison particularly during summer and fall for instance only one cruise during march 2002 measured pco2 along the coastal zone between 11 s and 5 s and that transect alone is the climatological value for summer fig 1e shows a comparison between our model simulation and observations from ldeo the model captures both the latitudinal gradient of pco2 and the regional differences during the cold phase of the year statistical metrics are summarized in table 1 mef values show our results as good while cf and pb values show that our results are excellent when compared to both socat and ldeo ri and r indicate that our simulated pco2 has the right amplitude and is highly correlated with the observations respectively the statistical indicators rmse ae and aae showed a good agreement between modeled and observed values furthermore ae shows that the pco2 is underestimated by almost 4 µatm and is overestimated by only 1 2 µatm when compared to socat and ldeo respectively these are very small values when compared to a mean pco2 of 418 and 432 µatm for the socat and ldeo databases respectively 3 1 2 socat based products the surface ocean pco2 mapping intercomparison socom http www bgc jena mpg de socom is an initiative that provides several data based mapping methods that use different versions of the socat database we compared our results with the jena carboscope oc v1 6 which provides estimates of global seawater pco2 from an observationally driven ocean mixed layer scheme derived from socat v 6 update of rödenbeck et al 2014 a monthly climatology was constructed from 1999 through 2009 from this product same period as the boundary conditions and the wind stress climatological forcings used in this study due to the coarse horizontal resolution of this socat based product 4 5 the comparison was performed from a large scale perspective simulated pco2 is well correlated r 0 72 with high pco2 values along the equatorial and nearshore band not shown the statistical metrics are shown in table 1 labeled as rödenbeck which rate our results as good excellent we also performed a comparison with another socat based product in which a 30 year observationlly based pco2 field was created using a 2 step neural network technique namely the self organizing map feed forward neural network som ffn method landschützer et al 2015a 2015b this gridded sea surface pco2 product may be found at http cdiac ess dive lbl gov ftp oceans spco2 1982 2011 eth som ffn for consistency a monthly climatology was constructed from 1999 through 2009 in order to perform an annual mean comparison our results are in excellent agreement with this socat based pco2 product see table 1 labeled as landschützer spatial differences were found probably due to the coarse horizontal resolution of 1 when compared to our simulations at 1 12 resolution this smoothed reconstructed socat based pco2 is overestimated by our simulations in approximately 5 4 µatm with small differences positive bias located between 2 s and 10 s not shown despite these small biases all metrics are rated as very good excellent laruelle et al 2017 used a modified version of the som ffn method to interpolate seawater pco2 data along the global continental margins with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0 25 at a monthly temporal scale they successfully reproduce the spatial patterns of pco2 across all ocean basins and their seasonality except for some coastal upwelling regions such as the shelves of california morocco and peru the annual mean rmse between this socat based product and our simulated pco2 is 255 µatm with maximum errors located within the 100 km wide coastal strip not shown the statistical metrics evaluated the model as poor bad see table 1 this weaker performance of the som ffn method in highly productive coastal areas is due to the high frequency variability and complex physical biogeochemical dynamics laruelle et al 2017 this is particularly true for the most productive area of the nhcs nearshore domain where the interpolated values do not capture the spatiotemporal variability of seawater pco2 3 1 3 comparison with previous observational studies our simulation captures an intense offshore gradient of pco2 ranging between 500 and 1000 µatm in agreement with historical data simpson and zirino 1980 copin montégut and raimbault 1994 this general cross shelf trend of pco2 has been observed during comprenhensive sea surface surveys of pco2 in the nhcs conducted from 2004 to 2006 friederich et al 2008 which found that the average pco2 is above atmospheric values 378 µatm at that time at all latitudes the lowest pco2 values 150 µatm and the highest ones 1500 µatm were found over the shelf near the coast our results are consistent with these observations with lowest and highest values of 235 and 1370 µatm respectively friederich et al 2008 showed that the most notable characteristic is that pco2 decreases with distance from shore for the first 100 km and then stabilizes but remains well above atmospheric values and does not tend towards equilibrium with the atmosphere over the outer 300 km thus our modeled results see fig 1 are consistent with the observed spatial pattern of pco2 they also showed that the air sea co2 fluxes between 4 s and 20 s and from 0 to 350 km from the shore with most measurements made within the 200 km nearshore band and between 5 s and 16 s exceed 5 mol c m 2 year 1 on an annual basis they estimated 10 mol c m 2 year 1 during periods of strong upwelling and 2 5 mol c m 2 year 1 during periods of weak upwelling as the period of strong upwelling low productivity occurs during winter and the period of weak upwelling high productivity occurs during summer we can consequently compare our results with their observations within the nearshore domain see fig 2 a and d our simulated air sea co2 fluxes over similar spatial criteria are 9 2 and 2 2 mol c m 2 year 1 during winter and summer respectively while the annual mean is 5 6 mol c m 2 year 1 which is very close to the observed air sea co2 fluxes although most cruises occurred during winter spring friederich et al 2008 estimated an annual mean flux of carbon of 5 7 mol c m 2 year 1 which represents an integrated flux of 0 055 pg c year 1 when applied to an area encompassed by 2000 km of coastline and 400 km from the shore for comparison we estimated an annual mean flux of 4 15 2 21 mol c m 2 year 1 representing an integrated evasion flux of 0 041 0 022 pg c year 1 under similar spatial criteria which are 400 km from the shore but from 2 to 20 s approximately 2000 km of coastline estimates for the regional and nearshore domain in this study are shown in table 2 in summary our results are in excellent agreement with the observed seawater pco2 and associated air sea co2 fluxes which are consistently positive in the region i e from the ocean to the atmosphere therefore our simulation is robust enough in order to proceed with the analysis of the mechanisms and drivers affecting pco2 variability in a climatological sense in the nhcs 3 2 spatiotemporal variability of air sea co2 fluxes the annual mean pattern of air sea co2 fluxes is shown in fig 2a the annual means of two terms involved in their computation see eq 3 namely the co2 transfer velocity k w and the co2 solubility k0 are also shown in fig 2b and c the dependence of k w on the wind makes the two fields relatively similar with larger values close to the anticylonic subtropical gyre and lower ones along the peruvian coast i e wind drop off zone in addition k w exhibits a contrasting coastal latitudinal gradient for instance around chiclayo 7 s a minimum of 7 6 cm h 1 is obtained while at the southern domain around pisco 14 s a maximum of 12 8 cm h 1 is found this results in a relatively large co2 exchange efficiency in the southern coastal region given the inverse relationship between temperature and k0 larger values of the latter are found in the upwelling coastal region and lower values at the northern part of the domain near the equatorial band which is characterized by warmer surface waters fig 2c the source sink threshold i e the zero crossing line depicted in fig 2a as a solid black line has been reported to occur between 21 s and 27 s torres et al 1999 2003 our simulations show that this source sink threshold is located along the chilean coastal domain not shown in the northern boundary of the regional domain the crossing limit reaches the equatorian coast which agrees with observed pco2 measurements shown in fig 1 the nhcs as a whole is commonly thought to be a wide co2 outgassing region however it seems to be surrounded by two crossover regions one around the geographical border between peru and ecuador 3 s and another one around the tropic of capricorn at the south 26 s not shown hence regional differences are important when estimating the carbon budget fig 2d shows time series of all terms involved in the air sea co2 flux computation showing that they follow the upwelling intensity throughout the year with a minimum during summer and a maximum during winter seawater pco2 and associated air sea co2 fluxes are highly correlated both temporally and spatially during winter when the winds are significantly enhanced seawater pco2 increases which in turn induce an increase in the air sea co2 flux leading to a stronger source nature of the region see section 3 4 the regional domain has a similar temporal variability as the nearshore domain with different amplitudes not shown the amplitude of the air sea co2 fluxes pco2 and k0 are on average 3 7 mol c m 2 year 1 130 µatm and 0 0025 mol kg 1 atm 1 smaller than the corresponding average amplitude of the nearshore domain however k w is on average 2 4 cm h 1 faster than in the regional domain for comparison takahashi et al 2009 estimated a large co2 source along the equatorial pacific from 14 n to 14 s over an area of 86 7 106 km2 to be 0 48 pg c yr 1 in this study the outgassing flux of carbon was estimated to be 0 07 pg c yr 1 over an area of 5 106 km2 regional domain which represents less than 6 of the entire area of the equatorial pacific however this relatively small area contributes to approximately 15 the total outgassing flux of carbon of the equatorial pacific rendering the nhcs a key region for the global atmospheric carbon budget the sensitivity model simulations allow the separation of the individual contributions of each mechanism to the total air sea co2 fluxes as seen in fig 3 a the source nature of the nearshore domain results primarily from circulation essentially coastal upwelling however the seasonal variability of the mechanisms modulate the strength of the outgassing during summer biological productivity and gas exchange nearly cancel the effect of circulation rendering the region a weak co2 source in the wintertime the stronger source nature of co2 is a result of a more intricate balance between the mechanisms the increase in the winds leads to a decrease of biological productivity and an increase of gas exchange at the same time low sst increases the effect of solubility however these mechanisms are not able to keep up with the increase of circulation in the wintertime on average circulation contributes with a co2 outgassing of approximately 19 mol c m 2 year 1 while the other mechanisms contribute with an uptake of 13 mol c m 2 year 1 the seasonal mean contributions of each mechanism are shown as colored bars in fig 3b a more robust assessment on the drivers and mechanisms behind this source nature is performed in next sections but focusing on seawater pco2 variations rather than on co2 fluxes this is because the sign and magnitude of air sea co2 fluxes are mainly influenced by seawater pco2 changes rather than k0 k w 3 3 spatial variability of annual mean pco2 fig 4 a shows the spatial anomalies of the annual mean pco2 relative to the domain average value of p co 2 461 µatm for the control run this spatial pattern is approximately a reconstruction between all the individual contributions of each driver δ p co 2 ctrl i drivers δ p co 2 i e the sum of fig 4b e results in fig 4a neglecting the residuals as the anomalies were computed based on a 20 20 domain it actually provides a regional scale anomaly pattern with a tongue of positive anomalies projected northwestward from the coast negative anomalies characterize the oligotrophic oceanic area in the southern domain and along the equatorial band this pattern fig 4a is a result of strong spatial gradients in dic s and temperature fig 4b and c the temperature driven pco2 anomalies distinguish the cold and highly productive coastal upwelling band with negative anomalies and the adjacent oligotrophic ocean with relatively warmer waters with positive anomalies for comparison turi et al 2014 found that the most important variables in controlling the spatial variability of pco2 in the california ebus are dics and temperature in agreement with other global and regional studies lovenduski et al 2007 doney et al 2009 signorini et al 2013 ishii et al 2014 arruda et al 2015 the influence of alk s is minor when compared to dic s particularly in the coastal area where it is an order of magnitude smaller fig 4d turi et al 2014 found an important role of alk s in controlling pco2 in the southern california bight arruda et al 2015 found a potentially large impact of alk s in the south brazilian shelf and in the southern ocean region as well they suggested that the elevated alk s contribution could be associated to heterogeneous regions with several distinct surface water masses and frontal zones in our case alk s becomes important in the northern part of the domain positive pco2 anomalies northward of 5 s in fig 4d given the linear relationship between alk and salinity the decrease in surface alk up to 10 the domain mean is attributed to the low salinities associated to different types of water masses such as the tropical and equatorial surface waters in the northern portion of the regional domain graco et al 2007 although we did not explicitly include river discharges in our simulations the signal of associated low salinities runoff influence is represented in our solutions through the climatological surface and lateral forcings the impact of fw may be neglected fig 4e note that a negative pco2 anomaly does not translate into a sink nature of co2 this is because the domain average pco2 p co 2 is 64 µatm above pco 2 air thus neither alk nor fw have the potential by themselves to reduce seawater pco2 below atmospheric levels from a regional scale perspective in the nearshore domain dic contributes with approximately 250 µatm to the total pco2 anomalies meanwhile t alk and fw tend to cancel the dic effect out reducing the domain average pco2 in approximately 97 22 and 1 7 µatm respectively this suggests that the effect of larger dic concentrations in increasing pco2 is up to three times larger than the effect of low sst in decreasing seawater pco2 in order to assess the contribution of the mechanisms behind the spatial gradient of the annual mean pco2 we now look at the results of the sensitivity experiments which are summarized in fig 5 note that instead of showing the spatial anomalies of pco2 due to the drivers as presented in fig 4 here we show the spatial net contribution of each mechanism to total pco2 p co 2 ctrl i mechanisms p co 2 i e the sum of fig 5b e results in fig 5a residuals o 10 13 if pco2 was solely controlled by the circulation physics a pattern similar to fig 5b would be observed on average seawater pco2 reaches values up to 874 µatm due to circulation alone i e the physical transport and mixing of dic and alk the contribution of biology fig 5c is negative nearly everywhere and its average value is 337 µatm this biologically driven pco2 drawdown turns out to be higher further offshore and also within the coastal band south of 17 s the spatial decoupling between the area of maximum upwelling and regions where the biological effect is maximum as shown in fig 5c may be attributed to i the upward transport and mixing of dic and nutrients that are biologically taken up and subsequently exported as organic matter sarmiento and gruber 2006 ii incomplete utilization of upwelled macro nutrients friederich et al 2008 because nitrate is not efficiently used due to iron limitation gruber et al 2009 iii high levels of mesoscale activity that export nutrients offshore gruber et al 2011 where the full potential of biological drawdown of co2 is achieved lachkar and gruber 2011 2013 turi et al 2014 as a consequence the air sea co2 fluxes are not spatially balanced in the nhcs because the nutrient limitation turn out to be high with a relatively low nutrient use efficiency particularly in some important upwelling centers along the peruvian coast mogollón and calil 2018 this low degree of biological compensation implies a sluggish biological pump in the upwelling region of the nhcs which in turns explains the high pco2 values found in the 100 km wide coastal strip and the associated strong co2 outgassing in contrast turi et al 2014 explains that the air sea co2 fluxes in the california current system are essentially balanced due to the highly efficient biological pump in the region i e a net release of co2 in the nearshore band is largely compensated by a net biologically driven uptake of co2 in the offshore region the contribution of the processes affecting co2 solubility fig 5d closely resembles that of temperature see fig 4b this is because of the stronger dependence of co2 solubility on sst than on salinity the solubility driven contribution accounts on average for 19 µatm the contribution of the air sea co2 flux is negative in the central part of the domain in the nhcs see fig 5e evidencing a negative contribution of the gas exchange to total seawater pco2 i e total dic loss through outgassing on average the air sea co2 fluxes contribute to a decrease of seawater pco2 of approximately 95 µatm note that the spatial gradient of air sea co2 flux resembles the annual mean pco2 pattern fig 4a since it is directly tied to regions where the nhcs acts as a source or sink of atmospheric co2 3 4 temporal variability of domain mean pco2 here we focus on the temporal variability of pco2 by investigating the drivers and mechanisms on monthly and seasonal time scales to this end we proceed as in section 3 3 but now considering a domain average of each driver or mechanism the decomposition of the pco2 anomalies into individual contributions for both drivers and mechanisms was applied once for the regional domain the temporal variability for the regional domain and for a subset nearshore domain was analyzed separately additional estimates of the net contribution of each mechanism to the total pco2 instead of pco2 anomalies may be found in appendix a2 for both domains and on seasonal time scales fig 6 a and b show the monthly mean contributions of the four drivers to the total pco2 anomalies for the regional and nearshore domain respectively the associated seasonal contribution is also presented as a bar diagram in fig 6c and d dic s and t are the most important drivers in both domains exhibiting larger amplitudes and they both tend to cancel each other out along the year specifically for the regional domain the pco2 variations driven by dic s tend to diminish and increase pco2 during the first and second half of the year respectively the temperature driven variations follow the seasonal cycle of warming and cooling exhibiting an opposite seasonality to dic s this is more evident in the bar diagram where each driver is highlighted with its seasonal contribution fig 6c in the nearshore domain fig 6b the purely dic driven pco2 anomalies follow the seasonal cycle of the upwelling intensity these dic s driven pco2 variations are always large 250 µatm on average particularly during winter 400 µatm in contrast persistently low sst during all seasons in the upwelling region induces a decrease in pco2 of approximately 96 µatm with a maximum during winter 176 µatm and a minimum during late spring summer 24 µatm overall pco2 is more sensitive to changes in dic than sst in a proportion varying from 2 1 to 4 1 depending on the season fig 6d the seasonal cycle of the alk s driven component has a minor influence on the simulated pco2 for both regions within the regional domain alk s appears to be phase lagged by about 2 months with dic s or t exhibiting a minimum negative anomalies during fall and a maximum positive anomalies during spring this phase shift occurs because alkalinity follows the seasonal cycle of salinity which is also 2 months out of phase with sst on a regional scale in contrast in the nearshore domain alk s driven variations induce a yearlong decrease in pco2 of approximately 22 µatm pco2 variations driven by fw may be neglected for both domains not shown as in the case of the spatial analysis in order to quantify the role of each mechanism in controlling the temporal pco2 variability fig 7 a and b show the temporal fluctuations around 19 874 337 95 and 461 µatm for co2 solubility circulation biology air sea co2 flux and control pco2 respectively by doing so the sum of all individual contributions of the four mechanisms to the pco2 anomalies i e the solid black lines control are the same as in figs 6 and 7 biologically driven pco2 variations follow the so called paradoxical cycle of the surface chlorophyll pennington et al 2006 echevin et al 2008 which is inversely proportional to the intensity of the upwelling thus despite the increased upwelling during winter the nhcs becomes less productive mogollón and calil 2018 in contrast biological production is enhanced during summer fall leading to a stronger biological compensation for both domains for the regional domain fig 7a and c co2 solubility follows the seasonal annual cycle of warming and cooling as it is strongly influenced by changes in temperature the seasonal variations in circulation contribute to a lesser degree to the seasonal pco2 variability while the contribution from the air sea co2 fluxes is negligible however for the nearshore domain see fig 7b and d circulation clearly dominates the seasonal variations in co2 solubility due to persistently low sst play an important role on dampening the effect of circulation in all seasons however based on our simulations this thermal solubility compensation accounts for approximately half of the circulation effect this is consistent with the compensating effect between dic s and t as observed in the analysis of the drivers seasonal variations in air sea co2 fluxes act reducing the overall amplitude of the seasonal pco2 variability but with a smaller contribution than the other three mechanisms fig 7d finally if we sum each individual net contribution from all the mechanisms acting on pco2 within the nearshore domain the resulting seawater pco2 will be 100 280 µatm larger than atmospheric values depending on the season of the year see appendix a2 this positive difference pco 2 sea pco 2 air 0 is the reason why the highly productive upwelling region of the nhcs is a source of atmospheric co2 4 summary and conclusions in this work a series of model simulations were performed using a coupled physical biogeochemical model in order to assess the drivers and mechanisms that control seawater pco2 and associated air sea co2 fluxes in the nhcs in a climatological sense our results demonstrate the strong source nature of the region with an averaged flux of 1 91 0 71 mol c m 2 year 1 which represents an integrated outgassing carbon flux of 0 07 pg c year 1 almost 15 of the entire equatorial pacific this source behaviour is caused by the combination of the upwelling of dic rich waters and an inefficient biological pump in the humboldt ebus previous studies in the california ebus turi et al 2014 lachkar and gruber 2013 show that the high degree of nutrient utilization and the implied high efficiency of the biological pump render the air sea co2 fluxes essentially balanced with a net release of co2 in the nearshore band which is compensated by a net biologically driven uptake of co2 in the offshore region they expect a similar behaviour in the canary ebus given the complete nutrient utilization there however our simulations suggest that this is not the case for the humboldt ebus we show that the low degree of biological compensation results from a spatial and temporal decoupling between the upward transport and mixing of dic and the downward export of organic matter as a consequence the area where the full potential of the biological drawdown of co2 is achieved is found further offshore which explains the high pco2 values found in the 100 km wide coastal strip the temporal decoupling is related to the so called paradoxical cycle of primary production which is opposite to the seasonal cycle of the upwelling intensity the contribution of gas exchange and the processes affecting co2 solubility play a minor role when compared to the ones associated with the biological pump circulation and biology the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the most important drivers are dics and temperature which exhibit opposing effects in controlling pco2 in the nearshore domain the effect of larger dic concentrations due to coastal upwelling in increasing pco2 is up to three times larger than the effect of low sst in decreasing seawater pco2 alk s driven pco2 variations could be neglected since their contribution is one order of magnitude smaller than that of dics similarly the impact of fw is negligible we found that the solubility driven pco2 variations associated with the seasonal warming and cooling of surface waters are nearly fully compensated by biology driven pco2 variations in the regional domain however in the nearshore domain circulation contributes most to the seasonal pco2 variability despite the importance of the nhcs measurements of pco2 along the peruvian coast are still rare this precludes a detailed analysis of a number of processes that affect pco2 variability such as the rapid sea surface warming and the iron limitation of primary production chavez et al 2007 friederich et al 2008 in addition the lack of high frequency pco2 observations does not allow a characterization of the short term variability of the co2 carbonate system which remains open to debate this is further complicated by the highly variable ocean circulation high levels of mesoscale activity and interannual to interdecadal variability feely et al 2006 landschützer et al 2014 for instance el niño southern oscillation enso contributes to the seawater pco2 variability by inducing changes in the thermocline depth wind patterns and consequently upwelling rates feely et al 1999 chavez et al 1999 wanninkhof et al 2013 rödenbeck et al 2014 although we made substantial progress in elucidating the most important contributors to seawater pco2 variability our model simulations did not contain nonseasonal variability such as enso another important caveat is related to the boundary conditions in particular dic and alk specifically the climatologies of these two important parameters of the co2 carbonate system were assumed to be invariant throughout the seasonal cycle in addition the eastern tropical pacific is heavily undersampled and underrepresented in glodap thus larger mapping errors associated with this gridded database could bias our results but not the overall conclusions our work is an initial step in order to understand the mechanisms that control co2 variability on a climatological basis it thus serves as a baseline in order to investigate the impact of future and contemporary climate change on the seawater co2 carbonate system and associated air sea co2 fluxes data availability the outputs of the low and high resolution control simulations 1 6 and 1 12

24071,a structure preserving discretization of ocean parametrizations on unstructured grids peter korn max planck institute for meteorology bundesstr 53 hamburg 20146 germany max planck institute for meteorology bundesstr 55 hamburg 20146 germany a structure preserving discretization of the isoneutral diffusion of redi and of the eddy induced skew diffusion scheme of gent and mcwilliams on unstructured grids is described the discretization is based on a variational principle and its essential element is a construction of a discrete hilbert space by means of admissible vector reconstructions these reconstructions are applied to discretize the isoneutral slopes as the key component of the parametrizations through the discrete scalar product of the hilbert space for the tracers we are able to represent isoneutral mixing tensor and eddy advection in weak form and to prove that the resulting discrete algorithm preserves essential physical properties of the continuous operator the discretization follows in principle the established variational and skew flux approach but implements these concepts via a natural extension of the discretization of the dynamical core of the unstructured grid ocean model icon o the theoretical analysis is supplemented by numerical experiments that illustrate that the discretization indeed implements the functionality of isoneutral diffusion and skew diffusion as complementary parameterizations of unresolved mesoscale eddy effects keywords ocean parametrization isoneutral diffusion eddy advection skew diffusion structure preserving discretization 1 introduction the mesoscale eddy advection of gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 and the isoneutral diffusion due to redi 1982 form cornerstones of modern global ocean general circulation models virtually every global ocean general circulation model based on vertical z coordinates relies on these subgrid scale closures isoneutral diffusion is motivated by the observational evidence that mixing in the ocean takes place predominantly within isoneutral surface and that the mixing across isoneutral surfaces is by orders of magnitude smaller a physical argument supporting this statment can be found in mcdougall et al 2014 this oriented mixing process has to be parametrized by ocean models using a z coordinate the parametrized eddy advection intends to capture the behavior of mesoscale eddies to advect tracers by an eddy induced transport velocity that complements the large scale transport velocity and to reduce potential energy by flattening isoneutral surfaces gent et al 1995 the two ocean parametrizations remove essential model biases and deficiencies of z coordinate models such as the veronis effect see the overview in gent 2011 in this work we use the names isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection as identifiers to discriminate between two different operators one of diffusive type and one of advective nature isoneutral mixing and eddy advection both have been formulated for the continuous ocean equations their discretization poses a challenging numerical problem for ocean models that rely on a staggered distribution of variables on the grid a solution to the discretization problem was provided in two landmark papers by griffies et al 1998 griffies 1998 in these papers a functional variational formalism for ocean models on structured grids was developed that implements a physically consistent discretization of both parametrizations recently a variant and a generalization to biharmonic isoneutral diffusion was suggested in lemarie et al 2012 the purpose of this paper is to enrich the existing spatial discretizations of eddy advection and isoneutral diffusion and to introduce within the general systematic of a functional variational formalism an alternative discretization of eddy advection and isoneutral diffusion on unstructured grids the discretization presented here has evolved naturally from the discretization methodology for the ocean primitive equations on the triangular arakawa c grid that was developed for the ocean general circulation model icon o model korn 2017 icon o formulates the discrete ocean equations in weak form and relies on admissible reconstructions to create a discrete hilbert space structure it is the discrete hilbert space property that we exploit here for the spatial discretization of eddy parametrization and isoneutral diffusion having a discrete hilbert space allows to formulate the tracer equations in a weak variational form see e g hughes 1997 and this form of the equations establishes a natural link to the functional variational formalism of griffies et al 1998 griffies 1998 2004 ocean general circulation models that are based on finite element methodology such as fesom 1 wang et al 2014 do also directly explore the weak variational form to implement the two parametrizations for such models the discretization problem is facilitated through the use of continuous finite element galerkin basis functions that create the discrete hilbert space structure in its recent finite volume version fesom 2 danilov et al 2017 variable staggering and numerical method have been changed now without galerkin basis functions eddy advection and isoneutral diffusion are discretized via the functional formalism of griffies et al 1998 griffies 1998 with a form of triad interpolation that is adapted to the unstructured fesom 2 grid see appendix d in danilov et al 2017 for general background on unstructured grid ocean modelling with a focus on the discretization of the dynamical core we refer to danilov 2013 2012 ringler et al 2013 the core idea of the variational functional formalism of griffies et al 1998 griffies 2004 for the discretization of the isoneutral mixing tensor is to associate to the laplacian mixing operator a unique functional whose derivative equals the laplacian 1 1 the mathematical relation between self adjoint and positive semi definite operators and functionals is known as the dirichlet principle see e g evans 1998 the ingenious contribution of griffies et al 1998 is to discretize the functional instead of the laplace operator and then take the functional derivative of the discrete functional to derive a consistent discretization of the isoneutral mixing operator this discretization diminishes variance and avoids artificial buoyancy fluxes and thereby fixes an instability problem of previous discretizations the discretization of the above mentioned functional takes place by means of the so called triad interpolation see griffies et al 1998 sect 5 b the eddy advection of gent mcwilliams is then included by interpreting this advective closure as a skew flux this results in a coherent and computationally efficient discretization of both ocean parametrizations we pursue here an inherent unstructured grid approach for the discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection our strategy is not to translate genuine structured grids concepts to unstructured grids although this is possible in our approach we remain in the variational functional framework that associates an operator and a functional and we emphasize the equivalent viewpoint that this functional can by virtue of the riesz representation theorem see e g reed and simon 1980 be identified with a scalar product and a norm the so called energy norm scalar products give rise to geometric notion and the language of the isoneutral and eddy parametrization is inherently geometric the scalar product notion has the advantage that it is also intimately linked to the concept of weak or variational solutions this work follows the geometric and scalar product based perspective we show how a scalar product on a staggered unstructured grid can be realized by means of the reconstructions that are necessitated by the differing location of horizontal and vertical tracer gradients the reconstruction operators considered here belong to the class of admissible reconstructions introduced in korn 2017 that are used in the discretization of the dynamcial core of icon o these reconstructions implement the scalar product and constitute the essential building block for the discretization of the mixing tensor another essential requirement is the duality of discrete divergence and gradient operators korn 2017 the resulting discrete scheme for both parametrizations can also be formulated on arbitrarily shaped polygons such as hexagonal or rectangular grid cells we prove by theoretical analysis that the so obtained discretization preserves essential mathematical and physical structures of the continuous parametrizations such as balance of buoyancy fluxes and tracer variance reduction for the isoneutral diffusion and skewness of the eddy fluxes in this sense is our discretizatio structure preserving these theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments the numerical evidence is provided by dedicated idealized experiments that allow to study a specific property in isolation and by a global ocean simulation that shows our new discretization within a general circulation model we emphasize that we do not address some important aspects of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection such as the physical realism of these parametrization see e g von storch et al 2016 or the problem of parameter choice see e g eden and greatbatch 2008 these relevant problems are not addressed here instead we focus on the problem of spatial discretization and of how to transfer essential mathematical physical properties of the mixing tensor from a continuous to a discrete model set up structure of the paper section 2 reviews mesoscale eddy parametrization and isoneutral diffusion in the continuous setting and highlights the essential mathematical and physical properties these properties are used in section 4 as a constrain for our structure preserving discretization of isoneutral mixing tensor and eddy advection we prove that essential mathematical and physical properties are retained by the discretization in sect 5 we provide experimental evidence that confirm the validity of or approach where sect 5 2 is dedicated to idealized experiments and sect 5 3 gives an impression of the behavior of the parametrizations in a global ocean simulation the work presented here complements the description of the dynamical core korn 2017 of the ocean component icon o within the icon modelling system icon is a joint project of the max planck institute for meteorology and the german weather service 2 isoneutral diffusion and mesoscale eddy advection in the continuous setting in the skew flux formalism denote by c either potential temperature or salinity c θ s the advection diffusion for the tracer evolution is given by 1 c t d i v 3 c v d c with d c d i v f s g s c where d denotes a general dissipative operator and where the subgrid scale flux f s g s c consists of two parts the isoneutral diffusive flux and the mesoscale eddy advection of gent mcwilliams 2 f s g s c f i s o c f g m c k i s o k g m c the tracer boundary conditions on the surface boundary ωs bottom boundary ωb and

bottom boundary fluxes of tracer c in this work we will always use a vanishing bottom boundary flux we use in our experiments in sect 5 a zero surface flux in idealized experiments and a nonvanishing surface flux of potential temperature and salinity for the global ocean simulation the two tracers potential temperature θ and salinity s determine together with the pressure p through the equation of state the ocean density 6 ρ ρ θ s p in this work we use as thermodynamic description potential temperature salinity and pressure replacing potential temperature θ by the more accurate conservative temperature ioc 2010 olbers et al 2012 would potentially improve our results but would not require changes to the spatial discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection that is presented here 2 1 isoneutral diffusion tensor the purpose of the isoneutral diffusion is to mimic the behavior of the real ocean by orientating the diffusing of ocean tracers preferably along locally neutral directions and to a much smaller extend perpendicular to the neutral direction the neutral direction is the local direction of neutral buoyancy the direction perpendicular to the neutral direction is the dianeutral direction mathematically this can be expressed either as a projection along the isoneutral dianeutral directions or equivalently as a coordinate rotation of the diffusive tracer flux parallel to the neutral direction see griffies 2004 olbers et al 2012 this leads to the isoneutral diffusion tensor as introduced in redi 1982 the isoneutral slopes l l h 0 lx ly 0 in 9 form a central concept of isoneutral diffusion as well as of the eddy advection see sect 2 2 the slopes are defined by 7 l h α h θ β h s α z θ β z s with coefficients of thermal expansion and haline contraction given by 8 α ρ θ s p c o n s t β ρ s θ p c o n s t where the derivatives in 8 are taken at constant s p for α and at constant θ p for β the observation that isoneutral surfaces are typically only mildly inclined justifies the small slope approximation the isoneutral diffusion tensor in this small slope approximation is given by 9 k i s o k i 1 0 l x 0 1 l y l x l y ϵ l 2 with ϵ k d k i 1 the fraction of dianeutral and isoneutral diffusivity the corresponding isoneutral flux with horizontal component f i s o h and vertical component f i s o v reads as follows 10 f i s o f i s o h f i s o v with 11 f i s o h c k i h c l h z c f i s o v c k i l h h c ϵ l 2 z c an important relation between the isoneutral tracer flux and the neutral component of the dianeutral tracer flux obtained by choosing kd 0 is given by 12 f i s o v c l h f i s o h c in numerical ocean simulations the dianeutral parameter kd is often set to zero because the dianeutral direction is in the small slop is approximation nearly identical with the vertical direction and the dianeutral mixing is then subsumed with vertical mixing processes 2 2 eddy advection the eddy advection approximates the eddy transport by a so called eddy induced velocity v such that v c v c where the overbar denotes a generic mean and the primed variables refer to fluctuations around this mean the eddy induced velocity is determined from a stream function ψ 13 v c u r l ψ and the stream function depends linearly on the slope 14 ψ z κ l here κ 0 is the coefficient of the eddy advection often also called thickness diffusivity in the advective formulation the eddy induced velocity v is added to the transport velocity in the skew flux formalism griffies 1998 the anti symmetric gent mcwilliams matrix is used given by 15 k g m κ 0 0 l x 0 0 l y l x l y 0 a simple direct calculation shows that the skew flux formalism and the advective formulation are equivalent if one uses the tracer transport in conservative form as it is usual then the skew flux form has the numerical advantage that one applies one derivative less to the slopes than the advective version of the eddy advection this reduces the computational noise of the eddy advection if we apply the gent mcwilliams eddy tensor 15 to the tracer gradient we obtain the flux 16 f g m h c κ l h z c f g m v c κ l h h c the combination of isoneutral diffusion 11 and eddy advection 16 gives the following formula which shows how both parametrizations can be combined by means of the respective iso dianeutral and eddy coefficients 17 f i s o g m h c k i h c k i κ l z c f i s o g m v c k i κ l h c k d k i l 2 z c 2 3 essential physical properties the original paper by gent and mcwilliams 1990 and the analysis of griffies et al 1998 griffies 1998 see also griffies 2004 contain the following set of properties of the two ocean parametrization under consideration these properties constitute a set of necessary conditions it induces the structure that we want to preserve by the discretization isoneutral diffusion is positive semi definite 18 ω c k i s o c d x 0 c isoneutral diffusion satisfied the following balance 19 α f i s o t

eq 1 for potential temperature and salinity c θ s with the tracer itself and integrate over the global domain ω assuming no flux homogeneous neumann boundary conditions then we obtain for the time evolution of tracer variance 1 2 d d t ω c 2 d x ω f s g s c c d x now we focus on the isoneutral diffusion operator f s g s c f i s o and derive with the specific form 10 11 of f i s o that cf sect 3b in griffies et al 1998 21 1 2 d d t ω c 2 d x ω f i s o c c d x ω k i s o c c d x 22 ω k i e 1 c 2 e 2 c 2 k d e 3 c 2 d x 23 ω k i c 2 ρ c 2 k d ρ c 2 d x where the isoneutral dianeutral coordinates e e 1 e 2 e 3 are defined as 24 e 1 z ρ z ρ e 2 e 1 e 3 e 3 ρ with the unit vector in dianeutral direction given by 25 ρ α θ β s α θ β s from the equation for the tracer variance 22 we observe that isoneutral diffusion does not increase the global tracer variance because the integrand in 22 is non negative eq 23 provides more information two of the three terms of the integrand are negative and contribute to a reduction of variance the second term under the integral 23 is positive and potentially adds variance but the amount of added variance is majorized by the first positive term if the tracer gradient is oriented in direction of dianeutral unit vector ρ the whole isoneutral term in 23 vanishes because the two terms in the first bracket cancel in this case the dianeutral term attains his maximal value since the isoneutral diffusion does not increase the tracer gradient the isoneutral flux is oriented down the gradient such that f i s o c 0 2 3 2 evolution of density for linear equation of state continuous case the balance property 19 is valid for a general equation of state if we assume the specific case of a linear equation of state then 19 implies that the isoneutral flux of density vanishes and that consequently the isoneutral diffusion does not change the density this can be seen as follows for a linear equation of state ρ α θ β s with α β 0 differentiation of ρ with respect to time yields 26 ρ t α θ t β s t d i v α f i s o θ β f i s o s d i v f i s o ρ 0 for a nonlinear equation of state the balance property 19 remains valid a consequence of nonlinear effects such as cabbeling thermobaricity and halobaricity that generate irreversible mixing the balance property 19 does no longer imply that the density remains unchanged see e g chpt 12 1 7 in griffies 2004 nevertheless does 19 couple the isoneutral fluxes of potential temperature and salinity and the preservation of this property on the discrete level plays an instrumental role in preventing grid noise a sensible translation of the properties above from the continuous equations to the discrete setting is fundamental for a stable numerical algorithm the properties 18 20 define the structure that we aim to preserve by our discretization of the isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection operators the topics of sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 will be discussed on the discrete level in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 3 discrete tracer equations and admissible reconstructions in this section we provide the relevant context on the discrete tracer advection and diffusion equations this introduces also the methodological basis for the discretization of the parametrizations the complete discretization framework for the ocean primitive equations used in the ocean general citculation model icon o and is without the ocean parametrizations described in korn 2017 in icon o the advection diffusion equation of the oceanic tracer transport is discretized in weak variational form and reads as follows for all test functions ψ h c it holds that 27 d c d t ψ h c div p g t c p g v ψ h c d z c w ψ h c div f s g s h c ψ h c d z f s g s v c ψ h c this work focuses on the sub grid scale term f s g s c f s g s h c f s g s v c in order explain the discretization of this term we define in the following the grid g sect 3 1 the tracer space h c k and the scalar product bracket sect 3 2 the discrete differential operators div d z d z sect 3 3 and relevant horizontal and vertical reconstruction operators sect 3 4 the weak or variational form of the discrete equations interprets the equation in an averaged or weighted sense where the weights are given by the test functions weak forms of equations form the basis of finite volume and finite element schemes see e g hughes 1997 they are also standard in mathematical hydrodynamics see e g foias et al 2001 a physical oriented interpretation of weak forms in hydrodynamics can be found in sect 2 2 of whitham 1974 and the relation in mechanics between weak form and the principle of virtual power is discussed in dautray and lions 2000 see chpt 1 3 of the appendix in our method the test functions are given by piecewise constant functions this corresponds to a finite volume approach and the bracket h c to a discrete volume integral that by means of the divergence theorem is converted into a surface integral we emphasize the additional property of the bracket h c to constitute a scalar product more common to finite element methods because this provides a geometric interpretation that turns out to be useful in the discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection 3 1 the grid the icosahedral grid that we are using is derived from the icosahedron the platonic solid that is inscribed into a sphere such that north and south poles are connected both to vertices of a triangle the 20 equilateral triangles of the icosahedron are then subdivided through a bi section of the great circle arcs that create the triangle edges the new points located halfway between the existing triangle vertices are introduced as new vertices and are connected through great circle lines that constitute the new edges such that each triangular cell is subdivided into four sub triangles this process is repeated until we reach the desired grid resolution fig 1 shows an example of the final grid the naming conventions for grid quantities are listed in table 1 the horizontal grid is composed from grid cells identified with their circumcenter for the edge orientation we use the following conventions each edge ek has a normal vector n e k the two neighboring cells kk lk of the edge e k k k l k are connected by e k and ordered in a way such that the vector x k k x l k points in the direction of the edge normal associated with the outer normal we define the indicator function n e k k that takes the value 1 1 if n e k k is the outer inner normal of kk to each edge ek we assign a tangential vector t e k such that n e k t e k z e k where z e k is the unit vector pointing upward at the edge midpoint ek the corresponding indicator function is t e k k k for the vertical grid we use a z coordinate and the two dimensional grid quantities are simply extended by a third height based dimension we refer to three dimensional cells as prisms we denote the vertical coordinate levels by zk with k 1 n z the top layer carries the index k 1 and k increases downward the number of vertical levels depends on the topography and varies from cell to cell n z n z k definition 1 grid definition i the set of all cells at level k 1 n z is denoted by c k the set of edge midpoints at level k is denoted by e k ii the grid g is composed of a union of three dimensional prisms with triangular base element that tessellate the computational domain ω 28 g k 1 n z k c k k such that g ω the discrete lateral boundary g l of the domain ω is described as the union of the set of edges at level k g l k 1 n z g k with g k e k k k l k e k exactly one of the cells k k l k adjacent to edge e k is a land cell and one is a water cell 3 2 discrete spaces on the grid described in the previous section we model tracers such as potential temperature and salinity as discrete functions that are piecewise constant within a grid cell in this section we define the discrete functions spaces including scalar products norms and boundary conditions the space h c k of tracers at interior vertical level k 1 n z is defined as 29 h c k p c k r p k k p k k here c k denotes the set of all cell centers at level k kk a generic cell at level k the tracer space h c k is endowed with the volume weighted scalar product 30 p k 1 p k 2 h c k k c k k δ z k k p k k 1 p k k 2 for all p 1 p 2 h c k where kk denotes the area of cell kk at level k whose product with the level thickness δz k k result in the cell volume the horizontal diffusive fluxes of potential temperature and salinity are on the discrete level described by functions that are defined on cell edges and constant along an edge the function space is given by 31 h e k v e k r v e v e k satisfies tracer boundary conditions 46 and supplement it with a scalar product 32 v 1 v 2 h e k e e k e δ z k e e v e 1 v e 2 for all v 1 v 2 h e k lateral boundary conditions are specified on the primal grid and the discrete analogue of the no normal flux boundary condition at an edge of the boundary is v e n e 0 where ne denotes the normal vector at edge e diffusive vertical fluxes that at the top of a three dimensional computational prism in the ocean interior indexed by k 1 2 with k 1 n z 1 are described by the space 33 h c k 1 2 p c k 1 2 r p k k 1 2 p k k 1 2 analogously we define diffusive vertical fluxes that at the bottom of a three dimensional grid cell by 34 h c k 1 2 p c k 1 2 r p k k 1 2 p k k 1 2 by h c k 1 2 we denote the vertical fluxes at top and bottom of a cell at level k k 1 n z 1 for the surface level k 1 2 we set 35 h c 1 2 p c 1 2 r p k 1 2 p k 1 2 satisfies tracer boundary conditions 44 and for the bottom level 36 h c n z 1 2 p c n z 1 2 r p k n z 1 2 p k n z 1 2 satisfies tracer boundary conditions 45 the specification of the discrete boundary condition 44 46 is given once the discrete differential operators are introduces and can be found at the end of sect 3 3 all spaces 33 36 are supplemented by a scalar product the scalar products for these spaces are defined as a volume weighted scalar product analogously to 30 with the vertical thickness δz k k replaced by the distance between coordinate levels δ z k 1 2 for mathematical reasons that will appear in the discretization of the isoneutral slopes we define spaces for vectors that are constant on cells h c k p c k r 3 p k k p k k and supplement it with the scalar product 37 p 1 p 2 h c k k c k k δ z k k p k 1 p k 2 for all p 1 p 2 h c k here denotes the euclidian scalar product in r 3 the associated global spaces h c h c h c that cover not only individual levels but the whole domain are composed as union of the spaces h c k h c k and h c k 1 2 38 h c k 1 n z h c k and h c k 1 n z h c k 1 2 h c 1 2 h c n z 1 2 and for the vectors h c k 1 n z h c k the respective global scalar products are extend by a summation of 30 and 37 over all vertical levels 3 3 discrete differential operators after having defined the grid and the discrete functions on this grid we introduce the discrete differential operators for this definitions we use the function spaces h e k h c k of the previous section and the notation for the grid of sect 3 1 the discrete divergence operator div relies on gauss divergence theorem and is as follows for f h e k we define the discrete horizontal divergence div h e k h c k by 39 div f k k 1 k δ z k k e k f e k e n e k δ z e k note that we did not assume a particular cell shape such as a triangular cell the divergence definition applies to general polygonal cells the discrete horizontal gradient in normal edge direction grad h is a mapping grad h h c k h e k that is defined implicitly by 40 div f g h c k f grad g h e k for all f h e k g h c k this satisfies by definition a discrete integration by parts relation the boundary contribution in 40 vanishes due to the no flux boundary condition the definition of the discrete differential operators is completed by vertical differential operators for a cell based field f h c k we define this differential operator between vertical coordinate levels k 1 n z 1 by 41 d z h c k h c k 1 2 f d z f k k 1 2 f k k f k k 1 δ z k 1 2 and analogous operator between half levels 42 d z h c 1 2 h c k 1 2 f d z f k k f k k 1 2 f k k 1 2 δ z k the two operators are related via a vertical integration by parts rule for all f h c g h c it holds that 43 d z f k g k h c f k 1 2 d z g k 1 2 h c k c f k 1 2 g k 1 k c f k n z 1 2 g k n z this global relation can also be formulated locally i e for a single fluid column of one cell across all vertical levels discrete boundary conditions with the discrete differential operators we can define the discrete boundary conditions that correspond to 3 5 44 k i s o d z c k 1 2 q t o p c at top boundary 45 d z c k n z q b o t t o m c at bottom boundary 46 grad c e 0 at edges e g 3 4 admissible reconstructions on a staggered grid the discretization of isopycnal slopes requires horizontal and vertical reconstructions because horizontal and vertical gradients occurring in the slope definition reside at different grid locations we use here the concept of admissible reconstructions introduced in korn 2017 and korn 2018 we fill focus on the elements of the theory that are relevant for us and refer for a complete treatment to the two papers above we define generic linear operators between the discrete spaces introduced in sect 3 2 after describing necessary properties of these operators we give a particular example at the end of this section first we need an operator that reconstructs from normal edge components of a triangle the full cell centered vector 47 p g h e k h c k v p g v an example of such a horizontal reconstruction is the perot reconstruction perot 2000 with a modification to include variable topography kleptsova et al 2009 given by 48 p g h e k h c k v p g v k k 1 k z k k e k v e e d e k n e k δ z e k where d e k denotes the distance between midpoint of edge e k and cell circumcenter k and n e k n e k ne the outward pointing normal vector at edge e with respect to cell k to the generic reconstruction 47 we assign the transposed operator p g t with respect to the scalar products inf h e k and h c k defined by p g v φ h c k v p g t φ h e k for v h e k φ h c k the transposed operator maps in the opposite direction 49 p g t h c k h e k for the perot reconstruction 48 the transposed perot operator is given by the transposed operator that creates from two vectors at cell centers a normal vector component at the common edge is given by p g t h c k h e k f p g t f k l k 1 k l f k d e k f l d e l n k l if k l g 0 if k l g where gk denotes the set of boundary edges at level k the difference is ordered such that the direction from xk to xl coincides with the normal n k l at the edge k l note that the mappings p g p g t do not operate between spaces of the same dimension and are therefore not invertible the operators above will be used as building blocks to construct a symmetric positive definite operator for the weak form relevant to us are reconstructions that satisfy the following properties 2 2 the complete definition of admissible reconstruction in korn 2017 involves also a condition on the reconstruction used for the coriolis term and a filtering property for the spurious triangular c grid mode this is not relevant for our purpose here 1 p g reproduces constants in the following sense suppose v k r 3 is a constant vector in cell k its normal projections are v e v k n e with n e the normal vectors at edges e k of k then p g reconstructs the normal projections p g v k n e v k n e 2 p g t provides an unique and first order accurate flux at triangular edges we apply an analogous approach for the required reconstructions q g in the vertical direction the situation is here simplified by the fact that we use in the vertical a non uniform but one dimensional grid and that we need to deal with scalar and not vector quantities for the vertical reconstructions q g we impose that 50 q g h c k 1 2 h c k and its transpose q g t h c k h c k 1 2 satisfy the following properties 1 q g reproduce constants suppose w k k r is constant in cell kk with values w k k 1 2 h c k 1 2 at top and bottom of the cell then q g reconstructs the original w q g w k k w k k 2 q g t provides unique and first order accurate fluxes at the top bottom of a cell the vertical reconstruction operator from the top and bottom of a triangular prism to the middle is for k 1 n z defined as 51 q g h c k 1 2 h c k f q g f k k 1 2 z k z k k 1 2 f k k 1 2 z k k 1 2 f k k 1 2 the transposed operator is for k 1 n z 1 given by q g t h c k h c k 1 2 g q g t g k k 1 2 1 2 g k k g k k 1 k c 1 g k 1 δ z 1 2 2 k k c n z g k n z z k n z 1 2 2 k for the top of the first layer we set q g t g k 1 2 0 for all k k 4 structure preserving discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection 4 1 isoneutral slope discretization the eddy advection of gent mcwilliams as well as the isoneutral diffusion rely on the concept of the slope vector the slope describes the ratio between local horizontal change versus the vertical change of buoyancy see 7 by its nature the slope is a vector the difficulty of the slope discretization is due to the fact that the corresponding horizontal and vertical derivatives of the tracers are associated with different locations of the cell boundary horizontal derivatives with cell edges at the middle of a three dimensional cell prism and vertical derivatives with the cell centers and at top bottom of cell prism thus one has to decide first where the discrete slope vector is located and second which quantities have to be interpolated by which method these choices are consequential for the quantities that depend on the slope such as fluxes of isoneutral dianeutral mixing and the preservation of the mathematical structure described in sect 2 3 we choose to position the slopes at the center of a three dimensional computational prism and interpolate the derivatives to this location by means of admissible reconstructions described in the previous section our discretization is in form of a definition given by definition 2 discrete slope operator the discrete slope operator l d is defined as 52 l d h c k h c k h c k θ s l d l d θ s α p g grad h θ β p g grad h s α q g d z θ β q g d z s the discrete slope operator takes scalars θ and s at prism centers and produces a vector at prism centers the vector character of the slopes stems from the p g in the numerator the denominator contains a scalar calculation of thermal expansion α and haline contraction coefficients β the reference point for the thermodynamical coefficients are the cell centers i e α β h c k at those points the coefficients are multiplied with the reconstructed gradients of temperature and salinity the calculation of the thermodynamical coefficients can be done directly from the definitions α ρ θ and β ρ s in the numerical experiments in sect 5 we use for computational efficiency the less costly equations of state from mcdougall 1987 that allows an analytical differentiation see also sect 5c in griffies et al 1998 4 2 discrete form of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection the discrete iso dianeutral fluxes are required on the boundary of a three dimensional prism i e at edges at middle level of the prism and at center of a cell at top bottom of prism this is mandated by the subsequent application of the divergence operator to these fluxes based on the discrete slope calculation 52 we discretize now the building blocks of the continuous isoneutral fluxes in 11 by the following dictionary 53 continuous discrete l z c l d q g d z c l h c l d p g grad h c l 2 z c l d 2 q g d z c we see that the discrete differential expressions grad h c dz c are mapped to the position of the slope vector l d with these elements we can aggregate the following discrete counterparts of the continuous isoneutral flux calculation 11 54 f i s o h c p g t k i p g grad h c l d q g d z c f i s o v c q g t k i l d p g grad h c l d 2 q g d z c q g t k d q d z c the transposed operators in front of the expressions above transforms a vector into a normal component at edges it guarantee that the flux lives on cell edges or top bottom of a cell such that the discrete divergence can act on it the vector valued part of the isoneutral fluxes at cell centers are defined by 55 f i s o h c k i p g grad h c l d q g d z c and f i s o v c k i l d p g grad h c l d 2 q g d z c k d q g d z c and is related to the flux across an edge by f i

discrete equivalent to the continuous relation 12 the accuracy with which this relation is satisfied by the model code determines the degree of isoneutrality of the scheme for the eddy advection an

parameters are functions k i k d κ h c k that are positive and bounded in this work we focus on the constant coefficient case 4 3 properties of structure preserving discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection in this section we prove that the discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection that was introduced in the previous section preserves the essential mathematical and physical structures of the continuous system that were described in sect 2 3 theorem 1 properties of discrete parametrization let p g q g be admissible horizontal and vertical reconstruction operators respectively as described in sect 3 4 denote by c θ s either potential temperature or salinity then the flux discretization of the isoneutral diffusion 54 and the mesoscale eddy advection of gent mcwilliams 57 together with the slope discretization 52 satisfy the following properties 1 the discrete isoneutral diffusion operator with fluxes given by 54 is positive semi

for c θ s and for all ϕ h e k we have according to 55 68 f i s o h c ϕ h e k f i s o h c p g ϕ h c k the terms in the balance relation 62 are for k g given by 69 α f i s o h θ k β f i s o h s k k i α p g grad h t β p g grad h s l d α q g d z t β q g d z s k and in order to prove 62 we have to show that the right hand side vanishes for the second term on the right hand side we observe from the definition of the discrete slope 52 that l d α q g d z θ β q g d z s α p g grad h θ β p g grad h s and since this cancels the first term on the right hand side of 69 it follows for all cells k c 70 α f i s o h θ k β f i s o h s k 0 the proof of the assertion for the horizontal part follows with 68 the statement for the vertical balance relation follows after an analogous calculation ad 3 the

downgradient diffusion if we multiply the discrete tracer eq 27 for c θ s by c i e choose ψ c in 27 integrate over the whole domain and assume no flux homogeneous neumann boundary conditions then we obtain the semi discrete equations for tracer variance 73 1 2 d d t c 2 1 h c div f i s o h c f g m h c c h c d z f i s o v c f g m v c c h c after discrete integration by parts cf 40 43 we have 74 1

this equation has a continuous analogue in eq 21 the two terms on the right hand side of 74 can be reformulated as follows cf eq 67 in the proof of part i of theorem 1 75 1 2 d d t c 2 1 h c k i l d q g d z c p g grad h c h c 2 k d q g d z c h c 2 this establishes that the discrete isoneutral fluxes 54 do not increase the global tracer variance this continuous property of the isoneutral diffusion operator is retained in the discrete setting cf sect 2 3 1 the last equation reads with 37 as follows 76 1 2 d d t k 1 n z k c k k δ z k c k k 2 77 k i k 1 n z k c k k δ z k l d q g d z c p g grad h c k 2 k d k 1 n z k c k k δ z k q g d z c k 2 78 k i k 1 n z k c k k δ z k l d q g d z c k 2 p g grad h c k 2 2 q g d z c l d p g grad h c k 79 k d k 1 n z k c k k δ z k q g d z c k 2 the expression on the right hand side describe the amount of tracer variance that leaves grid cell k due to isoneutral and dianeutral fluxes these fluxes are constructed by horizontal and vertical tracer derivatives grad c d z c at edges of k and the horizontal and vertical reconstructions p g q g applied to these derivatives this reconstructs the gradient vector at the center of the prism where the slope resides which neighboring cells are involved in the reconstruction depends on the stencils of p g and q g the stencil of the perot reconstructions that we use in our experiments in sect 5 see sect 3 4 consists for p g of the three edges of triangle k for the vertical derivative and its vertical reconstruction q g the stencil consists of the two cells above and below cell k the variance reduction 77 relies on the reformulation of fluxes on the right hand side of 75 where the continuous time variable enabled us to complete the square this is usually not possible with a discrete time variable because for stability reasons do time stepping schemes handle the potentially big l d 2 term in 77 in an implicit manner consequently the two terms in 77 that make up the square are evaluated at different time steps formally this questions the property of variance reduction on the discrete levels this is a well known feature see the discussion in griffies et al 1998 to which extend this conceptually unpleasant issue is also practically relevant in degrading the model integrity depends on the actual numerical experiment 4 3 2 discrete evolution of density for linear equation of state discrete case to assess the impact of the discrete isoneutral diffusion scheme on the density if irreversible mixing cabbeling thermobaricity and halobaricity is absent we assume a linear equation of state differentiating the linear equation of state with respect to time and then use the evolution equations for potential temperature and salinity yields ρ t k α k θ t k β k s t k α k div p g t f i s o h θ k β k div p g t f i s o h s k α k d z q g t f i s o v θ k β k d z q g t f i s o v s k div p g t α f i s o h θ β f i s o h s k d z q g t α f i s o v θ β f i s o v s k 0 where f i s o h f i s o v was defined in 55 and where in the last step the balance relation 62 was used thus the spatial discretization of the isoneutral diffusion tensor leaves the density invariant if the equation of state is linear this corresponds to the continuous property as discussed in section 2 3 2 remark 1 violation of discrete maximum principle for discretization of isoneutral diffusion using a nine point stencil the analysis in beckers et al 1998 2000 mathieu and delersnijder 1998 shows that there is no linear and consistent discretization that is also monotone i e that guarantees that maxima do not increase and minima do not decrease between subsequent time steps this can for structured grids be expressed as a simple sign condition on the coefficients of the discrete isoneutral diffusion matrix see eqs 19 and 20 in beckers et al 1998 we are not able to derive such a transparent condition for our discrete isoneutral diffusion matrix because the unstructured nature of our grid prevents a separation of the grid in one vertical and one horizontal direction on which the derivation in beckers et al 1998 was based the results of our numerical experiments in section 5 indicate that our discretization shows also a violation of the maximum principle it is unknown ff the occurrence of over undershoots is due to a fundamental incompatibility between consistency and monotonicity or if it is a consequence of the time stepping that does not preserve the variance reduction see sect 4 3 1 the presence of over undershoots is known to be problematic for passive tracers see e g gnanadesikan 2011 in the preceding discussion of properties of the new scheme for isoneutral diffusion and eddy parametrization we have not made use of specific geometric properties of the triangular grid the key ingredients were the duality of div and grad and the corresponding use of the dual reconstruction pairs p g p g t and q g q g t an inspection of the arguments of the proof of theorem 1 yield immediately the following corollary that extends theorem 1 to general grids corollary 1 isoneutral difusion eddy advection on general grids let g denote a grid of polygonal cells not necessarily of triangular shape with a c type staggering let the divergence and gradient be defined by 39 and 40 and let p g q g be admissible horizontal and vertical reconstructions then the assertions of theorem 1 remain valid 4 4 relation to standard variational formalism the variational formalism griffies et al 1998 for discretizing the isoneutral diffusion applies the relation between certain operators and associated functionals this relation known as dirichlet principle see for example evans 1998 states that a symmetric and positive definite operator a such as the laplace operator can be expressed as the derivative δ of a positive definite functional i c such that a δ i the equation a c f has a solution c 0 if and only if c 0 minimizes the functional i c a c c d x 2 f c d x based on these observations and in an attempt to explain and overcome deficiencies of a previous implementation an approach was suggested in griffies et al 1998 that discretizes the functional i c instead of the operator a and then proceed with the differentiation of the discrete functional with respect to the tracer value to derive the dicsrete form of the isoneutral mixing operator for the isoneutral diffusion the dissipation functional is given by griffies et al 1998 eqs 18 and 25 80 i c g c c with g c 1 c 2 1 2 ω c 1 k i s o c 2 d x where k i s o is given by 9 the dissipation functional can be expressed as 81 i c 1 2 ω k i c x l x c z 2 c y l y c z 2 k d c z 2 d x two aspects are important here first g defines a scalar product on the space of tracers the scalar product defined by the right hand side of 80 is equivalent to the scalar product of the sobolev space h 1 ω see e g evans 1998 second the scalar product 80 is nothing else than the weak form of the isoneutral diffusion operator in discretizing the dissipation functional i in 81 it was proposed in griffies et al 1998 to subdivide each rectangular grid cell m into 8 subcells m n 1 8 m n to each of these subcells a unique thermal and haline coefficient αn βn is associated as well as a isoneutral diffusion coefficient k i n and horizontal and vertical gradients of tracer and density this allows to formulate the discrete isoneutral dissipation functional as follows 82 i d c 1 2 m c n k i n m n δ x c l x d δ z c 2 m n δ y c l y d δ z c 2 m n k d δ z c 2 m n where δx δy δz denote the standard discrete finite difference in the respective coordinate direction the slope l l x l y 0 is discretized as 83 l x d α δ x θ β δ x s α δ z θ β δ z s l y d α δ y θ β δ y s α δ z θ β δ z s the essential physical properties of isoneutral diffusion and eddy parametrizaton in sect 2follow now from the variational approach and a consistent calculation of the slopes at subcells using the appropriate thermodynamical coefficients this formalism griffies et al 1998 can be applied also on unstructured grids provided the discretization of the dissipation functional is modified accordingly in our discretization we take a more direct route and use the fact that we have at hand 1 the tracer equations in weak variational form such that the discrete scalar product described above is already available and 2 that we have discrete differential operators div grad that are transposed to each other and 3 vector reconstructions p g q and transposed operators that preserve the scalar product 5 numerical experiments in this section we supplement the theoretical investigations of sect 4 3 of our new scheme for isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection by an experimental analysis first we describe the model configuration in 5 1 before we continue idealized experiments in sect 5 2 and a global ocean simulation in sect 5 3 the purpose of the idealized experiments is to illustrate the mathematical physical properties of sect 4 3 in dedicated experiments these experiments are constructed to focus on a specific property in a qualitative manner idealized experiments that allow a quantitative evaluation for example through calculation of errors or convergence rates with respect to reference solutions are not available in the literature in the global ocean simulation in sect 5 3 we focus on the impact of the new discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection on the large scale circulation 5 1 numerical implementation time discretization and tapering time discretization the discretization of isoneutraldiffusion and eddy advection described here is part of the ocean general circulation model icon o icon o uses a semi implicit adams bashford time stepping described in korn 2017 see chpt 5 6 the tracer diffusion in icon o uses a horizontally explicit and vertically implicit time stepping since the term of the isoneutral diffusion tensor that involves the square of the slopes l d 2 cf 60 potentially becomes large we follow the conventional approach see e g griffies et al 1998 and discretized this term implicitly since all other terms are discretized explicitly this formally destroys the essential mathematical physical properties described in sect 2 3 tapering when the isoneutral slopes become too steep e g in the mixed layer we leave the range if validity of the small slope approximation unrealistic fluxes are avoided by means of tapering here we use the tapering function of danabasoglu and mcwilliams 1995 defined by 84 t t l d 0 5 1 tanh s m a x l d s d if l d l d m a x 0 else where s max denotes the parameter that defines maximally allowed slope and sd 0 the width of the transition zone in which the tangens hyperbolicus switches between its extremal values 1 and 1 the tapering is applied to the different flux components of the tensor 60 in the following way 85 f i s o g m h c p g t k i p g grad h c p g t t k i κ l d q g d z c f i s o g m v c q g t t k i κ l d p

fundamental properties of our discretization as described in theorem 1 the computational domain of the experiments is the basin shown in fig 2 in the experiments in this section we show vertical slices of different quantities in north south direction as indicated in fig 2 5 2 1 isoneutral and laplacian diffusion the purpose of this experiment is to illustrate that the discretized isoneutral diffusion preserves the stratification better than laplacian diffusion eddy advection is not used in this experiment for this purpose we run the ocean model icon o with prescribed zero velocity vanishing external forcing so that we essentially integrate a diffusion equation with a diffusion operator that is either given by the isoneutral or by the laplace operator then we compare the effects of the two operators on the oceanic tracers and the resulting density structure the domain is the basin shown in fig 2 with a horizontal resolution of 17km and 40 vertical layers with a uniform vertical grid spacing of 10m the time step is 7200s the initial condition is a sloping density front defined via initial conditions for salinity s and potential temperature θ by 86 s x y z 34 0 psu 1 2 psu f x z and θ x y z 20 0 c 10 0 cf x z where f x z e z h x 2 a with h x d 2 1 4 tanh x b x 0 l z 0 d where l denotes the distance from the southern to the northern boundary and d 4000 m the depth α β r fig 3 shows vertical slices of initial potential temperature and salinity and the corresponding density for parameters a 40 0 b 1 5 we obtain a high salinity band embedded into a uniform background and a cold temperature band within a warmer background the parameter a b r determine the steepness of the respective slope and the broadness of the band on this initial state acts the laplace and the isoneutral diffusion operator the parameters are chosen such that horizontal vertical mixing coefficients of the laplace operator equal isoneutral dianeutral diffusivity k i k h 300 m s 2 k d k v 10 5 m s 2 figs 5and 4 show vertical slices of temperature and salinity after two years of integration with either the laplace operator or the isoneutral operator applied shown is the respective field top row and the corresponding difference to the initial condition bottom row the isoneutral fluxes are of the order o 10 9 for potential temperature and o 10 10 for salinity the corresponding laplacian fluxes are one order of magnitude bigger the laplacian simulation shows already a considerable blurring of temperature and salinity compared to the initial conditions this blurring of contours is most notably in the region of the steepest gradient in the centre of the basin a continuation of the simulation for long enough time will result in an uniform mixing in contrast the isoneutral diffusion has preserved the overall structure of temperature and salinity prominent features are the different magnitudes and sign of the tracer changes the salinity difference in the bottom row of fig 5 shows for the laplace operator in the central band a decrease of salinity while the isoneutral operator provides an increase the same applies to temperature the impact of the laplacian and isoneutral tracer dynamics on the density in fig 6 shoes a smearing of the density for the case of laplacian diffusion while the isoneutral diffusion preserves the density structure much better the change in density of isoneutral and laplacian mixing is quantified by the histograms in fig 7 the density range from 1024 to 1028 kg m 3 is classified into ten density categories fig 7 shows what happened to the initial density classes top row after two years with laplacian mixing left and with isoneutral diffusion right the histogram for the laplacian mixing shows a reduction of counts for the high and low density classes 1024 1025 5 k g m 3 and 1027 1028 k g m 3 and an increase in the middle density classes 1025 5 1027 k g m 3 this illustrates the mixing of density classes by the laplace operator for the isoneutral diffusion we observe that the density classes are much more similar to the original density distribution the most pronounced difference is an increase in the highest density class 1027 5 kg m 3 for isoneutral diffusion this indicates an overshoot the occurrence of over undershoots shows that the scheme does not satisfy a discrete maximum principle this can be attributed to the discrete violation of the variance reduction property as discussed in sect 4 3 1 or to a fundamental incompatibility between consistence and monotonicity applies see rem 1 in fig 8 we provide some information about the slopes and show the modulus α p g grad h t β p g grad h s of the numerator and the denominator of the slope 52 α q g d z t β q g d z s both plots show how these discrete derivatives align with the prominent flow features of our sloping front test case we study now the numerical representation of the projection property 56 and the balance 62 of isoneutral diffusion in this particular experiment the first property f i s o v c l d f i s o h c with f i s o h c f i s o v c defined in 55 relates the horizontal isoneutral flux to the vertical one through a projection in direction of the slopes we compute the difference e f i s o v c l d f i s o h c for this experiment and find that e o 10 18 without any tendency to increase results not shown for the balance property 62 we calculate the deviation of the horizontal and the vertical balance relationships from their ideal value zero 87 δ h t m a x k c k α t f i s o h θ k t β t f i s o h s k t r 3 δ v t m a x k c k α t f i s o v θ k t β t f i s o v s k t during the simulation the magnitude of the isoneutral fluxes is o 10 8 unit is c m s thermal expansion and haline contraction coefficients are of the order o 10 4 α 1 c β 1 p s u and we subtract in 87 two terms of o 10 12 in fig 9 we show the evolution of δh t δv t over time the time series have a magnitude of o 10 17 and o 10 20 with random fluctuations and a trend towards even smaller values the experiment of this section shows that the discretized isoneutral diffusion acts as expected and directs the mixing in direction specified by the slope vector and thereby preserves the stratification much better than the laplacian mixing 5 2 2 including eddy advection we repeat experiment 5 2 1 now with active eddy advection we use the tensor 60 and initial conditions 86 see top row of fig 10 the additional eddy parameter κ is identical to the isoneutral parameter k i κ 500 m s the maximally allowed slope is s max 5 10 4 time step is 900s and integration time 5 years in fig 10 we see initial and final state of potential temperature and density the overall structure is the same but the slope of the cold temperature band and the slope of the high density band have been reduced by the eddy advection the salinity not shown has also a less inclined profile and this in combination with the temperature change induces the density change the visible decrease of the inclination of the potential temperature and salinity band follows the logic of the parametrization to extract potential energy by flattening the slopes this is also confirmed by the plots in fig 11 which show the integrated effect of both parametrizations on temperature and density on the left hand side of the potential temperature profile we observe a warming effect in the lower half and a cooling effect on the upper half of the temperature band the density change on the right hand side show the reversed dynamics the reduction of the slopes is quantified in fig 12 the plots shows the modulus of numerator and denominator at initial time and after 5 years we see a distinct reduction of the modulus of the numerator by nearly the half in the magnitude of the denominator one notices only a small change indicating that the overall stratification is essentially preserved in order to quantify the degree to which the global skewness property 64 is satisfied we calculate for the tracers the diagnostic on the left hand side of 64 given by 88 skew g l o b a l f g m h c grad c h e f g m v c d z c h c k e e k f g m h c e k grad c e k e e k k c k f g

order o 10 20 units are c 2 s where c denotes the unit of c θ s for the global skewness 88 shows fig 13 the behavior of the volume weighted global integral over time the apparent spikes occurs for temperature and salinity at the same time we attribute this to the a relatively sudden change in the slopes caused by variations in the vertical derivatives of the slopes this does not alter the general accuracy to which the skewness is satisfied 5 3 global ocean experiment in this section we study our discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection in their natural environment of a global ocean circulation experiment the purpose of this experiment is to provide some phenomenological evidence that our discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection on unstructured grids impacts on long time scales the circulation as one expects it from the experience with structured grid ocean models with the classical discretization griffies et al 1998 griffies 1998 the goal of the section is not to provide a complete oceanographic discussion of this experiment the baseline comparison will again be the relative merit of the two parametrizations compared to laplacian tracer diffusion we stay in the constant parameter regime with all if its deficiencies and focus on the impact of the discretization on the large scale circulation we integrate icon o with surface fluxes from röske 2001 this surface forcing contains daily fluxes that are periodic with a period of one year the fluxes resemble in a statistical sense the atmospheric fluxes to which the ocean is exposed initial conditions of temperature and salinity are interpolated from the polar science center hydrographic climatology phc3 steele et al 2001 the resolution of the horizontal grid is 160km in the vertical we use 20 levels of varying thickness from 20m at the surface to 700m at the ocean bottom the model was integrated for 1000 years with a time step of 3600s the horizontal viscosity was parametrized with a laplacian operator and a constant value of ν 3 0 10 4 m s 2 vertical mixing uses a modified pacanowski and philander scheme following marsland et al 2003 vertical diffusivities and viscosities are calculated as follows 89 a v a 0 v 1 c r i r i 2 a b v and a c a 0 c 1 c r i r i 3 a b c with r i max d z ρ d z p g v 2 0 a small constant background viscosity a b v a b c represents mixing by internal wave breaking with values a b v 5 10 5 m s 2 a b c 10 5 m s 2 where c denotes temperature or salinity convection is parametrized as implicit vertical diffusion where in case of a diagnosed instability the diffusion coefficient is increased up to 2 10 3 m s 2 the values of isoneutral diffusion ki and eddy diffusivity κ are constant and equal to each other k i κ 1000 m s 2 the additional contribution to wind mixing is incorporated as described in marsland et al 2003 with a parameter of λ 0 03 the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc is shown in fig 14 with active isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection on the left plot and with laplacian mixing on the right plot we see a stronger overturning when the neutral parametrizations are activated with a maximum overturning of 16 sv at a depth of 800m compared to an overturning circulation of maximally 12 sv for the laplacian case and a circulation cell that extends also in deeper layers than the laplacian cell the antarctic bottom water has in both configurations the same strength of 3sv but shows a larger extend and reaching to greater depth for the isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection this indicates an improved poleward volume transport and in general a more vigorous circulation the effect of the neutral physics parametrization on the simulated hydrography is described in figs 15 and 16 here we average potential temperature and salinity over all longitudes and subtracted this average from the initial state of both tracers since this initial state is a climatology we refer to this difference as bias of potential temperature and salinity respectively for salinity we see in fig 3 1 a clear bias reduction over the upper 2000m the water is generally becoming less saline in greater depths than with laplacian mixing also for the potential temperature bias shown in fig 16 we observe a bias reduction in the upper 2000m and overall a sharper thermocline when the two parametrizations is activated compared against the laplacian diffusion with increasing depth the ocean is getting colder than with laplacian mixing finally we remark that the model can also be integrated with isoneutral diffusion only and without eddy advection results not shown without affecting the models stability we attribute this to the structure preserving properties of our discretization 6 discussion and outlook a new discretization method for the isoneutral diffusion by redi and the eddy advection by gent mcwilliams was formulated the theoretical analysis and the numerical experiments confirm the basic functionality of the discrete scheme from here on several research options emerge one is of course to progress towards the state of the art ocean parametrizations and develop a flow dependent parameter choice see e g greatbatch 2008 and eden et al 2009 a second research topic is the adaption of ocean parametrizations to high resolution experiments the increase of computational power of high performance computers enables ocean models to resolve more and more parts of the eddy spectrum and unstructured grid models such as icon o have been designed for this purpose flow dependent parameter choice might be necessary as well as a re interpretation one or both parametrizations as a kind of regularization or filtering without the direct physical interpretation they had originally a question related to the reconstructions p g and q g is to understand their impact on the parametrized flux in view of a desired reduction of numerical induced diapycnal fluxes an important theme is the search for horizontal and vertical reconstructions that reduce this diapycnal component and the question is whether high order reconstructions serve this purpose finally our discrete gent mcwilliams redi operator is capable of working on different grid cell geometries such as triangles rectangles or hexagons since this property is shared by the dynamical core of the icon ocean model korn 2017 we are in the position to study the impact of cell geometry on the ocean parametrizations using the same code for different grids acknowledgements the author thanks dr stephen

meteorology bundesstr 55 hamburg 20146 germany a structure preserving discretization of the isoneutral diffusion of redi and of the eddy induced skew diffusion scheme of gent and mcwilliams on unstructured grids is described the discretization is based on a variational principle and its essential element is a construction of a discrete hilbert space by means of admissible vector reconstructions these reconstructions are applied to discretize the isoneutral slopes as the key component of the parametrizations through the discrete scalar product of the hilbert space for the tracers we are able to represent isoneutral mixing tensor and eddy advection in weak form and to prove that the resulting discrete algorithm preserves essential physical properties of the continuous operator the discretization follows in principle the established variational and skew flux approach but implements these concepts via a natural extension of the discretization of the dynamical core of the unstructured grid ocean model icon o the theoretical analysis is supplemented by numerical experiments that illustrate that the discretization indeed implements the functionality of isoneutral diffusion and skew diffusion as complementary parameterizations of unresolved mesoscale eddy effects keywords ocean parametrization isoneutral diffusion eddy advection skew diffusion structure preserving discretization 1 introduction the mesoscale eddy advection of gent and mcwilliams 1990 gent et al 1995 and the isoneutral diffusion due to redi 1982 form cornerstones of modern global ocean general circulation models virtually every global ocean general circulation model based on vertical z coordinates relies on these subgrid scale closures isoneutral diffusion is motivated by the observational evidence that mixing in the ocean takes place predominantly within isoneutral surface and that the mixing across isoneutral surfaces is by orders of magnitude smaller a physical argument supporting this statment can be found in mcdougall et al 2014 this oriented mixing process has to be parametrized by ocean models using a z coordinate the parametrized eddy advection intends to capture the behavior of mesoscale eddies to advect tracers by an eddy induced transport velocity that complements the large scale transport velocity and to reduce potential energy by flattening isoneutral surfaces gent et al 1995 the two ocean parametrizations remove essential model biases and deficiencies of z coordinate models such as the veronis effect see the overview in gent 2011 in this work we use the names isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection as identifiers to discriminate between two different operators one of diffusive type and one of advective nature isoneutral mixing and eddy advection both have been formulated for the continuous ocean equations their discretization poses a challenging numerical problem for ocean models that rely on a staggered distribution of variables on the grid a solution to the discretization problem was provided in two landmark papers by griffies et al 1998 griffies 1998 in these papers a functional variational formalism for ocean models on structured grids was developed that implements a physically consistent discretization of both parametrizations recently a variant and a generalization to biharmonic isoneutral diffusion was suggested in lemarie et al 2012 the purpose of this paper is to enrich the existing spatial discretizations of eddy advection and isoneutral diffusion and to introduce within the general systematic of a functional variational formalism an alternative discretization of eddy advection and isoneutral diffusion on unstructured grids the discretization presented here has evolved naturally from the discretization methodology for the ocean primitive equations on the triangular arakawa c grid that was developed for the ocean general circulation model icon o model korn 2017 icon o formulates the discrete ocean equations in weak form and relies on admissible reconstructions to create a discrete hilbert space structure it is the discrete hilbert space property that we exploit here for the spatial discretization of eddy parametrization and isoneutral diffusion having a discrete hilbert space allows to formulate the tracer equations in a weak variational form see e g hughes 1997 and this form of the equations establishes a natural link to the functional variational formalism of griffies et al 1998 griffies 1998 2004 ocean general circulation models that are based on finite element methodology such as fesom 1 wang et al 2014 do also directly explore the weak variational form to implement the two parametrizations for such models the discretization problem is facilitated through the use of continuous finite element galerkin basis functions that create the discrete hilbert space structure in its recent finite volume version fesom 2 danilov et al 2017 variable staggering and numerical method have been changed now without galerkin basis functions eddy advection and isoneutral diffusion are discretized via the functional formalism of griffies et al 1998 griffies 1998 with a form of triad interpolation that is adapted to the unstructured fesom 2 grid see appendix d in danilov et al 2017 for general background on unstructured grid ocean modelling with a focus on the discretization of the dynamical core we refer to danilov 2013 2012 ringler et al 2013 the core idea of the variational functional formalism of griffies et al 1998 griffies 2004 for the discretization of the isoneutral mixing tensor is to associate to the laplacian mixing operator a unique functional whose derivative equals the laplacian 1 1 the mathematical relation between self adjoint and positive semi definite operators and functionals is known as the dirichlet principle see e g evans 1998 the ingenious contribution of griffies et al 1998 is to discretize the functional instead of the laplace operator and then take the functional derivative of the discrete functional to derive a consistent discretization of the isoneutral mixing operator this discretization diminishes variance and avoids artificial buoyancy fluxes and thereby fixes an instability problem of previous discretizations the discretization of the above mentioned functional takes place by means of the so called triad interpolation see griffies et al 1998 sect 5 b the eddy advection of gent mcwilliams is then included by interpreting this advective closure as a skew flux this results in a coherent and computationally efficient discretization of both ocean parametrizations we pursue here an inherent unstructured grid approach for the discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection our strategy is not to translate genuine structured grids concepts to unstructured grids although this is possible in our approach we remain in the variational functional framework that associates an operator and a functional and we emphasize the equivalent viewpoint that this functional can by virtue of the riesz representation theorem see e g reed and simon 1980 be identified with a scalar product and a norm the so called energy norm scalar products give rise to geometric notion and the language of the isoneutral and eddy parametrization is inherently geometric the scalar product notion has the advantage that it is also intimately linked to the concept of weak or variational solutions this work follows the geometric and scalar product based perspective we show how a scalar product on a staggered unstructured grid can be realized by means of the reconstructions that are necessitated by the differing location of horizontal and vertical tracer gradients the reconstruction operators considered here belong to the class of admissible reconstructions introduced in korn 2017 that are used in the discretization of the dynamcial core of icon o these reconstructions implement the scalar product and constitute the essential building block for the discretization of the mixing tensor another essential requirement is the duality of discrete divergence and gradient operators korn 2017 the resulting discrete scheme for both parametrizations can also be formulated on arbitrarily shaped polygons such as hexagonal or rectangular grid cells we prove by theoretical analysis that the so obtained discretization preserves essential mathematical and physical structures of the continuous parametrizations such as balance of buoyancy fluxes and tracer variance reduction for the isoneutral diffusion and skewness of the eddy fluxes in this sense is our discretizatio structure preserving these theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments the numerical evidence is provided by dedicated idealized experiments that allow to study a specific property in isolation and by a global ocean simulation that shows our new discretization within a general circulation model we emphasize that we do not address some important aspects of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection such as the physical realism of these parametrization see e g von storch et al 2016 or the problem of parameter choice see e g eden and greatbatch 2008 these relevant problems are not addressed here instead we focus on the problem of spatial discretization and of how to transfer essential mathematical physical properties of the mixing tensor from a continuous to a discrete model set up structure of the paper section 2 reviews mesoscale eddy parametrization and isoneutral diffusion in the continuous setting and highlights the essential mathematical and physical properties these properties are used in section 4 as a constrain for our structure preserving discretization of isoneutral mixing tensor and eddy advection we prove that essential mathematical and physical properties are retained by the discretization in sect 5 we provide experimental evidence that confirm the validity of or approach where sect 5 2 is dedicated to idealized experiments and sect 5 3 gives an impression of the behavior of the parametrizations in a global ocean simulation the work presented here complements the description of the dynamical core korn 2017 of the ocean component icon o within the icon modelling system icon is a joint project of the max planck institute for meteorology and the german weather service 2 isoneutral diffusion and mesoscale eddy advection in the continuous setting in the skew flux formalism denote by c either potential temperature or salinity c θ s the advection diffusion for the tracer evolution is given by 1 c t d i v 3 c v d c with d c d i v f s g s c where d denotes a general dissipative operator and where the subgrid scale flux f s g s c consists of two parts the isoneutral diffusive flux and the mesoscale eddy advection of gent mcwilliams 2 f s g s c f i s o c f g m c k i s o k g m c the tracer boundary conditions on the surface boundary ωs bottom boundary ωb and lateral boundaries ωl are 3 k i s o c z q t o p c at top boundary ω s 4 c z q b o t t o m c at bottom boundary ω b 5 h c 0 at lateral boundary ω l where q t o p c q b o t t o m c are the surface and bottom boundary fluxes of tracer c in this work we will always use a vanishing bottom boundary flux we use in our experiments in sect 5 a zero surface flux in idealized experiments and a nonvanishing surface flux of potential temperature and salinity for the global ocean simulation the two tracers potential temperature θ and salinity s determine together with the pressure p through the equation of state the ocean density 6 ρ ρ θ s p in this work we use as thermodynamic description potential temperature salinity and pressure replacing potential temperature θ by the more accurate conservative temperature ioc 2010 olbers et al 2012 would potentially improve our results but would not require changes to the spatial discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection that is presented here 2 1 isoneutral diffusion tensor the purpose of the isoneutral diffusion is to mimic the behavior of the real ocean by orientating the diffusing of ocean tracers preferably along locally neutral directions and to a much smaller extend perpendicular to the neutral direction the neutral direction is the local direction of neutral buoyancy the direction perpendicular to the neutral direction is the dianeutral direction mathematically this can be expressed either as a projection along the isoneutral dianeutral directions or equivalently as a coordinate rotation of the diffusive tracer flux parallel to the neutral direction see griffies 2004 olbers et al 2012 this leads to the isoneutral diffusion tensor as introduced in redi 1982 the isoneutral slopes l l h 0 lx ly 0 in 9 form a central concept of isoneutral diffusion as well as of the eddy advection see sect 2 2 the slopes are defined by 7 l h α h θ β h s α z θ β z s with coefficients of thermal expansion and haline contraction given by 8 α ρ θ s p c o n s t β ρ s θ p c o n s t where the derivatives in 8 are taken at constant s p for α and at constant θ p for β the observation that isoneutral surfaces are typically only mildly inclined justifies the small slope approximation the isoneutral diffusion tensor in this small slope approximation is given by 9 k i s o k i 1 0 l x 0 1 l y l x l y ϵ l 2 with ϵ k d k i 1 the fraction of dianeutral and isoneutral diffusivity the corresponding isoneutral flux with horizontal component f i s o h and vertical component f i s o v reads as follows 10 f i s o f i s o h f i s o v with 11 f i s o h c k i h c l h z c f i s o v c k i l h h c ϵ l 2 z c an important relation between the isoneutral tracer flux and the neutral component of the dianeutral tracer flux obtained by choosing kd 0 is given by 12 f i s o v c l h f i s o h c in numerical ocean simulations the dianeutral parameter kd is often set to zero because the dianeutral direction is in the small slop is approximation nearly identical with the vertical direction and the dianeutral mixing is then subsumed with vertical mixing processes 2 2 eddy advection the eddy advection approximates the eddy transport by a so called eddy induced velocity v such that v c v c where the overbar denotes a generic mean and the primed variables refer to fluctuations around this mean the eddy induced velocity is determined from a stream function ψ 13 v c u r l ψ and the stream function depends linearly on the slope 14 ψ z κ l here κ 0 is the coefficient of the eddy advection often also called thickness diffusivity in the advective formulation the eddy induced velocity v is added to the transport velocity in the skew flux formalism griffies 1998 the anti symmetric gent mcwilliams matrix is used given by 15 k g m κ 0 0 l x 0 0 l y l x l y 0 a simple direct calculation shows that the skew flux formalism and the advective formulation are equivalent if one uses the tracer transport in conservative form as it is usual then the skew flux form has the numerical advantage that one applies one derivative less to the slopes than the advective version of the eddy advection this reduces the computational noise of the eddy advection if we apply the gent mcwilliams eddy tensor 15 to the tracer gradient we obtain the flux 16 f g m h c κ l h z c f g m v c κ l h h c the combination of isoneutral diffusion 11 and eddy advection 16 gives the following formula which shows how both parametrizations can be combined by means of the respective iso dianeutral and eddy coefficients 17 f i s

griffies 1998 see also griffies 2004 contain the following set of properties of the two ocean parametrization under consideration these properties constitute a set of necessary conditions it induces the structure that we want to preserve by the discretization isoneutral diffusion is positive semi definite 18 ω c k i s o c d x 0 c isoneutral diffusion satisfied the following balance 19 α f i s o t

eq 1 for potential temperature and salinity c θ s with the tracer itself and integrate over the global domain ω assuming no flux homogeneous neumann boundary conditions then we obtain for the time evolution of tracer variance 1 2 d d t ω c 2 d x ω f s g s c c d x now we focus on the isoneutral diffusion operator f s g s c f i s o and derive with the specific form 10 11 of f i s o that cf sect 3b in griffies et al 1998 21 1 2 d d t ω c 2 d x ω f i s o c c d x ω k i s o c c d x 22 ω k i e 1 c 2 e 2 c 2 k d e 3 c 2 d x 23 ω k i c 2 ρ c 2 k d ρ c 2 d x where the isoneutral dianeutral coordinates e e 1 e 2 e 3 are defined as 24 e 1 z ρ z ρ e 2 e 1 e 3 e 3 ρ with the unit vector in dianeutral direction given by 25 ρ α θ β s α θ β s from the equation for the tracer variance 22 we observe that isoneutral diffusion does not increase the global tracer variance because the integrand in 22 is non negative eq 23 provides more information two of the three terms of the integrand are negative and contribute to a reduction of variance the second term under the integral 23 is positive and potentially adds variance but the amount of added variance is majorized by the first positive term if the tracer gradient is oriented in direction of dianeutral unit vector ρ the whole isoneutral term in 23 vanishes because the two terms in the first bracket cancel in this case the dianeutral term attains his maximal value since the isoneutral diffusion does not increase the tracer gradient the isoneutral flux is oriented down the gradient such that f i s o c 0 2 3 2 evolution of density for linear equation of state continuous case the balance property 19 is valid for a general equation of state if we assume the specific case of a linear equation of state then 19 implies that the isoneutral flux of density vanishes and that consequently the isoneutral diffusion does not change the density this can be seen as follows for a linear equation of state ρ α θ β s with α β 0 differentiation of ρ with respect to time yields 26 ρ t α θ t β s t d i v α f i s o θ β f i s o s d i v f i s o ρ 0 for a nonlinear equation of state the balance property 19 remains valid a consequence of nonlinear effects such as cabbeling thermobaricity and halobaricity that generate irreversible mixing the balance property 19 does no longer imply that the density remains unchanged see e g chpt 12 1 7 in griffies 2004 nevertheless does 19 couple the isoneutral fluxes of potential temperature and salinity and the preservation of this property on the discrete level plays an instrumental role in preventing grid noise a sensible translation of the properties above from the continuous equations to the discrete setting is fundamental for a stable numerical algorithm the properties 18 20 define the structure that we aim to preserve by our discretization of the isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection operators the topics of sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 will be discussed on the discrete level in sections 4 3 1 and 4 3 2 3 discrete tracer equations and admissible reconstructions in this section we provide the relevant context on the discrete tracer advection and diffusion equations this introduces also the methodological basis for the discretization of the parametrizations the complete discretization framework for the ocean primitive equations used in the ocean general citculation model icon o and is without the ocean parametrizations described in korn 2017 in icon o the advection diffusion equation of the oceanic tracer transport is discretized in weak variational form and reads as follows for all test functions ψ h c it holds that 27 d c d t ψ h c div p g t c p g v ψ h c d z c w ψ h c div f s g s h c ψ h c d z f s g s v c ψ h c this work focuses on the sub grid scale term f s g s c f s g s h c f s g s v c in order explain the discretization of this term we define in the following the grid g sect 3 1 the tracer space h c k and the scalar product bracket sect 3 2 the discrete differential operators div d z d z sect 3 3 and relevant horizontal and vertical reconstruction operators sect 3 4 the weak or variational form of the discrete equations interprets the equation in an averaged or weighted sense where the weights are given by the test functions weak forms of equations form the basis of finite volume and finite element schemes see e g hughes 1997 they are also standard in mathematical hydrodynamics see e g foias et al 2001 a physical oriented interpretation of weak forms in hydrodynamics can be found in sect 2 2 of whitham 1974 and the relation in mechanics between weak form and the principle of virtual power is discussed in dautray and lions 2000 see chpt 1 3 of the appendix in our method the test functions are given by piecewise constant functions this corresponds to a finite volume approach and the bracket h c to a discrete volume integral that by means of the divergence theorem is converted into a surface integral we emphasize the additional property of the bracket h c to constitute a scalar product more common to finite element methods because this provides a geometric interpretation that turns out to be useful in the discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection 3 1 the grid the icosahedral grid that we are using is derived from the icosahedron the platonic solid that is inscribed into a sphere such that north and south poles are connected both to vertices of a triangle the 20 equilateral triangles of the icosahedron are then subdivided through a bi section of the great circle arcs that create the triangle edges the new points located halfway between the existing triangle vertices are introduced as new vertices and are connected through great circle lines that constitute the new edges such that each triangular cell is subdivided into four sub triangles this process is repeated until we reach the desired grid resolution fig 1 shows an example of the final grid the naming conventions for grid quantities are listed in table 1 the horizontal grid is composed from grid cells identified with their circumcenter for the edge orientation we use the following conventions each edge ek has a normal vector n e k the two neighboring cells kk lk of the edge e k k k l k are connected by e k and ordered in a way such that the vector x k k x l k points in the direction of the edge normal associated with the outer normal we define the indicator function n e k k that takes the value 1 1 if n e k k is the outer inner normal of kk to each edge ek we assign a tangential vector t e k such that n e k t e k z e k where z e k is the unit vector pointing upward at the edge midpoint ek the corresponding indicator function is t e k k k for the vertical grid we use a z coordinate and the two dimensional grid quantities are simply extended by a third height based dimension we refer to three dimensional cells as prisms we denote the vertical coordinate levels by zk with k 1 n z the top layer carries the index k 1 and k increases downward the number of vertical levels depends on the topography and varies from cell to cell n z n z k definition 1 grid definition i the set of all cells at level k 1 n z is denoted by c k the set of edge midpoints at level k is denoted by e k ii the grid g is composed of a union of three dimensional prisms with triangular base element that tessellate the computational domain ω 28 g k 1 n z k c k k such that g ω the discrete lateral boundary g l of the domain ω is described as the union of the set of edges at level k g l k 1 n z g k with g k e k k k l k e k exactly one of the cells k k l k adjacent to edge e k is a land cell and one is a water cell 3 2 discrete spaces on the grid described in the previous section we model tracers such as potential temperature and salinity as discrete functions that are piecewise constant within a grid cell in this section we define the discrete functions spaces including scalar products norms and boundary conditions the space h c k of tracers at interior vertical level k 1 n z is defined as 29 h c k p c k r p k k p k k here c k denotes the set of all cell centers at level k kk a generic cell at level k the tracer space h c k is endowed with the volume weighted scalar product 30 p k 1 p k 2 h c k k c k k δ z k k p k k 1 p k k 2 for all p 1 p 2 h c k where kk denotes the area of cell kk at level k whose product with the level thickness δz k k result in the cell volume the horizontal diffusive fluxes of potential temperature and salinity are on the discrete level described by functions that are defined on cell edges and constant along an edge the function space is given by 31 h e k v e k r v e v e k satisfies tracer boundary conditions 46 and supplement it with a scalar product 32 v 1 v 2 h e k e e k e δ z k e e v e 1 v e 2 for all v 1 v 2 h e k lateral boundary conditions are specified on the primal grid and the discrete analogue of the no normal flux boundary condition at an edge of the boundary is v e n e 0 where ne denotes the normal vector at edge e diffusive vertical fluxes that at the top of a three dimensional computational prism in the ocean interior indexed by k 1 2 with k 1 n z 1 are described by the space 33 h c k 1 2 p c k 1 2 r p k k 1 2 p k k 1 2 analogously we define diffusive vertical fluxes that at the bottom of a three dimensional grid cell by 34 h c k 1 2 p c k 1 2 r p k k 1 2 p k k 1 2 by h c k 1 2 we denote the vertical fluxes at top and bottom of a cell at level k k 1 n z 1 for the surface level k 1 2 we set 35 h c 1 2 p c 1 2 r p k 1 2 p k 1 2 satisfies tracer boundary conditions 44 and for the bottom level 36 h c n z 1 2 p c n z 1 2 r p k n z 1 2 p k n z 1 2 satisfies tracer boundary conditions 45 the specification of the discrete boundary condition 44 46 is given once the discrete differential operators are introduces and can be found at the end of sect 3 3 all spaces 33 36 are supplemented by a scalar product the scalar products for these spaces are defined as a volume weighted scalar product analogously to 30 with the vertical thickness δz k k replaced by the distance between coordinate levels δ z k 1 2 for mathematical reasons that will appear in the discretization of the isoneutral slopes we define spaces for vectors that are constant on cells h c k p c k r 3 p k k p k k and supplement it with the scalar product 37 p 1 p 2 h c k k c k k δ z k k p k 1 p k 2 for all p 1 p 2 h c k here denotes the euclidian scalar product in r 3 the associated global spaces h c h c h c that cover not only individual levels but the whole domain are composed as union of the spaces h c k h c k and h c k 1 2 38 h c k 1 n z h c k and h c k 1 n z h c k 1 2 h c 1 2 h c n z 1 2 and for the vectors h c k 1 n z h c k the respective global scalar products are extend by a summation of 30 and 37 over all vertical levels 3 3 discrete differential operators after having defined the grid and the discrete functions on this grid we introduce the discrete differential operators for this definitions we use the function spaces h e k h c k of the previous section and the notation for the grid of sect 3 1 the discrete divergence operator div relies on gauss divergence theorem and is as follows for f h e k we define the discrete horizontal divergence div h e k h c k by 39 div f k k 1 k δ z k k e k f e k e n e k δ z e k note that we did not assume a particular cell shape such as a triangular cell the divergence definition applies to general polygonal cells the discrete horizontal gradient in normal edge direction grad h is a mapping grad h h c k h e k that is defined implicitly by 40 div f g h c k f grad g h e k for all f h e k g h c k this satisfies by definition a discrete integration by parts relation the boundary contribution in 40 vanishes due to the no flux boundary condition the definition of the discrete differential operators is completed by vertical differential operators for a cell based field f h c k we define this differential operator between vertical coordinate levels k 1 n z 1 by 41 d z h c k h c k 1 2 f d z f k k 1 2 f k k f k k 1 δ z k 1 2 and analogous operator between half levels 42 d z h c 1 2 h c k 1 2 f d z f k k f k k 1 2 f k k 1 2 δ z k the two operators are related via a vertical integration by parts rule for all f h c g h c it holds that 43 d z f k g k h c f k 1 2 d z g k 1 2 h c k c f k 1 2 g k 1 k c f k n z 1 2 g k n z this global relation can also be formulated locally i e for a single fluid column of one cell across all vertical levels discrete boundary conditions with the discrete differential operators we can define the discrete boundary conditions that correspond to 3 5 44 k i s o d z c k 1 2 q t o p c at top boundary 45 d z c k n z q b o t t o m c at bottom boundary 46 grad c e 0 at edges e g 3 4 admissible reconstructions on a staggered grid the discretization of isopycnal slopes requires horizontal and vertical reconstructions because horizontal and vertical gradients occurring in the slope definition reside at different grid locations we use here the concept of admissible reconstructions introduced in korn 2017 and korn 2018 we fill focus on the elements of the theory that are relevant for us and refer for a complete treatment to the two papers above we define generic linear operators between the discrete spaces introduced in sect 3 2 after describing necessary properties of these operators we give a particular example at the end of this section first we need an operator that reconstructs from normal edge components of a triangle the full cell centered vector 47 p g h e k h c k v p g v an example of such a horizontal reconstruction is the perot reconstruction perot 2000 with a modification to include variable topography kleptsova et al 2009 given by 48 p g h e k h c k v p g v k k 1 k z k k e k v e e d e k n e k δ z e k where d e k denotes the distance between midpoint of edge e k and cell circumcenter k and n e k n e k ne the outward pointing normal vector at edge e with respect to cell k to the generic reconstruction 47 we assign the transposed operator p g t with respect to the scalar products inf h e k and h c k defined by p g v φ h c k v p g t φ h e k for v h e k φ h c k the transposed operator maps in the opposite direction 49 p g t h c k h e k for the perot reconstruction 48 the transposed perot operator is given by the transposed operator that creates from two vectors at cell centers a normal vector component at the common edge is given by p g t h c k h e k f p g t f k l k 1 k l f k d e k f l d e l n k l if k l g 0 if k l g where gk denotes the set of boundary edges at level k the difference is ordered such that the direction from xk to xl coincides with the normal n k l at the edge k l note that the mappings p g p g t do not operate between spaces of the same dimension and are therefore not invertible the operators above will be used as building blocks to construct a symmetric positive definite operator for the weak form relevant to us are reconstructions that satisfy the following properties 2 2 the complete definition of admissible reconstruction in korn 2017 involves also a condition on the reconstruction used for the coriolis term and a filtering property for the spurious triangular c grid mode this is not relevant for our purpose here 1 p g reproduces constants in the following sense suppose v k r 3 is a constant vector in cell k its normal projections are v e v k n e with n e the normal vectors at edges e k of k then p g reconstructs the normal projections p g v k n e v k n e 2 p g t provides an unique and first order accurate flux at triangular edges we apply an analogous approach for the required reconstructions q g in the vertical direction the situation is here simplified by the fact that we use in the vertical a non uniform but one dimensional grid and that we need to deal with scalar and not vector quantities for the vertical reconstructions q g we impose that 50 q g h c k 1 2 h c k and its transpose q g t h c k h c k 1 2 satisfy the following properties 1 q g reproduce constants suppose w k k r is constant in cell kk with values w k k 1 2 h c k 1 2 at top and bottom of the cell then q g reconstructs the original w q g w k k w k k 2 q g t provides unique and first order accurate fluxes at the top bottom of a cell the vertical reconstruction operator from the top and bottom of a triangular prism to the middle is for k 1 n z defined as 51 q g h c k 1 2 h c k f q g f k k 1 2 z k z k k 1 2 f k k 1 2 z k k 1 2 f k k 1 2 the transposed operator is for k 1 n z 1 given by q g t h c k h c k 1 2 g q g t g k k 1 2 1 2 g k k g k k 1 k c 1 g k 1 δ z 1 2 2 k k c n z g k n z z k n z 1 2 2 k for the top of the first layer we set q g t g k 1 2 0 for all k k 4 structure preserving discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection 4 1 isoneutral slope discretization the eddy advection of gent mcwilliams as well as the isoneutral diffusion rely on the concept of the slope vector the slope describes the ratio between local horizontal change versus the vertical change of buoyancy see 7 by its nature the slope is a vector the difficulty of the slope discretization is due to the fact that the corresponding horizontal and vertical derivatives of the tracers are associated with different locations of the cell boundary horizontal derivatives with cell edges at the middle of a three dimensional cell prism and vertical derivatives with the cell centers and at top bottom of cell prism thus one has to decide first where the discrete slope vector is located and second which quantities have to be interpolated by which method these choices are consequential for the quantities that depend on the slope such as fluxes of isoneutral dianeutral mixing and the preservation of the mathematical structure described in sect 2 3 we choose to position the slopes at the center of a three dimensional computational prism and interpolate the derivatives to this location by means of admissible reconstructions described in the previous section our discretization is in form of a definition given by definition 2 discrete slope operator the discrete slope operator l d is defined as 52 l d h c k h c k h c k θ s l d l d θ s α p g grad h θ β p g grad h s α q g d z θ β q g d z s the discrete slope operator takes scalars θ and s at prism centers and produces a vector at prism centers the vector character of the slopes stems from the p g in the numerator the denominator contains a scalar calculation of thermal expansion α and haline contraction coefficients β the reference point for the thermodynamical coefficients are the cell centers i e α β h c k at those points the coefficients are multiplied with the reconstructed gradients of temperature and salinity the calculation of the thermodynamical coefficients can be done directly from the definitions α ρ θ and β ρ s in the numerical experiments in sect 5 we use for computational efficiency the less costly equations of state from mcdougall 1987 that allows an analytical differentiation see also sect 5c in griffies et al 1998 4 2 discrete form of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection the discrete iso dianeutral fluxes are required on the boundary of a three dimensional prism i e at edges at middle level of the prism and at center of a cell at top bottom of prism this is mandated by the subsequent application of the divergence operator to these fluxes based on the discrete slope calculation 52 we discretize now the building blocks of the continuous isoneutral fluxes in 11 by the following dictionary 53 continuous discrete l z c l d q g d z c l h c l d p g grad h c l 2 z c l d 2 q g d z c we see that the discrete differential expressions grad h c dz c are mapped to the position of the slope vector l d with these elements we can aggregate the following discrete counterparts of the continuous isoneutral flux calculation 11 54 f i s o h c p g t k i p g grad h c l d q g d z c f i s o v c q g t k i l d p g grad h c l d 2 q g d z c q g t k d q d z c the transposed operators in front of the expressions above transforms a vector into a normal component at edges it guarantee that the flux lives on cell edges or top bottom of a cell such that the discrete divergence can act on it the vector valued part of the isoneutral fluxes at cell centers are defined by 55 f i s o h c k i p g grad h c l d q g d z c and f i s o v c k i l d p g grad h c l d 2 q g d z c k d q g d z c and is related to the flux across an edge by f i s o h c p g t f i s o h c and f i s o v c q g t f i s o v c obviously we have the following relation between vector quantities at cell centers provided kd 0 56 f i s o v c l d f i s o h c this is the discrete equivalent to the continuous relation 12 the accuracy with which this relation is satisfied by the model code determines the degree of isoneutrality of the scheme for the eddy advection an application of the dictionary 53 above results in the following discrete fluxes 57 f g m h c p g t κ l d q g d z c f g m v c q g t κ l d p g grad h c we introduce 58 f g m h c κ l d q g d z c f g m v c κ l d p g grad h c such that 59 f g m h c p g t f g m h c and f g m v c q g t f g m v c the combination of 54 and 57 results in the final flux discretization 60 f i s o g m h c p g t k i p g grad h

parameters are functions k i k d κ h c k that are positive and bounded in this work we focus on the constant coefficient case 4 3 properties of structure preserving discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection in this section we prove that the discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection that was introduced in the previous section preserves the essential mathematical and physical structures of the continuous system that were described in sect 2 3 theorem 1 properties of discrete parametrization let p g q g be admissible horizontal and vertical reconstruction operators respectively as described in sect 3 4 denote by c θ s either potential temperature or salinity then the flux discretization of the isoneutral diffusion 54 and the mesoscale eddy advection of gent mcwilliams 57 together with the slope discretization 52 satisfy the following properties 1 the discrete isoneutral diffusion operator with fluxes given by 54 is positive semi definite 61 div f i s o h c c h c d z f i s o v c c h c 0 2 a discrete equivalent of the flux balance requirement 19 holds more precisely we have for θ s h c and for all cells k g 62 α f i s o θ k β f

in 57 58 proof ad 1 for the horizontal part of the isoneutral operator in 61 we find with 55 for all k 1 n z 65 div f i s o h c c h c k f i s o h c grad c h e k f i s o h c k i p g grad h c h c k k i

for c θ s and for all ϕ h e k we have according to 55 68 f i s o h c ϕ h e k f i s o h c p g ϕ h c k the terms in the balance relation 62 are for k g given by 69 α f i s o h θ k β f i s o h s k k i α p g grad h t β p g grad h s l d α q g d z t β q g d z s k and in order to prove 62 we have to show that the right hand side vanishes for the second term on the right hand side we observe from the definition of the discrete slope 52 that l d α q g d z θ β q g d z s α p g grad h θ β p g grad h s and since this cancels the first term on the right hand side of 69 it follows for all cells k c 70 α f i s o h θ k β f i s o h s k 0 the proof of the assertion for the horizontal part follows with 68 the statement for the vertical balance relation follows after an analogous calculation ad 3 the assertion i follows immediately from the definitions in 57 and 59 the assertion ii is equivalent to 71 grad c p g t κ l d q g d z c h e k q g t κ l d p g grad h c d z c h c k 1 2 0 the first term in

c k 1 2 and from 71 and 72 the assertion follows 4 3 1 tracer variance and downgradient diffusion discrete case the consideration below mirror the discussion in section 2 3 1 on variance and downgradient diffusion if we multiply the discrete tracer eq 27 for c θ s by c i e choose ψ c in 27 integrate over the whole domain and assume no flux homogeneous neumann boundary conditions then we obtain the semi discrete equations for tracer variance 73 1 2 d d t c 2 1 h c div f i s o h c f g m h c c h c d z f i s o v c f g m v c c h c after discrete integration by parts cf 40 43 we have 74 1

this equation has a continuous analogue in eq 21 the two terms on the right hand side of 74 can be reformulated as follows cf eq 67 in the proof of part i of theorem 1 75 1 2 d d t c 2 1 h c k i l d q g d z c p g grad h c h c 2 k d q g d z c h c 2 this establishes that the discrete isoneutral fluxes 54 do not increase the global tracer variance this continuous property of the isoneutral diffusion operator is retained in the discrete setting cf sect 2 3 1 the last equation reads with 37 as follows 76 1 2 d d t k 1 n z k c k k δ z k c k k 2 77 k i k 1 n z k c k k δ z k l d q g d z c p g grad h c k 2 k d k 1 n z k c k k δ z k q g d z c k 2 78 k i k 1 n z k c k k δ z k l d q g d z c k 2 p g grad h c k 2 2 q g d z c l d p g grad h c k 79 k d k 1 n z k c k k δ z k q g d z c k 2 the expression on the right hand side describe the amount of tracer variance that leaves grid cell k due to isoneutral and dianeutral fluxes these fluxes are constructed by horizontal and vertical tracer derivatives grad c d z c at edges of k and the horizontal and vertical reconstructions p g q g applied to these derivatives this reconstructs the gradient vector at the center of the prism where the slope resides which neighboring cells are involved in the reconstruction depends on the stencils of p g and q g the stencil of the perot reconstructions that we use in our experiments in sect 5 see sect 3 4 consists for p g of the three edges of triangle k for the vertical derivative and its vertical reconstruction q g the stencil consists of the two cells above and below cell k the variance reduction 77 relies on the reformulation of fluxes on the right hand side of 75 where the continuous time variable enabled us to complete the square this is usually not possible with a discrete time variable because for stability reasons do time stepping schemes handle the potentially big l d 2 term in 77 in an implicit manner consequently the two terms in 77 that make up the square are evaluated at different time steps formally this questions the property of variance reduction on the discrete levels this is a well known feature see the discussion in griffies et al 1998 to which extend this conceptually unpleasant issue is also practically relevant in degrading the model integrity depends on the actual numerical experiment 4 3 2 discrete evolution of density for linear equation of state discrete case to assess the impact of the discrete isoneutral diffusion scheme on the density if irreversible mixing cabbeling thermobaricity and halobaricity is absent we assume a linear equation of state differentiating the linear equation of state with respect to time and then use the evolution equations for potential temperature and salinity yields ρ t k α k θ t k β k s t k α k div p g t f i s o h θ k β k div p g t f i s o h s k α k d z q g t f i s o v θ k β k d z q g t f i s o v s k div p g t α f i s o h θ β f i s o h s k d z q g t α f i s o v θ β f i s o v s k 0 where f i s o h f i s o v was defined in 55 and where in the last step the balance relation 62 was used thus the spatial discretization of the isoneutral diffusion tensor leaves the density invariant if the equation of state is linear this corresponds to the continuous property as discussed in section 2 3 2 remark 1 violation of discrete maximum principle for discretization of isoneutral diffusion using a nine point stencil the analysis in beckers et al 1998 2000 mathieu and delersnijder 1998 shows that there is no linear and consistent discretization that is also monotone i e that guarantees that maxima do not increase and minima do not decrease between subsequent time steps this can for structured grids be expressed as a simple sign condition on the coefficients of the discrete isoneutral diffusion matrix see eqs 19 and 20 in beckers et al 1998 we are not able to derive such a transparent condition for our discrete isoneutral diffusion matrix because the unstructured nature of our grid prevents a separation of the grid in one vertical and one horizontal direction on which the derivation in beckers et al 1998 was based the results of our numerical experiments in section 5 indicate that our discretization shows also a violation of the maximum principle it is unknown ff the occurrence of over undershoots is due to a fundamental incompatibility between consistency and monotonicity or if it is a consequence of the time stepping that does not preserve the variance reduction see sect 4 3 1 the presence of over undershoots is known to be problematic for passive tracers see e g gnanadesikan 2011 in the preceding discussion of properties of the new scheme for isoneutral diffusion and eddy parametrization we have not made use of specific geometric properties of the triangular grid the key ingredients were the duality of div and grad and the corresponding use of the dual reconstruction pairs p g p g t and q g q g t an inspection of the arguments of the proof of theorem 1 yield immediately the following corollary that extends theorem 1 to general grids corollary 1 isoneutral difusion eddy advection on general grids let g denote a grid of polygonal cells not necessarily of triangular shape with a c type staggering let the divergence and gradient be defined by 39 and 40 and let p g q g be admissible horizontal and vertical reconstructions then the assertions of theorem 1 remain valid 4 4 relation to standard variational formalism the variational formalism griffies et al 1998 for discretizing the isoneutral diffusion applies the relation between certain operators and associated functionals this relation known as dirichlet principle see for example evans 1998 states that a symmetric and positive definite operator a such as the laplace operator can be expressed as the derivative δ of a positive definite functional i c such that a δ i the equation a c f has a solution c 0 if and only if c 0 minimizes the functional i c a c c d x 2 f c d x based on these observations and in an attempt to explain and overcome deficiencies of a previous implementation an approach was suggested in griffies et al 1998 that discretizes the functional i c instead of the operator a and then proceed with the differentiation of the discrete functional with respect to the tracer value to derive the dicsrete form of the isoneutral mixing operator for the isoneutral diffusion the dissipation functional is given by griffies et al 1998 eqs 18 and 25 80 i c g c c with g c 1 c 2 1 2 ω c 1 k i s o c 2 d x where k i s o is given by 9 the dissipation functional can be expressed as 81 i c 1 2 ω k i c x l x c z 2 c y l y c z 2 k d c z 2 d x two aspects are important here first g defines a scalar product on the space of tracers the scalar product defined by the right hand side of 80 is equivalent to the scalar product of the sobolev space h 1 ω see e g evans 1998 second the scalar product 80 is nothing else than the weak form of the isoneutral diffusion operator in discretizing the dissipation functional i in 81 it was proposed in griffies et al 1998 to subdivide each rectangular grid cell m into 8 subcells m n 1 8 m n to each of these subcells a unique thermal and haline coefficient αn βn is associated as well as a isoneutral diffusion coefficient k i n and horizontal and vertical gradients of tracer and density this allows to formulate the discrete isoneutral dissipation functional as follows 82 i d c 1 2 m c n k i n m n δ x c l x d δ z c 2 m n δ y c l y d δ z c 2 m n k d δ z c 2 m n where δx δy δz denote the standard discrete finite difference in the respective coordinate direction the slope l l x l y 0 is discretized as 83 l x d α δ x θ β δ x s α δ z θ β δ z s l y d α δ y θ β δ y s α δ z θ β δ z s the essential physical properties of isoneutral diffusion and eddy parametrizaton in sect 2follow now from the variational approach and a consistent calculation of the slopes at subcells using the appropriate thermodynamical coefficients this formalism griffies et al 1998 can be applied also on unstructured grids provided the discretization of the dissipation functional is modified accordingly in our discretization we take a more direct route and use the fact that we have at hand 1 the tracer equations in weak variational form such that the discrete scalar product described above is already available and 2 that we have discrete differential operators div grad that are transposed to each other and 3 vector reconstructions p g q and transposed operators that preserve the scalar product 5 numerical experiments in this section we supplement the theoretical investigations of sect 4 3 of our new scheme for isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection by an experimental analysis first we describe the model configuration in 5 1 before we continue idealized experiments in sect 5 2 and a global ocean simulation in sect 5 3 the purpose of the idealized experiments is to illustrate the mathematical physical properties of sect 4 3 in dedicated experiments these experiments are constructed to focus on a specific property in a qualitative manner idealized experiments that allow a quantitative evaluation for example through calculation of errors or convergence rates with respect to reference solutions are not available in the literature in the global ocean simulation in sect 5 3 we focus on the impact of the new discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection on the large scale circulation 5 1 numerical implementation time discretization and tapering time discretization the discretization of isoneutraldiffusion and eddy advection described here is part of the ocean general circulation model icon o icon o uses a semi implicit adams bashford time stepping described in korn 2017 see chpt 5 6 the tracer diffusion in icon o uses a horizontally explicit and vertically implicit time stepping since the term of the isoneutral diffusion tensor that involves the square of the slopes l d 2 cf 60 potentially becomes large we follow the conventional approach see e g griffies et al 1998 and discretized this term implicitly since all other terms are discretized explicitly this formally destroys the essential mathematical physical properties described in sect 2 3 tapering when the isoneutral slopes become too steep e g in the mixed layer we leave the range if validity of the small slope approximation unrealistic fluxes are avoided by means of tapering here we use the tapering function of danabasoglu and mcwilliams 1995 defined by 84 t t l d 0 5 1 tanh s m a x l d s d if l d l d m a x 0 else where s max denotes the parameter that defines maximally allowed slope and sd 0 the width of the transition zone in which the tangens hyperbolicus switches between its extremal values 1 and 1 the tapering is applied to the different flux components of the tensor 60 in the following way 85 f i s o g m h c p g t k i p g grad h c p g t t k i κ l d q g d z c f i s o g m v c q g t t k i κ l d p

fundamental properties of our discretization as described in theorem 1 the computational domain of the experiments is the basin shown in fig 2 in the experiments in this section we show vertical slices of different quantities in north south direction as indicated in fig 2 5 2 1 isoneutral and laplacian diffusion the purpose of this experiment is to illustrate that the discretized isoneutral diffusion preserves the stratification better than laplacian diffusion eddy advection is not used in this experiment for this purpose we run the ocean model icon o with prescribed zero velocity vanishing external forcing so that we essentially integrate a diffusion equation with a diffusion operator that is either given by the isoneutral or by the laplace operator then we compare the effects of the two operators on the oceanic tracers and the resulting density structure the domain is the basin shown in fig 2 with a horizontal resolution of 17km and 40 vertical layers with a uniform vertical grid spacing of 10m the time step is 7200s the initial condition is a sloping density front defined via initial conditions for salinity s and potential temperature θ by 86 s x y z 34 0 psu 1 2 psu f x z and θ x y z 20 0 c 10 0 cf x z where f x z e z h x 2 a with h x d 2 1 4 tanh x b x 0 l z 0 d where l denotes the distance from the southern to the northern boundary and d 4000 m the depth α β r fig 3 shows vertical slices of initial potential temperature and salinity and the corresponding density for parameters a 40 0 b 1 5 we obtain a high salinity band embedded into a uniform background and a cold temperature band within a warmer background the parameter a b r determine the steepness of the respective slope and the broadness of the band on this initial state acts the laplace and the isoneutral diffusion operator the parameters are chosen such that horizontal vertical mixing coefficients of the laplace operator equal isoneutral dianeutral diffusivity k i k h 300 m s 2 k d k v 10 5 m s 2 figs 5and 4 show vertical slices of temperature and salinity after two years of integration with either the laplace operator or the isoneutral operator applied shown is the respective field top row and the corresponding difference to the initial condition bottom row the isoneutral fluxes are of the order o 10 9 for potential temperature and o 10 10 for salinity the corresponding laplacian fluxes are one order of magnitude bigger the laplacian simulation shows already a considerable blurring of temperature and salinity compared to the initial conditions this blurring of contours is most notably in the region of the steepest gradient in the centre of the basin a continuation of the simulation for long enough time will result in an uniform mixing in contrast the isoneutral diffusion has preserved the overall structure of temperature and salinity prominent features are the different magnitudes and sign of the tracer changes the salinity difference in the bottom row of fig 5 shows for the laplace operator in the central band a decrease of salinity while the isoneutral operator provides an increase the same applies to temperature the impact of the laplacian and isoneutral tracer dynamics on the density in fig 6 shoes a smearing of the density for the case of laplacian diffusion while the isoneutral diffusion preserves the density structure much better the change in density of isoneutral and laplacian mixing is quantified by the histograms in fig 7 the density range from 1024 to 1028 kg m 3 is classified into ten density categories fig 7 shows what happened to the initial density classes top row after two years with laplacian mixing left and with isoneutral diffusion right the histogram for the laplacian mixing shows a reduction of counts for the high and low density classes 1024 1025 5 k g m 3 and 1027 1028 k g m 3 and an increase in the middle density classes 1025 5 1027 k g m 3 this illustrates the mixing of density classes by the laplace operator for the isoneutral diffusion we observe that the density classes are much more similar to the original density distribution the most pronounced difference is an increase in the highest density class 1027 5 kg m 3 for isoneutral diffusion this indicates an overshoot the occurrence of over undershoots shows that the scheme does not satisfy a discrete maximum principle this can be attributed to the discrete violation of the variance reduction property as discussed in sect 4 3 1 or to a fundamental incompatibility between consistence and monotonicity applies see rem 1 in fig 8 we provide some information about the slopes and show the modulus α p g grad h t β p g grad h s of the numerator and the denominator of the slope 52 α q g d z t β q g d z s both plots show how these discrete derivatives align with the prominent flow features of our sloping front test case we study now the numerical representation of the projection property 56 and the balance 62 of isoneutral diffusion in this particular experiment the first property f i s o v c l d f i s o h c with f i s o h c f i s o v c defined in 55 relates the horizontal isoneutral flux to the vertical one through a projection in direction of the slopes we compute the difference e f i s o v c l d f i s o h c for this experiment and find that e o 10 18 without any tendency to increase results not shown for the balance property 62 we calculate the deviation of the horizontal and the vertical balance relationships from their ideal value zero 87 δ h t m a x k c k α t f i s o h θ k t β t f i s o h s k t r 3 δ v

fluctuations and a trend towards even smaller values the experiment of this section shows that the discretized isoneutral diffusion acts as expected and directs the mixing in direction specified by the slope vector and thereby preserves the stratification much better than the laplacian mixing 5 2 2 including eddy advection we repeat experiment 5 2 1 now with active eddy advection we use the tensor 60 and initial conditions 86 see top row of fig 10 the additional eddy parameter κ is identical to the isoneutral parameter k i κ 500 m s the maximally allowed slope is s max 5 10 4 time step is 900s and integration time 5 years in fig 10 we see initial and final state of potential temperature and density the overall structure is the same but the slope of the cold temperature band and the slope of the high density band have been reduced by the eddy advection the salinity not shown has also a less inclined profile and this in combination with the temperature change induces the density change the visible decrease of the inclination of the potential temperature and salinity band follows the logic of the parametrization to extract potential energy by flattening the slopes this is also confirmed by the plots in fig 11 which show the integrated effect of both parametrizations on temperature and density on the left hand side of the potential temperature profile we observe a warming effect in the lower half and a cooling effect on the upper half of the temperature band the density change on the right hand side show the reversed dynamics the reduction of the slopes is quantified in fig 12 the plots shows the modulus of numerator and denominator at initial time and after 5 years we see a distinct reduction of the modulus of the numerator by nearly the half in the magnitude of the denominator one notices only a small change indicating that the overall stratification is essentially preserved in order to quantify the degree to which the global skewness property 64 is satisfied we calculate for the tracers the diagnostic on the left hand side of 64 given by 88 skew g l o b a l f g m h c grad c h e f g m v c d z c h c k e e k f g m h c e k grad c e k e e k k c k f g

order o 10 20 units are c 2 s where c denotes the unit of c θ s for the global skewness 88 shows fig 13 the behavior of the volume weighted global integral over time the apparent spikes occurs for temperature and salinity at the same time we attribute this to the a relatively sudden change in the slopes caused by variations in the vertical derivatives of the slopes this does not alter the general accuracy to which the skewness is satisfied 5 3 global ocean experiment in this section we study our discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection in their natural environment of a global ocean circulation experiment the purpose of this experiment is to provide some phenomenological evidence that our discretization of isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection on unstructured grids impacts on long time scales the circulation as one expects it from the experience with structured grid ocean models with the classical discretization griffies et al 1998 griffies 1998 the goal of the section is not to provide a complete oceanographic discussion of this experiment the baseline comparison will again be the relative merit of the two parametrizations compared to laplacian tracer diffusion we stay in the constant parameter regime with all if its deficiencies and focus on the impact of the discretization on the large scale circulation we integrate icon o with surface fluxes from röske 2001 this surface forcing contains daily fluxes that are periodic with a period of one year the fluxes resemble in a statistical sense the atmospheric fluxes to which the ocean is exposed initial conditions of temperature and salinity are interpolated from the polar science center hydrographic climatology phc3 steele et al 2001 the resolution of the horizontal grid is 160km in the vertical we use 20 levels of varying thickness from 20m at the surface to 700m at the ocean bottom the model was integrated for 1000 years with a time step of 3600s the horizontal viscosity was parametrized with a laplacian operator and a constant value of ν 3 0 10 4 m s 2 vertical mixing uses a modified pacanowski and philander scheme following marsland et al 2003 vertical diffusivities and viscosities are calculated as follows 89 a v a 0 v 1 c r i r i 2 a b v and a c a 0 c 1 c r i r i 3 a b c with r i max d z ρ d z p g v 2 0 a small constant background viscosity a b v a b c represents mixing by internal wave breaking with values a b v 5 10 5 m s 2 a b c 10 5 m s 2 where c denotes temperature or salinity convection is parametrized as implicit vertical diffusion where in case of a diagnosed instability the diffusion coefficient is increased up to 2 10 3 m s 2 the values of isoneutral diffusion ki and eddy diffusivity κ are constant and equal to each other k i κ 1000 m s 2 the additional contribution to wind mixing is incorporated as described in marsland et al 2003 with a parameter of λ 0 03 the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc is shown in fig 14 with active isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection on the left plot and with laplacian mixing on the right plot we see a stronger overturning when the neutral parametrizations are activated with a maximum overturning of 16 sv at a depth of 800m compared to an overturning circulation of maximally 12 sv for the laplacian case and a circulation cell that extends also in deeper layers than the laplacian cell the antarctic bottom water has in both configurations the same strength of 3sv but shows a larger extend and reaching to greater depth for the isoneutral diffusion and eddy advection this indicates an improved poleward volume transport and in general a more vigorous circulation the effect of the neutral physics parametrization on the simulated hydrography is described in figs 15 and 16 here we average potential temperature and salinity over all longitudes and subtracted this average from the initial state of both tracers since this initial state is a climatology we refer to this difference as bias of potential temperature and salinity respectively for salinity we see in fig 3 1 a clear bias reduction over the upper 2000m the water is generally becoming less saline in greater depths than with laplacian mixing also for the potential temperature bias shown in fig 16 we observe a bias reduction in the upper 2000m and overall a sharper thermocline when the two parametrizations is activated compared against the laplacian diffusion with increasing depth the ocean is getting colder than with laplacian mixing finally we remark that the model can also be integrated with isoneutral diffusion only and without eddy advection results not shown without affecting the models stability we attribute this to the structure preserving properties of our discretization 6 discussion and outlook a new discretization method for the isoneutral diffusion by redi and the eddy advection by gent mcwilliams was formulated the theoretical analysis and the numerical experiments confirm the basic functionality of the discrete scheme from here on several research options emerge one is of course to progress towards the state of the art ocean parametrizations and develop a flow dependent parameter choice see e g greatbatch 2008 and eden et al 2009 a second research topic is the adaption of ocean parametrizations to high resolution experiments the increase of computational power of high performance computers enables ocean models to resolve more and more parts of the eddy spectrum and unstructured grid models such as icon o have been designed for this purpose flow dependent parameter choice might be necessary as well as a re interpretation one or both parametrizations as a kind of regularization or filtering without the direct physical interpretation they had originally a question related to the reconstructions p g and q g is to understand their impact on the parametrized flux in view of a desired reduction of numerical induced diapycnal fluxes an important theme is the search for horizontal and vertical reconstructions that reduce this diapycnal component and the question is whether high order reconstructions serve this purpose finally our discrete gent mcwilliams redi operator is capable of working on different grid cell geometries such as triangles rectangles or hexagons since this property is shared by the dynamical core of the icon ocean model korn 2017 we are in the position to study the impact of cell geometry on the ocean parametrizations using the same code for different grids acknowledgements the author thanks dr stephen

24072,this paper presents a method to parameterize vertical turbulent mixing coefficients within the ocean surface boundary layer osbl for climate applications the new method is specifically constructed to satisfy two requirements the first aspect is to explicitly consider the mechanical energy budget of the turbulence that drives mixing this constraint ensures a realistic and robust simulation of the osbl which is critical for coupled climate simulations the second aspect is that the model should be formulated so that it is not sensitive to the numerical limitations common to climate simulations such as long time steps and coarse vertical grids this goal is achieved by combining an existing resolved shear driven mixing parameterization here jackson et al 2008 with a new method to avoid time step sensitivity the new method is motivated by the kraus turner niiler type bulk boundary layer parameterization but relaxes the requirement for vertical homogeneity the non dimensional coefficients m and n from the kraus turner niiler approach are parameterized for the new method based on results of simulations using a previously tested parameterization at high resolution the resulting parameterization is evaluated by comparing simulations with the new parameterization to simulations with the k ϵ parameterization over a wide range of combinations of surface wind stress surface buoyancy flux and latitudes the new method for vertical turbulent osbl mixing is therefore proposed as a computationally efficient implicitly energetically constrained option appropriate for ocean climate modeling applications keywords vertical mixing parameterization upper ocean turbulent boundary layer 1 introduction the ocean surface boundary layer osbl is the only part of the ocean directly influenced by the atmosphere it is also a region where turbulent energy and dissipation often exceeds the ocean interior values by several orders of magnitude this elevated turbulence leads to a fundamentally unique regime where distinct physical processes govern the dynamics compared to the interior e g moum and smyth 2001 soloviev and lukas 2013 the osbl is bounded at its surface by the air sea interface while the bottom boundary is typically constrained by strong density gradients the vigorous turbulence results in significant mixing within this layer combining properties modified by the atmosphere above and entrainment from the ocean interior below the physics that govern this regime couple processes spanning from the small scale of dissipation to eddies as large as the boundary layer for simulating large scale ocean climate current computational allocations dictate the use of hydrostatic momentum equations discretized with horizontal grid spacing between 25 100 km and variable vertical grid spacing between 1 100 m e g griffies et al 2016 the vertical grid spacing may be finest within the boundary layers to resolve important near surface processes and coarsest in the interior this grid does not resolve osbl turbulence requiring the effect of turbulence on ocean evolution to be simulated using boundary layer parameterization 1 1 boundary layer parameterizations the leading order mean osbl equation for arbitrary scalar ϕ assuming a horizontally homogenous distribution is 1 ϕ t z w ϕ ν ϕ 2 ϕ z 2 where νϕ is the molecular diffusivity w is the vertical velocity and w and ϕ are fluctuations from ensemble averages w and ϕ this equation describes the evolution of mean quantity ϕ due to vertical processes including the divergence of the turbulent flux covariance term and often negligible molecular mixing a challenge common to simulating any turbulent fluid at resolutions coarser than those required for dns direct numerical simulation where turbulent fluxes are entirely resolved is to skillfully parameterize the turbulent fluxes the turbulence closure problem for practical oceanographic applications this parameterization must emphasize computational efficiency there is a wide range of approaches that are employed to parameterize turbulent fluxes for ocean simulations see burchard et al 2008 here we focus on energetics based osbl parameterizations the downward turbulent flux of buoyant water by osbl turbulence converts mechanical energy into potential energy as it mixes with less buoyant water at the base of the osbl we focus on osbl parameterizations that constrain this integrated potential energy conversion due to turbulent mixing a simple method employed by several older generation basin and global scale ocean models is the kraus turner niiler well mixed boundary layer parameterization kraus and turner 1967 niiler and kraus 1977 the kraus turner niiler method assumes no vertical property gradients inside a well mixed osbl the relative simplicity of this approach facilitates implementation of exact implicit solvers for the potential energy change due to turbulent mixing in the water column simulations employing this scheme are therefore not significantly degraded by coarse vertical resolution and long time steps another approach follows the boussinesq hypothesis boussinesq 1877 for turbulence closure this hypothesis approximates the reynolds stress terms using an eddy viscosity eddy diffusivity for turbulent scalar fluxes 1 1 see schmitt 2007 for discussion on the historical connection between j boussinesq s hypothesis and o reynold s work the reynolds stress is parameterized as down gradient of the mean velocity profile as an analogue to molecular viscosity 2 u i w k m u i z where ui are the horizontal components of the velocity similarly the eddy diffusivity is used to parameterize turbulent scalar fluxes as 3 ϕ w k ϕ ϕ z the parameters needed to close the system of equations are then reduced to the turbulent mixing coefficients kϕ and km first order approaches determine these coefficients based on mean flow parameters such as in the k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 and pacanowski and philander 1981 however first order approaches do not typically consider the change of the potential energy in the water column due to turbulent mixing second order 2 2 here we adopt the colloquial terminology of order that is common in the literature though formally these parameterizations are referred to by their moment parameterizations formulate equations to predict the mixing coefficients using second moment turbulent quantities such as the turbulent kinetic energy tke these approaches explicitly consider energetic constraints of turbulent mixing via the mechanical tke conservation equation discussed further in section 2 2 the most complex approaches of this nature are based on a consistent mathematical framework to express the coupled differential equations for the turbulent fluxes these approaches are summarized by the systematic level of closure description proposed by mellor and yamada 1974 see also galperin et al 1988 canuto et al 2001 several types of second order turbulent closure have been applied to oceanic boundary layers most notably mellor yamada k kl see mellor and yamada 1982 kantha and clayson 1994 and canuto et al 2001 k ϵ e g rodi 1987 and burchard and baumert 1995 k ω e g wilcox 1988 and umlauf and burchard 2003 and the generic length scale gls e g umlauf and burchard 2003 and kantha 2004 for climate simulation there are computational challenges that discourage use of second order osbl parameterization second order approaches are most often employed for coastal ocean models where numerical stability restrictions with horizontal grid spacing less than 1 km dictate model time steps on the order of minutes for the dynamics which approximately corresponds to timescales of turbulence evolution global models with a grid spacing of 25 km or more permit dynamics time steps greater than 1000 s and thermodynamic mixing time steps exceeding one hour the large time steps limit the use of the second order approach in global models since the timescales of tke evolution are unresolved see reffray et al 2015 boundary layer parameterizations that require short time steps in ocean models make the resultant model impractical for studying climate timescale phenomenon several approximations and simplifications have been proposed to ease the computational burden associated with second order methods see gaspar et al 1990 d alessio et al 1998 however these models remain sensitive to the time step due to the coupled evolution of the turbulence and the mean fields see reffray et al 2015 one second order method we will discuss further in section 2 3 is specifically formulated to employ in climate models jackson et al 2008 hereafter jhl jhl has not previously been implemented for turbulent mixing in the osbl surface waves are known to significantly impact the dynamics of the osbl belcher et al 2012 d asaro et al 2014 recent studies have demonstrated the importance of wave effects to improve biases in ocean mixing in climate models fan and griffies 2014 li et al 2016 these studies both employed the first order kpp parameterization modified to include the effect of surface waves for brevity we reserve discussion of parameterization of the effect of waves within climate models for a separate study the limitations of neglecting wave effects are discussed further in section 6 1 1 2 outline we present here a framework to parameterize osbl turbulent mixing for climate models our approach is motivated to satisfy two criteria first it must maintain a realistic constraint on potential energy change due to turbulent mixing in the osbl second the computational requirement of the parameterization must be low relative to other components of the ocean model moreover it must accurately represent the effects of turbulence in models that operate with the time step that characterizes the dynamics of the ocean climate system about one hour we begin section 2 with a review of mechanical energy based osbl parameterizations we demonstrate that the well mixed boundary layer framework is skillful for limiting sensitivity of osbl parameterization to time step and vertical resolution in section 3 we investigate the energetic constraints imposed in the well mixed boundary layer formulation in section 4 we describe a new method to extend the well mixed boundary layer parameterization to simulations that do not require a homogenous osbl finally in section 5 the capabilities of this method are tested against a commonly used second order turbulent mixing parameterization run with fine vertical resolution and small time step the k ϵ parameterization with schumann and gerz 1995 stability functions the result of this study is the formulation of a simplified implicit energetics based method to parameterize the effects of turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer that can be implemented with minimal computational overhead and minimal resolution sensitivity for coupled ocean climate simulations 2 energetically constrained osbl parameterizations for climate models the energetics of osbl turbulence are described by the mechanical tke conservation equation see rodi 1987 4 k t z k m σ k k z u i w u i z w b ϵ where k is the tke σk is the turbulent schmidt number b is the buoyancy and ϵ is the turbulent dissipation rate the terms in this equation represent tke storage lhs tke flux convergence rhs 1st shear production rhs 2nd buoyancy production rhs 3rd and dissipation rhs 4th the term that contributes to potential energy conversion is the buoyancy production term we review three types of energetically constrained mixing parameterizations in this section that consider the effect of this buoyancy term on ocean energetics we start by reviewing the well mixed boundary layer approach section 2 1 this approach integrates the osbl and applies eq 4 to predict an entrainment velocity second we review approaches that solve eq 4 and use the tke to constrain the turbulent mixing section 2 2 finally we review another method based on eq 4 but that makes simplifications targeted for implementation in climate model configurations section 2 3 we restrict discussion in this section to schemes that are energetically constrained therefore first order parameterizations such as kpp large et al 1994 are not discussed in detail these parameterizations use energetically motivated richardson number arguments to predict the mixing coefficients however they do not explicitly consider the effect of the mixing coefficient on the potential energy conversion in the water column 2 1 well mixed boundary layers wmbls the well mixed boundary layer wmbl parameterization 3 3 historically these are often called mixed layer or bulk mixed layer parameterization we prefer well mixed boundary layer to be consistent with parameterizations that do not require a vertically homogenous osbl is described in detail in several previous studies see kraus and turner 1967 niiler and kraus 1977 garwood 1977 deardorff 1983 gaspar 1988 oberhuber 1993 wmbls assume that the osbl is vertically homogeneous which simplifies the ocean model by simulating only vertical integrals within the osbl the integral of eq 1 for ϕ over the osbl thickness hbl is 5 h b l 0 ϕ t d z h b l 0 z ϕ w d z where ensemble averages are assumed ϕ w and the molecular component is assumed small large reynolds number the quantity ϕ is assumed uniform in this layer so eq 5 is written e g gaspar 1988 6 ϕ t 1 h b l ϕ w 0 ϕ w b l where denotes a vertically averaged quantity the turbulent boundary conditions are the only turbulence quantities retained in 6 the prescribed surface flux arises from air sea and ice sea exchange of matter energy and momentum the bottom turbulent entrainment flux in wmbls are written in jump form following niiler and kraus 1977 7 ϕ w b l w e ϕ ϕ i w e δ ϕ where ϕi is the interior value of ϕ and we is the entrainment velocity the entrainment velocity is the only turbulent quantity requiring closure in wmbls this term is the time derivative of the osbl depth gaspar 1988 8a w e h b l t h b l t 0 8b w e 0 h b l t 0 in wmbls the tke 4 is assumed steady state and is integrated over the osbl following niiler and kraus 1977 9 0 h b l 0 z k m σ k k z d z h b l 0 u i w u i z d z h b l 0 w b d z h b l 0 ϵ d z the terms of eq 9 are parameterized to determine we following niiler and kraus 1977 gaspar 1988 the first rhs term tke flux convergence is parameterized as m 2 u 3 this proportionality assumes the surface tke flux is correlated to the friction velocity cubed u τ ρ 0 1 2 τ is the wind stress via a coefficient m 2 this surface tke flux could represent for example tke injection by breaking surface waves the second rhs term tke shear production is parameterized as m 3 u 3 the third rhs term buoyancy production is known for a uniform well mixed layer as 10 h b l 0 w b d z 1 2 h b l w e δ b 1 2 h b l b h b l where b hbl is the surface buoyancy flux considering interfacial and penetrative short wave fluxes both rhs terms in eq 10 can contribute to increased potential energy through turbulent mixing the first term increases potential energy when the osbl deepens we 0 the second rhs term accounts for potential energy change by turbulent mixing in the presence of stabilizing surface fluxes the final term in eq 9 is the dissipation one simple option to parameterize dissipation assumes that it is proportional to production via a convective proportionality coefficient 1 n and a mechanical proportionality coefficient md niiler and kraus 1977 gaspar 1988 11 h b l 0 ϵ d z m d u 3 h b l 2 1 n b h b l during stabilizing surface buoyancy flux n is unity and it becomes less than one during convection this study discusses the proper value in section 3 1 following the assumptions above the boundary layer tke balance is 12 1 2 h b l w e δ b m u 3 n h b l 2 b h b l where the sum of the mechanical m coefficients is defined as 13 m m 2 m 3 m d the first rhs term m u 3 in eq 12 represents the increase of water column potential energy by mechanically produced tke in the presence of a stabilizing surface flux this term must exceed the surface buoyancy flux term for we to be non zero the second rhs term in eq 12 contributes to we during destabilizing surface buoyancy fluxes when there is sufficient tke produced by the wind waves and convection to counter the tke destroyed by dissipation and mixing of surface stratification associated with a stabilizing surface flux then the boundary layer deepens when the tke production is no longer greater than dissipation the lhs of eq 12 is taken to be zero and the boundary layer depth retreats to the monin obhukov depth u 3 w b 0 the stabilizing rotational osbl depth limit of zilitinkevich and mironov 1996 indicates that the value of m should depend also on coriolis parameter f in this limit oberhuber 1993 indeed include additional vertical dissipation to m exponentially dependent on the ekman length exp z f u we investigate implications of rotation in wmbls in further detail in section 3 2 for discussion of traditional values of n and m see gaspar 1988 in prior generations of large scale ocean models the cheap computational cost of implementing eq 12 motivated use of wmbls e g oberhuber 1993 bleck 2002 thompson et al 2002 furthermore the total energy available for entrainment is prescribed from m and n and therefore is not sensitive to model time step and vertical resolution however there are well known limitations for climate models to assume that quantities are vertically uniform within the osbl for example the structure of the ekman spiral is important for restratification of the osbl along horizontal density gradients e g rodhe 1991 thomas and ferrari 2008 d asaro et al 2011 2 2 second order tke parameterizations in second order k parameterizations the mixing coefficients eqs 2 and 3 are predicted from dimensional reasoning as an analogue to the kinetic theory of gas 14a k m c μ k 1 2 l 14b k ϕ c μ k 1 2 l where cμ and c μ are stability functions the ratio of the two is the turbulent prandtl number pr and l is a turbulent length scale the tke eq 4 is solved numerically in second order parameterizations the dissipation term ϵ is dimensionally related to the length scale and the tke via kolmogorov 1942 15 ϵ c μ 0 3 k 3 2 l where c μ 0 is a model coefficient linking the turbulent length scale to the tke and the dissipation simplified one equation and two equation methods parameterize the stability functions from mean quantities the length scale is typically modeled using either a second prognostic equation such as in two equation models e g k ϵ rodi 1987 burchard and baumert 1995 k k l mellor and yamada 1982 galperin et al 1988 canuto et al 2001 k ω wilcox 1988 umlauf and burchard 2003 and gls umlauf and burchard 2003 kantha 2004 or an algebraic relationship such as in one equation models e g k l gaspar et al 1990 in the two equation k ϵ closure the ϵ dissipation equation is solved prognostically from see rodi 1987 16 ϵ t z k m σ ϵ ϵ z ϵ k c

burchard 2005 the relationship between these coefficients determines the steady state richardson number of the parameterization which is critical for determining the entrainment rate in any second order model burchard and baumert 1995 the alternative prognostic length scale approaches have relatively similar forms c f rodi 1987 umlauf and burchard 2003 kantha 2004 and give consistent results if the empirical coefficients are adjusted accordingly rodi 1987 burchard et al 1998 burchard and bolding 2001 warner et al 2005 one equation approaches simplify the implementation to estimate the length scale from algebraic relationships in many scenarios one equation methods provide reasonable estimates for the turbulent mixing reffray et al 2015 an empirical approach to determine stability functions is to approximate them as functions of quantities such as the gradient richardson number rig this approach assumes relationships between the prandtl number and the richardson number schumann and gerz 1995 peters and baumert 2007 ilıcak et al 2008 2 3 a two equation closure for climate models by jackson et al 2008 the two equation k parameterization of jackson et al 2008 was developed for parameterizing mixing due to internal shear layers in the ocean such as in the equatorial under current or in deep ocean density overflows here we apply this parameterization for osbl wind driven shear turbulence while the equations of jhl formally include both convective and shear sources of tke it is only previously calibrated for parameterization of shear turbulence we therefore limit discussion of this parameterization to shear driven turbulence the jhl approach simplifies the two equation framework to facilitate fully implicit numerics for climate models the tke conservation equation is found from eq 4 with steady state and assumed dissipation functions 17 0 z k m σ k k z k m s 2 k ϕ n 2 k c n n c m s where cn and cm are empirical model dissipation coefficients the second

2 k s f we do not distinguish between kϕ and km here implying a prandtl number of unity though more general approaches apply umlauf 2009 discusses the physical implications of jhl in reference to more traditional second order methods the assumptions involved in using eqs 17 and 20 facilitate implementation of coupled cost effective iterative implicit numerical solvers for both the turbulent properties and their impacts on the momentum and density structure see jhl this fully implicit approach facilitates parameterizing shear driven turbulent mixing in models with time steps characteristic of climate simulations e g within mom6 climate model configurations adcroft et al in prep 2 4 considerations for global climate model time steps and vertical resolution in this section three energetically based osbl turbulent mixing parameterizations were discussed there are two aspects of such parameterizations that we consider for implementation in a global ocean model first is the ability of the parameterization to accurately simulate boundary layer physics second is the ability of the parameterization to work in computationally restricted numerical implementations including coarse vertical resolution and long time steps to evaluate the ability of the three parameterizations to work well with coarse vertical resolution and long time steps we investigate results from simulations of one dimensional column models with various time steps and resolutions see appendix b for details on the one dimensional model implementations to test the sensitivity to vertical resolution we vary the model grid thickness using values of 1 5 10 and 20 m with a constant time step of 10 s to test the sensitivity to time step we vary the model time step from 1 s to 7200 s with a constant grid thickness of 1 m we will examine the performance of the osbl parameterizations in both wind shear driven and buoyancy driven turbulence conditions for this exercise we use the k ϵ parameterization with the schumann and gerz 1995 stability functions as our two equation k parameterization hereafter k ϵ sg the k ϵ sg parameterization chosen here has previously been validated by observational studies peters and baumert 2007 ilıcak et al 2008 we also include results from a wmbl parameterization with constant m 1 2 and n 0 2 for the shear driven case we also include simulations using the jhl parameterization to evaluate the effect of resolution on the energetic constraint we investigate the change in integrated potential energy we initialize the model with a constant temperature gradient 0 01 c m 1 and homogenous salinity in each case the integrated temperature is consistent between all runs but the vertical distribution of this temperature changes the potential energy the change in potential energy is due to both the application of a surface heat flux and the entrainment mixing the surface flux contribution is unrelated to the turbulence parameterization and both are sensitive to the vertical resolution in all cases results are presented after 48 hours of simulation 2 4 1 one dimensional simulation of convective osbl first we investigate a case where the turbulent mixing is driven by convection via cooling of 100 w m 2 we find that both the wmbl and the k ϵ sg turbulence models give little sensitivity to time step and vertical resolution after 2 simulation days fig 1 the vertical resolution sensitivity is related to the coarseness of the first model layer where the surface cooling is applied evenly over 1 5 10 or 20 m depending on the resolution note that the non monotonic behavior with thickness is variable in time indicating the complex relationship between potential energy change due to surface cooling and entrainment 2 4 2 one dimensional simulation of wind driven osbl next we simulate a case with a strong surface wind forcing of 1 n m 2 in this case rotation effects are important for the boundary layer so we include both a case with no rotation equatorial and a case with maximum rotation north pole we find that with no rotation the k ϵ sg model gives significant sensitivity to long time steps missing all mixing at 7200 s fig 2 the jhl approach does not show this dependency likely because jhl is implemented in the model fully implicitly over the coupled turbulence and mean flow evolution whereas the k ϵ sg implementation solves the tke and ϵ implicitly dependent on the previous time step mean parameters at high latitudes both the jhl model and the k ϵ sg model are sensitive to the time step and the grid spacing the effect of rotation is not directly considered within any equations of the two equation osbl parameterization the effect of rotation on the column model is therefore entirely due to its effect on the evolution of the mean horizontal current profile this feeds back to the turbulence through the mean shear profile which will affect both the shear production term and the dissipation equation the sensitivity to grid spacing is therefore likely due to limited ability to resolve the temporal and spatial ekman spiral characteristics at coarse vertical resolution and long time steps this is exacerbated by the steady state equations used in jhl the sensitivity to time step in jhl and k ϵ sg is not entirely by the same cause the k ϵ sg sensitivity is likely related to the same time step effect that was found at the equator the jhl scheme was not sensitive to time step at the equator so it is likely only affected by time step due to coupling of turbulence with explicit numerics for coriolis acceleration the jhl model is formulated for coupled implicit turbulence and diffusion numerics so the time step dependence at high latitudes shows that significant error may still occur due to a rotating mean flow at long time steps in all cases reduced resolution and longer time steps both contribute to under estimated mixing except at 1200 s in k ϵ sg where the model appears to exhibit unstable behavior the bulk boundary layer has no dependence on vertical resolution or time step since the total mixing is only constrained by fixed constant external parameters m and u 2 4 3 implications of numerical sensitivity this numerical sensitivity experiment does not evaluate the performance of any parameterization to simulate accurate boundary layer physics the wmbl parameterization section 2 1 is not a useful approach for modern climate models because it does not resolve boundary layer structure and relies on poorly constrained global m and n coefficients these weaknesses can result in significant biases in prediction of the osbl evolution the shear driven mixing predicted by second order models is degraded by long time steps and coarse vertical model resolution a problematic weakness for ocean climate modeling the remainder of this manuscript therefore presents a framework motivated to combine the ideas of the wmbl and the k parameterization for an osbl parameterization capable of consistent turbulent mixing at long time step and coarse resolution for climate simulations 3 parameterizations for m and n based on k ϵ the potential energy change by turbulent mixing hereafter m is computed from the integral of the stabilizing buoyancy flux 21 m h b l h b l 0 k ϕ max n 2 0 d z the notation represents vertically integrated quantities the subscript denotes that the integral is over the osbl this quantity has mks units of m3 s 3 w m 2 m3 kg 1 which is the rate of potential energy density production per unit horizontal area in second order closures sections 2 2 this term is a component of the integral balance with the shear production convective production dissipation and tke storage by using 21 we express eq 9 of wmbls as 22 m h b l h b l 0 z k m σ k k z d z h b l 0 k m s 2 d z h b l 0 k ϕ min n 2 0 d z h b l 0 ϵ d z if we follow the wmbl assumption that dissipation is proportional to production via coefficients m and n section 2 1 the rhs of eq 22 becomes 23 m h b l m u 3 n h b l 0 k ϕ min n 2 0 d z the difference in eq 23 compared to eq 12 is that mixing occurs throughout the osbl instead of at the base of a homogeneous layer in this section we investigate precise values of m and n from this equation which are equivalent to the m and n integral constraints of wmbls 3 1 n in convectively forced osbls the freely convecting planetary boundary layer is well studied previously using observations of the atmospheric boundary layer and les models the atmospheric observations show that the entrainment buoyancy flux is about 20 of the destabilizing surface buoyancy flux e g carson 1973 caughey and palmer 1979 a les study for the ocean boundary layer also found this ratio is approximately 20 noh et al 2010 it is important to distinguish that n is not this ratio of the surface to the entrainment flux and not 20 but rather n is the ratio of the integrated positive to the integrated negative buoyancy flux within the osbl we use this empirical relation to estimate n in section 3 1 1 in the case of convection with no mechanical forcing eq 23 simplifies to 24 m h b l n h b l 0 k ϕ min n 2 0 d z this relationship may be employed to estimate n from models that solve complete tke balance equations to predict kϕ such as described by section 2 2 we use this approach to estimate n in section 3 1 2 3 1 1 n estimated from historical observations in this section we use the empirical entrainment result to estimate n fig 3 is a schematic representation from atmospheric convection observations based on caughey and palmer 1979 their figure 3 where we invert their figure for the ocean the buoyancy flux profile decays linearly from the surface value to the entrainment depth in fig 3 the value hg represents the level where the buoyancy gradient changes sign below this depth denser water is entrained as the boundary layer expands the observations show that the entraining buoyancy flux peak is approximately 20 of the surface forcing bf stull 1976 caughey and palmer 1979 we infer that the depth of this peak must be about 1 2 hg since the flux profile is approximately linear the areas of the triangles in this representation are the integrated buoyant production area ag and integrated mixing m h b l area a m 1 a m 2 if we compute the area of ag using the height hg and the surface flux w b 0 we find an expression for the buoyant production 25 a g 1 2 w b 0 h g we compute the area a m1 using 20 of the surface flux and 20 of the vertical extent 26 a m 1 1 2 0 2 w b 0 0 2 h g there is also entrainment below the entrainment flux peak as it decays toward zero at the osbl base this entrainment region is labeled a m2 in fig 3 we assume that a m2 0 and a m2 a m1 we can thus estimate n is 0 04 n 0 08 from 27 n m h b l a g a m 1 a m 2 a g 3 1 2 computing n from k ϵ we now estimate n from one dimensional simulations using k ϵ with schumann and gerz 1995 stability functions see appendix b for model details we simulate the one dimensional model with various destabilizing heat fluxes and find n from eq 24 is nearly constant fig 4 we estimate n 0 066 for the range of heat fluxes simulated here which is within the estimated range from the observations we compare our estimate for the n parameter directly to b 1 of stull 1976 through n 1 b 1 using the symbols from their study a 1 is between 10 and 30 and b 1 1 a 1 2 is between 0 91 and 0 99 therefore n inferred from their study is within the range 0 01 to 0 09 which is consistent with our estimate here due to uncertainty in the region a m2 and the choice of 20 for entrainment surface flux ratio we therefore use a constant value of n 0 066 to parameterize the contribution of convection to m h b l 3 2 m for wind forced and rotating osbl the coefficient m for mechanically driven mixing includes the interaction of several physical mechanisms related to wind driven mixing in one coefficient it will vary depending on factors including surface currents stratification and surface waves when surface wave effects and horizontal processes are neglected as we have for this study the mechanically driven turbulence is entirely due to instabilities associated with vertical shear in the eulerian mean wind driven current previous studies e g gaspar 1988 often employ a constant m parameter one study modifies this approach by introducing an exponential function with an e folding depth set by the ekman length oberhuber 1993 which introduces mixing dependence on u f and hbl we will test these approaches by investigating m diagnostically from one dimensional simulations using the more complete k ϵ sg parameterization in this section we investigate cases where the water column is initially stable and there is no destabilizing buoyancy force in this case eq 23 reduces to 28 m h b l m u 3 this equation is then used to compute m from the k ϵ sg simulations where m h b l is known we then infer relations to parameterize m to emulate k ϵ sg without sensitivity to the time step in this section we only explore rotating simulations we discuss non rotating simulations in section 3 5 3 2 1 no buoyancy forcing we first investigate the scenario of a pure wind forced rotating column using one dimensional model simulations with k ϵ sg the model is simulated with four initial stratifications θ z 0 04 0 02 0 01 0 001 c m 1 three wind forcings τx 0 1 0 5 1 n m 2 and four coriolis frequencies latitudes of 10 30 60 90 n to investigate variability of m the results are averaged over an inertial period to mitigate the effect of inertial oscillations the values of m for all simulations after 10 model days are shown in fig 5 the value of m correlates with hbl f u indicating reduced osbl entrainment as hbl approaches the ekman depth u f when the mean wind input of mechanical energy to the currents is equal to the tke production the mean flow is in steady state with the turbulence darker shaded circles in fig 5 if the model is simulated until this criteria is reached the m values converge approximately to the red line function 29 m n c n 1 1 1 c n 2 exp c n 3 h b l f u 1 where c n 1 275 c n 2 8 and c n 3 5 the robustness of this fit 29 to the model output was tested to h b l f u 0 1 though significantly longer duration simulations are required to reach this criteria not shown when hbl f u is less than about 0 3 the time required for the tke production to equilibrate with the wind input is often long multiple inertial periods which equals weeks at 10 latitude and months at 1 latitude in this case the balanced relation red line 29 for m is exceeded due to excitement of the currents beyond the ekman balance augmenting the shear production it takes several inertial periods for this enhanced energy to be extracted from the mean shear and the inertial oscillations such that the shear production balances the mean wind input this effect is prominent when the inertial period is long i e in lower latitudes and it exists even if the wind speed is imposed gradually over an inertial period we might construct an alternate fit to the simulation data which depends on the 10 day forcing time period of this experiment 30 m n b c n b 1 exp c n b 2 h b l f u where c n b 1 5 and c n b 2 3 in the blue line in fig 5 the fit of the data to this function is highly dependent on the duration of the simulation for a general application this approach is therefore not advisable this result confirms that transience and hysteresis are important in determining m particularly at lower latitudes 3 2 2 stabilizing buoyancy forcing we next investigate cases that include a stabilizing surface buoyancy flux in this case we introduce an additional external parameter bf we compute m from the k ϵ sg simulations for models with the identical four initial stratifications three wind speeds and four latitudes as in the previous section we also introduce four stabilizing heat fluxes 25 50 75 100 w m 2 we first show the value of m plotted against hbl f u fig 6 left panel the scaling for m is different from that found in the neutral case fig 5 the dashed red curve in fig 6 left panel is the curve found for the neutral m eq 29 this curve is the lower limit of m in this regime at a given hbl f u suggesting the effect of the stabilizing heat flux is to increase m from the neutral value and supporting the m n fit to h b l f u 0 15 we subtract the value of m n from the total m and plot the residual m s m m n against the non dimensional relation u 5 f b f 2 h b l the non dimensional relation u 5 f b f 2 h b l is the relevant non dimensional parameter combination using scaling arguments from the shear production equivalent to the obukhov length squared over the ekman depth times the boundary layer depth this relation correlates well with the model data and can therefore be used to parameterize m s fig 6 right panel this indicates that the fractional potential energy change due to turbulence mixing increases either when the obukhov length is reduced more stratification to mix or when the ekman depth or boundary layer depth are increased more energy available to mix in the stabilizing regime the computed m correlates well to the relationship 31 m s c s 1 b f 2 h b l u 5 f c s 2 b f 0 to parameterize m s in the presence of a stabilizing surface flux and rotation green dashed line in fig 6 where c s 1 0 2 and c s 2 0 4 this relationship 31 is applicable for a stabilizing surface buoyancy flux only the destabilizing flux is discussed in section 3 3 and m s 0 otherwise this fit is confirmed from simulations after roughly one inertial period spin up from rest and tested with heat fluxes from 0 to 1000 w m 2 at 1 90 latitude this fit is never valid at f 0 since the criteria for sustained forcing over multiple inertial cycles is not possible furthermore forcing time scales are not often equivalent to inertial time scales at near equatorial latitudes 3 3 coincident wind forcing with convection we now consider the case with both wind forced turbulence and convective turbulence if we employ n 0 066 and the m relationship from neutral forcing 30 we over estimate the total mixing in this scenario one reason for over estimating the mixing is straightforward when the wind generates currents the shear instabilities generate tke a fraction of this tke is dissipated and the remainder is available to mix stable stratification and create potential energy when there is a destabilizing surface buoyancy flux the mean stratification is unstable near the surface and therefore there is less stable stratification to mix the reduction of near surface stable stratification in the presence of convection means the fraction of wind driven tke converted to potential energy may be reduced relative to the neutral case the total tke and total mixing increases relative to the individual wind or convection alone cases but it is less than the sum of the individual processes this simple explanation does not consider the interaction between shear driven and convectively driven turbulent processes it also ignores tke flux away from the source region into the stable stratification below that mitigates this effect however this explanation may be used to approximate the effect of convection on mechanically driven mixing to demonstrate how significant the over estimated mixing is we compute m h b l over a range of both heating and cooling scenarios 100 to 100 w m 2 with a range of wind forcing and latitudes we compare m h b l predicted using n of 0 066 and m m n m s from eqs 29 and 31 in eq 23 to that computed directly from the k ϵ sg simulations for the cases with destabilizing heat fluxes the new formulation predicts more mixing than k ϵ sg fig 7 left we confirm that the primary cause is the overestimated mechanical mixing by setting n 0 in eq 23 in this case we neglect the contribution of convection but still predict a greater m h b l relative to k ϵ sg fig 7 right this result shows that even when the mechanically driven dominates it can be significantly reduced due to convection 3 4 parameterizing the reduction of m due to convection in this section we investigate the reduction of m due to convection we will examine the profile of the buoyancy flux after 10 days of simulation in both neutral and destabilizing wind forced k ϵ sg cases for a neutral case fig 8 black line we find a nearly linear profile in depth of the buoyancy flux to the mixing depth the value m h b l m u 3 is the area under this region if we approximate this area as triangular we can write m h b l 1 2 w h b l where w is width and hbl is height in which case 32 m h b l m u 3 1 2 h b l w the value of w here therefore equals 2 m u 3 h b l for a case with a convective surface flux fig 8 blue line we find that a fraction of the osbl has a positive destabilizing buoyancy flux in the region with positive buoyancy flux the turbulence drives potential energy release due to gravitational instability in this region no net tke conversion to potential energy occurs the vertical thickness of the region with negative w b is greatly reduced by the presence of surface cooling we use this knowledge to approximate the reduction of m proportionally to the fraction of the osbl thickness with unstable stratification we also note that the value of the buoyancy flux at the base of the osbl is only slightly increased due to the addition of convection e g width w the increase in this width will depend on the ratio of mechanical forcing to buoyancy forcing of osbl turbulence or the ratio of the obukhov depth and the boundary layer depth u 3 κ b f h b l we look at the effect of combined mechanical and buoyancy forcing more carefully in fig 9 the surface value of w b is by definition the negative of surface flux bf the value of w is hypothesized to remain approximately 2 m u 3 h b l ignoring additional contribution by the buoyancy flux to the entrainment flux if we know hbl the area of a in this diagram can be found without knowing hm or hg if the buoyancy is changing at a uniform rate in the boundary layer h g b f must equal h b l 2 m u 3 h b l b f where bf is negative in convection using these relationships the value of hg is written 33 h g b f h b l b f 2 m u 3 h b l from this expression we find the value of hm 34 h m h b l 2 m u 3 h b l b f 2 m u 3 h b l now to get a or equivalently m h b l we multiply 1 2 h m 2 m u 3 h b l 35 m h b l m u 3 2 m u 3 h b l b f 2 m u 3 h b l for this derivation we assumed that there was no additional downward flux of tke to mitigate the effect we discuss here one method to parameterize this reduction is to introduce a fractional positive constant to the buoyancy flux in the denominator 0 cψ 1 which serves to represent the impact of interactions with dissipation the ignored convective contribution to tke increase and other turbulent processes introducing this constant which we estimate to be 0 67 in the k ϵ sg simulations the quantity ψ h m h b l is written 36 ψ 2 m u 3 c ψ max 0 b f h b l 2 m u 3 this correction is then multiplied by m in the presence of a destabilizing surface buoyancy flux to approximate the reduction due to interaction of convective and wind driven processes in the simulations explored here this effect is important during even relatively weak destabilizing surface buoyancy fluxes to correctly predict m h b l we apply this correction to eliminate the over estimation of m h b l fig 10 the reduction of m does not imply reduced total tke relative to the isolated convection or wind forced case it is fundamentally similar but opposite to the enhancement of m found during a stabilizing buoyancy flux 3 5 non rotating cases in this section we presented relations that are used to parameterize variability in m for cases with f 0 we did not explore in detail the value of m when f 0 the behavior of the m coefficient is quite different between these two regimes at the equator skillful parameterization for m not shown correlates with hn 0 u where n 0 is the characteristic buoyancy frequency of the entrained water following pollard et al 1972 we deliberately do not investigate details of this scaling since there is no obvious transition between n 0 based scaling and f based scaling in the following section we present a method to infer mixing coefficient profiles from the wmbl method and the n and m values estimated in this section 4 a framework to predict turbulent mixing in climate simulations for climate simulations we propose that a useful parameterization is one that consistently simulates the energetics of turbulent mixing independent of time step and resolution we use the results of the previous sections to construct a vertical profile of the mixing coefficient that provides a numerically insensitive mixing parameterization the full mixing parameterizations will include contributions to the total osbl mixing coefficient from a new osbl parameterization hereafter the energetic planetary boundary layer or epbl with the resolved shear driven mixing parameterization of jhl we define the vertical profile of the vertical turbulent mixing coefficient for use in an ocean climate model as 37 k z f x k e p b l z k j h l z k n z where fx is a yet to be determined functional form kepbl is a mixing coefficient motivated by wmbls introduced in this section kjhl is the resolved shear driven mixing coefficient of jhl and kn represents mixing from arbitrary other sources the implementation of the jhl parameterization is not employed for convective conditions and is sensitive to resolution and time step when f 0 see section 2 the kepbl component of the parameterization therefore deliberately targets these two tasks for a climate model the kepbl component is a boundary layer mixing parameterization and is only intended to predict mixing in the osbl driven by the surface fluxes therefore the kjhl component and kn component are always required for turbulent mixing due to processes including internal shear driven mixing jhl and internal wave breaking we express the total mixing coefficient using an undefined function in eq 37 to emphasize that it is not generally sufficient to use a linear combination of mixing coefficients from separate energy sources when they occur together e g as shown in section 3 3 for convective and mechanical turbulence 4 1 the epbl mixing coefficient the epbl mixing coefficient is inspired by the wmbl approach and its insensitivity to long time steps and coarse vertical resolution here we will relax the assumption in wmbls of vertical homogeneity within the osbl motivated by hallberg 2003 the critical component of epbl is that the mixing coefficient and the depth of the boundary layer are explicitly constrained to satisfy the potential energy change due to turbulent mixing imposed using eq 23 we define the epbl mixing coefficient using the general form of 38 k e p b l z c k w t l where wt is a turbulent velocity scale and ck is a coefficient in kpp a non gradient mixing contribution is included to more accurately parameterize convection see large et al 1994 we neglect this component here as it does not significantly affect our results and its accurate parameterization in the ocean remains a topic of research e g van roekel et al 2018 epbl is designed to constrain the total potential energy change due to turbulent mixing and solve implicitly for the impacts of mixing on the density and velocity profiles without sensitivity to vertical resolution and time step the primary purpose of section 3 is to establish methods for parameterizing m and n to serve as the energetic constraint for vertical mixing in climate simulations in this subsection we present a method to estimate the vertical profile of the turbulent mixing coefficients kepbl the exact value of the mixing coefficient and therefore the values of wt and l in eq 38 are not critical for maintaining the integrated potential energy change constraint however the vertical profile of the mixing coefficient is important as it determines the vertical profile of the mean current and scalars near the surface 4 2 defining the turbulent length scale we begin by assuming the mixing length follows wall theory near the surface l z this approach is simplistic in the real ocean due to the presence of wave breaking and langmuir turbulence e g craig and banner 1994 sullivan et al 2007 the wave effects can be parameterized using a minimum roughness length z 0 if law of the wall is also a reasonable approximation for the mixing length at the lower boundary of the osbl we can use a length scale equation of 39 l z 0 z h b l z h b l this profile is expressed in a general way as 40 l z 0 z h b l z h b l γ where γ is the coefficient that determines the profile setting γ 2 gives a mixing length profile similar to that of kpp large et al 1994 k ϵ sg simulations simulations indicate that the value of γ is variable depending on factors such as latitude and buoyancy flux these details introduce only small errors in the context of this study and therefore are not investigated the mixing length does not typically become zero at the bottom of the osbl which may be either the ocean interior or the ocean bottom we therefore introduce a bottom length scale lb which can depend on bottom roughness or local stratification 41 l z 0 z max l b h b l h b l z h b l γ alternative approaches e g gaspar et al 1990 may also be employed to estimate the length scale we choose the form 41 since it is simple to implement in an ocean model and our results are consistent with the k ϵ sg approach see section 5 4 3 defining the turbulent velocity scale we do not predict the tke prognostically and therefore approximate the vertical tke profile to estimate wt an estimate for the mechanical contribution to the velocity scale follows the standard two equation approach in one and two equation second order k parameterizations the boundary condition for the tke is typically employed as a flux boundary condition 42 k k z z 0 c μ 0 u 3 the profile of k decays in the vertical from k c μ 0 2 3 u 2 toward the base of the osbl here we assume a similar relationship to estimate the mechanical contribution to the tke profile the value of wt due to mechanical sources v is estimated as v z 0 c μ 0 1 3 u at the surface since we only parameterize osbl turbulent mixing due to surface forcing the value of the velocity scale is assumed to decay moving away from the surface for simplicity we employ a linear decay in depth 43 v z c μ 0 1 3 u 1 a min 1 z h b l where 1 a 0 has the effect of making v z h b l 0 making the constant coefficient a close to one has the effect of reducing the mixing rate near the base of the boundary layer thus producing a more diffuse entrainment region making a close to zero has the effect of increasing the mixing at the base of the boundary layer producing a more step like entrainment region an estimate for the buoyancy contribution is found utilizing the convective velocity scale 44 w z c w z 0 w b d z 1 3 where c w is a non dimensional empirical coefficient convection in one and two equation closure causes a tke profile that peaks below the surface the quantity w b is solved for in epbl as kn 2 these choices for the convective and mechanical components of the velocity scale in the osbl are then added together to get an estimate for the total turbulent velocity scale 45 w t z w z v z this approach to diagnose a turbulent velocity scale is highly empirical and is therefore not expected to satisfy all general properties of turbulence theory in reality the two effects are not linearly summed however this approximation is reasonable to estimate of the velocity scale for this purpose the value of a in eq 43 is arbitrarily chosen to be 0 95 here we explored the use of alternative velocity scales such as kpp which extends similarity theory through the boundary layer and find little sensitivity over a wide range of realistic conditions future research efforts will investigate methods to improved the estimate of wt such as the effect of surface waves 4 4 summarizing the epbl implementation we now review the findings of this section and summarize the epbl framework we implement in our model the epbl mixing coefficient 38 is found by multiplying a velocity scale eq 45 by a length scale eq 41 the precise value of the coefficient ck in eq 38 does not significantly alter the prescribed potential energy change constraint a reasonable value is ck 0 55 to be consistent with other approaches e g umlauf et al 2005 the boundary layer thickness hbl within epbl is based on the depth where the energy requirement for turbulent mixing of density exceeds the available energy following eq 23 hbl is determined by the energetic constraint imposed using the values of n and m an iterative solver is required because m and the mixing length are dependent on hbl we use a constant value for convectively driven tke of n 0 066 the parameterizations for m are formulated specifically for the regimes where kjhl is sensitive to model numerics f δt 1 we find a neutral value for m given by eq 29 which is augmented under surface heating by eq 31 and reduced under convection by eq 36 4 5 combining the epbl and jhl mixing coefficients we now address the combination of the epbl mixing coefficient and the jhl mixing coefficient the function fx in eq 37 cannot be the linear sum of kepbl and kjhl one reason this sum is not valid is because the jhl mixing coefficient is determined by resolved current shear including that driven by the surface wind the wind driven current is also included in the epbl mixing coefficient formulation an alternative approach is therefore needed to avoid double counting kepbl is not used at the equator here as scalings are only investigated when f 0 the solution we employ is to use the maximum mixing coefficient of the two contributions 46 k z max k e p b l z k j h l z where m and hence kepbl is constrained to be small as f 0 this form uses the jhl mixing coefficient when the epbl coefficient is small eq 46 is a reasonable approach when the wind driven mixing dominates since both jhl and epbl give a similar solution when deployed optimally one weakness of this approach is the tropical region where the shear driven epbl m coefficient is not formulated the jhl parameterization is skillful to simulate this mixing but does not include the contribution of convection the convective portion of kepbl should be combined with kjhl in the equatorial region when shear and convection occur together though they are not linearly summed see fig 7 in this study we always employ the maximum value 46 since the mixing coefficient is consistent with the k ϵ sg approach despite this limitation section 5 future research will investigate more complete integration of the kepbl and kjhl energetics 5 evaluation of epbl against k ϵ we now evaluate epbl through comparison with a model using the k ϵ sg parameterization the k ϵ sg simulations are used to find m and n and determine the coefficients for epbl therefore inter comparison of free running simulations utilizing both k ϵ sg and epbl is a logical metric for evaluating epbl s capability to reproduce the k ϵ sg energetic constraint and test sensitivity to time step and vertical resolution the epbl parameterization is included in a one dimensional version of the mom6 ocean model adcroft et al 2018 here we show results where the mom6 model has been simulated with two set ups first we employ a 1 m constant vertical grid spacing and 1200 s time step the second set up tests coarse resolution used for climate models and employs a 10 m vertical grid spacing and a 7200 s time step the k ϵ experiments are run with a 1 m vertical grid spacing and a 10 s time step which ensures that the evolution of the turbulent quantities with the mean ocean state are accurately captured fig 2 for all simulations here the column is initialized with a constant stable stratification of 0 01 c m 1 we begin with a broad model inter comparison and then focus on several case studies for the broad comparison we vary the surface heat flux from 100 to 100 w m 2 in increments of 25 w m 2 to encompass a range from stabilizing to convecting we choose a moderate wind stress for this demonstration of 0 2 n m 2 u 10 10 m s 1 which allows for a range of relative strengths of mechanical and buoyancy forced turbulence to be tested this range of conditions is limited to relatively deep obukhov depths lo 25 l o u 3 κ b f in both stabilizing or destabilizing regimes in strongly destabilizing regimes the value of n for this parameterization is well constrained and the effect of mechanical mixing is minimal strongly stabilizing regimes in the realistic ocean heat fluxes 500 w m2 and wind speeds 5 m s are resistant to turbulent mixing below just a few meters and therefore are not included in this comparison we simulate the set up for latitudes ranging from the equator to 90 in 10 increments the average temperature over the top 10 m after 10 simulation days is compared from all 90 simulations to evaluate model performance we first show the resulting temperature change and the final osbl depth after 10 simulation days using the k ϵ sg model for all 90 simulations fig 11 there is significant variability in the osbl depth left panel over the simulations where rotation wind forcing and buoyancy fluxes all contribute in various regimes the temperature change right panel ranges from surface cooling of up to about 1 c to surface warming of a fraction of 1 c we simulate mom6 experiments with i jhl only no kepbl ii epbl only no kjhl and iii with the full set up employing the maximum turbulent mixing coefficient predicted from epbl and jhl eq 46 in the second and third case the convective turbulence is parameterized with a value of n 0 066 jhl is meant to parameterize mixing due to shear instability only 5 1 broad comparison k ϵ vs jhl epbl and jhl epbl we begin with a comparison using epbl and jhl at identical 1 m grid spacing to the k ϵ model the energetic constraints in epbl are not sensitive to the grid thickness but the simulation of cooling and heating in the model is therefore we first compare the similar model set up in these simulations the model with jhl performs well relative to the k ϵ sg simulations in the lower latitudes fig 12 upper left panel the jhl scheme does not perform well away from the equator particularly in the presence of surface heating one reason is that jhl performance is limited by the longer time step jhl w 1200 s and k ϵ sg with 10 s when the model is simulated with epbl alone we find the opposite result to using jhl fig 12 upper center panel the epbl scheme performs well away from the equator but has not been designed for the regime where f becomes small the surface temperature differences with epbl jhl are small relative to k ϵ sg for all cases simulated this result shows that the two parameterizations work in tandem to produce a good result fig 12 upper right panel we next show the simulations using a 10 m grid spacing and 7200 s time step in mom6 fig 12 bottom panels in this case the performance of jhl away from the equator is degraded left panels the epbl performance remains consistent with the previous experiment center panels the epbl jhl result remains reasonable compared to k ϵ sg showing that this framework is reasonable even at the coarse vertical grids and long time steps of ocean climate models 5 2 case study 1 convection we now present vertical profiles of the quantities simulated by the column models to demonstrate select results for the full column first we show a case with a surface wind stress of 0 2 n m 2 and surface buoyancy flux of 100 w m 2 cooling located at 40 n fig 13 for each scheme in mom6 epbl jhl epbl jhl we present the results using a 1200 s time step and 1 m vertical grid spacing dashed lines for the combined jhl epbl approach we also include a 7200 s time step and 10 m vertical grid spacing x s the jhl scheme is clearly inadequate for this case because it neglects convectively driven tke in this case epbl closely matches the mixing predicted by k ϵ sg the mixing coefficients near the base of the osbl are different which is primarily due to the k ϵ sg stability functions in k ϵ sg the turbulent diffusivity is computed from the turbulent viscosity through a prandtl number as a function of the richardson number in the other simulations the prandtl number is assumed one for simplicity the temperature and current profiles are not very sensitive to this difference showing the parameterization works as intended despite this simplification 5 3 case study 2 equatorial wind driven next we investigate the neutral no buoyancy force case with a wind stress of 0 2 n m 2 at the equator fig 14 the epbl parameterization by itself is inadequate at this location because the coriolis frequency tends towards zero and no parameterization has been provided for this regime the model with the epbl parameterization only blue therefore performs poorly the model with epbl and jhl green agrees with the jhl only model red showing that jhl sufficiently controls the mixing via 46 the jhl experiment performs well relative to k ϵ sg and shows little sensitivity to the tested time step differences 5 4 case study 3 mid latitude wind driven stabilizing buoyancy flux finally we show the simulation with a warming surface sensible heat flux of 100 w m 2 and a 0 2 n m 2 wind stress located at 40 n fig 15 here we find that the model with the jhl scheme alone is unable to predict the proper mixing coefficient due to the long time step we find that using epbl alone in the model compares closer to the k ϵ result using epbl in tandem with jhl is not significantly different from epbl alone supporting the maximum value approach of 46 the shape of the mixing coefficient is similar between the epbl formulations and k ϵ sg 6 discussion we introduce a framework for the osbl that emphasizes constraining the potential energy change by turbulent mixing for climate model applications the epbl component exploits relationships between this mixing constraint and external parameters we also employ an existing parameterization jhl that resolves shear driven mixing with limited sensitivity to model time step when the coriolis parameter is small the epbl method mitigates model sensitivity to time step and vertical resolution epbl therefore can supplement prognostic tke based parameterizations like jhl or k ϵ in climate simulations the new parameterization is demonstrated to simulate energetically consistent boundary layer mixing with time steps as long as 7200 s and grid spacing as coarse as 10 m we have not addressed several aspects that are relevant for general osbl modeling for example we deliberately exclude horizontal property gradients in this study processes related to horizontal gradients ocean fronts are important in the osbl and alternative schemes are required to include these effects in ocean models e g fox kemper et al 2011 bachman et al 2017 we review additional considerations that require investigation to improve model performance in this section 6 1 effects of surface waves in epbl wave breaking see craig and banner 1994 melville 1996 terray et al 1996 and langmuir turbulence see craik and leibovich 1976 skyllingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 belcher et al 2012 d asaro et al 2014 are important components of upper ocean turbulence and mixing breaking surface waves inject turbulent energy at the ocean surface with vertical dissipation scaling with the wave height see craig and banner 1994 terray et al 1996 melville 1996 langmuir turbulence which is due to interaction of wave driven stokes drift with background turbulence impacts osbl dynamics through counter rotating vortices with spatial scales of the osbl thickness these structures lead to enhanced vertical velocities and entrainment skyllingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 modifications to include langmuir turbulence in second order closure kantha and clayson 2004 harcourt 2013 2015 and kpp reichl et al 2016 li et al 2016 emphasize its importance for osbl parameterization on both weather and climate scales it is hypothesized that turbulence due to langmuir circulations interacts with turbulence due to wave breaking further enhancing mixing and entrainment noh et al 2004 sullivan et al 2007 mcwilliams et al 2012 recent studies demonstrate that wave enhanced osbl parameterizations improve ocean climate simulations particularly in high latitudes fan and griffies 2014 li et al 2016 the epbl framework will require modification to include the contribution of waves to osbl mixing for realistic climate implementation this can be done by introducing an additional stokes production term with properly calibrated dissipation in eq 23 this modification results in an additional m source related to the langmuir number the non dimensional relationship between stokes and shear production for brevity we reserve presentation of the surface wave effect within this framework for a separate study 6 2 transient forcing in epbl in tropical regions we found significant transient variability in m due to the long inertial period in extra tropical regions transient processes can produce inertial resonance contributing to enhanced turbulent entrainment see skyllingstad et al 2000 predicting m for this scenario would require a flow dependent parameter to be considered possibly using the wind energy input term this process could be incorporated within the epbl framework to improve performance for mesoscale ocean dynamics and finer submesoscale fronts and filaments the transient forcing scenario will require attention if this scheme is utilized in models with fine horizontal resolution 10 km the effect of the diurnal cycle is also important in near surface mixing and may require further modification to the epbl approach although it is currently in use in a coupled climate model with a diurnal cycle and provides reasonable performance adcroft et al in prep the transient events may average out in long simulations but due to hysteresis effects such as ocean heat uptake under storms e g bueti et al 2014 this scenario requires careful consideration for climate models at high storm resolving resolutions it is possible that the effects of transient forcing are too complex for the simple epbl framework in this case alternative methods to mitigate time step sensitivity to vertical mixing will be required one possibility is to introduce convection to jhl and to investigate methods to mitigate degraded performance in the presence of rotation 6 3 length and velocity scales in epbl the epbl mixing length scale is estimated from the distance between the surface and the osbl depth the velocity scale is estimated based on the buoyancy production and surface wind stress in the test scenarios explored here this approach provides reasonable vertical distribution of the mixing coefficients in the ocean the mixing length and velocity scale are dependent on characteristics of the turbulence including whether it is mechanically driven or buoyancy driven moeng and sullivan 1994 and the effect of surface waves craig and banner 1994 reichl et al 2016 the length scale and the velocity scale and the sensitivity of the resultant model to the mixing coefficients need to be explored further in realistic climate simulations 7 conclusion the energetic planetary boundary layer epbl framework is designed to provide the vertical mixing coefficient used to simulate the impact of ocean surface boundary layer osbl turbulence in ocean climate simulations computational restrictions in climate models dictate vertical resolution and time steps that are sub optimal for use of prognostic tke turbulence closure methods see fig 2 the time step sensitivity of tke closure is most notable in extra tropical regions where there is coupling between turbulence evolution and rotational effects on the mean state we develop an alternative parameterization for this regime which is combined with an equilibrium resolved shear parameterization jackson et al 2008 to provide global estimates of osbl mixing coefficients with little sensitivity to vertical resolution and time step the vertical profile of the mixing coefficient satisfies mixing constraints based on the increase in potential energy due to turbulent mixing two turbulent generation processes are included here shear production and buoyant production contributions due to other processes including surface waves are not included though are not precluded as an extension of this work the shear production is included by parameterizing the energy available for mixing from the osbl thickness the surface friction velocity the coriolis frequency and the surface buoyancy flux we have demonstrated that these factors provide an accurate parameterization for parameter m of the energy available for mixing in extra tropical regions see section 4 4 the convective contribution to the tke budget is estimated based on previous observational results and simulations using k ϵ sg we find that the n parameter the fraction of convectively released tke converted to potential energy is approximately constant with a value of 0 066 these values of m and n are used to determine the turbulent mixing coefficients

parameterize in epbl is the tke that contributes to buoyancy mixing conversion to potential energy third term from right for kϕn 2 0 in order to determine that this term is larger than the storage lhs in the tke budget we plot these two terms over the first 12 hours after forcing is applied for this experiment we conduct 6 simulations we vary the forcing to investigate weak shear driven 0 05 n m 2 strong shear driven 0 2 n m 2 and shear and buoyancy driven 0 05 n m 2 and 100 w m 2 cases we conduct each case with both equatorial and high latitude 60 coriolis parameters comparing the magnitude of the mixing component of the tke budget to the time storage term we see that the mixing term overtakes the storage term for all scenarios beginning at two hours of simulation the production and dissipation terms are not shown but are significantly larger than either term investigated here therefore we conclude that using a steady state tke budget in our model is likely to be reasonable as long as we are interested in processes with timescales longer than one to two hours 
24072,this paper presents a method to parameterize vertical turbulent mixing coefficients within the ocean surface boundary layer osbl for climate applications the new method is specifically constructed to satisfy two requirements the first aspect is to explicitly consider the mechanical energy budget of the turbulence that drives mixing this constraint ensures a realistic and robust simulation of the osbl which is critical for coupled climate simulations the second aspect is that the model should be formulated so that it is not sensitive to the numerical limitations common to climate simulations such as long time steps and coarse vertical grids this goal is achieved by combining an existing resolved shear driven mixing parameterization here jackson et al 2008 with a new method to avoid time step sensitivity the new method is motivated by the kraus turner niiler type bulk boundary layer parameterization but relaxes the requirement for vertical homogeneity the non dimensional coefficients m and n from the kraus turner niiler approach are parameterized for the new method based on results of simulations using a previously tested parameterization at high resolution the resulting parameterization is evaluated by comparing simulations with the new parameterization to simulations with the k ϵ parameterization over a wide range of combinations of surface wind stress surface buoyancy flux and latitudes the new method for vertical turbulent osbl mixing is therefore proposed as a computationally efficient implicitly energetically constrained option appropriate for ocean climate modeling applications keywords vertical mixing parameterization upper ocean turbulent boundary layer 1 introduction the ocean surface boundary layer osbl is the only part of the ocean directly influenced by the atmosphere it is also a region where turbulent energy and dissipation often exceeds the ocean interior values by several orders of magnitude this elevated turbulence leads to a fundamentally unique regime where distinct physical processes govern the dynamics compared to the interior e g moum and smyth 2001 soloviev and lukas 2013 the osbl is bounded at its surface by the air sea interface while the bottom boundary is typically constrained by strong density gradients the vigorous turbulence results in significant mixing within this layer combining properties modified by the atmosphere above and entrainment from the ocean interior below the physics that govern this regime couple processes spanning from the small scale of dissipation to eddies as large as the boundary layer for simulating large scale ocean climate current computational allocations dictate the use of hydrostatic momentum equations discretized with horizontal grid spacing between 25 100 km and variable vertical grid spacing between 1 100 m e g griffies et al 2016 the vertical grid spacing may be finest within the boundary layers to resolve important near surface processes and coarsest in the interior this grid does not resolve osbl turbulence requiring the effect of turbulence on ocean evolution to be simulated using boundary layer parameterization 1 1 boundary layer parameterizations the leading order mean osbl equation for arbitrary scalar ϕ assuming a horizontally homogenous distribution is 1 ϕ t z w ϕ ν ϕ 2 ϕ z 2 where νϕ is the molecular diffusivity w is the vertical velocity and w and ϕ are fluctuations from ensemble averages w and ϕ this equation describes the evolution of mean quantity ϕ due to vertical processes including the divergence of the turbulent flux covariance term and often negligible molecular mixing a challenge common to simulating any turbulent fluid at resolutions coarser than those required for dns direct numerical simulation where turbulent fluxes are entirely resolved is to skillfully parameterize the turbulent fluxes the turbulence closure problem for practical oceanographic applications this parameterization must emphasize computational efficiency there is a wide range of approaches that are employed to parameterize turbulent fluxes for ocean simulations see burchard et al 2008 here we focus on energetics based osbl parameterizations the downward turbulent flux of buoyant water by osbl turbulence converts mechanical energy into potential energy as it mixes with less buoyant water at the base of the osbl we focus on osbl parameterizations that constrain this integrated potential energy conversion due to turbulent mixing a simple method employed by several older generation basin and global scale ocean models is the kraus turner niiler well mixed boundary layer parameterization kraus and turner 1967 niiler and kraus 1977 the kraus turner niiler method assumes no vertical property gradients inside a well mixed osbl the relative simplicity of this approach facilitates implementation of exact implicit solvers for the potential energy change due to turbulent mixing in the water column simulations employing this scheme are therefore not significantly degraded by coarse vertical resolution and long time steps another approach follows the boussinesq hypothesis boussinesq 1877 for turbulence closure this hypothesis approximates the reynolds stress terms using an eddy viscosity eddy diffusivity for turbulent scalar fluxes 1 1 see schmitt 2007 for discussion on the historical connection between j boussinesq s hypothesis and o reynold s work the reynolds stress is parameterized as down gradient of the mean velocity profile as an analogue to molecular viscosity 2 u i w k m u i z where ui are the horizontal components of the velocity similarly the eddy diffusivity is used to parameterize turbulent scalar fluxes as 3 ϕ w k ϕ ϕ z the parameters needed to close the system of equations are then reduced to the turbulent mixing coefficients kϕ and km first order approaches determine these coefficients based on mean flow parameters such as in the k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 and pacanowski and philander 1981 however first order approaches do not typically consider the change of the potential energy in the water column due to turbulent mixing second order 2 2 here we adopt the colloquial terminology of order that is common in the literature though formally these parameterizations are referred to by their moment parameterizations formulate equations to predict the mixing coefficients using second moment turbulent quantities such as the turbulent kinetic energy tke these approaches explicitly consider energetic constraints of turbulent mixing via the mechanical tke conservation equation discussed further in section 2 2 the most complex approaches of this nature are based on a consistent mathematical framework to express the coupled differential equations for the turbulent fluxes these approaches are summarized by the systematic level of closure description proposed by mellor and yamada 1974 see also galperin et al 1988 canuto et al 2001 several types of second order turbulent closure have been applied to oceanic boundary layers most notably mellor yamada k kl see mellor and yamada 1982 kantha and clayson 1994 and canuto et al 2001 k ϵ e g rodi 1987 and burchard and baumert 1995 k ω e g wilcox 1988 and umlauf and burchard 2003 and the generic length scale gls e g umlauf and burchard 2003 and kantha 2004 for climate simulation there are computational challenges that discourage use of second order osbl parameterization second order approaches are most often employed for coastal ocean models where numerical stability restrictions with horizontal grid spacing less than 1 km dictate model time steps on the order of minutes for the dynamics which approximately corresponds to timescales of turbulence evolution global models with a grid spacing of 25 km or more permit dynamics time steps greater than 1000 s and thermodynamic mixing time steps exceeding one hour the large time steps limit the use of the second order approach in global models since the timescales of tke evolution are unresolved see reffray et al 2015 boundary layer parameterizations that require short time steps in ocean models make the resultant model impractical for studying climate timescale phenomenon several approximations and simplifications have been proposed to ease the computational burden associated with second order methods see gaspar et al 1990 d alessio et al 1998 however these models remain sensitive to the time step due to the coupled evolution of the turbulence and the mean fields see reffray et al 2015 one second order method we will discuss further in section 2 3 is specifically formulated to employ in climate models jackson et al 2008 hereafter jhl jhl has not previously been implemented for turbulent mixing in the osbl surface waves are known to significantly impact the dynamics of the osbl belcher et al 2012 d asaro et al 2014 recent studies have demonstrated the importance of wave effects to improve biases in ocean mixing in climate models fan and griffies 2014 li et al 2016 these studies both employed the first order kpp parameterization modified to include the effect of surface waves for brevity we reserve discussion of parameterization of the effect of waves within climate models for a separate study the limitations of neglecting wave effects are discussed further in section 6 1 1 2 outline we present here a framework to parameterize osbl turbulent mixing for climate models our approach is motivated to satisfy two criteria first it must maintain a realistic constraint on potential energy change due to turbulent mixing in the osbl second the computational requirement of the parameterization must be low relative to other components of the ocean model moreover it must accurately represent the effects of turbulence in models that operate with the time step that characterizes the dynamics of the ocean climate system about one hour we begin section 2 with a review of mechanical energy based osbl parameterizations we demonstrate that the well mixed boundary layer framework is skillful for limiting sensitivity of osbl parameterization to time step and vertical resolution in section 3 we investigate the energetic constraints imposed in the well mixed boundary layer formulation in section 4 we describe a new method to extend the well mixed boundary layer parameterization to simulations that do not require a homogenous osbl finally in section 5 the capabilities of this method are tested against a commonly used second order turbulent mixing parameterization run with fine vertical resolution and small time step the k ϵ parameterization with schumann and gerz 1995 stability functions the result of this study is the formulation of a simplified implicit energetics based method to parameterize the effects of turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer that can be implemented with minimal computational overhead and minimal resolution sensitivity for coupled ocean climate simulations 2 energetically constrained osbl parameterizations for climate models the energetics of osbl turbulence are described by the mechanical tke conservation equation see rodi 1987 4 k t z k m σ k k z u i w u i z w b ϵ where k is the tke σk is the turbulent schmidt number b is the buoyancy and ϵ is the turbulent dissipation rate the terms in this equation represent tke storage lhs tke flux convergence rhs 1st shear production rhs 2nd buoyancy production rhs 3rd and dissipation rhs 4th the term that contributes to potential energy conversion is the buoyancy production term we review three types of energetically constrained mixing parameterizations in this section that consider the effect of this buoyancy term on ocean energetics we start by reviewing the well mixed boundary layer approach section 2 1 this approach integrates the osbl and applies eq 4 to predict an entrainment velocity second we review approaches that solve eq 4 and use the tke to constrain the turbulent mixing section 2 2 finally we review another method based on eq 4 but that makes simplifications targeted for implementation in climate model configurations section 2 3 we restrict discussion in this section to schemes that are energetically constrained therefore first order parameterizations such as kpp large et al 1994 are not discussed in detail these parameterizations use energetically motivated richardson number arguments to predict the mixing coefficients however they do not explicitly consider the effect of the mixing coefficient on the potential energy conversion in the water column 2 1 well mixed boundary layers wmbls the well mixed boundary layer wmbl parameterization 3 3 historically these are often called mixed layer or bulk mixed layer parameterization we prefer well mixed boundary layer to be consistent with parameterizations that do not require a vertically homogenous osbl is described in detail in several previous studies see kraus and turner 1967 niiler and kraus 1977 garwood 1977 deardorff 1983 gaspar 1988 oberhuber 1993 wmbls assume that the osbl is vertically homogeneous which simplifies the ocean model by simulating only vertical integrals within the osbl the integral of eq 1 for ϕ over the osbl thickness hbl is 5 h b l 0 ϕ t d z h b l 0 z ϕ w d z where ensemble averages are assumed ϕ w and the molecular component is assumed small large reynolds number the quantity ϕ is assumed uniform in this layer so eq 5 is written e g gaspar 1988 6 ϕ t 1 h b l ϕ w 0 ϕ w b l where denotes a vertically averaged quantity the turbulent boundary conditions are the only turbulence quantities retained in 6 the prescribed surface flux arises from air sea and ice sea exchange of matter energy and momentum the bottom turbulent entrainment flux in wmbls are written in jump form following niiler and kraus 1977 7 ϕ w b l w e ϕ ϕ i w e δ ϕ where ϕi is the interior value of ϕ and we is the entrainment velocity the entrainment velocity is the only turbulent quantity requiring closure in wmbls this term is the time derivative of the osbl depth gaspar 1988 8a w e h b l t h b l t 0 8b w e 0 h b l t 0 in wmbls the tke 4 is assumed steady state and is integrated over the osbl following niiler and kraus 1977 9 0 h b l 0 z k m σ k k z d z h b l 0 u i w u i z d z h b l 0 w b d z h b l 0 ϵ d z the terms of eq 9 are parameterized to determine we following niiler and kraus 1977 gaspar 1988 the first rhs term tke flux convergence is parameterized as m 2 u 3 this proportionality assumes the surface tke flux is correlated to the friction velocity cubed u τ ρ 0 1 2 τ is the wind stress via a coefficient m 2 this surface tke flux could represent for example tke injection by breaking surface waves the second rhs term tke shear production is parameterized as m 3 u 3 the third rhs term buoyancy production is known for a uniform well mixed layer as 10 h b l 0 w b d z 1 2 h b l w e δ b 1 2 h b l b h b l where b hbl is the surface buoyancy flux considering interfacial and penetrative short wave fluxes both rhs terms in eq 10 can contribute to increased potential energy through turbulent mixing the first term increases potential energy when the osbl deepens we 0 the second rhs term accounts for potential energy change by turbulent mixing in the presence of stabilizing surface fluxes the final term in eq 9 is the dissipation one simple option to parameterize dissipation assumes that it is proportional to production via a convective proportionality coefficient 1 n and a mechanical proportionality coefficient md niiler and kraus 1977 gaspar 1988 11 h b l 0 ϵ d z m d u 3 h b l 2 1 n b h b l during stabilizing surface buoyancy flux n is unity and it becomes less than one during convection this study discusses the proper value in section 3 1 following the assumptions above the boundary layer tke balance is 12 1 2 h b l w e δ b m u 3 n h b l 2 b h b l where the sum of the mechanical m coefficients is defined as 13 m m 2 m 3 m d the first rhs term m u 3 in eq 12 represents the increase of water column potential energy by mechanically produced tke in the presence of a stabilizing surface flux this term must exceed the surface buoyancy flux term for we to be non zero the second rhs term in eq 12 contributes to we during destabilizing surface buoyancy fluxes when there is sufficient tke produced by the wind waves and convection to counter the tke destroyed by dissipation and mixing of surface stratification associated with a stabilizing surface flux then the boundary layer deepens when the tke production is no longer greater than dissipation the lhs of eq 12 is taken to be zero and the boundary layer depth retreats to the monin obhukov depth u 3 w b 0 the stabilizing rotational osbl depth limit of zilitinkevich and mironov 1996 indicates that the value of m should depend also on coriolis parameter f in this limit oberhuber 1993 indeed include additional vertical dissipation to m exponentially dependent on the ekman length exp z f u we investigate implications of rotation in wmbls in further detail in section 3 2 for discussion of traditional values of n and m see gaspar 1988 in prior generations of large scale ocean models the cheap computational cost of implementing eq 12 motivated use of wmbls e g oberhuber 1993 bleck 2002 thompson et al 2002 furthermore the total energy available for entrainment is prescribed from m and n and therefore is not sensitive to model time step and vertical resolution however there are well known limitations for climate models to assume that quantities are vertically uniform within the osbl for example the structure of the ekman spiral is important for restratification of the osbl along horizontal density gradients e g rodhe 1991 thomas and ferrari 2008 d asaro et al 2011 2 2 second order tke parameterizations in second order k parameterizations the mixing coefficients eqs 2 and 3 are predicted from dimensional reasoning as an analogue to the kinetic theory of gas 14a k m c μ k 1 2 l 14b k ϕ c μ k 1 2 l where cμ and c μ are stability functions the ratio of the two is the turbulent prandtl number pr and l is a turbulent length scale the tke eq 4 is solved numerically in second order parameterizations the dissipation term ϵ is dimensionally related to the length scale and the tke via kolmogorov 1942 15 ϵ c μ 0 3 k 3 2 l where c μ 0 is a model coefficient linking the turbulent length scale to the tke and the dissipation simplified one equation and two equation methods parameterize the stability functions from mean quantities the length scale is typically modeled using either a second prognostic equation such as in two equation models e g k ϵ rodi 1987

burchard 2005 the relationship between these coefficients determines the steady state richardson number of the parameterization which is critical for determining the entrainment rate in any second order model burchard and baumert 1995 the alternative prognostic length scale approaches have relatively similar forms c f rodi 1987 umlauf and burchard 2003 kantha 2004 and give consistent results if the empirical coefficients are adjusted accordingly rodi 1987 burchard et al 1998 burchard and bolding 2001 warner et al 2005 one equation approaches simplify the implementation to estimate the length scale from algebraic relationships in many scenarios one equation methods provide reasonable estimates for the turbulent mixing reffray et al 2015 an empirical approach to determine stability functions is to approximate them as functions of quantities such as the gradient richardson number rig this approach assumes relationships between the prandtl number and the richardson number schumann and gerz 1995 peters and baumert 2007 ilıcak et al 2008 2 3 a two equation closure for climate models by jackson et al 2008 the two equation k parameterization of jackson et al 2008 was developed for parameterizing mixing due to internal shear layers in the ocean such as in the equatorial under current or in deep ocean density overflows here we apply this parameterization for osbl wind driven shear turbulence while the equations of jhl formally include both convective and shear sources of tke it is only previously calibrated for parameterization of shear turbulence we therefore limit discussion of this parameterization to shear driven turbulence the jhl approach simplifies the two equation framework to facilitate fully implicit numerics for climate models the tke conservation equation is found from eq 4 with steady state and assumed dissipation functions 17 0 z k m σ k k z k m s 2 k ϕ n 2 k c n n c m s where cn and cm are empirical model dissipation coefficients the second

2 k s f we do not distinguish between kϕ and km here implying a prandtl number of unity though more general approaches apply umlauf 2009 discusses the physical implications of jhl in reference to more traditional second order methods the assumptions involved in using eqs 17 and 20 facilitate implementation of coupled cost effective iterative implicit numerical solvers for both the turbulent properties and their impacts on the momentum and density structure see jhl this fully implicit approach facilitates parameterizing shear driven turbulent mixing in models with time steps characteristic of climate simulations e g within mom6 climate model configurations adcroft et al in prep 2 4 considerations for global climate model time steps and vertical resolution in this section three energetically based osbl turbulent mixing parameterizations were discussed there are two aspects of such parameterizations that we consider for implementation in a global ocean model first is the ability of the parameterization to accurately simulate boundary layer physics second is the ability of the parameterization to work in computationally restricted numerical implementations including coarse vertical resolution and long time steps to evaluate the ability of the three parameterizations to work well with coarse vertical resolution and long time steps we investigate results from simulations of one dimensional column models with various time steps and resolutions see appendix b for details on the one dimensional model implementations to test the sensitivity to vertical resolution we vary the model grid thickness using values of 1 5 10 and 20 m with a constant time step of 10 s to test the sensitivity to time step we vary the model time step from 1 s to 7200 s with a constant grid thickness of 1 m we will examine the performance of the osbl parameterizations in both wind shear driven and buoyancy driven turbulence conditions for this exercise we use the k ϵ parameterization with the schumann and gerz 1995 stability functions as our two equation k parameterization hereafter k ϵ sg the k ϵ sg parameterization chosen here has previously been validated by observational studies peters and baumert 2007 ilıcak et al 2008 we also include results from a wmbl parameterization with constant m 1 2 and n 0 2 for the shear driven case we also include simulations using the jhl parameterization to evaluate the effect of resolution on the energetic constraint we investigate the change in integrated potential energy we initialize the model with a constant temperature gradient 0 01 c m 1 and homogenous salinity in each case the integrated temperature is consistent between all runs but the vertical distribution of this temperature changes the potential energy the change in potential energy is due to both the application of a surface heat flux and the entrainment mixing the surface flux contribution is unrelated to the turbulence parameterization and both are sensitive to the vertical resolution in all cases results are presented after 48 hours of simulation 2 4 1 one dimensional simulation of convective osbl first we investigate a case where the turbulent mixing is driven by convection via cooling of 100 w m 2 we find that both the wmbl and the k ϵ sg turbulence models give little sensitivity to time step and vertical resolution after 2 simulation days fig 1 the vertical resolution sensitivity is related to the coarseness of the first model layer where the surface cooling is applied evenly over 1 5 10 or 20 m depending on the resolution note that the non monotonic behavior with thickness is variable in time indicating the complex relationship between potential energy change due to surface cooling and entrainment 2 4 2 one dimensional simulation of wind driven osbl next we simulate a case with a strong surface wind forcing of 1 n m 2 in this case rotation effects are important for the boundary layer so we include both a case with no rotation equatorial and a case with maximum rotation north pole we find that with no rotation the k ϵ sg model gives significant sensitivity to long time steps missing all mixing at 7200 s fig 2 the jhl approach does not show this dependency likely because jhl is implemented in the model fully implicitly over the coupled turbulence and mean flow evolution whereas the k ϵ sg implementation solves the tke and ϵ implicitly dependent on the previous time step mean parameters at high latitudes both the jhl model and the k ϵ sg model are sensitive to the time step and the grid spacing the effect of rotation is not directly considered within any equations of the two equation osbl parameterization the effect of rotation on the column model is therefore entirely due to its effect on the evolution of the mean horizontal current profile this feeds back to the turbulence through the mean shear profile which will affect both the shear production term and the dissipation equation the sensitivity to grid spacing is therefore likely due to limited ability to resolve the temporal and spatial ekman spiral characteristics at coarse vertical resolution and long time steps this is exacerbated by the steady state equations used in jhl the sensitivity to time step in jhl and k ϵ sg is not entirely by the same cause the k ϵ sg sensitivity is likely related to the same time step effect that was found at the equator the jhl scheme was not sensitive to time step at the equator so it is likely only affected by time step due to coupling of turbulence with explicit numerics for coriolis acceleration the jhl model is formulated for coupled implicit turbulence and diffusion numerics so the time step dependence at high latitudes shows that significant error may still occur due to a rotating mean flow at long time steps in all cases reduced resolution and longer time steps both contribute to under estimated mixing except at 1200 s in k ϵ sg where the model appears to exhibit unstable behavior the bulk boundary layer has no dependence on vertical resolution or time step since the total mixing is only constrained by fixed constant external parameters m and u 2 4 3 implications of numerical sensitivity this numerical sensitivity experiment does not evaluate the performance of any parameterization to simulate accurate boundary layer physics the wmbl parameterization section 2 1 is not a useful approach for modern climate models because it does not resolve boundary layer structure and relies on poorly constrained global m and n coefficients these weaknesses can result in significant biases in prediction of the osbl evolution the shear driven mixing predicted by second order models is degraded by long time steps and coarse vertical model resolution a problematic weakness for ocean climate modeling the remainder of this manuscript therefore presents a framework motivated to combine the ideas of the wmbl and the k parameterization for an osbl parameterization capable of consistent turbulent mixing at long time step and coarse resolution for climate simulations 3 parameterizations for m and n based on k ϵ the potential energy change by turbulent mixing hereafter m is computed from the integral of the stabilizing buoyancy flux 21 m h b l h b l 0 k ϕ max n 2 0 d z the notation represents vertically integrated quantities the subscript denotes that the integral is over the osbl this quantity has mks units of m3 s 3 w m 2 m3 kg 1 which is the rate of potential energy density production per unit horizontal area in second order closures sections 2 2 this term is a component of the integral balance with the shear production convective production dissipation and tke storage by using 21 we express eq 9 of wmbls as 22 m h b l h b l 0 z k m σ k k z d z h b l 0 k m s 2 d z h b l 0 k ϕ min n 2 0 d z h b l 0 ϵ d z if we follow the wmbl assumption that dissipation is proportional to production via coefficients m and n section 2 1 the rhs of eq 22 becomes 23 m h b l m u 3 n h b l 0 k ϕ min n 2 0 d z the difference in eq 23 compared to eq 12 is that mixing occurs throughout the osbl instead of at the base of a homogeneous layer in this section we investigate precise values of m and n from this equation which are equivalent to the m and n integral constraints of wmbls 3 1 n in convectively forced osbls the freely convecting planetary boundary layer is well studied previously using observations of the atmospheric boundary layer and les models the atmospheric observations show that the entrainment buoyancy flux is about 20 of the destabilizing surface buoyancy flux e g carson 1973 caughey and palmer 1979 a les study for the ocean boundary layer also found this ratio is approximately 20 noh et al 2010 it is important to distinguish that n is not this ratio of the surface to the entrainment flux and not 20 but rather n is the ratio of the integrated positive to the integrated negative buoyancy flux within the osbl we use this empirical relation to estimate n in section 3 1 1 in the case of convection with no mechanical forcing eq 23 simplifies to 24 m h b l n h b l 0 k ϕ min n 2 0 d z this relationship may be employed to estimate n from models that solve complete tke balance equations to predict kϕ such as described by section 2 2 we use this approach to estimate n in section 3 1 2 3 1 1 n estimated from historical observations in this section we use the empirical entrainment result to estimate n fig 3 is a schematic representation from atmospheric convection observations based on caughey and palmer 1979 their figure 3 where we invert their figure for the ocean the buoyancy flux profile decays linearly from the surface value to the entrainment depth in fig 3 the value hg represents the level where the buoyancy gradient changes sign below this depth denser water is entrained as the boundary layer expands the observations show that the entraining buoyancy flux peak is approximately 20 of the surface forcing bf stull 1976 caughey and palmer 1979 we infer that the depth of this peak must be about 1 2 hg since the flux profile is approximately linear the areas of the triangles in this representation are the integrated buoyant production area ag and integrated mixing m h b l area a m 1 a m 2 if we compute the area of ag using the height hg and the surface flux w b 0 we find an expression for the buoyant production 25 a g 1 2 w b 0 h g we compute the area a m1 using 20 of the surface flux and 20 of the vertical extent 26 a m 1 1 2 0 2 w b 0 0 2 h g there is also entrainment below the entrainment flux peak as it decays toward zero at the osbl base this entrainment region is labeled a m2 in fig 3 we assume that a m2 0 and a m2 a m1 we can thus estimate n is 0 04 n 0 08 from 27 n m h b l a g a m 1 a m 2 a g 3 1 2 computing n from k ϵ we now estimate n from one dimensional simulations using k ϵ with schumann and gerz 1995 stability functions see appendix b for model details we simulate the one dimensional model with various destabilizing heat fluxes and find n from eq 24 is nearly constant fig 4 we estimate n 0 066 for the range of heat fluxes simulated here which is within the estimated range from the observations we compare our estimate for the n parameter directly to b 1 of stull 1976 through n 1 b 1 using the symbols from their study a 1 is between 10 and 30 and b 1 1 a 1 2 is between 0 91 and 0 99 therefore n inferred from their study is within the range 0 01 to 0 09 which is consistent with our estimate here due to uncertainty in the region a m2 and the choice of 20 for entrainment surface flux ratio we therefore use a constant value of n 0 066 to parameterize the contribution of convection to m h b l 3 2 m for wind forced and rotating osbl the coefficient m for mechanically driven mixing includes the interaction of several physical mechanisms related to wind driven mixing in one coefficient it will vary depending on factors including surface currents stratification and surface waves when surface wave effects and horizontal processes are neglected as we have for this study the mechanically driven turbulence is entirely due to instabilities associated with vertical shear in the eulerian mean wind driven current previous studies e g gaspar 1988 often employ a constant m parameter one study modifies this approach by introducing an exponential function with an e folding depth set by the ekman length oberhuber 1993 which introduces mixing dependence on u f and hbl we will test these approaches by investigating m diagnostically from one dimensional simulations using the more complete k ϵ sg parameterization in this section we investigate cases where the water column is initially stable and there is no destabilizing buoyancy force in this case eq 23 reduces to 28 m h b l m u 3 this equation is then used to compute m from the k ϵ sg simulations where m h b l is known we then infer relations to parameterize m to emulate k ϵ sg without sensitivity to the time step in this section we only explore rotating simulations we discuss non rotating simulations in section 3 5 3 2 1 no buoyancy forcing we first investigate the scenario of a pure wind forced rotating column using one dimensional model simulations with k ϵ sg the model is simulated with four initial stratifications θ z 0 04 0 02 0 01 0 001 c m 1 three wind forcings τx 0 1 0 5 1 n m 2 and four coriolis frequencies latitudes of 10 30 60 90 n to investigate variability of m the results are averaged over an inertial period to mitigate the effect of inertial oscillations the values of m for all simulations after 10 model days are shown in fig 5 the value of m correlates with hbl f u indicating reduced osbl entrainment as hbl approaches the ekman depth u f when the mean wind input of mechanical energy to the currents is equal to the tke production the mean flow is in steady state with the turbulence darker shaded circles in fig 5 if the model is simulated until this criteria is reached the m values converge approximately to the red line function 29 m n c n 1 1 1 c n 2 exp c n 3 h b l f u 1 where c n 1 275 c n 2 8 and c n 3 5 the robustness of this fit 29 to the model output was tested to h b l f u 0 1 though significantly longer duration simulations are required to reach this criteria not shown when hbl f u is less than about 0 3 the time required for the tke production to equilibrate with the wind input is often long multiple inertial periods which equals weeks at 10 latitude and months at 1 latitude in this case the balanced relation red line 29 for m is exceeded due to excitement of the currents beyond the ekman balance augmenting the shear production it takes several inertial periods for this enhanced energy to be extracted from the mean shear and the inertial oscillations such that the shear production balances the mean wind input this effect is prominent when the inertial period is long i e in lower latitudes and it exists even if the wind speed is imposed gradually over an inertial period we might construct an alternate fit to the simulation data which depends on the 10 day forcing time period of this experiment 30 m n b c n b 1 exp c n b 2 h b l f u where c n b 1 5 and c n b 2 3 in the blue line in fig 5 the fit of the data to this function is highly dependent on the duration of the simulation for a general application this approach is therefore not advisable this result confirms that transience and hysteresis are important in determining m particularly at lower latitudes 3 2 2 stabilizing buoyancy forcing we next investigate cases that include a stabilizing surface buoyancy flux in this case we introduce an additional external parameter bf we compute m from the k ϵ sg simulations for models with the identical four initial stratifications three wind speeds and four latitudes as in the previous section we also introduce four stabilizing heat fluxes 25 50 75 100 w m 2 we first show the value of m plotted against hbl f u fig 6 left panel the scaling for m is different from that found in the neutral case fig 5 the dashed red curve in fig 6 left panel is the curve found for the neutral m eq 29 this curve is the lower limit of m in this regime at a given hbl f u suggesting the effect of the stabilizing heat flux is to increase m from the neutral value and supporting the m n fit to h b l f u 0 15 we subtract the value of m n from the total m and plot the residual m s m m n against the non dimensional relation u 5 f b f 2 h b l the non dimensional relation u 5 f b f 2 h b l is the relevant non dimensional parameter combination using scaling arguments from the shear production equivalent to the obukhov length squared over the ekman depth times the boundary layer depth this relation correlates well with the model data and can therefore be used to parameterize m s fig 6 right panel this indicates that the fractional potential energy change due to turbulence mixing increases either when the obukhov length is reduced more stratification to mix or when the ekman depth or boundary layer depth are increased more energy available to mix in the stabilizing regime the computed m correlates well to the relationship 31 m s c s 1 b f 2 h b l u 5 f c s 2 b f 0 to parameterize m s in the presence of a stabilizing surface flux and rotation green dashed line in fig 6 where c s 1 0 2 and c s 2 0 4 this relationship 31 is applicable for a stabilizing surface buoyancy flux only the destabilizing flux is discussed in section 3 3 and m s 0 otherwise this fit is confirmed from simulations after roughly one inertial period spin up from rest and tested with heat fluxes from 0 to 1000 w m 2 at 1 90 latitude this fit is never valid at f 0 since the criteria for sustained forcing over multiple inertial cycles is not possible furthermore forcing time scales are not often equivalent to inertial time scales at near equatorial latitudes 3 3 coincident wind forcing with convection we now consider the case with both wind forced turbulence and convective turbulence if we employ n 0 066 and the m relationship from neutral forcing 30 we over estimate the total mixing in this scenario one reason for over estimating the mixing is straightforward when the wind generates currents the shear instabilities generate tke a fraction of this tke is dissipated and the remainder is available to mix stable stratification and create potential energy when there is a destabilizing surface buoyancy flux the mean stratification is unstable near the surface and therefore there is less stable stratification to mix the reduction of near surface stable stratification in the presence of convection means the fraction of wind driven tke converted to potential energy may be reduced relative to the neutral case the total tke and total mixing increases relative to the individual wind or convection alone cases but it is less than the sum of the individual processes this simple explanation does not consider the interaction between shear driven and convectively driven turbulent processes it also ignores tke flux away from the source region into the stable stratification below that mitigates this effect however this explanation may be used to approximate the effect of convection on mechanically driven mixing to demonstrate how significant the over estimated mixing is we compute m h b l over a range of both heating and cooling scenarios 100 to 100 w m 2 with a range of wind forcing and latitudes we compare m h b l predicted using n of 0 066 and m m n m s from eqs 29 and 31 in eq 23 to that computed directly from the k ϵ sg simulations for the cases with destabilizing heat fluxes the new formulation predicts more mixing than k ϵ sg fig 7 left we confirm that the primary cause is the overestimated mechanical mixing by setting n 0 in eq 23 in this case we neglect the contribution of convection but still predict a greater m h b l relative to k ϵ sg fig 7 right this result shows that even when the mechanically driven dominates it can be significantly reduced due to convection 3 4 parameterizing the reduction of m due to convection in this section we investigate the reduction of m due to convection we will examine the profile of the buoyancy flux after 10 days of simulation in both neutral and destabilizing wind forced k ϵ sg cases for a neutral case fig 8 black line we find a nearly linear profile in depth of the buoyancy flux to the mixing depth the value m h b l m u 3 is the area under this region if we approximate this area as triangular we can write m h b l 1 2 w h b l where w is width and hbl is height in which case 32 m h b l m u 3 1 2 h b l w the value of w here therefore equals 2 m u 3 h b l for a case with a convective surface flux fig 8 blue line we find that a fraction of the osbl has a positive destabilizing buoyancy flux in the region with positive buoyancy flux the turbulence drives potential energy release due to gravitational instability in this region no net tke conversion to potential energy occurs the vertical thickness of the region with negative w b is greatly reduced by the presence of surface cooling we use this knowledge to approximate the reduction of m proportionally to the fraction of the osbl thickness with unstable stratification we also note that the value of the buoyancy flux at the base of the osbl is only slightly increased due to the addition of convection e g width w the increase in this width will depend on the ratio of mechanical forcing to buoyancy forcing of osbl turbulence or the ratio of the obukhov depth and the boundary layer depth u 3 κ b f h b l we look at the effect of combined mechanical and buoyancy forcing more carefully in fig 9 the surface value of w b is by definition the negative of surface flux bf the value of w is hypothesized to remain approximately 2 m u 3 h b l ignoring additional contribution by the buoyancy flux to the entrainment flux if we know hbl the area of a in this diagram can be found without knowing hm or hg if the buoyancy is changing at a uniform rate in the boundary layer h g b f must equal h b l 2 m u 3 h b l b f where bf is negative in convection using these relationships the value of hg is written 33 h g b f h b l b f 2 m u 3 h b l from this expression we find the value of hm 34 h m h b l 2 m u 3 h b l b f 2 m u 3 h b l now to get a or equivalently m h b l we multiply 1 2 h m 2 m u 3 h b l 35 m h b l m u 3 2 m u 3 h b l b f 2 m u 3 h b l for this derivation we assumed that there was no additional downward flux of tke to mitigate the effect we discuss here one method to parameterize this reduction is to introduce a fractional positive constant to the buoyancy flux in the denominator 0 cψ 1 which serves to represent the impact of interactions with dissipation the ignored convective contribution to tke increase and other turbulent processes introducing this constant which we estimate to be 0 67 in the k ϵ sg simulations the quantity ψ h m h b l is written 36 ψ 2 m u 3 c ψ max 0 b f h b l 2 m u 3 this correction is then multiplied by m in the presence of a destabilizing surface buoyancy flux to approximate the reduction due to interaction of convective and wind driven processes in the simulations explored here this effect is important during even relatively weak destabilizing surface buoyancy fluxes to correctly predict m h b l we apply this correction to eliminate the over estimation of m h b l fig 10 the reduction of m does not imply reduced total tke relative to the isolated convection or wind forced case it is fundamentally similar but opposite to the enhancement of m found during a stabilizing buoyancy flux 3 5 non rotating cases in this section we presented relations that are used to parameterize variability in m for cases with f 0 we did not explore in detail the value of m when f 0 the behavior of the m coefficient is quite different between these two regimes at the equator skillful parameterization for m not shown correlates with hn 0 u where n 0 is the characteristic buoyancy frequency of the entrained water following pollard et al 1972 we deliberately do not investigate details of this scaling since there is no obvious transition between n 0 based scaling and f based scaling in the following section we present a method to infer mixing coefficient profiles from the wmbl method and the n and m values estimated in this section 4 a framework to predict turbulent mixing in climate simulations for climate simulations we propose that a useful parameterization is one that consistently simulates the energetics of turbulent mixing independent of time step and resolution we use the results of the previous sections to construct a vertical profile of the mixing coefficient that provides a numerically insensitive mixing parameterization the full mixing parameterizations will include contributions to the total osbl mixing coefficient from a new osbl parameterization hereafter the energetic planetary boundary layer or epbl with the resolved shear driven mixing parameterization of jhl we define the vertical profile of the vertical turbulent mixing coefficient for use in an ocean climate model as 37 k z f x k e p b l z k j h l z k n z where fx is a yet to be determined functional form kepbl is a mixing coefficient motivated by wmbls introduced in this section kjhl is the resolved shear driven mixing coefficient of jhl and kn represents mixing from arbitrary other sources the implementation of the jhl parameterization is not employed for convective conditions and is sensitive to resolution and time step when f 0 see section 2 the kepbl component of the parameterization therefore deliberately targets these two tasks for a climate model the kepbl component is a boundary layer mixing parameterization and is only intended to predict mixing in the osbl driven by the surface fluxes therefore the kjhl component and kn component are always required for turbulent mixing due to processes including internal shear driven mixing jhl and internal wave breaking we express the total mixing coefficient using an undefined function in eq 37 to emphasize that it is not generally sufficient to use a linear combination of mixing coefficients from separate energy sources when they occur together e g as shown in section 3 3 for convective and mechanical turbulence 4 1 the epbl mixing coefficient the epbl mixing coefficient is inspired by the wmbl approach and its insensitivity to long time steps and coarse vertical resolution here we will relax the assumption in wmbls of vertical homogeneity within the osbl motivated by hallberg 2003 the critical component of epbl is that the mixing coefficient and the depth of the boundary layer are explicitly constrained to satisfy the potential energy change due to turbulent mixing imposed using eq 23 we define the epbl mixing coefficient using the general form of 38 k e p b l z c k w t l where wt is a turbulent velocity scale and ck is a coefficient in kpp a non gradient mixing contribution is included to more accurately parameterize convection see large et al 1994 we neglect this component here as it does not significantly affect our results and its accurate parameterization in the ocean remains a topic of research e g van roekel et al 2018 epbl is designed to constrain the total potential energy change due to turbulent mixing and solve implicitly for the impacts of mixing on the density and velocity profiles without sensitivity to vertical resolution and time step the primary purpose of section 3 is to establish methods for parameterizing m and n to serve as the energetic constraint for vertical mixing in climate simulations in this subsection we present a method to estimate the vertical profile of the turbulent mixing coefficients kepbl the exact value of the mixing coefficient and therefore the values of wt and l in eq 38 are not critical for maintaining the integrated potential energy change constraint however the vertical profile of the mixing coefficient is important as it determines the vertical profile of the mean current and scalars near the surface 4 2 defining the turbulent length scale we begin by assuming the mixing length follows wall theory near the surface l z this approach is simplistic in the real ocean due to the presence of wave breaking and langmuir turbulence e g craig and banner 1994 sullivan et al 2007 the wave effects can be parameterized using a minimum roughness length z 0 if law of the wall is also a reasonable approximation for the mixing length at the lower boundary of the osbl we can use a length scale equation of 39 l z 0 z h b l z h b l this profile is expressed in a general way as 40 l z 0 z h b l z h b l γ where γ is the coefficient that determines the profile setting γ 2 gives a mixing length profile similar to that of kpp large et al 1994 k ϵ sg simulations simulations indicate that the value of γ is variable depending on factors such as latitude and buoyancy flux these details introduce only small errors in the context of this study and therefore are not investigated the mixing length does not typically become zero at the bottom of the osbl which may be either the ocean interior or the ocean bottom we therefore introduce a bottom length scale lb which can depend on bottom roughness or local stratification 41 l z 0 z max l b h b l h b l z h b l γ alternative approaches e g gaspar et al 1990 may also be employed to estimate the length scale we choose the form 41 since it is simple to implement in an ocean model and our results are consistent with the k ϵ sg approach see section 5 4 3 defining the turbulent velocity scale we do not predict the tke prognostically and therefore approximate the vertical tke profile to estimate wt an estimate for the mechanical contribution to the velocity scale follows the standard two equation approach in one and two equation second order k parameterizations the boundary condition for the tke is typically employed as a flux boundary condition 42 k k z z 0 c μ 0 u 3 the profile of k decays in the vertical from k c μ 0 2 3 u 2 toward the base of the osbl here we assume a similar relationship to estimate the mechanical contribution to the tke profile the value of wt due to mechanical sources v is estimated as v z 0 c μ 0 1 3 u at the surface since we only parameterize osbl turbulent mixing due to surface forcing the value of the velocity scale is assumed to decay moving away from the surface for simplicity we employ a linear decay in depth 43 v z c μ 0 1 3 u 1 a min 1 z h b l where 1 a 0 has the effect of making v z h b l 0 making the constant coefficient a close to one has the effect of reducing the mixing rate near the base of the boundary layer thus producing a more diffuse entrainment region making a close to zero has the effect of increasing the mixing at the base of the boundary layer producing a more step like entrainment region an estimate for the buoyancy contribution is found utilizing the convective velocity scale 44 w z c w z 0 w b d z 1 3 where c w is a non dimensional empirical coefficient convection in one and two equation closure causes a tke profile that peaks below the surface the quantity w b is solved for in epbl as kn 2 these choices for the convective and mechanical components of the velocity scale in the osbl are then added together to get an estimate for the total turbulent velocity scale 45 w t z w z v z this approach to diagnose a turbulent velocity scale is highly empirical and is therefore not expected to satisfy all general properties of turbulence theory in reality the two effects are not linearly summed however this approximation is reasonable to estimate of the velocity scale for this purpose the value of a in eq 43 is arbitrarily chosen to be 0 95 here we explored the use of alternative velocity scales such as kpp which extends similarity theory through the boundary layer and find little sensitivity over a wide range of realistic conditions future research efforts will investigate methods to improved the estimate of wt such as the effect of surface waves 4 4 summarizing the epbl implementation we now review the findings of this section and summarize the epbl framework we implement in our model the epbl mixing coefficient 38 is found by multiplying a velocity scale eq 45 by a length scale eq 41 the precise value of the coefficient ck in eq 38 does not significantly alter the prescribed potential energy change constraint a reasonable value is ck 0 55 to be consistent with other approaches e g umlauf et al 2005 the boundary layer thickness hbl within epbl is based on the depth where the energy requirement for turbulent mixing of density exceeds the available energy following eq 23 hbl is determined by the energetic constraint imposed using the values of n and m an iterative solver is required because m and the mixing length are dependent on hbl we use a constant value for convectively driven tke of n 0 066 the parameterizations for m are formulated specifically for the regimes where kjhl is sensitive to model numerics f δt 1 we find a neutral value for m given by eq 29 which is augmented under surface heating by eq 31 and reduced under convection by eq 36 4 5 combining the epbl and jhl mixing coefficients we now address the combination of the epbl mixing coefficient and the jhl mixing coefficient the function fx in eq 37 cannot be the linear sum of kepbl and kjhl one reason this sum is not valid is because the jhl mixing coefficient is determined by resolved current shear including that driven by the surface wind the wind driven current is also included in the epbl mixing coefficient formulation an alternative approach is therefore needed to avoid double counting kepbl is not used at the equator here as scalings are only investigated when f 0 the solution we employ is to use the maximum mixing coefficient of the two contributions 46 k z max k e p b l z k j h l z where m and hence kepbl is constrained to be small as f 0 this form uses the jhl mixing coefficient when the epbl coefficient is small eq 46 is a reasonable approach when the wind driven mixing dominates since both jhl and epbl give a similar solution when deployed optimally one weakness of this approach is the tropical region where the shear driven epbl m coefficient is not formulated the jhl parameterization is skillful to simulate this mixing but does not include the contribution of convection the convective portion of kepbl should be combined with kjhl in the equatorial region when shear and convection occur together though they are not linearly summed see fig 7 in this study we always employ the maximum value 46 since the mixing coefficient is consistent with the k ϵ sg approach despite this limitation section 5 future research will investigate more complete integration of the kepbl and kjhl energetics 5 evaluation of epbl against k ϵ we now evaluate epbl through comparison with a model using the k ϵ sg parameterization the k ϵ sg simulations are used to find m and n and determine the coefficients for epbl therefore inter comparison of free running simulations utilizing both k ϵ sg and epbl is a logical metric for evaluating epbl s capability to reproduce the k ϵ sg energetic constraint and test sensitivity to time step and vertical resolution the epbl parameterization is included in a one dimensional version of the mom6 ocean model adcroft et al 2018 here we show results where the mom6 model has been simulated with two set ups first we employ a 1 m constant vertical grid spacing and 1200 s time step the second set up tests coarse resolution used for climate models and employs a 10 m vertical grid spacing and a 7200 s time step the k ϵ experiments are run with a 1 m vertical grid spacing and a 10 s time step which ensures that the evolution of the turbulent quantities with the mean ocean state are accurately captured fig 2 for all simulations here the column is initialized with a constant stable stratification of 0 01 c m 1 we begin with a broad model inter comparison and then focus on several case studies for the broad comparison we vary the surface heat flux from 100 to 100 w m 2 in increments of 25 w m 2 to encompass a range from stabilizing to convecting we choose a moderate wind stress for this demonstration of 0 2 n m 2 u 10 10 m s 1 which allows for a range of relative strengths of mechanical and buoyancy forced turbulence to be tested this range of conditions is limited to relatively deep obukhov depths lo 25 l o u 3 κ b f in both stabilizing or destabilizing regimes in strongly destabilizing regimes the value of n for this parameterization is well constrained and the effect of mechanical mixing is minimal strongly stabilizing regimes in the realistic ocean heat fluxes 500 w m2 and wind speeds 5 m s are resistant to turbulent mixing below just a few meters and therefore are not included in this comparison we simulate the set up for latitudes ranging from the equator to 90 in 10 increments the average temperature over the top 10 m after 10 simulation days is compared from all 90 simulations to evaluate model performance we first show the resulting temperature change and the final osbl depth after 10 simulation days using the k ϵ sg model for all 90 simulations fig 11 there is significant variability in the osbl depth left panel over the simulations where rotation wind forcing and buoyancy fluxes all contribute in various regimes the temperature change right panel ranges from surface cooling of up to about 1 c to surface warming of a fraction of 1 c we simulate mom6 experiments with i jhl only no kepbl ii epbl only no kjhl and iii with the full set up employing the maximum turbulent mixing coefficient predicted from epbl and jhl eq 46 in the second and third case the convective turbulence is parameterized with a value of n 0 066 jhl is meant to parameterize mixing due to shear instability only 5 1 broad comparison k ϵ vs jhl epbl and jhl epbl we begin with a comparison using epbl and jhl at identical 1 m grid spacing to the k ϵ model the energetic constraints in epbl are not sensitive to the grid thickness but the simulation of cooling and heating in the model is therefore we first compare the similar model set up in these simulations the model with jhl performs well relative to the k ϵ sg simulations in the lower latitudes fig 12 upper left panel the jhl scheme does not perform well away from the equator particularly in the presence of surface heating one reason is that jhl performance is limited by the longer time step jhl w 1200 s and k ϵ sg with 10 s when the model is simulated with epbl alone we find the opposite result to using jhl fig 12 upper center panel the epbl scheme performs well away from the equator but has not been designed for the regime where f becomes small the surface temperature differences with epbl jhl are small relative to k ϵ sg for all cases simulated this result shows that the two parameterizations work in tandem to produce a good result fig 12 upper right panel we next show the simulations using a 10 m grid spacing and 7200 s time step in mom6 fig 12 bottom panels in this case the performance of jhl away from the equator is degraded left panels the epbl performance remains consistent with the previous experiment center panels the epbl jhl result remains reasonable compared to k ϵ sg showing that this framework is reasonable even at the coarse vertical grids and long time steps of ocean climate models 5 2 case study 1 convection we now present vertical profiles of the quantities simulated by the column models to demonstrate select results for the full column first we show a case with a surface wind stress of 0 2 n m 2 and surface buoyancy flux of 100 w m 2 cooling located at 40 n fig 13 for each scheme in mom6 epbl jhl epbl jhl we present the results using a 1200 s time step and 1 m vertical grid spacing dashed lines for the combined jhl epbl approach we also include a 7200 s time step and 10 m vertical grid spacing x s the jhl scheme is clearly inadequate for this case because it neglects convectively driven tke in this case epbl closely matches the mixing predicted by k ϵ sg the mixing coefficients near the base of the osbl are different which is primarily due to the k ϵ sg stability functions in k ϵ sg the turbulent diffusivity is computed from the turbulent viscosity through a prandtl number as a function of the richardson number in the other simulations the prandtl number is assumed one for simplicity the temperature and current profiles are not very sensitive to this difference showing the parameterization works as intended despite this simplification 5 3 case study 2 equatorial wind driven next we investigate the neutral no buoyancy force case with a wind stress of 0 2 n m 2 at the equator fig 14 the epbl parameterization by itself is inadequate at this location because the coriolis frequency tends towards zero and no parameterization has been provided for this regime the model with the epbl parameterization only blue therefore performs poorly the model with epbl and jhl green agrees with the jhl only model red showing that jhl sufficiently controls the mixing via 46 the jhl experiment performs well relative to k ϵ sg and shows little sensitivity to the tested time step differences 5 4 case study 3 mid latitude wind driven stabilizing buoyancy flux finally we show the simulation with a warming surface sensible heat flux of 100 w m 2 and a 0 2 n m 2 wind stress located at 40 n fig 15 here we find that the model with the jhl scheme alone is unable to predict the proper mixing coefficient due to the long time step we find that using epbl alone in the model compares closer to the k ϵ result using epbl in tandem with jhl is not significantly different from epbl alone supporting the maximum value approach of 46 the shape of the mixing coefficient is similar between the epbl formulations and k ϵ sg 6 discussion we introduce a framework for the osbl that emphasizes constraining the potential energy change by turbulent mixing for climate model applications the epbl component exploits relationships between this mixing constraint and external parameters we also employ an existing parameterization jhl that resolves shear driven mixing with limited sensitivity to model time step when the coriolis parameter is small the epbl method mitigates model sensitivity to time step and vertical resolution epbl therefore can supplement prognostic tke based parameterizations like jhl or k ϵ in climate simulations the new parameterization is demonstrated to simulate energetically consistent boundary layer mixing with time steps as long as 7200 s and grid spacing as coarse as 10 m we have not addressed several aspects that are relevant for general osbl modeling for example we deliberately exclude horizontal property gradients in this study processes related to horizontal gradients ocean fronts are important in the osbl and alternative schemes are required to include these effects in ocean models e g fox kemper et al 2011 bachman et al 2017 we review additional considerations that require investigation to improve model performance in this section 6 1 effects of surface waves in epbl wave breaking see craig and banner 1994 melville 1996 terray et al 1996 and langmuir turbulence see craik and leibovich 1976 skyllingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 belcher et al 2012 d asaro et al 2014 are important components of upper ocean turbulence and mixing breaking surface waves inject turbulent energy at the ocean surface with vertical dissipation scaling with the wave height see craig and banner 1994 terray et al 1996 melville 1996 langmuir turbulence which is due to interaction of wave driven stokes drift with background turbulence impacts osbl dynamics through counter rotating vortices with spatial scales of the osbl thickness these structures lead to enhanced vertical velocities and entrainment skyllingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 modifications to include langmuir turbulence in second order closure kantha and clayson 2004 harcourt 2013 2015 and kpp reichl et al 2016 li et al 2016 emphasize its importance for osbl parameterization on both weather and climate scales it is hypothesized that turbulence due to langmuir circulations interacts with turbulence due to wave breaking further enhancing mixing and entrainment noh et al 2004 sullivan et al 2007 mcwilliams et al 2012 recent studies demonstrate that wave enhanced osbl parameterizations improve ocean climate simulations particularly in high latitudes fan and griffies 2014 li et al 2016 the epbl framework will require modification to include the contribution of waves to osbl mixing for realistic climate implementation this can be done by introducing an additional stokes production term with properly calibrated dissipation in eq 23 this modification results in an additional m source related to the langmuir number the non dimensional relationship between stokes and shear production for brevity we reserve presentation of the surface wave effect within this framework for a separate study 6 2 transient forcing in epbl in tropical regions we found significant transient variability in m due to the long inertial period in extra tropical regions transient processes can produce inertial resonance contributing to enhanced turbulent entrainment see skyllingstad et al 2000 predicting m for this scenario would require a flow dependent parameter to be considered possibly using the wind energy input term this process could be incorporated within the epbl framework to improve performance for mesoscale ocean dynamics and finer submesoscale fronts and filaments the transient forcing scenario will require attention if this scheme is utilized in models with fine horizontal resolution 10 km the effect of the diurnal cycle is also important in near surface mixing and may require further modification to the epbl approach although it is currently in use in a coupled climate model with a diurnal cycle and provides reasonable performance adcroft et al in prep the transient events may average out in long simulations but due to hysteresis effects such as ocean heat uptake under storms e g bueti et al 2014 this scenario requires careful consideration for climate models at high storm resolving resolutions it is possible that the effects of transient forcing are too complex for the simple epbl framework in this case alternative methods to mitigate time step sensitivity to vertical mixing will be required one possibility is to introduce convection to jhl and to investigate methods to mitigate degraded performance in the presence of rotation 6 3 length and velocity scales in epbl the epbl mixing length scale is estimated from the distance between the surface and the osbl depth the velocity scale is estimated based on the buoyancy production and surface wind stress in the test scenarios explored here this approach provides reasonable vertical distribution of the mixing coefficients in the ocean the mixing length and velocity scale are dependent on characteristics of the turbulence including whether it is mechanically driven or buoyancy driven moeng and sullivan 1994 and the effect of surface waves craig and banner 1994 reichl et al 2016 the length scale and the velocity scale and the sensitivity of the resultant model to the mixing coefficients need to be explored further in realistic climate simulations 7 conclusion the energetic planetary boundary layer epbl framework is designed to provide the vertical mixing coefficient used to simulate the impact of ocean surface boundary layer osbl turbulence in ocean climate simulations computational restrictions in climate models dictate vertical resolution and time steps that are sub optimal for use of prognostic tke turbulence closure methods see fig 2 the time step sensitivity of tke closure is most notable in extra tropical regions where there is coupling between turbulence evolution and rotational effects on the mean state we develop an alternative parameterization for this regime which is combined with an equilibrium resolved shear parameterization jackson et al 2008 to provide global estimates of osbl mixing coefficients with little sensitivity to vertical resolution and time step the vertical profile of the mixing coefficient satisfies mixing constraints based on the increase in potential energy due to turbulent mixing two turbulent generation processes are included here shear production and buoyant production contributions due to other processes including surface waves are not included though are not precluded as an extension of this work the shear production is included by parameterizing the energy available for mixing from the osbl thickness the surface friction velocity the coriolis frequency and the surface buoyancy flux we have demonstrated that these factors provide an accurate parameterization for parameter m of the energy available for mixing in extra tropical regions see section 4 4 the convective contribution to the tke budget is estimated based on previous observational results and simulations using k ϵ sg we find that the n parameter the fraction of convectively released tke converted to potential energy is approximately constant with a value of 0 066 these values of m and n are used to determine the turbulent mixing coefficients

parameterize in epbl is the tke that contributes to buoyancy mixing conversion to potential energy third term from right for kϕn 2 0 in order to determine that this term is larger than the storage lhs in the tke budget we plot these two terms over the first 12 hours after forcing is applied for this experiment we conduct 6 simulations we vary the forcing to investigate weak shear driven 0 05 n m 2 strong shear driven 0 2 n m 2 and shear and buoyancy driven 0 05 n m 2 and 100 w m 2 cases we conduct each case with both equatorial and high latitude 60 coriolis parameters comparing the magnitude of the mixing component of the tke budget to the time storage term we see that the mixing term overtakes the storage term for all scenarios beginning at two hours of simulation the production and dissipation terms are not shown but are significantly larger than either term investigated here therefore we conclude that using a steady state tke budget in our model is likely to be reasonable as long as we are interested in processes with timescales longer than one to two hours 
24073,in this study a coupled ocean atmosphere model was used to simulate the evolution of typhoon nanmadol 2011 an intense typhoon that drifted over the kuroshio current over a 2 day period encountering land twice once in the philippines and once in taiwan sensitivity experiments were performed to elucidate the influence of the three dimensional ocean structure on predictions of typhoon intensity with a focus on the interaction between the typhoon and the kuroshio current in the luzon strait ls and the unique path of nanmadol the cooling of the sea surface which was associated with frontal movement in the ls significantly reduced the intensity of the typhoon the improved predictions of nanmodal s intensity resulting from this complex interaction between the ocean and atmosphere occur only in model runs which include full two way coupling between oceanic and atmospheric processes keywords typhoon luzon strait kuroshio coawst 1 introduction tropical cyclones tcs affect coastal communities in most of the world s oceans and cause drastic marine environmental changes improvements in predicting tcs and their interactions with ocean and atmospheric environments have aided emergency management and hazard mitigation however compared with methods for forecasting hurricane tracks which have been rapidly improved as a result of more accurate observations and effective numerical models improvements in tc intensity prediction methods have been gradual emanuel et al 2004 rogers et al 2006 demonstrated that over the course of 48 h track forecasting errors decreased by nearly 45 whereas strength forecasting errors decreased by only 17 from approximately 17 to 14 kt between 1990 and 2005 chen et al 2007 attributed this discrepancy to various deficiencies in numerical models such as coarse grid spacing low quality surface formulations and boundary layers and lack of coupling with an active dynamic ocean furthermore zambon et al 2014 indicated that coupling with a dynamic ocean is vital for accurate intensity forecasting this conclusion is consistent with that reached by yablonsky and ginis 2013 who from an observation based and theoretical perspective reported that the ocean ultimately serves as an energy source for tc intensification proper cooperation between oceanic and atmospheric components realized through coupled air sea models establishes potential for substantial improvements in the understanding of actual processes and interactions between upper ocean levels and the lower atmosphere under severe weather conditions and improved predictions of tc intensity yablonsky et al 2015 doyle et al 2014 in this study the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst modeling system was used to investigate air sea interactions in august 2011 during the passage of typhoon nanmadol near taiwan notably nanmadol drifted over the kuroshio current over 2 days providing a rare opportunity to further clarify the interactivity between the typhoon and the underlying kuroshio current the kuroshio current is the western boundary current of the north pacific ocean it flows northward transporting heat and salt to the mid latitude region to the north of luzon island the current encounters a boundary gap the luzon strait ls the ls is the only passage directly connecting the south china sea to the northwestern pacific ocean multiple flow patterns of the kuroshio in the ls which either penetrate or overcome the gap depending on the past flow state hysteresis have been verified sheremet and kuehl 2007 kuehl and sheremet 2009 moreover the location of the main stream of the kuroshio in the ls is crucial to the balance of the upper ocean heat salt and momentum budget of the northern south china sea the primary aim of the present study was to deepen our understanding of both kuroshio typhoon interactions in a gap in the western boundary as well as the implications of these interactions on typhoon development these topics were explored using the coawst modeling system 2 data and methodology 2 1 modeling system the coawst modeling system developed at woods hole coastal and marine science center in the united states is a synergy of three state of the art advanced modeling components designed to investigate dynamic processes of the atmosphere oceans waves and coastal environments warner et al 2010a b zambon et al 2014 the weather research and forecasting wrf model was used in combination with the advanced research wrf dynamical core skamarock et al 2005 the regional ocean modeling system roms and a nearshore wave simulation model to represent the atmosphere ocean environment and wave environment respectively these separate modules communicate through the model coupling toolkit a fully parallelized system that uses a message transmission interface to exchange model state variables warner et al 2008 detailed descriptions of the coawst system have been provided by warner et al 2010a b and zambon et al 2014 additionally zambon et al 2014 indicated that the inclusion of wave coupling is a topic requiring further research because of the inadequate treatment of the surface roughness length at the present stage thus for simplicity we only considered the effects from ocean and atmosphere coupling in this study and did not investigate the effects of wave coupling 2 2 experimental design typhoon nanmadol known in the philippines as typhoon mina was the strongest tc to hit the philippines in 2011 and the first storm of the year to directly affect taiwan over the course of 1 5 days 0000 utc august 27 1200 utc august 28 the typhoon drifted over the kuroshio between its two landfalls in the philippines and in taiwan this study focuses on the development of nanmadol and its interaction with the kuroshio prior to its second landfall in taiwan considering the unique moving track of nanmadol that enabled greater interaction between the typhoon and the kuroshio sensitivity experiments with different configurations table 1 of air sea coupling processes were conducted to elucidate the value of coupling ocean feedback the focus of this investigation was the interaction between the typhoon and the kuroshio at the effect on typhoon prediction in the first experiment exp wrf static sst a fixed sea surface temperature sst condition was retrieved at 0600 utc august 25 2011 from sst data provided by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep final fnl operational model global tropospheric analyses http rda ucar edu datasets this represents a case where the atmospheric model did not involve ocean feedback in response to typhoon nanmadol in the second experiment exp wrf updated sst the wrf model was executed with the sst input from ncep fnl data and updated every 6 h throughout the model run in other words a spatially and temporally smooth ocean state was considered the third experiment integrated a one dimensional ocean mixed layer oml model based on that established by pollard et al 1973 into the wrf model proposed by davis et al 2008 nanmadol passed through the major pathway between the western pacific ocean and the south china sea based on the evaluation results in a study conducted by chu et al 2004 the oml depth was set at a constant 50 m across the study area a temperature lapse rate γ 0 14 k m in oml deep water was selected exp wrf oml the fourth experiment exp coawst full coupled enabled coupling between the wrf model and roms with a 10 min coupling interval 2 3 domain and model configuration in all runs the same wrf physics the wsm6 microphysics scheme kain fritsch convective parameterization scheme new eta and ysu planetary boundary layer scheme and model domain fig 1 with 36 eta levels and an 8 km grid spacing were used notably an 8 km resolution model often still calls a convective scheme because it is incapable of resolving convective clouds olabarrieta et al 2012 all simulations were initialized with a model time of 0600 utc august 25 2011 initial conditions for the ocean model the coawst run fields of currents average depth of currents water level salinity and temperature as well as lateral boundary conditions for currents salinity and temperature were obtained from the global hybrid coordinate ocean model simulation http hycom coaps fsu edu thredds catalog html the grid space of the ocean model was 8 km with 36 sigma levels in the vertical initial and lateral boundary conditions for the wrf model were obtained from the global forecasting system gfs 1 data from the ncep fnl analyses http dss ucar edu datasets ds083 2 because of the coarse resolution of the data obtained from gfs analysis models initialized with these outputs frequently yielded typhoons with insufficient intensity a common problem in simulations of intense typhoon warner et al 2010a b zambon et al 2014 we next alleviated this systematic initial intensity deficiency as much as possible in all model runs while maintaining the unique moving track of nanmadol which was appropriately simulated in the experiments through the adoption of realistic conditions obtained from gfs data as the initial and boundary conditions this was done by using the rankine vortex model based on the best track data obtained from the japan meteorological agency jma to embed a synthetic tc in the wrf model after using the synthetic tc to initiate each run the first simulations were conducted on 25 august and the gap of intensity in the initialized field was greatly reduced the results are described in section 3 1 modeled tracks and sea level pressure were compared with the best track data from the jma the blended ssts of multiple satellites and in situ observations were used to compare the ssts produced through numerical simulations data from the global 1 km daily sst g1sst analysis were obtained from the group for high resolution sea surface temperature and multi scale ultra high resolution mur sst data were obtained from the nasa eosdis physical oceanography distributed active archive center po daac at the jet propulsion laboratory pasadena ca http dx doi org 10 5067 ghgmr 4fj01 3 model results 3 1 intensity and path of nanmadol fig 2 a compares the simulated tracks for all model runs and the best track data from the jma in each run the typhoon moved northwestward to the east of luzon and made landfall on the northeastern corner of luzon on 26 27 august 2011 subsequently the typhoons moved from the southern ls towards southwestern taiwan then passed through the taiwan strait and made landfall in china the differences in track errors between the experiments were quite small throughout the forecast 60 km in the ls the tracks produced using the coawst simulations were closer to the jma track than were those produced using the other simulations this result implied that different sst condition during typhoon ocean interactions which were due to the different data sources used to initialize the sst and differences in the ocean feedback process between experiments could alter not only the intensity but also the path of the storm the influence of the sst on the track might be caused by change in the intensity of the simulated typhoon nevertheless the track of nanmadol was mostly determined by large scale synoptic atmospheric circulation rather than by local processes notably the modeled translation speed of the typhoon was greater than the observation speed the deviation between the model result and the jma data with regard to the translation speed of the typhoon was most significant on august 25 26 2011 when the typhoon was to the east of luzon in the remaining simulation time the storm s translation speed was similar to that of the best track data overall regardless of the modeling complexity the simulated tracks were all similar to the observed tracks in comparison with relatively consistent moving tracks the simulated intensities of the typhoon under different configurations coupling complexity were more diverse fig 2b particularly when passing over the kuroshio in the ls according to the sea level pressure at the typhoon center exhibited in the jma best track data nanmadol s intensity increased until august 26 2011 later nanmadol made landfall on the northwest corner of luzon on august 27 2011 after which its intensity sharply decreased the sea level pressure at the typhoon center continued to increase during the period in which nanmadol moved across the ls before making landfall on southwestern taiwan of the experiments in our study the exp coawst yielded the closest result to the best track data of the jma in exp wrf static sst and exp wrf oml the intensity of the typhoon weakened much more slowly after august 27 than in the other runs resulting in an overestimation of the typhoon intensity in the wrf updated sst runs intensification occurred for a second time when the modeled tc was crossing the kuroshio region a finding that was absent in the jma data this reflected the scenario of a typhoon passing over the warm kuroshio by enabling ocean feedback to the typhoon itself through a prescribed sst in the wrf model this is an intuitive speculation with regard to the consequence of a tc passing over a warm feature e g lin et al 2003 however in the coawst run the typhoon continued weakening as it moved through the ls and did not undergo a second intensification which is consistent with the results of the best track data and implies that introducing the warm kuroshio as a lower boundary condition in the atmospheric model without instantaneous interactions between the atmosphere and upper ocean results in overestimation of tc intensification the second intensification was absent when a low resolution initial sst field was used and a relatively simple oceanic model was coupled with the atmospheric model case wrf oml however the intensity of the tc during its passage over the ls remained higher than was reported in the best track data thus the aforementioned results demonstrated the vital role of accurate and instantaneous representation of upper ocean dynamics 3 2 variations in sst and heat flux sst is the major pathway for ocean feedback to the atmosphere fig 3 presents comparisons of ssts before and during the nanmadol passage through the ls in each model run and in the g1sst sst data before the influence of the typhoon the distribution of the sst revealed that the warmest regions were in the northern south china sea and to the east of the ls between 12 n and 24 n with cooler water present off the eastern coast of china to the east of taiwan the sst was higher because of the transportation of advective heat by the kuroshio current the general pattern was consistent between the roms data from the coawst model run and the gfs fnl data input into the wrf updated sst model run whereas some mesoscale features present in the higher resolution data in the roms were absent in the coarser gfs fnl data the sst pattern revealed through g1sst corresponded more closely to the roms data in the coawst run than to the coarser gfs fnl data g1sst data fig 3e revealed the distinctiveness of the typhoon induced sea surface cooling the cool patch occurred along the storm track the gfs fnl indicated that the sst was higher during august 27 28 2011 than on august 25 2011 in the northern south china sea whereas the sst remained unchanged to the east of luzon the results of the coawst full coupled model run revealed a significant decrease in the sst of the ls that was larger than the decrease in sst to the east of luzon the strong sea surface cooling in the ls suppressed the intensification of the typhoon in the air sea coupled model as displayed in fig 2 the second intensification between august 27 and august 28 was absent in the coawst run therefore this cooling feature in the coawst run corrected the over intensification problem present in the other runs however the sea surface cooling in the ls revealed through g1sst was not as strong as that observed in the coawst run despite the slightly warmer initial sst in the wrf oml in comparison with the coupled runs the wrf oml run also indicated a distinct area in the ls in which the sst dropped however the sst cooling in the wrf oml run was only distributed in a narrow region which was confined to underneath the path of the storm because the oml model only considered the cooling of the sea surface as a consequence of the vertical mixing effect and assumed homogeneous ocean stratification the turbulent heat flux transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere is an essential energy source for typhoon development fig 4 displays the latent and sensible heat fluxes at 0600 utc august 27 2011 for each case when the typhoon was in the middle of the ls overall the latent heat flux was approximately two times higher than the sensible heat flux in the coupled run the latent heat flux in the ls region was approximately 300 500 w m2 whereas it was approximately 700 800 w m2 in the wrf updated sst and the wrf oml runs because of the noticeably lower ssts produced by the full dynamic ocean fig 3 in comparison with the other cases the simulated latent heat flux released into the atmosphere in the coupled case was significantly smaller than that in the wrf updated sst and wrf oml cases especially in the typhoon center because of the coupling effect overall the modeled results indicated that surface cooling in response to a typhoon played a key role in changes in typhoon intensity which was consistent with the results reported by black and holland 1995 monaldo et al 1997 schade and emanuel 1999 and glenn et al 2016 however the rapid decrease in the intensity of the typhoon when passing over a warm ocean feature was an unexpected phenomenon however one study reported the intensification of a tropical cyclone as it passed through the kuroshio to the northeast of taiwan wu et al 2008 in the following section descriptions are provided of detailed processes such as the effects of nanmadol on the kuroshio the influences of the kuroshio and feedback to the typhoon it was discovered that water from the south china sea provided the cooler water source for the upwelling and vertical mixing processes the movement of the frontal structure in the ls enhanced the negative feedback of the typhoon ocean interaction thereby contributing to the rapid drop in the strength of the typhoon 4 kuroshio and typhoon interactions in the ls 4 1 variations of the kuroshio main stream fig 5 displays variations in the kuroshio main stream at the sea surface layer depth of approximately 6 m during the passage of nanmadol the kuroshio main stream is defined as the zonal range with the maximum v component velocities in each running box fig 5 lower right before the influence of the typhoon on august 25 2011 the kuroshio main stream was directed northwestward across the ls before turning northeastward south of taiwan thereby forming a loop current in the ls the vorticity balance of the curved flow is primarily a result of advection and beta terms sheremet and kuehl 2007 kuehl and sheremet 2009 the speed of the kuroshio main stream ranged from 0 85 m s in the southern ls to 0 5 m s in the northern ls from august 26 27 2011 the ls was affected by strong northerly winds associated with the typhoon the kuroshio main stream in the southern strait shifted eastward and the flow speed strengthened as the typhoon moved northward along the kuroshio path this response of the kuroshio main stream gradually extended northward to the northern strait on august 29 2011 the speed and location of the kuroshio main stream returned to its initial state overall the typhoon contributed positive vorticity to the circulation in the ls and the positive vorticity on the west flank of the kuroshio main stream was intensified by the typhoon this process favors the kuroshio main stream flowing northward across the ls without significant intrusion into the northern south china sea 4 2 dynamic process associated with thermal responses to the typhoon fig 6 displays the temperature and horizontal velocity vectors that vary according to depth along a zonal transection across the middle of the ls during the passage of the typhoon on august 26 2011 a subsurface frontal feature was revealed by a broad temperature gradient 120 e 121 5 e accompanied by a northwestward flow in the upper ocean to the west of the ls the thermocline was shallower and stronger along the temperature front there is considerable current shear on the western flank 120 e 121 e of the kuroshio current at 0000 utc august 27 2011 when the typhoon was east of luzon the kuroshio front was undergoing the strong northeasterly wind during this time the translation speed of the typhoon was very low the upper ocean response to a nearly steady wind mainly followed the ekman balance e g gill 1982 hence the westward flow in the upper ocean was enhanced in the ls in the meantime the enhanced eastward flow occurred in the subsurface indicated by the white contours in fig 6 the wind forcing altered the momentum balance in the surface layers and caused the eastward transport of cooler water in the subsurface as a result of the pressure gradient force significant cooling occurred in the subsurface of the kuroshio 75 150 m region along the zonal transection the subsurface water in the south china sea provided a cooler source for the vertical mixing later when the typhoon had moved across the ls 1030 utc august 27 2011 the horizontal divergence in the kuroshio region caused by the combined effect of ekman transport and the restriction from the coastal geometry triggered an intense upward velocity in the lower layer the meridional current shear was strengthened and accompanied by the sharper zonal temperature gradient the significant cooling in the western ls resulted in an eastward shift in the kuroshio temperature front 1500 utc august 27 2011 consistent with the kuroshio main stream movement displayed in fig 5 eq 1 is the zonal momentum equation where kmv is the

and 7 is presented in fig 8 before the influence of the typhoon the flow was in geostrophic balance when the typhoon approached from the east of luzon island the easterly wind induced an anomalous westward flow in the surface layer as the diffusion term grew negatively in the meantime the diffusion term was counteracted by the coriolis term in the subsurface layer the flow anomaly was primarily in an eastward direction the opposite of that in the surface layer because of the pressure gradient anomaly later the strong wind changed to a southwesterly direction under the rear half of the typhoon and the diffusion term in the surface layer became in phase with the coriolis term resulting in the enhanced eastward flow in the subsurface layer the flow direction was the opposite of that in the surface layer during the period of northeasterly wind flow under the front half of the typhoon hence the inertial motion was out of phase with the flow in the surface layer the opposing direction of the flow anomaly resulted in a strong current shear hence the conversion of kinetic energy into turbulence was enhanced during the typhoon kuroshio interaction period to determine the process that led to the distinctive sea surface cooling before and during the passage of nanmadol the heat budget in the surface layer was investigated 2 t t tendency u t x v t y horizontal advection w t z vertical advection z k t z vertical mixing 0 we neglected the horizontal diffusion terms because they were several orders of magnitude smaller than the other terms fig 9 displays each term in eq 2 at varying depths in the middle of the ls 121 e 20 n the decrease in surface layer temperature began on august 26 2011 before the typhoon had entered the ls and continued until august 27 2011 when it reached its lowest value the typhoon passed through this region at approximately 0600 utc august 27 2011 during this period the variation in temperature in the upper region 50 m was a result of horizontal advection and vertical mixing whereas vertical advection dominated in the lower layer the vertical oscillation existed before the strong wind forcing which possibly resulted from local wind forcing or the advection of near inertial waves from the upstream kuroshio zhai et al 2004 vertical mixing contributed to cooling in the upper layer but warming in the thermocline region during the strong wind forcing period august 26 27 2011 resulting in a cooler and thicker mixed layer with a weaker vertical temperature gradient below the mixed layer the advective cooling in the subsurface layer 75 100 m was primarily due to zonal advection u adv in other words the westward flow in the surface layer and eastward flow in the subsurface layer in the kuroshio front region contributed to the cooling process subsequently during the wind forcing period the upwelling induced by strong negative wind curl caused significant cooling in the subsurface layer moreover the positive value of the horizontal advection term indicated that the warm upstream kuroshio water partially reduced the cooling that had been induced by upwelling the wind induced upward motion persisted for approximately 12 h meanwhile the upwelling induced cooling shifted upward over time because of the rising thermocline the diagnostic results presented in fig 9 revealed that approximately 35 of the sst cooling could be attributed to lateral advection and the remainder was primarily caused by vertical mixing the cool advection in the subsurface layer strengthens the vertical mixing in the frontal region because the mixed layer is much thinner in the scs and thicker in the kuroshio region notably the turbulent heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere is crucial for storm development whereas it is considered a negligible contribution to sst cooling price 1981 d asaro et al 2007 samson et al 2009 calculated that approximately 5 10 of mixed layer cooling is caused by surface heat flux in summary upper ocean cooling accompanied by the eastward movement of the kuroshio front that occurred before the typhoon moved into the ls resulted in a significant temperature drop when the center of the typhoon moved across this region 5 discussion and conclusions deficiencies in predicting tcs are often attributable to unrealistic ocean conditions in this study the sensitivity experiments demonstrated the significance of ocean feedback when a typhoon moves along an ocean front the model results revealed significant negative feedback to the typhoon in the ls as a consequence of the variation in sst a process associated with frontal movement in the ls during this period and under the front half of the typhoon the direction of wind driven flow in the surface layer was the opposite of the direction of pressure gradient flow in the subsurface layer the shear induced mixing and subsequent sst cooling was enhanced later under the rear half of the typhoon the in phase direction of the wind stress and the upper layer inertial motions further strengthened the vertical current shear the thermocline was shallower and with steeper vertical temperature gradients in the south china sea than in the northwestern pacific ocean providing a cool advective water source in the subsurface layer that could be mixed with surface water and uplifted during the strong negative wind stress curl the direction of the kuroshio main stream shifted eastward after the typhoon the more accurate prediction by the coawst model of the intensity of nanmadol indicated that a high resolution three dimensional 3d ocean model initialized with hycom sst reanalysis data can more effectively describe time space variations in the sst during the typhoon ocean interaction than can 6 hourly low resolution reanalysis data ncep fnl with a one dimensional 1d mixed layer model furthermore the large horizontal temperature gradient in the kuroshio front region made the assumption of the 1d mixed layer model more unrealistic in the case of nanmadol the sst feedback was different from that of other cases involving interactions between a western boundary current i e the gulf stream kuroshio and tropical storm wu et al 2008 nguyen and molinari 2012 because of the presence of a western boundary gap separating the south china sea water and the pacific ocean water in this region therefore the 3d process and high resolution model were particularly crucial for the prediction of nanmadol the thermocline is deeper in the upstream region east of luzon and downstream region east of taiwan of the kuroshio the ocean cooling contributed by horizontal advection was relatively weak the cool surface water was mostly behind the typhoon center thus the effect of the negative feedback on the intensity of the typhoon was restricted by contrast the negative feedback from the kuroshio in the ls to the typhoon was prominent this study demonstrated an exceptional interaction between a typhoon and the gap traversing western boundary current however the kuroshio in the ls exists in multiple steady states moreover the storm ocean coupling in the ls under various pre storm conditions and details regarding the influence of variations in the upper ocean thermal conditions of the typhoon structure require further investigation acknowledgements very insightful and constructive comments from three anonymous

24073,in this study a coupled ocean atmosphere model was used to simulate the evolution of typhoon nanmadol 2011 an intense typhoon that drifted over the kuroshio current over a 2 day period encountering land twice once in the philippines and once in taiwan sensitivity experiments were performed to elucidate the influence of the three dimensional ocean structure on predictions of typhoon intensity with a focus on the interaction between the typhoon and the kuroshio current in the luzon strait ls and the unique path of nanmadol the cooling of the sea surface which was associated with frontal movement in the ls significantly reduced the intensity of the typhoon the improved predictions of nanmodal s intensity resulting from this complex interaction between the ocean and atmosphere occur only in model runs which include full two way coupling between oceanic and atmospheric processes keywords typhoon luzon strait kuroshio coawst 1 introduction tropical cyclones tcs affect coastal communities in most of the world s oceans and cause drastic marine environmental changes improvements in predicting tcs and their interactions with ocean and atmospheric environments have aided emergency management and hazard mitigation however compared with methods for forecasting hurricane tracks which have been rapidly improved as a result of more accurate observations and effective numerical models improvements in tc intensity prediction methods have been gradual emanuel et al 2004 rogers et al 2006 demonstrated that over the course of 48 h track forecasting errors decreased by nearly 45 whereas strength forecasting errors decreased by only 17 from approximately 17 to 14 kt between 1990 and 2005 chen et al 2007 attributed this discrepancy to various deficiencies in numerical models such as coarse grid spacing low quality surface formulations and boundary layers and lack of coupling with an active dynamic ocean furthermore zambon et al 2014 indicated that coupling with a dynamic ocean is vital for accurate intensity forecasting this conclusion is consistent with that reached by yablonsky and ginis 2013 who from an observation based and theoretical perspective reported that the ocean ultimately serves as an energy source for tc intensification proper cooperation between oceanic and atmospheric components realized through coupled air sea models establishes potential for substantial improvements in the understanding of actual processes and interactions between upper ocean levels and the lower atmosphere under severe weather conditions and improved predictions of tc intensity yablonsky et al 2015 doyle et al 2014 in this study the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst modeling system was used to investigate air sea interactions in august 2011 during the passage of typhoon nanmadol near taiwan notably nanmadol drifted over the kuroshio current over 2 days providing a rare opportunity to further clarify the interactivity between the typhoon and the underlying kuroshio current the kuroshio current is the western boundary current of the north pacific ocean it flows northward transporting heat and salt to the mid latitude region to the north of luzon island the current encounters a boundary gap the luzon strait ls the ls is the only passage directly connecting the south china sea to the northwestern pacific ocean multiple flow patterns of the kuroshio in the ls which either penetrate or overcome the gap depending on the past flow state hysteresis have been verified sheremet and kuehl 2007 kuehl and sheremet 2009 moreover the location of the main stream of the kuroshio in the ls is crucial to the balance of the upper ocean heat salt and momentum budget of the northern south china sea the primary aim of the present study was to deepen our understanding of both kuroshio typhoon interactions in a gap in the western boundary as well as the implications of these interactions on typhoon development these topics were explored using the coawst modeling system 2 data and methodology 2 1 modeling system the coawst modeling system developed at woods hole coastal and marine science center in the united states is a synergy of three state of the art advanced modeling components designed to investigate dynamic processes of the atmosphere oceans waves and coastal environments warner et al 2010a b zambon et al 2014 the weather research and forecasting wrf model was used in combination with the advanced research wrf dynamical core skamarock et al 2005 the regional ocean modeling system roms and a nearshore wave simulation model to represent the atmosphere ocean environment and wave environment respectively these separate modules communicate through the model coupling toolkit a fully parallelized system that uses a message transmission interface to exchange model state variables warner et al 2008 detailed descriptions of the coawst system have been provided by warner et al 2010a b and zambon et al 2014 additionally zambon et al 2014 indicated that the inclusion of wave coupling is a topic requiring further research because of the inadequate treatment of the surface roughness length at the present stage thus for simplicity we only considered the effects from ocean and atmosphere coupling in this study and did not investigate the effects of wave coupling 2 2 experimental design typhoon nanmadol known in the philippines as typhoon mina was the strongest tc to hit the philippines in 2011 and the first storm of the year to directly affect taiwan over the course of 1 5 days 0000 utc august 27 1200 utc august 28 the typhoon drifted over the kuroshio between its two landfalls in the philippines and in taiwan this study focuses on the development of nanmadol and its interaction with the kuroshio prior to its second landfall in taiwan considering the unique moving track of nanmadol that enabled greater interaction between the typhoon and the kuroshio sensitivity experiments with different configurations table 1 of air sea coupling processes were conducted to elucidate the value of coupling ocean feedback the focus of this investigation was the interaction between the typhoon and the kuroshio at the effect on typhoon prediction in the first experiment exp wrf static sst a fixed sea surface temperature sst condition was retrieved at 0600 utc august 25 2011 from sst data provided by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep final fnl operational model global tropospheric analyses http rda ucar edu datasets this represents a case where the atmospheric model did not involve ocean feedback in response to typhoon nanmadol in the second experiment exp wrf updated sst the wrf model was executed with the sst input from ncep fnl data and updated every 6 h throughout the model run in other words a spatially and temporally smooth ocean state was considered the third experiment integrated a one dimensional ocean mixed layer oml model based on that established by pollard et al 1973 into the wrf model proposed by davis et al 2008 nanmadol passed through the major pathway between the western pacific ocean and the south china sea based on the evaluation results in a study conducted by chu et al 2004 the oml depth was set at a constant 50 m across the study area a temperature lapse rate γ 0 14 k m in oml deep water was selected exp wrf oml

wsm6 microphysics scheme kain fritsch convective parameterization scheme new eta and ysu planetary boundary layer scheme and model domain fig 1 with 36 eta levels and an 8 km grid spacing were used notably an 8 km resolution model often still calls a convective scheme because it is incapable of resolving convective clouds olabarrieta et al 2012 all simulations were initialized with a model time of 0600 utc august 25 2011 initial conditions for the ocean model the coawst run fields of currents average depth of currents water level salinity and temperature as well as lateral boundary conditions for currents salinity and temperature were obtained from the global hybrid coordinate ocean model simulation http hycom coaps fsu edu thredds catalog html the grid space of the ocean model was 8 km with 36 sigma levels in the vertical initial and lateral boundary conditions for the wrf model were obtained from the global forecasting system gfs 1 data from the ncep fnl analyses http dss ucar edu datasets ds083 2 because of the coarse resolution of the data obtained from gfs analysis models initialized with these outputs frequently yielded typhoons with insufficient intensity a common problem in simulations of intense typhoon warner et al 2010a b zambon et al 2014 we next alleviated this systematic initial intensity deficiency as much as possible in all model runs while maintaining the unique moving track of nanmadol which was appropriately simulated in the experiments through the adoption of realistic conditions obtained from gfs data as the initial and boundary conditions this was done by using the rankine vortex model based on the best track data obtained from the japan meteorological agency jma to embed a synthetic tc in the wrf model after using the synthetic tc to initiate each run the first simulations were conducted on 25 august and the gap of intensity in the initialized field was greatly reduced the results are described in section 3 1 modeled tracks and sea level pressure were compared with the best track data from the jma the blended ssts of multiple satellites and in situ observations were used to compare the ssts produced through numerical simulations data from the global 1 km daily sst g1sst analysis were obtained from the group for high resolution sea surface temperature and multi scale ultra high resolution mur sst data were obtained from the nasa eosdis physical oceanography distributed active archive center po daac at the jet propulsion laboratory pasadena ca http dx doi org 10 5067 ghgmr 4fj01 3 model results 3 1 intensity and path of nanmadol fig 2 a compares the simulated tracks for all model runs and the best track data from the jma in each run the typhoon moved northwestward to the east of luzon and made landfall on the northeastern corner of luzon on 26 27 august 2011 subsequently the typhoons moved from the southern ls towards southwestern taiwan then passed through the taiwan strait and made landfall in china the differences in track errors between the experiments were quite small throughout the forecast 60 km in the ls the tracks produced using the coawst simulations were closer to the jma track than were those produced using the other simulations this result implied that different sst condition during typhoon ocean interactions which were due to the different data sources used to initialize the sst and differences in the ocean feedback process between experiments could alter not only the intensity but also the path of the storm the influence of the sst on the track might be caused by change in the intensity of the simulated typhoon nevertheless the track of nanmadol was mostly determined by large scale synoptic atmospheric circulation rather than by local processes notably the modeled translation speed of the typhoon was greater than the observation speed the deviation between the model result and the jma data with regard to the translation speed of the typhoon was most significant on august 25 26 2011 when the typhoon was to the east of luzon in the remaining simulation time the storm s translation speed was similar to that of the best track data overall regardless of the modeling complexity the simulated tracks were all similar to the observed tracks in comparison with relatively consistent moving tracks the simulated intensities of the typhoon under different configurations coupling complexity were more diverse fig 2b particularly when passing over the kuroshio in the ls according to the sea level pressure at the typhoon center exhibited in the jma best track data nanmadol s intensity increased until august 26 2011 later nanmadol made landfall on the northwest corner of luzon on august 27 2011 after which its intensity sharply decreased the sea level pressure at the typhoon center continued to increase during the period in which nanmadol moved across the ls before making landfall on southwestern taiwan of the experiments in our study the exp coawst yielded the closest result to the best track data of the jma in exp wrf static sst and exp wrf oml the intensity of the typhoon weakened much more slowly after august 27 than in the other runs resulting in an overestimation of the typhoon intensity in the wrf updated sst runs intensification occurred for a second time when the modeled tc was crossing the kuroshio region a finding that was absent in the jma data this reflected the scenario of a typhoon passing over the warm kuroshio by enabling ocean feedback to the typhoon itself through a prescribed sst in the wrf model this is an intuitive speculation with regard to the consequence of a tc passing over a warm feature e g lin et al 2003 however in the coawst run the typhoon continued weakening as it moved through the ls and did not undergo a second intensification which is consistent with the results of the best track data and implies that introducing the warm kuroshio as a lower boundary condition in the atmospheric model without instantaneous interactions between the atmosphere and upper ocean results in overestimation of tc intensification the second intensification was absent when a low resolution initial sst field was used and a relatively simple oceanic model was coupled with the atmospheric model case wrf oml however the intensity of the tc during its passage over the ls remained higher than was reported in the best track data thus the aforementioned results demonstrated the vital role of accurate and instantaneous representation of upper ocean dynamics 3 2 variations in sst and heat flux sst is the major pathway for ocean feedback to the atmosphere fig 3 presents comparisons of ssts before and during the nanmadol passage through the ls in each model run and in the g1sst sst data before the influence of the typhoon the distribution of the sst revealed that the warmest regions were in the northern south china sea and to the east of the ls between 12 n and 24 n with cooler water present off the eastern coast of china to the east of taiwan the sst was higher because of the transportation of advective heat by the kuroshio current the general pattern was consistent between the roms data from the coawst model run and the gfs fnl data input into the wrf updated sst model run whereas some mesoscale features present in the higher resolution data in the roms were absent in the coarser gfs fnl data the sst pattern revealed through g1sst corresponded more closely to the roms data in the coawst run than to the coarser gfs fnl data g1sst data fig 3e revealed the distinctiveness of the typhoon induced sea surface cooling the cool patch occurred along the storm track the gfs fnl indicated that the sst was higher during august 27 28 2011 than on august 25 2011 in the northern south china sea whereas the sst remained unchanged to the east of luzon the results of the coawst full coupled model run revealed a significant decrease in the sst of the ls that was larger than the decrease in sst to the east of luzon the strong sea surface cooling in the ls suppressed the intensification of the typhoon in the air sea coupled model as displayed in fig 2 the second intensification between august 27 and august 28 was absent in the coawst run therefore this cooling feature in the coawst run corrected the over intensification problem present in the other runs however the sea surface cooling in the ls revealed through g1sst was not as strong as that observed in the coawst run despite the slightly warmer initial sst in the wrf oml in comparison with the coupled runs the wrf oml run also indicated a distinct area in the ls in which the sst dropped however the sst cooling in the wrf oml run was only distributed in a narrow region which was confined to underneath the path of the storm because the oml model only considered the cooling of the sea surface as a consequence of the vertical mixing effect and assumed homogeneous ocean stratification the turbulent heat flux transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere is an essential energy source for typhoon development fig 4 displays the latent and sensible heat fluxes at 0600 utc august 27 2011 for each case when the typhoon was in the middle of the ls overall the latent heat flux was approximately two times higher than the sensible heat flux in the coupled run the latent heat flux in the ls region was approximately 300 500 w m2 whereas it was approximately 700 800 w m2 in the wrf updated sst and the wrf oml runs because of the noticeably lower ssts produced by the full dynamic ocean fig 3 in comparison with the other cases the simulated latent heat flux released into the atmosphere in the coupled case was significantly smaller than that in the wrf updated sst and wrf oml cases especially in the typhoon center because of the coupling effect overall the modeled results indicated that surface cooling in response to a typhoon played a key role in changes in typhoon intensity which was consistent with the results reported by black and holland 1995 monaldo et al 1997 schade and emanuel 1999 and glenn et al 2016 however the rapid decrease in the intensity of the typhoon when passing over a warm ocean feature was an unexpected phenomenon however one study reported the intensification of a tropical cyclone as it passed through the kuroshio to the northeast of taiwan wu et al 2008 in the following section descriptions are provided of detailed processes such as the effects of nanmadol on the kuroshio the influences of the kuroshio and feedback to the typhoon it was discovered that water from the south china sea provided the cooler water source for the upwelling and vertical mixing processes the movement of the frontal structure in the ls enhanced the negative feedback of the typhoon ocean interaction thereby contributing to the rapid drop in the strength of the typhoon 4 kuroshio and typhoon interactions in the ls 4 1 variations of the kuroshio main stream fig 5 displays variations in the kuroshio main stream at the sea surface layer depth of approximately 6 m during the passage of nanmadol the kuroshio main stream is defined as the zonal range with the maximum v component velocities in each running box fig 5 lower right before the influence of the typhoon on august 25 2011 the kuroshio main stream was directed northwestward across the ls before turning northeastward south of taiwan thereby forming a loop current in the ls the vorticity balance of the curved flow is primarily a result of advection and beta terms sheremet and kuehl 2007 kuehl and sheremet 2009 the speed of the kuroshio main stream ranged from 0 85 m s in the southern ls to 0 5 m s in the northern ls from august 26 27 2011 the ls was affected by strong northerly winds associated with the typhoon the kuroshio main stream in the southern strait shifted eastward and the flow speed strengthened as the typhoon moved northward along the kuroshio path this response of the kuroshio main stream gradually extended northward to the northern strait on august 29 2011 the speed and location of the kuroshio main stream returned to its initial state overall the typhoon contributed positive vorticity to the circulation in the ls and the positive vorticity on the west flank of the kuroshio main stream was intensified by the typhoon this process favors the kuroshio main stream flowing northward across the ls without significant intrusion into the northern south china sea 4 2 dynamic process associated with thermal responses to the typhoon fig 6 displays the temperature and horizontal velocity vectors that vary according to depth along a zonal transection across the middle of the ls during the passage of the typhoon on august 26 2011 a subsurface frontal feature was revealed by a broad temperature gradient 120 e 121 5 e accompanied by a northwestward flow in the upper ocean to the west of the ls the thermocline was shallower and stronger along the temperature front there is considerable current shear on the western flank 120 e 121 e of the kuroshio current at 0000 utc august 27 2011 when the typhoon was east of luzon the kuroshio front was undergoing the strong northeasterly wind during this time the translation speed of the typhoon was very low the upper ocean response to a nearly steady wind mainly followed the ekman balance e g gill 1982 hence the westward flow in the upper ocean was enhanced in the ls in the meantime the enhanced eastward flow occurred in the subsurface indicated by the white contours in fig 6 the wind forcing altered the momentum balance in the surface layers and caused the eastward transport of cooler water in the subsurface as a result of the pressure gradient force significant cooling occurred in the subsurface of the kuroshio 75 150 m region along the zonal transection the subsurface water in the south china sea provided a cooler source for the vertical mixing later when the typhoon had moved across the ls 1030 utc august 27 2011 the horizontal divergence in the kuroshio region caused by the combined effect of ekman transport and the restriction from the coastal geometry triggered an intense upward velocity in the lower layer the meridional current shear was strengthened and accompanied by the sharper zonal temperature gradient the significant cooling in the western ls resulted in an eastward shift in the kuroshio temperature front 1500 utc august 27 2011 consistent with the kuroshio main stream movement displayed in fig 5 eq 1 is the zonal momentum equation where kmv is the

and 7 is presented in fig 8 before the influence of the typhoon the flow was in geostrophic balance when the typhoon approached from the east of luzon island the easterly wind induced an anomalous westward flow in the surface layer as the diffusion term grew negatively in the meantime the diffusion term was counteracted by the coriolis term in the subsurface layer the flow anomaly was primarily in an eastward direction the opposite of that in the surface layer because of the pressure gradient anomaly later the strong wind changed to a southwesterly direction under the rear half of the typhoon and the diffusion term in the surface layer became in phase with the coriolis term resulting in the enhanced eastward flow in the subsurface layer the flow direction was the opposite of that in the surface layer during the period of northeasterly wind flow under the front half of the typhoon hence the inertial motion was out of phase with the flow in the surface layer the opposing direction of the flow anomaly resulted in a strong current shear hence the conversion of kinetic energy into turbulence was enhanced during the typhoon kuroshio interaction period to determine the process that led to the distinctive sea surface cooling before and during the passage of nanmadol the heat budget in the surface layer was investigated 2 t t tendency u t x v t y horizontal advection

2 at varying depths in the middle of the ls 121 e 20 n the decrease in surface layer temperature began on august 26 2011 before the typhoon had entered the ls and continued until august 27 2011 when it reached its lowest value the typhoon passed through this region at approximately 0600 utc august 27 2011 during this period the variation in temperature in the upper region 50 m was a result of horizontal advection and vertical mixing whereas vertical advection dominated in the lower layer the vertical oscillation existed before the strong wind forcing which possibly resulted from local wind forcing or the advection of near inertial waves from the upstream kuroshio zhai et al 2004 vertical mixing contributed to cooling in the upper layer but warming in the thermocline region during the strong wind forcing period august 26 27 2011 resulting in a cooler and thicker mixed layer with a weaker vertical temperature gradient below the mixed layer the advective cooling in the subsurface layer 75 100 m was primarily due to zonal advection u adv in other words the westward flow in the surface layer and eastward flow in the subsurface layer in the kuroshio front region contributed to the cooling process subsequently during the wind forcing period the upwelling induced by strong negative wind curl caused significant cooling in the subsurface layer moreover the positive value of the horizontal advection term indicated that the warm upstream kuroshio water partially reduced the cooling that had been induced by upwelling the wind induced upward motion persisted for approximately 12 h meanwhile the upwelling induced cooling shifted upward over time because of the rising thermocline the diagnostic results presented in fig 9 revealed that approximately 35 of the sst cooling could be attributed to lateral advection and the remainder was primarily caused by vertical mixing the cool advection in the subsurface layer strengthens the vertical mixing in the frontal region because the mixed layer is much thinner in the scs and thicker in the kuroshio region notably the turbulent heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere is crucial for storm development whereas it is considered a negligible contribution to sst cooling price 1981 d asaro et al 2007 samson et al 2009 calculated that approximately 5 10 of mixed layer cooling is caused by surface heat flux in summary upper ocean cooling accompanied by the eastward movement of the kuroshio front that occurred before the typhoon moved into the ls resulted in a significant temperature drop when the center of the typhoon moved across this region 5 discussion and conclusions deficiencies in predicting tcs are often attributable to unrealistic ocean conditions in this study the sensitivity experiments demonstrated the significance of ocean feedback when a typhoon moves along an ocean front the model results revealed significant negative feedback to the typhoon in the ls as a consequence of the variation in sst a process associated with frontal movement in the ls during this period and under the front half of the typhoon the direction of wind driven flow in the surface layer was the opposite of the direction of pressure gradient flow in the subsurface layer the shear induced mixing and subsequent sst cooling was enhanced later under the rear half of the typhoon the in phase direction of the wind stress and the upper layer inertial motions further strengthened the vertical current shear the thermocline was shallower and with steeper vertical temperature gradients in the south china sea than in the northwestern pacific ocean providing a cool advective water source in the subsurface layer that could be mixed with surface water and uplifted during the strong negative wind stress curl the direction of the kuroshio main stream shifted eastward after the typhoon the more accurate prediction by the coawst model of the intensity of nanmadol indicated that a high resolution three dimensional 3d ocean model initialized with hycom sst reanalysis data can more effectively describe time space variations in the sst during the typhoon ocean interaction than can 6 hourly low resolution reanalysis data ncep fnl with a one dimensional 1d mixed layer model furthermore the large horizontal temperature gradient in the kuroshio front region made the assumption of the 1d mixed layer model more unrealistic in the case of nanmadol the sst feedback was different from that of other cases involving interactions between a western boundary current i e the gulf stream kuroshio and tropical storm wu et al 2008 nguyen and molinari 2012 because of the presence of a western boundary gap separating the south china sea water and the pacific ocean water in this region therefore the 3d process and high resolution model were particularly crucial for the prediction of nanmadol the thermocline is deeper in the upstream region east of luzon and downstream region east of taiwan of the kuroshio the ocean cooling contributed by horizontal advection was relatively weak the cool surface water was mostly behind the typhoon center thus the effect of the negative feedback on the intensity of the typhoon was restricted by contrast the negative feedback from the kuroshio in the ls to the typhoon was prominent this study demonstrated an exceptional interaction between a typhoon and the gap traversing western boundary current however the kuroshio in the ls exists in multiple steady states moreover the storm ocean coupling in the ls under various pre storm conditions and details regarding the influence of variations in the upper ocean thermal conditions of the typhoon structure require further investigation acknowledgements very insightful and constructive comments from three anonymous

24074,a complex archipelago exhibits high velocity shear strong advection and significant nonlinearity for tides overtides tidal currents and subtidal hydrodynamics here a high resolution regional ocean modeling system with two way nesting is applied to the coastal zhoushan archipelago in the east china sea after validation for the m2 s2 k1 and o1 tidal constituents the spatial structures of tides and tidal currents are presented the features of these constituents and two significant overtides of m2 m4 and m6 are discussed the m2 tide is dominant in the study domain followed by the s2 k1 and o1 tides in amplitude in that order tidal energy budget analysis shows that about 46 4 of the incoming energy is dissipated inside the study area and 67 3 of the dissipated energy is consumed by the bottom friction while the remainder passes through the study domain jetlike flows in the channels are among the most remarkable features analysis of momentum balance terms averaged over the flood or ebb period demonstrates that the primary balance near the islands is between the horizontal advection and the pressure gradient force suggesting a predominant bernoulli type motion with strong nonlinearity however in the area away from the islands the horizontal advection becomes less important the m4 and m6 tides are mainly generated by nonlinear advection bottom friction plays a minor role and the interactions between different constituents also have some influence keywords zhoushan archipelago tidal dynamics overtides numerical model jet through islands 1 introduction an archipelago with complicated coastlines numerous islands narrow channels and rugged bottom topography is one of most complex geographies in the ocean the complicated topography tides and tidal currents in an archipelago present a complex dynamic system which has attracted considerable interest for decades hatayama et al 1996 investigated the characteristics of tides and tidal currents in the indonesian archipelago in the java sea and found relatively strong tidal currents in the vicinities of narrow straits e g the lombok strait and malacca strait hannah et al 2009 simulated tidal currents in the canadian arctic archipelago and reported that large velocity is generally found in narrow channels and shallow areas choo and kim 2013 demonstrated that rapid depth changes and narrow channels play important roles in the tidal dynamics in an archipelago using a relatively high resolution 1 km numerical model chen et al 2009 studied the complex tidal structure and energy flux along the coast particularly in the narrow straits of the canadian arctic archipelago and highlighted that horizontal resolution and geometric fitting are two prerequisites to realistically model the tidal dynamics in such a complex topographic region numerical studies with high spatial resolution are essential to resolve numerous islands and channels for reliable quantification of exchange flows with the shelf in an attempt to develop a regional ocean prediction model for the philippine archipelago arango et al 2011 stressed that finer resolution e g 2 km is needed to resolve the interisland passages the zhoushan archipelago consists of 1390 islands and 3306 reefs near the western edge of the east china sea and the southeastern end of hangzhou bay fig 1 it covers about 20 800 km2 of water and 1440 12 km2 of land the zhoushan archipelago is a pivotal marine gateway of east china to the world the government approved the establishment of the zhoushan archipelago new district in july 2011 and announced zhoushan as one of the seven free trade areas in august 2016 with these developments a variety of human activities such as reclamation port terminal construction and waterway regulation will significantly influence the marine environment of the zhoushan archipelago which used to be pristine remote vegetated islands and ocean abundant in fish for example sewage discharged into the sea will deteriorate the water quality the reclamation may strongly impact the tidal dynamics in areas of construction which can potentially induce seabed erosion or deposition in addition the zhoushan archipelago is ideal for harvesting tidal energy to generate electricity hou et al 2015 the water depth in this area varies greatly fig 1c it is about 30 m in the nearshore region while many narrow channels between islands are much deeper e g up to 130 m in the jintang channel with large gradients this kind of topography is conducive to the formation of strong currents convergence of tidal current and convenient use of tidal energy hou et al 2015 xu et al 2016 compared the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy in four main channels in the zhoushan archipelago on the basis of the regional ocean modeling system roms outputs and found that the best site for tidal current power generation is the guishan hangmen channel the tidal range in the zhoushan archipelago is between 2 and 5 m and tidal currents between islands can be quite strong up to 4 m s 1 this not only plays a central role in the transport of heat pollutants suspended material etc but also significantly affects decision making for waterway management port and wharf construction tidal current energy exploitation and fishery activities therefore it is of great scientific and practical interest to study the tidal characteristics of the zhoushan archipelago in the past few decades on the basis of some short term observations from various stations e g cao et al 1996 chen et al 2003a b he et al 2013 lü and hu 2009 or numerical model results e g chen et al 2003c du et al 2007 hou et al 2015 shou et al 2009 xiong et al 2011 zhang et al 2005 the tidal features of the zhoushan archipelago have been studied by many researchers which established the basic understanding of tidal dynamics in this region according to these studies the general features of tides and tidal currents in the zhoushan archipelago are as follows the tidal waves enter the zhoushan archipelago from the northwest pacific ocean these waves after propagating into the east china sea bifurcate into two branches one toward the west northwest which partially enters the zhoushan archipelago and the other propagating toward the taiwan strait bao et al 2001 chen et al 2003a b the tidal waves in the zhoushan archipelago are dominated by the m2 tide followed by the s2 tide the o1 and k1 tides are relatively small the tides in hangzhou bay are mostly regular semidiurnal except within a small area in which they are irregular semidiurnal chen et al 2003a b the observed average and maximum tidal ranges are 1 9 3 3 m and 3 7 5 0 m respectively the average flood duration is 5 h 50 min while the average ebb duration is 6 h 35 min 45 min longer shou 2009 the tidal current here is regular semidiurnal chen et al 2003c and near open water is usually rotary but is rectilinear inside the channels because of the restriction of coastlines rong and li 2012 most previous studies of the tidal dynamics in the zhoushan archipelago were based on data collected from a limited number of stations e g cao et al 1996 chen et al 2003a 2003b he et al 2013 and numerical models had only relatively coarse grid resolutions 1 km e g chen et al 2003c du et al 2007 shou et al 2009 it is evident that none of these previous studies provides a clear picture of fine spatial structures of flows especially between islands moreover these previous studies were limited to the description of basic tidal characteristics such as the features of cotidal charts the spatial distribution of tidal current ellipses and the spatial variation of residual currents without a systematic analysis of physical mechanisms related to the tidal dynamics even though a few studies e g hou et al 2015 xiong et al 2011 adopted a high resolution 150 m numerical model to study the tidal dynamics in this region a systematic physical mechanism study is still lacking the temporal structure and spatial evolution of tides and tidal currents and relevant physical mechanisms in the zhoushan archipelago need to be further investigated because of the increasing economic importance of the area and environmental concerns related to it in this work we revisit this topic by using roms a state of the art three dimensional ocean model to further investigate tidal dynamics and relevant physical mechanisms in the zhoushan archipelago and examine momentum balance and the source of tidal asymmetry due to nonlinearity in this complex archipelago in contrast to most previous studies our approach differs as follows 1 we use a two way nested model grid fig 1 with a high resolution child grid average 260 m for the zhoushan archipelago to resolve the impacts of complex coastlines and islands on the tidal currents and waves 2 we conduct a numerical experiment and subsequent momentum balance analysis for the tidal characteristics and physical mechanisms including the effect of nonlinearity in particular the two pronounced shallow water tides m4 and m6 and their physical mechanisms are analyzed with a suite of numerical sensitivity tests 3 the jetlike flows occurring in a channel are presented and discussed the rest of this article is structured as follows section 2 describes the model setup and validation section 3 describes the general tidal features in the study area on the basis of the model results section 4 discusses the flood and ebb tidal currents and their associated vorticity further we diagnose the momentum balance to illustrate the dynamic mechanisms of tidal currents section 5 examines the sensitivity of the m4 and m6 tidal constituents to the nonlinear dynamics and different tidal forcing conditions at the open boundaries a summary is presented in section 6 2 model setup and validation 2 1 model setup roms http www myroms org a free surface terrain following three dimensional ocean model was used to conduct a numerical experiment in this study roms has been extensively used for numerous applications e g maccready et al 2009 marchesiello et al 2003 wilkin et al 2005 the detailed numerical algorithm for roms can be found in shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 for this study we designed a two way nested domain with a bigger domain parent embedding a smaller child domain see the box bounded by a red line in fig 1a such a design enables the two domains to communicate with each other the bigger domain fig 1a covers a large portion of east china coastal waters extending alongshore approximately 1100 km from 25 2 n to 35 1 n and offshore approximately 450 km from 121 e to 125 e a boundary fitted horizontal curvilinear grid with an array of 144 360 elements for the coordinates x y was designed to discretize the parent domain vertically 10 levels were used for the stretched terrain following coordinate s in the parent domain the grid spacing in the cross shore direction ranges from 1 01 km in the coastal region to 7 km in the open ocean in the alongshore direction a grid spacing with a higher resolution 1 km was designed for the middle parts of the parent domain and with a lower resolution 8 km for the remaining parts the reason for such a design is that we need a much higher resolution for the complex coastline and the zhoushan islands which may have important implications for tidal dynamics we obtained water depth data by merging gridded bathymetry data a global 30 interval grid from the gebco website http www gebco net with digitized water depths from navigation maps published by the china maritime safety administration to constrain the pressure gradient errors the model bathymetry data are often smoothed to ensure the maximum slope r h h is less than 0 25 bracco et al 2016 penven et al 2008 however the complex water depth distribution can produce strong velocity shears and oversmoothed bathymetry data may strongly affect the model results by reducing the velocity gradients therefore we performed only very modest smoothing for the combined bathymetry data to eliminate discontinuity between the two bathymetric datasets used in this study in our model we used constant water temperature and salinity barotropic tidal model we applied the tidal forcing with 13 tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 mf mm m4 ms4 mn4 obtained from topex poseidon global inverse solution version 7 0 tpxo 7 http volkov oce orst edu tides global html as the open boundary forcing in the parent domain we set the open boundary conditions as follows chapman conditions for the free surface flather conditions for the 2d momentum and radiation conditions for the 3d momentum marchesiello et al 2001 the mellor yamada level 2 5 turbulence closure scheme was implemented to parameterize the vertical mixing mellor and yamada 1982 the bottom stress was calculated with the quadratic law in accordance with previous studies e g cao and fang 1988 du et al 2007 fang et al 1985 li et al 1986 we set the spatial uniform bottom drag coefficient to be 0 00067 for the simulations see also the discussion for model calibration later because of the large tidal range in hangzhou bay a wet dry scheme was activated to ensure model stability during ebb tide the model was initialized from the quiescent state with a total 35 day run the time step was set to 90 s we used the last 30 day model output for the subsequent analysis the child domain has an array of a horizontal grid of 402 302 elements and 10 levels in the vertical same as the parent grid a ratio of 1 5 was set for the grid spacing between the child domain and the parent domain the average grid spacing was 260 m in the child domain such a high resolution grid enabled us to investigate the impact of numerous small islands on tidal motion in detail the open boundary conditions were provided with feedback to the parent domain 2 2 model validation and calibration to validate the model firstly we applied a harmonic analysis to the simulated sea level time series to obtain harmonic constants for the four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 we then compared the model based harmonic constants with those from 12 tide gauge stations shown in fig 1b the observed harmonic constants are from zhao 2014 as shown in table 1 the model results and observations agree with each other reasonably well the amplitude errors are mostly less than 10 cm and the phase errors are generally less than 15 the root mean square errors between the simulated and observed harmonic constants for m2 s2 k1 and o1 are 6 94 9 36 6 66 and 2 41 cm respectively in amplitude and 10 16 5 66 12 03 and 11 15 respectively in phase lag the modeled phase lags for diurnal tides k1 and o1 show some larger discrepancies with the observed ones and we suspect that this may be caused by the observed errors in phase because of their small amplitudes chen et al 2003b fang et al 1999 in addition wind forcing river runoff and stratification are all absent in our barotropic tide model which might induce some errors in the model results nevertheless the model produced cotidal charts for m2 s2 k1 and o1 see fig 2 show good consistency with the cotidal charts in the marine atlas of the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea atlas of the oceans editorial board 1993 since the comparisons with tide gauge stations are based on the output from the parent model with spatial resolution comparable to the spatial resolution of previous models e g chen et al 2003c the overall performance of the parent model is also comparable to that of the models of chen et al 2003c since the present study focuses mainly on barotropic tides our numerical simulations exclude the influences from river discharge wind and baroclinic currents the most important factors affecting tide and tidal currents in this region are coastline complexity bathymetric conditions and bottom stress these parameterizations are closely linked to the bottom drag coefficient with the high resolution model used in this study the complex coastlines can be well resolved in the simulations the factor that most likely affects the model results is the bottom drag coefficient through which the bottom stress is computed here we use the quadratic law τ b ρ c d u b 2 where ρ is the water density ub is the near bottom current and cd is the bottom drag coefficient some studies have shown that the simulated tide and tidal currents in this region are very sensitive to cd e g cao and fang 1988 du et al 2007 fang et al 1985 li et al 1986 fang et al 1985 suggested a range of cd 0 0005 0 00067 for this region li et al 1986 used a spatially uniform cd of 0 00067 in their simulation for the m2 tide in hangzhou bay and stated that this value produced the best results after evaluating a sensitivity test the cd of 0 00067 is much smaller than the 0 0026 used by hatayama et al 1996 to investigate the characteristics of tides and tidal currents in the indonesian archipelago and the 0 0025 used by hannah et al 2009 in simulating the tidal currents in the canadian arctic archipelago to choose a suitable cd value for the present study several spatially uniform cd values were selected for a sensitivity test 0 0003 0 0005 0 00067 0 001 and 0 0025 the sensitivity test results were compared with observations from 12 tide gauge stations fig 1 for the amplitude and phase of the m2 tide the dominant tidal constituent in this region the root mean square errors of the amplitude between the model and observations for cd 0 0003 0 0005 0 00067 0 001 and 0 0025 are 24 49 12 05 6 90 10 58 and 31 58 cm respectively and for the phase they are 13 65 11 50 10 16 8 47 and 8 95 respectively it is evident that cd 0 00067 produced the minimum error for the m2 tidal amplitude the phase error in each case does not show much difference therefore the spatially uniform cd of 0 00067 was chosen for the subsequent simulations 3 general tidal characteristics to obtain a better and more detailed understanding of the tides and tidal currents in the zhoushan archipelago on the basis of the high resolution model in this section we describe and analyze the general features of tidal properties cotidal charts tidal current ellipses and tidal energy flux and dissipation 3 1 tidal properties following chen et al 2003a su and yuan 2005 and gao et al 2015 the tidal form ratio f and tidal current form ratio g are defined as 1 f h k 1 h o 1 h m 2 and 2 g w k 1 w o 1 w m 2 respectively where h is the amplitude of tidal elevation w is the maximum tidal current velocity and subscripts 2 and 1 denote semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents respectively an alternative criterion is sometimes used e g pugh 1996 f hk1 h o1 h m2 h s2 however as suggested by su and yuan 2005 when the amplitude of the s2 tide is much smaller than that of the m2 tide as in the case of the zhoushan archipelago the criterion in eq 1 which frequently appears in most of the literature e g chen et al 2003a gao et al 2015 on tide and tidal currents in chinese nearshore waters should be used with the value of f tides can be classified into four categories regular semidiurnal tide 0 0 f 0 5 irregular semidiurnal tide 0 5 f 2 0 irregular diurnal tide 2 0 f 4 0 and regular diurnal tide f 4 0 the f values in this area are all less than 2 fig 3 a indicating that the zhoushan archipelago is dominated by semidiurnal tides in open water the f values are small 0 5 and the tides are regular semidiurnal tides in nearshore regions however the f values are larger and the contour line of f 0 5 encompasses most islands of the zhoushan archipelago indicating an irregular semidiurnal tide in these regions this is caused mainly by the tidal wave deformation that may produce some shallow water tidal constituents because of nonlinearity according to the classic dynamic tide theory see huang huang 2005 pp 74 76 the amplitudes of shallow water tides are proportional to r h 2 r h 3 here r is the amplitude of the dominant fundamental tidal constituent such as m2 or s2 and h is the water depth because m2 is the dominant tide in this region chen et al 2003a b also shown in fig 4 and the water depth is small near the coast 20 m or less fig 1c the amplitude of the m4 tide near the coast should not be ignored fig 4e this is because some of the tidal energy is transformed into that of the m4 tide and other shallow water tides such as ms4 it follows that the amplitude of the m2 tide in this region decreases while the amplitudes of the k1 and o1 tides do not change much fig 4a c d resulting in an increase in f this helps to explain why the nearshore waters are dominated by an irregular semidiurnal tide fig 3b shows the distribution of g values with g 0 5 indicating the regular semidiurnal tidal current is dominant and 0 5 g 2 0 implying the irregular semidiurnal tidal current is dominant as can be seen g is generally less than 0 5 in the study domain suggesting that the tidal flow here is mainly regular semidiurnal except for some tiny regions such as the waters to the southeast of taohua island the results presented here are consistent with the conclusions of chen et al 2003c mentioned in section 1 however the study of chen et al 2003c lacks more detailed quantification of spatial distributions for tide and tidal current forms f and g in the zhoushan archipelago because of its coarse model grids 1 8 km vs 0 26 km used in our model further the work was aimed at studying the tidal characteristics in the seas adjacent to zhejiang without much detail on the zhoushan archipelago 3 2 cotidal charts after conducting harmonic analysis on the simulated sea level records at each grid point we drew the cotidal charts for the four major tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 for both the parent domain and the child domain figs 2 and 4a d and two overtides of m2 m4 and m6 tides for the child domain fig 4e f the amplitudes figs 2 and 4 clearly demonstrate that semidiurnal tides are the significant constituents in this study area this is particularly true for the m2 tide which has a much larger amplitude than the other tides the averaged amplitudes of the m2 and s2 tides in the zhoushan archipelago are 1 11 and 0 44 m respectively whereas the amplitudes of the k1 and o1 tides are smaller only about 32 4 and 16 2 of the amplitude of the m2 tide respectively in general when propagating toward the coast tidal amplitudes tend to increase because of the geometrical convergence effects dyer 1973 however a striking feature of the two major semidiurnal tides m2 and s2 see fig 4a b is that their amplitudes decrease remarkably when they propagate into the zhoushan archipelago take the m2 tide for example its amplitude is about 1 3 m to the east of taohua island but decreases to 0 6 m in the luotou channel and then increases again after passing through the channel ren and yang 2008 suggested that this phenomenon is mainly due to the conversion of tidal potential energy to kinetic energy in the channels with a rapid change of cross sectional area the flow speed of the m2 tide in the narrow channels is much larger than that in the surrounding open water fig 5 a which can be explained by the bernoulli effect batchelor 1967 in addition the suddenly greater water depth in the channels disperses the tidal energy distribution and the high tidal energy dissipation due to the complex topography here may also contribute to the changes in the amplitudes of the tides zhang 2007 differently from semidiurnal tides the amplitudes of diurnal tides k1 and o1 basically increase as the tidal waves propagate westward in the zhoushan archipelago fig 4c d this is explained as follows since the zhoushan archipelago is dominated by semidiurnal tides the diurnal tidal current amplitudes are 1 order of magnitude smaller fig 5a d the influence of topographic change on the diurnal tides is relatively small this can be explained by the fact that the wavelength of a diurnal tide is much longer than that of a semidiurnal tide and hence the island has less effect because of refraction of the diurnal tidal waves therefore when diurnal tides enter the channels between islands some of the converged energy caused by the decreased cross sectional area may be converted into tidal potential energy and thereby increase the amplitudes of the two major diurnal tides k1 and o1 the amplitude of the m4 tide is significant in this region and shows an increasing trend when the m4 tide is propagating westward fig 4e the amplitude of the m6 tide is a little smaller than that of the m4 tide fig 4e f in addition its distribution is slightly different from that of the m4 tide with higher amplitude around daishan island fig 4f the generation of these two overtides may be due to advective nonlinear processes resulting from interactions between tidal currents and topography parker 1991 see also the detailed discussion in section 5 on the basis of the co phase lines which qualitatively reflect the direction and speed of tidal wave propagation figs 2 and 4 the general distributions of the phase lags of the s2 and o1 tides are similar to those of the m2 tide and the k1 tide respectively after propagating into the east china sea and approaching the coastal areas of zhejiang province the m2 tidal wave separates into two main branches with one propagating northwestward forming an amphidromic point in the south yellow sea due to the interactions between incoming and reflected waves bao et al 2001 and the other turning to the taiwan strait with another amphidromic point northeast of taiwan island fig 2a part of the northwestward propagating tidal wave enters the zhoushan archipelago and turns to the west figs 2a and 4a as for the m2 tide the s2 tide has similar co phase distributions with values about 30 greater according to the gradient of the co phase we can estimate the wave speed c which can be calculated by c l t where l is the distance between two adjacent co phase lines and t is the time taken by the wave to travel this distance it can be estimated that t g 360 t m2 where g is the phase difference between two adjacent co phase lines and t m2 is the period of the m2 tide obviously the m2 tide propagates faster in the offshore open water areas where l is large fig 2a with an average wave speed of approximately 37 5 m s 1 and more slowly in the zhoushan archipelago owing to a smaller l fig 4a with a mean wave speed of approximately 8 2 m s 1 it can be seen that even though the distributions of the two major diurnal tides k1 and o1 appear very different from those of semidiurnal tides fig 2c d they are all kelvin waves propagating southward along the coast as shown in fig 2c and d there is an amphidromic point for both the k1 tide and the o1 tide around which the two diurnal tides rotate counterclockwise the amphidromic point of the k1 tide is located at 123 2 e 34 n and that of the o1 tide is located at 123 e 33 5 n which are in good agreement with bao et al 2001 in general the cotidal charts presented here have higher spatial resolution than those in previous studies e g chen et al 2003c cheng 2009 li and rong 2012 zhang 2007 3 3 tidal current ellipses the semimajor semiminor axis of a tidal ellipse represents the maximum minimum velocity that the tidal current for the given constituent can reach the ratio of the minimum velocity to the maximum velocity indicates the direction of rotation of the tidal current a positive value indicates that the current will rotate counterclockwise over time otherwise it will rotate clockwise tidal current ellipses for the four major tides m2 s2 k1 o1 and two overtides m4 m6 were computed at each numerical grid point on the basis of model results for the depth averaged tidal current velocity their spatial distributions are shown in fig 5 at every 25 grid points the semidiurnal tidal currents fig 5a b increase in channels and shallow regions which is similar to the conclusions drawn by hatayama et al 1996 and choo and kim 2013 the tidal current ellipse for the two semidiurnal tides demonstrates strong rectilinear flows with the major axis closely following the channel orientation among the islands and shows a flow rotating clockwise with major axes roughly along the southeast northwest direction in open water in the eastern part of the study domain but shows both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations inside hangzhou bay the spatial distribution for tidal ellipses in a channel is similar to spatial distributions found in the canadian arctic archipelago by chen et al 2009 the general patterns of the tidal current ellipses for the m2 and s2 tides are close to their propagation directions mentioned above and are strongly controlled by the local topography whereas coriolis force is also believed to play a role rong and li 2012 the m2 tidal current has a amplitude of 0 35 0 7 m s 1 to the east of the zhoushan islands and about 1 5 3 3 m s 1 in the channels which is much larger than that of the s2 tide and nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of the k1 tide and the o1 tide fig 5c d since this region is dominated by semidiurnal tides the k1 and o1 diurnal tides are remarkably small fig 5c d with an average maximum current speed of only 0 14 and 0 07 m s 1 respectively the distributions of the major diurnal tidal current ellipses share a similar pattern in open water the major axis is oriented in the northeast southwest direction while in shallow waters and channels it is oriented east west which is more pronounced for the k1 tide the rotation direction of the tidal current ellipses of these two diurnal tides is predominantly clockwise north of daishan island but becomes mixed with clockwise and counterclockwise rotations south of daishan island it is striking that the speed of the m4 tidal current can be comparable to or even a little larger than that of the k1 tide in the channels fig 5e c and its average maximum speed is 0 11 m s 1 which is only a little less than that of the k1 tide 0 14 m s 1 such a strong m4 tidal current is attributed to nonlinear processes see the detailed discussion in section 5 the speed of the m6 tidal current is much less than that of the m4 tide fig 5f these two harmonic overtides of the m2 tide can cause significant tidal asymmetry chen et al 2003c xie et al 2012 2013 the generation mechanisms for the m4 and m6 tides are discussed in section 5 3 4 tidal energy flux and dissipation because of the complex topography in the zhoushan archipelago i e thousands of islands and many deep channels fig 1c this region is believed to be an ideal area where the tidal energy can be explored for power generation hou et al 2014 some studies on tidal energy in this region adopted a very coarse model grid owing to their focus on the entire east china coastal waters e g li et al 2005 zhu and liu 2012 it is worth mentioning that our results from the parent domain not shown here are generally consistent with these findings although previous studies e g li et al 2005 zhu and liu 2012 can give us a general understanding of tidal energy propagation and dissipation their focus was on large areas and they lack detailed spatial structure of the propagation and dissipation in the zhoushan archipelago hou et al 2014 estimated tidal current energy in the zhoushan archipelago with a high resolution model but they did not discuss the tidal energy budget in this subsection we present a more detailed discussion on the tidal energy budget in this area the time averaged tidal energy flux and dissipation can be calculated by the following two equations respectively davies and kwong 2000 gill 1982 greenberg 1979 3 e fx e fy ρ t t 0 0 1 u v h g ς u 2 v 2 2 d σ dt 4 d i s 1 t 0 t ρ c d v b 3 d s d t d i s 1 d v d i s 2 d h d i s 3 where efx efy and u v are the eastward and northward components of the tidal energy flux and the depth averaged tidal current velocity vector respectively t is the time interval for computation which we set here to 30 days ρ is the water density g is the acceleration due to gravity h x y is the water depth ς x y t is the tidal elevation dis the tidal energy dissipation which is composed of three terms on the right side of eq 4 where dis1 is the bottom boundary layer dissipation dis2 is the dissipation caused by vertical diffusion and dis3 is the dissipation caused by horizontal diffusion respectively cd is for the bottom friction coefficient and v b is the bottom tidal current vector dis2 and dis3 will not be considered here to calculate the tidal energy dissipation for convenience since their magnitudes are relatively smaller than that of dis1 fig 6 a presents the spatial distribution of the depth integrated energy flux it can be seen that tidal energy entering the zhoushan archipelago may be divided into two parts fig 6c one from the eastern boundary of the study domain that accounts for 73 8 of the total incoming tidal energy flux 7 09 gw and the other from the southern boundary that accounts for the remaining part 2 52 gw some of the incoming tidal energy 2 56 gw exits the area and enters the upper part of hangzhou bay to the western boundary of our model domain fig 6c and some 2 59 gw flows out of the study domain through the northern boundary it is notable that the energy flux is enhanced in channels such as the guanmen channel and the luotou channel where a pronounced increase in flow speed is observed figs 6a and 7 additionally it can be seen that the direction of the tidal energy flux is basically parallel to that of the major axis of semidiurnal tidal current ellipses figs 5a b and 6a and semidiurnal tidal wave propagation fig 4a b indicating that the tidal energy in this region is dominated by the semidiurnal tides the distribution of the tidal energy dissipation rate per unit area only for dis1 is shown in fig 6b as can be seen there are many energy dissipation hotspots in channels or where the tidal current speed is high because of geomorphic constriction zhong and li 2006 in open water east of the study domain the magnitude of energy dissipation is relatively small and basically ranges from 0 01 to 0 1 w m 2 however in channels and shallow water regions the dissipation is enhanced especially in narrow channels where the values are generally higher than 1 w m 2 and even larger than 10 w m 2 in places as expected this distribution of energy dissipation is consistent with that of the current speed figs 6b and 7 this is not surprising because dis1 is determined mainly by current speed given that only dis1 is considered the actual total dissipated energy is greater than that estimated here a simple tidal energy budget can be given on the basis of fig 6c the total incoming energy is 9 61 gw 7 09 gw 2 52 gw with 5 15 gw 2 56 gw 2 59 gw being transported out of the domain and 3 0 gw dissipating because of the bottom friction inside the study area fig 6c as a result the residual energy 1 46 gw is dissipated because of the terms dis2 and dis3 in addition the eddies generated around the islands fig 8 may also consume some of the tidal energy which is worthy of further study 4 discussion of the mechanism of tidal currents 4 1 simulated tidal current the simulated depth and time averaged tidal current vector fields during flood and ebb are shown in fig 7 the flow speed is generally enhanced in the channels and shallow water regions the mean current speed during ebb can reach 2 5 m s 1 during spring tide in narrow channels such as the xiazhimen channel fig 7b the simulated maximum current speed 4 67 m s 1 in the xiazhimen channel is slightly greater than that observed 4 0 m s 1 e g chen et al 2003b feng et al 1999 this discrepancy is probably due to the small bottom drag coefficient 0 00067 used for the simulation except for this difference our model results are generally consistent with the observed values chen et al 2003b one of the remarkable features is that flood ebb asymmetry can be found in the tidal current the mean flow speed of ebb tide is slightly greater than that of flood tide fig 7 which is in agreement with xie et al 2012 2013 who claimed that there is ebb dominance in the southern part of hangzhou bay on the basis of their model results the tidal asymmetry is pronounced in some channels such as the guishan hangmen channel where the maximum flow speed is approximately 4 49 m s 1 during ebb but approximately 3 68 m s 1 during flood at one certain location 4 2 jetlike flows jetlike flow across channels is one of the typical features shown in model results e g ding 2008 feng 2012 and in observations ren and yang 2008 however there is a lack of study of fine spatial structures and relevant dynamics for simplicity here we choose only two typical channels for discussion the guishan hangmen channel and the guanmen channel see the red box in fig 7 and fig 1c for their locations during ebb the averaged tidal current is seen to flow out through the bay s mouth when it passes through the channels in the zhoushan archipelago the velocity increases markedly and intense jetlike flows are formed especially in these two channels with a maximum average speed above 2 0 m s 1 figs 7b and 8b during flood however this feature jetlike flows is not as significant as during ebb when the flood current confronts the guishan hangmen channel part of it turns around and forms a counterclockwise eddy which should consume some tidal energy and reduce the strength of jetlike flow thus the existence of numerous islands of various sizes may impede flood current but may have a small impact on ebb current which gives rise to the ebb dominant tide here because of the jetlike flow a strong velocity shear appears in the cross channel direction fig 8a b such a large horizontal tidal current shear produces negative anticyclonic and positive cyclonic vorticities respectively on the left and right sides of the island facing downstream fig 8c d the high values of the surface vorticity normalized by the coriolis frequency f adjacent to the islands fig 8c d indicate that the flows are highly nonlinear in nature some interesting questions arise regarding the jetlike flow for example what is its width how deep it is to answer these questions the guishan hangmen channel is selected fig 9 during ebb a clear jet can be seen in the middle of the channel fig 9b with a flow speed of approximately 3 8 m s 1 and a horizontal width of approximately 570 m reaching a depth of approximately 6 5 m in addition the velocity field shows strong horizontal and vertical shears 4 3 tidally averaged momentum balance to gain insight into the dynamics in the channels here we follow hench and luettich 2003 to estimate the contribution of each term in the x and y momentum equations on the basis of the model output and the following two equations 5 u t u u x v u y f v 1 ρ p x υ δ u c d u 2 v 2 h u 0 6 v t u v x v v y f u 1 ρ p y υ δ v c d u 2 v 2 h v 0 acc hadv cor pre visc bstr where f is the coriolis parameter p is the pressure υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient δ 2 x 2 2 y 2 is the horizontal diffusion operator and h x y t h x y ς x y t is the total water depth acc hadv cor pre visc and bstr stand for the local acceleration horizontal nonlinear advection coriolis force pressure gradient turbulent viscosity and bottom friction terms respectively figs 10 and 11 show the spatial distributions of average values of five terms hadv pre acc cor and bstr during one flood and ebb period respectively the visc term is not presented because of its very small magnitude in comparison with other five terms during both flood and ebb the hadv and pre terms are dominant terms being at least 1 order of magnitude greater than the other three balancing the momentum with a generally opposite relationship of their spatial distributions figs 10a d and 11a d it is worth noting that the spatial distributions of the hadv and pre terms are basically consistent during flood and ebb periods respectively with positive and negative values interlaced around the islands on the basis of this state we can speculate that the islands can cause great fluctuations in the tidal current and water level around them and this effect will decrease as we move away from the islands furthermore the spatial distributions of the current and water level fluctuation are also similar during flood and ebb respectively which causes the water levels in some locations near the islands to be usually lower or higher than those of their surrounding waters the bernoulli effect may be used to explain this phenomenon the pressure in the location where the current speed is high is low and causes a low water level in addition the eddies generated by the variation of water depth may be another reason limited by the islands coastlines the tidal current here leads to more x direction component which accounts for the slightly higher values of the acc and bstr terms in the x direction and of the cor term in the y direction for better accuracy we choose six representative stations a1 a2 a3 a4 b1 and b2 fig 10j for analysis among them a1 a2 a3 and a4 help describe the tidal dynamics in the narrow channels while b1 and b2 help demonstrate the tidal dynamics of surrounding waters instead of averaging over one flood or ebb period as shown in figs 10 and 11 here we average the absolute values of each term over one tidal period the results in the x and y directions are listed in tables 2 and 3 absolute values are used in the calculations to reduce the effect of residual current so that we can focus on the momentum balance caused mainly by tides as demonstrated in the spatial distributions figs 10 and 11 the momentum balance at the six points is primarily between the hadv term and the pre term which is most prominent in the channels a1 a2 a3 and a4 for station a1 since the tidal current is mainly in the x direction the significant terms hadv 91 18 10 5 m s2 and pre 101 11 10 5 m s2 are about 3 6 and 5 5 orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding two terms in the y momentum equation table 3 suggesting a predominant bernoulli type balance in the x direction however at station a2 where the tidal current mainly runs in the y direction the result is the opposite the values of the hadv and pre terms in the y direction are much higher than those in the x direction similarly the current at station a3 or station a4 is directed roughly northeast southwest or southeast northwest producing comparable values of the hadv and pre terms in the x and y directions for these stations a1 a2 a3 and a4 in the x direction the acc term plays a secondary role in the balance followed by the bstr and cor terms in that order in the y direction the cor term becomes greater to be comparable to or larger than the acc term in both the x direction and the y direction the visc term has the smallest magnitude and this is why it is not shown in figs 10 and 11 at stations b1 and b2 away from the channels the magnitudes of all five terms decrease with the most significant reduction in the hadv and pre terms in the x direction the hadv term becomes smaller than the acc term and the pre term is only a little larger than the acc term which means that the hadv term is no longer as important as it in the channels the same situation occurs in the y direction but with a much smaller acc term as the consequence of the nearly west east flow at these two stations comparing the results for the six stations and also taking previous analysis into consideration we conclude that the islands have a significant impact on the tidal current and water level in this region leading to jetlike flows and higher nonlinearity in the channels therefore it is of great interest to further study the influence of islands and complex topographies on tides according to our findings and those of studies in other regions e g hatayama et al 1996 hench and luettich 2003 sheng and wang 2004 choo and kim 2013 it is evident that there is strong nonlinearity in the flow because of strong geometric and topographic gradients and the horizontal advection is dominant in the momentum balance 5 sensitivity studies on shallow water tides the shallow water tidal constituents generated in coastal waters are of great importance to the tidal wave morphology and tidal asymmetry huang et al 2008 li and dong 2013 song et al 2016 the strong overtides of m2 were reported years ago in this region e g chen et al 2003a b c however their generation mechanisms have never been explored in this section we report a sensitivity study with six numerical experiments to discuss the generation mechanisms for the m4 and m6 overtides table 4 generated by nonlinearity the results from the control run were extensively discussed in the preceding sections here we discuss only the sensitivity test results to quantitatively describe the variations in the sensitivity test results with reference to the control run result the relative variation ratio rvr is defined as follows 7 r v r e t s e t c e t c 100 where the subscripts s and c represent the sensitivity test result and the control run result respectively and 8 e t i 1 m s a l i 2 s a s i 2 where m is the total model grids i is the model grid point sal is the semimajor axis of the tidal ellipse and sas is the semiminor axis of the tidal ellipse the rvr and et values are listed in table 5 in case 1 we replace the quadratic bottom friction used in the control run with linear bottom friction in comparison with the control run fig 5e f the variation in the m4 tidal ellipse is not significant fig 12 a and only a small increase in the current speed occurred somewhere with rvr of 7 34 for the m6 tide fig 12b the change is much smaller with rvr of 0 71 hence nonlinear processes from the bottom friction term are not the dominant factor in generating the m4 and m6 tides in case 2 without the nonlinear advection term in the horizontal momentum equations some striking differences are observed fig 12c d in contrast to the control run for example the m4 and m6 tidal current speeds decrease significantly especially in some narrow channels and the average size of the ellipses is reduced dramatically rvr for the m4 and m6 tides is 54 56 and 49 82 respectively indicating that the current speed is decreased by half compared with that in the control run therefore it is evident that the nonlinear advection term plays a critical role in generating the m4 tide and the m6 tide and the effect of nonlinear bottom friction is negligible for the m4 tide our sensitivity test results are consistent with the results of previous studies e g pingree and maddock 1978 sheng and wang 2004 while for the m6 tide the present results are different from previous results outside the zhoushan archipelago e g fang 1987 parker 1991 sheng and wang 2004 in which quadratic bottom friction plays an important role in generating the m6 tide we attribute this discrepancy to the following two possible reasons 1 according to eq 13 in zhu et al 2016 the flow speed of the m6 tide is proportional to the bottom drag coefficient cd therefore because of the small cd 0 00067 compared with a standard value of 0 0025 the bottom friction effect is small in the first place and thus the difference between linear and nonlinear bottom frictions is also very limited 2 owing to the study domain having numerous channels the main dynamic balance is between the horizontal advection term hadv and the pressure gradient force term pre as shown in tables 2 and 3 the bottom friction term bstr is nearly 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the hadv term and hence the variations between results from linear and quadratic bottom frictions are much smaller compared with the hadv term to examine whether the forcing exerted by shallow water tides at the open boundaries has a role in generating the m4 and m6 tides inside our model domain we reran the model without the shallow water tidal constituents m4 ms4 mn4 at the open boundaries case 3 as shown in figs 12e and 12f the m4 and m6 current ellipses obtained show changes in their size to some degree compared with those of the control run fig 5e f with rvr of 12 41 and 2 60 for the m4 tide and the m6 tide respectively which implies that the two overtides considered here are mainly produced locally it is interesting to check whether the forcing provided by the m2 tide alone at the open boundaries can produce strong m4 and m6 tidal currents inside the study domain for that purpose we reran the model with only the m2 tide at the open boundaries case 4 in contrast to the control run it is surprising that the m6 tidal current speed increased significantly at almost all grid points especially in the channels with rvr of 86 20 fig 12g h the maximum speed of the m6 tide increases from 0 34 m s 1 in the control run to 0 6 m s 1 in this case for the m4 tide the speed increase is much smaller with rvr of 18 15 however after addition of the s2 tide forcing at the open boundaries based on case 4 case 5 the sizes of the m4 and m6 tidal current ellipses fig 12i j are generally smaller than in case 4 with rvr of 19 90 and 41 55 for the m4 tide and the m6 tide respectively this demonstrates that the s2 tide has a negative effect on the generation of the m4 and m6 tides perhaps due to the nonlinear interactions between m2 and s2 tides that generate other compound tides such as ms4 and ms6 and thus a reduction of energy conversion to the m4 and m6 tidal constituents through a nonlinear effect just like kowalik and proshutinsky 1993 supposed that the possible interaction between m2 and diurnal tides may lead to damping of the diurnal tides in the final experiment we exclude the m2 tide forcing at the open boundaries case 6 the sizes of the m4 and m6 tidal current ellipses both decrease remarkably in this case fig 12k l with rvr of 70 45 and 79 58 for the m4 tide and the m6 tide respectively on the basis of the results of these six experiments we conclude that the dominant generation mechanisms for m4 and m6 tides are the advection of momentum and interactions in channels and shallow waters with the primary forcing from the m2 tide at the boundary while the nonlinear effect from the bottom friction makes only a small contribution to overtide production the generation of compound tides and overtides is commonly believed to be attributed to an inherently nonlinear condition in shallow water regions dronkers 1964 the strength of the shallow water tides depends on the fundamental tidal constituent s aubrey and speer 1985 huang and huang 2005 since m2 is the most pronounced tidal constituent in this region it is natural that m4 is the most energetic shallow water tide parker 1991 zhu et al 2016 6 summary in this study a high resolution 260 m three dimensional numerical model roms was applied to study the barotropic tide tidal current and associated dynamic mechanisms in the zhoushan archipelago the simulated harmonic constants and cotidal charts agree well with the observations the model was validated by comparison with previous results in general the simulated tidal ellipses and cotidal charts presented here have higher spatial resolution than in previous studies e g chen et al 2003c cheng 2009 li and rong 2012 zhang 2007 the features of the simulated cotidal chart for the barotropic tide in the parent domain can be interpreted as a result of kelvin waves which have the highest amplitude near the shore and decay exponentially offshore leblond and mysak 1978 the tidal type in the zhoushan archipelago is generally characterized by an irregular semidiurnal tide in the island concentrated regions but a regular semidiurnal tide away from the islands the tidal currents are mainly regular semidiurnal in this region the m2 tide is dominant delineating the basic tidal dynamic features in the study domain propagating toward the west northwest with the amplitude significantly decreasing in channels and shallow water regions the distributions of phase lag and amplitude for the s2 tide are similar to those of the m2 tide while the mean amplitude is only two fifths of that of the m2 tide the k1 and o1 tides are two major diurnal components sharing similar distribution patterns of amplitude and phase lag with the amplitude of k1 being greater than that of o1 it is striking that the amplitudes of these two diurnal tides show increasing trends toward the western part of the study domain in short the m2 tide is dominant followed by the s2 k1 and o1 tides in that order the spatial distribution of tidal ellipses for the m2 and s2 tides shares a common pattern in that the orientation of the major axis generally aligns with a channel between islands exhibiting a rectilinear flow while in open water the flow shows somewhat rotational features the tidal ellipses for the k1 and o1 tides have a similar spatial distribution while their sizes are small compared with those of the m2 tide the barotropic tidal energy budget in the zhoushan archipelago was also evaluated the total incoming energy is 9 61 gw with 5 15 gw flowing out of the study area and 3 0 gw dissipated due to bottom friction inside the study area fig 6c as a result the residual energy 1 46 gw is dissipated by horizontal and vertical diffusions in addition the eddies generated around the islands may also consume some of the tidal energy there are many energy dissipation hotspots in the channels where the tidal current speed is high a jetlike flow in a channel is one of the most remarkable features such as the flow in the guishan hangmen channel whose width can occupy the most of the channel and the depth of the main part can almost reach the seafloor although there have been many studies on tides along the zhejiang coast or in the zhoushan archipelago an analysis of the dynamic mechanism was lacking in this work dynamic balance analysis of tidal currents was performed for a small region containing the guishan hangmen channel and the guanmen channel and also for six points inside this region it was found that the primary balance near the islands is between the horizontal advection term hadv and the pressure gradient force pre suggesting a predominant bernoulli type tidal motion with strong nonlinearity caused by the complex topography at a distance from the islands however the values of the hadv and pre terms become very small with magnitude comparable to that of the acc term which means that the nonlinearity of the tidal current here is no longer as important as it in the channels furthermore among the islands there are many low or high value centers of water level throughout the entire tidal cycle the bernoulli effect and variation of water depth may be used to explain this thus the islands have an important effect on the tidal current and water level generating jetlike flows in the channels and making the tides more nonlinear the strong overtides of m2 were reported years ago in this region e g chen et al 2003a b c however their generation mechanisms had never been explored to find out the generation mechanism for the m4 and m6 tides we conducted six sensitivity experiments the results demonstrate that the m4 and m6 tides are mainly generated by nonlinear advection and the bottom friction plays a minor role different tidal forcing conditions at the open boundaries have different effects on the generation of shallow water tides the m4 and m6 tides are generally produced locally by nonlinear processes as the m2 tide propagates to shallow water areas rather than propagating into the area from the open boundary also we find that the s2 tide may have a negative effect on the generation of the m4 and m6 tides acknowledgments we thank four anonymous reviewers and an editor for their insightful comments and suggestions this study was jointly supported by the national key r d

24074,a complex archipelago exhibits high velocity shear strong advection and significant nonlinearity for tides overtides tidal currents and subtidal hydrodynamics here a high resolution regional ocean modeling system with two way nesting is applied to the coastal zhoushan archipelago in the east china sea after validation for the m2 s2 k1 and o1 tidal constituents the spatial structures of tides and tidal currents are presented the features of these constituents and two significant overtides of m2 m4 and m6 are discussed the m2 tide is dominant in the study domain followed by the s2 k1 and o1 tides in amplitude in that order tidal energy budget analysis shows that about 46 4 of the incoming energy is dissipated inside the study area and 67 3 of the dissipated energy is consumed by the bottom friction while the remainder passes through the study domain jetlike flows in the channels are among the most remarkable features analysis of momentum balance terms averaged over the flood or ebb period demonstrates that the primary balance near the islands is between the horizontal advection and the pressure gradient force suggesting a predominant bernoulli type motion with strong nonlinearity however in the area away from the islands the horizontal advection becomes less important the m4 and m6 tides are mainly generated by nonlinear advection bottom friction plays a minor role and the interactions between different constituents also have some influence keywords zhoushan archipelago tidal dynamics overtides numerical model jet through islands 1 introduction an archipelago with complicated coastlines numerous islands narrow channels and rugged bottom topography is one of most complex geographies in the ocean the complicated topography tides and tidal currents in an archipelago present a complex dynamic system which has attracted considerable interest for decades hatayama et al 1996 investigated the characteristics of tides and tidal currents in the indonesian archipelago in the java sea and found relatively strong tidal currents in the vicinities of narrow straits e g the lombok strait and malacca strait hannah et al 2009 simulated tidal currents in the canadian arctic archipelago and reported that large velocity is generally found in narrow channels and shallow areas choo and kim 2013 demonstrated that rapid depth changes and narrow channels play important roles in the tidal dynamics in an archipelago using a relatively high resolution 1 km numerical model chen et al 2009 studied the complex tidal structure and energy flux along the coast particularly in the narrow straits of the canadian arctic archipelago and highlighted that horizontal resolution and geometric fitting are two prerequisites to realistically model the tidal dynamics in such a complex topographic region numerical studies with high spatial resolution are essential to resolve numerous islands and channels for reliable quantification of exchange flows with the shelf in an attempt to develop a regional ocean prediction model for the philippine archipelago arango et al 2011 stressed that finer resolution e g 2 km is needed to resolve the interisland passages the zhoushan archipelago consists of 1390 islands and 3306 reefs near the western edge of the east china sea and the southeastern end of hangzhou bay fig 1 it covers about 20 800 km2 of water and 1440 12 km2 of land the zhoushan archipelago is a pivotal marine gateway of east china to the world the government approved the establishment of the zhoushan archipelago new district in july 2011 and announced zhoushan as one of the seven free trade areas in august 2016 with these developments a variety of human activities such as reclamation port terminal construction and waterway regulation will significantly influence the marine environment of the zhoushan archipelago which used to be pristine remote vegetated islands and ocean abundant in fish for example sewage discharged into the sea will deteriorate the water quality the reclamation may strongly impact the tidal dynamics in areas of construction which can potentially induce seabed erosion or deposition in addition the zhoushan archipelago is ideal for harvesting tidal energy to generate electricity hou et al 2015 the water depth in this area varies greatly fig 1c it is about 30 m in the nearshore region while many narrow channels between islands are much deeper e g up to 130 m in the jintang channel with large gradients this kind of topography is conducive to the formation of strong currents convergence of tidal current and convenient use of tidal energy hou et al 2015 xu et al 2016 compared the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy in four main channels in the zhoushan archipelago on the basis of the regional ocean modeling system roms outputs and found that the best site for tidal current power generation is the guishan hangmen channel the tidal range in the zhoushan archipelago is between 2 and 5 m and tidal currents between islands can be quite strong up to 4 m s 1 this not only plays a central role in the transport of heat pollutants suspended material etc but also significantly affects decision making for waterway management port and wharf construction tidal current energy exploitation and fishery activities therefore it is of great scientific and practical interest to study the tidal characteristics of the zhoushan archipelago in the past few decades on the basis of some short term observations from various stations e g cao et al 1996 chen et al 2003a b he et al 2013 lü and hu 2009 or numerical model results e g chen et al 2003c du et al 2007 hou et al 2015 shou et al 2009 xiong et al 2011 zhang et al 2005 the tidal features of the zhoushan archipelago have been studied by many researchers which established the basic understanding of tidal dynamics in this region according to these studies the general features of tides and tidal currents in the zhoushan archipelago are as follows the tidal waves enter the zhoushan archipelago from the northwest pacific ocean these waves after propagating into the east china sea bifurcate into two branches one toward the west northwest which partially enters the zhoushan archipelago and the other propagating toward the taiwan strait bao et al 2001 chen et al 2003a b the tidal waves in the zhoushan archipelago are dominated by the m2 tide followed by the s2 tide the o1 and k1 tides are relatively small the tides in hangzhou bay are mostly regular semidiurnal except within a small area in which they are irregular semidiurnal chen et al 2003a b the observed average and maximum tidal ranges are 1 9 3 3 m and 3 7 5 0 m respectively the average flood duration is 5 h 50 min while the average ebb duration is 6 h 35 min 45 min longer shou 2009 the tidal current here is regular semidiurnal chen et al 2003c and near open water is usually rotary but is rectilinear inside the channels because of the restriction of coastlines rong and li 2012 most previous studies of the tidal dynamics in the zhoushan archipelago were based on data collected from a limited number of stations e g cao et al 1996 chen et al 2003a 2003b he et al 2013 and numerical models had only relatively coarse grid resolutions 1 km e g chen et al 2003c du et al 2007 shou et al 2009 it is evident that none of these previous studies provides a clear picture of fine spatial structures of flows especially between islands moreover these previous studies were limited to the description of basic tidal characteristics such as the features of cotidal charts the spatial distribution of tidal current ellipses and the spatial variation of residual currents without a systematic analysis of physical mechanisms related to the tidal dynamics even though a few studies e g hou et al 2015 xiong et al 2011 adopted a high resolution 150 m numerical model to study the tidal dynamics in this region a systematic physical mechanism study is still lacking the temporal structure and spatial evolution of tides and tidal currents and relevant physical mechanisms in the zhoushan archipelago need to be further investigated because of the increasing economic importance of the area and environmental concerns related to it in this work we revisit this topic by using roms a state of the art three dimensional ocean model to further investigate tidal dynamics and relevant physical mechanisms in the zhoushan archipelago and examine momentum balance and the source of tidal asymmetry due to nonlinearity in this complex archipelago in contrast to most previous studies our approach differs as follows 1 we use a two way nested model grid fig 1 with a high resolution child grid average 260 m for the zhoushan archipelago to resolve the impacts of complex coastlines and islands on the tidal currents and waves 2 we conduct a numerical experiment and subsequent momentum balance analysis for the tidal characteristics and physical mechanisms including the effect of nonlinearity in particular the two pronounced shallow water tides m4 and m6 and their physical mechanisms are analyzed with a suite of numerical sensitivity tests 3 the jetlike flows occurring in a channel are presented and discussed the rest of this article is structured as follows section 2 describes the model setup and validation section 3 describes the general tidal features in the study area on the basis of the model results section 4 discusses the flood and ebb tidal currents and their associated vorticity further we diagnose the momentum balance to illustrate the dynamic mechanisms of tidal currents section 5 examines the sensitivity of the m4 and m6 tidal constituents to the nonlinear dynamics and different tidal forcing conditions at the open boundaries a summary is presented in section 6 2 model setup and validation 2 1 model setup roms http www myroms org a free surface terrain following three dimensional ocean model was used to conduct a numerical experiment in this study roms has been extensively used for numerous applications e g maccready et al 2009 marchesiello et al 2003 wilkin et al 2005 the detailed numerical algorithm for roms can be found in shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 for this study we designed a two way nested domain with a bigger domain parent embedding a smaller child domain see the box bounded by a red line in fig 1a such a design enables the two domains to communicate with each other the bigger domain fig 1a covers a large portion of east china coastal waters extending alongshore approximately 1100 km from 25 2 n to 35 1 n and offshore approximately 450 km from 121 e to 125 e a boundary fitted horizontal curvilinear grid with an array of 144 360 elements for the coordinates x y was designed to discretize the parent domain vertically 10 levels were used for the stretched terrain following coordinate s in the parent domain the grid spacing in the cross shore direction ranges from 1 01 km in the coastal region to 7 km in the open ocean in the alongshore direction a grid spacing with a higher resolution 1 km was designed for the middle parts of the parent domain and with a lower resolution 8 km for the remaining parts the reason for such a design is that we need a much higher resolution for the complex coastline and the zhoushan islands which may have important implications for tidal dynamics we obtained water depth data by merging gridded bathymetry data a global 30 interval grid from the gebco website http www gebco net with digitized water depths from navigation maps published by the china maritime safety administration to constrain the pressure gradient errors the model bathymetry data are often smoothed to ensure the maximum slope r h h is less than 0 25 bracco et al 2016 penven et al 2008 however the complex water depth distribution can produce strong velocity shears and oversmoothed bathymetry data may strongly affect the model results by reducing the velocity gradients therefore we performed only very modest smoothing for the combined bathymetry data to eliminate discontinuity between the two bathymetric datasets used in this study in our model we used constant water temperature and salinity barotropic tidal model we applied the tidal forcing with 13 tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 q1 mf mm m4 ms4 mn4 obtained from topex poseidon global inverse solution version 7 0 tpxo 7 http volkov oce orst edu tides global html as the open boundary forcing in the parent domain we set the open boundary conditions as follows chapman conditions for the free surface flather conditions for the 2d momentum and radiation conditions for the 3d momentum marchesiello et al 2001 the mellor yamada level 2 5 turbulence closure scheme was implemented to parameterize the vertical mixing mellor and yamada 1982 the bottom stress was calculated with the quadratic law in accordance with previous studies e g cao and fang 1988 du et al 2007 fang et al 1985 li et al 1986 we set the spatial uniform bottom drag coefficient to be 0 00067 for the simulations see also the discussion for model calibration later because of the large tidal range in hangzhou bay a wet dry scheme was activated to ensure model stability during ebb tide the model was initialized from the quiescent state with a total 35 day run the time step was set to 90 s we used the last 30 day model output for the subsequent analysis the child domain has an array of a horizontal grid of 402 302 elements and 10 levels in the vertical same as the parent grid a ratio of 1 5 was set for the grid spacing between the child domain and the parent domain the average grid spacing was 260 m in the child domain such a high resolution grid enabled us to investigate the impact of numerous small islands on tidal motion in detail the open boundary conditions were provided with feedback to the parent domain 2 2 model validation and calibration to validate the model firstly we applied a harmonic analysis to the simulated sea level time series to obtain harmonic constants for the four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 we then compared the model based harmonic constants with those from 12 tide gauge stations shown in fig 1b the observed harmonic constants are from zhao 2014 as shown in table 1 the model results and observations agree with each other reasonably well the amplitude errors are mostly less than 10 cm and the phase errors are generally less than 15 the root mean square errors between the simulated and observed harmonic constants for m2 s2 k1 and o1 are 6 94 9 36 6 66 and 2 41 cm respectively in amplitude and 10 16 5 66 12 03 and 11 15 respectively in phase lag the modeled phase lags for diurnal tides k1 and o1 show some larger discrepancies with the observed ones and we suspect that this may be caused by the observed errors in phase because of their small amplitudes chen et al 2003b fang et al 1999 in addition wind forcing river runoff and stratification are all absent in our barotropic tide model which might induce some errors in the model results nevertheless the model produced cotidal charts for m2 s2 k1 and o1 see fig 2 show good consistency with the cotidal charts in the marine atlas of the bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea atlas of the oceans editorial board 1993 since the comparisons with tide gauge stations are based on the output from the parent model with spatial resolution comparable to the spatial resolution of previous models e g chen et al 2003c the overall performance of the parent model is also comparable to that of the models of chen et al 2003c since the present study focuses mainly on barotropic tides our numerical simulations exclude the influences from river discharge wind and baroclinic currents the most important factors affecting tide and tidal currents in this region are coastline complexity bathymetric conditions and bottom stress these parameterizations are closely linked to the bottom drag coefficient with the high resolution model used in this study the complex coastlines can be well resolved in the simulations the factor that most likely affects the model results is the bottom drag coefficient through which the bottom stress is computed here we use the quadratic law τ b ρ c d u b 2 where ρ is the water density ub is the near bottom current and cd is the bottom drag coefficient some studies have shown that the simulated tide and tidal currents in this region are very sensitive to cd e g cao and fang 1988 du et al 2007 fang et al 1985 li et al 1986 fang et al 1985 suggested a range of cd 0 0005 0 00067 for this region li et al 1986 used a spatially uniform cd of 0 00067 in their simulation for the m2 tide in hangzhou bay and stated that this value produced the best results after evaluating a sensitivity test the cd of 0 00067 is much smaller than the 0 0026 used by hatayama et al 1996 to investigate the characteristics of tides and tidal currents in the indonesian archipelago and the 0 0025 used by hannah et al 2009 in simulating the tidal currents in the canadian arctic archipelago to choose a suitable cd value for the present study several spatially uniform cd values were selected for a sensitivity test 0 0003 0 0005 0 00067 0 001 and 0 0025 the sensitivity test results were compared with observations from 12 tide gauge stations fig 1 for the amplitude and phase of the m2 tide the dominant tidal constituent in this region the root mean square errors of the amplitude between the model and observations for cd 0 0003 0 0005 0 00067 0 001 and 0 0025 are 24 49 12 05 6 90 10 58 and 31 58 cm respectively and for the phase they are 13 65 11 50 10 16 8 47 and 8 95 respectively it is evident that cd 0 00067 produced the minimum error for the m2 tidal amplitude the phase error in each case does not show much difference therefore the spatially uniform cd of 0 00067 was chosen for the subsequent simulations 3 general tidal characteristics to obtain a better and more detailed understanding of the tides and tidal currents in the zhoushan archipelago on the basis of the high resolution model in this section we describe and analyze the general features of tidal properties cotidal charts tidal current ellipses and tidal energy flux and dissipation 3 1 tidal properties following chen et al 2003a su and yuan 2005 and gao et al 2015 the tidal form ratio f and tidal current form ratio g are defined as 1 f h k 1 h o 1 h m 2 and 2 g w k 1 w o 1 w m 2 respectively where h is the amplitude of tidal elevation w is the maximum tidal current velocity and subscripts 2 and 1 denote semidiurnal and diurnal tidal constituents respectively an alternative criterion is sometimes used e g pugh 1996 f hk1 h o1 h m2 h s2 however as suggested by su and yuan 2005 when the amplitude of the s2 tide is much smaller than that of the m2 tide as in the case of the zhoushan archipelago the criterion in eq 1 which frequently appears in most of the literature e g chen et al 2003a gao et al 2015 on tide and tidal currents in chinese nearshore waters should be used with the value of f tides can be classified into four categories regular semidiurnal tide 0 0 f 0 5 irregular semidiurnal tide 0 5 f 2 0 irregular diurnal tide 2 0 f 4 0 and regular diurnal tide f 4 0 the f values in this area are all less than 2 fig 3 a indicating that the zhoushan archipelago is dominated by semidiurnal tides in open water the f values are small 0 5 and the tides are regular semidiurnal tides in nearshore regions however the f values are larger and the contour line of f 0 5 encompasses most islands of the zhoushan archipelago indicating an irregular semidiurnal tide in these regions this is caused mainly by the tidal wave deformation that may produce some shallow water tidal constituents because of nonlinearity according to the classic dynamic tide theory see huang huang 2005 pp 74 76 the amplitudes of shallow water tides are proportional to r h 2 r h 3 here r is the amplitude of the dominant fundamental tidal constituent such as m2 or s2 and h is the water depth because m2 is the dominant tide in this region chen et al 2003a b also shown in fig 4 and the water depth is small near the coast 20 m or less fig 1c the amplitude of the m4 tide near the coast should not be ignored fig 4e this is because some of the tidal energy is transformed into that of the m4 tide and other shallow water tides such as ms4 it follows that the amplitude of the m2 tide in this region decreases while the amplitudes of the k1 and o1 tides do not change much fig 4a c d resulting in an increase in f this helps to explain why the nearshore waters are dominated by an irregular semidiurnal tide fig 3b shows the distribution of g values with g 0 5 indicating the regular semidiurnal tidal current is dominant and 0 5 g 2 0 implying the irregular semidiurnal tidal current is dominant as can be seen g is generally less than 0 5 in the study domain suggesting that the tidal flow here is mainly regular semidiurnal except for some tiny regions such as the waters to the southeast of taohua island the results presented here are consistent with the conclusions of chen et al 2003c mentioned in section 1 however the study of chen et al 2003c lacks more detailed quantification of spatial distributions for tide and tidal current forms f and g in the zhoushan archipelago because of its coarse model grids 1 8 km vs 0 26 km used in our model further the work was aimed at studying the tidal characteristics in the seas adjacent to zhejiang without much detail on the zhoushan archipelago 3 2 cotidal charts after conducting harmonic analysis on the simulated sea level records at each grid point we drew the cotidal charts for the four major tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 for both the parent domain and the child domain figs 2 and 4a d and two overtides of m2 m4 and m6 tides for the child domain fig 4e f the amplitudes figs 2 and 4 clearly demonstrate that semidiurnal tides are the significant constituents in this study area this is particularly true for the m2 tide which has a much larger amplitude than the other tides the averaged amplitudes of the m2 and s2 tides in the zhoushan archipelago are 1 11 and 0 44 m respectively whereas the amplitudes of the k1 and o1 tides are smaller only about 32 4 and 16 2 of the amplitude of the m2 tide respectively in general when propagating toward the coast tidal amplitudes tend to increase because of the geometrical convergence effects dyer 1973 however a striking feature of the two major semidiurnal tides m2 and s2 see fig 4a b is that their amplitudes decrease remarkably when they propagate into the zhoushan archipelago take the m2 tide for example its amplitude is about 1 3 m to the east of taohua island but decreases to 0 6 m in the luotou channel and then increases again after passing through the channel ren and yang 2008 suggested that this phenomenon is mainly due to the conversion of tidal potential energy to kinetic energy in the channels with a rapid change of cross sectional area the flow speed of the m2 tide in the narrow channels is much larger than that in the surrounding open water fig 5 a which can be explained by the bernoulli effect batchelor 1967 in addition the suddenly greater water depth in the channels disperses the tidal energy distribution and the high tidal energy dissipation due to the complex topography here may also contribute to the changes in the amplitudes of the tides zhang 2007 differently from semidiurnal tides the amplitudes of diurnal tides k1 and o1 basically increase as the tidal waves propagate westward in the zhoushan archipelago fig 4c d this is explained as follows since the zhoushan archipelago is dominated by semidiurnal tides the diurnal tidal current amplitudes are 1 order of magnitude smaller fig 5a d the influence of topographic change on the diurnal tides is relatively small this can be explained by the fact that the wavelength of a diurnal tide is much longer than that of a semidiurnal tide and hence the island has less effect because of refraction of the diurnal tidal waves therefore when diurnal tides enter the channels between islands some of the converged energy caused by the decreased cross sectional area may be converted into tidal potential energy and thereby increase the amplitudes of the two major diurnal tides k1 and o1 the amplitude of the m4 tide is significant in this region and shows an increasing trend when the m4 tide is propagating westward fig 4e the amplitude of the m6 tide is a little smaller than that of the m4 tide fig 4e f in addition its distribution is slightly different from that of the m4 tide with higher amplitude around daishan island fig 4f the generation of these two overtides may be due to advective nonlinear processes resulting from interactions between tidal currents and topography parker 1991 see also the detailed discussion in section 5 on the basis of the co phase lines which qualitatively reflect the direction and speed of tidal wave propagation figs 2 and 4 the general distributions of the phase lags of the s2 and o1 tides are similar to those of the m2 tide and the k1 tide respectively after propagating into the east china sea and approaching the coastal areas of zhejiang province the m2 tidal wave separates into two main branches with one propagating northwestward forming an amphidromic point in the south yellow sea due to the interactions between incoming and reflected waves bao et al 2001 and the other turning to the taiwan strait with another amphidromic point northeast of taiwan island fig 2a part of the northwestward propagating tidal wave enters the zhoushan archipelago and turns to the west figs 2a and 4a as for the m2 tide the s2 tide has similar co phase distributions with values about 30 greater according to the gradient of the co phase we can estimate the wave speed c which can be calculated by c l t where l is the distance between two adjacent co phase lines and t is the time taken by the wave to travel this distance it can be estimated that t g 360 t m2 where g is the phase difference between two adjacent co phase lines and t m2 is the period of the m2 tide obviously the m2 tide propagates faster in the offshore open water areas where l is large fig 2a with an average wave speed of approximately 37 5 m s 1 and more slowly in the zhoushan archipelago owing to a smaller l fig 4a with a mean wave speed of approximately 8 2 m s 1 it can be seen that even though the distributions of the two major diurnal tides k1 and o1 appear very different from those of semidiurnal tides fig 2c d they are all kelvin waves propagating southward along the coast as shown in fig 2c and d there is an amphidromic point for both the k1 tide and the o1 tide around which the two diurnal tides rotate counterclockwise the amphidromic point of the k1 tide is located at 123 2 e 34 n and that of the o1 tide is located at 123 e 33 5 n which are in good agreement with bao et al 2001 in general the cotidal charts presented here have higher spatial resolution than those in previous studies e g chen et al 2003c cheng 2009 li and rong 2012 zhang 2007 3 3 tidal current ellipses the semimajor semiminor axis of a tidal ellipse represents the maximum minimum velocity that the tidal current for the given constituent can reach the ratio of the minimum velocity to the maximum velocity indicates the direction of rotation of the tidal current a positive value indicates that the current will rotate counterclockwise over time otherwise it will rotate clockwise tidal current ellipses for the four major tides m2 s2 k1 o1 and two overtides m4 m6 were computed at each numerical grid point on the basis of model results for the depth averaged tidal current velocity their spatial distributions are shown in fig 5 at every 25 grid points the semidiurnal tidal currents fig 5a b increase in channels and shallow regions which is similar to the conclusions drawn by hatayama et al 1996 and choo and kim 2013 the tidal current ellipse for the two semidiurnal tides demonstrates strong rectilinear flows with the major axis closely following the channel orientation among the islands and shows a flow rotating clockwise with major axes roughly along the southeast northwest direction in open water in the eastern part of the study domain but shows both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations inside hangzhou bay the spatial distribution for tidal ellipses in a channel is similar to spatial distributions found in the canadian arctic archipelago by chen et al 2009 the general patterns of the tidal current ellipses for the m2 and s2 tides are close to their propagation directions mentioned above and are strongly controlled by the local topography whereas coriolis force is also believed to play a role rong and li 2012 the m2 tidal current has a amplitude of 0 35 0 7 m s 1 to the east of the zhoushan islands and about 1 5 3 3 m s 1 in the channels which is much larger than that of the s2 tide and nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of the k1 tide and the o1 tide fig 5c d since this region is dominated by semidiurnal tides the k1 and o1 diurnal tides are remarkably small fig 5c d with an average maximum current speed of only 0 14 and 0 07 m s 1 respectively the distributions of the major diurnal tidal current ellipses share a similar pattern in open water the major axis is oriented in the northeast southwest direction while in shallow waters and channels it is oriented east west which is more pronounced for the k1 tide the rotation direction of the tidal current ellipses of these two diurnal tides is predominantly clockwise north of daishan island but becomes mixed with clockwise and counterclockwise rotations south of daishan island it is striking that the speed of the m4 tidal current can be comparable to or even a little larger than that of the k1 tide in the channels fig 5e c and its average maximum speed is 0 11 m s 1 which is only a little less than that of the k1 tide 0 14 m s 1 such a strong m4 tidal current is attributed to nonlinear processes see the detailed discussion in section 5 the speed of the m6 tidal current is much less than that of the m4 tide fig 5f these two harmonic overtides of the m2 tide can cause significant tidal asymmetry chen et al 2003c xie et al 2012 2013 the generation mechanisms for the m4 and m6 tides are discussed in section 5 3 4 tidal energy flux and dissipation because of the complex topography in the zhoushan archipelago i e thousands of islands and many deep channels fig 1c this region is believed to be an ideal area where the tidal energy can be explored for power generation hou et al 2014 some studies on tidal energy in this region adopted a very coarse model grid owing to their focus on the entire east china coastal waters e g li et al 2005 zhu and liu 2012 it is worth mentioning that our results from the parent domain not shown here are generally consistent with these findings although previous studies e g li et al 2005 zhu and liu 2012 can give us a general understanding of tidal energy propagation and dissipation their focus was on large areas and they lack detailed spatial structure of the propagation and dissipation in the zhoushan archipelago hou et al 2014 estimated tidal current energy in the zhoushan archipelago with a high resolution model but they did not discuss the tidal energy budget in this subsection we present a more detailed discussion on the tidal energy budget in this area the time averaged tidal energy flux and dissipation can be calculated by the following two equations respectively davies and kwong 2000 gill 1982 greenberg 1979 3 e fx e fy ρ t t 0 0 1 u v h g ς u 2 v 2 2 d σ dt 4 d i s 1 t 0 t ρ c d v b 3 d s d t d i s 1 d v d i s 2 d h d i s 3 where efx efy and u v are the eastward and northward components of the tidal energy flux and the depth averaged tidal current velocity vector respectively t is the time interval for computation which we set here to 30 days ρ is the water density g is the acceleration due to gravity h x y is the water depth ς x y t is the tidal elevation dis the tidal energy dissipation which is composed of three terms on the right side of eq 4 where dis1 is the bottom boundary layer dissipation dis2 is the dissipation caused by vertical diffusion and dis3 is the dissipation caused by horizontal diffusion respectively cd is for the bottom friction coefficient and v b is the bottom tidal current vector dis2 and dis3 will not be considered here to calculate the tidal energy dissipation for convenience since their magnitudes are relatively smaller than that of dis1 fig 6 a presents the spatial distribution of the depth integrated energy flux it can be seen that tidal energy entering the zhoushan archipelago may be divided into two parts fig 6c one from the eastern boundary of the study domain that accounts for 73 8 of the total incoming tidal energy flux 7 09 gw and the other from the southern boundary that accounts for the remaining part 2 52 gw some of the incoming tidal energy 2 56 gw exits the area and enters the upper part of hangzhou bay to the western boundary of our model domain fig 6c and some 2 59 gw flows out of the study domain through the northern boundary it is notable that the energy flux is enhanced in channels such as the guanmen channel and the luotou channel where a pronounced increase in flow speed is observed figs 6a and 7 additionally it can be seen that the direction of the tidal energy flux is basically parallel to that of the major axis of semidiurnal tidal current ellipses figs 5a b and 6a and semidiurnal tidal wave propagation fig 4a b indicating that the tidal energy in this region is dominated by the semidiurnal tides the distribution of the tidal energy dissipation rate per unit area only for dis1 is shown in fig 6b as can be seen there are many energy dissipation hotspots in channels or where the tidal current speed is high because of geomorphic constriction zhong and li 2006 in open water east of the study domain the magnitude of energy dissipation is relatively small and basically ranges from 0 01 to 0 1 w m 2 however in channels and shallow water regions the dissipation is enhanced especially in narrow channels where the values are generally higher than 1 w m 2 and even larger than 10 w m 2 in places as expected this distribution of energy dissipation is consistent with that of the current speed figs 6b and 7 this is not surprising because dis1 is determined mainly by current speed given that only dis1 is considered the actual total dissipated energy is greater than that estimated here a simple tidal energy budget can be given on the basis of fig 6c the total incoming energy is 9 61 gw 7 09 gw 2 52 gw with 5 15 gw 2 56 gw 2 59 gw being transported out of the domain and 3 0 gw dissipating because of the bottom friction inside the study area fig 6c as a result the residual energy 1 46 gw is dissipated because of the terms dis2 and dis3 in addition the eddies generated around the islands fig 8 may also consume some of the tidal energy which is worthy of further study 4 discussion of the mechanism of tidal currents 4 1 simulated tidal current the simulated depth and time averaged tidal current vector fields during flood and ebb are shown in fig 7 the flow speed is generally enhanced in the channels and shallow water regions the mean current speed during ebb can reach 2 5 m s 1 during spring tide in narrow channels such as the xiazhimen channel fig 7b the simulated maximum current speed 4 67 m s 1 in the xiazhimen channel is slightly greater than that observed 4 0 m s 1 e g chen et al 2003b feng et al 1999 this discrepancy is probably due to the small bottom drag coefficient 0 00067 used for the simulation except for this difference our model results are generally consistent with the observed values chen et al 2003b one of the remarkable features is that flood ebb asymmetry can be found in the tidal current the mean flow speed of ebb tide is slightly greater than that of flood tide fig 7 which is in agreement with xie et al 2012 2013 who claimed that there is ebb dominance in the southern part of hangzhou bay on the basis of their model results the tidal asymmetry is pronounced in some channels such as the guishan hangmen channel where the maximum flow speed is approximately 4 49 m s 1 during ebb but approximately 3 68 m s 1 during flood at one certain location 4 2 jetlike flows jetlike flow across channels is one of the typical features shown in model results e g ding 2008 feng 2012 and in observations ren and yang 2008 however there is a lack of study of fine spatial structures and relevant dynamics for simplicity here we choose only two typical channels for discussion the guishan hangmen channel and the guanmen channel see the red box in fig 7 and fig 1c for their locations during ebb the averaged tidal current is seen to flow out through the bay s mouth when it passes through the channels in the zhoushan archipelago the velocity increases markedly and intense jetlike flows are formed especially in these two channels with a maximum average speed above 2 0 m s 1 figs 7b and 8b during flood however this feature jetlike flows is not as significant as during ebb when the flood current confronts the guishan hangmen channel part of it turns around and forms a counterclockwise eddy which should consume some tidal energy and reduce the strength of jetlike flow thus the existence of numerous islands of various sizes may impede flood current but may have a small impact on ebb current which gives rise to the ebb dominant tide here because of the jetlike flow a strong velocity shear appears in the cross channel direction fig 8a b such a large horizontal tidal current shear produces negative anticyclonic and positive cyclonic vorticities respectively on the left and right sides of the island facing downstream fig 8c d the high values of the surface vorticity normalized by the coriolis frequency f adjacent to the islands fig 8c d indicate that the flows are highly nonlinear in nature some interesting questions arise regarding the jetlike flow for example what is its width how deep it is to answer these questions the guishan hangmen channel is selected fig 9 during ebb a clear jet can be seen in the middle of the channel fig 9b with a flow speed of approximately 3 8 m s 1 and a horizontal width of approximately 570 m reaching a depth of approximately 6 5 m in addition the velocity field shows strong horizontal and vertical shears 4 3 tidally averaged momentum balance to gain insight into the dynamics in the channels here we follow hench and luettich 2003 to estimate the contribution of each term in the x and y momentum equations on the basis of the model output and the following two equations 5 u t u u x v u y f v 1 ρ p x υ δ u c d u 2 v 2 h u 0 6 v t u v x v v y f u 1 ρ p y υ δ v c d u 2 v 2 h v 0 acc hadv cor pre visc bstr where f is the coriolis parameter p is the pressure υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient δ 2 x 2 2 y 2 is the horizontal diffusion operator and h x y t h x y ς x y t is the total water depth acc hadv cor pre visc and bstr stand for the local acceleration horizontal nonlinear advection coriolis force pressure gradient turbulent viscosity and bottom friction terms respectively figs 10 and 11 show the spatial distributions of average values of five terms hadv pre acc cor and bstr during one flood and ebb period respectively the visc term is not presented because of its very small magnitude in comparison with other five terms during both flood and ebb the hadv and pre terms are dominant terms being at least 1 order of magnitude greater than the other three balancing the momentum with a generally opposite relationship of their spatial distributions figs 10a d and 11a d it is worth noting that the spatial distributions of the hadv and pre terms are basically consistent during flood and ebb periods respectively with positive and negative values interlaced around the islands on the basis of this state we can speculate that the islands can cause great fluctuations in the tidal current and water level around them and this effect will decrease as we move away from the islands furthermore the spatial distributions of the current and water level fluctuation are also similar during flood and ebb respectively which causes the water levels in some locations near the islands to be usually lower or higher than those of their surrounding waters the bernoulli effect may be used to explain this phenomenon the pressure in the location where the current speed is high is low and causes a low water level in addition the eddies generated by the variation of water depth may be another reason limited by the islands coastlines the tidal current here leads to more x direction component which accounts for the slightly higher values of the acc and bstr terms in the x direction and of the cor term in the y direction for better accuracy we choose six representative stations a1 a2 a3 a4 b1 and b2 fig 10j for analysis among them a1 a2 a3 and a4 help describe the tidal dynamics in the narrow channels while b1 and b2 help demonstrate the tidal dynamics of surrounding waters instead of averaging over one flood or ebb period as shown in figs 10 and 11 here we average the absolute values of each term over one tidal period the results in the x and y directions are listed in tables 2 and 3 absolute values are used in the calculations to reduce the effect of residual current so that we can focus on the momentum balance caused mainly by tides as demonstrated in the spatial distributions figs 10 and 11 the momentum balance at the six points is primarily between the hadv term and the pre term which is most prominent in the channels a1 a2 a3 and a4 for station a1 since the tidal current is mainly in the x direction the significant terms hadv 91 18 10 5 m s2 and pre 101 11 10 5 m s2 are about 3 6 and 5 5 orders of magnitude greater than the corresponding two terms in the y momentum equation table 3 suggesting a predominant bernoulli type balance in the x direction however at station a2 where the tidal current mainly runs in the y direction the result is the opposite the values of the hadv and pre terms in the y direction are much higher than those in the x direction similarly the current at station a3 or station a4 is directed roughly northeast southwest or southeast northwest producing comparable values of the hadv and pre terms in the x and y directions for these stations a1 a2 a3 and a4 in the x direction the acc term plays a secondary role in the balance followed by the bstr and cor terms in that order in the y direction the cor term becomes greater to be comparable to or larger than the acc term in both the x direction and the y direction the visc term has the smallest magnitude and this is why it is not shown in figs 10 and 11 at stations b1 and b2 away from the channels the magnitudes of all five terms decrease with the most significant reduction in the hadv and pre terms in the x direction the hadv term becomes smaller than the acc term and the pre term is only a little larger than the acc term which means that the hadv term is no longer as important as it in the channels the same situation occurs in the y direction but with a much smaller acc term as the consequence of the nearly west east flow at these two stations comparing the results for the six stations and also taking previous analysis into consideration we conclude that the islands have a significant impact on the tidal current and water level in this region leading to jetlike flows and higher nonlinearity in the channels therefore it is of great interest to further study the influence of islands and complex topographies on tides according to our findings and those of studies in other regions e g hatayama et al 1996 hench and luettich 2003 sheng and wang 2004 choo and kim 2013 it is evident that there is strong nonlinearity in the flow because of strong geometric and topographic gradients and the horizontal advection is dominant in the momentum balance 5 sensitivity studies on shallow water tides the shallow water tidal constituents generated in coastal waters are of great importance to the tidal wave morphology and tidal asymmetry huang et al 2008 li and dong 2013 song et al 2016 the strong overtides of m2 were reported years ago in this region e g chen et al 2003a b c however their generation mechanisms have never been explored in this section we report a sensitivity study with six numerical experiments to discuss the generation mechanisms for the m4 and m6 overtides table 4 generated by nonlinearity the results from the control run were extensively discussed in the preceding sections here we discuss only the sensitivity test results to quantitatively describe the variations in the sensitivity test results with reference to the control run result the relative variation ratio rvr is defined as follows 7 r v r e t s e t c e t c 100 where the subscripts s and c represent the sensitivity test result and the control run result respectively and 8 e t i 1 m s a l i 2 s a s i 2 where m is the total model grids i is the model grid point sal is the semimajor axis of the tidal ellipse and sas is the semiminor axis of the tidal ellipse the rvr and et values are listed in table 5 in case 1 we replace the quadratic bottom friction used in the control run with linear bottom friction in comparison with the control run fig 5e f the variation in the m4 tidal ellipse is not significant fig 12 a and only a small increase in the current speed occurred somewhere with rvr of 7 34 for the m6 tide fig 12b the change is much smaller with rvr of 0 71 hence nonlinear processes from the bottom friction term are not the dominant factor in generating the m4 and m6 tides in case 2 without the nonlinear advection term in the horizontal momentum equations some striking differences are observed fig 12c d in contrast to the control run for example the m4 and m6 tidal current speeds decrease significantly especially in some narrow channels and the average size of the ellipses is reduced dramatically rvr for the m4 and m6 tides is 54 56 and 49 82 respectively indicating that the current speed is decreased by half compared with that in the control run therefore it is evident that the nonlinear advection term plays a critical role in generating the m4 tide and the m6 tide and the effect of nonlinear bottom friction is negligible for the m4 tide our sensitivity test results are consistent with the results of previous studies e g pingree and maddock 1978 sheng and wang 2004 while for the m6 tide the present results are different from previous results outside the zhoushan archipelago e g fang 1987 parker 1991 sheng and wang 2004 in which quadratic bottom friction plays an important role in generating the m6 tide we attribute this discrepancy to the following two possible reasons 1 according to eq 13 in zhu et al 2016 the flow speed of the m6 tide is proportional to the bottom drag coefficient cd therefore because of the small cd 0 00067 compared with a standard value of 0 0025 the bottom friction effect is small in the first place and thus the difference between linear and nonlinear bottom frictions is also very limited 2 owing to the study domain having numerous channels the main dynamic balance is between the horizontal advection term hadv and the pressure gradient force term pre as shown in tables 2 and 3 the bottom friction term bstr is nearly 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the hadv term and hence the variations between results from linear and quadratic bottom frictions are much smaller compared with the hadv term to examine whether the forcing exerted by shallow water tides at the open boundaries has a role in generating the m4 and m6 tides inside our model domain we reran the model without the shallow water tidal constituents m4 ms4 mn4 at the open boundaries case 3 as shown in figs 12e and 12f the m4 and m6 current ellipses obtained show changes in their size to some degree compared with those of the control run fig 5e f with rvr of 12 41 and 2 60 for the m4 tide and the m6 tide respectively which implies that the two overtides considered here are mainly produced locally it is interesting to check whether the forcing provided by the m2 tide alone at the open boundaries can produce strong m4 and m6 tidal currents inside the study domain for that purpose we reran the model with only the m2 tide at the open boundaries case 4 in contrast to the control run it is surprising that the m6 tidal current speed increased significantly at almost all grid points especially in the channels with rvr of 86 20 fig 12g h the maximum speed of the m6 tide increases from 0 34 m s 1 in the control run to 0 6 m s 1 in this case for the m4 tide the speed increase is much smaller with rvr of 18 15 however after addition of the s2 tide forcing at the open boundaries based on case 4 case 5 the sizes of the m4 and m6 tidal current ellipses fig 12i j are generally smaller than in case 4 with rvr of 19 90 and 41 55 for the m4 tide and the m6 tide respectively this demonstrates that the s2 tide has a negative effect on the generation of the m4 and m6 tides perhaps due to the nonlinear interactions between m2 and s2 tides that generate other compound tides such as ms4 and ms6 and thus a reduction of energy conversion to the m4 and m6 tidal constituents through a nonlinear effect just like kowalik and proshutinsky 1993 supposed that the possible interaction between m2 and diurnal tides may lead to damping of the diurnal tides in the final experiment we exclude the m2 tide forcing at the open boundaries case 6 the sizes of the m4 and m6 tidal current ellipses both decrease remarkably in this case fig 12k l with rvr of 70 45 and 79 58 for the m4 tide and the m6 tide respectively on the basis of the results of these six experiments we conclude that the dominant generation mechanisms for m4 and m6 tides are the advection of momentum and interactions in channels and shallow waters with the primary forcing from the m2 tide at the boundary while the nonlinear effect from the bottom friction makes only a small contribution to overtide production the generation of compound tides and overtides is commonly believed to be attributed to an inherently nonlinear condition in shallow water regions dronkers 1964 the strength of the shallow water tides depends on the fundamental tidal constituent s aubrey and speer 1985 huang and huang 2005 since m2 is the most pronounced tidal constituent in this region it is natural that m4 is the most energetic shallow water tide parker 1991 zhu et al 2016 6 summary in this study a high resolution 260 m three dimensional numerical model roms was applied to study the barotropic tide tidal current and associated dynamic mechanisms in the zhoushan archipelago the simulated harmonic constants and cotidal charts agree well with the observations the model was validated by comparison with previous results in general the simulated tidal ellipses and cotidal charts presented here have higher spatial resolution than in previous studies e g chen et al 2003c cheng 2009 li and rong 2012 zhang 2007 the features of the simulated cotidal chart for the barotropic tide in the parent domain can be interpreted as a result of kelvin waves which have the highest amplitude near the shore and decay exponentially offshore leblond and mysak 1978 the tidal type in the zhoushan archipelago is generally characterized by an irregular semidiurnal tide in the island concentrated regions but a regular semidiurnal tide away from the islands the tidal currents are mainly regular semidiurnal in this region the m2 tide is dominant delineating the basic tidal dynamic features in the study domain propagating toward the west northwest with the amplitude significantly decreasing in channels and shallow water regions the distributions of phase lag and amplitude for the s2 tide are similar to those of the m2 tide while the mean amplitude is only two fifths of that of the m2 tide the k1 and o1 tides are two major diurnal components sharing similar distribution patterns of amplitude and phase lag with the amplitude of k1 being greater than that of o1 it is striking that the amplitudes of these two diurnal tides show increasing trends toward the western part of the study domain in short the m2 tide is dominant followed by the s2 k1 and o1 tides in that order the spatial distribution of tidal ellipses for the m2 and s2 tides shares a common pattern in that the orientation of the major axis generally aligns with a channel between islands exhibiting a rectilinear flow while in open water the flow shows somewhat rotational features the tidal ellipses for the k1 and o1 tides have a similar spatial distribution while their sizes are small compared with those of the m2 tide the barotropic tidal energy budget in the zhoushan archipelago was also evaluated the total incoming energy is 9 61 gw with 5 15 gw flowing out of the study area and 3 0 gw dissipated due to bottom friction inside the study area fig 6c as a result the residual energy 1 46 gw is dissipated by horizontal and vertical diffusions in addition the eddies generated around the islands may also consume some of the tidal energy there are many energy dissipation hotspots in the channels where the tidal current speed is high a jetlike flow in a channel is one of the most remarkable features such as the flow in the guishan hangmen channel whose width can occupy the most of the channel and the depth of the main part can almost reach the seafloor although there have been many studies on tides along the zhejiang coast or in the zhoushan archipelago an analysis of the dynamic mechanism was lacking in this work dynamic balance analysis of tidal currents was performed for a small region containing the guishan hangmen channel and the guanmen channel and also for six points inside this region it was found that the primary balance near the islands is between the horizontal advection term hadv and the pressure gradient force pre suggesting a predominant bernoulli type tidal motion with strong nonlinearity caused by the complex topography at a distance from the islands however the values of the hadv and pre terms become very small with magnitude comparable to that of the acc term which means that the nonlinearity of the tidal current here is no longer as important as it in the channels furthermore among the islands there are many low or high value centers of water level throughout the entire tidal cycle the bernoulli effect and variation of water depth may be used to explain this thus the islands have an important effect on the tidal current and water level generating jetlike flows in the channels and making the tides more nonlinear the strong overtides of m2 were reported years ago in this region e g chen et al 2003a b c however their generation mechanisms had never been explored to find out the generation mechanism for the m4 and m6 tides we conducted six sensitivity experiments the results demonstrate that the m4 and m6 tides are mainly generated by nonlinear advection and the bottom friction plays a minor role different tidal forcing conditions at the open boundaries have different effects on the generation of shallow water tides the m4 and m6 tides are generally produced locally by nonlinear processes as the m2 tide propagates to shallow water areas rather than propagating into the area from the open boundary also we find that the s2 tide may have a negative effect on the generation of the m4 and m6 tides acknowledgments we thank four anonymous reviewers and an editor for their insightful comments and suggestions this study was jointly supported by the national key r d
