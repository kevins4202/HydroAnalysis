16070,the global oceans are known as terminal sink or secondary source for diffusive emission of organochlorine pesticides ocps and selected current used pesticides cups into the overlaying atmosphere many pesticides have been widely produced worldwide subsequently applied and released into the environment however information on the occurrence patterns spatial variability and air seawater exchange of pesticides is limited to easily accessible regions and hence only few studies are reported from the remote southern ocean to fill this information gap a large scale ship based sampling campaign was conducted in the samples from this campaign we measured concentrations of 221 pesticides both gaseous and aqueous samples were collected along a sampling transect from the western pacific to the southern ocean 19 75 n 76 16 s from november 2018 to march 2019 twenty seven individual pesticides were frequently 50 detected in gaseous and aqueous samples tebuconazole diphenylamine myclobutanil and hexachlorobenzene hcb dominated the composition profile in both phases spatial trends analysis in atmospheric and seawater concentrations showed a substantial level reduction from the western pacific towards the southern ocean back trajectory analysis showed that atmospheric pesticide concentrations were strongly influenced by air masses origins continental and riverine inputs are important sources of pesticides in the western pacific and indian oceans atmospheric and seawater concentrations for the target pesticide residues in the southern ocean are low and evenly distributed due to the large distance from potential pollution sources as well as the effective isolation by the antarctic convergence ac air seawater fugacity ratios and fluxes indicated that the western pacific and indian oceans were secondary sources for most pesticides emitted to the atmosphere while the southern ocean was still considered to be a sink graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pesticides southern ocean source characterization air seawater exchange 1 introduction pesticides are a class of many thousands of synthetic chemicals that have been widely produced since the 1940s for diverse agriculture and public health related applications carrizo et al 2017 rani et al 2021 turusov et al 2002 long term exposure to pesticides is often related to a variety of health effects like carcinogenesis respiratory diseases endocrine disruption and neurological disorders rani et al 2021 turusov et al 2002 pesticides in the marine environment are stemming mainly from land based sources such as agricultural areas and densely populated regions considerable work has been done in the past to study the environmental fate of pesticides especially focusing on the profile and level of background terrestrial and freshwater locations ruge et al 2018 wang et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2017 providing valuable information regarding for emission sources and long range atmospheric transport lrat of pesticides as pesticides are used in agricultural fields they can volatilize into air or be released into freshwater and then transported to remote area through long range atmospheric or ocean transport choi et al 2008 potapowicz et al 2020 weber et al 2006 wu et al 2020 ya et al 2019 the ocean plays an important role in global transport and distribution as a carrying medium storage tank and secondary emission source bigot et al 2016 carrizo et al 2017 these direct and indirect discharge processes in combination with environmental stability of some pesticides ultimately result in a compound specific dispersal profile into the marine environment bigot et al 2016 carrizo et al 2017 ya et al 2019 the global distribution and transport routes of pesticides have been discussed for decades jantunen and bidleman 1995 weber et al 2006 however the long term effects of pesticides on pelagic biogeochemical cycles are still poorly understood measurements of pesticides in the ocean atmosphere and seawater are thus needed to gain insight into the pesticides transport and distribution in the highly dynamic marine environment land masses in the northern hemisphere have been identified as main source of persistent organic pollutants pops gioia et al 2012 wu et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 the oceans especially in the southern hemisphere function more or less as a dilution and equilibration space for the northern hemisphere overspills schreitmueller and ballschmiter 1995 the occurrence of pesticides in the northern hemisphere marine environment has been widely reported with a particular focus on levels and trends in the atmosphere and seawater bidleman et al 2007 galbán malagón et al 2013a gioia et al 2012 huang et al 2013 wu et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 zhong et al 2012 while less information is available on the spatial variability of pesticides in the southern ocean bigot et al 2016 galbán malagón et al 2013c these reported studies have markedly enhanced our knowledge on pesticide behavior in the marine environment especially in the northern hemisphere however pesticide dynamics at the multi compartment level in the southern hemisphere covering large geographic ocean regions remain relatively unexplored according more knowledge on their fate in the southern hemisphere marine environment is needed to provide insight into the biogeochemical processes compound specific mobility and temporal variability of pesticides in the global ocean anthropogenic pollutants including persistent pesticides are transported from the continental shelves into the open oceans subsequently they are further transported via poleward directed ocean currents zhang et al 2019 synchronously dynamic exchange of pesticides occurs at the air seawater interface biological pumps have the potential to remove pesticides from the atmosphere through air seawater exchange and by subsequently settling particles into deep water bodies carrizo et al 2017 galbán malagón et al 2012 jurado et al 2004 air seawater exchange is therefore an important supporting process that controls the inter compartmental migration residence time and ultimately the environmental fate of persistent pesticides in the marine environment dachs et al 2002 ding et al 2007 jantunen et al 2008 2015 comprehensive earlier studies mainly focused on the arctic pacific basin have largely enhanced our understanding of pesticide transport pathways and fate on large spatial and temporal scales jantunen et al 2015 pućko et al 2012 ya et al 2019 zhong et al 2012 however these studies were largely focused on halogenated and persistent organic pesticides the large group of current used pesticides cups largely remain unexplored in addition few pesticide assessments are currently available to date on the antarctica and the adjacent southern ocean bigot et al 2016 2017 choi et al 2008 dickhut et al 2005 galbán malagón et al 2013b jantunen et al 2004 the sampling in this study provides a unique opportunity to measure air seawater exchange and to determine whether gaseous pesticides are deposited to the surface seawater of the southern ocean gaseous and aqueous samples were sampled during an antarctic expedition in 2018 2019 chinare 35 for studying the role of ocean as medium for distribution and carrier of pesticide residues by analyzing pesticides in the samples we aim to elucidate the presence land ocean interactions and distribution patterns of pesticides along the transect from the western pacific to the southern ocean 179 29 177 48 e 76 16 19 75 n the specific objectives of this study were to better understand 1 the overall concentration and geographical distribution of pesticides in gaseous and aqueous samples from the western pacific to the southern ocean and their environmental implications 2 the importance of continental inputs on the occurrence of pesticides in the marine environment and 3 the direction of air seawater exchange 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection aqueous and gaseous phase samples from the western pacific to the southern ocean were collected during chinare 35 between november 2018 and march 2019 the detailed cruise route is depicted in fig 1 and tables s1 and s2 in the supporting information si air samples were collected using a high volume solid phase extraction hv spe sampler text s1 equipped with a glass fiber filter gff 0 7 µm cut off whatman 142 mm diameter to collect the particulate phase followed by a column filled with pre cleaned xad 2 resin sigma amberlite 20 60 mesh 42 g to

the sample extracts were analyzed for 221 pesticides using an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph coupled to a 7010b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer gc ms ms agilent palo alto ca usa details of the instrumental analysis are provided in the si a complete list of analytes can be found in tables s3 and s4 2 3 quality assurance and quality control all materials used for sampling were thoroughly cleaned and suitably stored text s1 field blank levels were 10 for all samples and not blank corrected was performed zhang et al 2017 the method detection limits mdls were calculated as equal to the blank plus the concentration corresponding to a signal to noise ratio of 3 zhang et al 2019 concentrations below the mdls were replaced by the mdl value divided by the square root of 2 the mdls were estimated to 0 002 38 pg m3 gaseous and 0 003 76 pg l aqueous tables s3 and s4 generally 27 pesticides were frequently detected in gaseous and aqueous samples with most compounds were not detectable or below mdl therefore were not considered for statistical data interpretation the recoveries of heptachlor epoxide isomer b in gas and seawater ranged from 44 to 128 mean 77 and 42 to 127 mean 66 respectively the median recoveries of individual pesticides in spiked samples ranged from 52 to 110 in air samples and 43 to 136 in seawater samples table s5 the final concentration of pesticides was recovered but not blank corrected detailed descriptions of the sampling qa qc are described in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 pesticide detection and concentrations in air and seawater of the 221 target pesticides analyzed 24 were identified in more than 50 of the gaseous samples and 25 were identified in more than 70 of the aqueous samples and the following discussion will focus only on these pesticides the detection frequency and concentration of pesticides across the sampling regions are summarized in table s5 figs s1 and s2 propoxur hexachlorobenzene hcb acetochlor dicofol triadimefon penconazole tebuconazole epoxiconazole chloroneb diphenylamine myclobutanil pentachloronitrobenzene tetraconazole o p dde α hch β hch γ hch p p dde and propiconazole were detected in 80 of the gaseous and aqueous samples oxadiazon hexazinone and fenarimol were detected at 50 in both phases p p ddt and fluquinconazole were detected only in gaseous samples while dicloran fipronil and methidathion were detected only in aqueous samples table s5 it should be mentioned that hcb has historically been widely used as a fungicide but is currently mainly an intermediate product and by product of the production of some chlorinated compounds ya et al 2019 current hcb comes from primary emissions e g by products of chlorinated chemicals and incineration combustion processes and secondary emissions e g re emissions from soil sediment and water liu et al 2009 su et al 2006 the most abundant pesticides in air and seawater were tebuconazole range 39 170 pg m3 53 430 pg l diphenylamine range 8 0 190 pg m3 64 530 pg l hcb range 1 9 95 pg m3 3 7 30 pg l and myclobutanil range 7 4 64 pg m3 3 8 240 pg l fig 2 the low abundance of p p dde relative to p p ddt is usually associated with a fresh source of ddt in the atmosphere shen et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 the p p ddt p p dde usually lower than 1 suggesting the absence of recent ddt sources in the sampled regions similar phenomenon were found in the arctic ecosystems cabrerizo et al 2019 carrizo et al 2017 lohmann et al 2009 the detection of pesticides in remote oceans reinforces its classification as a global contaminant galbán malagón et al 2013c meanwhile the presence of pesticides in the southern ocean suggests that these pops are continuing the lrat ocean currents transport and depositing into remote ecosystems the observed air concentrations of α hch 0 18 1 7 pg m3 β hch 0 16 2 5 pg m3 γ hch 0 18 1 3 pg m3 p p dde 0 12 2 7 pg m3 and o p dde 0 062 0 84 pg m3 in the western pacific and indian oceans were almost one magnitude lower than those reported over the indian ocean in 2004 wurl et al 2006 the andaman sea and bay of bengal and chinese marginal seas in 2008 gioia et al 2012 and one or two magnitudes lower than those measured in the eastern indian and northern pacific oceans three decades ago iwata et al 1993 the median seawater concentration of α hch 1 8 pg l β hch 5 6 pg l and γ hch 3 1 pg l in the western pacific and indian oceans were comparable to those reported in the equatorial indian ocean huang et al 2013 and were lower than those reported in the bohai and yellow seas china zhong et al 2014 the north atlantic and arctic oceans lohmann et al 2009 wong et al 2011 owing to the phase out of technical hch the atmospheric levels of α hch 0 081 0 81 pg m3 β hch 0 079 2 4 pg m3 γ hch 0 081 0 96 pg m3 and hcb 1 9 36 pg m3 over the southern ocean are comparable to previous studies cincinelli et al 2009 galbán malagón et al 2013b jantunen et al 2004 xie et al 2011 the concentrations of α hch β hch γ hch p p dde o p dde and hcb in the southern ocean ranged from 0 52 to 2 3 0 83 to 5 7 0 96 to 3 8 0 28 to 1 4 0 092 to 1 58 and 3 7 to 22 pg l respectively the concentrations of α hch and γ hch were about an order of magnitude lower than those reported in the southern ocean two decades ago iwata et al 1993 jantunen et al 2004 however our results for hcb γ hch β hch p p dde and o p dde are similar to those of the antarctic peninsula galbán malagón et al 2013c the southern ocean between australia and antarctica bigot et al 2016 and the atlantic indian sector of the southern ocean xie et al 2011 demonstrating that the deposition volatilization and transport of these pesticides in the southern ocean may have stabilized bigot et al 2016 3 2 spatial distribution and influencing factors decreasing spatial trends in atmospheric concentrations from the western pacific high to the southern ocean low were found for propoxur hcb acetochlor dicofol triadimefon diphenylamine oxadiazon chloroneb p p ddt p p dde o p dde α hch β hch and pentachloronitrobenzene in addition to triadimefon hexazinone tebuconazole myclobutanil and fluquinconazole significantly higher concentrations of other pesticides were observed at sites a3 a4 a5 a33 a34 a35 and a36 in the western pacific ocean mann whitney test p 0 05 which were influenced by air masses containing air from southeastern australia southeast asia and mainland china fig s3s3 where extensive agricultural activities and thus pesticide uses occur lin et al 2015 ya et al 2019 zhong et al 2012 this is consistent with the high concentrations of organochlorine pesticides ocps measured in these areas lin et al 2015 ya et al 2019 except for hexazinone and epoxiconazole other pesticide concentrations over the southern ocean 60 77º s did not show any significant variations with latitudes spearman correlation p 0 05 similar to that observed for σhchs chlorpyrifos and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons over the southern ocean bigot et al 2016 cabrerizo et al 2014 the southern ocean is far from emission sources and pollutants over the southern ocean are driven primarily by volatilization from soil snow and ice lrat air seawater exchange atmospheric deposition and biological pumps bengtson nash et al 2017 bigot et al 2016 2017 cabrerizo et al 2019 galbán malagón et al 2013c luek et al 2017 in addition the air mass over the southern ocean is thought to be a mixture of clean oceanic and antarctic continental air masses resulting in low and uniformly distributed concentrations in the southern ocean atmosphere cabrerizo et al 2014 latitudinal trends in pesticide concentrations in seawater were also found the concentrations of all pesticides decreased linearly from north to south r2 0 096 to 0 47 p 0 05 figs 3 and s4 sites with high pesticide concentrations in the pacific ocean are adjacent to densely populated continents that host diverse pesticide use lin et al 2015 ya et al 2019 zhong et al 2012 in contrast lower pesticide concentrations in the southern ocean confirm their remoteness to potential sources significantly higher pesticide concentrations were found in the coastal regions of the western pacific and indian oceans samples w1 14 w61 71 mann whitney test p 0 01 significantly higher concentrations of pops have been reported in coastal seawater than in the open sea with sources have been identified as terrestrial sources mainly through continental discharges gonzález gaya et al 2016 zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 the variation of pesticide concentrations was investigated in the vicinity of the coastline of the pacific and indian oceans to understand the impacts of continental discharges except for propoxur fipronil and hcb the other pesticides showed a significant linear decreasing trend with increasing distance from the coastline r2 0 098 to 0 31 p 0 05 fig s5 furthermore a significant inverse correlation was detected between salinity and concentrations of diphenylamine and methidathion rs 0 44 p 0 05 implying a possible riverine influence zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 correlations between individual pesticides and distance and salinity in coastal seawater reflect the effects of continental discharges and continuous riverine inputs on pesticide concentrations similarly lin et al 2015 found that in the coastal areas of the east china sea ocps concentrations displayed an increasing trend close to the coast zhang et al 2019 found a significant inverse correlation between salinity and concentrations of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances in the western atlantic margin explaining the continental emissions as a major source of seawater elevated pesticide concentrations were observed at sites 10 and 11 along the east coast of australia an area influenced by the east australian current eac the eac is a boundary current flowing southward along the east coast of australia severely but comparatively steadily impinging on the continental shelf and slope the accumulation of continental discharges under the role of eac as mentioned above could account for the high pesticide concentrations the antarctic convergence ac is a barrier where cold antarctic seawater flowing northward sinks beneath relatively warm water from lower latitudes and can control the fate of pesticides bigot et al 2016 the concentrations of the pesticides except for myclobutanil hcb propiconazole o p dde tetraconazole and pentachloronitrobenzene were significantly higher in the north of the ac than in the south mann whitney test p 0 01 demonstrating that the north south transfer of pesticides may be hindered by the ac as has been studied in the literature for β hch heptachlor epoxide b and perfluorinated contaminants bengtson nash et al 2010 bigot et al 2016 the large distance to emission sources and the obstruction of ac further confirms the lower characteristics of pesticide concentrations in the southern ocean 3 3 air seawater exchange air seawater exchange is an important process in the migration and diffusion of pesticides in the marine environment to understand the equilibrium of the air seawater exchange the fugacity ratio fa fw was calculated the uncertainty of the fugacity ratio calculated from the pesticide concentration in gas and seawater temperature and henry s law constant is 58 in the sampling region a fa fw 3 8 1 and 0 26 denotes net deposition equilibrium and net volatilization respectively and 0 26 fa fw 3 8 was treated as not significantly different from the air seawater equilibrium the calculation of fa fw air seawater exchange fluxes faw ng m2 d and associated error propagations are shown in text s2 fugacity ratios are depicted in figs 4 and s6 for pesticides with detection frequencies above 90 to reduce error propagations the fugacity ratio was lower than 0 26 for hcb in 62 of the samples indicating a significant net volatilization from seawater to air significant net deposition fa fw 3 8 was observed for β hch in 80 of the samples and for γ hch in 55 of the samples chloroneb diphenylamine pentachloronitrobenzene p p dde o p dde and α hch had fugacity ratios that were not significantly different from equilibrium in 53 84 of the samples hch and p p dde were reported to be in near equilibrium between air and water in the lakes of melville island and barrow strait tending to volatilize in the summer and deposit in the winter cabrerizo et al 2019 the behavior of acetochlor dicofol penconazole tebuconazole and propoxur was far away from the air seawater equilibrium showing a significant net deposition in all regions net deposition of dicofol has been reported over a transect from the east asian sea to the arctic ocean zhong et al 2012 and the bohai and yellow seas china zhong et al 2014 although atmospheric concentrations of some ocps have decreased over the past decades bigot et al 2016 no significant level changes in dicofol have been reported in remote subpolar or polar regions li et al 2015 suggesting that it is being continuously emitted into the environment the log fa fw of α hch was significantly correlated with other pesticides r2 0 60 0 90 p 0 01 fig 4 moreover this cross correlation was also widespread among the 14 pesticides suggesting that similar transport trends and or proportional fugacity ratios of different pesticides pesticides exhibited different atmosphere sea surface partitioning directions in the different sampling regions in the western pacific and indian oceans significant net volatilization was observed for hcb chloroneb and pentachloronitrobenzene in most samples 59 100 indicating that seawater continues to be a source of these pesticides into the atmosphere in contrast no pesticides exhibited net volatilization in the southern ocean diphenylamine α hch β hch γ hch acetochlor dicofol penconazole tebuconazole and propoxur showed fa fw 3 8 in most samples 77 100 suggesting that the predominant process for these pesticides was deposition from the atmosphere to seawater the remaining pesticides are in the range of the equilibrium window this implies that atmospheric pesticides are still a source to the seawater in the southern ocean the possible reason is that the transport of volatile pesticides from seawater to the atmosphere is limited by the significantly lower seawater temperature in the southern ocean than in the western pacific and indian oceans mann whitney test p 0 01 higher temperatures facilitate the transport of pops from the water column to the atmosphere mainly for legacy pops whose concentration in the atmosphere have ended and whose lifetimes in seawater are much higher than that in the atmosphere cabrerizo et al 2019 ma et al 2018 different patterns were observed in the magnitude and direction of pesticide air seawater fluxes from the western pacific to the southern ocean figs 5 and s7 at all sampling sites average deposition fluxes were dominated by five pesticides acetochlor 370 to 6 0 ng m2 day dicofol 420 to 10 ng m2 day penconazole 990 to 78 ng m2 day tebuconazole 5300 to 1000 ng m2 day and propoxur 98 to 2 ng m2 day with net deposition significantly different mann whitney test p 0 05 from equilibrium as defined above in the western pacific and indian oceans the greatest net volatilization fluxes were always observed for hcb chloroneb and pentachloronitrobenzene with median values were 22 ng m2 day 1 4 ng m2 day and 2 8 ng m2 day in the western pacific ocean and 6 3 ng m2 day 1 2 ng m2 day and 0 99 ng m2 day in the indian ocean respectively p p dde 0 60 ng m2 day o p dde 0 14 ng m2 day α hch 0 84 ng m2 day and γ hch 0 97 ng m2 day in the western pacific ocean and p p dde 0 49 ng m2 day o p dde 0 099 ng m2 day in the indian ocean showed the statistical equilibrium 0 26 fa fw 3 8 but those pesticides still showed a tendency to volatilize at higher fluxes net volatilization fluxes were observed in the western pacific and indian oceans indicating that riverine inputs and continental discharges were more significant sources of dissolved pesticides than atmospheric deposition liu et al 2016 similar volatilization or near equilibrium conditions fluxes of p p dde γ hch and α hch were also observed in the east china sea lin et al 2015 and the equatorial indian ocean huang et al 2013 restriction or prohibition of primary releases of hch and ddt in most parts of the world lin et al 2015 and degradation leading to lower environmental concentrations the ocean can act as a buffer accumulating pesticides during periods of high emissions while the atmosphere responds more quickly to reduced emissions resulting in low air seawater fugacity ratios zhang and lohmann 2010 in the oligotrophic pacific and indian oceans the downward loss of pesticides through the sinking of particulate organic matter is low dachs et al 2002 harms et al 2021 ma et al 2021 resulting in an increase in dissolved pesticides to the extent that the fugacity gradient shifted from a net oceanic uptake to a net release thus the low fugacity ratio combined with high water temperatures could make the pacific and indian oceans a secondary source of some pesticides into the air in the southern ocean most pesticides showed negative faw values with median values ranging from 2600 ng m2 day tebuconazole to 0 34 ng m2 day o p dde except for hcb 7 3 ng m2 day chloroneb 0 20 ng m2 day pentachloronitrobenzene 0 60 ng m2 day and p p dde 0 033 ng m2 day figs 5 and s7 which again suggests that they are currently settling from the atmosphere into seawater our results showed that in the southern ocean which is covered by our studied transect pesticides are not currently migrating from seawater to the atmosphere deposition fluxes of pesticides like α hch γ hch dieldrin and chlorpyrifos have been reported from the southern ocean bigot et al 2016 cincinelli et al 2009 galbán malagón et al 2013b xie et al 2011 antarctic peninsula dickhut et al 2005 galbán malagón et al 2013b and the arctic ocean lohmann et al 2009 distance from sources of pollution isolation of antarctic seawater by ac bengtson nash et al 2010 and loss processes in the seawater column biological and degradation pumps galbán malagón et al 2013a c reducing the presence of pesticides in the southern ocean the fact that some pesticides exhibit volatilization in the southern ocean may be related to the remobilization of pesticides accumulated in ice snow soil during a melting period kang et al 2012 ma et al 2011 potapowicz et al 2020 resulting in a temporary elevated pesticide concentrations in air and seawater in addition our samples were collected during the southern hemisphere summer because productivity in antarctic coastal polynyas is highest from december to february arrigo et al 2015 and biological pumping or degradation processes may reduce pesticide concentrations in seawater during high productivity summers bigot et al 2016 boyd et al 1995 dachs et al 1999 2002 galbán malagón et al 2013a gioia et al 2008 tréguer and jacques 1992 affecting sinking fluxes and the relative ratios of air seawater exchange 4 conclusions the occurrence and air seawater exchange of pesticides of various properties in air and seawater from the western pacific to the southern ocean 19 75 n 76 16 s were measured and interpreted a clear north south decreasing level gradient was found for pesticides in both air and seawater samples this gradient confirms the input of pesticides from inland and the limited influences of the southern ocean from pesticides contamination air masses origins riverine inputs continental discharges and ocean currents play an important role in determining the fate of pesticides in the marine environment air seawater exchange results indicate that the western pacific and indian oceans are secondary sources of most pesticides into the atmosphere while the southern ocean remains a sink for most pesticides the results of pesticide concentrations and air seawater exchange suggest that monitoring pesticide concentrations from china to antarctica at high geospatial resolution is essential to better understand their spatial variability and to quantify the transport and exposure pathways of pops in the marine environment this study provides one of the few reports on the occurrence of pesticides in air and seawater along a transect from china to antarctica contributing to a better understanding of the fate of pesticides in the marine environment more sampling sites are required to improve our understanding on the fate of pesticides in addition pesticide concentrations should be measured in antarctica which would provide insight into the occurrence of

pacific towards the southern ocean back trajectory analysis showed that atmospheric pesticide concentrations were strongly influenced by air masses origins continental and riverine inputs are important sources of pesticides in the western pacific and indian oceans atmospheric and seawater concentrations for the target pesticide residues in the southern ocean are low and evenly distributed

been widely reported with a particular focus on levels and trends in the atmosphere and seawater bidleman et al 2007 galbán malagón et al 2013a gioia et al 2012 huang et al 2013 wu et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 zhong et al 2012 while less information is available on the spatial variability of pesticides in the southern ocean bigot et al 2016 galbán malagón et al 2013c these reported studies have markedly enhanced our knowledge on pesticide behavior in the marine environment especially in the northern hemisphere however pesticide dynamics at the multi compartment level in the southern hemisphere covering large geographic ocean regions remain relatively unexplored according more knowledge on their fate in the southern hemisphere marine environment is needed to provide insight into the biogeochemical processes compound specific mobility and temporal variability of pesticides in the global ocean anthropogenic pollutants including persistent pesticides are transported from the continental shelves into the open oceans subsequently they are further transported via poleward directed ocean currents zhang et al 2019 synchronously dynamic exchange of pesticides occurs at the air seawater interface biological pumps have the potential to remove pesticides from the atmosphere through air seawater exchange and by subsequently settling particles into deep water bodies carrizo et al 2017 galbán malagón et al 2012 jurado et al 2004 air seawater exchange is therefore an important supporting process that controls the inter compartmental migration residence time and ultimately the environmental fate of persistent pesticides in the marine environment dachs et al 2002 ding et al 2007 jantunen et al 2008 2015 comprehensive earlier studies mainly focused on the arctic pacific basin have largely enhanced our understanding of pesticide transport pathways and fate on large spatial and temporal scales jantunen et al 2015 pućko et al 2012 ya et al 2019 zhong et al 2012 however these studies were largely focused on halogenated and persistent organic pesticides the large group of current used pesticides cups largely remain unexplored in addition few pesticide assessments are currently available to date on the antarctica and the adjacent southern ocean bigot et al 2016 2017 choi et al 2008 dickhut et al 2005 galbán malagón et al 2013b jantunen et al 2004 the sampling in this study provides a unique opportunity to measure air seawater exchange and to determine whether gaseous pesticides are deposited to the surface seawater of the southern ocean gaseous and aqueous samples were sampled during an antarctic expedition in 2018 2019 chinare 35 for studying the role of ocean as medium for distribution and carrier of pesticide residues by analyzing pesticides in the samples we aim to elucidate the presence land ocean interactions and distribution patterns of pesticides along the transect from the western pacific to the southern ocean 179 29 177 48 e 76 16 19 75 n the specific objectives of this study were to better understand 1 the overall concentration and geographical distribution of pesticides in gaseous and aqueous samples from the western pacific to the southern ocean and their environmental implications 2 the importance of continental inputs on the occurrence of pesticides in the marine environment and 3 the direction of air seawater exchange 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection aqueous and gaseous phase samples from the western pacific to the southern ocean were collected during chinare 35 between november 2018 and march 2019 the detailed cruise route is depicted in fig 1 and tables s1 and s2 in the supporting information si air samples were collected using a high volume solid phase extraction hv spe sampler text s1 equipped with a glass fiber filter gff 0 7 µm cut off whatman 142 mm diameter to collect the particulate phase followed by a column filled with pre cleaned xad 2 resin sigma amberlite 20 60 mesh 42 g to collect the gaseous phase for aqueous phase surface seawater was extracted from a stainless steel tube at a depth of 4 m surface seawater was pre filtered through gff to remove suspended particulate matter and then passed through a hv spe sampler xad columns were stored at 20 c prior to analysis detailed information on the methods used to collect air and seawater samples can be found in our previous study zhang et al 2021 and is summarized in the si 2 2 pesticide extraction and instrumental analysis all samples were pretreated using an in situ internal ultrasonic technology text s1 prior to extraction 100 μl of 1 0 ng μl of internal standard heptachlor epoxide isomer b was added to column as a recovery standard after equilibration for 30 min 45 ml of acetone dichloromethane n hexane 1

the sample extracts were analyzed for 221 pesticides using an agilent 7890b gas chromatograph coupled to a 7010b triple quadrupole mass spectrometer gc ms ms agilent palo alto ca usa details of the instrumental analysis are provided in the si a complete list of analytes can be found in tables s3 and s4 2 3 quality assurance and quality control all materials used for sampling were thoroughly cleaned and suitably stored text s1 field blank levels were 10 for all samples and not blank corrected was performed zhang et al 2017 the method detection limits mdls were calculated as equal to the blank plus the concentration corresponding to a signal to noise ratio of 3 zhang et al 2019 concentrations below the mdls were replaced by the mdl value divided by the square root of 2 the mdls were estimated to 0 002 38 pg m3 gaseous and 0 003 76 pg l aqueous tables s3 and s4 generally 27 pesticides were frequently detected in gaseous and aqueous samples with most compounds were not detectable or below mdl therefore were not considered for statistical data interpretation the recoveries of heptachlor epoxide isomer b in gas and seawater ranged from 44 to 128 mean 77 and 42 to 127 mean 66 respectively the median recoveries of individual pesticides in spiked samples ranged from 52 to 110 in air samples and 43 to 136 in seawater samples table s5 the final concentration of pesticides was recovered but not blank corrected detailed descriptions of the sampling qa qc are described in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 pesticide detection and concentrations in air and seawater of the 221 target pesticides analyzed 24 were identified in more than 50 of the gaseous samples and 25 were identified in more than 70 of the aqueous samples and the following discussion will focus only on these pesticides the detection frequency and concentration of pesticides across the sampling regions are summarized in table s5 figs s1 and s2 propoxur hexachlorobenzene hcb acetochlor dicofol triadimefon penconazole tebuconazole epoxiconazole chloroneb diphenylamine myclobutanil pentachloronitrobenzene tetraconazole o p dde α hch β hch γ hch p p dde and propiconazole were detected in 80 of the gaseous and aqueous samples oxadiazon hexazinone and fenarimol were detected at 50 in both phases p p ddt and fluquinconazole were detected only in gaseous samples while dicloran fipronil and methidathion were detected only in aqueous samples table s5 it should be mentioned that hcb has historically been widely used as a fungicide but is currently mainly an intermediate product and by product of the production of some chlorinated compounds ya et al 2019 current hcb comes from primary emissions e g by products of chlorinated chemicals and incineration combustion processes and secondary emissions e g re emissions from soil sediment and water liu et al 2009 su et al 2006 the most abundant pesticides in air and seawater were tebuconazole range 39 170 pg m3 53 430 pg l diphenylamine range 8 0 190 pg m3 64 530 pg l hcb range 1 9 95 pg m3 3 7 30 pg l and myclobutanil range 7 4 64 pg m3 3 8 240 pg l fig 2 the low abundance of p p dde relative to p p ddt is usually associated with a fresh source of ddt in the atmosphere shen et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 the p p ddt p p dde usually lower than 1 suggesting the absence of recent ddt sources in the sampled regions similar phenomenon were found in the arctic ecosystems cabrerizo et al 2019 carrizo et al 2017 lohmann et al 2009 the detection of pesticides in remote oceans reinforces its classification as a global contaminant galbán malagón et al 2013c meanwhile the presence of pesticides in the southern ocean suggests that these pops are continuing the lrat ocean currents transport and depositing into remote ecosystems the observed air concentrations of α hch 0 18 1 7 pg m3 β hch 0 16 2 5 pg m3 γ hch 0 18 1 3 pg m3 p p dde 0 12 2 7 pg m3 and o p dde 0 062 0 84 pg m3 in the western pacific and indian oceans were almost one magnitude lower than those reported over the indian ocean in 2004 wurl et al 2006 the andaman sea and bay of bengal and chinese marginal seas in 2008 gioia et al 2012 and one or two magnitudes lower than those measured in the eastern indian and northern pacific oceans three decades ago iwata et al 1993 the median seawater concentration of α hch 1 8 pg l β hch 5 6 pg l and γ hch 3 1 pg l in the western pacific and indian oceans were comparable to those reported in the equatorial indian ocean huang et al 2013 and were lower than those reported in the bohai and yellow seas china zhong et al 2014 the north atlantic and arctic oceans lohmann et al 2009 wong et al 2011 owing to the phase out of technical hch the atmospheric levels of α hch 0 081 0 81 pg m3 β hch 0 079 2 4 pg m3 γ hch 0 081 0 96 pg m3 and hcb 1 9 36 pg m3 over the southern ocean are comparable to previous studies cincinelli et al 2009 galbán malagón et al 2013b jantunen et al 2004 xie et al 2011 the concentrations of α hch β hch γ hch p p dde o p dde and hcb in the southern ocean ranged from 0 52 to 2 3 0 83 to 5 7 0 96 to 3 8 0 28 to 1 4 0 092 to 1 58 and 3 7 to 22 pg l respectively the concentrations of α hch and γ hch were about an order of magnitude lower than those reported in the southern ocean two decades ago iwata et al 1993 jantunen et al 2004 however our results for hcb γ hch β hch p p dde and o p dde are similar to those of the antarctic peninsula galbán malagón et al 2013c the southern ocean between australia and antarctica bigot et al 2016 and the atlantic indian sector of the southern ocean xie et al 2011 demonstrating that the deposition volatilization and transport of these pesticides in the southern ocean may have stabilized bigot et al 2016 3 2 spatial distribution and influencing factors decreasing spatial trends in atmospheric concentrations from the western pacific high to the southern ocean low were found for propoxur hcb acetochlor dicofol triadimefon diphenylamine oxadiazon chloroneb p p ddt p p dde o p dde α hch β hch and pentachloronitrobenzene in addition to triadimefon hexazinone tebuconazole myclobutanil and fluquinconazole significantly higher concentrations of other pesticides were observed at sites a3 a4 a5 a33 a34 a35 and a36 in the western pacific ocean mann whitney test p 0 05 which were influenced by air masses containing air from southeastern australia southeast asia and mainland china fig s3s3 where extensive agricultural activities and thus pesticide uses occur lin et al 2015 ya et al 2019 zhong et al 2012 this is consistent with the high concentrations of organochlorine pesticides ocps measured in these areas lin et al 2015 ya et al 2019 except for hexazinone and epoxiconazole other pesticide concentrations over the southern ocean 60 77º s did not show any significant variations with latitudes spearman correlation p 0 05 similar to that observed for σhchs chlorpyrifos and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons over the southern ocean bigot et al 2016 cabrerizo et al 2014 the southern ocean is far from emission sources and pollutants over the southern ocean are driven primarily by volatilization from soil snow and ice lrat air seawater exchange atmospheric deposition and biological pumps bengtson nash et al 2017 bigot et al 2016 2017 cabrerizo et al 2019 galbán malagón et al 2013c luek et al 2017 in addition the air mass over the southern ocean is thought to be a mixture of clean oceanic and antarctic continental air masses resulting in low and uniformly distributed concentrations in the southern ocean atmosphere cabrerizo et al 2014 latitudinal trends in pesticide concentrations in seawater were also found the concentrations of all pesticides decreased linearly from north to south r2 0 096 to 0 47 p 0 05 figs 3 and s4 sites with high pesticide concentrations in the pacific ocean are adjacent to densely populated continents that host diverse pesticide use lin et al 2015 ya et al 2019 zhong et al 2012 in contrast lower pesticide concentrations in the southern ocean confirm their remoteness to potential sources significantly higher pesticide concentrations were found in the coastal regions of the western pacific and indian oceans samples w1 14 w61 71 mann whitney test p 0 01 significantly higher concentrations of pops have been reported in coastal seawater than in the open sea with sources have been identified as terrestrial sources mainly through continental discharges gonzález gaya et al 2016 zhang et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 the variation of pesticide concentrations was investigated in the vicinity of the coastline of the pacific and indian oceans to understand the impacts of continental discharges except for propoxur fipronil and hcb the other pesticides showed a significant linear decreasing trend with increasing distance from the coastline r2 0 098 to 0 31 p 0 05 fig s5 furthermore a significant inverse correlation was detected between salinity and concentrations of diphenylamine and methidathion rs 0 44 p 0 05 implying a possible riverine influence zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 correlations between individual pesticides and distance and salinity in coastal seawater reflect the effects of continental discharges and continuous riverine inputs on pesticide concentrations similarly lin et al 2015 found that in the coastal areas of the east china sea ocps concentrations displayed an increasing trend close to the coast zhang et al 2019 found a significant inverse correlation between salinity and concentrations of poly and perfluoroalkyl substances in the western atlantic margin explaining the continental emissions as a major source of seawater elevated pesticide concentrations were observed at sites 10 and 11 along the east coast of australia an area influenced by the east australian current eac the eac is a boundary current flowing southward along the east coast of australia severely but comparatively steadily impinging on the continental shelf and slope the accumulation of continental discharges under the role of eac as mentioned above could account for the high pesticide concentrations the antarctic convergence ac is a barrier where cold antarctic seawater flowing northward sinks beneath relatively warm water from lower latitudes and can control the fate of pesticides bigot et al 2016 the concentrations of the pesticides except for myclobutanil hcb propiconazole o p dde tetraconazole and pentachloronitrobenzene were significantly higher in the north of the ac than in the south mann whitney test p 0 01 demonstrating that the north south transfer of pesticides may be hindered by the ac as has been studied in the literature for β hch heptachlor epoxide b and perfluorinated contaminants bengtson nash et al 2010 bigot et al 2016 the large distance to emission sources and the obstruction of ac further confirms the lower characteristics of pesticide concentrations in the southern ocean 3 3 air seawater exchange air seawater exchange is an important process in the migration and diffusion of pesticides in the marine environment to understand the equilibrium of the air seawater exchange the fugacity ratio fa fw was calculated the uncertainty of the fugacity ratio calculated from the pesticide concentration in gas and seawater temperature and henry s law constant is 58 in the sampling region a fa fw 3 8 1 and 0 26 denotes net deposition equilibrium and net volatilization respectively and 0 26 fa fw 3 8 was treated as not significantly different from the air seawater equilibrium the calculation of fa fw air seawater exchange fluxes faw ng m2 d and associated error propagations are shown in text s2 fugacity ratios are depicted in figs 4 and s6 for pesticides with detection frequencies above 90 to reduce error propagations the fugacity ratio was lower than 0 26 for hcb in 62 of the samples indicating a significant net volatilization from seawater to air significant net deposition fa fw 3 8 was observed for β hch in 80 of the samples and for γ hch in 55 of the samples chloroneb diphenylamine pentachloronitrobenzene p p dde o p dde and α hch had fugacity ratios that were not significantly different from equilibrium in 53 84 of the samples hch and p p dde were reported to be in near equilibrium between air and water in the lakes of melville island and barrow strait tending to volatilize in the summer and deposit in the winter cabrerizo et al 2019 the behavior of acetochlor dicofol penconazole tebuconazole and propoxur was far away from the air seawater equilibrium showing a significant net deposition in all regions net deposition of dicofol has been reported over a transect from the east asian sea to the arctic ocean zhong et al 2012 and the bohai and yellow seas china zhong et al 2014 although atmospheric concentrations of some ocps have decreased over the past decades bigot et al 2016 no significant level changes in dicofol have been reported in remote subpolar or polar regions li et al 2015 suggesting that it is being continuously emitted into the environment the log fa fw of α hch was significantly correlated with other pesticides r2 0 60 0 90 p 0 01 fig 4 moreover this cross correlation was also widespread among the 14 pesticides suggesting that similar transport trends and or proportional fugacity ratios of different pesticides pesticides exhibited different atmosphere sea surface partitioning directions in the different sampling regions in the western pacific and indian oceans significant net volatilization was observed for hcb chloroneb and pentachloronitrobenzene in most samples 59 100 indicating that seawater continues to be a source of these pesticides into the atmosphere in contrast no pesticides exhibited net volatilization in the southern ocean diphenylamine α hch β hch γ hch acetochlor dicofol penconazole tebuconazole and propoxur showed fa fw 3 8 in most samples 77 100 suggesting that the predominant process for these pesticides was deposition from the atmosphere to seawater the remaining pesticides are in the range of the equilibrium window this implies that atmospheric pesticides are still a source to the seawater in the southern ocean the possible reason is that the transport of volatile pesticides from seawater to the atmosphere is limited by the significantly lower seawater temperature in the southern ocean than in the western pacific and indian oceans mann whitney test p 0 01 higher temperatures facilitate the transport of pops from the water column to the atmosphere mainly for legacy pops whose concentration in the atmosphere have ended and whose lifetimes in seawater are much higher than that in the atmosphere cabrerizo et al 2019 ma et al 2018 different patterns were observed in the magnitude and direction of pesticide air seawater fluxes from the western pacific to the southern ocean figs 5 and s7 at all sampling sites average deposition fluxes were dominated by five pesticides acetochlor 370 to 6 0 ng m2 day dicofol 420 to 10 ng m2 day penconazole 990 to 78 ng m2 day tebuconazole 5300 to 1000 ng m2 day and propoxur 98 to 2 ng m2 day with net deposition significantly different mann whitney test p 0 05 from equilibrium as defined above in the western pacific and indian oceans the greatest net volatilization fluxes were always observed for hcb chloroneb and pentachloronitrobenzene with median values were 22 ng m2 day 1 4 ng m2 day and 2 8 ng m2 day in the western pacific ocean and 6 3 ng m2 day 1 2 ng m2 day and 0 99 ng m2 day in the indian ocean respectively p p dde 0 60 ng m2 day o p dde 0 14 ng m2 day α hch 0 84 ng m2 day and γ hch 0 97 ng m2 day in the western pacific ocean and p p dde 0 49 ng m2 day o p dde 0 099 ng m2 day in the indian ocean showed the statistical equilibrium 0 26 fa fw 3 8 but those pesticides still showed a tendency to volatilize at higher fluxes net volatilization fluxes were observed in the western pacific and indian oceans indicating that riverine inputs and continental discharges were more significant sources of dissolved pesticides than atmospheric deposition liu et al 2016 similar volatilization or near equilibrium conditions fluxes of p p dde γ hch and α hch were also observed in the east china sea lin et al 2015 and the equatorial indian ocean huang et al 2013 restriction or prohibition of primary releases of hch and ddt in most parts of the world lin et al 2015 and degradation leading to lower environmental concentrations the ocean can act as a buffer accumulating pesticides during periods of high emissions while the atmosphere responds more quickly to reduced emissions resulting in low air seawater fugacity ratios zhang and lohmann 2010 in the oligotrophic pacific and indian oceans the downward loss of pesticides through the sinking of particulate organic matter is low dachs et al 2002 harms et al 2021 ma et al 2021 resulting in an increase in dissolved pesticides to the extent that the fugacity gradient shifted from a net oceanic uptake to a net release thus the low fugacity ratio combined with high water temperatures could make the pacific and indian oceans a secondary source of some pesticides into the air in the southern ocean most pesticides showed negative faw values with median values ranging from 2600 ng m2 day tebuconazole to 0 34 ng m2 day o p dde except for hcb 7 3 ng m2 day chloroneb 0 20 ng m2 day pentachloronitrobenzene 0 60 ng m2 day and p p dde 0 033 ng m2 day figs 5 and s7 which again suggests that they are currently settling from the atmosphere into seawater our results showed that in the southern ocean which is covered by our studied transect pesticides are not currently migrating from seawater to the atmosphere deposition fluxes of pesticides like α hch γ hch dieldrin and chlorpyrifos have been reported from the southern ocean bigot et al 2016 cincinelli et al 2009 galbán malagón et al 2013b xie et al 2011 antarctic peninsula dickhut et al 2005 galbán malagón et al 2013b and the arctic ocean lohmann et al 2009 distance from sources of pollution isolation of antarctic seawater by ac bengtson nash et al 2010 and loss processes in the seawater column biological and degradation pumps galbán malagón et al 2013a c reducing the presence of pesticides in the southern ocean the fact that some pesticides exhibit volatilization in the southern ocean may be related to the remobilization of pesticides accumulated in ice snow soil during a melting period kang et al 2012 ma et al 2011 potapowicz et al 2020 resulting in a temporary elevated pesticide concentrations in air and seawater in addition our samples were collected during the southern hemisphere summer because productivity in antarctic coastal polynyas is highest from december to february arrigo et al 2015 and biological pumping or degradation processes may reduce pesticide concentrations in seawater during high productivity summers bigot et al 2016 boyd et al 1995 dachs et al 1999 2002 galbán malagón et al 2013a gioia et al 2008 tréguer and jacques 1992 affecting sinking fluxes and the relative ratios of air seawater exchange 4 conclusions the occurrence and air seawater exchange of pesticides of various properties in air and seawater from the western pacific to the southern ocean 19 75 n 76 16 s were measured and interpreted a clear north south decreasing level gradient was found for pesticides in both air and seawater samples this gradient confirms the input of pesticides from inland and the limited influences of the southern ocean from pesticides contamination air masses origins riverine inputs continental discharges and ocean currents play an important role in determining the fate of pesticides in the marine environment air seawater exchange results indicate that the western pacific and indian oceans are secondary sources of most pesticides into the atmosphere while the southern ocean remains a sink for most pesticides the results of pesticide concentrations and air seawater exchange suggest that monitoring pesticide concentrations from china to antarctica at high geospatial resolution is essential to better understand their spatial variability and to quantify the transport and exposure pathways of pops in the marine environment this study provides one of the few reports on the occurrence of pesticides in air and seawater along a transect from china to antarctica contributing to a better understanding of the fate of pesticides in the marine environment more sampling sites are required to improve our understanding on the fate of pesticides in addition pesticide concentrations should be measured in antarctica which would provide insight into the occurrence of

16071,the formation of refractory compounds and high nitrogen concentrations in filtrates is the bottleneck of hydrothermal treatment ht for sludge deep dewatering to simultaneously solve these two problems tannic acid ta aided ht was firstly developed in this study ta addition improved dewaterability under all investigated ht temperatures by improving the sludge relative hydrophobicity moreover the effective ht temperature was reduced from 180 to 160 the soluble extracellular polymeric substances s epss of the sludge hydrothermally treated at 160 under the optimal ta dose 0 15 mmol g total solids contained 47 27 less total organic nitrogen than the s epss of the raw sludge this result means that the corresponding filtrate contained lower concentrations of refractory compounds and nitrogen than those under the conventional ht conditions and thus could be more easily treated furthermore the changes in the protein secondary structure and the interaction of ta with high molecular weight hmw proteins in s epss were found to be highly relevant p 0 05 to the improvement of sludge dewaterability with increasing ht temperature 120 180 the s eps hmw proteins with numerous hydrophilic functional groups hydroxyl and carboxyl were hydrolyzed and their secondary structures unfolded consequently more sites were exposed for hydrophobic binding with ta and the ta protein interaction was more stable and spontaneous the precipitation of protein with ta also increased with the ht temperature thus ta aided ht improves protein precipitation and sludge dewaterability through protein structure destruction and the production of more hydrophobic binding sites for ta the identification of the influencing mechanisms on ss eps ta interaction mode and binding capacity are conducive to the further upgrading of ta aided ht for engineering applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge dewatering hydrothermal treatment tannic acid high

transform infrared 1 introduction as the byproduct of wastewater treatment plants sewage sludge ss is a heterogeneous colloidal mixture system in addition to its high water content wc 95 99 and complex organic material content ss also contains pathogens hazardous metals and some toxic chemicals in 2019 39 04 million tons 80 wc of municipal ss was produced in china wei et al 2020 ss deep dewatering is necessary for transportation cost reduction and safe disposal such as through self incineration and landfilling however ss deep dewatering is challenging owing to the hydrophilic properties and stable gel like structure of colloidal systems and the sludge dewatering and drying unit is highly chemical and energy consuming liu et al 2021 chen et al 2020 numerous methods e g chemical physical biological and their combinations have been proposed to improve ss dewaterability wu et al 2020 cao et al 2021 among these methods hydrothermal treatment ht is regarded as one of the most efficient it involves a non evaporative thermochemical conversion process in which the highly hydrophilic macromolecules of extracellular polymeric substances epss are disrupted wang et al 2017 furthermore when dewatering one tone t of ss with 95 moisture content to 50 the energy consumption of ht 200 30 min was only 67 52 fecl3 pam thermal drying and 43 84 lime pam thermal drying of that for of traditional deep dewatering process liu et al 2021b dong et al 2014 thus ht has huge potential to replace traditional ss drying process and reduce the energy consumption of sludge treatment system in addition to improving ss dewatering efficiency ht can also improve anaerobic digestion ad efficiency and protein recovery from ss xue et al 2015 yu et al 2017 ht 160 180 30 60 min has been widely used as a pretreatment process in ad to improve biogas production by enhancing ss solubilization and protein conversion efficiency chen et al 2018 in a recent study ht in combination with alkaline treatment was proved effective for protein solubilization and recovery from ss xiao and zhou 2020 however ht was originally developed to improve sludge dewaterability haug et al 1978 most of previous research have reported that a high operating temperature generally 180 is necessary for effective dewatering bougrier et al 2008 wang et al 2014 reduced the moisture content of dewatered sludge cake to 42 via ht 180 60 min combined with mechanical expression 2 mpa 20 min peng et al 2021 observed that the destruction of proteins structures and improvement of sludge floc surface hydrophobicity were mainly responsible for the improvement of ss dewaterability during the solubilization and hydrolyzation stages 140 180 of ht process however in the carbonization stage 200 260 the high ht temperature resulted in dehydration and amine aldehyde condensation consequently the ss developed a smooth structural morphology and the water holding capacity of sludge flocs by capillary action was reduced chen et al 2022 even though ht is an efficient chemical free and energy saving preconditioning process the condensation of low molecular weight lmw melanoidins under the high operating ht temperature generally 180 considerably increases the amount of high molecular weight hmw 12 14 kda melanoidins thereby reducing the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability of dewatered filtrates wang et al 2011 moreover the soluble protein and ammonia concentrations of high solid sludge 16 7 ds can reach 27 500 and 2309 mg l at ht temperatures of 170 180 which remarkably increases the environmental risk and costs in the treatment of filtrates xue et al 2015 to solve the problems associated with the dewatered filtrates efficient ss deep dewatering at lower ht temperatures is vital researchers have tried reducing the effective ht temperature by introducing several auxiliary agents into the sludge floc to improve its compressibility and particle size wang et al 2020 used sawdust as a skeleton to improve the compressibility of ht sludge lowering the effective ht temperature from 180 to 150 yu et al 2014 reported that the addition of cacl2 to ht could improve the ht sludge dewatering efficiency and lower the effective ht temperature from 180 to 140 through charge neutralization however the addition of these skeleton materials and inorganic coagulants could not only increase the final volume of the dewatered sludge but also increase the environmental risk in the final disposal therefore to upgrade the sludge hydrothermal deep dewatering process it is vital to explore appropriate high efficiency auxiliary agents from natural sources tannic acid ta is a natural biodegradable biopolymer from plant secondary metabolites it is composed of abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups and hydrophobic phenyl rings fig s1 chung et al 1998 its unique chemical structure endows it with a series of chemical and physiological activities for example it effectively combines with protein and metal ions and thus is widely applied in the medical and food industries liu et al 2003 krishnamoorthy et al 2012 ge et al 2019c found that ta bonded with proteins in ss eps to form insoluble complexes thus improving ss dewaterability and promoting the release of bound water furthermore increasing the conditioning temperatures or lowering the ph value can change the interaction mode of ta protein in sludge epss leading to the improvement of ta protein binding capacity and ss dewatering efficiency since hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction are the main drivers of protein complexation and precipitation with ta ge et al 2019b ge et al 2019a however the physical mixing of ss with ta has a limited effect on the disintegration of epss and microbial cells which restricted the release of intracellular bound water our previous study found that the solubilization of hmw 70 kda proteins with hydrophilic gel like network structure was the key bottleneck limiting sludge dewaterability at low ht temperatures chen et al 2022 therefore the combined ta and ht provides an alternative method for efficient dewatering at low ht temperatures which has low energy consumption and environmental risk the effect of ta aided ht on sludge dewaterability and properties remains largely unknown moreover comprehensive studies on the variation in ss eps structure under different hydrothermal stages and the ss eps ta interaction mode and binding capacity are few which needed systemic research hence ta aided ht was investigated in this study to tackle the bottlenecks of ht in terms of dewatered filtrate treatment higher economic costs and environmental risk the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the effects of ta aided ht ta concentration of 0 00 0 25 mmol g total solids ts and ht temperature of 120 180 on sludge dewatering and physicochemical properties 2 investigate the changes of nitrogenous compound in the raw sludge rs and ht sludge before and after ta conditioning and 3 investigate the dewatering mechanism in terms of the potential correlation between the binding capacity of ta to sludge protein and eps characteristics through which a unified theory about the key influencing mechanisms on ss eps ta interaction mode and binding capacity could be identified this study also provides systematic theoretical guidance to further upgrading of ht for engineering applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and thermal hydrolysis experiments the ss used in this study was obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant shanghai china that adopted anaerobic anoxic aerobic processes the excess sludge from the secondary clarifier was pumped into a centrifugal dehydrator from which the sludge samples were fetched the sample was left to settle for 4 h after which the concentrated sample labeled rs was stored at 4 the experiments were performed in a 500 ml stainless steel reactor e 500 senlang china which was heated by an electric heating jacket first 400 g of rs samples were separately placed in the reactor and heated to different temperatures 120 140 160 and 180 with a residence time of 30 min the entire reaction was sealed and occurred under stirring at 100 rpm and saturated vapor pressure after ht the reaction product was cooled to room temperature using cold water the samples were labeled h t t denotes the ht temperature e g h 120 the main characteristics of rs and ht sludge are summarized in table s1 2 2 experimental procedure a series of bench scale experiments involving 150 ml sludge samples was conducted in 250 ml beakers to investigate the effects of ta on sludge dewaterability for each run different concentrations of ta 0 00 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 mmol g ts were added to the sludge samples in six identical beakers the ta and the sludge were mixed at 150 rpm for 1 min according to a previous study ge et al 2019c the sludge samples were kept stable for 15 min without stirring afterward the sludge dewaterability physicochemical properties and eps properties were analyzed all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analyses and statistical calculations the characterization of the ss dewatering performance physicochemical properties and epss properties is described in text s1 all analyses were performed in triplicate the relationship between sludge dewaterability and the eps characteristics was evaluated using pearson s correlation coefficient r2 value in the statistical software spss version 20 the r2 value ranged from 1 to 1 where 1 denotes a completely negative correlation 1 denotes a completely positive correlation and 0 denotes the absence of a linear relationship p 0 05 indicated statistically significant correlation and p 0 01 indicated extremely significant correlation the structural equation modeling was performed using spss and amos graphics amos version 21 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ta aided ht on sludge dewaterability the effects of the ta dose on the dewatering efficiencies of rs and ht sludge in terms of the capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf and wc of sludge cakes are depicted in fig 1 a c the cst and srf considerably increased with increasing ht temperature up to 140 after which they decreased this result is consistent with a previous study that found that sludge dewaterability increased up to an ht temperature threshold of 150 bougrier et al 2008 with ta addition the dewaterability efficiencies cst and srf of rs and ht sludge rapidly increased and tended to be stable at a ta dose of 0 15 mmol g ts the dewaterability of h 180 only slightly increased with ta addition as h 180 is easily dewatered so that ta addition did not have a strong effect moreover the wc of the dewatered sludge cake showed a comparable trend to those of cst and srf after vacuum filtration at 0 08 mpa the wc of h 160 with a ta concentration of 0 15 mmol g ts reached 69 87 which was similar to that of h 180 a higher temperature sample in wang et al 2014 the wc of sludge cake subjected to mechanical expression 6 mpa 20 min and ht temperature at 180 reached 20 in the current study the best sludge dewatering performance was achieved at an ht temperature of 160 and a ta dose of 0 15 mmol g ts the corresponding cst srf and wc of the dewatered sludge cake were reduced by 68 27 91 79 and 25 10 compared with those of rs thus ta aided ht reduced the effective ht temperature from 180 to 160 which can save energy and prevent the formation of refractory compounds by maillard reaction zhuang et al 2017 to better elucidate the effects of ta and ht on sludge dewaterability the distributions of free moisture fm mechanically bound moisture mbm and bound moisture bm in sludge samples are demonstrated in fig 1d and table s2 with the increase in the ta dose from 0 00 to 0 15 mmol g ts the bm contents in rs and ht sludge decreased rapidly the maximum reduction of bm 71 0 was achieved at an ht temperature and ta concentration of 160 and 0 15 mmol g ts respectively meanwhile with the addition of 0 15 mmol g ts ta the fm contents of rs and h 120 significantly increased by 20 3 and 11 6 respectively while the mbm contents decreased by 23 2 and 21 0 respectively this result suggests that the bm and mbm in rs and h 120 transformed into fm with ta addition however at higher ht temperatures with increasing ta dose from 0 00 to 0 15 mmol g ts the fm content in ht sludge only slightly increased while the mbm considerably increased indicating that the bm was transformed into mbm according to the above data the enhancement of rs and ht sludge dewaterability would be attributable to protein precipitation by ta through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction and bm conversion into fm and mbm de freitas and mateus 2012 moreover the efficacy of ta to remove bm in ht sludge increased with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 180 this indicates that protein produced under the various ht temperature conditions had different ta bonding capacities and efficiencies peng et al 2021 reported that the secondary structure of protein was destroyed at ht temperatures of 120 this suggests that the proteinaceous substrates were transformed and interacted with ta which are discussed in the following sections 3 2 effects of ta on the physicochemical properties of rs and ht sludge sludge dewaterability is largely determined by several physicochemical properties of the sludge mixture such as zeta potential and relative hydrophobicity li et al 2020 jin et al 2004 therefore the effects of the ta condition on these properties were investigated for rs and ht sludge zeta potential reflects the surface charge of sludge floc content generally a higher absolute value of zeta potential indicates a stronger electrostatic repulsion of sludge particles which is unfavorable to sludge dewaterability as depicted in fig 2 a the zeta potential of the ht 120 was significantly lower than that of rs and then increased from 34 to 27 mv with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 180 this is attributable to the biopolymer solubilization and hydrolyzation during ht which disrupted the eps structure and reduced the exposure of anionic groups in the sludge flocs however the zeta potential of rs and ht sludge became more negative or slightly increased with ta addition indicating that ta had a slight effect on the colloidal aggregation of the sludge this further confirms that charge neutralization was not the main ta protein binding pathway in the sludge consistent with the findings of özacar and şengil 2003 relative hydrophobicity is another surface characteristic of sludge that influences its dewaterability jin et al 2004 with increasing ta concentration from 0 00 to 0 15 mmol g ts the surface free energy δgadh of rs and ht sludge decreased rapidly and became more negative fig 2b and table s3 indicating that the sludge surface hydrophobicity increased with ta addition the enhancement in sludge hydrophobicity is attributable to the bonding between protein and ta as protein is the major hydrophilic polymeric substance in ss liu and fang 2003 moreover the sludge dewaterability srf and cst showed extremely significant positive correlations p 0 01 with δgadh table s8 indicating that the improvement relative hydrophobicity of the sludge flocs enhanced the dewaterability in addition with increasing ht temperature the ta increasingly enhanced the sludge hydrophobicity the lowest δgadh 28 74 mj m2 was achieved at the ht temperature and ta concentration of 160 and 0 15 mmol g ts respectively these results suggest that the binding capacity of ta with the ht sludge protein varied with the ht temperature which is attributable to the differences in the protein molecular weight and spatial structure 3 3 effects of ta on the characteristics of nitrogenous compounds in different fractions of rs and ht sludge epss the distribution and spatial structure of epss the key structural material of sludge flocs significantly affect sludge dewaterability and other physicochemical properties wei et al 2018a furthermore ss dewaterability is more influenced by the distribution and specific molecular structure of proteins than those of other components polysaccharides and humic acids xiao et al 2016 in addition ta has been widely demonstrated to improve ss dewaterability by bonding with protein thus the effects of ta on the characteristics of nitrogenous compounds in the different eps fractions were assessed 3 3 1 distribution and contents of nitrogenous compounds the effects of ta conditioning on the nitrogenous components total organic nitrogen ton and nh4 nh3 n of the different eps fractions of rs and ht sludge samples are demonstrated in fig 3 a and b with increasing ta concentration from 0 00 to 0 15 mmol g ts the ton concentration in soluble epss s epss decreased rapidly this finding is consistent with the results of a previous study in which the protein in s epss effectively bonded and precipitated with ta ge et al 2019 moreover the s eps ton and total organic carbon toc removal efficiencies increased with increasing temperature under a fixed ta concentration fig s2 the maximum s eps protein removal 70 1 was achieved at 180 and the ta dose of 0 15 mmol g ts thus the ability of ta to bond with protein increased with increasing ht temperature attributable to the changes in protein molecular structure in contrast the ton and toc concentrations of bound epss b epss in the ht sludge samples increased with increasing ta concentration except for h 120 the volatile solids total solids concentrations of the ht sludge samples also showed similar variation trends with ta addition fig s3 these results suggest that the organic compounds particularly protein in s epss precipitated in the inner layer and transformed into b eps and a solid phase and nh4 nh3 n stacking occurred by hydrogen bonding fig 2b furthermore the b eps ton concentration increased with the ht temperature under a fixed ta concentration the maximum ton increase 79 6 corresponded to an ht temperature and ta concentration of 160 and 0 15 mmol g ts respectively this further confirms that the s eps protein ta interaction intensity and precipitation efficiency increased with the ht temperature the decreasing concentrations of s eps ton and nh4 nh3 n at higher ht temperatures 120 reduce the nitrogenous compound load of the side stream treatment process of the dewatered filtrate thereby alleviating the main challenge of ht wilson and novak 2009 the relative hydrophobicity of sludge flocs δgadh showed a stronger negative correlation r2 0 665 p 0 01 with the b eps ton than s eps ton concentration this indicates that the shift in proteinaceous compounds from s eps to b eps is related to the enhanced sludge dewaterability consistent with previous studies chen et al 2015 3 3 2 the changes in protein molecular weight to elucidate the effects of ta conditioning on the conversion of proteins of different molecular weights in rs and ht sludge the types and molecular weights of proteins in the different eps fractions were analyzed via liquid chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection the changes in the hmw and lmw proteins in s epss were more significant than those of other compounds table 1 the hmw protein concentration increased with increasing ht temperature up to 140 after which it remarkably decreased demonstrating the intensive solubilization of organic compounds meanwhile the lmw protein concentration in s epss rapidly increased with ht temperature up to 180 this indicates that hydrolyzation was more significant than biopolymer solubilization under ht temperatures up to 140 consistent with the findings of a previous study wang et al 2021 with increasing ta dose from 0 00 to 0 15 mmol g ts the hmw and lmw protein concentrations in rs and ht sludge s epss decreased indicating that ta simultaneously interacted with the hmw and lmw proteins meanwhile combined with the changes of toc and ton in ht sludge eps section 3 3 1 under ht temperatures of 140 the increase in the hmw and lmw protein concentrations in b epss further confirms that proteins in s eps were immobilized to the inner layer b eps of sludge flocs through the binding of ta table s4 in addition the s eps hmw protein removal rate increased with the ht temperature under a fixed ta concentration indicating that the binding capacity of ta to s eps hmw protein can be strengthened at higher ht temperatures moreover the results of pearson correlation analysis indicated that sludge dewaterability cst and srf showed significant positive correlations with the s eps hmw protein concentration r2 0 601 p 0 05 and r2 0 588 p 0 05 respectively which were stronger than those with the lmw protein concentration r2 0 241 and r2 0 244 respectively thus the enhanced sludge dewaterability is related to the interaction between ta and the s eps hmw protein the predominance of hmw protein resulted in more clusters of bound water and stronger bridging resulted in a crosslinked and stable eps structure xiao et al 2017 the mechanisms through which higher ht temperatures improved the bonding capacity of ta with hmw protein are described in the following section 3 4 the interactions of ta with protein of rs and ht sludge at different ht temperatures based on the unique molecular structure of ta the interaction of ta with protein in sludge was mainly achieved through two non covalent binding first the phenolic hydroxyl groups of ta linked with the amino or carbonyl groups of peptide bonds in proteins via hydrogen bonding second benzene rings in ta interacted with the non polar residues in protein such as proline and tryptophan via hydrophobic effects soares et al 2009 jakobek 2015 therefore the ht induced molecular structure alteration of eps protein can affect the binding pathways between protein and ta which can result in the differences in the binding capacity of ta to protein in rs and ht sludge thus the effects of ht on the protein molecular structure and the potential relationship between protein molecular structure ta protein binding capacity and interaction pathway were further explored 3 4 1 the changes in functional groups in different eps fractions protein with multiple amino and carbonyl functional groups has a complex chemical structure to elucidate the ta effects on the molecular structures of eps proteins in the rs and ht sludge the functional groups in the different eps fractions of treated sludge samples were analyzed via fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy fig s4 the ftir spectra of the eps samples can be delineated into three types of organics hydrocarbons proteins and polysaccharides tables s5 in the spectra of the samples treated at 120 140 the intensities of peaks corresponding to s eps and b eps proteins and polysaccharides increased with ta addition indicating that more functional groups were exposed owing to eps abundance however the spectra of the samples treated at 160 exhibited reduced intensities with ta addition indicating that ta effectively precipitated the eps proteins these results indicate the relevance of the ta protein bonding capacity to the eps chemical structure to obtain more detailed information on the changes in the functional groups of epss in rs and ht sludge under the different ta doses the ftir results of sludge samples were further analyzed via 2d correlation spectroscopy the signs of the synchronous maps of different samples fig 4 showed the existence of six automatic peaks at 1650 1540 1450 1350 1200 and 1081 cm 1 to analyze the results of the synchronous and asynchronous maps the sequence of these peaks with increasing ta dose were found to follow the order rs 1081 cm 1 1250 cm 1 1350 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1540 cm 1 h 120 1081 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1350 cm 1 1250 cm 1 1540 cm 1 1650 cm 1 h 140 1081 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1350 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1250 cm 1 1540 cm 1 h 160 1250 cm 1 1350 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1540 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1081 cm 1 h 180 1540 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1350 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1250 cm 1 1081 cm 1 thus with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 140 the c o groups in amino acids and polysaccharides and the c o groups in amide ⅰ bonds first linked with ta then the n h in amide ⅱ and amide ⅲ bonds started bonding with ta increasing the sludge floc hydrophobicity however when the ht temperature exceeded 140 the n h in amide ⅱ or amide ⅲ bonds first bonded with ta and then the c o groups in amino acids bonded with ta likewise the reaction sequences of functional groups in rs and ht sludge b epss showed similar trends with increasing ta dose fig s5 this observation indicates that the ht temperature affected the ta protein binding site the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were exposed via proteins and polysaccharides solubilization at ht temperatures of 140 however the protein structure was destroyed at higher ht temperatures consequently the peptide chain was unfolded and numerous amide groups which have higher reactivity toward ta were exposed peng et al 2021 moreover the hydroxylation of ht sludge epss when ht temperature increased from 120 to 140 improved of binding with ta by hydrogen bridge binding and stronger than ht sludge epss produced under ht temperature exceeded 140 since the hydroxyl groups are more hydrophilic than amide groups in addition the presence of polysaccharides will disrupt the binding of protein to polyphenols and the polysaccharides will interact with polyphenols via hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of both compounds soares et al 2009 therefore it can be deduced that the solubilization of polysaccharides in the sludge samples and the ta polysaccharide interaction was one of the reasons for the lower ta protein binding capacity under sludge treatment at 120 fig s9 3 4 2 the changes in protein secondary structure the secondary structures of proteins determine the adsorption aggregation and hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of sludge flocs badireddy et al 2010 the amide ⅰ region of the ftir spectra of protein 1700 1600 cm 1 has often been resolved into six secondary structure peaks via second derivative analysis yin et al 2015 to explore the effects of ta on the secondary structure of eps proteins in rs and ht sludge the second derivative spectra were fitted according to the structure of the protein model described in tables s6 and s7 the α helix contents of s epss and b epss in h 160 decreased rapidly after ta conditioning whereas the secondary structures of epss in h 120 and h 140 remained stable even with the addition of 0 15 mmol g ts ta the formation of α helix was forced by the hydrogen bonding between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond n and the carbonyl oxygen of the peptide bond n 4 and the stability of the helix axis structure was maintained in the peptide therefore at ht temperatures of 160 the hydrogen bonds between the n 4 peptides are broken and exposed to the ta and consequently the peptides are further complexed and binding with ta by hydrogen bridge binding in addition a lower ratio of α helix β sheet random coil is often associated with a loosened protein structure you et al 2017 after ta conditioning the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil significantly decreased in the s epss of both rs and ht sludge but the changes in b eps was irregular fig 5 a as previously reported polyphenols can weaken the inter strand hydrogen bonds of protein secondary structure by forming hydrogen bonds with the outer β sheet resulting in a loose structure berhanu and masunov 2010 moreover the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil gradually decreased with increasing ht temperature and the highest decrease 17 46 was obtained at 160 this result indicates that the ta protein binding further loosened the protein structure in s eps thereby exposing the hydrophobic groups of proteins and benefiting the formation of protein polyphenol complexes via hydrophobic interaction this facilitated the precipitation of s eps protein li et al 2020 these results are consistent with the data in fig 3 3 4 3 changes in eps fluorescent components fluorescence regional integration analysis the binding of ta with epss in rs and ht sludge and the associated thermodynamics were further investigated using excitation emission matrix plots the plots for the sludge samples with different ta concentrations showed two major eps components figs s6 and s7 the first component occurred at excitation emission ex em wavelengths of 225 348 and 280 348 nm peaks a and b corresponding to aromatic protein and tryptophan protein like substances respectively the other component was detected at an ex em wavelength of 340 440 nm peak c corresponding to humic like substances chen et al 2003 with ta conditioning the fluorescence intensities of peaks a and b for different eps fractions decreased while the peak for humic like substances in b epss increased suggesting that the two types of fluorescence proteins crosslinked and precipitated with ta these results further verified the eps composition figs 3 and s2 the eps components can be divided into five regions fig s8 chen et al 2003 the calculated results of fluorescence region integration are shown in fig 6 a with increasing ta dose the s eps relative concentration of aromatic proteins ⅰ and ⅱ and soluble microbial by product like material smbp in sludge samples treated at 140 decreased rapidly whereas h 120 s epss exhibited no significant reduction smbp mainly contains hydrophilic amino acids which have a high ability to bind water chen et al 2003 these results indicate that ta effectively bonded with the protein like substances at ht temperatures of 140 the protein removal rate by ta increased with the ht temperature during the ht the protein was first released from the micro cell in the solubilization stage 25 120 and had a compact and stable structure with increasing ht temperature the protein was hydrolyzed and the peptide chain was gradually unfolded consistent with our results chen et al 2022 thus it is reasonable explanation for these results is that the ta could more strongly bind and interact with the loose proteins than with the gel like compact protein this explanation was further confirmed by the changes in the binding site number n and binding mode of ta to epss in rs and ht sludge as described in the next paragraphs fluorescence quenching of epss by ta the binding constants logkλ and n between ta and epss for rs and ht sludge were calculated using the scatchard equation table 2 pan et al 2010 the n and logkλ between ta and epss peaks a and b for h 120 were less than those of rs indicating that the stability of the crosslinked structure and the binding capacity of ta toward h 120 epss were lower with increasing ht temperature the n and logkλ between ta and epss peaks a and b increased gradually with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 160 the n of s epss corresponding to peaks a and b increased from 1 42 to 2 27 and 0 51 to 1 02 respectively indicating that the binding rate of ta to the protein like substances was enhanced likewise with increasing temperature the logkλ for s epss corresponding to peaks a and b increased from 0 48 to 2 79 and 0 03 to 1 14 indicating that the structure of the protein ta complex formed in the sludge s epss was increasingly stable these results are consistent with the changes in ton with the ht temperature many studies have approved that the binding of ta to peaks a and b was dominantly driven by hydrophobic interaction ge et al 2019 jakobek 2015 thus it can be proposed that the protein removal in s epps by ta was mainly caused by the hydrophobic binding between the benzene rings of ta and hydrophobic amino acid residues in protein charlton et al 2002 the protein in h 120 s epss had a more compact and hydrophilic structure than that in rs s epss fig 5 which could restrict the precipitation of protein with ta in the ht sludge this also explains the different ton removal rates by ta in ht sludge s eps 3 4 4 relationship between the intensity of fluorescent components protein characteristics and sludge dewaterability the potential relationships between fluorescent components and the molecular structure of proteinaceous compounds in s epss were evaluated through pearson s correlation analysis fig 7 a the fluorescence intensities of aromatic protein and tryptophan protein like substances showed a significant positive correlation with the protein secondary structure of α helix r 0 557 p 0 05 r 0 542 p 0 05 respectively and with the α helix β sheet random coil ratio r 0 573 p 0 01 r 0 657 p 0 01 respectively this confirms that the complexing of aromatic protein and tryptophan protein like with ta by hydrophobic binding facilitated the destruction of the protein secondary structure these results agree with a previous study on polyphenol amyloid interactions in which polyphenol molecules induced the conformational change of protein molecules and pushed the β sheet apart resulting in the formation of a loose structure berhanu and masunov 2015 furthermore the fluorescence intensities of tryptophan protein like substances showed a strong positive correlation with the hmw protein concentration r 0 741 p 0 01 and aromatic protein showed a strong and negative correlation with the concentration of lmw neutrals r 0 643 p 0 01 the occurrence of hmw proteins impairs sludge dewaterability because of their gel like network structure and strong hydrophilicity liu et al 2016 the lmw neutrals were mainly composed of mono oligosaccharides alcohols and aldehydes which represent the truly hydrophobic fraction these results further emphasize that the improved sludge hydrophobicity was strongly associated with the binding capacity of ta with hmw protein structural equation models were applied to further investigate the direct and indirect correlations between relative hydrophobicity and sludge dewaterability the concentration of fluorescent components and the molecular weight and secondary structure of s eps proteins fig 7c and d the aromatic protein and tryptophan protein like substances indirectly affected the sludge hydrophobicity and dewaterability the four effect pathways are as follows aromatic protein tryptophan like protein like substances α helix δgadh srf aromatic protein tryptophan like protein like substances α helix α helix β sheet random coil δgadh srf aromatic protein tryptophan like protein like substances α helix α helix β sheet random coil hmw protein δgadh srf and tryptophan like protein like hmw protein δgadh srf these results suggest that the effects of ta conditioning on rs and ht sludge dewaterability were mainly related to the destruction of protein structure and reduction of molecular weight during binding and protein precipitation with ta thus more efforts should be focused on protein structure destruction and hmw protein removal to upgrading the ta aided ht process according to the above analyses the mechanism through which ta improves sludge dewaterability and eps ta interaction mode at different ht temperatures was deduced fig 8 3 5 energy and economic evaluation to comprehensively evaluate the financial and environmental feasibility of the ta aided ht process the energy and economic analyses of different sludge deep dewatering processes ht ta aided ht and thermal drying treatment were conducted the corresponding results are summarized in table s10 in this study the labor cost and infrastructure cost are not considered according to previously reported and the experimental results in this study the moisture content of dewatered sludge cake is assumed about 50 which produced by different sludge deep dewatering processes under optimal conditions respectively it clearly shows that ht and ta aided ht processes could save more energy which only 42 1 and 36 3 of total energy consumption of conventional thermal drying furthermore it should be noted that this calculation was not considered the steam generated from the pressure relief process after ht therefore the energy consumption of ht and ta aided ht processes could be further reduced in practicality by recovering the energy from the treatment system for the economic costs of different processes the ht and ta aided ht processes have lower economic costs than thermal drying treatment while the economic costs of ta aided ht process is higher than that of ht process by 25 11 which mainly attributed to the consumption of ta however it is noteworthy to mention that the addition of ta not only avoids the formation of refractory matters but also removals 47 27 of total nitrogen in dewatering filtrates as previously reported the economic costs of treating wastewater with high nitrogen concentrations is 21 38 5 yuan kg nh4 n through biological treatment janus and van der roest 1997 moreover the substances like phenols and furfural produced at higher ht temperature 180 had a superimposed inhibition for microbial activity which would reduce nitrogen removal efficiency during filtrate treatment chen et al 2019 thus although there is a chemical cost the ta aided ht process has a significant advantage over the conventional ht process in terms of economic benefit from the treatment of dewatered filtrates in addition the environmental risk of dewatered sludge produced by ta aided ht process is significantly lower than that treated by traditional ht and inorganic coagulants since ta is a natural biodegradable organic matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in ht sludge increased gradually with increasing ht temperature at carbonization stage 180 gong et al 2018 this result implied that the dewatered sludge produced by ta aided ht process has a better prospect for land application furthermore in this study the establishment of mechanism through which ta improves sludge dewaterability and removals the nitrogen in filtrates at different ht temperatures are conducive to upgrading ta aided ht process for engineering applications 4 conclusions in this study ta aided ht was used to simultaneously improve sludge dewatering and reduce the nitrogen concentration of the filtrate ta addition facilitated the dewaterability of rs and ht sludge at all investigated ht temperatures by improving the sludge relative hydrophobicity consequently the effective ht temperature was reduced from 180 to 160 moreover the efficiency of s eps protein removal by ta considerably increased with the ht temperature the changes in the protein secondary structure and the interaction of ta and hmw protein in s epss remarkably improved sludge dewaterability however the mechanisms of the ta aided ht in the different ht stages were different in the solubilization stage 120 the solubilization of proteins with numerous hydrophilic functional groups hydroxy and carboxyl endowed s epss with more binding sites for hydrogen bonding with ta and therefore a looser structure was formed at higher ht temperatures the s eps proteins were hydrolyzed and their secondary structures unfolded thereby exposing more sites for hydrophobic binding with ta moreover the ta protein interaction was more stable and spontaneous and protein precipitation and complexation was enhanced thus the molecular structure of protein was a key factor influencing the binding capacity and interaction mode between ta and sludge eps this work can serve as a basis for further studies on more efficient ta

16071,the formation of refractory compounds and high nitrogen concentrations in filtrates is the bottleneck of hydrothermal treatment ht for sludge deep dewatering to simultaneously solve these two problems tannic acid ta aided ht was firstly developed in this study ta addition improved dewaterability under all investigated ht temperatures by improving the sludge relative hydrophobicity moreover the effective ht temperature was reduced from 180 to 160 the soluble extracellular polymeric substances s epss of the sludge hydrothermally treated at 160 under the optimal ta dose 0 15 mmol g total solids contained 47 27 less total organic nitrogen than the s epss of the raw sludge this result means that the corresponding filtrate contained lower concentrations of refractory compounds and nitrogen than those under the conventional ht conditions and thus could be more easily treated furthermore the changes in the protein secondary structure and the interaction of ta with high molecular weight hmw proteins in s epss were found to be highly relevant p 0 05 to the improvement of sludge dewaterability with increasing ht temperature 120 180 the s eps hmw proteins with numerous hydrophilic functional groups hydroxyl and carboxyl were hydrolyzed and their secondary structures unfolded consequently more sites were exposed for hydrophobic binding with ta and the ta protein interaction was more stable and spontaneous the precipitation of protein with ta also increased with the ht temperature thus ta aided ht improves protein precipitation and sludge dewaterability through protein structure destruction and the production of more hydrophobic binding sites for ta the identification of the influencing mechanisms on ss eps ta interaction mode and binding capacity

dewatering is necessary for transportation cost reduction and safe disposal such as through self incineration and landfilling however ss deep dewatering is challenging owing to the hydrophilic properties and stable gel like structure of colloidal systems and the sludge dewatering and drying unit is highly chemical and energy consuming liu et al 2021 chen et al 2020 numerous methods e g chemical physical biological and their combinations have been proposed to improve ss dewaterability wu et al 2020 cao et al 2021 among these methods hydrothermal treatment ht is regarded as one of the most efficient it involves a non evaporative thermochemical conversion process in which the highly hydrophilic macromolecules of extracellular polymeric substances epss are disrupted wang et al 2017 furthermore when dewatering one tone t of ss with 95 moisture content to 50 the energy consumption of ht 200 30 min was only 67 52 fecl3 pam thermal drying and 43 84 lime pam thermal drying of that for of traditional deep dewatering process liu et al 2021b dong et al 2014 thus ht has huge potential to replace traditional ss drying process and reduce the energy consumption of sludge treatment system in addition to improving ss dewatering efficiency ht can also improve anaerobic digestion ad efficiency and protein recovery from ss xue et al 2015 yu et al 2017 ht 160 180 30 60 min has been widely used as a pretreatment process in ad to improve biogas production by enhancing ss solubilization and protein conversion efficiency chen et al 2018 in a recent study ht in combination with alkaline treatment was proved effective for protein solubilization and recovery from ss xiao and zhou 2020 however ht was originally developed to improve sludge dewaterability haug et al 1978 most of previous research have reported that a high operating temperature generally 180 is necessary for effective dewatering bougrier et al 2008 wang et al 2014 reduced the moisture content of dewatered sludge cake to 42 via ht 180 60 min combined with mechanical expression 2 mpa 20 min peng et al 2021 observed that the destruction of proteins structures and improvement of sludge floc surface hydrophobicity were mainly responsible for the improvement of ss dewaterability during the solubilization and hydrolyzation stages 140 180 of ht process however in the carbonization stage 200 260 the high ht temperature resulted in dehydration and amine aldehyde condensation consequently the ss developed a smooth structural morphology and the water holding capacity of sludge flocs by capillary action was reduced chen et al 2022 even though ht is an efficient chemical free and energy saving preconditioning process the condensation of low molecular weight lmw melanoidins under the high operating ht temperature generally 180 considerably increases the amount of high molecular weight hmw 12 14 kda melanoidins thereby reducing the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradability of dewatered filtrates wang et al 2011 moreover the soluble protein and ammonia concentrations of high solid sludge 16 7 ds can reach 27 500 and 2309 mg l at ht temperatures of 170 180 which remarkably increases the environmental risk and costs in the treatment of filtrates xue et al 2015 to solve the problems associated with the dewatered filtrates efficient ss deep dewatering at lower ht temperatures is vital researchers have tried reducing the effective ht temperature by introducing several auxiliary agents into the sludge floc to improve its compressibility and particle size wang et al 2020 used sawdust as a skeleton to improve the compressibility of ht sludge lowering the effective ht temperature from 180 to 150 yu et al 2014 reported that the addition of cacl2 to ht could improve the ht sludge dewatering efficiency and lower the effective ht temperature from 180 to 140 through charge neutralization however the addition of these skeleton materials and inorganic coagulants could not only increase the final volume of the dewatered sludge but also increase the environmental risk in the final disposal therefore to upgrade the sludge hydrothermal deep dewatering process it is vital to explore appropriate high efficiency auxiliary agents from natural sources tannic acid ta is a natural biodegradable biopolymer from plant secondary metabolites it is composed of abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups and hydrophobic phenyl rings fig s1 chung et al 1998 its unique chemical structure endows it with a series of chemical and physiological activities for example it effectively combines with protein and metal ions and thus is widely applied in the medical and food industries liu et al 2003 krishnamoorthy et al 2012 ge et al 2019c found that ta bonded with proteins in ss eps to form insoluble complexes thus improving ss dewaterability and promoting the release of bound water furthermore increasing the conditioning temperatures or lowering the ph value can change the interaction mode of ta protein in sludge epss leading to the improvement of ta protein binding capacity and ss dewatering efficiency since hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction are the main drivers of protein complexation and precipitation with ta ge et al 2019b ge et al 2019a however the physical mixing of ss with ta has a limited effect on the disintegration of epss and microbial cells which restricted the release of intracellular bound water our previous study found that the solubilization of hmw 70 kda proteins with hydrophilic gel like network structure was the key bottleneck limiting sludge dewaterability at low ht temperatures chen et al 2022 therefore the combined ta and ht provides an alternative method for efficient dewatering at low ht temperatures which has low energy consumption and environmental risk the effect of ta aided ht on sludge dewaterability and properties remains largely unknown moreover comprehensive studies on the variation in ss eps structure under different hydrothermal stages and the ss eps ta interaction mode and binding capacity are few which needed systemic research hence ta aided ht was investigated in this study to tackle the bottlenecks of ht in terms of dewatered filtrate treatment higher economic costs and environmental risk the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the effects of ta aided ht ta concentration of 0 00 0 25 mmol g total solids ts and ht temperature of 120 180 on sludge dewatering and physicochemical properties 2 investigate the changes of nitrogenous compound in the raw sludge rs and ht sludge before and after ta conditioning and 3 investigate the dewatering mechanism in terms of the potential correlation between the binding capacity of ta to sludge protein and eps characteristics through which a unified theory about the key influencing mechanisms on ss eps ta interaction mode and binding capacity could be identified this study also provides systematic theoretical guidance to further upgrading of ht for engineering applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and thermal hydrolysis experiments the ss used in this study was obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant shanghai china that adopted anaerobic anoxic aerobic processes the excess sludge from the secondary clarifier was pumped into a centrifugal dehydrator from which the sludge samples were fetched the sample was left to settle for 4 h after which the concentrated sample labeled rs was stored at 4 the experiments were performed in a 500 ml stainless steel reactor e 500 senlang china which was heated by an electric heating jacket first 400 g of rs samples were separately placed in the reactor and heated to different temperatures 120 140 160 and 180 with a residence time of 30 min the entire reaction was sealed and occurred under stirring at 100 rpm and saturated vapor pressure after ht the reaction product was cooled to room temperature using cold water the samples were labeled h t t denotes the ht temperature e g h 120 the main characteristics of rs and ht sludge are summarized in table s1 2 2 experimental procedure a series of bench scale experiments involving 150 ml sludge samples was conducted in 250 ml beakers to investigate the effects of ta on sludge dewaterability for each run different concentrations of ta 0 00 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 0 25 mmol g ts were added to the sludge samples in six identical beakers the ta and the sludge were mixed at 150 rpm for 1 min according to a previous study ge et al 2019c the sludge samples were kept stable for 15 min without stirring afterward the sludge dewaterability physicochemical properties and eps properties were analyzed all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analyses and statistical calculations the characterization of the ss dewatering performance physicochemical properties and epss properties is described in text s1 all analyses were performed in triplicate the relationship between sludge dewaterability and the eps characteristics was evaluated using pearson s correlation coefficient r2 value in the statistical software spss version 20 the r2 value ranged from 1 to 1 where 1 denotes a completely negative correlation 1 denotes a completely positive correlation and 0 denotes the absence of a linear relationship p 0 05 indicated statistically significant correlation and p 0 01 indicated extremely significant correlation the structural equation modeling was performed using spss and amos graphics amos version 21 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ta aided ht on sludge dewaterability the effects of the ta dose on the dewatering efficiencies of rs and ht sludge in terms of the capillary suction time cst specific resistance to filtration srf and wc of sludge cakes are depicted in fig 1 a c the cst and srf considerably increased with increasing ht temperature up to 140 after which they decreased this result is consistent with a previous study that found that sludge dewaterability increased up to an ht temperature threshold of 150 bougrier et al 2008 with ta addition the dewaterability efficiencies cst and srf of rs and ht sludge rapidly increased and tended to be stable at a ta dose of 0 15 mmol g ts the dewaterability of h 180 only slightly increased with ta addition as h 180 is easily dewatered so that ta addition did not have a strong effect moreover the wc of the dewatered sludge cake showed a comparable trend to those of cst and srf after vacuum filtration at 0 08 mpa the wc of h 160 with a ta concentration of 0 15 mmol g ts reached 69 87 which was similar to that of h 180 a higher temperature sample in wang et al 2014 the wc of sludge cake subjected to mechanical expression 6 mpa 20 min and ht temperature at 180 reached 20 in the current study the best sludge dewatering performance was achieved at an ht temperature of 160 and a ta dose of 0 15 mmol g ts the corresponding cst srf and wc of the dewatered sludge cake were reduced by 68 27 91 79 and 25 10 compared with those of rs thus ta aided ht reduced the effective ht temperature from 180 to 160 which can save energy and prevent the formation of refractory compounds by maillard reaction zhuang et al 2017 to better elucidate the effects of ta and ht on sludge dewaterability the distributions of free moisture fm mechanically bound moisture mbm and bound moisture bm in sludge samples are demonstrated in fig 1d and table s2 with the increase in the ta dose from 0 00 to 0 15 mmol g ts the bm contents in rs and ht sludge decreased rapidly the maximum reduction of bm 71 0 was achieved at an ht temperature and ta concentration of 160 and 0 15 mmol g ts respectively meanwhile with the addition of 0 15 mmol g ts ta the fm contents of rs and h 120 significantly increased by 20 3 and 11 6 respectively while the mbm contents decreased by 23 2 and 21 0 respectively this result suggests that the bm and mbm in rs and h 120 transformed into fm with ta addition however at higher ht temperatures with increasing ta dose from 0 00 to 0 15 mmol g ts the fm content in ht sludge only slightly increased while the mbm considerably increased indicating that the bm was transformed into mbm according to the above data the enhancement of rs and ht sludge dewaterability would be attributable to protein precipitation by ta through hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction and bm conversion into fm and mbm de freitas and mateus 2012 moreover the efficacy of ta to remove bm in ht sludge increased with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 180 this indicates that protein produced under the various ht temperature conditions had different ta bonding capacities and efficiencies peng et al 2021 reported that the secondary structure of protein was destroyed at ht temperatures of 120 this suggests that the proteinaceous substrates were transformed and interacted with ta which are discussed in the following sections 3 2 effects of ta on the physicochemical properties of rs and ht sludge sludge dewaterability is largely determined by several physicochemical properties of the sludge mixture such as zeta potential and relative hydrophobicity li et al 2020 jin et al 2004 therefore the effects of the ta condition on these properties were investigated for rs and ht sludge zeta potential reflects the surface charge of sludge floc content generally a higher absolute value of zeta potential indicates a stronger electrostatic repulsion of sludge particles which is unfavorable to sludge dewaterability as depicted in fig 2 a the zeta potential of the ht 120 was significantly lower than that of rs and then increased from 34 to 27 mv with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 180 this is attributable to the biopolymer solubilization and hydrolyzation during ht which disrupted the eps structure and reduced the exposure of anionic groups in the sludge flocs however the zeta potential of rs and ht sludge became more negative or slightly increased with ta addition indicating that ta had a slight effect on the colloidal aggregation of the sludge this further confirms that charge neutralization was not the main ta protein binding pathway in the sludge consistent with the findings of özacar and şengil 2003 relative hydrophobicity is another surface characteristic of sludge that influences its dewaterability jin et al 2004 with increasing ta concentration from 0 00 to 0 15 mmol g ts the surface free energy δgadh of rs and ht sludge decreased rapidly and became more negative fig 2b and table s3 indicating that the sludge surface hydrophobicity increased with ta addition the enhancement in sludge hydrophobicity is attributable to the bonding between protein and ta as protein is the major hydrophilic polymeric substance in ss liu and fang 2003 moreover the sludge dewaterability srf and cst showed extremely significant positive correlations p 0 01 with δgadh table s8 indicating that the improvement relative hydrophobicity of the sludge flocs enhanced the dewaterability in addition with increasing ht temperature the ta increasingly enhanced the sludge hydrophobicity the lowest δgadh 28 74 mj m2 was achieved at the ht temperature and ta concentration of 160 and 0 15 mmol g ts respectively these results suggest that the binding capacity of ta with the ht sludge protein varied with the ht temperature which is attributable to the differences in the protein molecular weight and spatial structure 3 3 effects of ta on the characteristics of nitrogenous compounds in different fractions of rs and ht sludge epss the distribution and spatial structure of epss the key structural material of sludge flocs significantly affect sludge dewaterability and other physicochemical properties wei et al 2018a furthermore ss dewaterability is more influenced by the distribution and specific molecular structure of proteins than those of other components polysaccharides and humic acids xiao et al 2016 in addition ta has been widely demonstrated to improve ss dewaterability by bonding with protein thus the effects of ta on the characteristics of nitrogenous compounds in the different eps fractions were assessed 3 3 1 distribution and contents of nitrogenous compounds the effects of ta conditioning on the nitrogenous components total organic nitrogen ton and nh4 nh3 n of the different eps fractions of rs and ht sludge samples are demonstrated in fig 3 a and b with increasing ta concentration from 0 00 to 0 15 mmol g ts the ton concentration in soluble epss s epss decreased rapidly this finding is consistent with the results of a previous study in which the protein in s epss effectively bonded and precipitated with ta ge et al 2019 moreover the s eps ton and total organic carbon toc removal efficiencies increased with increasing temperature under a fixed ta concentration fig s2 the maximum s eps protein removal 70 1 was achieved at 180 and the ta dose of 0 15 mmol g ts thus the ability of ta to bond with protein increased with increasing ht temperature attributable to the changes in protein molecular structure in contrast the ton and toc concentrations of bound epss b epss in the ht sludge samples increased with increasing ta concentration except for h 120 the volatile solids total solids concentrations of the ht sludge samples also showed similar variation trends with ta addition fig s3 these results suggest that the organic compounds particularly protein in s epss precipitated in the inner layer and transformed into b eps and a solid phase and nh4 nh3 n stacking occurred by hydrogen bonding fig 2b furthermore the b eps ton concentration increased with the ht temperature under a fixed ta concentration the maximum ton increase 79 6 corresponded to an ht temperature and ta concentration of 160 and 0 15 mmol g ts respectively this further confirms that the s eps protein ta interaction intensity and precipitation efficiency increased with the ht temperature the decreasing concentrations of s eps ton and nh4 nh3 n at higher ht temperatures 120 reduce the nitrogenous compound load of the side stream treatment process of the dewatered filtrate thereby alleviating the main challenge of ht wilson and novak 2009 the relative hydrophobicity of sludge flocs δgadh showed a stronger negative correlation r2 0 665 p 0 01 with the b eps ton than s eps ton concentration this indicates that the shift in proteinaceous compounds from s eps to b eps is related to the enhanced sludge dewaterability consistent with previous studies chen et al 2015 3 3 2 the changes in protein molecular weight to elucidate the effects of ta conditioning on the conversion of proteins of different molecular weights in rs and ht sludge the types and molecular weights of proteins in the different eps fractions were analyzed via liquid chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection the changes in the hmw and lmw proteins in s epss were more significant than those of other compounds table 1 the hmw protein concentration increased with increasing ht temperature up to 140 after which it remarkably decreased demonstrating the intensive solubilization of organic compounds meanwhile the lmw protein concentration in s epss rapidly increased with ht temperature up to 180 this indicates that hydrolyzation was more significant than biopolymer solubilization under ht temperatures up to 140 consistent with the findings of a previous study wang et al 2021 with increasing ta dose from 0 00 to 0 15 mmol g ts the hmw and lmw protein concentrations in rs and ht sludge s epss decreased indicating that ta simultaneously interacted with the hmw and lmw proteins meanwhile combined with the changes of toc and ton in ht sludge eps section 3 3 1 under ht temperatures of 140 the increase in the hmw and lmw protein concentrations in b epss further confirms that proteins in s eps were immobilized to the inner layer b eps of sludge flocs through the binding of ta table s4 in addition the s eps hmw protein removal rate increased with the ht temperature under a fixed ta concentration indicating that the binding capacity of ta to s eps hmw protein can be strengthened at higher ht temperatures moreover the results of pearson correlation analysis indicated that sludge dewaterability cst and srf showed significant positive correlations with the s eps hmw protein concentration r2 0 601 p 0 05 and r2 0 588 p 0 05 respectively which were stronger than those with the lmw protein concentration r2 0 241 and r2 0 244 respectively thus the enhanced sludge dewaterability is related to the interaction between ta and the s eps hmw protein the predominance of hmw protein resulted in more clusters of bound water and stronger bridging resulted in a crosslinked and stable eps structure xiao et al 2017 the mechanisms through which higher ht temperatures improved the bonding capacity of ta with hmw protein are described in the following section 3 4 the interactions of ta with protein of rs and ht sludge at different ht temperatures based on the unique molecular structure of ta the interaction of ta with protein in sludge was mainly achieved through two non covalent binding first the phenolic hydroxyl groups of ta linked with the amino or carbonyl groups of peptide bonds in proteins via hydrogen bonding second benzene rings in ta interacted with the non polar residues in protein such as proline and tryptophan via hydrophobic effects soares et al 2009 jakobek 2015 therefore the ht induced molecular structure alteration of eps protein can affect the binding pathways between protein and ta which can result in the differences in the binding capacity of ta to protein in rs and ht sludge thus the effects of ht on the protein molecular structure and the potential relationship between protein molecular structure ta protein binding capacity and interaction pathway were further explored 3 4 1 the changes in functional groups in different eps fractions protein with multiple amino and carbonyl functional groups has a complex chemical structure to elucidate the ta effects on the molecular structures of eps proteins in the rs and ht sludge the functional groups in the different eps fractions of treated sludge samples were analyzed via fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy fig s4 the ftir spectra of the eps samples can be delineated into three types of organics hydrocarbons proteins and polysaccharides tables s5 in the spectra of the samples treated at 120 140 the intensities of peaks corresponding to s eps and b eps proteins and polysaccharides increased with ta addition indicating that more functional groups were exposed owing to eps abundance however the spectra of the samples treated at 160 exhibited reduced intensities with ta addition indicating that ta effectively precipitated the eps proteins these results indicate the relevance of the ta protein bonding capacity to the eps chemical structure to obtain more detailed information on the changes in the functional groups of epss in rs and ht sludge under the different ta doses the ftir results of sludge samples were further analyzed via 2d correlation spectroscopy the signs of the synchronous maps of different samples fig 4 showed the existence of six automatic peaks at 1650 1540 1450 1350 1200 and 1081 cm 1 to analyze the results of the synchronous and asynchronous maps the sequence of these peaks with increasing ta dose were found to follow the order rs 1081 cm 1 1250 cm 1 1350 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1540 cm 1 h 120 1081 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1350 cm 1 1250 cm 1 1540 cm 1 1650 cm 1 h 140 1081 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1350 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1250 cm 1 1540 cm 1 h 160 1250 cm 1 1350 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1540 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1081 cm 1 h 180 1540 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1350 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1250 cm 1 1081 cm 1 thus with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 140 the c o groups in amino acids and polysaccharides and the c o groups in amide ⅰ bonds first linked with ta then the n h in amide ⅱ and amide ⅲ bonds started bonding with ta increasing the sludge floc hydrophobicity however when the ht temperature exceeded 140 the n h in amide ⅱ or amide ⅲ bonds first bonded with ta and then the c o groups in amino acids bonded with ta likewise the reaction sequences of functional groups in rs and ht sludge b epss showed similar trends with increasing ta dose fig s5 this observation indicates that the ht temperature affected the ta protein binding site the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups were exposed via proteins and polysaccharides solubilization at ht temperatures of 140 however the protein structure was destroyed at higher ht temperatures consequently the peptide chain was unfolded and numerous amide groups which have higher reactivity toward ta were exposed peng et al 2021 moreover the hydroxylation of ht sludge epss when ht temperature increased from 120 to 140 improved of binding with ta by hydrogen bridge binding and stronger than ht sludge epss produced under ht temperature exceeded 140 since the hydroxyl groups are more hydrophilic than amide groups in addition the presence of polysaccharides will disrupt the binding of protein to polyphenols and the polysaccharides will interact with polyphenols via hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of both compounds soares et al 2009 therefore it can be deduced that the solubilization of polysaccharides in the sludge samples and the ta polysaccharide interaction was one of the reasons for the lower ta protein binding capacity under sludge treatment at 120 fig s9 3 4 2 the changes in protein secondary structure the secondary structures of proteins determine the adsorption aggregation and hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of sludge flocs badireddy et al 2010 the amide ⅰ region of the ftir spectra of protein 1700 1600 cm 1 has often been resolved into six secondary structure peaks via second derivative analysis yin et al 2015 to explore the effects of ta on the secondary structure of eps proteins in rs and ht sludge the second derivative spectra were fitted according to the structure of the protein model described in tables s6 and s7 the α helix contents of s epss and b epss in h 160 decreased rapidly after ta conditioning whereas the secondary structures of epss in h 120 and h 140 remained stable even with the addition of 0 15 mmol g ts ta the formation of α helix was forced by the hydrogen bonding between the amide hydrogen of peptide bond n and the carbonyl oxygen of the peptide bond n 4 and the stability of the helix axis structure was maintained in the peptide therefore at ht temperatures of 160 the hydrogen bonds between the n 4 peptides are broken and exposed to the ta and consequently the peptides are further complexed and binding with ta by hydrogen bridge binding in addition a lower ratio of α helix β sheet random coil is often associated with a loosened protein structure you et al 2017 after ta conditioning the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil significantly decreased in the s epss of both rs and ht sludge but the changes in b eps was irregular fig 5 a as previously reported polyphenols can weaken the inter strand hydrogen bonds of protein secondary structure by forming hydrogen bonds with the outer β sheet resulting in a loose structure berhanu and masunov 2010 moreover the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil gradually decreased with increasing ht temperature and the highest decrease 17 46 was obtained at 160 this result indicates that the ta protein binding further loosened the protein structure in s eps thereby exposing the hydrophobic groups of proteins and benefiting the formation of protein polyphenol complexes via hydrophobic interaction this facilitated the precipitation of s eps protein li et al 2020 these results are consistent with the data in fig 3 3 4 3 changes in eps fluorescent components fluorescence regional integration analysis the binding of ta with epss in rs and ht sludge and the associated thermodynamics were further investigated using excitation emission matrix plots the plots for the sludge samples with different ta concentrations showed two major eps components figs s6 and s7 the first component occurred at excitation emission ex em wavelengths of 225 348 and 280 348 nm peaks a and b corresponding to aromatic protein and tryptophan protein like substances respectively the other component was detected at an ex em wavelength of 340 440 nm peak c corresponding to humic like substances chen et al 2003 with ta conditioning the fluorescence intensities of peaks a and b for different eps fractions decreased while the peak for humic like substances in b epss increased suggesting that the two types of fluorescence proteins crosslinked and precipitated with ta these results further verified the eps composition figs 3 and s2 the eps components can be divided into five regions fig s8 chen et al 2003 the calculated results of fluorescence region integration are shown in fig 6 a with increasing ta dose the s eps relative concentration of aromatic proteins ⅰ and ⅱ and soluble microbial by product like material smbp in sludge samples treated at 140 decreased rapidly whereas h 120 s epss exhibited no significant reduction smbp mainly contains hydrophilic amino acids which have a high ability to bind water chen et al 2003 these results indicate that ta effectively bonded with the protein like substances at ht temperatures of 140 the protein removal rate by ta increased with the ht temperature during the ht the protein was first released from the micro cell in the solubilization stage 25 120 and had a compact and stable structure with increasing ht temperature the protein was hydrolyzed and the peptide chain was gradually unfolded consistent with our results chen et al 2022 thus it is reasonable explanation for these results is that the ta could more strongly bind and interact with the loose proteins than with the gel like compact protein this explanation was further confirmed by the changes in the binding site number n and binding mode of ta to epss in rs and ht sludge as described in the next paragraphs fluorescence quenching of epss by ta the binding constants logkλ and n between ta and epss for rs and ht sludge were calculated using the scatchard equation table 2 pan et al 2010 the n and logkλ between ta and epss peaks a and b for h 120 were less than those of rs indicating that the stability of the crosslinked structure and the binding capacity of ta toward h 120 epss were lower with increasing ht temperature the n and logkλ between ta and epss peaks a and b increased gradually with increasing ht temperature from 120 to 160 the n of s epss corresponding to peaks a and b increased from 1 42 to 2 27 and 0 51 to 1 02 respectively indicating that the binding rate of ta to the protein like substances was enhanced likewise with increasing temperature the logkλ for s epss corresponding to peaks a and b increased from 0 48 to 2 79 and 0 03 to 1 14 indicating that the structure of the protein ta complex formed in the sludge s epss was increasingly stable these results are consistent with the changes in ton with the ht temperature many studies have approved that the binding of ta to peaks a and b was dominantly driven by hydrophobic interaction ge et al 2019 jakobek 2015 thus it can be proposed that the protein removal in s epps by ta was mainly caused by the hydrophobic binding between the benzene rings of ta and hydrophobic amino acid residues in protein charlton et al 2002 the protein in h 120 s epss had a more compact and hydrophilic structure than that in rs s epss fig 5 which could restrict the precipitation of protein with ta in the ht sludge this also explains the different ton removal rates by ta in ht sludge s eps 3 4 4 relationship between the intensity of fluorescent components protein characteristics and sludge dewaterability the potential relationships between fluorescent components and the molecular structure of proteinaceous compounds in s epss were evaluated through pearson s correlation analysis fig 7 a the fluorescence intensities of aromatic protein and tryptophan protein like substances showed a significant positive correlation with the protein secondary structure of α helix r 0 557 p 0 05 r 0 542 p 0 05 respectively and with the α helix β sheet random coil ratio r 0 573 p 0 01 r 0 657 p 0 01 respectively this confirms that the complexing of aromatic protein and tryptophan protein like with ta by hydrophobic binding facilitated the destruction of the protein secondary structure these results agree with a previous study on polyphenol amyloid interactions in which polyphenol molecules induced the conformational change of protein molecules and pushed the β sheet apart resulting in the formation of a loose structure berhanu and masunov 2015 furthermore the fluorescence intensities of tryptophan protein like substances showed a strong positive correlation with the hmw protein concentration r 0 741 p 0 01 and aromatic protein showed a strong and negative correlation with the concentration of lmw neutrals r 0 643 p 0 01 the occurrence of hmw proteins impairs sludge dewaterability because of their gel like network structure and strong hydrophilicity liu et al 2016 the lmw neutrals were mainly composed of mono oligosaccharides alcohols and aldehydes which represent the truly hydrophobic fraction these results further emphasize that the improved sludge hydrophobicity was strongly associated with the binding capacity of ta with hmw protein structural equation models were applied to further investigate the direct and indirect correlations between relative hydrophobicity and sludge dewaterability the concentration of fluorescent components and the molecular weight and secondary structure of s eps proteins fig 7c and d the aromatic protein and tryptophan protein like substances indirectly affected the sludge hydrophobicity and dewaterability the four effect pathways are as follows aromatic protein tryptophan like protein like substances α helix δgadh srf aromatic protein tryptophan like protein like substances α helix α helix β sheet random coil δgadh srf aromatic protein tryptophan like protein like substances α helix α helix β sheet random coil hmw protein δgadh srf and tryptophan like protein like hmw protein δgadh srf these results suggest that the effects of ta conditioning on rs and ht sludge dewaterability were mainly related to the destruction of protein structure and reduction of molecular weight during binding and protein precipitation with ta thus more efforts should be focused on protein structure destruction and hmw protein removal to upgrading the ta aided ht process according to the above analyses the mechanism through which ta improves sludge dewaterability and eps ta interaction mode at different ht temperatures was deduced fig 8 3 5 energy and economic evaluation to comprehensively evaluate the financial and environmental feasibility of the ta aided ht process the energy and economic analyses of different sludge deep dewatering processes ht ta aided ht and thermal drying treatment were conducted the corresponding results are summarized in table s10 in this study the labor cost and infrastructure cost are not considered according to previously reported and the experimental results in this study the moisture content of dewatered sludge cake is assumed about 50 which produced by different sludge deep dewatering processes under optimal conditions respectively it clearly shows that ht and ta aided ht processes could save more energy which only 42 1 and 36 3 of total energy consumption of conventional thermal drying furthermore it should be noted that this calculation was not considered the steam generated from the pressure relief process after ht therefore the energy consumption of ht and ta aided ht processes could be further reduced in practicality by recovering the energy from the treatment system for the economic costs of different processes the ht and ta aided ht processes have lower economic costs than thermal drying treatment while the economic costs of ta aided ht process is higher than that of ht process by 25 11 which mainly attributed to the consumption of ta however it is noteworthy to mention that the addition of ta not only avoids the formation of refractory matters but also removals 47 27 of total nitrogen in dewatering filtrates as previously reported the economic costs of treating wastewater with high nitrogen concentrations is 21 38 5 yuan kg nh4 n through biological treatment janus and van der roest 1997 moreover the substances like phenols and furfural produced at higher ht temperature 180 had a superimposed inhibition for microbial activity which would reduce nitrogen removal efficiency during filtrate treatment chen et al 2019 thus although there is a chemical cost the ta aided ht process has a significant advantage over the conventional ht process in terms of economic benefit from the treatment of dewatered filtrates in addition the environmental risk of dewatered sludge produced by ta aided ht process is significantly lower than that treated by traditional ht and inorganic coagulants since ta is a natural biodegradable organic matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs in ht sludge increased gradually with increasing ht temperature at carbonization stage 180 gong et al 2018 this result implied that the dewatered sludge produced by ta aided ht process has a better prospect for land application furthermore in this study the establishment of mechanism through which ta improves sludge dewaterability and removals the nitrogen in filtrates at different ht temperatures are conducive to upgrading ta aided ht process for engineering applications 4 conclusions in this study ta aided ht was used to simultaneously improve sludge dewatering and reduce the nitrogen concentration of the filtrate ta addition facilitated the dewaterability of rs and ht sludge at all investigated ht temperatures by improving the sludge relative hydrophobicity consequently the effective ht temperature was reduced from 180 to 160 moreover the efficiency of s eps protein removal by ta considerably increased with the ht temperature the changes in the protein secondary structure and the interaction of ta and hmw protein in s epss remarkably improved sludge dewaterability however the mechanisms of the ta aided ht in the different ht stages were different in the solubilization stage 120 the solubilization of proteins with numerous hydrophilic functional groups hydroxy and carboxyl endowed s epss with more binding sites for hydrogen bonding with ta and therefore a looser structure was formed at higher ht temperatures the s eps proteins were hydrolyzed and their secondary structures unfolded thereby exposing more sites for hydrophobic binding with ta moreover the ta protein interaction was more stable and spontaneous and protein precipitation and complexation was enhanced thus the molecular structure of protein was a key factor influencing the binding capacity and interaction mode between ta and sludge eps this work can serve as a basis for further studies on more efficient ta

16072,forms of organic contaminants is an important driver of bioavailable fraction and desorption kinetics of pollutants binding to sediments to determine fluxes and resupply of nine environmentally relevant antipsychotic drugs which are emerging pollutants that can have adverse effects on aquatic organisms interface passive samplers of diffusive gradients in thin films dgt were deployed for 21 days in situ at the sediment water interface in submerged sandy riverbank sediments at each deployment time samples of sediment were collected and subjected to consecutive extraction of pore water as well as rapidly desorbing labile stable desorbing and bound residue fractions concentrations of antipsychotic drugs decreased with sediment depth with the greatest concentrations observed in the top 2 cm positive fluxes of antipsychotic drugs were observed from sediment to surface water the dynamic fraction transfer model indicated that the labile fraction can be resupplied with a lag time 21 d when results were further interpreted using the dgt induced fluxes in soils and sediments difs model partial resupply of antipsychotic drugs from sediment particles to porewater was demonstrated desorption occurred within the entirety of the observed 15 cm depth of sediment fastest rates of resupply were found for carbamazepine and lamotrigine size of the labile pool estimated by the difs model did not fully explain the observed resupply while a first order three compartment kinetic model for the fast desorbing fraction can be used to supplement difs predictions with estimations of

introduction in aquatic ecosystems sediments can act as both sinks and sources of pollutants some micropollutants are transported in the water column adsorbed to organic particles which will ultimately be deposited during periods of lesser flow to bottom sediments megahan 1999 some organic pollutants sequestered in sediments are not prone to rapid biodegradation and can be accumulated into benthic organisms zhao et al 2009 fates of organic compounds deposited in sediments depends on their net fluxes at the sediment water interface fractions of organic compounds desorbed from sediment to water are largely controlled by processes of exchange between aqueous and solid phases within sediment bondarenko and gan 2004 an advective flux can be induced when concentrations of compounds in the solution phase are depleted and a resupply to the solution phase occurs from the adsorbed fraction this is based on the capacity of remobilization and the rate of desorption of chemicals from the solid phase generally fluxes via molecular diffusion is driven by the concentration gradient between sediment porewater and overlying bulk water through a diffusion limiting boundary layer which is formed at the sediment water interface eek et al 2010 the flux can be estimated by use of passive sampling approaches that can pre concentrate trace chemicals through non disruptive in situ sampling alvarez et al 2004 a recently developed diffusive gradient in thin films dgt technique is able to measure freely dissolved compounds fernandez et al 2009 and has been used for invesigating organic contaminants in sediments li et al 2021 mechelke et al 2019 dgt can be used as a dynamic tool for measuring labile concentrations which are fractions of chemicals that can be easily dissociated and resupplied to the porewater and its resupply capacity from the solid phase iuele et al 2021 a numerical model known as dgt induced fluxes in soil and sediments difs which can be formulated in various dimensionalities 1d 2d 3d difs harper et al 2000 sochaczewski et al 2007 was developed to simulate dgt adsorption and describe analyte resupply kinetics from solid phases the difs model was first applied to quantify desorption kinetics and labile pools of pesticides in intact sediment cores in the laboratory controlled conditions li et al 2021 however other influences such as resuspension desorption eek et al 2010 and bioirrigation by suction of overlaying water by benthic organisms through their burrows benoit et al 2009 can affect the observed net fluxes because sediment can be a heterogeneous matrix organic pollutants can exist in various fractions which can influence kinetics of desorption it has been reported that partitioning influences distributions of organic pollutants in sediments demars et al 1995 he et al 2016 although most studies considered the distribution of pollutants between solid fractions and interstitial water within sediments the binding mechanisms and intensities established between particles and pollutants can be complex demars et al 1995 three fractions of organic pollutants in sediments have been widely recognized i the fast desorbing fraction is weakly and reversibly bound to sediments and can rapidly desorb into the interstitial water semple et al 2004 ii the stable desorbing fraction can be described as a reversibly bound but slow desorbing fraction schwab and brack 2007 and iii the non extractable phase which is covalently bound to or sequestrated by organic matter in sediments schäffer et al 2018 and has been defined as bound residues by the international union of pure and applied chemistry roberts 1984 when xenobiotics enter sediments they can undergo transfer as well due to the wide range of structural units and functional groups present in organic macromolecules hayes and swift 1978 therefore organic pollutants can be stored as bound residue form in sediments where they might not appear to be hazardous in the short term but might be released when a sudden alternations of environment occur supplementary material supplementary fig s1 this phenomenon has been defined as a chemical time bomb stigliani 1991 this fraction of organic pollutants can be a potential source for re supply to the aqueous phase however to date there are no in situ studies of kinetics of desorption in sediments that have considered these three fractions the current difs model only considers the single labile pool size that is based on initial sediment solution concentration menezes blackburn et al 2019 however resupply to the labile pool needs to consider rates of transfer between various binding forms and equilibrium of labile analytes reached by a kenetic model which might provide additional information on kinetic processes in sediments and help describe the flux between sediment and water in aquatic systems to address these uncertainties and resolve gaps in data the objectives of this study were to i obtain time resolved field measurements for nine selected antipsychotic pharmaceuticals ii study the sorption phase for these compounds from water to sediments using dgt devices iii investigate and model desorption rates from the fractions transfer in sediments and compare measurements to values predicted by the difs model 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals nine high purity 98

because it is 20 km downstream of the city of saskatoon s wastewater treatment plant and in close proximity of the laboratory so that dgt devices and samples can be obtained and transported quickly

thickness 3 18 cm width 3 18 cm length 183 cm three separate profiles with attached samplers were slowly inserted into sediments with 2 cm of the probe board exposed out of sediments 15 cm was put into the sediment and were supported by three cement blocks height 19 cm width 27 cm for protection the setup is presented in fig 1 dgt devices were deployed and replaced after 1 3 6 9 12 15 and 21 d meanwhile three sediment cores adjacent to the dgt probes were sampled using a pvc sampling tube length 15 cm diameter 2 cm one additional sample of sediment was taken by use of a small shovel for the determination of matrix effects on extraction and concentration recoveries once the dgt devices were retrieved remaining sediment particles on probes and samplers were washed away using milli q water placed into sealed bags and wrapped with aluminum foil sediment cores were stored in a cooler with ice bags after installation of new dgt devices retrieved dgt devices and sampled sediments were immediately transported to the laboratory toxicology center university of saskatchewan where the binding gels were carefully removed and placed into amber glass vials wet sediment cores were immediately drained for 2 h to determine maximum water holding capacity priha and smolander 1999 then sediment cores were sliced into 2 cm intervals and each slice was centrifuged at 1280 g for 40 min to obtain sediment porewater that was filtered through a 0 20 µm membrane filter 13 mm diameter millex gn nylon membrane hydrophilic milliporesigma oakville on and then concentrated by solid phase

the porewater sediments were transferred to a freezer 20 c for 24 h and lyophilized dura dry mp fd2085 stone ridge ny the triplicates of a 5 g aliquot of sediment at different sampling times were transferred to lysing matrix e 50 ml tubes fisher scientific for sequential extraction fig 2 the fast desorbing fraction stable desorbing fraction and bound residue fraction of antipsychotic drugs log

desorbing fraction the fast desorbing fraction is defined as a consecutive desorption with time which can be represented by single point extraction methods muijs and jonker 2011 a single point extraction by methanol was used in this study and extraction time was determined by a consecutive extraction using a first order three compartment kinetic model details shown in section s4 in order to conduct consecutive extraction 5 g of lyophilized sediment were extracted using 5 ml methanol in a shaker 1500 rpm heidolph multi reax vortex mixer fisher scientific five milligrams of sodium azide

sampled methanol was passed through a 0 2 µm ptfe membrane filter after addition of internal standards and concentrated to 1 ml for instrumental analysis 2 5 2 2 stable desorbing fraction the stable desorbing fractions of antipsychotic drugs were extracted three times with 10 ml methanol dichloromethane 1 1 v v with ultrasound fig 2 after centrifugation the combined extracts were passed through a 0 2 µm ptfe membrane filter followed by spe concentration procedure section s3 before instrumental analysis 2 5 2 3 bound residue fraction alkaline hydrolysis has been widely used for the dissolution of organic matter which in turn releases non extractable organic pollutants which are sequestrated or occluded with organic matter in soils and sediments this method was adopted in the present study to extract the bound residue fraction of antipsychotic drugs in sediments residual sediments from previous ultrasonic extractions were added to 5 ml of 1 m naoh solution and then heated at 80 c for 8 h after cooling the samples were lyophilized and extracted using the same procedure as the stable desorbing fraction in order to test whether high temperature or hydrolysis would influence the analytes the mixture of nine antipsychotic drugs was spiked in 10 ml of 1 m naoh solutions to reach the concentration of 1 10 and 100 µg l 1 and heated at 80 c for 8 h after cooling the solutions were processed following the previously described spe procedure 2 6 determination of agarose diffusion coefficient to determine efficiency for deriving diffusion coefficients d for the nine analytes two major methods were compared the diffusion cell method westrin et al 1994 and the slice stacking method rusina et al 2010 both methods were conducted in an environmental chamber at a temperature of 25 c the diffusion coefficient of analytes in water d w was further estimated by the hayduk laudie equation hayduk and laudie 1974 the diffusion cell method is based on the analytes passing through a membrane from one water cell to another supplementary fig s4a each cell made of clear acrylic held ca 50 ml and had a 2 3 cm2 circular connecting window a diffusive gel was placed on the window a spacer was made based on the gel thickness between the two cells and gently sealed together with clamps each cell had a total volume of 40 ml to each cell 20 ml of 10 mm nacl was added followed by a spike of the 9 analyte stock mixture 1000 µg l 1 prepared in 5 methanol into the source cell at a target concentration of 500 µg l 1 meanwhile 20 ml of 5 methanol spike was added to the receiving cell both cells were stirred gently on stir plates triplicate samples 200 µl were taken from the receiving cell and source cell at ten different time points spread out over the experimental duration 5 to 140 min samples were pipetted directly into lc vials and before instrumental analysis external standardization was applied for these experiments due to no extraction processes the slice stacking method is based on analytes diffusing through several layers of gels supplementary fig s4b sixteen agarose gels were spiked by immersing them in 50 ml spiked at a concentration of 500 µg l 1 of the nine antipsychotic drugs for 24 h afterwards 10 spiked gels were removed and capped with 7 unspiked gels on a glass plate wrapped with aluminum foil the remaining gels were taken as blank for measuring the initial analyte concentrations the exposure time was selected as 60 90 and 120 min after exposure the stacks were disassembled and each gel was extracted with the same method of extraction used for binding gels chapter 2 5 2 1 calculation of d values for the both methods and different temperature are detailed in section s5 2 7 calculation of dgt derived parameters binding layers in dgt functions as a sink for compounds in the sediment porewater water where an induced flux from the sediment water passes through the diffusive layer and is bound in the binding layer for sediments the mangitude of this flux can be measured through interfacial concentration which is determined by the desorption kinetics between the adsorption of solute induced by the dgt probe and the capability to resupply solute from the sediment solid phase to the probe interface the time averaged interfacial concentration of dissolved compounds at each deployment time c dgt i can be calculated eq 1 zhang and davison 1995 1 c d g t i m i δ t o t a l d m i a e t i where mi is the accumulated mass of analyte in the binding gel at deployment time i t i δ total is the total thickness of the diffusive layer it includes the 0 15 mm pes filter membrane and the 0 75 mm agarose diffusive gel d m i is the mean temperature adapted diffusion coefficient of each analyte at each deployment time i

the r value meets the partial case 0 1 r 0 95 in which some resupply from the solid phase but inadequate to maintain the initial c p i harper et al 1998 the calculation of diffusion between sediment and water is shown in section s6 2 8 numerical modeling of dgt deployments using difs the 2d 3d difs model developed by sochaczewski et al 2007 simulates dgt induced fluxes from soil or sediments in consideration of solute diffusion within two dimensions and incorporation of essential model calibrations although 2d difs considers the domain as the partial cross section along the axis perpendicular to the diffusive gel interface of which the origin is situated at the center the 2d model was shown to be a good approximation of the full 3d model sochaczewski et al 2007 therefore in the study results of which are presented here the 2d framework was employed the parameters describing desorption kinetics of dissolved organic compounds between solid and solution phases were identical to other studies previously employed in soils or sediments chen et al 2015 li et al 2021 ren et al 2020 the difs model describes the dynamics of dissolved analytes c p and the labile

model was reached concentration of antipsychotic drugs in sediment porewater cp at each deployment time was described in chapter 2 4 calculation of the labile phase pool is shown in section s7 2 9 instrumental analysis quantifications of nine analytes from all reconstituted samples in methanol was conducted using a vanquish uhplc and q exactive hf quadrupole orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer thermo fisher mississauga on analytical details are presented in sm section s5 2 10 data analysis statistical analyses were conducted in ibm spss statistics 26 data obtained from dgt devices and the consecutive extraction method were checked for normality and homogeneity of variance using levene s test since the data did not meet normality criteria and did not show homogeneous variances non parametric kruskal wallis tests and spearman s correlation significant at p 0 05 were used for comparison and correlation among samples the desorbing fraction transfer was calculated using matlab r2019b 3 results and discussions 3 1 dgt performance the nine target antisphycotic compounds were tested for adsorption to dgt materials adsorption capability of the binding gel and the maximum exposure time for dgt sampling steady state sorption concentrations of the nine antipsychotics were quickly reached 0 5 h for dgt molding and diffusive gel concentrations remained consistent for 168 h with a negligible fraction 0 01 total mass of the standard solution adsorbed to dgt moldings both ptfe and abs and diffusive gels concentrations of all compounds on the pes filter membrane increased within an hour and reached steady state sorption within 2 h proportions of analytes sorbed were negligible 1 of the total mass of the standard solution for all durations adsorption of the nine analytes to sepra zt binding gel was rapid within four hours and became slower as it reached steady state and the available surface binding sites became saturated supplementary fig s6 to quantify adsorption capacity of a sepratm zt binding gel for the analytes from a given solution amounts of each analyte adsorbed by sepratm zt binding gel vs the original concentration of each analyte in the solution were plotted supplementary fig s7 an increasing trend of the adsorbed amount with solute concentration was observed for all nine compounds ranging from 200 to 2000 µg l 1 without a significant deviation from linearity at a solute concentration of 5000 µg l 1 the amounts adsorbed were not significantly different from that at 2000 µg l 1 which indicated that binding sites of the sepra zt adsorbents were saturated in order to guarantee the dgt device does not approach equilibrium and to estimate the maximum permissible exposure time for comprehensive sampling the sorption isotherm of analytes between the measured concentration sorbed by sepra zt c sorbed and that in water c w can be described by the distribution constant which can be calculated by fitting the measured concentrations to the linear sorption model c s o r b e d k s e p r a z t c w the correlation coefficients in the linear sorption model are good for most compounds table 1 whereas the compounds with lesser correlation coefficients r 2 require more complex sorption models i e freundlich and langmuir to better predict the measured data bäuerlein et al 2012 belles et al 2017 recommended that it is appropriate to use an adapted linear model to evaluate the sampler s equilibrium for comprehensive sampling the dgt devices should be far from the equilibrium at all sampling times and hence the ratio csorbed cw should be less than the ksepra zt values which can be combined with eq 1 and shown as 8 t max m e a s u r e d t max e s t i m a t e d k s e p r a z t δ t o t a l d a where t max measured and t max estimated is measured and estimated maximum exposure time to achieve k sepra zt respectively our results showed the exposure time for each compound was more than 100 times less than the threshold which indicates the device remained far from equilibrium conditions at all times 3 2 diffusion coefficient diffusion coefficients at 25 c of the nine antipsychotic drugs determined using the diffusion cell method and the slice stacking method are shown table 1 d cell and d stack values were not significantly different p 0 05 for any of the compounds through comparison of triplicate measurements for the diffusion cell method the variables from eq s7 were linearly correlated r2 0 988 0 998 with experimental time supplementary fig s8 mean d cell values for the studied antipsychotic drugs ranged from 3 63 to 7 20 10 6 cm2 s 1 while d stack values ranged from 4 34 to 5 44 10 6 cm2 s 1 no statistically significant correlations between d and molecular mass of compounds were observed which might have resulted from the narrow molecular mass range of these compounds 236 27 326 80 da this result is consistent with those of previous studies urík et al 2020 for perfluoroalkyl compounds pharmaceuticals and personal care products with a range of molecular masses of 151 to 377 da and for polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with molecular masses in the range of 128 2 to 429 8 da rusina et al 2010 the d cell for carbamazepine 5 54 10 6 cm2 s 1 fluoxetine 4 72 10 6 cm2 s 1 and bupropion 4 48 10 6 cm2 s 1 determined during this study were similar to previously reported values in 1 5 agarose hydrogel with d values of 5 01 10 6 4 38 10 6 5 21 10 6 cm2 s 1 for carbamazepine fluoxetine and bupropion respectively challis et al 2016 fang et al 2019 the d stack for carbamazepine 4 55 10 6 cm2 s 1 was comparably less than the value 5 33 10 6 cm2 s 1 reported by urík et al 2020 three compounds e g venlafaxine duloxetine and amitriptyline log k ow 3 28 4 68 and 4 95 respectively failed to measure by the slice stacking method despite different experimental design of two methods d value derived from the diffusion cell method is simply depended on logarithmic linearization however the slice stacking method requires extraction and concentration procedures causing more uncertainty on the analytical processes the relative error values in our study for both methods were derived from the model regression fitting to the data the previous example for estimating the rising uncertainty of d value for copper in dgt sampler was negligible for these factors e g ph and ionic strength in comparison to the estimated diffusion area and analytical processes nevertheless since slight differences between the two methods the d values measured using the diffusion cell method was used for calculation dgt derived concentrations in this study 3 3 dgt fluxes of antipsychotic drugs in sediment when concentrations of antipsychotic drugs were averaged by day in water and sediment a declining trend of concentrations in the water column 8 2 cm and a similar decreasing trend in vertical scale of sediment porewater was observed except for lamotrigine and bupropion with the greatest concentrations at a depth of 2 to 4 cm fig 3 this result is consistent with previous observations that increasing dissolved concentrations of organic compounds were found in closer proximity to the sediment fernandez et al 2012 grimalt et al 2001 however for most compounds except for lamotrigine and bupropion concentrations in sediment porewater generally remained unchanged p 0 05 at depths below 2 cm concentrations between water and porewater remained within the same order of magnitude for lamotrigine bupropion and carbamazepine while concentrations of other compounds in sediment porewater were approximately 10 fold less than those in the water column the greatest concentration at 8 cm in water was for carbamazepine 15 73 2 14 µg l 1 which was greater than at 6 cm 9 58 1 30 µg l 1 and 2 cm 0 54 0 08 µg l 1 the greatest mean concentrations among water matrix samples were observed for carbamazepine 8 61 µg l 1 followed by duloxetine amitriptyline and citalopram 4 30 8 16 µg l 1 venlafaxine was observed at significantly lesser mean concentrations in both water 0 077 µg l 1 and sediment 0 009 µg l 1 because dgt devices are time weighted temporal variability of water concentrations diffusing laterally could not be measured therefore constant concentrations close to the water sediment interface were assumed for calculating diffusive fluxes nevertheless fluxes were normalized per day which showed net positive fluxes towards water from sediment fig 3 overall lesser fluxes 0 0012 0 089 ng cm 2 d 1 were observed for lamotrigine bupropion venlafaxine and duloxetine while citalopram 0 10 ng cm 2 d 1 and fluoxetine 0 14 ng cm 2 d 1 had similar fluxes the greatest flux was found for carbamazepine indicating that sediment borne carbamazepine has potential resupply ability to porewater and is prone to partition back to water at the water sediment interface 3 4 three adsorbing fractions of antipsychotic drugs 3 4 1 fast desorbing fraction the plot of st s0 versus extraction time for desorption of antipsychotic drugs in sediments sampled at day 1 and day 21 during the dgt deployment period is shown in fig 4 where the solid line derived from exponential curve fitting by eq s1 in section s4 the kinetic parameters obtained from eq s1 are shown in table s5 desorption of antipsychotic compounds decreased with increasing the deployment time mean desorptions of all compounds in sediment were approximately 21 2 3 for day 1 and 10 1 2 for day 21 the fr values decreased from 0 249 to 0 184 for amitriptyline 0 403 to 0 331 for bupropion 0 409 to 0 355 for carbamazepine 0 261 to 0 127 for citalopram 0 298 to 0 236 for clozapine 0 198 to 0 147 for duloxetine 0 320 to 0 275 for fluoxetine 0 411 to 0 329 for lamotrigine and 0 120 to 0 098 for venlafaxine which indicated that the labile fraction of these compounds decreased in sediments constants k rapid and k slow ranged from 10 1 to 10 2 h 1 and k sv ranged from 10 5 to 10 6 h 1 table s6 which is comparable to the magnitude of these parameters from previous labile fraction kinetic studies cheng et al 2019 trimble et al 2008 you et al 2007 the greatest k rapid values both at day 1 and day 21 were found for carbamazepine 0 517 and 0 367 h 1 and lamotrigine 0 531 to 0 383 h 1 while the least values 0 032 and 0 016 h 1 were found for venlafaxine this result suggests that carbamazepine and lamotrigine could be resupplied from other fractions in sediments while venlafaxine was prone to remain in sediment particles which might be associated with the ionic interactions of these compounds e g lamotrigine and carbamazepine navon et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 and the potential pool size of compound in sediment despite fr values of all compounds being stable within 24 h extraction period variations in nonlinear sorption might influence the magnitude ten hulscher et al 1999 the ratios of f24h to fr in sediments at day 1 and day 21 showed that the ratio ranged from 77 to 93 table s6 this suggests that a single extraction by methanol for 24 h is sufficient to represent the rapidly desorbing fraction of these drugs these findings are similar to previous results that equilibrium of fr could be reached in a short time 10 h during laboratory simulation with a positive linear regression between fr and f10h cheng et al 2019 3 4 2 stable desorbing fraction the trend of the concentration in sediments extracted following that of the rapidly desorbing fraction at each deployment time showed that a slight decreasing concentrations with deployment time were observed for most compounds whereas duloxetine showed a slightly declining concentration at day 21 supplementary fig s9 and table s7 the most significant extent of concentration increase was found for bupropion from 2 21 to 6 32 µg kg 1 and for fluoxetine from 0 73 to 1 43 µg kg 1 this result indicates the relative stable state for fraction transfer from stable desorbing fraction 3 4 3 bound residue fraction despite the hydrolysis method effectively releasing the bound residue fraction of organic compounds from sediments northcott and jones 2000 the uncertainty remains whether the hydrolysis processes or high temperature would influence the analytes and lead to inaccurate quantification for the accuracy and reliability of analysis results a single standard solution of each nine antipsychotic drugs was spiked in 10 ml of 1 m naoh solution at the target concentrations of 10 100 or 1000 µg l 1 at 80 c for 24 h to test whether the degradation occurred among nine antipsychotic drugs poor recoveries 30 were observed for bupropion and duloxetine while recoveries for other compounds were greater than 80 at all three concentrations this is consistent with previous observations that bupropion and duloxetine are not resistant to alkaline hydrolysis abbas et al 2012 rao et al 2010 therefore bupropion and duloxetine are not included in bound residue fraction discussion in comparison to concentration of stable desorbing fraction except for citalopram clozapine and fluoxetine having no significant changes p 0 05 the concentrations of other compounds showed apparent increases table s8 generally bound residue concentrations of antipsychotic drugs were increasing with sampling time 3 5 transfer of antipsychotic drugs in sediment during 21 sampling days the total measured portions of antipsychotic drugs not considering bupropion and duloxetine changed from 20 to 70 table s9 where total concentration was increased from 1 37 to 4 00 µg kg 1 for amitriptyline 0 46 to 1 28 µg kg 1 for carbamazepine 0 02 to 0 06 µg kg 1 for citalopram 1 60 to 1 99 µg kg 1 for fluoxetine 1 61 to 6 11 µg kg 1 for lamotrigine and 2 13 to 5 51 µg kg 1 for venlafaxine whereas an approximately 50 decrease was observed in clozapine from 1 83 to 0 94 µg kg 1 this suggests a continuous resupply of most selected compounds over time in the real environment while clozapine might experience a poor source pool and different mechanisms of degradation microbial degradation has been observed for several antipsychotic drugs carbamazepine oxazepam and codeine followed a lag period of about 1 day under laboratory simulation stein et al 2008 therefore we could not interpret whether degradation was due to biological processes or photodegradation in real matrices however our results demonstrated the certain levels of antipsychotic drugs persist in surface sediments the labile stable adsorbing and bound residue fractions of antipsychotic in sediments is presented in fig 5 calculated as the of the total concentrations of three fractions this can reflect the resupply ability of compounds to labile fraction the percentage of labile fraction of antipsychotic drugs all declined with the sampling time suggesting that the potential bioavailability of these drugs declined this decline only reflected the static state distribution of these compounds in sediments however while bound residue or stable desorbing fraction increased indicating a risk for fraction transfer to further influence the desorption rate of compounds from sediments to aqueous phase the relatively slow declines were observed within 6 days which might be inferred that some competition in sorption sites for different compounds and these compounds might be easier to diffuse to sediment porewater rather than sorption sites with increasing of sampling time the gradual decrease of labile fraction could be caused by organic sequestration clay sorption and diffusion to sediment micropores the stable adsorbing fraction of antipsychotic drugs showed decreases over time for amitriptyline 8 to 5 carbamazepine 29 to 15 lamotrigine 27 to 14 and venlafaxine 46 to 19 increases for citalopram 43 to 50 clozapine 17 to 50 and fluoxetine 48 to 72 this difference for different compounds might due to the intensity of binding forces or sequestration through the transfer from stable desorbing fraction to bound reside fraction the bound residue fraction of antipsychotic drugs from 1 to 21 d ranged from 61 to 81 for amitriptyline 39 to 71 for carbamazepine 33 to 37 for citalopram 42 to 65 for lamotrigine 41 to 75 for venlafaxine 62 to 39 for clozapine and 26 to 16 for fluoxetine despite the bound residue fraction is generally accompanied by the other two fractions increasing bound residue fraction here for majority of compounds was not directly to the increase of labile fraction especially for 1 to 6 d this observation is based on the solid sediment capacity of solutes cornelissen et al 1997 weber and huang 1996 which is the fraction for some compounds clozapine and fluoxetine could not firmly adsorb onto sediment particle surface and the occurrence of channels and nanopores for sandy texture led to slow diffusion into internal sediment matrix where organic compounds could be eventually retained generally results reported here indicate that bound residue fraction of antipsychotic drugs can be an important resupply source for transfer to labile fraction that is continuously increased with sampling days when a previously developed mathematical model cheng et al 2019 was used to simulate the processes of three fractions transfer over sampling time without considering degradation conditions supplementary fig s10 eq 9 11 9 d c l a b i l e d t

for antipsychotic drugs ksb and kbs represent the rate coefficients partitioning between stable desorbing and bound residue fractions for antipsychotic drugs the detailed computation processes of the model are shown in section s9 the good correlation for model fitting r 2 0 915 0 993 for three different fractions was observed fig 6 the constant coefficients k were not constant during the sampling day and significantly different table 2 overall kfs is bigger than ksf from the first to last sampling day for all compounds implying these antipsychotic drugs were prone to retain in the sediment particle rather than sediment porewater at 21 d the increasing kfs values suggested that more antipsychotic drugs escaped from labile phase to stable desorbing fraction kfb and kbf standing for the ability of sequestrating of compounds in sediment particles and its antidromic release respectively were nearly 0 at day 1 indicating little labile fraction transferred to bound residue fraction this result suggested that antipsychotic drugs had a lag time to be sorbed onto sediments at 21 d kfb increased for all drugs except for citalopram clozapine and fluoxetine showing these three drugs had been completely adsorbed by the adsorption sites of sediment particles and pool size for them might be limited as well the small values of kfb indicated that antipsychotic drugs were partitioned to organic matter and blocked to have a fraction transfer which is taken as the final fate for organic contaminant non bioavailability although kfb and kbf were much lower than the other k values the transfer between bound reside and stable desorbing fractions occurred before diffusion into sediment porewater the increased ksb and kbs for amitriptyline carbamazepine lamotrigine and venlafaxine could represent not irreversible processes whereas slightly decreased ksb was corresponding to the decreased values of kfb this could also reflect the dynamic processes in bound residue fraction where less antipsychotic drugs could be potentially released to some extent with accessibility to biota cheng et al 2019 xing et al 1996 3 6 resupply kinetics and labile size of antipsychotic drugs in sediment the r value represents the resupply of antipsychotic drugs from the sediment particles to porewater which responds to the depletion by dgt devices the r values in sediment depth of 2 15 cm ranged from 0 15 to 0 41 for carbamazepine 0 14 to 0 39 for lamotrigine 0 12 to 0 35 for bupropion 0 13 to 0 34 for fluoxetine 0 11 to 0 30 for citalopram 0 11 to 0 29 for clozapine 0 09 to 0 25 for amitriptyline 0 08 to 0 22 for duloxetine and 0 05 to 0 15 for venlafaxine when there was no supply from sediment but only diffusion to supply rdiff values derived from difs model varied 0 02 to 0 04 for all drugs therefore the sediment for all antipsychotic drugs has ability to supply the positive fluxes from solid phase to sediment solution in general r values decreased gradually with deployment time and also with depth supplementary fig s11 and the differences of that between 8 and 15 cm were not significant p 0 05 for all drugs indicating the resupply ability decreased with the depth and resupply could not be quickly provided during the time interval of dgt deployment in real conditions additionally the largest r values were found for carbamazepine and lamotrigine while venlafaxine showed the lowest value which is similar to the values of ksf and kbf indicting the low supply to sediment porewater for venlafaxine while carbamazepine and lamotrigine could be resupplied quicker the labile antipsychotic drugs in the solid phase could release during dgt deployment to supply those depleted by dgt from sediment solution the estimated pool size for antipsychotic drugs varied from 0 07 to 0 50 µg kg 1 table 3 using eq 12 the distribution coefficient k d calculated as the ratio of concentration of labile antipsychotic drugs the equilibrium reached concentration using consecutive extraction for fast desorbing fraction at 10 h to cp can be used to indicate the labile pool size in sediments our k d values 0 02 32 32 cm3 g 1 table 3 are within the ranges published 0 01 64 cm3 g 1 ben hur et al 2003 li et al 2021 ling et al 2005 payá pérez et al 1992 the order of average k d values is followed carbamazepine lamotrigine fluoxetine bupropion clozapine citalopram amitriptyline duloxetine venlafaxine interestngly our data showed k d declined with depth for all drugs except values for fluoxetine were close to 0 and the difference between k d and kdl was one order of magnitude while no significant decrease with depth was found in kdl this difference could be due to the solvent extraction to get the maximum compounds from the labile fraction and the loss for porewater taken over time e g evaporation and redistribution out of field condition however it is important that k d and r values can get the same results for resupply abilities by calculating labile pool size indicting k d can be a parameter to use for predicting magnitude of resupply for organic compounds considering the alkaline drugs the slightly decreasing ph and lower organic matter in our sediment had little influence on the adsorption additionally the response time tc and the desorption adsorption rate constant k 1 k 1 at different depths table 3 showed that the greatest values were found at 2 cm demonstrating the top layer has the fastest resupply ten fold greater k 1 values than k 1 values for all drugs were found indicating the desorption processes were dominant within 2 15 cm depth as the investigated sediment was in a neutral ph environment the measured antipsychotic drugs remained in their neutral form with adsorption mainly through van der waals forces or hydrogen bonding which might be related to the dissolved organic matter for controlling the fraction transfer resupply kinetic characteristics and labile pool size 4 conclusion this study used in situ deployed dgt devices in water and sediment in field during 21 days our results showed positive fluxes of nine antipsychotic drugs from sediment to water processes were controlled by the resupply capability from solid phase to sediment porewater although raplidly desorbing labile fractions declined during 21 days the constant coefficients of antipsychotic drugs could be supplied to labile phase quickly from the stable desorbing and bound residue fractions with a lag time the quickest transfer rate to labile fraction was found for amitriptyline and carbamazepine and the slowest for venlafaxine which has been also verified by r ratio response time and desorption rate constant obtained from difs model the estimated labile pool size from difs might not be the best way to reflect the real status while the labile pool size calculated at equilibrium from a first order three compartment kinetic model could fit the changes of r values well we propose that this could be an auxiliary parameter to understand

16072,forms of organic contaminants is an important driver of bioavailable fraction and desorption kinetics of pollutants binding to sediments to determine fluxes and resupply of nine environmentally relevant antipsychotic drugs which are emerging pollutants that can have adverse effects on aquatic organisms interface passive samplers of diffusive gradients in thin films dgt were deployed for 21 days in situ at the sediment water interface in submerged sandy riverbank sediments at each deployment time samples of sediment were collected and subjected to consecutive extraction of pore water as well as rapidly desorbing labile stable desorbing and bound residue fractions concentrations of antipsychotic drugs decreased with sediment depth with the greatest concentrations observed in the top 2 cm positive fluxes of antipsychotic drugs were observed from sediment to surface water the dynamic fraction transfer model indicated that the labile fraction can be resupplied with a lag time 21 d when results were further interpreted using the dgt induced fluxes in soils and sediments difs model partial resupply of antipsychotic drugs from sediment particles to porewater was demonstrated desorption occurred within the entirety of the observed 15 cm depth of sediment fastest rates of resupply were found for carbamazepine and lamotrigine size of the labile pool estimated by the difs

introduction in aquatic ecosystems sediments can act as both sinks and sources of pollutants some micropollutants are transported in the water column adsorbed to organic particles which will ultimately be deposited during periods of lesser flow to bottom sediments megahan 1999 some organic pollutants sequestered in sediments are not prone to rapid biodegradation and can be accumulated into benthic organisms zhao et al 2009 fates of organic compounds deposited in sediments depends on their net fluxes at the sediment water interface fractions of organic compounds desorbed from sediment to water are largely controlled by processes of exchange between aqueous and solid phases within sediment bondarenko and gan 2004 an advective flux can be induced when concentrations of compounds in the solution phase are depleted and a resupply to the solution phase occurs from the adsorbed fraction this is based on the capacity of remobilization and the rate of desorption of chemicals from the solid phase generally fluxes via molecular diffusion is driven by the concentration gradient between sediment porewater and overlying bulk water through a diffusion limiting boundary layer which is formed at the sediment water interface eek et al 2010 the flux can be estimated by use of passive sampling approaches that can pre concentrate trace chemicals through non disruptive in situ sampling alvarez et al 2004 a recently developed diffusive gradient in thin films dgt technique is able to measure freely dissolved compounds fernandez et al 2009 and has been used for invesigating organic contaminants in sediments li et al 2021 mechelke et al 2019 dgt can be used as a dynamic tool for measuring labile concentrations which are fractions of chemicals that can be easily dissociated and resupplied to the porewater and its resupply capacity from the solid phase iuele et al 2021 a numerical model known as dgt induced fluxes in soil and sediments difs which can be formulated in various dimensionalities 1d 2d 3d difs harper et al 2000 sochaczewski et al 2007 was developed to simulate dgt adsorption and describe analyte resupply kinetics from solid phases the difs model was first applied to quantify desorption kinetics and labile pools of pesticides in intact sediment cores in the laboratory controlled conditions li et al 2021 however other influences such as resuspension desorption eek et al 2010 and bioirrigation by suction of overlaying water by benthic organisms through their burrows benoit et al 2009 can affect the observed net fluxes because sediment can be a heterogeneous matrix organic pollutants can exist in various fractions which can influence kinetics of desorption it has been reported that partitioning influences distributions of organic pollutants in sediments demars et al 1995 he et al 2016 although most studies considered the distribution of pollutants between solid fractions and interstitial water within sediments the binding mechanisms and intensities established between particles and pollutants can be complex demars et al 1995 three fractions of organic pollutants in sediments have been widely recognized i the fast desorbing fraction is weakly and reversibly bound to sediments and can rapidly desorb into the interstitial water semple et al 2004 ii the stable desorbing fraction can be described as a reversibly bound but slow desorbing fraction schwab and brack 2007 and iii the non extractable phase which is covalently bound to or sequestrated by organic matter in sediments schäffer et al 2018 and has been defined as bound residues by the international union of pure and applied chemistry roberts 1984 when xenobiotics enter sediments they can undergo transfer as well due to the wide range of structural units and functional groups present in organic macromolecules hayes and swift 1978 therefore organic pollutants can be stored as bound residue form in sediments where they might not appear to be hazardous in the short term but might be released when a sudden alternations of environment occur supplementary material supplementary fig s1 this phenomenon has been defined as a chemical time bomb stigliani 1991 this fraction of organic pollutants can be a potential source for re supply to the aqueous phase however to date there are no in situ studies of kinetics of desorption in sediments that have considered these three fractions the current difs model only considers the single labile pool size that is based on initial sediment solution concentration menezes blackburn et al 2019 however resupply to the labile pool needs to consider rates of transfer between various binding forms and equilibrium of labile analytes reached by a kenetic model which might provide additional information on kinetic processes in sediments and help describe the flux between sediment and water in aquatic systems to address these uncertainties and resolve gaps in data the objectives of this study were to i obtain time resolved field measurements for nine selected antipsychotic pharmaceuticals ii study the sorption phase for these compounds from water to sediments using dgt devices iii

meanwhile three sediment cores adjacent to the dgt probes were sampled using a pvc sampling tube length 15 cm diameter 2 cm one additional sample of sediment was taken by use of a small shovel for the determination of matrix effects on extraction and concentration recoveries once the dgt devices were retrieved remaining sediment particles on probes and samplers were washed away using milli q water

immediately transported to the laboratory toxicology center university of saskatchewan where the binding gels were carefully removed and placed into amber glass vials wet sediment cores were immediately drained for 2 h to determine maximum water holding capacity priha and smolander 1999 then sediment cores were sliced into 2 cm intervals and each slice was centrifuged at 1280 g for 40 min

desorbing fraction the fast desorbing fraction is defined as a consecutive desorption with time which can be represented by single point extraction methods muijs and jonker 2011 a single point extraction by methanol was used in this study and extraction time was determined by a consecutive extraction using a first order three compartment kinetic model details shown in section s4 in order to conduct consecutive extraction 5 g of lyophilized sediment were extracted using 5 ml methanol in a shaker 1500 rpm heidolph multi reax vortex mixer fisher scientific five milligrams of sodium azide

sampled methanol was passed through a 0 2 µm ptfe membrane filter after addition of internal standards and concentrated to 1 ml for instrumental analysis 2 5 2 2 stable desorbing fraction the stable desorbing fractions of antipsychotic drugs were extracted three times with 10 ml methanol dichloromethane 1 1 v v with ultrasound fig 2 after centrifugation the combined extracts were passed through a 0 2 µm ptfe membrane filter followed by spe concentration procedure section s3 before instrumental analysis 2 5 2 3 bound residue fraction alkaline hydrolysis has been widely used for the dissolution of organic matter which in turn releases non extractable organic pollutants which are sequestrated or occluded with organic matter in soils and sediments this method was adopted in the present study to extract the bound residue fraction of antipsychotic drugs in sediments residual sediments from previous ultrasonic extractions were added to 5 ml of 1 m naoh solution and then heated at 80 c for 8 h after cooling the samples were lyophilized and extracted using the same procedure as the stable desorbing fraction in order to test whether high temperature or hydrolysis would influence the analytes the mixture of nine antipsychotic drugs was spiked in 10 ml of 1 m naoh solutions to reach the concentration of 1 10 and 100 µg l 1 and heated at 80 c for 8 h after cooling the solutions were processed following the previously described spe procedure 2 6 determination of agarose diffusion coefficient to determine efficiency for deriving diffusion coefficients d for the nine analytes two major methods were compared the diffusion cell method westrin et al 1994 and the slice stacking method rusina et al 2010 both methods were conducted in an environmental chamber at a temperature of 25 c the diffusion coefficient of analytes in water d w was further estimated by the hayduk laudie equation hayduk and laudie 1974 the diffusion cell method is based on the analytes passing through a membrane from one water cell to another supplementary fig s4a each cell made of clear acrylic held ca 50 ml and had a 2 3 cm2 circular connecting window a diffusive gel was placed on the window a spacer was made based on the gel thickness between the two cells and gently sealed together with clamps each cell had a total volume of 40 ml to each cell 20 ml of 10 mm nacl was added followed by a spike of the 9 analyte stock mixture 1000 µg l 1 prepared in 5 methanol into the source cell at a target concentration of 500 µg l 1 meanwhile 20 ml of 5 methanol spike was added to the receiving cell both cells were stirred gently on stir plates triplicate samples 200 µl were taken from the receiving cell and source cell at ten different time points spread out over the experimental duration 5 to 140 min samples were pipetted directly into lc vials and before instrumental analysis external standardization was applied for these experiments due to no extraction processes the slice stacking method is based on analytes diffusing through several layers of gels supplementary fig s4b sixteen agarose gels were spiked by immersing them in 50 ml spiked at a concentration of 500 µg l 1 of the nine antipsychotic drugs for 24 h afterwards 10 spiked gels were removed and capped with 7 unspiked gels on a glass plate wrapped with aluminum foil the remaining gels were taken as blank for measuring the initial analyte concentrations the exposure time was selected as 60 90 and 120 min after exposure the stacks were disassembled and each gel was extracted with the same method of extraction used for binding gels chapter 2 5 2 1 calculation of d values for the both methods and different temperature are detailed in section s5 2 7 calculation of dgt derived parameters binding layers in dgt functions as a sink for compounds in the sediment porewater water where an induced flux from the sediment water passes through the diffusive layer and is bound in the binding layer for sediments the mangitude of this flux can be measured through interfacial concentration which is determined by the desorption kinetics between the adsorption of solute induced by the dgt probe and the capability to resupply solute from the sediment solid phase to the probe interface the time averaged interfacial concentration of dissolved compounds at each deployment time c dgt i can be calculated

diffusive layer it includes the 0 15 mm pes filter membrane and the 0 75 mm agarose diffusive gel d m i is the mean temperature adapted diffusion coefficient of each analyte at each deployment time i and ae is the effective exposure window of dgt devices 3 14 cm2 for standard device and 30 66 cm2 for dgt probe an index of the magnitude of depletion of sediment porewater concentration to the device

the r value meets the partial case 0 1 r 0 95 in which some resupply from the solid phase but inadequate to maintain the initial c p i harper et al 1998 the calculation of diffusion between sediment and water is shown in section s6 2 8 numerical modeling of dgt deployments using difs the 2d 3d difs model developed by sochaczewski et al 2007 simulates dgt induced fluxes from soil or sediments in consideration of solute diffusion within two dimensions and incorporation of essential model calibrations although 2d difs considers the domain as the partial cross section along the axis perpendicular to the diffusive gel interface of which the origin is situated at the center the 2d model was shown to be a good approximation of the full 3d model sochaczewski et al 2007 therefore in the study results of which are presented here the 2d framework was employed the parameters describing desorption kinetics of dissolved organic compounds between solid and solution phases were identical to other studies previously employed in soils or sediments chen et al 2015 li et al 2021 ren et al 2020 the difs model describes the dynamics of dissolved analytes c p and the labile fraction associated with the solid phase c l along with the deployment time to fit first order exchange kinetics eq 3 3 c p k 1 k 1 c l where the rate constants at which the two fractions magnitudes change are defined as the rate constants of adsorption k 1 and desorption k 1 governed by the labile concentration of compounds and the particle concentration of sediment p c m v where m is the total

concentrations c l of antipsychotic drugs were determined by the method of fast desorbing fraction chapter 2 5 2 1 at the time at which the equilibrium of the first order three compartment kinetic model was reached concentration of antipsychotic drugs in sediment porewater cp at each deployment time was described in chapter 2 4 calculation of the labile phase pool is shown in section s7 2 9 instrumental analysis quantifications of nine analytes from all reconstituted samples in methanol was conducted using a vanquish uhplc and q exactive hf quadrupole orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer thermo fisher mississauga on analytical details are presented in sm section s5 2 10 data analysis statistical analyses were conducted in ibm spss statistics 26 data obtained from dgt devices and the consecutive extraction method were checked for normality and homogeneity of variance using levene s test since the data did not meet normality criteria and did not show homogeneous variances non parametric kruskal wallis tests and spearman s correlation significant at p 0 05 were used for comparison and correlation among samples the desorbing fraction transfer was calculated using matlab r2019b 3 results and discussions 3 1 dgt performance the nine target antisphycotic compounds were tested for adsorption to dgt materials adsorption capability of the binding gel and the maximum exposure time for dgt sampling steady state sorption concentrations of the nine antipsychotics were quickly reached 0 5 h for dgt molding and diffusive gel concentrations remained consistent for 168 h with a negligible fraction 0 01 total mass of the standard solution adsorbed to dgt moldings both ptfe and abs and diffusive gels concentrations of all compounds on the pes filter membrane increased within an hour and reached steady state sorption within 2 h proportions of analytes sorbed were negligible 1 of the total mass of the standard solution for all durations adsorption of the nine analytes to sepra zt binding gel was rapid within four hours and became slower as it reached steady state and the available surface binding sites became saturated supplementary fig s6 to quantify adsorption capacity of a sepratm zt binding gel for the analytes from a given solution amounts of each analyte adsorbed by sepratm zt binding gel vs the original concentration of each analyte in the solution were plotted supplementary fig s7 an increasing trend of the adsorbed amount with solute concentration was observed for all nine compounds ranging from 200 to 2000 µg l 1 without a significant deviation from linearity at a solute concentration of 5000 µg l 1 the amounts adsorbed were not significantly different from that at 2000 µg l 1 which indicated that binding sites of the sepra zt adsorbents were saturated in order to guarantee the dgt device does not approach equilibrium and to estimate the maximum permissible exposure time for comprehensive sampling the sorption isotherm of analytes between the measured concentration sorbed by sepra zt c sorbed and that in water c w can be described by the distribution constant which can be calculated by fitting the measured concentrations to the linear sorption model c s o r b e d k s e p r a z t c w the correlation coefficients in the linear sorption model are good for most compounds table 1 whereas the compounds with lesser correlation coefficients r 2 require more complex sorption models i e freundlich and langmuir to better predict the measured data bäuerlein et al 2012 belles et al 2017 recommended that it is appropriate to use an adapted linear model to evaluate the sampler s equilibrium for comprehensive sampling the dgt devices should be far from the equilibrium at all sampling times and hence the ratio csorbed cw should be less than the ksepra zt values which can be combined with eq 1 and shown as 8 t max m e a s u r e d t max e s t i m a t e d k s e p r a z t δ t o t a l d a where t max measured and t max estimated is measured and estimated maximum exposure time to achieve k sepra zt respectively our results showed the exposure time for each compound was more than 100 times less than the threshold which indicates the device remained far from equilibrium conditions at all times 3 2 diffusion coefficient diffusion coefficients at 25 c of the nine antipsychotic drugs determined using the diffusion cell method and the slice stacking method are shown table 1 d cell and d stack values were not significantly different p 0 05 for any of the compounds through comparison of triplicate measurements for the diffusion cell method the variables from eq s7 were linearly correlated r2 0 988 0 998 with experimental time supplementary fig s8 mean d cell values for the studied antipsychotic drugs ranged from 3 63 to 7 20 10 6 cm2 s 1 while d stack values ranged from 4 34 to 5 44 10 6 cm2 s 1 no statistically significant correlations between d and molecular mass of compounds were observed which might have resulted from the narrow molecular mass range of these compounds 236 27 326 80 da this result is consistent with those of previous studies urík et al 2020 for perfluoroalkyl compounds pharmaceuticals and personal care products with a range of molecular masses of 151 to 377 da and for polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with molecular masses in the range of 128 2 to 429 8 da rusina et al 2010 the d cell for carbamazepine 5 54 10 6 cm2 s 1 fluoxetine 4 72 10 6 cm2 s 1 and bupropion 4 48 10 6 cm2 s 1 determined during this study were similar to previously reported values in 1 5 agarose hydrogel with d values of 5 01 10 6 4 38 10 6 5 21 10 6 cm2 s 1 for carbamazepine fluoxetine and bupropion respectively challis et al 2016 fang et al 2019 the d stack for carbamazepine 4 55 10 6 cm2 s 1 was comparably less than the value 5 33 10 6 cm2 s 1 reported by urík et al 2020 three compounds e g venlafaxine duloxetine and amitriptyline log k ow 3 28 4 68 and 4 95 respectively failed to measure by the slice stacking method despite different experimental design of two methods d value derived from the diffusion cell method is simply depended on logarithmic linearization however the slice stacking method requires extraction and concentration procedures causing more uncertainty on the analytical processes the relative error values in our study for both methods were derived from the model regression fitting to the data the previous example for estimating the rising uncertainty of d value for copper in dgt sampler was negligible for these factors e g ph and ionic strength in comparison to the estimated diffusion area and analytical processes nevertheless since slight differences between the two methods the d values measured using the diffusion cell method was used for calculation dgt derived concentrations in this study 3 3 dgt fluxes of antipsychotic drugs in sediment when concentrations of antipsychotic drugs were averaged by day in water and sediment a declining trend of concentrations in the water column 8 2 cm and a similar decreasing trend in vertical scale of sediment porewater was observed except for lamotrigine and bupropion with the greatest concentrations at a depth of 2 to 4 cm fig 3 this result is consistent with previous observations that increasing dissolved concentrations of organic compounds were found in closer proximity to the sediment fernandez et al 2012 grimalt et al 2001 however for most compounds except for lamotrigine and bupropion concentrations in sediment porewater generally remained unchanged p 0 05 at depths below 2 cm concentrations between water and porewater remained within the same order of magnitude for lamotrigine bupropion and carbamazepine while concentrations of other compounds in sediment porewater were approximately 10 fold less than those in the water column the greatest concentration at 8 cm in water was for carbamazepine 15 73 2 14 µg l 1 which was greater than at 6 cm 9 58 1 30 µg l 1 and 2 cm 0 54 0 08 µg l 1 the greatest mean concentrations among water matrix samples were observed for carbamazepine 8 61 µg l 1 followed by duloxetine amitriptyline and citalopram 4 30 8 16 µg l 1 venlafaxine was observed at significantly lesser mean concentrations in both water 0 077 µg l 1 and sediment 0 009 µg l 1 because dgt devices are time weighted temporal variability of water concentrations diffusing laterally could not be measured therefore constant concentrations close to the water sediment interface were assumed for calculating diffusive fluxes nevertheless fluxes were normalized per day which showed net positive fluxes towards water from sediment fig 3 overall lesser fluxes 0 0012 0 089 ng cm 2 d 1 were observed for lamotrigine bupropion venlafaxine and duloxetine while citalopram 0 10 ng cm 2 d 1 and fluoxetine 0 14 ng cm 2 d 1 had similar fluxes the greatest flux was found for carbamazepine indicating that sediment borne carbamazepine has potential resupply ability to porewater and is prone to partition back to water at the water sediment interface 3 4 three adsorbing fractions of antipsychotic drugs 3 4 1 fast desorbing fraction the plot of st s0 versus extraction time for desorption of antipsychotic drugs in sediments sampled at day 1 and day 21 during the dgt deployment period is shown in fig 4 where the solid line derived from exponential curve fitting by eq s1 in section s4 the kinetic parameters obtained from eq s1 are shown in table s5 desorption of antipsychotic compounds decreased with increasing the deployment time mean desorptions of all compounds in sediment were approximately 21 2 3 for day 1 and 10 1 2 for day 21 the fr values decreased from 0 249 to 0 184 for amitriptyline 0 403 to 0 331 for bupropion 0 409 to 0 355 for carbamazepine 0 261 to 0 127 for citalopram 0 298 to 0 236 for clozapine 0 198 to 0 147 for duloxetine 0 320 to 0 275 for fluoxetine 0 411 to 0 329 for lamotrigine and 0 120 to 0 098 for venlafaxine which indicated that the labile fraction of these compounds decreased in sediments constants k rapid and k slow ranged from 10 1 to 10 2 h 1 and k sv ranged from 10 5 to 10 6 h 1 table s6 which is comparable to the magnitude of these parameters from previous labile fraction kinetic studies cheng et al 2019 trimble et al 2008 you et al 2007 the greatest k rapid values both at day 1 and day 21 were found for carbamazepine 0 517 and 0 367 h 1 and lamotrigine 0 531 to 0 383 h 1 while the least values 0 032 and 0 016 h 1 were found for venlafaxine this result suggests that carbamazepine and lamotrigine could be resupplied from other fractions in sediments while venlafaxine was prone to remain in sediment particles which might be associated with the ionic interactions of these compounds e g lamotrigine and carbamazepine navon et al 2011 zhang et al 2010 and the potential pool size of compound in sediment despite fr values of all compounds being stable within 24 h extraction period variations in nonlinear sorption might influence the magnitude ten hulscher et al 1999 the ratios of f24h to fr in sediments at day 1 and day 21 showed that the ratio ranged from 77 to 93 table s6 this suggests that a single extraction by methanol for 24 h is sufficient to represent the rapidly desorbing fraction of these drugs these findings are similar to previous results that equilibrium of fr could be reached in a short time 10 h during laboratory simulation with a positive linear regression between fr and f10h cheng et al 2019 3 4 2 stable desorbing fraction the trend of the concentration in sediments extracted following that of the rapidly desorbing fraction at each deployment time showed that a slight decreasing concentrations with deployment time were observed for most compounds whereas duloxetine showed a slightly declining concentration at day 21 supplementary fig s9 and table s7 the most significant extent of concentration increase was found for bupropion from 2 21 to 6 32 µg kg 1 and for fluoxetine from 0 73 to 1 43 µg kg 1 this result indicates the relative stable state for fraction transfer from stable desorbing fraction 3 4 3 bound residue fraction despite the hydrolysis method effectively releasing the bound residue fraction of organic compounds from sediments northcott and jones 2000 the uncertainty remains whether the hydrolysis processes or high temperature would influence the analytes and lead to inaccurate quantification for the accuracy and reliability of analysis results a single standard solution of each nine antipsychotic drugs was spiked in 10 ml of 1 m naoh solution at the target concentrations of 10 100 or 1000 µg l 1 at 80 c for 24 h to test whether the degradation occurred among nine antipsychotic drugs poor recoveries 30 were observed for bupropion and duloxetine while recoveries for other compounds were greater than 80 at all three concentrations this is consistent with previous observations that bupropion and duloxetine are not resistant to alkaline hydrolysis abbas et al 2012 rao et al 2010 therefore bupropion and duloxetine are not included in bound residue fraction discussion in comparison to concentration of stable desorbing fraction except for citalopram clozapine and fluoxetine having no significant changes p 0 05 the concentrations of other compounds showed apparent increases table s8 generally bound residue concentrations of antipsychotic drugs were increasing with sampling time 3 5 transfer of antipsychotic drugs in sediment during 21 sampling days the total measured portions of antipsychotic drugs not considering bupropion and duloxetine changed from 20 to 70 table s9 where total concentration was increased from 1 37 to 4 00 µg kg 1 for amitriptyline 0 46 to 1 28 µg kg 1 for carbamazepine 0 02 to 0 06 µg kg 1 for citalopram 1 60 to 1 99 µg kg 1 for fluoxetine 1 61 to 6 11 µg kg 1 for lamotrigine and 2 13 to 5 51 µg kg 1 for venlafaxine whereas an approximately 50 decrease was observed in clozapine from 1 83 to 0 94 µg kg 1 this suggests a continuous resupply of most selected compounds over time in the real environment while clozapine might experience a poor source pool and different mechanisms of degradation microbial degradation has been observed for several antipsychotic drugs carbamazepine oxazepam and codeine followed a lag period of about 1 day under laboratory simulation stein et al 2008 therefore we could not interpret whether degradation was due to biological processes or photodegradation in real matrices however our results demonstrated the certain levels of antipsychotic drugs persist in surface sediments the labile stable adsorbing and bound residue fractions of antipsychotic in sediments is presented in fig 5 calculated as the of the total concentrations of three fractions this can reflect the resupply ability of compounds to labile fraction the percentage of labile fraction of antipsychotic drugs all declined with the sampling time suggesting that the potential bioavailability of these drugs declined this decline only reflected the static state distribution of these compounds in sediments however while bound residue or stable desorbing fraction increased indicating a risk for fraction transfer to further influence the desorption rate of compounds from sediments to aqueous phase the relatively slow declines were observed within 6 days which might be inferred that some competition in sorption sites for different compounds and these compounds might be easier to diffuse to sediment porewater rather than sorption sites with increasing of sampling time the gradual decrease of labile fraction could be caused by organic sequestration clay sorption and diffusion to sediment micropores the stable adsorbing fraction of antipsychotic drugs showed decreases over time for amitriptyline 8 to 5 carbamazepine 29 to 15 lamotrigine 27 to 14 and venlafaxine 46 to 19 increases for citalopram 43 to 50 clozapine 17 to 50 and fluoxetine 48 to 72 this difference for different compounds might due to the intensity of binding forces or sequestration through the transfer from stable desorbing fraction to bound reside fraction the bound residue fraction of antipsychotic drugs from 1 to 21 d ranged from 61 to 81 for amitriptyline 39 to 71 for carbamazepine 33 to 37 for citalopram 42 to 65 for lamotrigine 41 to 75 for venlafaxine 62 to 39 for clozapine and 26 to 16 for fluoxetine despite the bound residue fraction is generally accompanied by the other two fractions increasing bound residue fraction here for majority of compounds was not directly to the increase of labile fraction especially for 1 to 6 d this observation is based on the solid sediment capacity of solutes cornelissen et al 1997 weber and huang 1996 which is the fraction for some compounds clozapine and fluoxetine could not firmly adsorb onto sediment particle surface and the occurrence of channels and nanopores for sandy texture led to slow diffusion into internal sediment matrix where organic compounds could be eventually retained generally results reported here indicate that bound residue fraction of antipsychotic drugs can be an important resupply source for transfer to labile fraction that is continuously increased with sampling days when a previously developed mathematical model cheng et al 2019 was used to simulate the processes of three fractions transfer over sampling time without considering degradation conditions supplementary fig s10 eq 9 11 9 d c l a b i l e d t

coefficients of partitioning between labile and stable adsorbing fractions for antipsychotic drugs kfb and kbf represent the rate coefficients partitioning between labile and bound residue fractions for antipsychotic drugs ksb and kbs represent the rate coefficients partitioning between stable desorbing and bound residue fractions for antipsychotic drugs the detailed computation processes of the model are shown in section s9 the good correlation for model fitting r 2 0 915 0 993 for three different fractions was observed fig 6 the constant coefficients k were not constant during the sampling day and significantly different table 2 overall kfs is bigger than ksf from the first to last sampling day for all compounds implying these antipsychotic drugs were prone to retain in the sediment particle rather than sediment porewater at 21 d the increasing kfs values suggested that more antipsychotic drugs escaped from labile phase to stable desorbing fraction kfb and kbf standing for the ability of sequestrating of compounds in sediment particles and its antidromic release respectively were nearly 0 at day 1 indicating little labile fraction transferred to bound residue fraction this result suggested that antipsychotic drugs had a lag time to be sorbed onto sediments at 21 d kfb increased for all drugs except for citalopram clozapine and fluoxetine showing these three drugs had been completely adsorbed by the adsorption sites of sediment particles and pool size for them might be limited as well the small values of kfb indicated that antipsychotic drugs were partitioned to organic matter and blocked to have a fraction transfer which is taken as the final fate for organic contaminant non bioavailability although kfb and kbf were much lower than the other k values the transfer between bound reside and stable desorbing fractions occurred before diffusion into sediment porewater the increased ksb and kbs for amitriptyline carbamazepine lamotrigine and venlafaxine could represent not irreversible processes whereas slightly decreased ksb was corresponding to the decreased values of kfb this could also reflect the dynamic processes in bound residue fraction where less antipsychotic drugs could be potentially released to some extent with accessibility to biota cheng et al 2019 xing et al 1996 3 6 resupply kinetics and labile size of antipsychotic drugs in sediment the r value represents the resupply of antipsychotic drugs from the sediment particles to porewater which responds to the depletion by dgt devices the r values in sediment depth of 2 15 cm ranged from 0 15 to 0 41 for carbamazepine 0 14 to 0 39 for lamotrigine 0 12 to 0 35 for bupropion 0 13 to 0 34 for fluoxetine 0 11 to 0 30 for citalopram 0 11 to 0 29 for clozapine 0 09 to 0 25 for amitriptyline 0 08 to 0 22 for duloxetine and 0 05 to 0 15 for venlafaxine when there was no supply from sediment but only diffusion to supply rdiff values derived from difs model varied 0 02 to 0 04 for all drugs therefore the sediment for all antipsychotic drugs has ability to supply the positive fluxes from solid phase to sediment solution in general r values decreased gradually with deployment time and also with depth supplementary fig s11 and the differences of that between 8 and 15 cm were not significant p 0 05 for all drugs indicating the resupply ability decreased with the depth and resupply could not be quickly provided during the time interval of dgt deployment in real conditions additionally the largest r values were found for carbamazepine and lamotrigine while venlafaxine showed the lowest value which is similar to the values of ksf and kbf indicting the low supply to sediment porewater for venlafaxine while carbamazepine and lamotrigine could be resupplied quicker the labile antipsychotic drugs in the solid phase could release during dgt deployment to supply those depleted by dgt from sediment solution the estimated pool size for antipsychotic drugs varied from 0 07 to 0 50 µg kg 1 table 3 using eq 12 the distribution coefficient k d calculated as the ratio of concentration of labile antipsychotic drugs the equilibrium reached concentration using consecutive extraction for fast desorbing fraction at 10 h to cp can be used to indicate the labile pool size in sediments our k d values 0 02 32 32 cm3 g 1 table 3 are within the ranges published 0 01 64 cm3 g 1 ben hur et al 2003 li et al 2021 ling et al 2005 payá pérez et al 1992 the order of average k d values is followed carbamazepine lamotrigine fluoxetine bupropion clozapine citalopram amitriptyline duloxetine venlafaxine interestngly our data showed k d declined with depth for all drugs except values for fluoxetine were close to 0 and the difference between k d and kdl was one order of magnitude while no significant decrease with depth was found in kdl this difference could be due to the solvent extraction to get the maximum compounds from the labile fraction and the loss for porewater taken over time e g evaporation and redistribution out of field condition however it is important that k d and r values can get the same results for resupply abilities by calculating labile pool size indicting k d can be a parameter to use for predicting magnitude of resupply for organic compounds considering the alkaline drugs the slightly decreasing ph and lower organic matter in our sediment had little influence on the adsorption additionally the response time tc and the desorption adsorption rate constant k 1 k 1 at different depths table 3 showed that the greatest values were found at 2 cm demonstrating the top layer has the fastest resupply ten fold greater k 1 values than k 1 values for all drugs were found indicating the desorption processes were dominant within 2 15 cm depth as the investigated sediment was in a neutral ph environment the measured antipsychotic drugs remained in their neutral form with adsorption mainly through van der waals forces or hydrogen bonding which might be related to the dissolved organic matter for controlling the fraction transfer resupply kinetic characteristics and labile pool size 4 conclusion this study used in situ deployed dgt devices in water and sediment in field during 21 days our results showed positive fluxes of nine antipsychotic drugs from sediment to water processes were controlled by the resupply capability from solid phase to sediment porewater although raplidly desorbing labile fractions declined during 21 days the constant coefficients of antipsychotic drugs could be supplied to labile phase quickly from the stable desorbing and bound residue fractions with a lag time the quickest transfer rate to labile fraction was found for amitriptyline and carbamazepine and the slowest for venlafaxine which has been also verified by r ratio response time and desorption rate constant obtained from difs model the estimated labile pool size from difs might not be the best way to reflect the real status while the labile pool size calculated at equilibrium from a first order three compartment kinetic model could fit the changes of r values well we propose that this could be an auxiliary parameter to understand

16073,membrane fouling is one of major obstacles in the application of membrane technologies accurately predicting or simulating membrane fouling behaviours is of great significance to elucidate the

while membrane fouling is still a critical obstacle that limits its widespread applications shim et al 2021 membrane fouling occurs mainly due to the attachment accumulation and adsorption of substances onto membrane surfaces and or into their pores during the filtration process meng et al 2017 niu et al 2020 the occurrence of membrane fouling typically leads to a significant compromise of membrane filtration performance and thus the prevention or mitigation of membrane fouling is a critical measure in order to achieve a sustainable membrane operation a prediction of membrane fouling is of great significance for the selection of pretreatment measures or the development of antifouling techniques schmitt and do 2017 shim et al 2021 which has attracted increasing interests in the past decades bagheri et al 2019 mechanistic models based on membrane flux transmembrane pressure tmp pollutant salt rejection and other operating parameters have been developed to understand and predict membrane fouling behaviours in membrane based processes for water and wastewater treatment griffiths et al 2014 pimentel et al 2015 zuthi et al 2017 however due to the complexity of membrane fouling processes it is rather challenging to accurately predict the occurrence or evolution of membrane fouling using these classical mathematical models nandi et al 2010 wu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020a therefore it is very necessary to develop more effective approaches that can overcome the shortcomings of traditional models and accurately predict the performance of membrane processes the rapid development of artificial intelligence ai which has been widely used in many fields such as healthcare smart cities intelligent search big data and pattern recognition offers a great opportunity to achieve this goal alam et al 2022 with the innovation and development of technologies along with industry 4 0 more attention has been paid to system efficiency long term performance prediction and the integration of ai strategies into system operation viet et al 2021a the application of ai in the membrane processes has attracted much interests from scientists and engineers involved in the membrane field during the past 20 years for instance ai approaches have been used for the prediction of membrane filtration performance of drug molecules brocke et al 2019 design and optimization of thin film

different membrane filtration systems this work provides a critical review of different ai based technologies applied for membrane fouling prediction the adaptive capability and prediction accuracy of ai tools for reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf membrane bioreactor mbr and membrane distillation md systems were critically evaluated the research progress on modeling and optimization of membrane fouling prediction using multilayer perceptual mlp networks radial basis function rbf networks search algorithms fl gp and svm etc was also summarized furthermore the input and output variables that affect the prediction accuracy and performance were further analyzed based on literature database during the past 20 years finally research gaps and future perspectives are discussed for ai based techniques aiming for a more precise prediction of membrane fouling 2 basic information of ai techniques for prediction of membrane fouling 2 1 commonly employed ai techniques in membrane filtration the artificial neuron model was proposed in 1943 kicking off a new era in ann research in 1950 alan turing proposed a method to identify a machine as intelligent in his paper computing machinery and intelligence the term artificial intelligence was formally proposed in 1956 at a conference held at dartmouth university zhang and lu 2021 in the 1950s and 1960s the creation of ai prototypes sparked the first wave of ai booming back propagation bp neural networks appeared in the 1980s which further stimulated the research of artificial neural network algorithm the most recent and ongoing ai boom started in 2006 when deep learning dl methods were proposed and since then ai has continued to advance in image recognition and big data processing kubassova et al 2021 ai techniques attempts to mine massive historical data for implied patterns and use them for prediction or classification which is also considered to be more like a function where the input is the sample data and the output is the desired result over the past 20 years ai techniques have been used to predict membrane fouling and evaluate membrane filtration performance the term ai is a broad concept which generally includes big data machine learning representation learning expert systems as well as computer vision it is dependent on certain methods and steps which are called as algorithms to perform each operation in ai techniques zhang and lu 2021 fig 1 shows the commonly used algorithms for ai techniques in prediction of membrane fouling generally algorithms for ai techniques mainly include artificial neural networks ann fuzzy logic fl support vector machines svm genetic programming gp and search algorithms zhong et al 2021 search algorithms including genetic algorithms ga and particle swarm optimization pso are important optimization approaches search algorithms can be used to optimize the performance of modeling techniques to jointly guide the optimization of operating conditions in membrane separation processes besides these search algorithms can be coupled with other modeling algorithms such as ann fl and svm generally these hybrid algorithms can achieve better performance due to the advantage of various search algorithms 2 2 advantages of ai techniques over mathematical models in prediction of membrane fouling intensive research efforts have been devoted to the development of ai or mathematical models in order to better describe membrane fouling behaviours and some of them has shown the satisfactory results in predicting the change of tmp hazrati et al 2017 evolution of permeate flux boyle gotla et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 fouling resistance peleato et al 2017 and formation of cake layer griffiths et al 2014 pimentel et al 2015 zuthi et al 2017 conventional mathematical modeling usually utilizes mathematical or empirical methods besides the equations of some mathematical models were usually complex and time consuming to be solved compared to ai models conventional mathematical models were not always successful in predicting membrane fouling behaviours due to the complexities of membrane fouling park et al 2019 moreover using conventional mathematical models to predict membrane fouling are commonly flawed because these models usually simplify the membrane fouling process given that the time varying nature of the interactions between foulants and membranes is poorly understood guglielmi et al 2007 ai has several advantages over the conventional mechanistic models such as the learning ability and the capability to deal with imprecise and highly complex non linear data unlike mathematical models ai has been regarded as a black box bagheri et al 2019 and predicts membrane fouling through learning mechanism based on dataset rather than using mathematical equations in recent years ai techniques have been gradually applied to pilot scale and even full scale membrane filtration systems and achieved high accuracy in the prediction of permeate flux permeate flow rate and membrane rejection roehl et al 2018 schmitt et al 2018 srivastava et al 2021 when the number of input parameters is small mathematical models can be effective in predicting or simulating membrane fouling if a large number of input parameters are used the development of the mechanistic models will be very complex and difficult most of mechanistic models were developed and tested at laboratory or pilot scale which lacks self learning capabilities and might not be able to monitor or control membrane fouling in real time in full scale plants therefore it is favorable to use intelligent methods such as powerful computational intelligence paradigms to resolve such complex non linear relationships 2 3 evolution of ai techniques for fouling prediction based on literature survey the number of publications in prediction of membrane fouling field has rapidly increased in the past two decades fig s1 and visual analysis of the co occurrence of keywords can well reflect the research progress of membrane fouling prediction fig 2 as shown in fig 2a the keywords are classified into three large clusters during the bibliometric mapping the red cluster is mainly comprised of keywords related to membrane fouling such as membrane surface cake layer interaction and fouling mechanism the green cluster mainly consisted of the keywords associated with the basic information of ai based models such as ann layer neuron processing time training procedure genetic algorithm etc and the indicators of output such as flux decline transmembrane pressure fouling resistance etc the keywords related to the analysis process such as experimental design optimization and performance index are clustered under the blue section furthermore as shown in fig 2b the overlay visualization network map indicates that the research of membrane fouling prediction before 2010 mainly focused on pilot plant flux decline and crossflow velocity during the last decade i e 2011 2021 the keywords membrane bioreactor technology fouling mechanism artificial intelligence and wastewater treatment plant increased in popularity this might suggest that ai based methods have been gradually applied to investigation of membrane fouling mechanisms in wastewater treatment plants in recent years 3 the application of ai algorithms in prediction of membrane fouling 3 1 artificial neural network due to the ability of robust autonomous learning many researchers have used ann to deal with environmental problems by solving multivariate non linear problems aleboyeh et al 2008 viet et al 2021b currently ann is the mainstream ai algorithm because of its ease of implementation and relatively high accuracy ann has a powerful information storage and computational capability by using black box learning methods to some extent it resembles human learning behaviour that can solve multivariate non linear problems zhang and pan 2014 meanwhile ann does not require a mathematical description of the phenomena involved in the process and therefore it takes less time to solve the targeted problem compared to traditional mathematical modeling as shown in fig 3 a b ann is derived from biological neural systems and consists of a large number of interconnected artificial neurons lópez et al 2017 each ann consists of artificial neurons that have been reorganized into layers and linked together a single layer of artificial neurons in an ann is insufficient to detect the intricate interactions between inputs and outputs in the network in most cases three layers of connected neurons consisting of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer are utilized to predict the outputs mlp network fig 3c and rbf network fig 3d alam et al 2022 are two widely used ann networks with more details described in supporting information si generally deep learning technologies apply advanced ann algorisms such as recurrent neural networks rnn and convolutional neural networks cnn for feature identification big data analysis or pattern recognition fan et al 2018 kamrava et al 2021 schmidhuber 2015 in the rnn model the output parameters from the previous step are transferred as input to a current step as shown in fig 4 a the rnn model consists of input parameters activation function and output values each activation function f is a long short term memory gate which trains the model by using back propagation with a forget gate input gate and output gate besides cnn is another representative algorithm of dl technology which includes convolutional computation and has a deep structure fig 4b shows the architecture of the cnn model which is one of the most powerful models for solving problems related to image classification object recognition and natural language cnn utilizes layers with convolving filters for local feature extraction then the classification layer makes decision based on the parameters collected from the previous layers alam et al 2022 besides cnn layers are connected to a small region in the previous layer which can reduce wasteful neurons and prevent overfitting park et al 2019 ann and its derivatives have been used in many studies to forecast the separation performance and fouling behaviour of the membrane kamali et al 2021 most of the studies that developed ann to predict membrane fouling achieved high accuracy during the past two decades to get an overall understanding fig 5 summarizes the prediction accuracy of ann modeling for representative membrane fouling parameters such as permeate flux membrane rejection permeate flow rate tmp and fouling resistance in different membrane filtration systems the indexes that are frequently used to measure the differences between predicted data and the experimental data are listed in table s1 since coefficient of determination r2 is the most widely used performance indicator in these studies it was selected to evaluate the discrepancy between the predicted data and the actual data in ro systems the representative parameters of membrane fouling are permeate flux membrane rejection permeate flow rate and permeate total dissolved solids tds compared with other outputs ann has the best performance in predicting permeate flux in ro with r2 0 97 in nf and uf systems the representative parameters of membrane fouling are permeate flux and membrane rejection the prediction accuracy of permeate flux was better than membrane rejection apart from permeate flux and membrane rejection tmp is also a representative parameter in the membrane fouling prediction during mf process due to the numerous influencing factors and complex non linear relationships related to the fouling process the prediction accuracy varies and needs to be further improved in mbr with r2 of permeate flux ranged from 0 85 to 0 99 moreover fouling resistance was often used as an output to evaluate the overall performance of mbr system currently representative outputs on membrane fouling of md are dominated by permeate flux and permeate flow rate and the majority of ann based models have achieved good prediction accuracy for permeate flux with r2 0 97 the following parts describe the research progress of ann in predicting membrane fouling of different membrane filtration systems in detail 3 1 1 reverse osmosis and forward osmosis table 1 summarizes publications of ann modeling focusing on fouling control of ro fo and nf systems mlp ann is currently the dominant algorithm applied in ro forward osmosis fo and nf systems over the past 20 years in 1995 niemi et al 1995 established an mlp ann model for simulating the membrane flux of the ro system and the relative error re between the predicted value and actual value was 7 5 the water permeability constant k w is an important parameter that affects the operation of the ro process an mlp ann trained with back propagation method have successfully predicted the dynamic k w values for a ro desalination plant barello et al 2014 it was also found that the effect of feed salinity on k w value was more significant under low pressure in general a number of studies have shown that the ann is a competitive efficient and powerful tool in predicting the membrane fouling behaviour the first study that compared response surface methodology rsm and ann in ro desalination process was conducted by khayet et al 2011 the ann model was found to be a global model showing higher accuracy r2 0 9998 in prediction of the ro desalination performance than the rsm in a wide range of salt concentrations likewise a comparative modeling study was carried out by k et al 2021 to compare the prediction accuracy of ann and rsm models during fo process the results showed that ann performed better than rsm one model can show different prediction accuracy on different target variables for example garg and joshi garg and joshi 2014 developed an ann model for performance evaluation of a small scale brackish water ro process in this study the ann model successfully predicted water recovery r2 0 9611 tds rejection r2 0 9246 and specific energy consumption r2 0 9044 respectively furthermore to find the most suitable ann structure for the prediction of membrane fouling aish et al 2015 trained and developed mlp and rbf neural networks to predict total tds concentrations and permeate flow rate of a ro desalination plant compared with the conventional statistical model r 0 8976 ann models showed a better simulation of permeate flow rate further research revealed that the accuracy of mlp predictive neural network r 0 9904 was slightly better than that of the rbf model r 0 9853 likewise for a fo process jawad et al 2020 applied mlp model to predict permeate flux and acheived an accuracy of 97 3 r2 it also demonstrated that a larger number of neurons and a smaller number of hidden layers were beneficial to improving the accuracy of ann in full scale plants ann modeling can guide data collection to better predict and control membrane fouling by identifying the most important parameters for example ann models were trained with six years of data to identify the causes of membrane fouling in a full scale ro system and the models provided feasible strategies to control membrane fouling roehl et al 2018 total chlorine electrical conductance and tds were essential parameters for early fouling while turbidity nitrate organic nitrogen and nitrite were important predictors for later fouling as an advanced version of the ann dl techniques based on fouling image recognition have also been developed for the prediction of membrane fouling park et al 2019 first applied cnn to model fouling growth and flux decline based on real time optical coherence tomography oct images the results showed that cnn could improve the prediction accuracy on fouling layer growth of nf ro membranes with r2 0 99 likewise a cnn model had been developed for the prediction of thickness porosity roughness and density of the fouling layer of fo membrane by using real time oct images im et al 2021 the prediction results showed high r2 values in predicting membrane fouling characteristics thickness 0 90 porosity 0 86 roughness 0 92 and density 0 90 3 1 2 nanofiltration to predict long term membrane fouling resistance shetty and chellam 2003 applied an ann model in a nf process the ann trained with 10 of the total data and 93 of the outputs achieved high accuracy within 5 absolute relative error in a cross flow nf process filtrating waste brine an ann with tmp time and temperature as the inputs was used to predict flux and total hydraulic resistance salehi and razavi 2012 and the results showed that the ann with 1 hidden layer consisting of 9 neurons had the best fitting results which obtained the r2 of 0 96 and 0 98 for flux and hydraulic resistance respectively khaouane et al 2017 investigated the fouling phenomenon caused by the interaction between traces of organic compounds and membrane surfaces in this study a bootstrap based ann was developed to predict the rejections of charged and uncharged organic compounds the trained ann obtained satisfactory results between the predicted and experimental rejections with r 0 9862 yangali quintanilla et al 2009 applied ann models to predict the rejection of neutral organic compounds by nf and ro process they also identified that the most important input variable was salt rejection it should be noted that two neurons were sufficient in the hidden layer and four neurons did not improve performance an ann model with one hidden layer of four neurons had successfully tracked the non linear behavior of the rejection of salts nacl and mgcl2 in a cross flow nf process darwish et al 2007 the superiority of ann over other models in simulating nf process has been demonstrated for example it was reported that the ann predicted nf performance at low values of salt rejection and water flux was more accurately than the spiegler kedem model did al zoubi et al 2007 srivastava et al 2021 explored the potential of ann and rsm for modeling a pilot scale nf ro hybrid system ann with four input neurons ten hidden neurons and three output neurons showed more satisfactory performance in optimizing the nf ro system than rsm based on 38 430 datapoints hu et al 2021 employed three different ai models ann svm and random forest to forecast the separation performance of an organic solvent nf process ann obtained high accuracy in predicting the permeance r2 0 90 and rejection r2 0 91 long short term memory lstm is a special type of rnn which is mainly designed to solve the gradient disappearance problems during the training of long sequences shim et al 2021 developed a new fouling model based on lstm to analyze nf filtration performance and fouling development based on time series datasets this lstm model achieved relatively high prediction accuracy for permeate flux and fouling layer thickness with r2 0 97 3 1 3 ultrafiltration accurately modelling the uf separation process is very important for solving fouling issues and optimizing operating conditions detailed information of the application of ann in the uf processes are presented in table 2 an ann was developed to model the time evolution of tmp of uf plants for drinking water production delgrange et al 1998b in this study turbidity permeate flow rate tmp at the filtration start point and tmp before last backwash have been shown sufficient to predict the evolution of mean tmp in addition mlp ann has been successfully used in capturing the non linear dynamics of the cross flow uf razavi et al 2004 and controlling permeate flux decline in the uf process curcio et al 2006 liu and kim 2008 compared the performance of mathematic and mechanical model blocking laws with ann model for uf process compare with the blocking laws ann model achieved excellent agreement between prediction and experimental tmp values in comparison with the classical pore blocking models which need to be fitted for each experimental test ann is capable of simulating all the experimental data instantly to further verify the applicability of these two tools in the prediction of membrane fouling meighani et al 2013 compared ann and classical pore blocking models in simulating flux decline and the results showed that ann had a higher accuracy r2 0 9999 likewise a comparison between ann and hermia s models were also carried out to model flux decline during crossflow ultrafiltration corbatón báguena et al 2016 results showed that the accuracy of ann was comparable to that of hermia s models and the optimum number of neurons in the intermediate layer was 8 in addition to predicting the permeate flux and tmp of the uf process peleato et al 2017 incoporated continuous fluorescence characterization data into neural networks to predict short term fouling fluctuations during uf process it demonstrated that the trained neural networks were a potentially powerful modeling approach in predicting the development of fouling resistance to provide an early warning of the membrane fouling chew et al 2017 combined darcy s law and ann to predict the specific cake resistance and total suspended solids in a uf pilot plant by inputting the data of feed water turbidity filtration time and tmp this hybrid model could be easily implemented in the industrial scale uf treatment plant as it did not need any additional costly analysis equipment 3 1 4 microfiltration ann model has also been extensively employed for the prediction and control of the fouling occurring in the mf process as shown in table 2 mainly three types of ann including mlp rbf and rnn have been ultilized in prediction of membrane fouling in mf processes the most widely used inputs include tmp cross flow velocity and temperature while the popular outputs involve permeate flux tmp evolution and hydraulic resistance in 1995 dornier et al 1995 first introduced mlp ann to dynamically model the total hydraulic resistance of the membrane in a crossflow mf system a well trained ann shows a great potential to predict highly non linear membrane fouling behaviors such as tmp variations and flux decline chellam 2005 used ann to accurately capture transient permeate flux decline caused by polydisperse colloids and quantify the impact of particles on fouling caused by non linear fluid dynamics the results also revealed that the initial permeation flux was the most critical influence factor on membrane fouling while the shear rate showed weaker effects chellam 2005 liu et al 2009 also found that feed water turbidity permeate flux and backwash frequency duration were equally important to predict tmp variations when used as the input variables aydiner et al 2005 compared the performance of ann and kol tuniewicz model in simulating of flux decline during crossflow mf ann could achieve higher accuracy in predicting the permeate flux from process variables such as tmp feed solution concentration and membrane type in another research it has been reported that the prediction accuracy of permeation flux using ann was better than that of the cake filtration model nandi et al 2010 likewise it was reported that ann model could achieve excellent agreement r2 0 996 in predicting the permeate flux decline in the mf system which performed better than the classical fouling models i e complete blocking r2 0 186 intermediate blocking r2 0 988 standard blocking r2 0 866 and cake filtration r2 0 858 ghandehari et al 2011 cheng et al 2008 proposed a modified rbf ann to predict effect of interparticle interactions on flux decline in mf the results showed that the prediction accuracies of the ann could be further improved if more data was available at different ranges of hydrodynamic and physicochemical operating conditions in a comparative research rbf ann was more accurate than the conventional bp ann and multiple regression method in producing a good predictability of the long term flux decline chen and kim 2006 ghandehari et al 2013 also demonstrated the superiority of rbf networks over the conventional bp networks in predicting flux decline in the cross flow mf system filtrating bovine serum albumin bsa 3 1 5 membrane bioreactor membrane fouling is still a key obstacle that have restricted the wider application of mbr process applying ai in mbr systems for the optimization of system efficiency and prediction of membrane fouling behaviour has attracted increasing attention in the past two decades with relevant studies summarized in table 3 the selection of potential input dataset is essential for ann model development for example pioneer work was done by geissler et al 2005 who achieved satisfying and promising results of predicting the permeate flux and its decay in a pilot mbr by establishing an elman network enn in this study tmp rate of tmp change filtration cycle length backwash cycle length sludge retention time srt total suspended solids temperature and oxygen decay rate were selected as input variables however mixed liquor parameters that related to membrane fouling such as chemical oxygen demand cod or mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were not considered in this study hazrati et al 2017 reported that hydraulic retention time hrt and mlss highly affected the tmp prediction during ann modeling in another study an mlp ann has been successfully developed to predict tmp variations in a pilot scale anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor schmitt et al 2018 however they also reported that important wastewater parameters such as mlss cod ph and dissolved oxygen do could not be associated well with tmp besides the ann with total nitrogen tn total phosphorus and nitrate as input variables achieved high accuracy r2 0 850 and rmse 0 099 cmhg in predicting tmp variations viet and jang 2021 identified the most effective input variables for predicting permeate flux and membrane fouling which include ph conductivity nh4 n and tn concentrations besides the operating parameters are also important influencing factors of membrane fouling in the long term operation of mbrs it was observed that an mlp ann model with backwash time and service time as input variables predicted permeate flux accurately aidan et al 2008 model structure is also an important parameter which affects accurate prediction for instance ann models were further introduced to predict flux and membrane fouling resistance of an osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr which also proved efficient with r2 values 0 90 viet and jang 2021 this study suggested that the optimal model structure for permeate flux was an ann model containing 2 hidden layers and 30 neurons while an ann model containing 2 hidden layers and 5 neurons was optimal for membrane fouling resistance in addition to predicting variations of tmp permeate flux and membrane fouling resistance ann has been used to better understand the fouling mechanisms fouling is associated with not only the hydrodynamic forces due to aeration and or filtration but also the short range interfacial interactions between the foulant and the membrane surface chen et al 2016 mirbagheri et al 2015 wang et al 2013 the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory is widely used for the purpose of quantifying such interactions chen et al 2017 the advanced xdlvo method which combines triangulation techniques and surface elemental integration sei methods with the extended xdlvo theory has been developed in pursuit of this goal teng et al 2018 due to the complex non linear relationship between membrane surface morphology and interfacial interactions the computations with the advanced xdlvo method are time consuming teng et al 2019 alternatively ann is a promising tool for the understanding of the hydrodynamics and short range interfacial interactions during the fouling process kamali et al 2021 if the trained ann can give a satisfactory description of the complex relationships and interfacial interactions among various factors in the fouling process the computational burden will be greatly reduced rbf ann had been firstly employed for the proof of concept and showed quick and efficient responses to quantify the interfacial energy zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 introduced a rbf ann to predict the interfacial interactions between sludge flocs and membranes the quantification of the interfacial interactions by the trained rbf ann saved up to 98 of computation time compared to the advanced xdlvo method to reduce salt accumulation and membrane fouling viet et al 2021a proposed a rnn model to predict the water flux and permeate conductivity of an osmotic membrane bioreactor in this study the rmse values between the actual and predicted values were 0 16699 l m2 h for water flux this result suggested that the rnn model could be applied not only in the independent process of fo but also in the integrated processes such as ombr viet et al 2021a 3 1 6 membrane distillation md is a novel separation process using vapor pressure difference between the warmer feedwater and cooler permeate as a driving force similar to other membrane processes fouling is still a bottleneck that limits the application of md which can lead to a declined water flux and an accelerated pore wetting warsinger et al 2015 therefore it is also quite necessary to find an effective method to predict the md performance and membrane fouling behaviour conventional mathematical models e g computational fluid dynamics ballistic transport model and structural network model used in md are highly dependent on the transport mechanisms and phenomena in the system which might result in a relatively low prediction accuracy hitsov et al 2015 predicting membrane fouling and analyzing its effects on permeate flux is crucial for md process khayet and cojocaru 2012 studied a feed forward ann modeling of permeate flux in air gap md system it was concluded that ann model was able to predict the permeate flux at a high accuracy r2 0 992 based on process variables such as the air gap thickness cooling inlet temperature feed inlet temperature and feed flow rate likewise an mlp ann 3 9 1 has been developed by means of bp training method to predict the md performance i e product of the distillate flux and the salt rejection khayet and cojocaru 2013 the well trained ann model revealed that the performance was associated with the inlet feed temperature and the sweeping air flow rate choi et al 2017 reported the capability of the ann model to accurately predict the colloidal silica fouling rate in direct contact md system r2 0 99 while r2 values obtained by the cake formation model were only between 0 93 and 0 99 in addition kim et al 2020 applied ann and rsm to predict the occurrence of pore wetting in direct contact md because of the nonlinear characteristics of the wetting phenomenon ann showed higher accuracy more recently mittal et al 2021 employed an ann model coupled with ga to analyze the effects of operating parameters such as feed pressure feed temperature flow rate and operation time on membrane fouling in md this hybrid protocol successfully modeled the md process with r2 value of above 0 98 and concluded optimum operating conditions at different solute concentrations table 4 summarizes the detailed information of ann modeling for membrane fouling prediction in the md processes obviously mlp neural network was the dominant ai tool in membrane fouling prediction for md process generally most ann models selected evaporator temperature vacuum pressure feed flow rate and solute concentration as the most frequently input parameters currently representative outputs on membrane fouling of md are dominated by permeate flux and permeate flow rate and the majority of ann based models have achieved good prediction accuracy for permeate flux with r2 0 97 the effect of driving force for mass transfer on the membrane fouling process and fouling mechanisms have not been well reported compared to other type of membrane filtration processes the application of ai tool in md in the past years is relatively limited although rms and ga methods have been gradually introduced into the membrane fouling prediction in the past two years these studies are still insufficient therefore different ai algorithms including search algorithms fl gp and as well as their hybrid forms need to be further studied to determine the most suitable algorithms for md system 3 2 fuzzy logic fuzzy logic fl a method based on multi valued logic has many advantages over classical methods especially when vague data or prior knowledge is involved fuzzy systems use the concepts of fl theory to convert natural language into mathematical models madaeni and kurdian 2011 in comparison to ann fl has the advantage of being able to handle noisy and distorted multivariate data altunkaynak and chellam 2010 fig 4c demonstrates the architecture of fl in modeling of membrane fouling technically the fl system includes four components fuzzification fuzzy rule base fuzzy output engine and defuzzification akkurt et al 2004 the details of each working step in fl are further described in si fl has been applied in the membrane filtration process to investigate the membrane fouling behaviours altunkaynak and chellam 2010 programmed fl to predict time variant specific fluxes profiles with initial permeate flux entrance shear rate instantaneous pressure and filtration time as inputs the robust fl model provided a platform for quantitatively capturing the cumulative effects of colloidal particle sizes on membrane fouling during the crossflow mf process the high predictive performance coefficient of efficiency 0 96 of fl could further optimize the backwash efficiency and chemical cleaning operations of mf systems altunkaynak and chellam 2010 besides fuzzy set logic has been introduced into an advanced control system enabling to supervise and optimize mbr filtration process brauns et al 2011 the advanced control system using fl could continuously modify the system settings and achieved intelligent control according to the filtration performance madaeni and kurdian 2011 integrated the ga method into the design of the fuzzy model benefiting from the ga this hybrid model accurately predicted flux and rejection of mf membrane well consistent with experimental data r2 0 9748 for flux r2 0 9309 for rejection fl was further coupled with ann to optimize filtration operations because of its good interpretability anfis is a hybrid of two powerful ann and fis algorithms which combines the computational power of ann and reasoning capabilities of fl rego et al 2018 anfis is recommended as a powerful tool for generating more accurate outcomes than ann and has successfully been utilized for enhancing membrane filtration efficiency in comparison with the ann model the anfis model could provide more reliable predictions for the separation of lead ions by uf rahmanian et al 2012 sargolzaei et al 2012 applied bp ann rbf and anfis to predict the cod removal efficiency and permeate flux of mf process in this work the well trained anfis performed better than the other two models error 1 rahimzadeh et al 2016 applied anfis to investigate the mf process treating oily wastewater with the inputs of tmp oil concentration and filtration time this model successfully simulated permeate volume with r2 0 999 to investigate the performance of a hydrophilic polyethersulfone membrane hedayati moghaddam et al 2017 employed fuzzy inference system fis to predict permeate flux where defuzzification operator was the center of rotation centroid with the best agreement achieved r2 0 975 anfis and mlp ann models were constructed to simulate and predict water flux of ombr in this study electrical conductivity and mlss were key input parameters for the anfis model and the combination of ann and fl performed slightly better than ann alone in water flux prediction with r2 of 0 9755 for anfis and 0 9861 for ann in predicting water flux hosseinzadeh et al 2020 in most cases anfis demonstrates better prediction strength in predicting water flux permeate volume and rejection than ann combining fl with ann would further improve the prediction accuracy of ann 3 3 genetic programming gp is a branch of evolutionary computation which is used to optimize a system based on user provided fitness criteria a detailed description of the gp and its workflow is presented in si gp has been applied to model the membrane fouling resistance in a pilot scale drinking water treatment plant lee et al 2009a and forecast the flux decline shokrkar et al 2012 gp accurately predicted the dynamic filtration process of a municipal wastewater treatment plant as a self organizing modeling tool hong and bhamidimarri 2003 lee et al 2009a applied gp to model the membrane fouling rate of pilot scale mf systems which was proven to be an effective tool for the analysis and prediction of membrane resistance under different water characteristics and operating conditions furthermore scaling is a challenging issue to the operation of ro systems cho et al 2010 developed a gp model to explore the effect of caso4 scale formation on the ro process the trained gp model confirmed that the concentration factor applied pressure and humic acid concentration were the main influencing factors on membrane fouling compared to stirring speed and filtration time in another study 12 month data collected from a pilot scale drinking water treatment system were used to train the gp model and the accuracy rate of the model reached 92 shokrkar et al 2012 moreover the gp model had a great potential in delivering a functional relationship for the permeation flux and the predicted value agreed well with the real data 95 accruacy shokrkar et al 2012 3 4 support vector machine svm belongs to the distinct category of ai which is a powerful learning method that can be used to deal with regression or classification problems in non linear models asfaram et al 2016 as presented in fig 4d the core of svm is to map the input variables to a higher dimensional feature space via the kernel function k xi xj and then perform linear regression in this space the detailed working mechanism of svm is shown in si svm model has been successfully employed to detect and assess the membrane fouling in real time gao et al 2007 in comparison with bp ann the structure optimized svm showed more excellent agreements between the predicted values and permeate flux with the small size of the training set gao et al 2016 aya et al 2016 investigated the effects of fe2 and mn2 on the membrane fouling by applying svm regression this robust svm approach was also employed to optimize the filtration monitoring procedure in a submerged membrane reactor adib et al 2019 developed an svm model to predict the grafting yield of benzophenone and hyperbranched polyethylene glycol peg on the membrane surface the results suggested that more hydrophilic polyethersulfone pes membranes would result in better performance in addition various ai hybrid techniques had been used to achieve the combined benefits alam et al 2022 for instance fazeli et al 2013 employed the least squares support vector machine lssvm to predict pseudo steady flux and pseudo steady fouling in this study the ga was implemented to tune the optimal model parameters and achieved satisfactory accuracy r2 0 999 the results showed that temperature and tmp were the most influencing factors on pseudo steady flux and pseudo steady fouling resistance 3 5 search algorithm to improve prediction accuracy modeling algorithms can be combined with other search algorithms search algorithms are intelligent optimization methods and can find the optimal solution of multiple solution problems search algorithms inspired by social behaviour or natural phenomena are highly paralleled adaptive robust and fault tolerant which can help to solve complex non linear problems different search algorithms have different sources of ideas which are used to solve practical problems by simulating different biological or physical behaviours in nature fig 6 lists the advantages and limitations of some typical search algorithms used in membrane fouling prediction the availability of open source libraries and improvements of algorithms are making ai technology more efficient as shown in fig 6a ga is a kind of search algorithm based on the principles of natural selection and biogenetics with the advantages of global search capability fast convergence and support for multi objective optimization however the search speed of the ga is relatively slow and more training time is required to obtain an accurate solution beg et al 2016 pso algorithm is a simple and robust optimization algorithm motivated by the principles of foraging behavior of bird flocks the sa is a global search algorithm derived from the annealing process in thermodynamics li et al 2017 fig 6b d shows decision flow charts of these search algorithms for example ga starts with a set of random solutions called population the selection crossover and mutation play an important role in generating new population for pso algorithm the individual in the population is called a particle cura 2012 the global optimal position is updated by changing the speed and position of each particle and the cycle continues until the optimal value is obtained sa starts with a randomly generated initial solution the sa determines whether to accept a new solution by metropolis acceptance criteria and finally gets the optimal solution which helps the sa algorithm avoid getting trapped in local optimal solutions more methodology algorithm principle and professional knowledge of ga pso algorithm and sa are described in si table 5 lists the applications of search algorithms for membrane fouling prediction and simulation which can be used to optimize ann fl and other ai tools in order to find the optimal operating conditions the integration of ga and neural network is currently a hot topic in predicting membrane fouling behaviours for example based on darwin s idea of the survival of the fittest strugholtz et al 2008 combined neural networks with ga which could reduce the operational cost by approximately 15 through optimizing the settings of filtration time flux and aluminum dosage chen and seidel 2002 reported that ga ann predicted the permeate flux decline more accurately than the ann models calibrated by the trial and error approach similarly soleimani et al 2013 developed a ga ann hybrid model to predict the permeation flux and fouling resistance during the crossflow uf process the study suggested that ga optimized ann can solve smooth or non smooth optimization problems and better predict the optimum operating parameters for achieving maximum flux and minimum membrane fouling soleimani et al 2013 the results also showed that one hidden layer of 8 neurons is an appropriate network structure in modeling uf based oily wastewater treatment process based on the water quality and operating parameters hwang et al 2009 employed ga method to predict permeate flux and membrane fouling simultaneously the prediction of membrane fouling using ga can be further used to optimize the preparation of antifouling membranes arefi oskoui et al 2017 madaeni et al 2010 the bp neural network successfully simulated the permeate flux of the mbr system li et al 2014 however limited by the slow training speed sensitivity of initial weights and the threshold of bp its accuracy and speed are still far from satisfactory to further improve the efficacy of bp ga method was incorporated to optimize the initial weights and threshold of bp neural network the results showed that ga based network was more suitable for the prediction of permeate flux in mbr with the average re reduced from 7 4 to 3 3 li et al 2014 the application of ga helped optimizing input parameters feed temperature tmp cross flow velocity feed ph and filtration time for the mlp ann and further improved the forecast accuracy of permeation flux badrnezhad and mirza 2014 for a submerged mbr system ga optimized the weights and thresholds of mlp ann and rbf ann models leading to an improved prediction accuracy of tmp and membrane permeability mirbagheri et al 2015 the pso algorithm is capable of finding the global optimal solution rapidly while the ga has global convergence wang and li 2018 combined ga and pso algorithms with the rnn model and such hybrid algorithm improved the convergence speed of ga and reduced the probability of pso falling into local optimum which effectively fulfilled the data prediction task and further improved the prediction accuracy li et al 2017 combined ga with sa algorithms to predict membrane fouling and the adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm asaga had a powerful global searching capacity of ga as well as a strong local searching ability of sa this study demonstrated that the asaga svm model had a higher prediction accuracy than sa svm when dealing with small sample data in addition to neural networks the pso algorithm can be further applied to optimize other ai tools for instance li et al 2015 introduced the least squares support vector machine ls svm to predict mbr flux and used the pso algorithm to avoid the blindness of artificial selection parameters the bat algorithm mainly simulates the behavior of bats to find small insects for foraging by means of an echolocation system the bat algorithm searches the solution space in a way that is somewhat similar to the pso algorithm and an improved bat algorithm was also applied to correctly predict the membrane fouling zhao et al 2020a to sum up the development and application of various search algorithms and their combination can significantly enhance non linear processing capabilities and further improve the prediction accuracy 4 summary of ai techniques and future efforts needed for fouling prediction in the past 20 years ai techniques have been successfully employed in prediction and control of membrane fouling in various membrane systems the factors that affect membrane fouling are used as inputs of ai algorithm for example the variables related to operating conditions water quality parameters membrane types as well as biomass properties can be used to predict membrane fouling the ai algorithms can also identify the most important influencing factors for membrane fouling during the optimization of input parameters for example feed salinity was identified as the most significant parameter that affect water permeability constant k w during the operation of ro process under low pressure barello et al 2014 likewise it has also been reported that the most effective input variables for both permeate flux and membrane fouling resistance in osmotic membrane bioreactor were ph conductivity nh4 n and tn concentrations viet and jang 2021 in md system mlp ann identified that inlet feed temperature and the sweeping air flow were contributing factors to the flux decline besides ai based techniques can further optimize operating conditions such as operating pressure temperature flow rate backwash efficiency and chemical cleaning operations to mitigate membrane fouling altunkaynak and chellam 2010 mittal et al 2021 more recently it has been reported that ai techniques can also be used to better understand the fouling mechanisms such as quantizing of interfacial interactions during the fouling process kamali et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 and recognizing fouling images during the growth fouling layer im et al 2021 park et al 2019 shim et al 2021 in order to further develop a comprehensive understanding of different ai algorithms for the prediction of membrane fouling in various membrane technologies a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the usage of various input output variables and the application frequency of different algorithms and their predictive performance are presented in fig 7 selecting the appropriate variables can enhance the accuracy of prediction in membrane fouling fig 7a is the heatmap of inputs in different membrane based technologies the most frequently used input variables involve pressure temperature solute concentration conductivity and feed flow rate suggesting that these inputs are of great significance for predicting membrane fouling in high pressure membrane filtration system among them solute concentration might be the most important input variable for ro process slightly different from the ro systems ph and filtration time are important input parameters in the nf systems tmp ph filtration time are normally considered as inputs to better predict membrane fouling in uf systems for mf process filtration time tmp and cross flow velocity are the top three parameters in various ai algorithms input variables such as tmp solute concentrations and membrane type could achieve higher accuracy in predicting the permeate flux during crossflow mf in more complex filtration systems operating parameters and biomass characteristics such as tmp srt hrt permeate flux ph and mlss have been used as inputs to handle the non linear relationships of various fouling factors in mbrs among them ph conductivity and mlss seem to be effective input variables for achieving higher accuracy since md technology is driven by a water vapor pressure gradient the choice of inputs is mainly associated with permeate flow rate temperature and salt concentration as illustrated in fig 7b the outputs with the highest frequency are the permeate flux followed by rejection fouling resistance and tmp in various membrane systems the permeate flux is a representative parameter for the prediction of membrane fouling especially in uf mf mbr and md systems the prediction of flux accounts for more than 50 of total predicted parameters fig 7c shows the different algorisms for the prediction of membrane fouling in various membrane technologies mlp ann is the dominant algorism used in various membrane filtration systems demonstrating a wide applicability and strong adaptability various algorithms including mlp ann rbf ann cnn gp as well as ga have been applied to the prediction of membrane fouling in ro systems similarly ai algorithms that have been used to predict membrane fouling in nf process include mlp ann rbf ann cnn rnn and svm compared to other membrane technologies there is a wider variety of algorithms used in uf mf and mbr systems for instance mlp ann rbf ann rnn gp and fl are mainstream algorithms applied in uf systems besides ga is widely applied in uf systems but the application of pso algorithm is limited mlp ann rbf ann and fl are the most applied algorithms in mf systems followed by ga rnn and gp algorithms likewise mlp ann rbf ann rnn cnn fl ga and pso algorithms have been widely applied for the prediction and control of membrane fouling in mbr systems membrane fouling in mbr process is not only affected by the operating conditions but also the complex biomass characteristics due to the complexity of fouling behaviours in mbrs ga and pso algorithms are widely applied to optimize parameters with a total percentage of nearly 40 in contrast only mlp ann and search algorithms have been applied in md systems implying a great prospect for the application of ai techniques in md process fig 7d summarizes the prediction accuracies of different ai algorithms due to the universal applicability of mlp ann most mlp ann algorithms showed good prediction accuracy r2 0 95 while a few cases had poor fitting with r2 below 0 85 benefiting from the universal approximation ability the rbf ann showed stable prediction accuracies with r2 0 98 as an optimization tool for the prediction of membrane fouling majority of search algorithms achieved excellent agreement between prediction and experimental data with r2 0 99 other algorithms including fl and svm have achieved excellent prediction performance through optimization the prediction accuracy of the gp model might not be as high as other models therefore different ai algorithm should be selected for achieving the best fitting results under different scenarios based on the discussion above a guidance diagram for membrane fouling prediction based on ai technique is further plotted fig 8 for different membrane filtration systems the first step is to determine which parameters are suitable to be chosen as inputs for instance pressure temperature and solute concentration can be chosen as the inputs for ro process filtration time can be used as input variables in nf uf mf and mbr system some operating parameters and mixed liquor parameters such as hrt srt and mlss concentration are very important in the prediction of fouling behaviours in mbr based on the research of ai modeling in md processes operating parameters such as temperature permeate flow rate and solute concentration can be selected as input variables to predict membrane fouling behaviours with high accuracy the second step is to determine the prediction outcome that are directly or indirectly related to membrane fouling some parameters that directly related to membrane fouling such as tmp variation transient flux hydraulic resistance and salt rejection can be selected as outputs besides the interfacial energy between membrane and foulants interfacial interactions fouling layer thickness and fouling layer growth can also be predicted by training and selecting appropriate inputs kamali et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 mlp neural networks can be the primary choice which can adapt to different membrane filtration processes furthermore it is worth noting that the rbf neural network is more suitable for real time prediction or complex systems researchers and practitioners can select the appropriate ann types according to specific research targets when the specific research objectives are time series prediction fouling image recognition and complex filtration conditions other ai tools should be applied for instance rnn models are more advantageous when dealing with time series data or big database if researchers aim to simulate membrane fouling images based on image recognition cnn is an alternative when the simulation is conducted in a complex filtration system or at industrial scale the lstm model may be a suitable method viet et al 2021a with the development of algorithms the search algorithms such as ga and pso can make prediction of membrane fouling more accurate ga and pso algorithms can replace the bp training algorithm to optimize the weights of ann and further achieve faster convergence speed and higher accuracy ga optimized ann can solve smooth or non smooth optimization problems and achieve higher accuracy in predicting permeate flux various search algorithms can be combined to make the prediction of membrane fouling more accurate the combination of ga and pso algorithms is capable of improving the convergence speed of ga and reducing the probability of pso falling into local optimum which can effectively improve the prediction accuracy adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm is a combination of ga and sa and it has a powerful global searching capacity of ga as well as a strong local searching ability of sa as a result this hybrid search algorithms can provide more reliable predictions than single search algorithm especially when dealing with small sample data furthermore the combination of different algorithms can be used to further enhance the accuracy of the outputs anfis is a combination of ann and fl which uses the learning ability of ann and the computing power of fuzzy logic offering a more powerful tool for calculations the combination of ann and fl performs better in prediction of membrane fouling than ann alone the application of more advanced ann algorithms such as cnn and rnn are capable of capturing complex nonlinear relationship they use multiple interconnected networks for model training thereby considerably improving the training capacity and model accuracy although significant advances have been achieved in using ai based techniques for membrane fouling prediction there are still challenges to be addressed for the application of ai technology into membrane processes single ai tools such as ann has a poor reproducibility in predicting membrane fouling because the weight and bias between neurons are given randomly zhao et al 2020b besides the changes of operating parameters influent shock and membrane foulant interactions might lead to fluctuations in prediction accuracy ai models are also likely subject to overfitting if the input database is not large enough or the structure is too complex leading to the phenomenon that an intelligent model shows high accuracy on the training samples but fails to accurately predict for new samples model structure simplification input parameters optimization sensitivity analysis and data augmentation can reduce the possibility of overfitting zhong et al 2021 although deep learning can achieve high accuracy for prediction of membrane fouling the process requires large amounts of data for training and testing which might consume long time for processing schmidhuber 2015 in the current studies the selected inputs are relatively broad and has not been associated with specific compositions of foulants for example in some studies cod or mlss are selected as input parameters however the specific compositions in cod including proteins polysaccharides as well as other microbial products are ignored due to the black box nature of ai models application of ai models in predicting membrane fouling tendency cannot provide mechanistic insights into the reasons leading to the changing trend a combination of ai models and conventional mathematical models may help illustrate this issue furthermore the application of ai to predict membrane fouling or filtration processes is often limited by insufficient understanding of the membrane fouling mechanism more research efforts are needed to further address the challenges in application of ai techniques for predicting fouling in membrane based processes ga and pso are so far the most frequently investigated search algorithms for membrane fouling prediction other search algorithms such as ant colony algorithm artificial bee colony algorithm and colony optimization algorithm may be also feasible for fouling prediction the application of these search algorithms to prediction of membrane fouling deserves more research efforts hybrid ai models typically show better prediction accuracy because of its capability to overcome the shortcomings of a single intelligent model therefore more research efforts can be devoted to the combination of different ai approaches or introduction of different search algorithms to find the best solution for complex situations online monitoring systems have been well developed for fouling observation in real time it is a quite attractive topic to combine ai based technologies with real time online systems to make fast and timely predictions thereby facilitating the development of efficient and automatic membrane fouling control measures although substantial advances have been made in membrane fouling prediction and mechanisms exploration by ai technologies the study on the membrane fouling prediction in full scale plants is still limited membrane fouling is a complex dynamic process in full scale plants which calls for more efforts to promote applications of ai technique in real operations 5 conclusions this study systematically reviewed the application of ai techniques in membrane fouling prediction a series of ai algorithms ie ann search algorithm fl gp and svm have been successfully used to predict membrane fouling in a variety of membrane based processes during the past 20 years ann is the dominant algorithm in membrane fouling prediction for various membrane filtration systems the working principle of ann is flexible and the number of neurons in the input and output layers of ann can be adjusted according to the input and output variables due to its simplicity and accuracy mlp neural networks are widely used to simulate membrane fouling processes notably rbf neural networks have simple topology and faster computation speed which is more suitable for real time prediction cnn algorithm using fouling images as input variables can be used to predict the thickness porosity roughness and density of the fouling layer and to visualize the evolution of the fouling layer so far the application of ai based models to membrane fouling in fo and md are still scarce which are mainly based on ann although a single ai method has demonstrated its powerful prediction potential there

while membrane fouling is still a critical obstacle that limits its widespread applications shim et al 2021 membrane fouling occurs mainly due to the attachment accumulation and adsorption of substances onto membrane surfaces and or into their pores during the filtration process meng et al 2017 niu et al 2020 the occurrence of membrane fouling typically leads to a significant compromise of membrane filtration performance and thus the prevention or mitigation of membrane fouling is a critical measure in order to achieve a sustainable membrane operation a prediction of membrane fouling is of great significance for the selection of pretreatment measures or the development of antifouling techniques schmitt and do 2017 shim et al 2021 which has attracted increasing interests in the past decades bagheri et al 2019 mechanistic models based on membrane flux transmembrane pressure tmp pollutant salt rejection and other operating parameters have been developed to understand and predict membrane fouling behaviours in membrane based processes for water and wastewater treatment griffiths et al 2014 pimentel et al 2015 zuthi et al 2017 however due to the complexity of membrane fouling processes it is rather challenging to accurately predict the occurrence or evolution of membrane fouling using these classical mathematical models nandi et al 2010 wu et al 2021 zhao et al 2020a therefore it is very necessary to develop more effective approaches that can overcome the shortcomings of traditional models and accurately predict the performance of membrane processes the rapid development of artificial intelligence ai which has been widely used in many fields such as healthcare smart cities intelligent search big data and pattern recognition offers a great opportunity to achieve this goal alam et al 2022 with the innovation and development of technologies along with industry 4 0 more attention has been paid to system efficiency long term performance prediction and the integration of ai strategies into system operation viet et al 2021a the application of ai in the membrane processes has attracted much interests from scientists and engineers involved in the membrane field during the past 20 years for instance ai approaches have been used for the prediction of membrane filtration performance of drug molecules brocke et al 2019 design and optimization of thin film nanocomposite membranes gromiha and yabuki 2008 yeo et al 2020 forecast of the plasticization pressure ahmad et al 2015 estimation of membrane lifetime liu et al 2019 discrimination of membrane proteins gromiha and yabuki 2008 and prediction of membrane fouling schmitt and do 2017 in particular ai based techniques are emerging in membrane fouling prediction under complex and uncertain systems in different membrane filtration systems çinar et al 2006 guo et al 2015 liu and kim 2008 torregrossa et al 2018 due to its autonomous learning and self diagnosis capabilities salehi and razavi 2016 various ai algorithms such as artificial neural networks ann rahmanian et al 2011 genetic algorithm ga soleimani et al 2013 particle swarm optimization pso wang and li 2018 simulated annealing sa li et al 2017 fuzzy logic fl vaija et al 1993 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis rahimzadeh et al 2016 genetic programming gp shokrkar et al 2012 and support vector machine svm adib et al 2019 have been applied to predict membrane fouling however there is a lack of a critical review on the application of various ai based technologies in membrane fouling prediction for different membrane filtration systems this work provides a critical review of different ai based technologies applied for membrane fouling prediction the adaptive capability and prediction accuracy of ai tools for reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf microfiltration mf membrane bioreactor mbr and membrane distillation md systems were critically evaluated the research progress on modeling and optimization of membrane fouling prediction using multilayer perceptual mlp networks radial basis function rbf networks search algorithms fl gp and svm etc was also summarized furthermore the input and output variables that affect the prediction accuracy and performance were further analyzed based on literature database during the past 20 years finally research gaps and future perspectives are discussed for ai based techniques aiming for a more precise prediction of membrane fouling 2 basic information of ai techniques for prediction of membrane fouling 2 1 commonly employed ai techniques in membrane filtration the artificial neuron model was proposed in 1943 kicking off a new era in ann research in 1950 alan turing proposed a method to identify a machine as intelligent in his paper computing machinery and intelligence the term artificial intelligence was formally proposed in 1956 at a conference held at dartmouth university zhang and lu 2021 in the 1950s and 1960s the creation of ai prototypes sparked the first wave of ai booming back propagation bp neural networks appeared in the 1980s which further stimulated the research of artificial neural network algorithm the most recent and ongoing ai boom started in 2006 when deep learning dl methods were proposed and since then ai has continued to advance in image recognition and big data processing kubassova et al 2021 ai techniques attempts to mine massive historical data for implied patterns and use them for prediction or classification which is also considered to be more like a function where the input is the sample data and the output is the desired result over the past 20 years ai techniques have been used to predict membrane fouling and evaluate membrane filtration performance the term ai is a broad concept which generally includes big data machine learning representation learning expert systems as well as computer vision it is dependent on certain methods and steps which are called as algorithms to perform each operation in ai techniques zhang and lu 2021 fig 1 shows the commonly used algorithms for ai techniques in prediction of membrane fouling generally algorithms for ai techniques mainly include artificial neural networks ann fuzzy logic fl support vector machines svm genetic programming gp and search algorithms zhong et al 2021 search algorithms including genetic algorithms ga and particle swarm optimization pso are important optimization approaches search algorithms can be used to optimize the performance of modeling techniques to jointly guide the optimization of operating conditions in membrane separation processes besides these search algorithms can be coupled with other modeling algorithms such as ann fl and svm generally these hybrid algorithms can achieve better performance due to the advantage of various search algorithms 2 2 advantages of ai techniques over mathematical models in prediction of membrane fouling intensive research efforts have been devoted to the development of ai or mathematical models in order to better describe membrane fouling behaviours and some of them has shown the satisfactory results in predicting the change of tmp hazrati et al 2017 evolution of permeate flux boyle gotla et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 fouling resistance peleato et al 2017 and formation of cake layer griffiths et al 2014 pimentel et al 2015 zuthi et al 2017 conventional mathematical modeling usually utilizes mathematical or empirical methods besides the equations of some mathematical models were usually complex and time consuming to be solved compared to ai models conventional mathematical models were not always successful in predicting membrane fouling behaviours due to the complexities of membrane fouling park et al 2019 moreover using conventional mathematical models to predict membrane fouling are commonly flawed because these models usually simplify the membrane fouling process given that the time varying nature of the interactions between foulants and membranes is poorly understood guglielmi et al 2007 ai has several advantages over the conventional mechanistic models such as the learning ability and the capability to deal with imprecise and highly complex non linear data unlike mathematical models ai has been regarded as a black box bagheri et al 2019 and predicts membrane fouling through learning mechanism based on dataset rather than using mathematical equations in recent years ai techniques have been gradually applied to pilot scale and even full scale membrane filtration systems and achieved high accuracy in the prediction of permeate flux permeate flow rate and membrane rejection roehl et al 2018 schmitt et al 2018 srivastava et al 2021 when the number of input parameters is small mathematical models can be effective in predicting or simulating membrane fouling if a large number of input parameters are used the development of the mechanistic models will be very complex and difficult most of mechanistic models were developed and tested at laboratory or pilot scale which lacks self learning capabilities and might not be able to monitor or control membrane fouling in real time in full scale plants therefore it is favorable to use intelligent methods such as powerful computational intelligence paradigms to resolve such complex non linear relationships 2 3 evolution of ai techniques for fouling prediction based on literature survey the number of publications in prediction of membrane fouling field has rapidly increased in the past two decades fig s1 and visual analysis of the co occurrence of keywords can well reflect the research progress of membrane fouling prediction fig 2 as shown in fig 2a the keywords are classified into three large clusters during the bibliometric mapping the red cluster is mainly comprised of keywords related to membrane fouling such as membrane surface cake layer interaction and fouling mechanism the green cluster mainly consisted of the keywords associated with the basic information of ai based models such as ann layer neuron processing time training procedure genetic algorithm etc and the indicators of output such as flux decline transmembrane pressure fouling resistance etc the keywords related to the analysis process such as experimental design optimization and performance index are clustered under the blue section furthermore as shown in fig 2b the overlay visualization network map indicates that the research of membrane fouling prediction before 2010 mainly focused on pilot plant flux decline and crossflow velocity during the last decade i e 2011 2021 the keywords membrane bioreactor technology fouling mechanism artificial intelligence and wastewater treatment plant increased in popularity this might suggest that ai based methods have been gradually applied to investigation of membrane fouling mechanisms in wastewater treatment plants in recent years 3 the application of ai algorithms in prediction of membrane fouling 3 1 artificial neural network due to the ability of robust autonomous learning many researchers have used ann to deal with environmental problems by solving multivariate non linear problems aleboyeh et al 2008 viet et al 2021b currently ann is the mainstream ai algorithm because of its ease of implementation and relatively high accuracy ann has a powerful information storage and computational capability by using black box learning methods to some extent it resembles human learning behaviour that can solve multivariate non linear problems zhang and pan 2014 meanwhile ann does not require a mathematical description of the phenomena involved in the process and therefore it takes less time to solve the targeted problem compared to traditional mathematical modeling as shown in fig 3 a b ann is derived from biological neural systems and consists of a large number of interconnected artificial neurons lópez et al 2017 each ann consists of artificial neurons that have been reorganized into layers and linked together a single layer of artificial neurons in an ann is insufficient to detect the intricate interactions between inputs and outputs in the network in most cases three layers of connected neurons consisting of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer are utilized to predict the outputs mlp network fig 3c and rbf network fig 3d alam et al 2022 are two widely used ann networks with more details described in supporting information si generally deep learning technologies apply advanced ann algorisms such as recurrent neural networks rnn and convolutional neural networks cnn for feature identification big data analysis or pattern recognition fan et al 2018 kamrava et al 2021 schmidhuber 2015 in the rnn model the output parameters from the previous step are transferred as input to a current step as shown in fig 4 a the rnn model consists of input parameters activation function and output values each activation function f is a long short term memory gate which trains the model by using back propagation with a forget gate input gate and output gate besides cnn is another representative algorithm of dl technology which includes convolutional computation and has a deep structure fig 4b shows the architecture of the cnn model which is one of the most powerful models for solving problems related to image classification object recognition and natural language cnn utilizes layers with convolving filters for local feature extraction then the classification layer makes decision based on the parameters collected from the previous layers alam et al 2022 besides cnn layers are connected to a small region in the previous layer which can reduce wasteful neurons and prevent overfitting park et al 2019 ann and its derivatives have been used in many studies to forecast the separation performance and fouling behaviour of the membrane kamali et al 2021 most of the studies that developed ann to predict membrane fouling achieved high accuracy during the past two decades to get an overall understanding fig 5 summarizes the prediction accuracy of ann modeling for representative membrane fouling parameters such as permeate flux membrane rejection permeate flow rate tmp and fouling resistance in different membrane filtration systems the indexes that are frequently used to measure the differences between predicted data and the experimental data are listed in table s1 since coefficient of determination r2 is the most widely used performance indicator in these studies it was selected to evaluate the discrepancy between the predicted data and the actual data in ro systems the representative parameters of membrane fouling are permeate flux membrane rejection permeate flow rate and permeate total dissolved solids tds compared with other outputs ann has the best performance in predicting permeate flux in ro with r2 0 97 in nf and uf systems the representative parameters of membrane fouling are permeate flux and membrane rejection the prediction accuracy of permeate flux was better than membrane rejection apart from permeate flux and membrane rejection tmp is also a representative parameter in the membrane fouling prediction during mf process due to the numerous influencing factors and complex non linear relationships related to the fouling process the prediction accuracy varies and needs to be further improved in mbr with r2 of permeate flux ranged from 0 85 to 0 99 moreover fouling resistance was often used as an output to evaluate the overall performance of mbr system currently representative outputs on membrane fouling of md are dominated by permeate flux and permeate flow rate and the majority of ann based models have achieved good prediction accuracy for permeate flux with r2 0 97 the following parts describe the research progress of ann in predicting membrane fouling of different membrane filtration systems in detail 3 1 1 reverse osmosis and forward osmosis table 1 summarizes publications of ann modeling focusing on fouling control of ro fo and nf systems mlp ann is currently the dominant algorithm applied in ro forward osmosis fo and nf systems over the past 20 years in 1995 niemi et al 1995 established an mlp ann model for simulating the membrane flux of the ro system and the relative error re between the predicted value and actual value was 7 5 the water permeability constant k w is an important parameter that affects the operation of the ro process an mlp ann trained with back propagation method have successfully predicted the dynamic k w values for a ro desalination plant barello et al 2014 it was also found that the effect of feed salinity on k w value was more significant under low pressure in general a number of studies have shown that the ann is a competitive efficient and powerful tool in predicting the membrane fouling behaviour the first study that compared response surface methodology rsm and ann in ro desalination process was conducted by khayet et al 2011 the ann model was found to be a global model showing higher accuracy r2 0 9998 in prediction of the ro desalination performance than the rsm in a wide range of salt concentrations likewise a comparative modeling study was carried out by k et al 2021 to compare the prediction accuracy of ann and rsm models during fo process the results showed that ann performed better than rsm one model can show different prediction accuracy on different target variables for example garg and joshi garg and joshi 2014 developed an ann model for performance evaluation of a small scale brackish water ro process in this study the ann model successfully predicted water recovery r2 0 9611 tds rejection r2 0 9246 and specific energy consumption r2 0 9044 respectively furthermore to find the most suitable ann structure for the prediction of membrane fouling aish et al 2015 trained and developed mlp and rbf neural networks to predict total tds concentrations and permeate flow rate of a ro desalination plant compared with the conventional statistical model r 0 8976 ann models showed a better simulation of permeate flow rate further research revealed that the accuracy of mlp predictive neural network r 0 9904 was slightly better than that of the rbf model r 0 9853 likewise for a fo process jawad et al 2020 applied mlp model to predict permeate flux and acheived an accuracy of 97 3 r2 it also demonstrated that a larger number of neurons and a smaller number of hidden layers were beneficial to improving the accuracy of ann in full scale plants ann modeling can guide data collection to better predict and control membrane fouling by identifying the most important parameters for example ann models were trained with six years of data to identify the causes of membrane fouling in a full scale ro system and the models provided feasible strategies to control membrane fouling roehl et al 2018 total chlorine electrical conductance and tds were essential parameters for early fouling while turbidity nitrate organic nitrogen and nitrite were important predictors for later fouling as an advanced version of the ann dl techniques based on fouling image recognition have also been developed for the prediction of membrane fouling park et al 2019 first applied cnn to model fouling growth and flux decline based on real time optical coherence tomography oct images the results showed that cnn could improve the prediction accuracy on fouling layer growth of nf ro membranes with r2 0 99 likewise a cnn model had been developed for the prediction of thickness porosity roughness and density of the fouling layer of fo membrane by using real time oct images im et al 2021 the prediction results showed high r2 values in predicting membrane fouling characteristics thickness 0 90 porosity 0 86 roughness 0 92 and density 0 90 3 1 2 nanofiltration to predict long term membrane fouling resistance shetty and chellam 2003 applied an ann model in a nf process the ann trained with 10 of the total data and 93 of the outputs achieved high accuracy within 5 absolute relative error in a cross flow nf process filtrating waste brine an ann with tmp time and temperature as the inputs was used to predict flux and total hydraulic resistance salehi and razavi 2012 and the results showed that the ann with 1 hidden layer consisting of 9 neurons had the best fitting results which obtained the r2 of 0 96 and 0 98 for flux and hydraulic resistance respectively khaouane et al 2017 investigated the fouling phenomenon caused by the interaction between traces of organic compounds and membrane surfaces in this study a bootstrap based ann was developed to predict the rejections of charged and uncharged organic compounds the trained ann obtained satisfactory results between the predicted and experimental rejections with r 0 9862 yangali quintanilla et al 2009 applied ann models to predict the rejection of neutral organic compounds by nf and ro process they also identified that the most important input variable was salt rejection it should be noted that two neurons were sufficient in the hidden layer and four neurons did not improve performance an ann model with one hidden layer of four neurons had successfully tracked the non linear behavior of the rejection of salts nacl and mgcl2 in a cross flow nf process darwish et al 2007 the superiority of ann over other models in simulating nf process has been demonstrated for example it was reported that the ann predicted nf performance at low values of salt rejection and water flux was more accurately than the spiegler kedem model did al zoubi et al 2007 srivastava et al 2021 explored the potential of ann and rsm for modeling a pilot scale nf ro hybrid system ann with four input neurons ten hidden neurons and three output neurons showed more satisfactory performance in optimizing the nf ro system than rsm based on 38 430 datapoints hu et al 2021 employed three different ai models ann svm and random forest to forecast the separation performance of an organic solvent nf process ann obtained high accuracy in predicting the permeance r2 0 90 and rejection r2 0 91 long short term memory lstm is a special type of rnn which is mainly designed to solve the gradient disappearance problems during the training of long sequences shim et al 2021 developed a new fouling model based on lstm to analyze nf filtration performance and fouling development based on time series datasets this lstm model achieved relatively high prediction accuracy for permeate flux and fouling layer thickness with r2 0 97 3 1 3 ultrafiltration accurately modelling the uf separation process is very important for solving fouling issues and optimizing operating conditions detailed information of the application of ann in the uf processes are presented in table 2 an ann was developed to model the time evolution of tmp of uf plants for drinking water production delgrange et al 1998b in this study turbidity permeate flow rate tmp at the filtration start point and tmp before last backwash have been shown sufficient to predict the evolution of mean tmp in addition mlp ann has been successfully used in capturing the non linear dynamics of the cross flow uf razavi et al 2004 and controlling permeate flux decline in the uf process curcio et al 2006 liu and kim 2008 compared the performance of mathematic and mechanical model blocking laws with ann model for uf process compare with the blocking laws ann model achieved excellent agreement between prediction and experimental tmp values in comparison with the classical pore blocking models which need to be fitted for each experimental test ann is capable of simulating all the experimental data instantly to further verify the applicability of these two tools in the prediction of membrane fouling meighani et al 2013 compared ann and classical pore blocking models in simulating flux decline and the results showed that ann had a higher accuracy r2 0 9999 likewise a comparison between ann and hermia s models were also carried out to model flux decline during crossflow ultrafiltration corbatón báguena et al 2016 results showed that the accuracy of ann was comparable to that of hermia s models and the optimum number of neurons in the intermediate layer was 8 in addition to predicting the permeate flux and tmp of the uf process peleato et al 2017 incoporated continuous fluorescence characterization data into neural networks to predict short term fouling fluctuations during uf process it demonstrated that the trained neural networks were a potentially powerful modeling approach in predicting the development of fouling resistance to provide an early warning of the membrane fouling chew et al 2017 combined darcy s law and ann to predict the specific cake resistance and total suspended solids in a uf pilot plant by inputting the data of feed water turbidity filtration time and tmp this hybrid model could be easily implemented in the industrial scale uf treatment plant as it did not need any additional costly analysis equipment 3 1 4 microfiltration ann model has also been extensively employed for the prediction and control of the fouling occurring in the mf process as shown in table 2 mainly three types of ann including mlp rbf and rnn have been ultilized in prediction of membrane fouling in mf processes the most widely used inputs include tmp cross flow velocity and temperature while the popular outputs involve permeate flux tmp evolution and hydraulic resistance in 1995 dornier et al 1995 first introduced mlp ann to dynamically model the total hydraulic resistance of the membrane in a crossflow mf system a well trained ann shows a great potential to predict highly non linear membrane fouling behaviors such as tmp variations and flux decline chellam 2005 used ann to accurately capture transient permeate flux decline caused by polydisperse colloids and quantify the impact of particles on fouling caused by non linear fluid dynamics the results also revealed that the initial permeation flux was the most critical influence factor on membrane fouling while the shear rate showed weaker effects chellam 2005 liu et al 2009 also found that feed water turbidity permeate flux and backwash frequency duration were equally important to predict tmp variations when used as the input variables aydiner et al 2005 compared the performance of ann and kol tuniewicz model in simulating of flux decline during crossflow mf ann could achieve higher accuracy in predicting the permeate flux from process variables such as tmp feed solution concentration and membrane type in another research it has been reported that the prediction accuracy of permeation flux using ann was better than that of the cake filtration model nandi et al 2010 likewise it was reported that ann model could achieve excellent agreement r2 0 996 in predicting the permeate flux decline in the mf system which performed better than the classical fouling models i e complete blocking r2 0 186 intermediate blocking r2 0 988 standard blocking r2 0 866 and cake filtration r2 0 858 ghandehari et al 2011 cheng et al 2008 proposed a modified rbf ann to predict effect of interparticle interactions on flux decline in mf the results showed that the prediction accuracies of the ann could be further improved if more data was available at different ranges of hydrodynamic and physicochemical operating conditions in a comparative research rbf ann was more accurate than the conventional bp ann and multiple regression method in producing a good predictability of the long term flux decline chen and kim 2006 ghandehari et al 2013 also demonstrated the superiority of rbf networks over the conventional bp networks in predicting flux decline in the cross flow mf system filtrating bovine serum albumin bsa 3 1 5 membrane bioreactor membrane fouling is still a key obstacle that have restricted the wider application of mbr process applying ai in mbr systems for the optimization of system efficiency and prediction of membrane fouling behaviour has attracted increasing attention in the past two decades with relevant studies summarized in table 3 the selection of potential input dataset is essential for ann model development for example pioneer work was done by geissler et al 2005 who achieved satisfying and promising results of predicting the permeate flux and its decay in a pilot mbr by establishing an elman network enn in this study tmp rate of tmp change filtration cycle length backwash cycle length sludge retention time srt total suspended solids temperature and oxygen decay rate were selected as input variables however mixed liquor parameters that related to membrane fouling such as chemical oxygen demand cod or mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were not considered in this study hazrati et al 2017 reported that hydraulic retention time hrt and mlss highly affected the tmp prediction during ann modeling in another study an mlp ann has been successfully developed to predict tmp variations in a pilot scale anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor schmitt et al 2018 however they also reported that important wastewater parameters such as mlss cod ph and dissolved oxygen do could not be associated well with tmp besides the ann with total nitrogen tn total phosphorus and nitrate as input variables achieved high accuracy r2 0 850 and rmse 0 099 cmhg in predicting tmp variations viet and jang 2021 identified the most effective input variables for predicting permeate flux and membrane fouling which include ph conductivity nh4 n and tn concentrations besides the operating parameters are also important influencing factors of membrane fouling in the long term operation of mbrs it was observed that an mlp ann model with backwash time and service time as input variables predicted permeate flux accurately aidan et al 2008 model structure is also an important parameter which affects accurate prediction for instance ann models were further introduced to predict flux and membrane fouling resistance of an osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr which also proved efficient with r2 values 0 90 viet and jang 2021 this study suggested that the optimal model structure for permeate flux was an ann model containing 2 hidden layers and 30 neurons while an ann model containing 2 hidden layers and 5 neurons was optimal for membrane fouling resistance in addition to predicting variations of tmp permeate flux and membrane fouling resistance ann has been used to better understand the fouling mechanisms fouling is associated with not only the hydrodynamic forces due to aeration and or filtration but also the short range interfacial interactions between the foulant and the membrane surface chen et al 2016 mirbagheri et al 2015 wang et al 2013 the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory is widely used for the purpose of quantifying such interactions chen et al 2017 the advanced xdlvo method which combines triangulation techniques and surface elemental integration sei methods with the extended xdlvo theory has been developed in pursuit of this goal teng et al 2018 due to the complex non linear relationship between membrane surface morphology and interfacial interactions the computations with the advanced xdlvo method are time consuming teng et al 2019 alternatively ann is a promising tool for the understanding of the hydrodynamics and short range interfacial interactions during the fouling process kamali et al 2021 if the trained ann can give a satisfactory description of the complex relationships and interfacial interactions among various factors in the fouling process the computational burden will be greatly reduced rbf ann had been firstly employed for the proof of concept and showed quick and efficient responses to quantify the interfacial energy zhao et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 introduced a rbf ann to predict the interfacial interactions between sludge flocs and membranes the quantification of the interfacial interactions by the trained rbf ann saved up to 98 of computation time compared to the advanced xdlvo method to reduce salt accumulation and membrane fouling viet et al 2021a proposed a rnn model to predict the water flux and permeate conductivity of an osmotic membrane bioreactor in this study the rmse values between the actual and predicted values were 0 16699 l m2 h for water flux this result suggested that the rnn model could be applied not only in the independent process of fo but also in the integrated processes such as ombr viet et al 2021a 3 1 6 membrane distillation md is a novel separation process using vapor pressure difference between the warmer feedwater and cooler permeate as a driving force similar to other membrane processes fouling is still a bottleneck that limits the application of md which can lead to a declined water flux and an accelerated pore wetting warsinger et al 2015 therefore it is also quite necessary to find an effective method to predict the md performance and membrane fouling behaviour conventional mathematical models e g computational fluid dynamics ballistic transport model and structural network model used in md are highly dependent on the transport mechanisms and phenomena in the system which might result in a relatively low prediction accuracy hitsov et al 2015 predicting membrane fouling and analyzing its effects on permeate flux is crucial for md process khayet and cojocaru 2012 studied a feed forward ann modeling of permeate flux in air gap md system it was concluded that ann model was able to predict the permeate flux at a high accuracy r2 0 992 based on process variables such as the air gap thickness cooling inlet temperature feed inlet temperature and feed flow rate likewise an mlp ann 3 9 1 has been developed by means of bp training method to predict the md performance i e product of the distillate flux and the salt rejection khayet and cojocaru 2013 the well trained ann model revealed that the performance was associated with the inlet feed temperature and the sweeping air flow rate choi et al 2017 reported the capability of the ann model to accurately predict the colloidal silica fouling rate in direct contact md system r2 0 99 while r2 values obtained by the cake formation model were only between 0 93 and 0 99 in addition kim et al 2020 applied ann and rsm to predict the occurrence of pore wetting in direct contact md because of the nonlinear characteristics of the wetting phenomenon ann showed higher accuracy more recently mittal et al 2021 employed an ann model coupled with ga to analyze the effects of operating parameters such as feed pressure feed temperature flow rate and operation time on membrane fouling in md this hybrid protocol successfully modeled the md process with r2 value of above 0 98 and concluded optimum operating conditions at different solute concentrations table 4 summarizes the detailed information of ann modeling for membrane fouling prediction in the md processes obviously mlp neural network was the dominant ai tool in membrane fouling prediction for md process generally most ann models selected evaporator temperature vacuum pressure feed flow rate and solute concentration as the most frequently input parameters currently representative outputs on membrane fouling of md are dominated by permeate flux and permeate flow rate and the majority of ann based models have achieved good prediction accuracy for permeate flux with r2 0 97 the effect of driving force for mass transfer on the membrane fouling process and fouling mechanisms have not been well reported compared to other type of membrane filtration processes the application of ai tool in md in the past years is relatively limited although rms and ga methods have been gradually introduced into the membrane fouling prediction in the past two years these studies are still insufficient therefore different ai algorithms including search algorithms fl gp and as well as their hybrid forms need to be further studied to determine the most suitable algorithms for md system 3 2 fuzzy logic fuzzy logic fl a method based on multi valued logic has many advantages over classical methods especially when vague data or prior knowledge is involved fuzzy systems use the concepts of fl theory to convert natural language into mathematical models madaeni and kurdian 2011 in comparison to ann fl has the advantage of being able to handle noisy and distorted multivariate data altunkaynak and chellam 2010 fig 4c demonstrates the architecture of fl in modeling of membrane fouling technically the fl system includes four components fuzzification fuzzy rule base fuzzy output engine and defuzzification akkurt et al 2004 the details of each working step in fl are further described in si fl has been applied in the membrane filtration process to investigate the membrane fouling behaviours altunkaynak and chellam 2010 programmed fl to predict time variant specific fluxes profiles with initial permeate flux entrance shear rate instantaneous pressure and filtration time as inputs the robust fl model provided a platform for quantitatively capturing the cumulative effects of colloidal particle sizes on membrane fouling during the crossflow mf process the high predictive performance coefficient of efficiency 0 96 of fl could further optimize the backwash efficiency and chemical cleaning operations of mf systems altunkaynak and chellam 2010 besides fuzzy set logic has been introduced into an advanced control system enabling to supervise and optimize mbr filtration process brauns et al 2011 the advanced control system using fl could continuously modify the system settings and achieved intelligent control according to the filtration performance madaeni and kurdian 2011 integrated the ga method into the design of the fuzzy model benefiting from the ga this hybrid model accurately predicted flux and rejection of mf membrane well consistent with experimental data r2 0 9748 for flux r2 0 9309 for rejection fl was further coupled with ann to optimize filtration operations because of its good interpretability anfis is a hybrid of two powerful ann and fis algorithms which combines the computational power of ann and reasoning capabilities of fl rego et al 2018 anfis is recommended as a powerful tool for generating more accurate outcomes than ann and has successfully been utilized for enhancing membrane filtration efficiency in comparison with the ann model the anfis model could provide more reliable predictions for the separation of lead ions by uf rahmanian et al 2012 sargolzaei et al 2012 applied bp ann rbf and anfis to predict the cod removal efficiency and permeate flux of mf process in this work the well trained anfis performed better than the other two models error 1 rahimzadeh et al 2016 applied anfis to investigate the mf process treating oily wastewater with the inputs of tmp oil concentration and filtration time this model successfully simulated permeate volume with r2 0 999 to investigate the performance of a hydrophilic polyethersulfone membrane hedayati moghaddam et al 2017 employed fuzzy inference system fis to predict permeate flux where defuzzification operator was the center of rotation centroid with the best agreement achieved r2 0 975 anfis and mlp ann models were constructed to simulate and predict water flux of ombr in this study electrical conductivity and mlss were key input parameters for the anfis model and the combination of ann and fl performed slightly better than ann alone in water flux prediction with r2 of 0 9755 for anfis and 0 9861 for ann in predicting water flux hosseinzadeh et al 2020 in most cases anfis demonstrates better prediction strength in predicting water flux permeate volume and rejection than ann combining fl with ann would further improve the prediction accuracy of ann 3 3 genetic programming gp is a branch of evolutionary computation which is used to optimize a system based on user provided fitness criteria a detailed description of the gp and its workflow is presented in si gp has been applied to model the membrane fouling resistance in a pilot scale drinking water treatment plant lee et al 2009a and forecast the flux decline shokrkar et al 2012 gp accurately predicted the dynamic filtration process of a municipal wastewater treatment plant as a self organizing modeling tool hong and bhamidimarri 2003 lee et al 2009a applied gp to model the membrane fouling rate of pilot scale mf systems which was proven to be an effective tool for the analysis and prediction of membrane resistance under different water characteristics and operating conditions furthermore scaling is a challenging issue to the operation of ro systems cho et al 2010 developed a gp model to explore the effect of caso4 scale formation on the ro process the trained gp model confirmed that the concentration factor applied pressure and humic acid concentration were the main influencing factors on membrane fouling compared to stirring speed and filtration time in another study 12 month data collected from a pilot scale drinking water treatment system were used to train the gp model and the accuracy rate of the model reached 92 shokrkar et al 2012 moreover the gp model had a great potential in delivering a functional relationship for the permeation flux and the predicted value agreed well with the real data 95 accruacy shokrkar et al 2012 3 4 support vector machine svm belongs to the distinct category of ai which is a powerful learning method that can be used to deal with regression or classification problems in non linear models asfaram et al 2016 as presented in fig 4d the core of svm is to map the input variables to a higher dimensional feature space via the kernel function k xi xj and then perform linear regression in this space the detailed working mechanism of svm is shown in si svm model has been successfully employed to detect and assess the membrane fouling in real time gao et al 2007 in comparison with bp ann the structure optimized svm showed more excellent agreements between the predicted values and permeate flux with the small size of the training set gao et al 2016 aya et al 2016 investigated the effects of fe2 and mn2 on the membrane fouling by applying svm regression this robust svm approach was also employed to optimize the filtration monitoring procedure in a submerged membrane reactor adib et al 2019 developed an svm model to predict the grafting yield of benzophenone and hyperbranched polyethylene glycol peg on the membrane surface the results suggested that more hydrophilic polyethersulfone pes membranes would result in better performance in addition various ai hybrid techniques had been used to achieve the combined benefits alam et al 2022 for instance fazeli et al 2013 employed the least squares support vector machine lssvm to predict pseudo steady flux and pseudo steady fouling in this study the ga was implemented to tune the optimal model parameters and achieved satisfactory accuracy r2 0 999 the results showed that temperature and tmp were the most influencing factors on pseudo steady flux and pseudo steady fouling resistance 3 5 search algorithm to improve prediction accuracy modeling algorithms can be combined with other search algorithms search algorithms are intelligent optimization methods and can find the optimal solution of multiple solution problems search algorithms inspired by social behaviour or natural phenomena are highly paralleled adaptive robust and fault tolerant which can help to solve complex non linear problems different search algorithms have different sources of ideas which are used to solve practical problems by simulating different biological or physical behaviours in nature fig 6 lists the advantages and limitations of some typical search algorithms used in membrane fouling prediction the availability of open source libraries and improvements of algorithms are making ai technology more efficient as shown in fig 6a ga is a kind of search algorithm based on the principles of natural selection and biogenetics with the advantages of global search capability fast convergence and support for multi objective optimization however the search speed of the ga is relatively slow and more training time is required to obtain an accurate solution beg et al 2016 pso algorithm is a simple and robust optimization algorithm motivated by the principles of foraging behavior of bird flocks the sa is a global search algorithm derived from the annealing process in thermodynamics li et al 2017 fig 6b d shows decision flow charts of these search algorithms for example ga starts with a set of random solutions called population the selection crossover and mutation play an important role in generating new population for pso algorithm the individual in the population is called a particle cura 2012 the global optimal position is updated by changing the speed and position of each particle and the cycle continues until the optimal value is obtained sa starts with a randomly generated initial solution the sa determines whether to accept a new solution by metropolis acceptance criteria and finally gets the optimal solution which helps the sa algorithm avoid getting trapped in local optimal solutions more methodology algorithm principle and professional knowledge of ga pso algorithm and sa are described in si table 5 lists the applications of search algorithms for membrane fouling prediction and simulation which can be used to optimize ann fl and other ai tools in order to find the optimal operating conditions the integration of ga and neural network is currently a hot topic in predicting membrane fouling behaviours for example based on darwin s idea of the survival of the fittest strugholtz et al 2008 combined neural networks with ga which could reduce the operational cost by approximately 15 through optimizing the settings of filtration time flux and aluminum dosage chen and seidel 2002 reported that ga ann predicted the permeate flux decline more accurately than the ann models calibrated by the trial and error approach similarly soleimani et al 2013 developed a ga ann hybrid model to predict the permeation flux and fouling resistance during the crossflow uf process the study suggested that ga optimized ann can solve smooth or non smooth optimization problems and better predict the optimum operating parameters for achieving maximum flux and minimum membrane fouling soleimani et al 2013 the results also showed that one hidden layer of 8 neurons is an appropriate network structure in modeling uf based oily wastewater treatment process based on the water quality and operating parameters hwang et al 2009 employed ga method to predict permeate flux and membrane fouling simultaneously the prediction of membrane fouling using ga can be further used to optimize the preparation of antifouling membranes arefi oskoui et al 2017 madaeni et al 2010 the bp neural network successfully simulated the permeate flux of the mbr system li et al 2014 however limited by the slow training speed sensitivity of initial weights and the threshold of bp its accuracy and speed are still far from satisfactory to further improve the efficacy of bp ga method was incorporated to optimize the initial weights and threshold of bp neural network the results showed that ga based network was more suitable for the prediction of permeate flux in mbr with the average re reduced from 7 4 to 3 3 li et al 2014 the application of ga helped optimizing input parameters feed temperature tmp cross flow velocity feed ph and filtration time for the mlp ann and further improved the forecast accuracy of permeation flux badrnezhad and mirza 2014 for a submerged mbr system ga optimized the weights and thresholds of mlp ann and rbf ann models leading to an improved prediction accuracy of tmp and membrane permeability mirbagheri et al 2015 the pso algorithm is capable of finding the global optimal solution rapidly while the ga has global convergence wang and li 2018 combined ga and pso algorithms with the rnn model and such hybrid algorithm improved the convergence speed of ga and reduced the probability of pso falling into local optimum which effectively fulfilled the data prediction task and further improved the prediction accuracy li et al 2017 combined ga with sa algorithms to predict membrane fouling and the adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm asaga had a powerful global searching capacity of ga as well as a strong local searching ability of sa this study demonstrated that the asaga svm model had a higher prediction accuracy than sa svm when dealing with small sample data in addition to neural networks the pso algorithm can be further applied to optimize other ai tools for instance li et al 2015 introduced the least squares support vector machine ls svm to predict mbr flux and used the pso algorithm to avoid the blindness of artificial selection parameters the bat algorithm mainly simulates the behavior of bats to find small insects for foraging by means of an echolocation system the bat algorithm searches the solution space in a way that is somewhat similar to the pso algorithm and an improved bat algorithm was also applied to correctly predict the membrane fouling zhao et al 2020a to sum up the development and application of various search algorithms and their combination can significantly enhance non linear processing capabilities and further improve the prediction accuracy 4 summary of ai techniques and future efforts needed for fouling prediction in the past 20 years ai techniques have been successfully employed in prediction and control of membrane fouling in various membrane systems the factors that affect membrane fouling are used as inputs of ai algorithm for example the variables related to operating conditions water quality parameters membrane types as well as biomass properties can be used to predict membrane fouling the ai algorithms can also identify the most important influencing factors for membrane fouling during the optimization of input parameters for example feed salinity was identified as the most significant parameter that affect water permeability constant k w during the operation of ro process under low pressure barello et al 2014 likewise it has also been reported that the most effective input variables for both permeate flux and membrane fouling resistance in osmotic membrane bioreactor were ph conductivity nh4 n and tn concentrations viet and jang 2021 in md system mlp ann identified that inlet feed temperature and the sweeping air flow were contributing factors to the flux decline besides ai based techniques can further optimize operating conditions such as operating pressure temperature flow rate backwash efficiency and chemical cleaning operations to mitigate membrane fouling altunkaynak and chellam 2010 mittal et al 2021 more recently it has been reported that ai techniques can also be used to better understand the fouling mechanisms such as quantizing of interfacial interactions during the fouling process kamali et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 and recognizing fouling images during the growth fouling layer im et al 2021 park et al 2019 shim et al 2021 in order to further develop a comprehensive understanding of different ai algorithms for the prediction of membrane fouling in various membrane technologies a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the usage of various input output variables and the application frequency of different algorithms and their predictive performance are presented in fig 7 selecting the appropriate variables can enhance the accuracy of prediction in membrane fouling fig 7a is the heatmap of inputs in different membrane based technologies the most frequently used input variables involve pressure temperature solute concentration conductivity and feed flow rate suggesting that these inputs are of great significance for predicting membrane fouling in high pressure membrane filtration system among them solute concentration might be the most important input variable for ro process slightly different from the ro systems ph and filtration time are important input parameters in the nf systems tmp ph filtration time are normally considered as inputs to better predict membrane fouling in uf systems for mf process filtration time tmp and cross flow velocity are the top three parameters in various ai algorithms input variables such as tmp solute concentrations and membrane type could achieve higher accuracy in predicting the permeate flux during crossflow mf in more complex filtration systems operating parameters and biomass characteristics such as tmp srt hrt permeate flux ph and mlss have been used as inputs to handle the non linear relationships of various fouling factors in mbrs among them ph conductivity and mlss seem to be effective input variables for achieving higher accuracy since md technology is driven by a water vapor pressure gradient the choice of inputs is mainly associated with permeate flow rate temperature and salt concentration as illustrated in fig 7b the outputs with the highest frequency are the permeate flux followed by rejection fouling resistance and tmp in various membrane systems the permeate flux is a representative parameter for the prediction of membrane fouling especially in uf mf mbr and md systems the prediction of flux accounts for more than 50 of total predicted parameters fig 7c shows the different algorisms for the prediction of membrane fouling in various membrane technologies mlp ann is the dominant algorism used in various membrane filtration systems demonstrating a wide applicability and strong adaptability various algorithms including mlp ann rbf ann cnn gp as well as ga have been applied to the prediction of membrane fouling in ro systems similarly ai algorithms that have been used to predict membrane fouling in nf process include mlp ann rbf ann cnn rnn and svm compared to other membrane technologies there is a wider variety of algorithms used in uf mf and mbr systems for instance mlp ann rbf ann rnn gp and fl are mainstream algorithms applied in uf systems besides ga is widely applied in uf systems but the application of pso algorithm is limited mlp ann rbf ann and fl are the most applied algorithms in mf systems followed by ga rnn and gp algorithms likewise mlp ann rbf ann rnn cnn fl ga and pso algorithms have been widely applied for the prediction and control of membrane fouling in mbr systems membrane fouling in mbr process is not only affected by the operating conditions but also the complex biomass characteristics due to the complexity of fouling behaviours in mbrs ga and pso algorithms are widely applied to optimize parameters with a total percentage of nearly 40 in contrast only mlp ann and search algorithms have been applied in md systems implying a great prospect for the application of ai techniques in md process fig 7d summarizes the prediction accuracies of different ai algorithms due to the universal applicability of mlp ann most mlp ann algorithms showed good prediction accuracy r2 0 95 while a few cases had poor fitting with r2 below 0 85 benefiting from the universal approximation ability the rbf ann showed stable prediction accuracies with r2 0 98 as an optimization tool for the prediction of membrane fouling majority of search algorithms achieved excellent agreement between prediction and experimental data with r2 0 99 other algorithms including fl and svm have achieved excellent prediction performance through optimization the prediction accuracy of the gp model might not be as high as other models therefore different ai algorithm should be selected for achieving the best fitting results under different scenarios based on the discussion above a guidance diagram for membrane fouling prediction based on ai technique is further plotted fig 8 for different membrane filtration systems the first step is to determine which parameters are suitable to be chosen as inputs for instance pressure temperature and solute concentration can be chosen as the inputs for ro process filtration time can be used as input variables in nf uf mf and mbr system some operating parameters and mixed liquor parameters such as hrt srt and mlss concentration are very important in the prediction of fouling behaviours in mbr based on the research of ai modeling in md processes operating parameters such as temperature permeate flow rate and solute concentration can be selected as input variables to predict membrane fouling behaviours with high accuracy the second step is to determine the prediction outcome that are directly or indirectly related to membrane fouling some parameters that directly related to membrane fouling such as tmp variation transient flux hydraulic resistance and salt rejection can be selected as outputs besides the interfacial energy between membrane and foulants interfacial interactions fouling layer thickness and fouling layer growth can also be predicted by training and selecting appropriate inputs kamali et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 mlp neural networks can be the primary choice which can adapt to different membrane filtration processes furthermore it is worth noting that the rbf neural network is more suitable for real time prediction or complex systems researchers and practitioners can select the appropriate ann types according to specific research targets when the specific research objectives are time series prediction fouling image recognition and complex filtration conditions other ai tools should be applied for instance rnn models are more advantageous when dealing with time series data or big database if researchers aim to simulate membrane fouling images based on image recognition cnn is an alternative when the simulation is conducted in a complex filtration system or at industrial scale the lstm model may be a suitable method viet et al 2021a with the development of algorithms the search algorithms such as ga and pso can make prediction of membrane fouling more accurate ga and pso algorithms can replace the bp training algorithm to optimize the weights of ann and further achieve faster convergence speed and higher accuracy ga optimized ann can solve smooth or non smooth optimization problems and achieve higher accuracy in predicting permeate flux various search algorithms can be combined to make the prediction of membrane fouling more accurate the combination of ga and pso algorithms is capable of improving the convergence speed of ga and reducing the probability of pso falling into local optimum which can effectively improve the prediction accuracy adaptive simulated annealing genetic algorithm is a combination of ga and sa and it has a powerful global searching capacity of ga as well as a strong local searching ability of sa as a result this hybrid search algorithms can provide more reliable predictions than single search algorithm especially when dealing with small sample data furthermore the combination of different algorithms can be used to further enhance the accuracy of the outputs anfis is a combination of ann and fl which uses the learning ability of ann and the computing power of fuzzy logic offering a more powerful tool for calculations the combination of ann and fl performs better in prediction of membrane fouling than ann alone the application of more advanced ann algorithms such as cnn and rnn are capable of capturing complex nonlinear relationship they use multiple interconnected networks for model training thereby considerably improving the training capacity and model accuracy although significant advances have been achieved in using ai based techniques for membrane fouling prediction there are still challenges to be addressed for the application of ai technology into membrane processes single ai tools such as ann has a poor reproducibility in predicting membrane fouling because the weight and bias between neurons are given randomly zhao et al 2020b besides the changes of operating parameters influent shock and membrane foulant interactions might lead to fluctuations in prediction accuracy ai models are also likely subject to overfitting if the input database is not large enough or the structure is too complex leading to the phenomenon that an intelligent model shows high accuracy on the training samples but fails to accurately predict for new samples model structure simplification input parameters optimization sensitivity analysis and data augmentation can reduce the possibility of overfitting zhong et al 2021 although deep learning can achieve high accuracy for prediction of membrane fouling the process requires large amounts of data for training and testing which might consume long time for processing schmidhuber 2015 in the current studies the selected inputs are relatively broad and has not been associated with specific compositions of foulants for example in some studies cod or mlss are selected as input parameters however the specific compositions in cod including proteins polysaccharides as well as other microbial products are ignored due to the black box nature of ai models application of ai models in predicting membrane fouling tendency cannot provide mechanistic insights into the reasons leading to the changing trend a combination of ai models and conventional mathematical models may help illustrate this issue furthermore the application of ai to predict membrane fouling or filtration processes is often limited by insufficient understanding of the membrane fouling mechanism more research efforts are needed to further address the challenges in application of ai techniques for predicting fouling in membrane based processes ga and pso are so far the most frequently investigated search algorithms for membrane fouling prediction other search algorithms such as ant colony algorithm artificial bee colony algorithm and colony optimization algorithm may be also feasible for fouling prediction the application of these search algorithms to prediction of membrane fouling deserves more research efforts hybrid ai models typically show better prediction accuracy because of its capability to overcome the shortcomings of a single intelligent model therefore more research efforts can be devoted to the combination of different ai approaches or introduction of different search algorithms to find the best solution for complex situations online monitoring systems have been well developed for fouling observation in real time it is a quite attractive topic to combine ai based technologies with real time online systems to make fast and timely predictions thereby facilitating the development of efficient and automatic membrane fouling control measures although substantial advances have been made in membrane fouling prediction and mechanisms exploration by ai technologies the study on the membrane fouling prediction in full scale plants is still limited membrane fouling is a complex dynamic process in full scale plants which calls for more efforts to promote applications of ai technique in real operations 5 conclusions this study systematically reviewed the application of ai techniques in membrane fouling prediction a series of ai algorithms ie ann search algorithm fl gp and svm have been successfully used to predict membrane fouling in a variety of membrane based processes during the past 20 years ann is the dominant algorithm in membrane fouling prediction for various membrane filtration systems the working principle of ann is flexible and the number of neurons in the input and output layers of ann can be adjusted according to the input and output variables due to its simplicity and accuracy mlp neural networks are widely used to simulate membrane fouling processes notably rbf neural networks have simple topology and faster computation speed which is more suitable for real time prediction cnn algorithm using fouling images as input variables can be used to predict the thickness porosity roughness and density of the fouling layer and to visualize the evolution of the fouling layer so far the application of ai based models to membrane fouling in fo and md are still scarce which are mainly based on ann although a single ai method has demonstrated its powerful prediction potential there are research gaps for the utilization of hybrid ai algorithms to further improve prediction capacity and accuracy of membrane fouling for membrane based processes declaration of competing interest the

16074,anaerobic granular sludge ags is a promising technology for organic wastewater treatment and energy recovery in this study three different kinds of fe and fe oxides nanoparticles fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi were tried to be incorporated into ags through direct loading or aided with biofilm disassembly agents of norspermidine and d tyrosine which was aimed to enhance methane production capacity of ags via increasing redox activity of extracellular polymer substance eps and interspecies electron transfer despite the loading methods incorporation of fe and fe oxides nanoparticles into ags increased methane production capacity remarkably with an enhancement of 36 49 85 17 20 37 204 95 and 189 71 243 32 respectively for the fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi loaded ags pretreatment of ags using biofilm disassembly agents helped to incorporate more fe and fe oxides into the inner structure of ags which further enhanced methane production capacity by 48 68 and 184 58 respectively for the fe3o4 and fe2o3 loaded ags loading fe and fe oxides into ags not only introduced exogenous conductive substances and fe iii fe ii redox couples into eps matrix of ags but also stimulated the production of redox active components of flavins and c cyts all these factors may contribute to the reduced resistance of eps enhanced interspecies electron transfer and methane production capacity of ags this study provides a novel strategy and facile method to accelerate interspecies electron transfer and enhance methane production for matured ags graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic granular sludge methane direct interspecies electron transfer redox active components fe and fe oxides 1 introduction anaerobic granular sludge ags can be regarded as a special type of biofilm which displays a granular shape and dense structure with microbes aggregated tightly and enclosed by extracellular polymer substance eps liu et al 2009 anaerobic granular sludge is generally developed in anaerobic reactors under specific operation conditions through a long term cultivation liu et al 2009 comparing to suspended anaerobic sludge ags demonstrates the advantages of high cell density high metabolic activity and good settling ability hulshoff pol et al 2004 therefore anaerobic biotechnology based on ags has a wide application in high strength organic wastewater treatment and energy recovery park et al 2018 siddique and wahid 2018 wainaina et al 2020 anaerobic granular sludge possesses a complex microbial community with different functional microbial populations located in different spaces subramanyam and mishra 2013 acetogenic bacteria and methanogens constitute the two major syntrophic populations in ags kallistova et al 2014 maspolim et al 2016 acetogenic bacteria which mainly distribute in the outer layers of ags could transform organic compounds to small molecule acids and h2 co2 and generate electrons methanogens mainly distributing in the inner parts of ags could biosynthesize methane using the products and electrons generated from the fermentative process kallistova et al 2014 therefore methane production ability of ags largely relies on interspecies electron transfer between acidogens and methanogens it is traditionally believed that the interspecies electron transfer between secondary fermenting bacteria and methanogenic archaea mainly depends on the mediators of h2 and formate shen et al 2016 recent studies have found that direct interspecies electron transfer diet may occur between methanogens and their syntrophic partners with the aid of pili c type cytochromes c cyts or conductive substances such as carbon nanotubes metal and metal oxides lovley and nevin 2011 summers et al 2010 diet may provide a more efficient manner for electron transfer from the reduced organic compounds to methanogens and improve methane production barua and dhar 2017 for example recent studies have revealed that supplementation of magnetite biochar and granular activated carbon could accelerate diet between bacteria and methanogens and enhanced methane production chen et al 2014 liu et al 2012 wang et al 2018 although supplementation of conductive materials into anaerobic digestion systems have been widely reported to promote direct electron transfer between suspended sludge bacteria casals et al 2014 chen et al 2014 kato et al 2012 lovley and nevin 2011 few studies focus on improving diet in ags it is hard to regulate interspecies electron transfer in matured ags through direct addition of conductive materials as those supplemented substances could hardly be incorporated into the inner structure of ags due to its dense structure the issue how to accelerate diet in ags has not been addressed and deserves further study extracellular polymer substance is a kind of high molecule biopolymer produced by microbes and mainly composed of proteins polysaccharides humic substances and dna sheng et al 2010 eps also contains abundant functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl amide phosphoryl and sulfhydryl groups et al participating in metal complexation and transformation sheng et al 2010 as a bridge linking different microbial species microbial cytomembrane cytoderm and terminal electron acceptors eps plays an important role in interspecies electron transfer siddharth et al 2021 the presence of redox moieties and redox actions in eps may influence extracellular electron transfer rate and direction in a microbial culture sheng et al 2010 therefore regulating redox active components in eps might be an effective strategy to mediate electron transfer in ags in this study three types of fe and fe oxides including zero valent iron zvi fe3o4 fe2o3 nanoparticles nps were selected as the target conductive substances as they have been reported to play a role in diet wang et al 2018 ye et al 2018a zhu et al 2020 we tried to incorporate them in to eps matrix of matured ags directly or with the aid of biofilm disassembly agents special attention was paid to 1 examine the different fe and fe oxides loading methods on their loading capacity and space distribution in ags 2 impacts of fe and fe oxides loading on the secretion of eps and redox active components flavins and c cyts and electron transfer property 3 evaluation of methane production capability of ags in response to fe and fe oxides incorporation and possible mechanisms this study will provide a novel strategy to immobilize fe and fe oxides into the inner structure of ags and contribute a better understanding of their functions in regulating methane production through mediating electron transfer pathway and activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials anaerobic granular sludge used in this study was obtained

measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 2 experiments of incorporating fe fe oxides into ags two methods were explored to incorporate fe fe oxides nps into ags one was direct incorporation in which the pristine ags was directly exposed to a certain dosage of fe fe oxides nps in aqueous medium in the other method ags was previously treated using biofilm disassembly agents to disrupt eps structure and create more pores beneficial for long range transfer of nanoparticles in the ags detailed procedures were as following firstly some ags samples were pretreated using a mixed biofilm disassembly agents of d tyrosine 3 mm and norspermidine 3 mm in phosphate buffer saline pbs solution for 12 h both pristine ags and pretreated ags were collected and rinsed gently with pbs solution for three times and then separately added to series of serum bottles each with a working volume of 200 ml each serum bottle was then fed with 200 ml culture medium containing 1500 mg l glucose as the

germany the ags loaded with fe fe oxides were freeze dried and characterized by x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro mpd holland to analyze fe species in ags to know the distribution of fe fe oxides nps in the fe ags some fe fe oxides nps labelled with amine reactive dye fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc were loaded to the ags according to the method of xia et al 2008 those fe ags samples were sectioned to slices fixed on chamber slides and visualized under a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm leica tcs sp8 germany 2 4 effects of fe fe oxides incorporation on digestion performance of ags the performance of the above prepared fe fe oxides loaded ags were assessed from the process of acidogenesis and methanogenesis through batch experiments the pristine ags or the fe ags prepared via the above different methods were added to series of serum bottles final biomass concentration of 7 g vss l which were then filled with basal culture medium containing 1200 mg l glucose all the bottles were flushed with high purity nitrogen tightly sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps connected to 50 ml syringes and then incubated in a shaker under the conditions of 150 rpm and 35 1 c during reaction water samples were withdrawn at certain time intervals filtrated using 0 22 μm filters and stored at 4 c for later analysis of volatile fatty acids vfas biogas was also collected and recorded through syringes and the methane content was measured after reaction each bottle was replaced with fresh medium and three consecutive batch experiments were conducted to assess the stability of fe fe oxides in ags effluent fe concentration during batch runs was also measured and the total fe loss with culture medium replacement was calculated all the experiments were repeated in

methane content was analyzed by gc with a thermal conductivity detector tcd under 160 c agilent 7890a usa the injector and initial oven temperature were 150 c and 100 c respectively helium was used as the carrier gas 2 5 eps extraction and structural characterization after exposure to fe fe oxides extracellular polymer substance is a main component of ags heating method was used to extract different eps fractions including soluble eps seps loose bound eps lb eps and tight bound eps tb eps according to the method reported previously zhang et al 2016 polysaccharide ps concentrations were measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 protein pn concentrations were determined using modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard frolund et al 1996 the eps samples were freeze dried overnight and ground into powder the species of fe in the eps of ags were characterized using xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha usa variation of functional groups of eps was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo nicolet is50 usa 2 6 electrochemical measurements of eps three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3 deem spectra of eps were acquired by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi japan the excitation ex and emission em wavelengths were 200 500 nm and 250 550 nm respectively in 5 nm increments with a scanning rate of 2400 nm min organic matters in eps could be divided into five regions according to the ex em wavelength peaks at ex em wavelengths of 200 250 nm 250 380 nm are related to simple aromatic proteins like tyrosine region i and ii peaks at ex em wavelengths of 200 380 nm 250 550 nm are related to fulvic acid like substances region iii peaks at ex em wavelengths of 250 250 nm 280 380 nm are related to soluble microbial by products region ⅳ peaks at ex em wavelengths of 250 380 nm 400 550 nm are related to humic acid like substances region ⅴ huang et al 2021 the concentration of c type cytochromes c cyts in eps was measured under an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan in a diffuse transmission mode electrochemical properties of eps were characterized through measuring cyclic voltammetry cv differential pulse voltammetry dpv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis under an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua shanghai china in three electrode systems a glassy carbon electrode and a platinum wire served as the working and counter electrode respectively and a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as the reference electrode he et al 2021 eps samples were loaded to working electrodes according to a modified method reported previously wang et al 2020 freezing dried eps samples 2 5 mg were mixed with isopropanol 0 5 ml and sonicated for 1 h to form a dispersion solution subsequently nafion aqueous solution 5 20 μl was added to the dispersion solution 100 μl finally the mixture was drop cast on a glassy carbon electrode to form eps films cv test was conducted under a potential range of 0 9 0 4 v vs sce at a scan rate of 0 005 v s dpv test

105hz and an amplitude of 5 mv 3 results and discussion 3 1 incorporation of fe and fe oxides nps into ags by different methods two different loading methods were investigated to incorporate fe fe oxides nps into ags one was conducted through exposing the pristine ags to fe fe oxides nps directly the other method was performed via pretreating the ags by biofilm disassembly agents of norspermidine and d tyrosine first and then exposing to fe fe oxides nps the results were presented in fig 1 a the ags with fe fe oxides loading prepared through direct exposing method here named fe3o4 ags d fe2o3 ags d zvi ags d attained a loading amount of 29 07 30 95 and 36 58 mg fe g vss respectively while the corresponding parts prepared through biofilm disassembly agents pretreatment here named fe3o4 ags p fe2o3 ags p zvi ags p attained an increased fe loading amount of 54 98 43 63 and 65 79 mg fe g vss respectively norspermidine and d tyrosine are able to mediate biofilm disassembly through non bactericidal mechanisms ramón peréz et al 2015 d tyrosine as a kind of d amino acids might cause the release of protein components from biofilm matrix kolodkin gal et al 2010 norspermidine can interact with exopolysaccharide and break up eps structure si et al 2014 our previous work has found that a combination of norspermidine and d amino acids could disassemble the eps of ags to a certain extent and increase porosity of ags si et al 2014 which might be beneficial for deep immobilization of fe fe oxides nps in ags effects of norspermidine to d tyrosine ratio on the fe loading capacity of ags were further investigated and the results were presented in fig 1b the fe3o4 ags p and zvi ags p attained a maximum fe loading at a ratio of norspermidine d tyrosine 1 1 while fe2o3 ags p achieved a maximum fe loading at the ratio of norspermidine d tyrosine 2 1 initial exposing dosage is another important factor influencing metal loading capacity of ags therefore the fe loading ability of ags was further assayed at initial fe fe oxides nps dosages of 100 500 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l after pretreatment using norspermidine and d tyrosine 1 1 fig 2 for all the three types of nps the fe loading amounts in ags increased with the increase of exposing dosage within a certain dosage range the ags attained a maximum loading of fe3o4 58 16 mg fe g vss fe2o3 40 04 mg fe g vss and zvi 110 27 mg fe g vss at the initial dosage of 3000 1000 and 2000 mg l respectively the ags demonstrated a much higher loading capacity of zvi than fe3o4 and fe2o3 nps 3 2 characterization of fe fe oxides nanoparticles in fe ags the ags with fe and fe oxides incorporation was characterized using xrd and the results were presented in fig 3 the diffraction peaks at 30 1 35 4 43 0 56 9 and 62 5 matched well with crystal planes 220 311 400 511 and 440 of the magnetite fe3o4 respectively jcpds no 86 1360 meanwhile the diffraction peaks at 33 1 35 6 and 54 0 were related to crystal planes 104 110 and 116 of the hematite fe2o3 respectively jcpds no 24 0072 the peaks at 44 6 and 64 7 matched well with crystal planes 110 and 200 of iron zvi respectively jcpds no 01 1262 the xrd patterns confirmed the successful incorporation of fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi nps into ags to know the space distribution of the loaded fe and fe oxides nps in the ags prepared using different methods some fe and fe oxides nps labelled with fluorescent agents were used in the loading experiments and the fe ags complex was sectioned and observed under clsm fig 4 it was found that the fe ags prepared via direct exposing experiments showed strong and clear fluorescence signals around the outer layers of ags for those fe ags prepared with the aid of biofilm disassembly agents much more fe fe oxides nps entered the inner parts of ags comparing to direct exposing experiments indicating this loading strategy promoted a long distance movement of fe fe oxides nps in ags pretreatment using the mixture of norspermidine and d tyrosine may change the dense structure of ags by increasing porosity due to breaking up eps structure si et al 2014 which may be the reason for the deep incorporation of fe fe oxides nps into ags 3 3 effects of fe fe oxides loading on vfas and methane production by ags effects of fe and fe oxides incorporation into ags on vfas production and methane production capacity were investigated vfas generation profiles during methane production were presented in fig 5 a it was found that within the first 12 h the fe and fe oxides loaded ags generated more vfas than the control ags suggesting their acid production capacity were improved after 24 h reaction the system with fe ags found less vfas content than the control ags possibly because the generated vfas were quickly consumed by methanogens for methane production accumulative methane production profiles were presented in fig 5b d despite the loading methods the ags loaded with fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi nps demonstrated an improved methane production ability comparing to the pristine ags with the final methane production increased by 36 49 85 17 20 37 204 95 and 189 71 243 32 respectively in addition loading fe3o4 and fe2o3 nps into ags through norspermidine and d tyrosine pretreatment further improved methane production comparing to direct loading method with final methane production increased by 48 68 and 184 58 respectively to know the long term methane production capability of those fe fe oxides loaded ags three consecutive batch experiments were conducted and the results were presented in fig 6 in the first cycle despite the different loading methods incorporation of fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi into ags enhanced methane production by 40 39 51 71 48 38 63 23 and 99 08 105 30 respectively comparing to the control ags although the enhancement in methane production declined in the third cycle it could still be observed with an increment of 4 49 33 81 24 92 23 98 and 10 08 49 87 for the fe3o4 fe2o3 zvi loaded ags respectively when the two different loading methods were compared in cycle 1 except zvi ags p it was found that fe3o4 ags p and fe2o3 ags p prepared under the pretreatment of biofilm disassembly agents showed higher methane production ability than fe3o4 ags d and fe2o3 ags d using direct loading method in cycle 3 except fe2o3 ags p fe3o4 ags p and zvi asg p showed higher methane production than fe3o4 ags d and zvi asg d the stability of fe and fe oxides in the fe ags was investigated through three consecutive batch experiments lasting 9 days and the accumulative fe loss versus the running time was determined and presented in fig 7 among the three types of nanoparticles zvi loaded ags was the most unstable with a total fe loss of 33 65 33 84 after three operation cycles possibly because zvi may turn to soluble fe2 fe3 through oxidation and be released from ags liu et al 2015 the fe3o4 and fe2o3 loaded ags were more stable than zvi loaded ags with a total fe loss of 10 23 13 95 and 2 79 4 98 respectively when the two different loading methods were compared it was found that fe3o4 ags p and fe2o3 ags p prepared under biofilm disassembly agents had less fe loss than the corresponding parts without pretreatment indicating that this pretreatment method is beneficial for stabilization of fe oxides in the ags 3 4 effects of fe and fe oxides loading in ags on eps production and composition eps plays an important role in maintaining the structure stability and integrity of ags flemming and wingender 2001 which mainly involves proteins polysaccharides and edna nouha et al 2015 the variation of eps content in ags as a response to fe fe oxides loading was investigated fig 8 except the sample fe2o3 ags p the other fe and fe oxides loaded ags generated more eps than the control ags with an increasement of 15 75 due to both increase in proteins and polysaccharides contents xps analysis was performed to investigate the element valence of fe in eps extracted from fe ags fig s1 high resolution spectrum of fe 2p showed the presence of fe 2p3 2 spectra which were divided into two peaks this indicated both fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ existed in eps ftir measurement was conducted to identify the organic groups in eps fig s2 ftir spectra of pristine eps and fe loaded eps showed no significant difference indicating that the addition of fe and fe oxides nanoparticles would not significantly change the organic groups of ags the eps composition was further characterized using of 3 deem spectra according to fig 9 a organic components in eps were divided into five categories region ⅰ and ⅱ represent simple aromatic proteins like tyrosine region ⅲ to ⅴ are related to fulvic acid like substances soluble microbial byproduct like substances and humic acid like substances respectively huang et al 2021 a fluorescence region integration method was used to quantify the fluorescence excitation emission matrix fig 9b it was interesting to find that when the fe and fe oxides loaded ags was pretreated with biofilm disassembly agents the fluorescence of region ⅰ and region ⅳ increased remarkably by 82 3 118 6 and 2 5 42 2 respectively suggesting deep immobilization of fe fe oxides in ags promoted the secretion of protein and soluble microbial products 3 5 effects of fe and fe oxides loading on electrochemical property of eps matrix effects of fe and fe oxides loading on electrochemical property of eps matrix from ags were characterized using multiple analytical methods including cv dpv and eis results showed that the tb eps extracted from fe ags samples demonstrated a more rectangular cv shape than the control eps sample fig 10 a c indicating incorporation of fe and fe oxides increased capacitances of eps furthermore incorporation of fe3o4 increased the capacitive property of tb eps more greatly than fe2o3 and zvi indicating the best capacitive behavior of fe3o4 liu et al 2006 meanwhile a peak potential of 0 25 v was observed for fe and fe oxides loaded eps samples which could be attributed to c cyts an important factor contributing to interspecies electron transfer ye et al 2018a eis experiment was conducted to investigate the conductivity of tb eps samples fig 10d f the eis data matched well with simulated equivalent circuit including a solution resistance rs a charge transfer resistance rct and a capacitance he et al 2021 compared with the control eps sample the eps extracted from fe ags found reduced amplitudes of the arc indicating that electron transfer resistance decreased and conductivity increased ye et al 2018b resistance distribution was determined according to the modeled results of equivalent circuit and results were summarized in table s1 eps samples from the fe ags showed lower charge transfer resistances 83 46 99 9 ω than that from control ags 103 7 ω indicating incorporation of fe fe oxides reduced electron transfer resistance in eps matrix differential pulse voltammetry dpv as a more sensitive method was used to probe redox moieties in eps matrix fig 11 two pairs of dpv peaks under potentials of 541 509 mv and 187 145 mv anodic cathodic were obviously observed which could be attributed to flavins and c cyts respectively jia et al 2021 moreover the fe ags samples showed higher reduction oxidation peak currents of flavins and c cyts comparing to the control ags indicating that those fe based conductive substances stimulated the secretion of flavins and c cyts in ags the eps samples from the fe ags aided by biofilm disassembly agents displayed higher dpv peak currents of flavins than corresponding parts prepared through direct loading uv vis spectrum was further conducted to quantify c cyts content in eps in response to fe and fe oxides loading fig 12 the spectra showed a strong adsorption peak at 419 nm which was related to c cyts ye et al 2018a the results showed the relative content of c cyts in eps increased by 3 58 for the fe ags comparing to the control ags furthermore pretreatment using biofilm disassembly agents further increased c cyts content in eps with an enhancement of 41 11 and 26 for the fe3o4 ags p fe2o3 ags p and zvi ags p respectively the stimulated secretion of c cyts is also an important factor conducive to electron transfer okamoto et al 2014 4 discussions microbial eps plays an important role in metal complexation and transformation due to the presence of functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl amide phosphoryl and sulfhydryl groups and thiols sheng et al 2010 on the one hand the eps on the surface of ags is an important factor for fe and fe oxides binding and association on the other hand the thick eps layers in ags may also retard the long distance movement of metal nanoparticles towards the inner parts of ags therefore two fe and fe oxides loading strategies were explored in this study i e direct exposing ags to metal nanoparticles or pretreatment of ags using biofilm disassembly agents before exposure our hypothesis is that disrupting the dense eps structure of ags with biofilm disassembly agents of norspermidine and d tyrosine could produce more inner pores or channels allowing deep immobilization of metal nanoparticles si et al 2014 clsm images revealed the space distribution of fe fe oxides nps in the ags and confirmed the above hypothesis as more fe and fe oxides were found to be loaded into the inner parts of ags with this pretreatment method comparing to the direct exposure method fig 4 despite the loading methods after incorporation those fe and fe oxides loaded ags samples had higher eps content than the control ags possibly because fe corrosion and fe2 fe3 hydrolysis could produce more h which could stimulate more eps excretion by bacteria ji et al 2010 as most components in eps are known to be poorly conductive borole et al 2011 das et al 2013 the electron transfer efficiency in the eps matrix greatly depends on the presence of conducting substances and redox active components such as humic substances flavins and c cyts aeschbacher et al 2010 marsili et al 2008 multiple electrochemical methods were used to investigate the electron transfer property and redox reactions in the eps matrix the cv and eis results indicated that incorporation of fe and fe oxides into ags increased electrical capacitance and conductivity of eps which could be attributed to the introduction of fe based conductive substances and stimulated secretion of endogenous redox active components including flavins and c cyts as good conductive substances fe and fe oxides incorporated into ags may combine with one another to form an electron conduit between syntrophic partners and promote diet kang et al 2021 viggi et al 2014 zhu et al 2020 it was reported that microbial self secreted flavins could serve as electron shuttles to mediate electron transfer and energy taxis toward insoluble electron acceptors edwards et al 2015 li et al 2012 flavins could exist in a free form or bind with c cyts as a c cyts bound cofactor to facilitate extracellular electron transfer okamoto et al 2013 cytochromes are iron containing proteins associated with membranes or diffusing into eps which can help to establish cell to cell connections and promote diet by transferring electrons from electron donating bacteria to various electron acceptors li et al 2021 liu et al 2020 it was reported about 80 of the overall electron flux in shewanella oneidensis mr 1 could be attributed to c cyts xu et al 2021 presence of fe iii may simulate c cyts production by bacteria he et al 2021 wan et al 2018 which may be a reason for the increased c cyts content in the eps of fe ags in addition fe3o4 ags p fe2o3 ags p and zvi ags p found more c cyts secretion than their corresponding parts prepared through direct loading possibly because more and deeper immobilization of fe fe oxides increased contacting chances of inner bacteria with fe species on the whole fe and fe oxides nps loading in ags enhanced methane production capacity the increased conductivity and capacitance of eps and cell to cell connection may promote interspecies electron transfer from acidogens to methanogens in ags which may be an important reason for the enhanced methane production the resulting fe iii fe ii released from fe and fe oxides of ags could promote acidification processes through the dissimilatory iron reduction process and provide more substrates for methanogens which may be another reason zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 through high throughput sequencing on an illumina miseq platform the microbial community of ags was analyzed and no great changes were observed after fe and fe oxides incorporation fig s3 suggesting variation in microbial community was not a main factor for the enhancement when the three different fe and fe oxides were compared zvi loaded ags showed a stronger methane production capability than fe3o4 and fe2o3 loaded ags besides the reason of increased extracellular electron transfer promoted hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis may be another reason for the enhanced methane production by zvi ags vyrides et al 2018 because zvi could be oxidized to fe2 under acidic conditions and generate h2 fe0 2h fe2 h2 liu et al 2015 in addition fe3o4 ags p and fe2o3 ags p prepared with biofilm disassembly agents demonstrated higher methane production capacity than fe3o4 ags d and fe2o3 ags d prepared through direct loading this is possibly because the pretreatment strategy helped to immobilize more fe oxides deeply in the ags which provide more fe iii fe ii electron shuttles and stimulated more flavins and c cyts secretion in the eps matrix however the beneficial effects were not observed for zvi ags p in the first cycle possibly because it was hidden by the improved effects of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis due to h2 production at the beginning of zvi oxidation but the benefit occurred in cycle 3 based on the above results the following mechanisms were proposed for the enhanced methane production by fe and fe oxides loaded ags fig 13 as good conductive materials introduction of fe and fe oxides into ags increased cell to cell connection reduced the resistance and enlarged electrical capacity of eps more endogenous electron mediators including flavins and c cyts were secreted due to fe and fe oxides incorporation the combination of exogenous conductive substances and endogenous redox active components could accelerate diet resulted from conductive materials and c cyts and extracellular electron transfer resulted from flavins which may contribute greatly to the increased methane production incorporation of fe and fe oxides into ags aided with biofilm disassembly agents helped to incorporate more fe and fe oxides deeply into the inner structure of ags by disrupting dense eps structure and create more channels which may establish a long distance electron transfer pathway from the acidogens in the outer layers to methanogens in the inner layers of ags and thus further promote methane production 5 conclusions to enhance methane production capacity of ags through promoting interspecies electron transfer three different kinds of fe and fe oxides nps fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi were tried to be incorporated into ags through different loading strategies regardless of the loading methods incorporation of fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi nps into ags enhanced methane production capacity by 36 49 85 17 20 37 204 95 and 189 71 243 32 respectively compared to the direct loading method pretreatment of ags using biofilm disassembly agents of norspermidine and d tyrosine helped to incorporate more fe and fe oxides nps deeply into the inner structure of ags which further enhanced the methane production capacity by 48 68 and 184 58 for fe3o4 ags p and fe2o3 ags p respectively possibly due to establishment of a long distance electron transfer pathway from the acidogens in the outer layers to methanogens in the inner layers of ags loading fe and fe oxides not only promoted eps secretion in ags but also stimulated the production of redox active components of flavins and c cyts in eps matrix all these factors

16074,anaerobic granular sludge ags is a promising technology for organic wastewater treatment and energy recovery in this study three different kinds of fe and fe oxides nanoparticles fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi were tried to be incorporated into ags through direct loading or aided with biofilm disassembly agents of norspermidine and d tyrosine which was aimed to enhance methane production capacity of ags via increasing redox activity of extracellular polymer substance eps and interspecies electron transfer despite the loading methods incorporation of fe and fe oxides nanoparticles into ags increased methane production capacity remarkably with an enhancement of 36 49 85 17 20 37 204 95 and 189 71 243 32 respectively for the fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi loaded ags pretreatment of ags using biofilm disassembly agents helped to incorporate more fe and fe oxides into the inner structure of ags which further enhanced methane production capacity by 48 68 and 184 58 respectively for the fe3o4 and fe2o3 loaded ags loading fe and fe oxides into ags not only introduced exogenous conductive substances and fe iii fe ii redox couples into eps matrix of ags but also stimulated the production of redox active components of flavins and c cyts all these factors may contribute to the reduced resistance of eps enhanced interspecies electron transfer and methane production capacity of ags this study provides a novel strategy and facile method to accelerate interspecies electron transfer and enhance methane production for matured ags graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic granular sludge methane direct interspecies electron transfer redox active components fe and fe oxides 1 introduction anaerobic granular sludge ags can be regarded as a special type of biofilm which displays a granular shape and dense structure with microbes aggregated tightly and enclosed by extracellular polymer substance eps liu et al 2009 anaerobic granular sludge is generally developed in anaerobic reactors under specific operation conditions through a long term cultivation liu et al 2009 comparing to suspended anaerobic sludge ags demonstrates the advantages of high cell density high metabolic activity and good settling ability hulshoff pol et al 2004 therefore anaerobic biotechnology based on ags has a wide application in high strength organic wastewater treatment and energy recovery park et al 2018 siddique and wahid 2018 wainaina et al 2020 anaerobic granular sludge possesses a complex microbial community with different functional microbial populations located in different spaces subramanyam and mishra 2013 acetogenic bacteria and methanogens constitute the two major syntrophic populations in ags kallistova et al 2014 maspolim et al 2016 acetogenic bacteria which mainly distribute in the outer layers of ags could transform organic compounds to small molecule acids and h2 co2 and generate electrons methanogens mainly distributing in the inner parts of ags could biosynthesize methane using the products and electrons generated from the fermentative process kallistova et al 2014 therefore methane production ability of ags largely relies on interspecies electron transfer between acidogens and methanogens it is traditionally believed that the interspecies electron transfer between secondary fermenting bacteria and methanogenic archaea mainly depends on the mediators of h2 and formate shen et al 2016 recent studies have found that direct interspecies electron transfer diet may occur between methanogens and their syntrophic partners with the aid of pili c type cytochromes c cyts or conductive substances such as carbon nanotubes metal and metal oxides lovley and nevin 2011 summers et al 2010 diet may provide a more efficient manner for electron transfer from the reduced organic compounds to methanogens and improve methane production barua and dhar 2017 for example recent studies have revealed that supplementation of magnetite biochar and granular activated carbon could accelerate diet between bacteria and methanogens and enhanced methane production chen et al 2014 liu et al 2012 wang et al 2018 although supplementation of conductive materials into anaerobic digestion systems have been widely reported to promote direct electron transfer between suspended sludge bacteria casals et al 2014 chen et al 2014 kato et al 2012 lovley and nevin 2011 few studies focus on improving diet in ags it is hard to regulate interspecies electron transfer in matured ags through direct addition of conductive materials as those supplemented substances could hardly be incorporated into the inner structure of ags due to its dense structure the issue how to accelerate diet in ags has not been addressed and deserves further study extracellular polymer substance is a kind of high molecule biopolymer produced by microbes and mainly composed of proteins polysaccharides humic substances and dna sheng et al 2010 eps also contains abundant functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl amide phosphoryl and sulfhydryl groups et al participating in metal complexation and transformation sheng et al 2010 as a bridge linking different microbial species microbial cytomembrane cytoderm and terminal electron acceptors eps plays an important role in interspecies electron transfer siddharth et al 2021 the presence of redox moieties and redox actions in eps may influence extracellular electron transfer rate and direction in a microbial culture sheng et al 2010 therefore regulating redox active components in eps might be an effective strategy to mediate electron transfer in ags in this study three types of fe and fe oxides including zero valent iron zvi fe3o4 fe2o3 nanoparticles nps were selected as the target conductive substances as they have been reported to play a role in diet wang et al 2018 ye et al 2018a zhu et al 2020 we tried to incorporate them in to eps matrix of matured ags directly or with the aid of biofilm disassembly agents special attention was paid to 1 examine the different fe and fe oxides loading methods on their loading capacity and space distribution in ags 2 impacts of fe and fe oxides loading on the secretion of eps and redox active components flavins and c cyts and electron transfer property 3 evaluation of methane production capability of ags in response to fe and fe oxides incorporation and possible mechanisms this study will provide a novel strategy to immobilize fe and fe oxides into the inner structure of ags and contribute a better understanding of their functions in regulating methane production through mediating electron transfer pathway and activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials anaerobic granular sludge used in this study was obtained

via the above different methods were added to series of serum bottles final biomass concentration of 7 g vss l which were then filled with basal culture medium containing 1200 mg l glucose all the bottles were flushed with high purity nitrogen tightly sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps connected to 50 ml syringes and then incubated in a shaker under the conditions of 150 rpm and 35 1 c during reaction water samples were withdrawn at certain time intervals filtrated using 0 22 μm filters and stored at 4 c for later analysis of volatile fatty acids vfas biogas was also collected and recorded through syringes and the methane content was measured after reaction each bottle was replaced with fresh medium and three consecutive batch experiments were conducted to assess the stability

the carrier gas 2 5 eps extraction and structural characterization after exposure to fe fe oxides extracellular polymer substance is a main component of ags heating method was used to extract different eps fractions including soluble eps seps loose bound eps lb eps and tight bound eps tb eps according to the method reported previously zhang et al 2016 polysaccharide ps concentrations were measured by the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 protein pn concentrations were determined using modified lowry method with bovine serum albumin bsa as the standard frolund et al 1996 the eps samples were freeze dried overnight and ground into powder the species of fe in the eps of ags were characterized using xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific k alpha usa variation of functional groups of eps was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo nicolet is50 usa 2 6 electrochemical measurements of eps three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3 deem spectra of eps were acquired by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi japan the excitation ex and emission em wavelengths were 200 500 nm and 250 550 nm respectively in 5 nm increments with a scanning rate of 2400 nm min organic matters in eps could be divided into five regions according to the ex em wavelength peaks at ex em wavelengths of 200 250 nm 250 380 nm are related to simple aromatic proteins like tyrosine region i and ii peaks at ex em wavelengths of 200 380 nm 250 550 nm are related to fulvic acid like substances region iii peaks at ex em wavelengths of 250 250 nm 280 380 nm are related to soluble microbial by products region ⅳ peaks at ex em wavelengths of 250 380 nm 400 550 nm are related to humic acid like substances region ⅴ huang et al 2021 the concentration of c type cytochromes c cyts in eps was measured under an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan in a diffuse transmission mode electrochemical properties of eps were characterized through measuring cyclic voltammetry cv differential pulse voltammetry dpv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis under an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua shanghai china in three electrode systems a glassy carbon electrode and a platinum wire served as the working and counter electrode respectively and a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as the reference electrode he et al 2021 eps samples were loaded to working electrodes according to a modified method reported previously wang et al 2020 freezing dried eps samples 2 5 mg were mixed with isopropanol 0 5 ml and sonicated for 1 h to form a dispersion solution subsequently nafion aqueous solution 5 20 μl was added to the dispersion solution 100 μl finally the mixture was drop cast on a glassy carbon electrode to form eps films cv test was conducted under a potential range of 0 9 0 4 v vs sce at a scan rate of 0 005 v s dpv test

105hz and an amplitude of 5 mv 3 results and discussion 3 1 incorporation of fe and fe oxides nps into ags by different methods two different loading methods were investigated to incorporate fe fe oxides nps into ags one was conducted through exposing the pristine ags to fe fe oxides nps directly the other method was performed via pretreating the ags by biofilm disassembly agents of norspermidine and d tyrosine first and then exposing to fe fe oxides nps the results were presented in fig 1 a the ags with fe fe oxides loading prepared through direct exposing method here named fe3o4 ags d fe2o3 ags d zvi ags d attained a loading amount of 29 07 30 95 and 36 58 mg fe g vss respectively while the corresponding parts prepared through biofilm disassembly agents pretreatment here named fe3o4 ags p fe2o3 ags p zvi ags p attained an increased fe loading amount of 54 98 43 63 and 65 79 mg fe g vss respectively norspermidine and d tyrosine are able to mediate biofilm disassembly through non bactericidal mechanisms ramón peréz et al 2015 d tyrosine as a kind of d amino acids might cause the release of protein components from biofilm matrix kolodkin gal et al 2010 norspermidine can interact with exopolysaccharide and break up eps structure si et al 2014 our previous work has found that a combination of norspermidine and d amino acids could disassemble the eps of ags to a certain extent and increase porosity of ags si et al 2014 which might be beneficial for deep immobilization of fe fe oxides nps in ags effects of norspermidine to d tyrosine ratio on the fe loading capacity of ags were further investigated and the results were presented in fig 1b the fe3o4 ags p and zvi ags p attained a maximum fe loading at a ratio of norspermidine d tyrosine 1 1 while fe2o3 ags p achieved a maximum fe loading at the ratio of norspermidine d tyrosine 2 1 initial exposing dosage is another important factor influencing metal loading capacity of ags therefore the fe loading ability of ags was further assayed at initial fe fe oxides nps dosages of 100 500 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l after pretreatment using norspermidine and d tyrosine 1 1 fig 2 for all the three types of nps the fe loading amounts in ags increased with the increase of exposing dosage within a certain dosage range the ags attained a maximum loading of fe3o4 58 16 mg fe g vss fe2o3 40 04 mg fe g vss and zvi 110 27 mg fe g vss at the initial dosage of 3000 1000 and 2000 mg l respectively the ags demonstrated a much higher loading capacity of zvi than fe3o4 and fe2o3 nps 3 2 characterization of fe fe oxides nanoparticles in fe ags the ags with fe and fe oxides incorporation was characterized using xrd and the results were presented in fig 3 the diffraction peaks at 30 1 35 4 43 0 56 9 and 62 5 matched well with crystal planes 220 311 400 511 and 440 of the magnetite fe3o4 respectively jcpds no 86 1360 meanwhile the diffraction peaks at 33 1 35 6 and 54 0 were related to crystal planes 104 110 and 116 of the hematite fe2o3 respectively jcpds no 24 0072 the peaks at 44 6 and 64 7 matched well with crystal planes 110 and 200 of iron zvi respectively jcpds no 01 1262 the xrd patterns confirmed the successful incorporation of fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi nps into ags to know the space distribution of the loaded fe and fe oxides nps in the ags prepared using different methods some fe and fe oxides nps labelled with fluorescent agents were used in the loading experiments and the fe ags complex was sectioned and observed under clsm fig 4 it was found that the fe ags prepared via direct exposing experiments showed strong and clear fluorescence signals around the outer layers of ags for those fe ags prepared with the aid of biofilm disassembly agents much more fe fe oxides nps entered the inner parts of ags comparing to direct exposing experiments indicating this loading strategy promoted a long distance movement of fe fe oxides nps in ags pretreatment using the mixture of norspermidine and d tyrosine may change the dense structure of ags by increasing porosity due to breaking up eps structure si et al 2014 which may be the reason for the deep incorporation of fe fe oxides nps into ags 3 3 effects of fe fe oxides loading on vfas and methane production by ags effects of fe and fe oxides incorporation into ags on vfas production and methane production capacity were investigated vfas generation profiles during methane production were presented in fig 5 a it was found that within the first 12 h the fe and fe oxides loaded ags generated more vfas than the control ags suggesting their acid production capacity were improved after 24 h reaction the system with fe ags found less vfas content than the control ags possibly because the generated vfas were quickly consumed by methanogens for methane production accumulative methane production profiles were presented in fig 5b d despite the loading methods the ags loaded with fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi nps demonstrated an improved methane production ability comparing to the pristine ags with the final methane production increased by 36 49 85 17 20 37 204 95 and 189 71 243 32 respectively in addition loading fe3o4 and fe2o3 nps into ags through norspermidine and d tyrosine pretreatment further improved methane production comparing to direct loading method with final methane production increased by 48 68 and 184 58 respectively to know the long term methane production capability of those fe fe oxides loaded ags three consecutive batch experiments were conducted and the results were presented in fig 6 in the first cycle despite the different loading methods incorporation of fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi into ags enhanced methane production by 40 39 51 71 48 38 63 23 and 99 08 105 30 respectively comparing to the control ags although the enhancement in methane production declined in the third cycle it could still be observed with an increment of 4 49 33 81 24 92 23 98 and 10 08 49 87 for the fe3o4 fe2o3 zvi loaded ags respectively when the two different loading methods were compared in cycle 1 except zvi ags p it was found that fe3o4 ags p and fe2o3 ags p prepared under the pretreatment of biofilm disassembly agents showed higher methane production ability than fe3o4 ags d and fe2o3 ags d using direct loading method in cycle 3 except fe2o3 ags p fe3o4 ags p and zvi asg p showed higher methane production than fe3o4 ags d and zvi asg d the stability of fe and fe oxides in the fe ags was investigated through three consecutive batch experiments lasting 9 days and the accumulative fe loss versus the running time was determined and presented in fig 7 among the three types of nanoparticles zvi loaded ags was the most unstable with a total fe loss of 33 65 33 84 after three operation cycles possibly because zvi may turn to soluble fe2 fe3 through oxidation and be released from ags liu et al 2015 the fe3o4 and fe2o3 loaded ags were more stable than zvi loaded ags with a total fe loss of 10 23 13 95 and 2 79 4 98 respectively when the two different loading methods were compared it was found that fe3o4 ags p and fe2o3 ags p prepared under biofilm disassembly agents had less fe loss than the corresponding parts without pretreatment indicating that this pretreatment method is beneficial for stabilization of fe oxides in the ags 3 4 effects of fe and fe oxides loading in ags on eps production and composition eps plays an important role in maintaining the structure stability and integrity of ags flemming and wingender 2001 which mainly involves proteins polysaccharides and edna nouha et al 2015 the variation of eps content in ags as a response to fe fe oxides loading was investigated fig 8 except the sample fe2o3 ags p the other fe and fe oxides loaded ags generated more eps than the control ags with an increasement of 15 75 due to both increase in proteins and polysaccharides contents xps analysis was performed to investigate the element valence of fe in eps extracted from fe ags fig s1 high resolution spectrum of fe 2p showed the presence of fe 2p3 2 spectra which were divided into two peaks this indicated both fe ⅱ and fe ⅲ existed in eps ftir measurement was conducted to identify the organic groups in eps fig s2 ftir spectra of pristine eps and fe loaded eps showed no significant difference indicating that the addition of fe and fe oxides nanoparticles would not significantly change the organic groups of ags the eps composition was further characterized using of 3 deem spectra according to fig 9 a organic components in eps were divided into five categories region ⅰ and ⅱ represent simple aromatic proteins like tyrosine region ⅲ to ⅴ are related to fulvic acid like substances soluble microbial byproduct like substances and humic acid like substances respectively huang et al 2021 a fluorescence region integration method was used to quantify the fluorescence excitation emission matrix fig 9b it was interesting to find that when the fe and fe oxides loaded ags was pretreated with biofilm disassembly agents the fluorescence of region ⅰ and region ⅳ increased remarkably by 82 3 118 6 and 2 5 42 2 respectively suggesting deep immobilization of fe fe oxides in ags promoted the secretion of protein and soluble microbial products 3 5 effects of fe and fe oxides loading on electrochemical property of eps matrix effects of fe and fe oxides loading on electrochemical property of eps matrix from ags were characterized using multiple analytical methods including cv dpv and eis results showed that the tb eps extracted from fe ags samples demonstrated a more rectangular cv shape than the control eps sample fig 10 a c indicating incorporation of fe and fe oxides increased capacitances of eps furthermore incorporation of fe3o4 increased the capacitive property of tb eps more greatly than fe2o3 and zvi indicating the best capacitive behavior of fe3o4 liu et al 2006 meanwhile a peak potential of 0 25 v was observed for fe and fe oxides loaded eps samples which could be attributed to c cyts an important factor contributing to interspecies electron transfer ye et al 2018a eis experiment was conducted to investigate the conductivity of tb eps samples fig 10d f the eis data matched well with simulated equivalent circuit including a solution resistance rs a charge transfer resistance rct and a capacitance he et al 2021 compared with the control eps sample the eps extracted from fe ags found reduced amplitudes of the arc indicating that electron transfer resistance decreased and conductivity increased ye et al 2018b resistance distribution was determined according to the modeled results of equivalent circuit and results were summarized in table s1 eps samples from the fe ags showed lower charge transfer resistances 83 46 99 9 ω than that from control ags 103 7 ω indicating incorporation of fe fe oxides reduced electron transfer resistance in eps matrix differential pulse voltammetry dpv as a more sensitive method was used to probe redox moieties in eps matrix fig 11 two pairs of dpv peaks under potentials of 541 509 mv and 187 145 mv anodic cathodic were obviously observed which could be attributed to flavins and c cyts respectively jia et al 2021 moreover the fe ags samples showed higher reduction oxidation peak currents of flavins and c cyts comparing to the control ags indicating that those fe based conductive substances stimulated the secretion of flavins and c cyts in ags the eps samples from the fe ags aided by biofilm disassembly agents displayed higher dpv peak currents of flavins than corresponding parts prepared through direct loading uv vis spectrum was further conducted to quantify c cyts content in eps in response to fe and fe oxides loading fig 12 the spectra showed a strong adsorption peak at 419 nm which was related to c cyts ye et al 2018a the results showed the relative content of c cyts in eps increased by 3 58 for the fe ags comparing to the control ags furthermore pretreatment using biofilm disassembly agents further increased c cyts content in eps with an enhancement of 41 11 and 26 for the fe3o4 ags p fe2o3 ags p and zvi ags p respectively the stimulated secretion of c cyts is also an important factor conducive to electron transfer okamoto et al 2014 4 discussions microbial eps plays an important role in metal complexation and transformation due to the presence of functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl amide phosphoryl and sulfhydryl groups and thiols sheng et al 2010 on the one hand the eps on the surface of ags is an important factor for fe and fe oxides binding and association on the other hand the thick eps layers in ags may also retard the long distance movement of metal nanoparticles towards the inner parts of ags therefore two fe and fe oxides loading strategies were explored in this study i e direct exposing ags to metal nanoparticles or pretreatment of ags using biofilm disassembly agents before exposure our hypothesis is that disrupting the dense eps structure of ags with biofilm disassembly agents of norspermidine and d tyrosine could produce more inner pores or channels allowing deep immobilization of metal nanoparticles si et al 2014 clsm images revealed the space distribution of fe fe oxides nps in the ags and confirmed the above hypothesis as more fe and fe oxides were found to be loaded into the inner parts of ags with this pretreatment method comparing to the direct exposure method fig 4 despite the loading methods after incorporation those fe and fe oxides loaded ags samples had higher eps content than the control ags possibly because fe corrosion and fe2 fe3 hydrolysis could produce more h which could stimulate more eps excretion by bacteria ji et al 2010 as most components in eps are known to be poorly conductive borole et al 2011 das et al 2013 the electron transfer efficiency in the eps matrix greatly depends on the presence of conducting substances and redox active components such as humic substances flavins and c cyts aeschbacher et al 2010 marsili et al 2008 multiple electrochemical methods were used to investigate the electron transfer property and redox reactions in the eps matrix the cv and eis results indicated that incorporation of fe and fe oxides into ags increased electrical capacitance and conductivity of eps which could be attributed to the introduction of fe based conductive substances and stimulated secretion of endogenous redox active components including flavins and c cyts as good conductive substances fe and fe oxides incorporated into ags may combine with one another to form an electron conduit between syntrophic partners and promote diet kang et al 2021 viggi et al 2014 zhu et al 2020 it was reported that microbial self secreted flavins could serve as electron shuttles to mediate electron transfer and energy taxis toward insoluble electron acceptors edwards et al 2015 li et al 2012 flavins could exist in a free form or bind with c cyts as a c cyts bound cofactor to facilitate extracellular electron transfer okamoto et al 2013 cytochromes are iron containing proteins associated with membranes or diffusing into eps which can help to establish cell to cell connections and promote diet by transferring electrons from electron donating bacteria to various electron acceptors li et al 2021 liu et al 2020 it was reported about 80 of the overall electron flux in shewanella oneidensis mr 1 could be attributed to c cyts xu et al 2021 presence of fe iii may simulate c cyts production by bacteria he et al 2021 wan et al 2018 which may be a reason for the increased c cyts content in the eps of fe ags in addition fe3o4 ags p fe2o3 ags p and zvi ags p found more c cyts secretion than their corresponding parts prepared through direct loading possibly because more and deeper immobilization of fe fe oxides increased contacting chances of inner bacteria with fe species on the whole fe and fe oxides nps loading in ags enhanced methane production capacity the increased conductivity and capacitance of eps and cell to cell connection may promote interspecies electron transfer from acidogens to methanogens in ags which may be an important reason for the enhanced methane production the resulting fe iii fe ii released from fe and fe oxides of ags could promote acidification processes through the dissimilatory iron reduction process and provide more substrates for methanogens which may be another reason zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 through high throughput sequencing on an illumina miseq platform the microbial community of ags was analyzed and no great changes were observed after fe and fe oxides incorporation fig s3 suggesting variation in microbial community was not a main factor for the enhancement when the three different fe and fe oxides were compared zvi loaded ags showed a stronger methane production capability than fe3o4 and fe2o3 loaded ags besides the reason of increased extracellular electron transfer promoted hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis may be another reason for the enhanced methane production by zvi ags vyrides et al 2018 because zvi could be oxidized to fe2 under acidic conditions and generate h2 fe0 2h fe2 h2 liu et al 2015 in addition fe3o4 ags p and fe2o3 ags p prepared with biofilm disassembly agents demonstrated higher methane production capacity than fe3o4 ags d and fe2o3 ags d prepared through direct loading this is possibly because the pretreatment strategy helped to immobilize more fe oxides deeply in the ags which provide more fe iii fe ii electron shuttles and stimulated more flavins and c cyts secretion in the eps matrix however the beneficial effects were not observed for zvi ags p in the first cycle possibly because it was hidden by the improved effects of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis due to h2 production at the beginning of zvi oxidation but the benefit occurred in cycle 3 based on the above results the following mechanisms were proposed for the enhanced methane production by fe and fe oxides loaded ags fig 13 as good conductive materials introduction of fe and fe oxides into ags increased cell to cell connection reduced the resistance and enlarged electrical capacity of eps more endogenous electron mediators including flavins and c cyts were secreted due to fe and fe oxides incorporation the combination of exogenous conductive substances and endogenous redox active components could accelerate diet resulted from conductive materials and c cyts and extracellular electron transfer resulted from flavins which may contribute greatly to the increased methane production incorporation of fe and fe oxides into ags aided with biofilm disassembly agents helped to incorporate more fe and fe oxides deeply into the inner structure of ags by disrupting dense eps structure and create more channels which may establish a long distance electron transfer pathway from the acidogens in the outer layers to methanogens in the inner layers of ags and thus further promote methane production 5 conclusions to enhance methane production capacity of ags through promoting interspecies electron transfer three different kinds of fe and fe oxides nps fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi were tried to be incorporated into ags through different loading strategies regardless of the loading methods incorporation of fe3o4 fe2o3 and zvi nps into ags enhanced methane production capacity by 36 49 85 17 20 37 204 95 and 189 71 243 32 respectively compared to the direct loading method pretreatment of ags using biofilm disassembly agents of norspermidine and d tyrosine helped to incorporate more fe and fe oxides nps deeply into the inner structure of ags which further enhanced the methane production capacity by 48 68 and 184 58 for fe3o4 ags p and fe2o3 ags p respectively possibly due to establishment of a long distance electron transfer pathway from the acidogens in the outer layers to methanogens in the inner layers of ags loading fe and fe oxides not only promoted eps secretion in ags but also stimulated the production of redox active components of flavins and c cyts in eps matrix all these factors may contribute to the reduced resistance of eps enhanced interspecies electron transfer and methane production capacity of ags declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
