25115,species interactions potentially affect dispersal evolution however previous studies about dispersal focused mostly on one or two species systems and dispersal evolution in metacommunities composed of more than two interacting species is left to study here we use a spatially explicit individual based model to investigate the concurrent evolution of dispersal probabilities in metacommunities of tri trophic interaction systems with one host parasitoid and hyperparasitoid species we vary search efficiency interaction intensity of parasitoid on host and search efficiency of hyperparasitoid on parasitoid under different dispersal mortalities our results indicate that the tri trophic system can persist in limited range of search efficiency of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid higher search efficiency of hyperparasitoid generally resulted in the evolution of higher dispersal probabilities of all species while higher search efficiency of parasitoid increases only host and parasitoid dispersal probabilities but decreases hyperparasitoid dispersal probabilities dispersal mortality has a negative effect on emergent dispersal probabilities for all three species moreover an increase in dispersal mortality desynchronizes population dynamics and widens the range of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid search efficiencies under which the tri trophic system can persist keywords dispersal evolution tri trophic interaction theory individual based model host parasitoid interaction 1 introduction dispersal is defined as the movement of an individual from site of birth to site of reproduction natal dispersal or its movement between successive sites of reproduction breeding dispersal matthysen 2012 it is an important process in biological systems because it has consequences at different biological levels on the individual level dispersal plays roles in determining fitness for example by avoiding crowding kin competition and other unfavorable conditions reviewed in ronce 2007 on the population level dispersal affects metapopulation dynamics and leads to gene flow within and between populations hanski and gilpin 1997 hanski 1999 benton and bowler 2012 and expansion into new ranges thomas et al 2001 walther et al 2002 parmesan 2006 berg et al 2010 reviewed in le galliared et al 2012 on the community level dispersal can determine community dynamics cadotte and fukami 2005 cadotte 2006 and affect species interactions such as the match or mismatch between interacting species schweiger et al 2008 dispersal evolution can be driven by many ecological demographic and evolutionary factors population density travis et al 1999 poethke and hovestadt 2002 hovestadt et al 2010 kin competition hamilton and may 1977 comins et al 1980 gandon and rousset 1999 bach et al 2006 poethke et al 2007 inbreeding avoidance gandon 1999 perrin and goudet 2001 population dynamics holt and mcpeek 1996 spatio temporal habitat variability comins et al 1980 travis and dytham 1999 travis 2001 poethke et al 2003 are known to have positive effects on dispersal in contrast energy demands and dispersal risks can select against dispersal of organisms reviewed in bonte et al 2011 both theoretical and empirical studies showed that antagonistic interactions can influence dispersal of organisms as well weisser et al 1999 french and travis 2001 mondor et al 2005 green 2009 poethke et al 2010 chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a b 2015 amarasekare 2016 because antagonistic interactions can induce strong oscillations in populations of interacting partners resulting in spatio temporal variability in ﬁtness expectations between patches green 2009 chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a community diversity and the type of interspecific interactions may also influence dispersal evolution for example chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a compared dispersal evolution in metacommunities with different species compositions and found that the dispersal trait evolves differently in a two species metacommunities one host species and one parasite species than a four species metacommunities two host species and two specialist parasite species where only host species compete in the four species systems lower dispersal probabilities evolve than in the two species system since frequency dependent interaction between hosts modulate dispersal benefits in the four species systems amarasekare 2016 studied dispersal evolution in a tri trophic community where a species interacts with its resource and its predator in her model only the dispersal of an intermediate consumer could evolve in response to its interactions with its resource and its predator she found that spatial and temporal variation in the consumer s fitness emerging in tri trophic interaction could affect dispersal evolution however knowledge about dispersal evolution in multi species communities and relationship between dispersal evolution and community structure is still lacking here we investigate dispersal evolution in a tri trophic metacommunity consisting of a host a parasitoid and a hyperparasitoid species by utilizing a spatially explicit individual based model in this system the host species is attacked and killed by a primary parasitoid species called parasitoid this parasitoid is in turn utilized as host by a secondary parasitoid called hyperparasitoid such tri trophic communities are found in various taxa of phytophagous and predacious insects reviewed in sullivan and völkl 1999 we further assume that dispersal evolves in all three species particularly this study focusses on the effects of search efficiency intensity of interaction of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid on evolving dispersal probabilities it was already demonstrated that the intensity of interaction can profoundly affect dispersal evolution in a simpler two species host parasite system chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a b in addition we investigate the effects of search efficiency of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid on the persistence of the metacommunity persistence means simply that the populations of hosts parasitoids and hyperparasitoids do not go extinct briggs and hoopes 2004 moreover we tested the generality of the results by varying dispersal mortalities which has been shown to play a prominent role in dispersal evolution gandon and rousset 1999 bach et al 2006 2 models and simulations we developed and utilized a spatially explicit individual based and stochastic metacommunity model to simulate a system with interacting host parasitoid hyperparasitoid species and to investigate the concurrent evolution of dispersal in this tri trophic system in a spatially explicit landscape by using program lazarus 1 2 6 the landscape was modeled as a two dimensional grid of identical habitat patches this grid was wrapped into a torus in both dimensions to avoid edge effects each habitat patch could support a community of species that could consist of one host one parasitoid and one hyperparasitoid population in this model we used the basic model framework for insect hosts and their parasitoids hassell 2000 such a system is also observed in nature such as interaction between caterpillars of pieris butterflies their primary parasitoid cotesia glomerata or c rubecula and their hyperparasitoids acrolyta nens lysibia nana pteromalus semotus mesochorus gemellus and baryscapus galactopus poelman et al 2012 we assumed that hosts parasitoids and hyperparasitoids have a synchronized and simple annual life cycle with discrete generations we assumed that all three species are haploid organisms reproducing asexually to avoid complications associated with sexual reproduction such as inbreeding depression recombination or an allee effect see kubisch et al 2011 the parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were specialized on attacking the larval stage of their hosts we assume that the larva stage is the target of attack by the antagonistic species the system is thus more stable and persist in wider parameter range than previous two species systems where adults are the targets for parasitoids chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a b in comparison the selective pressure of the antagonistic species attacking offspring is weaker than those attacking adults 2 1 the life cycle of host parasitoid and hyperparasitoid species the life cycle of the three species proceeded in the following sequence 1 host reproduction all hosts produced larvae with density dependent regulation and all adult hosts died directly after reproduction process 2 parasitoid reproduction following host reproduction host larvae could be attacked and killed by parasitoids to produce parasitoid larvae all adult parasitoids died thereafter 3 hyperparasitoid reproduction parasitoid larvae could be attacked and killed by adult hyperparasitoids to produce hyperparasitoid larvae all adult hyperparasitoids died after reproduction 4 maturation and dispersal surviving larvae of all species matured into adults matured individuals might disperse taking a defined dispersal risk dispersal mortality 5 dispersing and non dispersing individuals reproduced in the sequence as mentioned above and the life cycle of the three species is repeated fig 1 2 1 1 host reproduction local population of host species underlay density dependent regulation all host individuals in patch m at time t produced a number of larvae drawn from a poisson distribution with mean λ m t as calculated by the equation adapted from the beverton holt model beverton and holt 1981 1 λ m t λ 0 1 λ 0 1 k h m t where λ0 denotes the net reproductive rate k is the carrying capacity of a patch for the host species and h m t is the number of adult hosts in patch m at time t the total number of larvae produced in patch m at time t l h m t was then exposed to possible attack by parasitoids 2 1 2 parasitoid reproduction adult parasitoids attacked only host larvae before they became mature for any successful attack on hosts adult parasitoid individuals produced offspring with poisson distributed number of a mean value of u the risk of a host larva in patch m at time t to become infected by parasitoids p l h m t was calculated according to the nicholson bailey equation nicholson and bailey 1935 with a modified holling s type ii functional response holling 1959a 1959b 2 p l h m t 1 e x p a p m t 1 a l h m t where p m t is the number of adult parasitoids in patch m at time t a denotes the per capita efficiency of parasitoids searching for host larvae search efficiency of parasitoid the larger a the more efficiently parasitoids are in finding host larvae in all cases we assumed that the parasitoid s handling time was equal to one and was thus not included in the equation we regulated the interaction intensity between hosts and parasitoids only by changing the per capita search efficiency of parasitoid a whether a host larva was attacked was decided by drawing a random number from the interval 0 1 if the number was smaller than p l h m t the host larva was attacked by a randomly selected adult parasitoid from the parasitoid pool otherwise it was uninfected an attacked host larva was killed directly after a parasitoid encounter and was not attacked by another parasitoid however a parasitoid adult could attack more than one host larva sampling with replacement note that the expected number of parasitoid larvae generated before being attacked by hyperparasitoids l p m t was 3 l p m t u l h m t 1 e x p a p m t 1 a l h m t whereas the expected number of host larvae avoiding infection l h m t and later developing into adults was 4 l h m t l h m t e x p a p m t 1 a l h m t 2 1 3 hyperparasitoid reproduction adult hyperparasitoids attacked parasitoid larvae in the same way as adult parasitoids attack host larvae parasitoid larvae were attacked and killed by an adult hyperparasitoid before maturation and dispersal successful hyperparasitoid individuals produced a poisson distributed number of offspring with a mean value of v for each successful attack a parasitoid larva could be a host for only one hyperparasitoid adult but a hyperparasitoid adult could attack more than one parasitoid larva however the infection of parasitoids was independent from each other parasitoids emerging from the same host must not be attacked by a same hyperparasitoid the attack risk of a parasitoid larva in patch m at time t by a hyperparasitoid p l p m t was again calculated according to the nicholson bailey equation nicholson and bailey 1935 with a modified holling s type ii functional response holling 1959a 1959b 5 p l p m t 1 e x p b q m t 1 b l p m t where q m t denotes the number of adult hyperparasitoids in patch m at time t respectively and b is the per capita search efficiency of hyperparasitoid on parasitoids the larger b the more efficiently the hyperparasitoid can find parasitoid larvae the expected number of hyperparasitoid larvae produced in patch m at time step t l q m t was thus 6 l q m t v l p m t 1 e x p b q m t 1 b l p m t and the expected number of surviving parasitoid larvae l p m t was 7 l p m t l p m t e x p b q m t 1 b l p m t 2 1 4 maturation and dispersal surviving host parasitoid and all hyperparasitoid larvae turned into adults of the next generation members of all three species might before the onset of the next reproductive cycle perform dispersal according to the same rule an individual i decided either to disperse or remain in its natal patch depending on the genetically determined dispersal probability di a trait inherited from its parent see below and constrained to 0 di 1 whether an individual dispersed was decided by drawing a random number from the interval 0 1 if the number was smaller than di the individual dispersed otherwise it remained in its natal patch if an individual dispersed it moved randomly to one of the eight neighboring habitat patches moore neighborhood gray 2003 the parental dispersal trait was usually copied inherited to the offspring but the trait could mutate occasionally by drawing a random value from the uniform distribution 0 1 with mutation rate μ for all species μ is fixed at 0 001 we assumed that during dispersal an individual might die with a certain dispersal mortality c the dispersal mortality of all species was equal in all scenarios this should reflect a dispersal cost on any dispersing individual after all survivors had reached target patches they reproduced according to the description above we use terms dh dp and dq for host parasitoid hyperparasitoid dispersal probability trait respectively 2 2 scenarios and parameter values with the model we studied the effect of the intensity of species interaction modulated by search efficiency of parasitoid a and search efficiency of hyperparasitoid b on the evolution of dispersal probability both search efficiency of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were varied in a certain range see table 1 for more details the consistency of the results was tested under different dispersal mortality c 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 at these dispersal mortality values we observed significant differences in persistence range and evolving dispersal probabilities of the system as the system changed from almost global homogeneity at low dispersal mortality to more global desynchronization at higher dispersal mortality we assumed that a patch could support a large population of the host species k 1000 to avoid strong effects of demographic stochasticity and kin competition on dispersal evolution these effects become particularly important in small population poethke et al 2007 we chose a low value of the mean number of offspring for parasitoids and hyperparasitoids u v 2 because with too large u and v the tri trophic system typically collapsed extinction of at least one species a summary of all model parameters and their values is provided in table 1 2 3 initial conditions and analyses at the beginning of every simulation each patch was initialized with k host individuals k 1000 just 10 parasitoid individuals per patch and without hyperparasitoids to avoid the collapse of the host and or parasitoid metapopulation at the beginning of simulations in a non equilibrium phase ten hyperparasitoid individuals per patch were introduced into the system after iterating 100 generations of hosts and parasitoids the initial value for the dispersal probability of every individual of all three species was picked randomly from a uniform distribution 0 1 for the simulations we created a lattice landscape of dimension 32 32 1024 patches a single simulation ran over 2000 generations at this point ecological and evolutionary dynamics stabilized in all simulation without further systematic trends in population size or trait evolution supplementary fig a1 and a2 this does not exclude the establishment of stable oscillations where systems never reach a stable equilibrium e g in case of high search efficiency of hyperparasitoid where the dispersal probabilities of parasitoids and hyperparasitoids fluctuated over time for each parameter set we carried out twenty simulation replicates as a reference of evolving dispersal probabilities we also ran simulations for only two species system host and parasitoid with the same parameter combinations we explored the parameter ranges where the complete system could persist by counting the number of simulations out of 20 replicates where neither host parasitoid nor hyperparasitoid species went globally extinct within 2000 generations with some parameter combinations local and global populations of hosts parasitoids and hyperparasitoids fluctuated strongly over time resulting in the strong drift effects in small metapopulation supplementary fig a2 the global population of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid species could vary from a few hundred individuals to more than a hundred thousand individuals over time in some case supplementary fig a1 for this reason we calculated the mean dispersal probabilities of hosts parasitoids and hyperparasitoids over the last 100 generations of each simulation run for analysis for data presentation we averaged the mean of dispersal probabilities for each parameter combination from all replicates where all three species persisted for presentation of the magnitude of population fluctuation we calculated the coefficient of variation cv of the global population size for each species over the last 100 generations the correlation between the coefficient of variation cv of the global population size and averaged dispersal probabilities was presented by spearman s rank correlation rho because the dispersal probabilities of the three species was not normally distributed 3 results 3 1 persistence of the system the tri trophic system persists only in a limited range of the combinations of search efficiencies of parasitoid a and hyperparasitoid b tested fig 2 at the lowest dispersal mortality c 0 05 the persistence of hyperparasitoid species occurs only between a 0 003 and a 0 05 and between b 0 003 and b 0 03 fig 2a at some a and b values however the hyperparasitoid metapopulation persists in some but not all replicates at high a the host species and consequently the two other species too goes extinct in some replicates an increase in dispersal mortality widens the parameter range under which the complete tri trophic system can persist the persistence of the tri trophic system ranges from a 0 003 to 0 5 and from b 0 003 to 0 07 at c 0 15 and from b 0 003 to 0 1 at c 0 25 fig 2b and c 3 2 evolution of dispersal the distribution of dispersal probabilities within the global population is unimodal for the three species in all scenarios supplementary figure a3 shows examples of the distribution from some scenarios 3 2 1 the role of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid search efficiency an increase in search efficiency of hyperparasitoid leads to the evolution of higher dispersal probabilities in all three species whereas an increase in search efficiency of parasitoid results in an increase in dispersal probabilities of hosts and parasitoids but in a slight reduction of hyperparasitoid dispersal probabilities fig 3 shows examples for some b values the results for the complete combination of a and b is in fig 4 an increase in search efficiency of parasitoid promotes greater population size of hyperparasitoids because more parasitoids become available fig 5 a c b d e g f h spatial and temporal variability of hyperparasitoid populations is reduced and lower dispersal probabilities of hyperparasitoids are selected for the dispersal probabilities of host show strong correlation with those of parasitoid and the dispersal probabilities of parasitoids correlate with the hyperparasitoid dispersal probabilities fig 6 at all dispersal mortalities parasitoids evolve higher dispersal probabilities than hosts fig 6a while hyperparasitoid dispersal probabilities are higher than those of parasitoids when a and b are low but at high a and b the parasitoid species tends to disperse more than the hyperparasitoid species fig 6b search efficiency of hyperparasitoids is a key factor determining local and global dynamics of the system fig 7 the evolving dispersal probabilities of all species clearly correspond with the magnitude of population fluctuation figs 4 7 spearman s rank correlation rho between dispersal probabilities and cv of the global population size 0 82 s 110 330 0 85 s 95 726 and 0 80 s 124 410 for host parasitoid and hyperparasitoid species respectively higher search efficiency of hyperparasitoids leads to stronger population fluctuations and local extinction of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid populations occurs more often fig 5a b c d e f g h these cause stronger spatial and temporal variability oscillations of the systems for this reason in all species individuals with higher dispersal probabilities are selected for either too low or too high search efficiency of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid leads to a collapse of the tri trophic system with very low search efficiency of parasitoid a 0 001 the population of parasitoids is small and consequently only few parasitoid hosts are available for hyperparasitoids for this reason the hyperparasitoid metapopulation goes extinct in all replicates too low search efficiency of hyperparasitoids also leads to small hyperparasitoid metapopulation and increases extinction risk of hyperparasitoids due to demographic stochasticity and spatial mismatch with parasitoids at too high search efficiency of parasitoid or hyperparasitoid the local and global population dynamics of all three species are very strong fig 5d and h thus they often result in local extinction of local parasitoid and or hyperparasitoid population because of spatial mismatch between hyperparasitoids and parasitoids and ultimately extinction of the hyperparasitoid metapopulation in some replicates 3 2 2 effects of dispersal mortality in tri trophic system as expected an increase in dispersal mortality selects for lower dispersal probabilities in all three species fig 3a b and c higher dispersal mortality alone does not change local population dynamics of interacting species much fig 5 but it reduces the level of synchronization between patches we present the degree of local asynchrony within the system by using differences between global averaged to population size per patch and actual local population sizes fig 8 simulations with higher dispersal mortality exhibit greater local asynchrony than those with lower dispersal mortality fig 8 4 discussion in this study we show the effects of tri trophic interactions on the evolution of dispersal probability in three interacting species a host its parasitoid and its hyperparasitoid by allowing evolution of dispersal in all interacting partners we find that dispersal evolves differently in hosts parasitoids and hyperparasitoids moreover dispersal mortality influences the evolution of dispersal probabilities of the three species as well as the global persistence of the tri trophic system 4 1 dispersal evolution of three species our result confirms results found in previous studies for two species systems green 2009 chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a b i e that a high search efficiency of parasitoids can promote dispersal of interacting partners gray open circle line in fig 3 because host parasitoid interactions can lead to strong population oscillations that create spatio temporal variability in individual number and expected fitness across the patches of a metacommunity a dispersing host may immigrate into an empty patch thus avoiding both intra specific competition and parasitism or it may immigrate at least into a patch that is free of parasitoids in turn parasitoids must follow hosts and thus also evolve high dispersal probabilities typically the parasitoid dispersal probabilities are lower than host dispersal probabilities because parasitoids risk immigrating into patches where no hosts occur chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a the moment a hyperparasitoid species is added to the system dispersal probabilities of hosts and parasitoids evolve to quite different values than in the two species metacommunity parasitoids now evolve higher dispersal probabilities than hosts and hyperparasitoids evolve in most cases the highest dispersal probabilities from the perspective of hosts hyperparasitoids reduce parasitism pressure because the encounter probabilities between parasitoids and hosts are reduced in particular local host populations never go extinct if hyperparasitoids are present so that the advantage of colonizing an empty patch disappears for hosts consequently hosts evolve low dispersal probabilities parasitoids in turn face two principal selective pressures on their dispersal trait a mismatch with hosts population density due to community dynamics and host dispersal and the risk of attack by hyperparasitoids as just explained the former factor is weak as local populations of hosts remain more stable the evolution of high dispersal probabilities in parasitoids is mainly a response to hyperparasitism because dispersal from natal patches helps avoiding this threat for hyperparasitoids population size is usually the smallest among three species thus local and global dynamics of the hyperparasitoid populations fluctuate more than those of host and parasitoid populations including more frequent population extinctions than the other two species especially at high b for this reason it is beneficial for hyperparasitoids to evolve high dispersal probabilities due to frequent bottlenecks and founding events in addition such effects tend to increase kin structure with high relatedness within local patches a factor long known to promote the evolution of dispersal hamilton and may 1977 comins et al 1980 gandon and rousset 1999 bach et al 2006 poethke et al 2007 reviewed in ronce 2007 note that individual based simulations as ours account for kin effects by default poethke et al 2007 an inherent benefit of a simulation approach overall the interaction intensity we tested in this study have similar effects on dispersal evolution as presented in previous studies e g chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a 2012b larger efficiency generally results in higher dispersal probabilities because populations fluctuate more strongly and thus higher between patch variability is created in addition strong population dynamics also lead to reduction of effective population size and thus increase of kin competition which promotes dispersal poethke et al 2007 4 2 persistence of the system dispersal mortality has two implications for the tri trophic system first and obviously increasing dispersal mortality makes dispersal costlier and thus selects for lower emigration probabilities e g gandon and rousset 1999 bach et al 2006 second over the range of values tested increasing dispersal mortality also affects the global persistence of the system resulting in a wider range of persistence of the tri trophic system because lower dispersal promotes desynchronization of local dynamics in different parts of the metacommunity leading to globally more stable metacommunities statistical stabilization the summing over out of phase ﬂuctuations across the metacommunity results in globally more stable density it has been reported before that this mechanism can stabilize tri trophic systems reviewed in briggs and hoopes 2004 interestingly our results differ from other models by e g may and hassell 1981 and comins and hassell 1996 which indicated that in the host parasitoid hyperparasitoid system a higher searching efficiency and a much lower dispersal rate of hyperparasitoid than parasitoid was required for the coexistence of three species in our case we find that the three species can coexist even though the hyperparasitoid evolves higher dispersal probabilities than parasitoids moreover our system can persist although the search efficiency of hyperparasitoid is lower than that of parasitoid the main difference between our model and the previous studies is that in our study the host species underly density dependent population regulation and a holling s type ii functional response of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid was included in addition the parasitoid is quite abundant in the system thus the hyperparasitoid with low search efficiency could be more successful than in the other systems 4 3 empirical example according to the qualitative prediction from this tri trophic model hosts tend to be less dispersive than parasitoids and hyperparatoids respectively this is confirmed by an empirical study by nair et al 2016 who investigated spatial and temporal genetic structure of glanville fritillary butterfly melitaea cinxia its specialist parasitoid wasp hyposoter horticola and the ichneumon wasp mesochorus cf stigmaticusin hyperparasitizing on h horticola in fragmented landscape they found a lower genetic structure in the hyperparasitoid metapopulation than that of the parasitoid wasp and the butterfly population respectively this finding suggested that the hyperparasitoid species was more dispersive than the parasitoid and the host species respectively 5 conclusion this study shows an example of how interactions between multi trophic level can influence evolution of dispersal an introduction of hyperparasitoids into a host parasitoid system leads to weaken the parasitoids effect on its hosts and thus selects for lower dispersal of hosts at the same time hyperparasitism selects for higher parasitoid dispersal the intensity of interactions here modulated by search efficiency of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid and dispersal mortality play a key role in the determination of optimal dispersal strategy of three interaction species moreover they also affect the global stability of the tri trophic system theoretical studies on the evolution of dispersal are often restricted to one or two species systems and the results are often assumed as representative of natural systems however this prediction might not always be valid in real systems with complex interaction networks we show here that the results of dispersal evolution in multi trophic systems cannot be predicted from one or two species systems we thus suggest that more attention should be laid on dispersal evolution

pieris butterflies their primary parasitoid cotesia glomerata or c rubecula and their hyperparasitoids acrolyta nens lysibia nana pteromalus semotus mesochorus gemellus and baryscapus galactopus poelman et al 2012 we assumed that hosts parasitoids and hyperparasitoids have a synchronized and simple annual life cycle with discrete generations we assumed that all three species are haploid organisms reproducing asexually to avoid complications associated with sexual reproduction such as inbreeding depression recombination or an allee effect see kubisch et al 2011 the parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were specialized on attacking the larval stage of their hosts we assume that the larva stage is the target of attack by the antagonistic species the system is thus more stable and persist in wider parameter range than previous two species systems where adults are the targets for parasitoids chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a b in comparison the selective pressure of the antagonistic species attacking offspring is weaker than those attacking adults 2 1 the life cycle of host parasitoid and hyperparasitoid species the life cycle of the three species proceeded in the following sequence 1 host reproduction all hosts produced larvae with density dependent regulation and all adult hosts died directly after reproduction process 2 parasitoid reproduction following host reproduction host larvae could be attacked and killed by parasitoids to produce parasitoid larvae all adult parasitoids died thereafter 3 hyperparasitoid reproduction parasitoid larvae could be attacked and killed by adult hyperparasitoids to produce hyperparasitoid larvae all adult hyperparasitoids died after reproduction 4 maturation and dispersal surviving larvae of all species matured into adults matured individuals might disperse taking a defined dispersal risk dispersal mortality 5 dispersing and non dispersing individuals reproduced in the sequence as mentioned above and the life cycle of the three species is repeated fig 1 2 1 1 host reproduction local population of host species underlay density dependent regulation all host individuals in patch m at time t produced a number of larvae drawn from a poisson distribution with mean λ m t as calculated by the equation adapted from the beverton holt model beverton and holt 1981 1 λ m t λ 0 1 λ 0 1 k h m t where λ0 denotes the net reproductive rate k is the carrying capacity of a patch for the host species and h m t is the number of adult hosts in patch m at time t the total number of larvae produced in patch m at time t l h m t was then exposed to possible attack by parasitoids 2 1 2 parasitoid reproduction adult parasitoids attacked only host larvae before they became mature for any successful attack on hosts adult parasitoid individuals produced offspring with poisson distributed number of a mean value of u the risk of a host larva in patch m at time t to become infected by parasitoids p l h m t was calculated according to the nicholson bailey equation nicholson and bailey 1935 with a modified holling s type ii functional response holling 1959a 1959b 2 p l h m t 1 e x p a p m t 1 a l h m t where p m t is the number of adult parasitoids in patch m at time t a denotes the per capita efficiency of parasitoids searching for host larvae search efficiency of parasitoid the larger a the more efficiently parasitoids are in finding host larvae in all cases we assumed that the parasitoid s handling time was equal to one and was thus not included in the equation we regulated the interaction intensity between hosts and parasitoids only by changing the per capita search efficiency of parasitoid a whether a host larva was attacked was decided by drawing a random number from the interval 0 1 if the number was smaller than p l h m t the host larva was attacked by a randomly selected adult parasitoid from the parasitoid pool otherwise it was uninfected an attacked host larva was killed directly after a parasitoid encounter and was not attacked by another parasitoid however a parasitoid adult could attack more than one host larva sampling with replacement note that the expected number of parasitoid larvae generated before being attacked by hyperparasitoids l p m t was 3 l p m t u l h m t 1 e x p a p m t 1 a l h m t whereas the expected number of host larvae avoiding infection l h m t and later developing into adults was 4 l h m t l h m t e x p a p m t 1 a l h m t 2 1 3 hyperparasitoid reproduction adult hyperparasitoids attacked parasitoid larvae in the same way as adult parasitoids attack host larvae parasitoid larvae were attacked and killed by an adult hyperparasitoid before maturation and dispersal successful hyperparasitoid individuals produced a poisson distributed number of offspring with a mean value of v for each successful attack a parasitoid larva could be a host for only one hyperparasitoid adult but a hyperparasitoid adult could attack more than one parasitoid larva however the infection of parasitoids was independent from each other parasitoids emerging from the same host must not be attacked by a same hyperparasitoid the attack risk of a parasitoid larva in patch m at time t by a hyperparasitoid p l p m t was again calculated according to the nicholson bailey equation nicholson and bailey 1935 with a modified holling s type ii functional response holling 1959a 1959b 5 p l p m t 1 e x p b q m t 1 b l p m t where q m t denotes the number of adult hyperparasitoids in patch m at time t respectively and b is the per capita search efficiency of hyperparasitoid on parasitoids the larger b the more efficiently the hyperparasitoid can find parasitoid larvae the expected number of hyperparasitoid larvae produced in patch m at time step t l q m t was thus 6 l q m t v l p m t 1 e x p b q m t 1 b l p m t and the expected number of surviving parasitoid larvae l p m t was 7 l p m t l p m t e x p b q m t 1 b l p m t 2 1 4 maturation and dispersal surviving host parasitoid and all hyperparasitoid larvae turned into adults of the next generation members of all three species might before the onset of the next reproductive cycle perform dispersal according to the same rule an individual i decided either to disperse or remain in its natal patch depending on the genetically determined dispersal probability di a trait inherited from its parent see below and constrained to 0 di 1 whether an individual dispersed was decided by drawing a random number from the interval 0 1 if the number was smaller than di the individual dispersed otherwise it remained in its natal patch if an individual dispersed it moved randomly to one of the eight neighboring habitat patches moore neighborhood gray 2003 the parental dispersal trait was usually copied inherited to the offspring but the trait could mutate occasionally by drawing a random value from the uniform distribution 0 1 with mutation rate μ for all species μ is fixed at 0 001 we assumed that during dispersal an individual might die with a certain dispersal mortality c the dispersal mortality of all species was equal in all scenarios this should reflect a dispersal cost on any dispersing individual after all survivors had reached target patches they reproduced according to the description above we use terms dh dp and dq for host parasitoid hyperparasitoid dispersal probability trait respectively 2 2 scenarios and parameter values with the model we studied the effect of the intensity of species interaction modulated by search efficiency of parasitoid a and search efficiency of hyperparasitoid b on the evolution of dispersal probability both search efficiency of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were varied in a certain range see table 1 for more details the consistency of the results was tested under different dispersal mortality c 0 05 0 15 and 0 25 at these dispersal mortality values we observed significant differences in persistence range and evolving dispersal probabilities of the system as the system changed from almost global homogeneity at low dispersal mortality to more global desynchronization at higher dispersal mortality we assumed that a patch could support a large population of the host species k 1000 to avoid strong effects of demographic stochasticity and kin competition on dispersal evolution these effects become particularly important in small population poethke et al 2007 we chose a low value of the mean number of offspring for parasitoids and hyperparasitoids u v 2 because with too large u and v the tri trophic system typically collapsed extinction of at least one species a summary of all model parameters and their values is provided in table 1 2 3 initial conditions and analyses at the beginning of every simulation each patch was initialized with k host individuals k 1000 just 10 parasitoid individuals per patch and without hyperparasitoids to avoid the collapse of the host and or parasitoid metapopulation at the beginning of simulations in a non equilibrium phase ten hyperparasitoid individuals per patch were introduced into the system after iterating 100 generations of hosts and parasitoids the initial value for the dispersal probability of every individual of all three species was picked randomly from a uniform distribution 0 1 for the simulations we created a lattice landscape of dimension 32 32 1024 patches a single simulation ran over 2000 generations at this point ecological and evolutionary dynamics stabilized in all simulation without further systematic trends in population size or trait evolution supplementary fig a1 and a2 this does not exclude the establishment of stable oscillations where systems never reach a stable equilibrium e g in case of high search efficiency of hyperparasitoid where the dispersal probabilities of parasitoids and hyperparasitoids fluctuated over time for each parameter set we carried out twenty simulation replicates as a reference of evolving dispersal probabilities we also ran simulations for only two species system host and parasitoid with the same parameter combinations we explored the parameter ranges where the complete system could persist by counting the number of simulations out of 20 replicates where neither host parasitoid nor hyperparasitoid species went globally extinct within 2000 generations with some parameter combinations local and global populations of hosts parasitoids and hyperparasitoids fluctuated strongly over time resulting in the strong drift effects in small metapopulation supplementary fig a2 the global population of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid species could vary from a few hundred individuals to more than a hundred thousand individuals over time in some case supplementary fig a1 for this reason we calculated the mean dispersal probabilities of hosts parasitoids and hyperparasitoids over the last 100 generations of each simulation run for analysis for data presentation we averaged the mean of dispersal probabilities for each parameter combination from all replicates where all three species persisted for presentation of the magnitude of population fluctuation we calculated the coefficient of variation cv of the global population size for each species over the last 100 generations the correlation between the coefficient of variation cv of the global population size and averaged dispersal probabilities was presented by spearman s rank correlation rho because the dispersal probabilities of the three species was not normally distributed 3 results 3 1 persistence of the system the tri trophic system persists only in a limited range of the combinations of search efficiencies of parasitoid a and hyperparasitoid b tested fig 2 at the lowest dispersal mortality c 0 05 the persistence of hyperparasitoid species occurs only between a 0 003 and a 0 05 and between b 0 003 and b 0 03 fig 2a at some a and b values however the hyperparasitoid metapopulation persists in some but not all replicates at high a the host species and consequently the two other species too goes extinct in some replicates an increase in dispersal mortality widens the parameter range under which the complete tri trophic system can persist the persistence of the tri trophic system ranges from a 0 003 to 0 5 and from b 0 003 to 0 07 at c 0 15 and from b 0 003 to 0 1 at c 0 25 fig 2b and c 3 2 evolution of dispersal the distribution of dispersal probabilities within the global population is unimodal for the three species in all scenarios supplementary figure a3 shows examples of the distribution from some scenarios 3 2 1 the role of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid search efficiency an increase in search efficiency of hyperparasitoid leads to the evolution of higher dispersal probabilities in all three species whereas an increase in search efficiency of parasitoid results in an increase in dispersal probabilities of hosts and parasitoids but in a slight reduction of hyperparasitoid dispersal probabilities fig 3 shows examples for some b values the results for the complete combination of a and b is in fig 4 an increase in search efficiency of parasitoid promotes greater population size of hyperparasitoids because more parasitoids become available fig 5 a c b d e g f h spatial and temporal variability of hyperparasitoid populations is reduced and lower dispersal probabilities of hyperparasitoids are selected for the dispersal probabilities of host show strong correlation with those of parasitoid and the dispersal probabilities of parasitoids correlate with the hyperparasitoid dispersal probabilities fig 6 at all dispersal mortalities parasitoids evolve higher dispersal probabilities than hosts fig 6a while hyperparasitoid dispersal probabilities are higher than those of parasitoids when a and b are low but at high a and b the parasitoid species tends to disperse more than the hyperparasitoid species fig 6b search efficiency of hyperparasitoids is a key factor determining local and global dynamics of the system fig 7 the evolving dispersal probabilities of all species clearly correspond with the magnitude of population fluctuation figs 4 7 spearman s rank correlation rho between dispersal probabilities and cv of the global population size 0 82 s 110 330 0 85 s 95 726 and 0 80 s 124 410 for host parasitoid and hyperparasitoid species respectively higher search efficiency of hyperparasitoids leads to stronger population fluctuations and local extinction of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid populations occurs more often fig 5a b c d e f g h these cause stronger spatial and temporal variability oscillations of the systems for this reason in all species individuals with higher dispersal probabilities are selected for either too low or too high search efficiency of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid leads to a collapse of the tri trophic system with very low search efficiency of parasitoid a 0 001 the population of parasitoids is small and consequently only few parasitoid hosts are available for hyperparasitoids for this reason the hyperparasitoid metapopulation goes extinct in all replicates too low search efficiency of hyperparasitoids also leads to small hyperparasitoid metapopulation and increases extinction risk of hyperparasitoids due to demographic stochasticity and spatial mismatch with parasitoids at too high search efficiency of parasitoid or hyperparasitoid the local and global population dynamics of all three species are very strong fig 5d and h thus they often result in local extinction of local parasitoid and or hyperparasitoid population because of spatial mismatch between hyperparasitoids and parasitoids and ultimately extinction of the hyperparasitoid metapopulation in some replicates 3 2 2 effects of dispersal mortality in tri trophic system as expected an increase in dispersal mortality selects for lower dispersal probabilities in all three species fig 3a b and c higher dispersal mortality alone does not change local population dynamics of interacting species much fig 5 but it reduces the level of synchronization between patches we present the degree of local asynchrony within the system by using differences between global averaged to population size per patch and actual local population sizes fig 8 simulations with higher dispersal mortality exhibit greater local asynchrony than those with lower dispersal mortality fig 8 4 discussion in this study we show the effects of tri trophic interactions on the evolution of dispersal probability in three interacting species a host its parasitoid and its hyperparasitoid by allowing evolution of dispersal in all interacting partners we find that dispersal evolves differently in hosts parasitoids and hyperparasitoids moreover dispersal mortality influences the evolution of dispersal probabilities of the three species as well as the global persistence of the tri trophic system 4 1 dispersal evolution of three species our result confirms results found in previous studies for two species systems green 2009 chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a b i e that a high search efficiency of parasitoids can promote dispersal of interacting partners gray open circle line in fig 3 because host parasitoid interactions can lead to strong population oscillations that create spatio temporal variability in individual number and expected fitness across the patches of a metacommunity a dispersing host may immigrate into an empty patch thus avoiding both intra specific competition and parasitism or it may immigrate at least into a patch that is free of parasitoids in turn parasitoids must follow hosts and thus also evolve high dispersal probabilities typically the parasitoid dispersal probabilities are lower than host dispersal probabilities because parasitoids risk immigrating into patches where no hosts occur chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a the moment a hyperparasitoid species is added to the system dispersal probabilities of hosts and parasitoids evolve to quite different values than in the two species metacommunity parasitoids now evolve higher dispersal probabilities than hosts and hyperparasitoids evolve in most cases the highest dispersal probabilities from the perspective of hosts hyperparasitoids reduce parasitism pressure because the encounter probabilities between parasitoids and hosts are reduced in particular local host populations never go extinct if hyperparasitoids are present so that the advantage of colonizing an empty patch disappears for hosts consequently hosts evolve low dispersal probabilities parasitoids in turn face two principal selective pressures on their dispersal trait a mismatch with hosts population density due to community dynamics and host dispersal and the risk of attack by hyperparasitoids as just explained the former factor is weak as local populations of hosts remain more stable the evolution of high dispersal probabilities in parasitoids is mainly a response to hyperparasitism because dispersal from natal patches helps avoiding this threat for hyperparasitoids population size is usually the smallest among three species thus local and global dynamics of the hyperparasitoid populations fluctuate more than those of host and parasitoid populations including more frequent population extinctions than the other two species especially at high b for this reason it is beneficial for hyperparasitoids to evolve high dispersal probabilities due to frequent bottlenecks and founding events in addition such effects tend to increase kin structure with high relatedness within local patches a factor long known to promote the evolution of dispersal hamilton and may 1977 comins et al 1980 gandon and rousset 1999 bach et al 2006 poethke et al 2007 reviewed in ronce 2007 note that individual based simulations as ours account for kin effects by default poethke et al 2007 an inherent benefit of a simulation approach overall the interaction intensity we tested in this study have similar effects on dispersal evolution as presented in previous studies e g chaianunporn and hovestadt 2012a 2012b larger efficiency generally results in higher dispersal probabilities because populations fluctuate more strongly and thus higher between patch variability is created in addition strong population dynamics also lead to reduction of effective population size and thus increase of kin competition which promotes dispersal poethke et al 2007 4 2 persistence of the system dispersal mortality has two implications for the tri trophic system first and obviously increasing dispersal mortality makes dispersal costlier and thus selects for lower emigration probabilities e g gandon and rousset 1999 bach et al 2006 second over the range of values tested increasing dispersal mortality also affects the global persistence of the system resulting in a wider range of persistence of the tri trophic system because lower dispersal promotes desynchronization of local dynamics in different parts of the metacommunity leading to globally more stable metacommunities statistical stabilization the summing over out of phase ﬂuctuations across the metacommunity results in globally more stable density it has been reported before that this mechanism can stabilize tri trophic systems reviewed in briggs and hoopes 2004 interestingly our results differ from other models by e g may and hassell 1981 and comins and hassell 1996 which indicated that in the host parasitoid hyperparasitoid system a higher searching efficiency and a much lower dispersal rate of hyperparasitoid than parasitoid was required for the coexistence of three species in our case we find that the three species can coexist even though the hyperparasitoid evolves higher dispersal probabilities than parasitoids moreover our system can persist although the search efficiency of hyperparasitoid is lower than that of parasitoid the main difference between our model and the previous studies is that in our study the host species underly density dependent population regulation and a holling s type ii functional response of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid was included in addition the parasitoid is quite abundant in the system thus the hyperparasitoid with low search efficiency could be more successful than in the other systems 4 3 empirical example according to the qualitative prediction from this tri trophic model hosts tend to be less dispersive than parasitoids and hyperparatoids respectively this is confirmed by an empirical study by nair et al 2016 who investigated spatial and temporal genetic structure of glanville fritillary butterfly melitaea cinxia its specialist parasitoid wasp hyposoter horticola and the ichneumon wasp mesochorus cf stigmaticusin hyperparasitizing on h horticola in fragmented landscape they found a lower genetic structure in the hyperparasitoid metapopulation than that of the parasitoid wasp and the butterfly population respectively this finding suggested that the hyperparasitoid species was more dispersive than the parasitoid and the host species respectively 5 conclusion this study shows an example of how interactions between multi trophic level can influence evolution of dispersal an introduction of hyperparasitoids into a host parasitoid system leads to weaken the parasitoids effect on its hosts and thus selects for lower dispersal of hosts at the same time hyperparasitism selects for higher parasitoid dispersal the intensity of interactions here modulated by search efficiency of parasitoid and hyperparasitoid and dispersal mortality play a key role in the determination of optimal dispersal strategy of three interaction species moreover they also affect the global stability of the tri trophic system theoretical studies on the evolution of dispersal are often restricted to one or two species systems and the results are often assumed as representative of natural systems however this prediction might not always be valid in real systems with complex interaction networks we show here that the results of dispersal evolution in multi trophic systems cannot be predicted from one or two species systems we thus suggest that more attention should be laid on dispersal evolution

25116,fire simulators allow predicting fire spread and behavior and some of which in real time both strategies and tactics to suppress wildland fires depend on fire analysis which is generally based on fire simulations that need to be accurate for a proper decision making however limitations and assumptions of the fire models and uncertainties in input data may induce errors in the simulated fire growth and therefore fire simulations do not always match actual fire spread in this paper we show an innovative method implemented in wildfire analyst to adjust fire simulations in real time the method determines the adjustment factors needed for the optimal rate of spread by fuel model in order to minimize the arrival time error between the simulated fire and a set of control points where the arrival time of the observed real fire is known two case studies were used to present the method showing robust results in reducing the error and fitting the simulated fire growth to the real fire spread with practical real time implications the method presented may be solved in real time and used with any empirical fire propagation keywords fire modelling ros adjustment factors uncertainties fire simulation 1 introduction catastrophic wildfires occurring under extreme weather conditions challenge fire suppression capabilities in many countries cardil et al 2015 molina terrén et al 2016 every year millions of hectares of forest are burned damaging and destroying human settlements and ecosystems and putting at risk human lives cardil et al 2017 cardil and molina 2015 diakakis et al 2016 this has been reported in several countries barriopedro et al 2011 cardil et al 2015 salis et al 2013 wotton et al 2010 such as portugal 2003 2017 greece 2007 russia 2010 usa 2000 2006 2007 2017 canada 2004 2016 australia 2005 2006 2009 2011 2012 and chile 2017 several climate change scenarios indicate a probable increase in wildfire occurrence kalabokidis et al 2015 krawchuk et al 2009 liu et al 2010 moritz et al 2012 westerling et al 2006 and as wildland urban interface increases miller and wade 2003 viegas 2009 the frequency of these wildfires injuring or taking the lives of humans is likely to increase at a commensurate rate fire simulation and modelling based allow characterizing and predicting fire spread and behavior in diverse and complex fire conditions albini 1976 finney

strategy and tactics ramirez et al 2011 fire propagation modelling is also used during wildfire prevention and planning to conduct prescribed fires and assess the effectiveness of fuel treatments anderson et al 2009 cruz 2010 pimont et al 2016 current empirical fire propagation models and simulators are the product of decades of intense fire modeling research and experimentation sullivan 2009 many fire modeling simulators have been developed such as farsite finney 1998 nexus scott 1999 flammap finney 2006 behaveplus andrews 2014 forefire balbi et al 2009 and wildfire analyst wfa ramirez et al 2011 most simulators can predict fire spread and behavior forward in time propagation to estimate rate of spread ros flame length or minimum travel time paths mmt with a relatively high degree of accuracy using variables such as ignition location fuel type fuel moisture weather and topography alcasena et al 2016 the capability of accurately predicting fire spread is associated to uncertainties that may undermine the utility of such predictions for real time operational fire suppression decision making alexander and cruz 2013 bachmann and allgöwer 2002 benali et al 2017 uncertainty may come

of ros to adjust simulated fire growth to real fire spread in behave and farsite fire simulators respectively these factors are fuel model specific and are included as input data in equations of the fire spread model multiplying the initial ros by the adjustment factor fire analysts assessed these adjustment factors manually trying to find the best adjustments iteratively in addition to the errors derived from analysts conducting a manual process it was a very time consuming task and difficult to be applied in an emergency we present in this study a method to be solved in real time i e a few seconds to adjust fire simulations automatically using two case studies this allowed extracting control points to adjust the fire simulation and to assess the accuracy of simulated fire growth before and after the adjustment 2 methods 2 1 study cases in order to show the adjustment method we used two case studies in catalonia a region located in ne spain with a land area of 32 115 km2 fig 1 it has a mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and low winter precipitation regos et al 2014 the vegetation is mostly comprised of evergreen sclerophyllous leaved shrublands semi deciduous scrub pine stands and woodlands keeley 2012 regos et al 2014 two fires castell d aro and san llorenç savall were chosen as case studies given that they were well monitored by firefighters throughout suppression operations bombers de la generalitat de catalunya graf team table 1 and fig 1 allowing testing the adjustment method castell d aro burned 434 ha approximately it was a wind driven fire that occurred under a heat wave from the sahara with hot dry winds pushing from the south high fuel loads with a dense understory mostly rothermel fuel model 4 and low fuel moisture supported by the interaction between topography and wind influenced the fire spread with large flames and a high fire rate of spread san llorenç savall was a large wind driven wildland fire burned over 4500 ha weather conditions were extreme with air temperature higher than 36 c air relative humidity lower than 20 and moderate southern winds 1 5 m s fire burned an unmanaged forest of pinus halepensis mill and pinus nigra arnold with a very dense understory of flammable species it had two ignition points that promoted two different fires that were merged into a single one the first fire run was developed on 10 august 2003 run 1 and the second one on 11 august 2003 run 2 fig 2 fire propagation simulations were adjusted using the fire monitoring by firefighters castell d aro fire was adjusted 1 h after the fire start and it was simulated during the total fire duration 2 5 h table 1 regarding san llorenç savall we adjusted both runs 1 and 2 independently 2 and 3 h after the start of the fires respectively table 2 in this case we simulated fire growth for 5 h until 23 50 in run 1 and 7 h until 18 00 in run 2 respectively 2 2 simulated fire growth and input data fire growth simulations and their adjustments were done using wildfire analyst ramirez et al 2011 wfa is a software that provides real time analysis of wildfire behavior and simulates the spread of wildfires to directly support multi agency wildfire incident management rothermel 1972 equations were used to simulate fire behavior and spread and the dead fuel moisture was estimated using nelson equations nelson 2000 required spatial inputs include topography fuel canopy cover weather data wind speed and direction temperature relative humidity fuel moisture and ignition location input data sources are shown in table 1 we used weather data from santa coloma of farners and san llorenç savall meteorological stations located 12 and 1 km away from castell d aro and san llorenç savall fire starting points respectively data from both meteorological stations was representative for both fires and it was validated by firefighters through mobile weather stations near the fire perimeters bombers de la generalitat de catalunya graf team dynamic inputs such as weather were updated every hour for both fires wind speed and direction were modelled using windninja forthofer et al 2009 a software that computes spatially varying wind fields for wildland fire applications in complex terrain the windninja model is embedded in wfa 2 3 adjustment mode divergences between the simulated fire growth and real fire spread may be caused by multiple factors such as massive spotting active crown fire runs inaccuracies in input data as well as limitations and lack of fire model calibration at local scales after the revision of the potential sources of divergency between the simulated fire growth and real fire spread wfa can be used to adjust simulated fire growth to the observed fire progression in order to provide more accurate and reliable estimations of future fire behavior using ros adjustment factors therefore wfa includes a data assimilation technique capable of quickly adjusting simulations to observed fire behavior the strength of the method is that it is not recursive and may be solved almost instantaneously providing a very clear and easy way to interpret adjustments for fire managers at an operational level and that it requires very few inputs artès et al 2015 ramirez et al 2011 adjustment data can be comprised of a set of control points or lines where the arrival time of the real fire is known the method is based on determining of the best ros adjustment factors rothermel and rinehart 1983 using a least squares approach to minimize the error between the simulated fire growth and the real fire these factors are fuel model specific mathematically the method searches for the optimal adjustment factors adjj that multiply the initial ros of the simulated fire over each fuel type j minimizing the following functional t tα 2 λ 1 1 α 2 here is the euclidean length the elements tij of t represent the time spent by the fire over fuel type j on the ith control path the curve perpendicular to the isochrones and linking the ignition source with the control point ti of t represents the observed real arrival time at the ith control point αj 1 adjj is the inverse of the adjustment over a fuel type j and the parameter λ 0 may be seen as a tuning strength variable that may be selected by the user a high value of λ will minimize as much as possible the arrival time errors at control points no matter the required adjustments and as λ decreases adjustment will be more realistic closer to 1 but the algorithm will have less strength and time errors at control points could be higher the least square problem gives the same weight to each cell ensemble inside of the matrix those cells in the firepaths connecting the ignition source to the control points and therefore will give more relevance to those fuels that are more abundant than those that are scarce for example the adjustment factor of a fuel type that is only represented by very few cells is not very reliable since any change in the factor of that fuel will barely affect the final arrival time at the control point we used different indexes and variables in order to assess the accuracy of fire simulations before and after the adjustment and compare both outcomes 1 time error in the control points used in the adjustment mode and final fire perimeter it means the difference in terms of time of arrival between the simulated fire growth and real fire spread 2 omission and commission errors in terms of burned area between the fire simulation and final fire perimeter 3 sørensen s coefficient sc legendre and legendre 1998 calculated as follows s c 2 a 2 a b c where a is the area coded as burned for both the fire simulation and final fire perimeter b is the area coded as burned in the simulation and unburned in the final fire perimeter and c is the area coded as unburned in the simulation and burned in the final fire perimeter sc coefficient values range between 0 and 1 with values close to 1 indicating very high spatial agreement between simulated and final fire perimeter 3 results fire simulations for castell d aro and san llorenç savall fires without any adjustment did not accurately represent the real fire spread because of both simulations notably underestimated the real ros fig 2 mainly in the head of the fires the adjustment mode computed ros adjustment factors for all fuel models involved in the fire simulations table 2 to minimize the error between the fire simulation and the real fire spread all ros adjustment factors had values higher than 1 which means that the fire simulator on these fuel models underestimated ros in the fire simulation without adjustments initial and final fire simulations with the adjustments are shown in fig 2 adjustment factor for the castell d aro fire varied by fuel model with fuel models 2 and 4 having the most relevance due to a higher number of cells involved in the adjustment method table 2 twentynine control points were used in the adjustment mode from a known control line at 1 h after the fire start the high number of control points ensures a more representative least square matrix and a more stable solution of the adjustment problem initial average time error was 1 11 h ranging between 0 92 and 1 75 h considering the error in each control point standard error se 0 052 average time error decreased significantly down to 0 24 h p value 0 001 after the adjustment process with values ranging between 0 11 and 0 56 h se 0 025 final average error of the adjusted fire simulation considering the whole fire duration was 0 21 h se 0 056 in terms of burned area the omission error significantly decreased from 297 to 30 ha after using the adjustment factors although the commission error increased from 10 to 90 ha the high agreement between the final fire perimeter and fire simulation in terms of burned area improved the sc from 0 49 to 0 87 when using the adjustments we did two independent simulations and adjustments in san llorenç savall fire one for each fire run the adjustment mode provided similar adjustment factors for fuel model 4 but differed for fuel model 6 in both fire runs table 2 fuel model

runs after using the adjustment factors fire run 1 from 0 61 to 0 76 fire run 2 from 0 52 to 0 72 omission errors were high without adjustments because of fire simulations for both fire runs notably underestimated the real ros however commission errors were higher in fire simulations with the ros adjustment factors mainly due to fire spread on fire flanks 4 discussion fire analysts and managers need to have consistent and reliable fire simulations sá et al 2017 especially in a real time scenario where decisions have to be made in a short time interval adjusted fire simulations are needed to predict future fire behavior and spread for different purposes such as assessing evacuation times of a wildland urban interface or implementing fire suppression maneuvers monedero et al 2017 historically adjusting rothermel based ros using field observations in real time simulations was a challenge for fire analysts considering the time consuming nature of conducting calculations stratton 2006 however as this study illustrates wfa is capable of calibrating fire propagation simulations in real time based on observed fire time of arrival fire simulations by using rothermel 1972 equations without adjustments for castell d aro and san llorenç savall fires underestimated ros however the adjustment mode of wfa greatly improved the outcomes with final simulated fire spread aligning well with field observations and significantly diminishing both burned area and time errors the case studies showed how this mode is helpful to reconstruct more accurately past fires and analyze fire spread and behavior although reconstructions can be done by assessing ros adjustment factors manually time and effort required to assess ros adjustment factors is usually higher than with the adjustment mode of wfa additionally wfa provides a quantitative method of determining the ros adjustment factors needed to more accurately simulate on going and past fires and also provides analysts with time error estimates the method is especially useful in suppression situations where providing more accurate estimates of fire spread can be critically important for the development of strategy and tactics the algorithms may be solved almost instantaneously and as shown in the case studies the adjustment mode of wfa could be used for a better prediction of fire spread there are several key considerations to take into account when using the adjustment mode of wfa 1 the method only adjusts those fuel models included in the adjustment simulation mode therefore if other fuel models are present when predicting fire spread forward in time fire simulation results could be influenced by them and other re adjustment may be useful and or necessary 2 potential error sources that can cause an overestimation or underestimation of initial fire simulations should be considered for instance local winds not considered in the initial fire simulation in singular areas could modify ros in a different way than in other areas 3 the more data is injected in the algorithm lines or points the more constrained and reliable results are expected to be 4 time between the fire start and control points need to be precise given that the adjustment depends on distance and time 5 control fire data should be from unrestricted fire spread areas in order to adjust the fire simulations with a free fire spread 6 fuels representing a very small percentage of the area are recommended to be manually fixed since they minimally impact overall fire behavior and may have unrealistic adjustment values for instance san llorenç savall fire showed similar ros adjustment values for the most relevant fuel model fuel model 4 between the two runs but high differences in a non relevant fuel model fuel model 6 table 2 7 wfa has implemented a tuning strength mode that allows modifying and varying fuel model adjustments while quantify the new time error of the simulation assumptions and limitations of fire simulators and lack of calibration of local fuel models as well as inaccuracies in input data may induce errors in predicting simulated fire growth arca et al 2007 bachmann and allgöwer 2002 jahdi et al 2016 sá et al 2017 also adverse fire spread patterns and behavior may influence the final accuracy of the simulated fire growth for instance convective driven fires are common under extreme weather conditions cardil et al 2016 molina terrén and cardil 2016 developing a fire behavior with massive spotting active crown fire or create their own weather environment duane et al 2016 molina et al 2010 all these scenarios are usually difficult to predict and simulate especially using semi empiric fire spread models these processes usually accelerate fire spread and increase risk to firefighters and communities thus there are several sources of error when simulating fire spread and it is essential to consider them to reduce uncertainty and more accurately adjust simulation parameters the adjustment approach is not limited to measurements by firefighters in real time castell d aro and san llorenç savall fires wildland fire growth simulation adjustment can be done through other sources that provide the fire location at a given time data from unmanned aerial vehicles uavs watts et al 2012 gps locations from suppression resources or satellite active fire data coen and schroeder 2013 may be useful data to adjust fires even in a remote way several studies monitored and analyzed spatial dynamics of large wildfires using satellite active fire data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis or the visible infrared imager radiometer suite viirs jin et al 2015 sá et al 2017 a cost effective alternative to acquire information systematically pinheiro and bates 2000 while active fire satellite observations can be used to assess ros adjustments and validate fire models and simulators further research is needed to address challenges presented by short fires small fires not captured by remote sensing data fast moving fires that exceed satellite return intervals percentage of cloud clover dense smoke plumes hantson et al 2013 or satellite sensor detection capabilities oliva and schroeder 2015 sá et al 2017 5 conclusion fire simulations may differ from real fire spread due to assumptions and limitations of fire models lack of calibration of local fuel models and inaccuracies in input data the most efficient way to adjust the simulated fire growth during suppression operations is to quickly integrate field observations as calibration data and re run fire simulations herein we showed that simulations can be adjusted in real time to support operational planning and decision making adjustment mode of wfa quickly calculated ros adjustment factors for two large wildland fires and significantly reduced time errors this method allows for rapid assimilation of fire spread observations into simulations and can be used to generate a more accurate forecast of fire spread as the fire progresses the method can be powered through field observation from firefighters data from unmanned aerial vehicles gps locations

25116,fire simulators allow predicting fire spread and behavior and some of which in real time both strategies and tactics to suppress wildland fires depend on fire analysis which is generally based on fire simulations that need to be accurate for a proper decision making however limitations and assumptions of the fire models and uncertainties in input data may induce errors in the simulated fire growth and therefore fire simulations do not always match actual fire spread in this paper we show an innovative method implemented in wildfire analyst to adjust fire simulations in real time the method determines the adjustment factors needed for the optimal rate of spread by fuel model in order to minimize the arrival time error between the simulated fire and a set of control points where the arrival time of the observed real fire is known two case studies were used to present the method showing robust results in reducing the error and fitting the simulated fire growth to the real fire spread with practical real time implications the method presented may be solved in real time and used with any empirical fire propagation keywords fire modelling ros adjustment factors uncertainties

canada 2004 2016 australia 2005 2006 2009 2011 2012 and chile 2017 several climate change scenarios indicate a probable increase in wildfire occurrence kalabokidis et al 2015 krawchuk et al 2009 liu et al 2010 moritz et al 2012 westerling et al 2006 and as wildland urban interface increases miller and wade 2003 viegas 2009 the frequency of these wildfires injuring or taking the lives of humans is likely to increase at a commensurate rate fire simulation and modelling based allow characterizing and predicting fire spread and behavior in diverse and complex fire conditions albini 1976 finney

anderson et al 2009 cruz 2010 pimont et al 2016 current empirical fire propagation models and simulators are the product of decades of intense fire modeling research and experimentation sullivan 2009 many fire modeling simulators have been developed such as farsite finney 1998 nexus scott 1999 flammap finney 2006 behaveplus andrews 2014 forefire balbi et al 2009 and wildfire analyst wfa ramirez et

of ros to adjust simulated fire growth to real fire spread in behave and farsite fire simulators respectively these factors are fuel model specific and are included as input data in equations of the fire spread model multiplying the initial ros by the adjustment factor fire analysts assessed these adjustment factors manually trying to find the best adjustments iteratively in addition to the errors derived from analysts conducting a manual process it was a very time consuming task and difficult to be applied in an emergency we present in this study a method to be solved in real time i e a few seconds to adjust fire simulations automatically using two case studies this allowed extracting control points to adjust the fire simulation and to assess the accuracy of simulated fire growth before and after the adjustment 2 methods 2 1 study cases in order to show the adjustment method we used two case studies in catalonia a region located in ne spain with a land area of 32 115 km2 fig 1 it has a mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and low winter precipitation regos et al 2014 the vegetation is mostly comprised of evergreen sclerophyllous leaved shrublands semi deciduous scrub pine stands and woodlands keeley 2012 regos et al 2014 two fires castell d aro and san llorenç savall were chosen as case studies given that they were well monitored by firefighters throughout suppression operations bombers de la generalitat de catalunya graf team table 1 and fig 1 allowing testing the adjustment method castell d aro burned 434 ha approximately it was a wind driven fire that occurred under a heat wave from the sahara with hot dry winds pushing from the south high fuel loads with a dense understory mostly rothermel fuel model 4 and low fuel moisture supported by the interaction between topography and wind influenced the fire spread with large flames and a high fire rate of spread san llorenç savall was a large wind driven wildland fire burned over 4500 ha weather conditions were extreme with air temperature higher than 36 c air relative humidity lower than 20 and moderate southern winds 1 5 m s fire burned an unmanaged forest of pinus halepensis mill and pinus nigra arnold with a very dense understory of flammable species it had two ignition points that promoted two different fires that were merged into a single one the first fire run was developed on 10 august 2003 run 1 and the second one on 11 august 2003 run 2 fig 2 fire propagation simulations were adjusted using the fire monitoring by firefighters castell d aro fire was adjusted 1 h after the fire start and it was simulated during the total fire duration 2 5 h table 1 regarding san llorenç savall we adjusted both runs 1 and 2 independently 2 and 3 h after the start of the fires respectively table 2 in this case we simulated fire growth for 5 h until 23 50 in run 1 and 7 h until 18 00 in run 2 respectively 2 2 simulated fire growth and input data fire growth simulations and their adjustments were done using wildfire analyst ramirez et al 2011 wfa is a software that provides real time analysis of wildfire behavior and simulates the spread of wildfires to directly support multi agency wildfire incident management rothermel 1972 equations were used to simulate fire behavior and spread and the dead fuel moisture was estimated using nelson equations nelson 2000 required spatial inputs include topography fuel canopy cover weather data wind speed and direction temperature relative humidity fuel moisture and ignition location input data sources are shown in table 1 we used weather data from santa coloma of farners and san llorenç savall meteorological stations located 12 and 1 km away from castell d aro and san llorenç savall fire starting points respectively data from both meteorological stations was representative for both fires and it was validated by firefighters through mobile weather stations near the fire perimeters bombers de la generalitat de catalunya graf team dynamic inputs such as weather were updated every hour for both fires wind speed and direction were modelled using windninja forthofer et al 2009 a software that computes spatially varying wind fields for wildland fire applications in complex terrain the windninja model is embedded in wfa 2 3 adjustment mode divergences between the simulated fire growth and real fire spread may be caused by multiple factors such as massive spotting active crown fire runs inaccuracies in input data as well as limitations and lack of fire model calibration at local scales after the revision of the potential sources of divergency between the simulated fire growth and real fire spread wfa can be used to adjust simulated fire growth to the observed fire progression in order to provide more accurate and reliable estimations of future fire behavior using ros adjustment factors therefore wfa includes a data assimilation technique capable of quickly adjusting simulations to observed fire behavior the strength of the method is that it is not recursive and may be solved almost instantaneously providing a very clear and easy way to interpret adjustments for fire managers at an operational level and that it requires very few inputs artès et al 2015 ramirez et al 2011 adjustment data can be comprised of a set of control points or lines where the arrival time of the real fire is known the method is based on determining of the best ros adjustment factors rothermel and rinehart 1983 using a least squares approach to minimize the error between the simulated fire growth and the real fire these factors are fuel model specific mathematically the method searches for the optimal adjustment factors adjj that multiply the initial ros of the simulated fire over each fuel type j minimizing the following functional t tα 2 λ 1 1 α 2 here is the euclidean length the elements tij of t represent the time spent by the fire over fuel type j on the ith control path the curve perpendicular to the isochrones and linking the ignition source with the control point ti of t represents the observed real arrival time at the ith control point αj 1 adjj is the inverse of the adjustment over a fuel type j and the parameter λ 0 may be seen as a tuning strength variable that may be selected by the user a high value of λ will minimize as much as possible the arrival time errors at control points no matter the required adjustments and as λ decreases adjustment will be more realistic closer to 1 but the algorithm will have less strength and time errors at control points could be higher the least square problem gives the same weight to each cell ensemble inside of the matrix those cells in the firepaths connecting the ignition source to the control points and therefore will give more relevance to those fuels that are more abundant than those that are scarce for example the adjustment factor of a fuel type that is only represented by very few cells is not very reliable since any change in the factor of that fuel will barely affect the final arrival time at the control point we used different indexes and variables in order to assess the accuracy of fire simulations before and after the adjustment and compare both outcomes 1 time error in the control points used in the adjustment mode and final fire perimeter it means the difference in terms of time of arrival between the simulated fire growth and real fire spread 2 omission and commission errors in terms of burned area between the fire simulation and final fire perimeter 3 sørensen s coefficient sc legendre and legendre 1998 calculated as follows s c 2 a 2 a b c where a is the area coded as burned for both the fire simulation and final fire perimeter b is the area coded as burned in the simulation and unburned in the final fire perimeter and c is the area coded as unburned in the simulation and burned in the final fire perimeter sc coefficient values range between 0 and 1 with values close to 1 indicating very high spatial agreement between simulated and final fire perimeter 3 results fire simulations for castell d aro and san llorenç savall fires without any adjustment did not accurately represent the real fire spread because of both simulations notably underestimated the real ros fig 2 mainly in the head of the fires the adjustment mode computed ros adjustment factors for all fuel models involved in the fire simulations table 2 to minimize the error between the fire simulation and the real fire spread all ros adjustment factors had values higher than 1 which means that the fire simulator on these fuel models underestimated ros in the fire simulation without adjustments initial and final fire simulations with the adjustments are shown in fig 2 adjustment factor for the castell d aro fire varied by fuel model with fuel models 2 and 4 having the most relevance due to a higher number of cells involved in the adjustment method table 2 twentynine control points were

high agreement between the final fire perimeter and fire simulation in terms of burned area improved the sc from 0 49 to 0 87 when using the adjustments we did two independent simulations and adjustments in san llorenç savall fire one for each fire run the adjustment mode provided similar adjustment factors for fuel model 4 but differed for fuel model 6 in both fire runs table 2 fuel model

runs after using the adjustment factors fire run 1 from 0 61 to 0 76 fire run 2 from 0 52 to 0 72 omission errors were high without adjustments because of fire simulations for both fire runs notably underestimated the real ros however commission errors were higher in fire simulations with the ros adjustment factors mainly due to fire spread on fire flanks 4 discussion fire analysts and managers need to have consistent and reliable fire simulations sá et al 2017 especially in a real time scenario where decisions have to be made in a short time interval adjusted fire simulations are needed to

historically adjusting rothermel based ros using field observations in real time simulations was a challenge for fire analysts considering the time consuming nature of conducting calculations stratton 2006 however as this study illustrates wfa is capable of calibrating fire propagation simulations in real time based on observed fire time of arrival fire simulations by using rothermel 1972 equations without adjustments for castell d aro and san llorenç savall fires underestimated ros however the adjustment mode of wfa greatly improved the outcomes with final simulated fire spread aligning well with field observations and significantly diminishing both burned area and time errors the case studies showed how this mode is helpful to reconstruct more accurately past fires and analyze fire spread and behavior although reconstructions can be done by assessing ros adjustment factors manually time and effort required to assess ros adjustment factors is usually higher than with the

25117,smooth cordgrass spartina alterniflora is a perennial grass species that forms distinctive colonies on mudflats such colonies can increase their size by expanding clonally to surrounding open mudflats and their number by establishing new colonies on far away from the original colonies either by sexual reproduction or rhizome fragmentation in this work we aimed to link colony dynamics mechanisms lateral growth and recruitment to reproduce the overall population dynamics of spartina alterniflora in an integrative manner the proposed model describes a population as a collection of age structured colonies randomly distributed in a habitat area by applying a mean field approach for spatial dimensions we derive dynamics of how the expected proportion of an area occupied by these colonies would disperse over time we derive a parameter describing the contribution of lateral growth and recruitment to population i e the growth potential this growth potential is proportional to the geometrical mean of the lateral growth speed and recruitment rate representing the average growth rate including these two mechanisms moreover we show that lateral growth rather than recruitment addresses transitional dynamics of stable age structure developments the ratio between colony mortality and growth potential determines the equilibrium proportion of area occupied by these colonies the application of this model to s alterniflora population dynamics would be feasible across a wide range of populations determined by the spatial occupations of growing colonies keywords perennial plant population population dynamics age structured population poisson point process spatially implicit model 1 introduction we present a theoretical model for investigating the population dynamics of spartina alterniflora smooth cordgrass being one of 14 spartina species s alterniflora forms dense clonal colonies on open mudflats an invasion of this species can transform open mudflats into dense meadows and can alter such ecosystems e g by reducing the diversity of shorebirds and fish callaway and josselyn 1992 neira et al 2005 wang et al 2008 as a result despite an initial expectation for managing seashores using s alterniflora its negative ecological impacts in mudflat environments now overshadow its benefit adams et al 2012 an et al 2007 wang et al 2008 a population of s alterniflora on a mudflat consists of many circular colonies of various sizes civille et al 2005 feist and simenstad 2000 marangoni and costa 2012 taylor et al 2004 this species recruits new colonies either by seed reproduction or vegetative fragmentation with their size increased by lateral clonal growth bush 2002 daehler and strong 1994 colonies eventually grow large enough to overlap merging into a single large colony these two basic mechanisms i e the recruitment of new colonies and the lateral growth of existing colonies determine colony dynamics in an integrative manner including spatial overlaps among colonies therefore it is important to understand how these basic mechanisms determine the dynamics of a colonial population in relation to the growth mechanisms and area limitation because of its high invasive nature and large impact on native mudflat ecosystems s alterniflora has been the subject of many theoretical studies these studies have proposed theoretical models that range from spatially explicit models using numerical computations ge et al 2015 grevstad 2005 huang et al 2008 liu et al 2014 murphy et al 2013 murphy and johnson 2015 taylor et al 2004 to models based on analyses of deterministic and stochastic dynamics buhle et al 2012 dennis et al 2011 taylor et al 2004 taylor and hastings 2004 yang et al 2014 such models have examined the effect of species life history traits dispersing mechanisms of populations including the allee effect murphy and johnson 2015 taylor et al 2004 and been applied to yield effective control management strategies buhle et al 2012 grevstad 2005 murphy et al 2013 taylor and hastings 2004 other studies have considered competition among multiple spartina species and other plant species on mudflats ge et al 2015 huang et al 2008 theoretical studies comparing control strategies on growth factors have often indicated larger effects for strategies that focus on open edges of clonal colonies rather than on colony

except for yang et al 2014 are based on numerical investigations of their respective models it is unclear why these recommendations are effective or ineffective in practice therefore we need formulations describing how recruitments and lateral growth determine population dynamics of spartina colonies to help explain the background mechanisms of these recommendations in this study we propose a new deterministic model of s alterniflora populations that is backed up by a mathematical framework describing geometrical properties of particles that distribute randomly on space matheron 1974 stoyan and mecke 2005 using the model we investigate how two key parameters i e lateral growth and recruitment of colonies determine the dynamics of an area occupied by these colonies under a framework of the age structure development of s alterniflora colonies in an integrative manner 2 methods 2 1 study species spartina alterniflora is a perennial plant species and its population forms dense and near perfect circular colonies over time civille et al 2005 feist and simenstad 2000 marangoni and costa 2012 taylor et al 2004 a colony of s alterniflora contributes to population growth in two ways 1 recruitment of new colonies e g seed reproduction and 2 lateral growth of the colony the empirically estimated recruitment rate of colonies the yearly rate of appearance of new colonies is in range of 0 01 0 02 m 2 yea r 1 grevstad 2005 taylor et al 2004 the recruitment rate exhibits temporal and spatial variations feist and simenstad 2000 grevstad 2005 however for analytical simplicity in the present study we assume a constant rate corresponding to the long term average rate the speed of lateral growth of a colony ranges from 0 5 to 2 m yea r 1 in radius depending on study site feist and simenstad 2000 marangoni and costa 2012 schwarz et al 2011 xiao et al 2010 the diameter of a colony increases linearly with respect to its age feist and simenstad 2000 also for model simplicity we consider inside of a colony is approximately homogeneous this assumption allows us to regard total size of an area occupied by this species as a population size therefore on the present study a proportion of area occupied by the species namely a proportion of the occupied area is equivalent to the population density in the area 2 2 age structured population dynamics model here we introduce a deterministic model for a s alterniflora population that considers lateral growth recruitment mortality and colony overlap fig 1 because of colony overlap the area size occupied by the species is always smaller than or equals to a simple summation of all colony areas the present model estimates the proportion of the occupied area which excludes colony overlap by following two steps 1 calculate area sizes of colonies from their ages and 2 derive the proportion of the occupied area as an expected proportion of occupied area by these colonies to calculate the expected value we assume completely random colony locations i e independently sampled locations from a spatially uniform distribution inside of a habitat in other words the present model is a mean field approximation assuming a homogeneous poisson point process for colony locations besides this model another approach may be to locate new colonies individually in the open area and expand them only when open area is available an example of this is the coalescing colony model shigesada et al 1995 as it locates offspring colonies outside of a parent colony and explicitly tracks collisions between the parent colony and offspring colonies this approach makes the interpretation of variables easier than in the present approach as it is more specific in presenting individual colony growth however the spatial correlations introduced by various colonizations in the open area will complicate mathematical analyses the proposed model has the advantage of mathematical presentation in addition using a relatively simple formulation the present approach enables an effective description of the proportion of the occupied area which is an observable and important value for s alterniflora populations under field conditions the main assumptions of the present model are as follows 1 all colonies increase their radiuses in the same speed 2 mortality rates of all colonies are the same e g colony mortality by a natural or artificial disturbance on certain proportion of area 3 the number of recruitment is proportional to the area size occupied by colonies and 4 the range of seed dispersal is large enough to decouple a location of a parent colony and locations of offspring colonies the last assumption allows us to formulate expected population dynamics independent of colony locations above assumptions allow us to describe population dynamics by an age structured population that can be reduced to ordinary differentiation equations odes see table 1 for variables and parameters of the present model to keep consistency with later mathematical analyses we consider model parameters to be constant of time however we note that the same formulation is available even when the model parameters vary temporally see supplementary materials si 1 let ρ a t be the number of a colony of age a at year t per unit area namely a colony density following the standard method for age structured population models with continuous time and age we define the dynamics of the colony density ρ a t as a following partial differentiation equation pde 1 ρ a t t ρ a t a λ ρ a t with an initial age distribution of colonies ρ a 0 ρ 0 a the first and the second terms of the right hand side represent the aging and natural mortality of colonies respectively the λ is a colony mortality rate which describes the rate of colony dieback let a t be the proportion of area occupied by colonies over a whole survey area i e the proportion of the occupied area 0 a t 1 because colonies can overlap the total area size occupied by these colonies may be smaller than a simple summation of these colony areas therefore in general we may need to calculate the explicit spatial distribution of the colonies however when these colonies distribute randomly in the area we can calculate the expected value of the proportion of the occupied area without considering the actual spatial distribution of the colonies matheron 1974 stoyan and mecke 2005 thompson 1955 under an assumption of completely random locations of colonies we derive the expected proportion of the occupied area a t from a simple summation of colony areas matheron 1974 stoyan and mecke 2005 as follows 2 a t 1 exp π 0 g a 2 ρ a t d a note that g a represents the radius of a colony of age a and π 0 g a 2 ρ a t d a is the summation of all circular colony areas we can interpret above equation as a complement of an expected proportion of an empty area which is calculated as an intersection of outside areas of all colonies the colony density of age 0 colonies ρ 0 t represents the number of colonies recruited at time t by assuming that the number of recruitment is proportional to the current proportion of the occupied area we define the age 0 colony density as 3 ρ 0 t r a t where r represents the number of colony recruitments per unit colony area i e the recruitment rate 2 3 dynamics of the proportion of the occupied area in order to derive a dynamics of the proportion of the occupied area a t we here introduce two auxiliary time courses n t and l t and reduce the age structured population model defined by a pde to a system of odes the new time courses n t and l t represent the expected number of colonies per unit area and the expected total of the colony radii per unit area respectively therefore in this study we refer to n t as a colony density and l t as a total radius the formal definitions of n t and l t are n t 0 ρ a t d a l t 0 g a ρ a t d a recall that the function ρ a t represents the colony density of age a at time t also note that the radius of a colony of age a is defined as g a i e the product of the lateral growth speed and age it is notable that n t and l t include overlaps among all colonies considering overlaps n t and l t are no longer measurable directly although statistical estimations are still available stoyan and mecke 2005 based on eq 1 we first determine the dynamics of 0 g a 2 ρ a t d a which represents the total colony area without considering overlaps and transform it by solving eq 2 see supplemental material si 1 for detail by combining n t l t and a t we derive the following system of odes describing the population dynamics 4 d n t d t r a t λ n t d l t d t g n t λ l t d a t d t 1 a t 2 π g l t λ log 1 a t the right hand side of these equations consists of growth and mortality terms for the population note log 1 a t a t for small a t 0 the factor 1 a t which is the proportion of open area limits the speed of the proportion of the occupied area dynamics the third equation the solutions of these eq 4 can reconstruct the solution of the pde model determined by eq 1 3 based on the assumption of a random spatial distribution of colonies we can also derive the expected total length of colony edges exposed to open mudflats i e the total length of visible edges that we can measure as l t 2 π l t 1 a t stoyan and mecke 2005 with this l x we can transform the time derivative of the total area as d a t d t g l t λ 1 a t log 1 a t the first term of the right hand side g l t clearly indicates a direct contribution of the lateral growth of edges on the area growth 2 4 initial dynamics of a population here we assume that the proportion of the occupied area is initially very small in this case we can generally approximate initial dynamics by the linearized dynamics around zero we linearize eq 4 around zero and let a t be a time course of the proportion of the occupied area of the linearized dynamics the linearized dynamics are solvable and the solution of a t is see supplemental material si 2 for detail 5 a t e λ t mortality g n 0 r f 3 2 1 g t g 2 l 0 g r f 3 1 1 g t a 0 f 3 0 1 g t growth where f 3 0 1 x f 3 1 1 x and f 3 2 1 x are functions termed as generalized hyperbolic functions ungar 1984 the first and second factors of the right hand side represent the contributions of population mortality and growth respectively as the recruitment term reduces to a linear function of a t which represents an assumption of no overlaps the above approximated model is essentially the same as the scattered colony model introduced by shigesada et al 1995 time t of the population growth factor is multiplied by the parameter g 2 π g 2 r 3 which represents the maximum growth rate without mortality in the following analysis the parameter g refers to a growth potential this growth potential g consists of two components 1 a constant 2 π 3 and 2 a parameter g 2 r 3 the parameter component of the growth potential is the geometrical mean of the lateral growth and recruitment of the colonies which represents a mean growth rate of a small population the lateral growth speed g is squared reflecting the fact that a colony grows in a two dimensional space 2 5 initial state for numerical analysis the model accepts any reasonable combination of colony density total radius and proportion of the occupied area as its initial state although some special cases are particularly interesting in this study we assume that a population starts from a single invasion of a few very small s alterniflora colonies which corresponds to an occasional single invasion event by either seeds or rhizome fragments this assumption corresponds to an initial age distribution of ρ 0 a n 0 δ a where n 0 is the initial colony density and δ a is the dirac delta function i e density existing only at age 0 by integrating ρ 0 a we derive corresponding initial values for the reduced odes model n 0 n 0 and l 0 a 0 0 in the following analyses we use the language r r core team 2017 for all of our numerical calculations we use the desolve package soetaert et al 2010 and the lamw package adler 2017 to integrate eq 4 and calculate a special function respectively the r code for the present analysis is available as a supplemental material for online only 3 results 3 1 difference between mortality and growth potential determines asymptotic growth rate initially we describe the dynamics of a small population relating its population growth rate to parameters determining colony dynamics as stated above eq 5 asymptotically converges to exponential growth 6 lim t a t a e g λ t a g n 0 3 r g 2 l 0 g r a 0 considering the asymptotic growth curve g λ is the asymptotic growth rate of a small population therefore a population will become extinct when g λ is negative otherwise it will persist as the growth potential g is the average growth rate of the lateral growth and recruitment this asymptotic growth rate is simply the difference between the average growth rate and the mortality of the colony the parameter a in eq 6 describes how the initial values of the number of colonies n 0 total length of colony edges l 0 and proportion of the occupied area a 0 determine the future dynamics of the proportion of the occupied area when the initial colony density is sufficiently small e g smaller than 10 2 in the default parameters i e one very small colony per 100 m 2 see fig 2 population dynamics exhibit a period of exponential growth that is described by the above asymptotic growth curve fig 2 a smaller value of g results in a slower growth rate fig 2 values of g are 0 36 0 17 and 0 17 for the black red and blue solid curves respectively as we expect from the above analytical results the asymptotic growth rate is the same regardless of the parameter combination as long as we keep the values of g constant fig 2 blue and red curves have the same growth rate the elasticities borgonovo and plischke 2016 caswell 2000 de kroon et al 1986 of the asymptotic growth rate g λ are λ g λ 2 3 g g λ and 1 3 g g λ for colony mortality λ lateral growth speed g and recruitment rate r respectively therefore when the growth potential g is larger than 3 2 of colony mortality changing the lateral growth speed has a larger impact on the asymptotic growth rate than changing the mortality or the recruitment rates by the same proportion we note that the elasticity of colony mortality λ represents the effect of proportional enhancements of the natural colony mortality rather than artificial eradications for which size is independent of natural colony mortality 3 2 lateral growth speed is a major determinant of age distribution development next we describe how a population develops its stable age distribution before growing exponentially i e the dynamics shortlyafter the initial invasion in this period the growth rate of a population approaches g λ fig 2 solid curves converge to dashed exponential curves with corresponding colors while the proportion of the occupied area after the convergence depends on a combination of lateral growth speed g and recruitment rate r fig 2 heights of red and blue curves to extract components of the population growth around the initial time we calculated a taylor series of the terms inside parentheses in eq 5 a 0 2 π l 0 g t π n 0 g 2 t 2 π a 0 g 2 r 3 t 3 π 2 l 0 g 3 r 6 t 4 π 2 n 0 g 4 r 30 t 5 the first term represents the initial proportion of the occupied area and we can interpret second two terms as a total area of tori around initial colonies because we can transform the second and third terms of the above formula 2 π l 0 g t π n 0 g 2 t 2 as 0 π g a g t 2 π g a 2 ρ 0 a d a note integrations of ρ 0 a and g a ρ 0 a by a are n 0 and l 0 respectively these tori represent areas occupied by the lateral growth therefore the total area of these tori is the total area occupied by the lateral growth of the initial colonies until time t with ignoring overlaps among colonies due to the low initial colony density in the same way we can interpret the next three terms as the total area occupied by the direct offspring of the initial colonies which are produced by rate r from the initial colonies the following terms represent the area contributions of descendant colonies that are produced from these new colonies and so on because lateral growth is the only way to increase colony area all growth components including recruitment are associated with the lateral growth speed g on the other hand the recruitment of new colonies adds age 0 i e size 0 colonies and these recruited colonies are delayed in their area growth by lateral growth contribution to the proportion of the occupied area as a result the lateral growth speed has an immediate and major impact on the dynamics of age structure development fig 3 a whereas the recruitment rate has only minor effects owing to the delay in colony growth fig 3b 3 3 ratio between mortality and growth potential determines the equilibrium proportion of the occupied area finally we describe the end state of a population a stable non zero equilibrium exists when the asymptotic growth rate g λ is positive and colony mortality exists λ 0 let a be the stable equilibrium of the proportion of the occupied area a t by solving eq 4 we derive the following analytical form of the stable equilibrium proportion a fig 4 a black solid curve 7 a 1 λ 3 g 3 w 0 g 3 λ 3 e g 3 λ 3 g λ 0 0 otherwise where w 0 x is a principal branch of the lambert w function see supplementary materials si 2 for details when growth potential g is larger than colony mortality λ the extinction of the population a 0 becomes unstable fig 4 red dashed curve note at a limit of λ 0 eq 7 converges to 1 which coincides to an asymptotic value of a t when there is no mortality eq 7 indicates that the ratio between colony mortality λ and growth potential g solely determines an equilibrium proportion of the occupied area fig 4 regardless of the actual combinations of these parameters values as shown in eq 5 the g and λ also determine the asymptotic growth rate of a small population their difference determines the initial increase and their ratio determines the equilibrium proportion of the occupied area 4 discussion in this study we propose a theoretical model for s alterniflora populations and show 1 how two colony growth parameters lateral growth and recruitment rate determine the growth rate of the proportion of the occupied area in a population 2 how these colony growth parameters determine age structure development and 3 how the equilibrium proportion of the occupied area is eventually determined among existing theoretical models we regard the present model as a time continuous mean field approximation of the model proposed by buhle et al 2012 that tracks the yearly dynamics of individual colonies therefore we consider the present model to have a similar level of applicability as their model our analytical formulation allows us to apply further mathematical investigations to determine general response of spartina populations to various combinations of their growth parameters this analytical representation allows us to derive 1 the equilibrium size of the proportion of the occupied area considering overlaps among colonies and 2 the coincidence with the scattered colony model shigesada et al 1995 at the limit of low colony density two growth parameters lateral growth rate and recruitment rate of colonies have been major targets used for controlling s alterniflora populations and monitoring their dynamics as efficient methods for delaying colonial population growth spatially explicit stochastic models have indicated the eradication of small colonies e g buhle et al 2012 taylor and hastings 2004 and colonies on the outer edges of population boundaries e g grevstad 2005 murphy et al 2013 the removal of small colonies having longer edges compared with their area size and colonies on the boundaries which are likely to be isolated from the main portion of the population reduces the amount of edges exposed to open mudflats thus reduces future area growth the present formulation clearly relates area growth and the lateral growth of edges and the results indicate the importance of lateral growth from two perspectives 1 newly recruited colonies are small and must grow laterally to increase their area before producing offspring colonies and 2 the effect of lateral growth is enhanced by its square because the habitat is two dimensional however some recent studies have suggested control strategies that aim to prevent recruitment rather than reduction of lateral growth liu et al 2014 proposed complete eradication of recruitment which virtually halts population growth the local sensitivity analysis of yang et al 2014 implies that when the effect of a strategy is independent of the current size of its target parameter the prevention of recruitment will be a suitable option for a population with a low recruitment rate on the other hand some strategies adjust their target parameters on a proportional scale e g removing a certain proportion of seedling germinations recruitments or tiller productions lateral growth by physical or chemical treatments for these strategies elasticity borgonovo and plischke 2016 caswell 2000 de kroon et al 1986 seems to be a more suitable measure of their efficacy rather than a naïve application of sensitivities our results support an existing recommendation that prioritizes the reduction of edge growth to control recruitment buhle et al 2012 grevstad 2005 murphy et al 2013 taylor and hastings 2004 the above recommendation discrepancies which are derived from sensitivity and elasticity analyses suggest to us the importance of knowing how control strategies affect demographic parameters abiotic environmental factors e g tidal currents and wave intensity control the survival and lateral growth of s alterniflora colonies schwarz et al 2011 in addition empirically observed site specific variations in growth parameters feist and simenstad 2000 marangoni and costa 2012 schwarz et al 2011 xiao et al 2010 suggest an in situ dependence of colony expansion under field conditions the present model suggests that the growth potential as more simply represented by the product of the recruitment rate and the square of the lateral growth speed provides a more feasible approach for aligning the parameters of different ecological characteristics into a single framework the current evaluation of growth potential implicitly takes both short term and long term dynamics into account based on the fact that both the asymptotic growth rate and the equilibrium proportion of the occupied area concurrently depend on the growth potential values although we keep the present model as simple as possible to promote analytical investigation this simplicity does not limit its extensibility without any modifications the present model allows temporal variations for model parameters e g the lateral growth speed determined by climatic changes marangoni and costa 2012 although the present model does not allow explicit age dependencies of parameters by breaking the lifetime of a colony into stages e g large mortality rates of colonies smaller than a threshold size schwarz et al 2011 we can apply the present model for each stage with different sets of parameter values and combine them to model their entire lifetime in this paper we propose an age structured population model of s alterniflora population dynamics the model describes the population dynamics as a consequence of three basic mechanisms lateral growth of a colony recruitment of new colonies and mortality of a colony three model parameters correspond to each of these mechanisms allowing direct interpretations of model responses based on the mechanisms these basic mechanisms are relatively general therefore this model could feasibly be applied to a wide range of population dynamics scenarios where size growth and spatial occupation are major factors acknowledgments this work was supported by

25117,smooth cordgrass spartina alterniflora is a perennial grass species that forms distinctive colonies on mudflats such colonies can increase their size by expanding clonally to surrounding open mudflats and their number by establishing new colonies on far away from the original colonies either by sexual reproduction or rhizome fragmentation in this work we aimed to link colony dynamics mechanisms lateral growth and recruitment to reproduce the overall population dynamics of spartina alterniflora in an integrative manner the proposed model describes a population as a collection of age structured colonies randomly distributed in a habitat area by applying a mean field approach for spatial dimensions we derive dynamics of how the expected proportion of an area occupied by these colonies would disperse over time we derive a parameter describing the contribution of lateral growth and recruitment to population i e the growth potential this growth potential is proportional to the geometrical mean of the lateral growth speed and recruitment rate representing the average growth rate including these two mechanisms moreover we show that lateral growth rather than recruitment addresses transitional dynamics of stable age structure developments the ratio between colony mortality and growth potential determines the equilibrium proportion of area occupied by these colonies the application of this model to s alterniflora population dynamics would be feasible across a wide range of populations determined by the spatial occupations of growing colonies keywords perennial plant population population dynamics age structured population poisson point process spatially implicit model 1 introduction we present a theoretical model for investigating the population dynamics of spartina alterniflora smooth cordgrass being one of 14 spartina species s alterniflora forms dense clonal colonies on open mudflats an invasion of this species can transform open mudflats into dense meadows and can alter such ecosystems e g by reducing the diversity of shorebirds and fish callaway and josselyn 1992 neira et al 2005 wang et al 2008 as a result despite an initial expectation for managing seashores using s alterniflora its negative ecological impacts in mudflat environments now overshadow its benefit adams et al 2012 an et al 2007 wang et al 2008 a population of s alterniflora on a mudflat consists of many circular colonies of various sizes civille et al 2005 feist and simenstad 2000 marangoni and costa 2012 taylor et al 2004 this species recruits new colonies either by seed reproduction or vegetative fragmentation with their size increased by lateral clonal growth bush 2002 daehler and strong 1994 colonies eventually grow large enough to overlap merging into a single large colony these two basic mechanisms i e the recruitment of new colonies and the lateral growth of existing colonies determine colony dynamics in an integrative manner including spatial overlaps among colonies therefore it is important to understand how these basic mechanisms determine the dynamics of a colonial population in relation to the growth mechanisms and area limitation because of its high invasive nature and large impact on native mudflat ecosystems s alterniflora has been the subject of many theoretical studies these studies have proposed theoretical models that range from spatially explicit models using numerical computations ge et al 2015 grevstad 2005 huang et al 2008 liu et al 2014 murphy et al 2013 murphy and johnson 2015 taylor et al 2004 to models

2008 theoretical studies comparing control strategies on growth factors have often indicated larger effects for strategies that focus on open edges of clonal colonies rather than on colony recruitments buhle et al 2012 grevstad 2005 taylor and hastings 2004 however some recent studies have indicated the opposite liu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 as the recommendations from these studies

the third equation the solutions of these eq 4 can reconstruct the solution of the pde model determined by eq 1 3 based on the assumption of a random spatial distribution of colonies we can also derive the expected total length of colony edges exposed to open mudflats i e the total length of visible edges that we can measure as l t 2 π l t 1 a t stoyan and mecke 2005 with this l x we can transform the time derivative of the total area as d a t d t g l t λ 1 a t log 1 a t the first term of the right hand side g l t clearly indicates a direct contribution of the lateral growth of edges on the area growth 2 4 initial dynamics of a population here we assume that the proportion of the occupied area is initially very small in this case we can generally approximate initial dynamics by the linearized dynamics around zero we linearize eq 4 around zero and let a t be a time course of the proportion of the occupied area of the linearized dynamics the linearized dynamics are solvable and the solution of a t is see supplemental material si 2 for detail 5 a t e λ t mortality g n 0 r f 3 2 1 g t g 2 l 0 g r f 3 1 1 g t a 0 f 3 0 1 g t growth where f 3 0 1 x f 3 1 1 x and f 3 2 1 x are functions termed as generalized hyperbolic functions ungar 1984 the first and second factors of the right hand side represent the contributions of population mortality and growth respectively as the recruitment term reduces to a linear function of a t which represents an assumption of no overlaps the above approximated model is essentially the same as the scattered colony model introduced by shigesada et al 1995 time t of the population growth factor is multiplied by the parameter g 2 π g 2 r 3 which represents the maximum growth rate without mortality in the following analysis the parameter g refers to a growth potential this growth potential g consists of two components 1 a constant 2 π 3 and 2 a parameter g 2 r 3 the parameter component of the growth potential is the geometrical mean of the lateral growth and recruitment of the colonies which represents a mean growth rate of a small population the lateral growth speed g is squared reflecting the fact that a colony grows in a two dimensional space 2 5 initial state for numerical analysis the model accepts any reasonable combination of colony density total radius and proportion of the occupied area as its initial state although some special cases are particularly interesting in this study we assume that a population starts from a single invasion of a few very small s alterniflora colonies which corresponds to an occasional single invasion event by either seeds or rhizome fragments this assumption corresponds to an initial age distribution of ρ 0 a n 0 δ a where n 0 is the initial colony density and δ a is the dirac delta function i e density existing only at age 0 by integrating ρ 0 a we derive corresponding initial values for the reduced odes model n 0 n 0 and l 0 a 0 0 in the following analyses we use the language r r core team 2017 for all of our numerical calculations we use the desolve package soetaert et al 2010 and the lamw package adler 2017 to integrate eq 4 and calculate a special function respectively the r code for the present analysis is available as a supplemental material for online only 3 results 3 1 difference between mortality and growth potential determines asymptotic growth rate initially we describe the dynamics of a small population relating its population growth rate to parameters determining colony dynamics as stated above eq 5 asymptotically converges to exponential growth 6 lim t a t a e g λ t a g n 0 3 r g 2 l 0 g r a 0 considering the asymptotic growth curve g λ is the asymptotic growth rate of a small population therefore a population will become extinct when g λ is negative otherwise it will persist as the growth potential g is the average growth rate of the lateral growth and recruitment this asymptotic growth rate is simply the difference between the average growth rate and the mortality of the colony the parameter a in eq 6 describes how the initial values of the number of colonies n 0 total length of colony edges l 0 and proportion of the occupied area a 0 determine the future dynamics of the proportion of the occupied area when the initial colony density is sufficiently small e g smaller than 10 2 in the default parameters i e one very small colony per 100 m 2 see fig 2 population dynamics exhibit a period of exponential growth that is described by the above asymptotic growth curve fig 2 a smaller value of g results in a slower growth rate fig 2 values of g are 0 36 0 17 and 0 17 for the black red and blue solid curves respectively as we expect from the above analytical results the asymptotic growth rate is the same regardless of the parameter combination as long as we keep the values of g constant fig 2 blue and red curves have the same growth rate the elasticities borgonovo and plischke 2016 caswell 2000 de kroon et al 1986 of the asymptotic growth rate g λ are λ g λ 2 3 g g λ and 1 3 g g λ for colony mortality λ lateral growth speed g and recruitment rate r respectively therefore when the growth potential g is larger than 3 2 of colony mortality changing the lateral growth speed has a larger impact on the asymptotic growth rate than changing the mortality or the recruitment rates by the same proportion we note that the elasticity of colony mortality λ represents the effect of proportional enhancements of the natural colony mortality rather than artificial eradications for which size is independent of natural colony mortality 3 2 lateral growth speed is a major determinant of age distribution development next we describe how a population develops its stable age distribution before growing exponentially i e the dynamics shortlyafter the initial invasion in this period the growth rate of a population approaches g λ fig 2 solid curves converge to dashed exponential curves with corresponding colors while the proportion of the occupied area after the convergence depends on a combination of lateral growth speed g and recruitment rate r fig 2 heights of red and blue curves to extract components of the population growth around the initial time we calculated a taylor series of the terms inside parentheses in eq 5 a 0 2 π l 0 g t π n 0 g 2 t 2 π a 0 g 2 r 3 t 3 π 2 l 0 g 3 r 6 t 4 π 2 n 0 g 4 r 30 t 5 the first term represents the initial proportion of the occupied area and we can interpret second two terms as a total area of tori around initial colonies because we can transform the second and third terms of the above formula 2 π l 0 g t π n 0 g 2 t 2 as 0 π g a g t 2 π g a 2 ρ 0 a d a note integrations of ρ 0 a and g a ρ 0 a by a are n 0 and l 0 respectively these tori represent areas occupied by the lateral growth therefore the total area of these tori is the total area occupied by the lateral growth of the initial colonies until time t with ignoring overlaps among colonies due to the low initial colony density in the same way we can interpret the next three terms as the total area occupied by the direct offspring of the initial colonies which are produced by rate r from the initial colonies the following terms represent the area contributions of descendant colonies that are produced from these new colonies and so on because lateral growth is the only way to increase colony area all growth components including recruitment are associated with the lateral growth speed g on the other hand the recruitment of new colonies adds age 0 i e size 0 colonies and these recruited colonies are delayed in their area growth by lateral growth contribution to the proportion of the occupied area as a result the lateral growth speed has an immediate and major impact on the dynamics of age structure development fig 3 a whereas the recruitment rate has only minor effects owing to the delay in colony growth fig 3b 3 3 ratio between mortality and growth potential determines the equilibrium proportion of the occupied area finally we describe the end state of a population a stable non zero equilibrium exists when the asymptotic growth rate g λ is positive and colony mortality exists λ 0 let a be the stable equilibrium of the proportion of the occupied area a t by solving eq 4 we derive the following analytical form of the stable equilibrium proportion a fig 4 a black solid curve 7 a 1 λ 3 g 3 w 0 g 3 λ 3 e g 3 λ 3 g λ 0 0 otherwise where w 0 x is a principal branch of the lambert w function see supplementary materials si 2 for details when growth potential g is larger than colony mortality λ the extinction of the population a 0 becomes unstable fig 4 red dashed curve note at a limit of λ 0 eq 7 converges to 1 which coincides to an asymptotic value of a t when there is no mortality eq 7 indicates that the ratio between colony mortality λ and growth potential g solely determines an equilibrium proportion of the occupied area fig 4 regardless of the actual combinations of these parameters values as shown in eq 5 the g and λ also determine the asymptotic growth rate of a small population their difference determines the initial increase and their ratio determines the equilibrium proportion of the occupied area 4 discussion in this study we propose a theoretical model for s alterniflora populations and show 1 how two colony growth parameters lateral growth and recruitment rate determine the growth rate of the proportion of the occupied area in a population 2 how these colony growth parameters determine age structure development and 3 how the equilibrium proportion of the occupied area is eventually determined among existing theoretical models we regard the present model as a time continuous mean field approximation of the model proposed by buhle et al 2012 that tracks the yearly dynamics of individual colonies therefore we consider the present model to have a similar level of applicability as their model our analytical formulation allows us to apply further mathematical investigations to determine general response of spartina populations to various combinations of their growth parameters this analytical representation allows us to derive 1 the equilibrium size of the proportion of the occupied area considering overlaps among colonies and 2 the coincidence with the scattered colony model shigesada et al 1995 at the limit of low colony density two growth parameters lateral growth rate and recruitment rate of colonies have been major targets used for controlling s alterniflora populations and monitoring their dynamics as efficient methods for delaying colonial population growth spatially explicit stochastic models have indicated the eradication of small colonies e g buhle et al 2012 taylor and hastings 2004 and colonies on the outer edges of population boundaries e g grevstad 2005 murphy et al 2013 the removal of small colonies having longer edges compared with their area size and colonies on the boundaries which are likely to be isolated from the main portion of the population reduces the amount of edges exposed to open mudflats thus reduces future area growth the present formulation clearly relates area growth and the lateral growth of edges and the results indicate the importance of lateral growth from two perspectives 1 newly recruited colonies are small and must grow laterally to increase their area before producing offspring colonies and 2 the effect of lateral growth is enhanced by its square because the habitat is two dimensional however some recent studies have suggested control strategies that aim to prevent recruitment rather than reduction of lateral growth liu et al 2014 proposed complete eradication of recruitment which virtually halts population growth the local sensitivity analysis of yang et al 2014 implies that when the effect of a strategy is independent of the current size of its target parameter the prevention of recruitment will be a suitable option for a population with a low recruitment rate on the other hand some strategies adjust their target parameters on a proportional scale e g removing a certain proportion of seedling germinations recruitments or tiller productions lateral growth by physical or chemical treatments for these strategies elasticity borgonovo and plischke 2016 caswell 2000 de kroon et al 1986 seems to be a more suitable measure of their efficacy rather than a naïve application of sensitivities our results support an existing recommendation that prioritizes the reduction of edge growth to control recruitment buhle et al 2012 grevstad 2005 murphy et al 2013 taylor and hastings 2004 the above recommendation discrepancies which are derived from sensitivity and elasticity analyses suggest to us the importance of knowing how control strategies affect demographic parameters abiotic environmental factors e g tidal currents and wave intensity control the survival and lateral growth of s alterniflora colonies schwarz et al 2011 in addition empirically observed site specific variations in growth parameters feist and simenstad 2000 marangoni and costa 2012 schwarz et al 2011 xiao et al 2010 suggest an in situ dependence of colony expansion under field conditions the present model suggests that the growth potential as more simply represented by the product of the recruitment rate and the square of the lateral growth speed provides a more feasible approach for aligning the parameters of different ecological characteristics into a single framework the current evaluation of growth potential implicitly takes both short term and long term dynamics into account based on the fact that both the asymptotic growth rate and the equilibrium proportion of the occupied area concurrently depend on the growth potential values although we keep the present model as simple as possible to promote analytical investigation this simplicity does not limit its extensibility without any modifications the present model allows temporal variations for model parameters e g the lateral growth speed determined by climatic changes marangoni and costa 2012 although the present model does not allow explicit age dependencies of parameters by breaking the lifetime of a colony into stages e g large mortality rates of colonies smaller than a threshold size schwarz et al 2011 we can apply the present model for each stage with different sets of parameter values and combine them to model their entire lifetime in this paper we propose an age structured population model of s alterniflora population dynamics the model describes the population dynamics as a consequence of three basic mechanisms lateral growth of a colony recruitment of new colonies and mortality of a colony three model parameters correspond to each of these mechanisms allowing direct interpretations of model responses based on the mechanisms these basic mechanisms are relatively general therefore this model could feasibly be applied to a wide range of population dynamics scenarios where size growth and spatial occupation are major factors acknowledgments this work was supported by

25118,forests are among the most important land ecosystems both in term of their contribution to the global carbon cycle and for their prominence in hosting large biodiversity under a changing world both in terms of land use and climate scenarios it is pivotal to understand the matter and energy flows in complex ecosystems such as forests in order to infer potential relationships at different levels i e from soil to bird community within the forest stands in this context soil organic matter is main source of carbon and energy for heterotrophic soil organisms which are a main component of the whole food web all the way up to bird communities even though many studies have investigated factors affecting c cycle and bird communities in forest ecosystems separately an integrated approach that links soil to bird community was never attempted accordingly we have used an innovative two block partial least squares analysis to investigate patterns of covariance between soil and nesting bird communities in a relatively small wooded area surrounded by the urban area of naples southern italy our research revealed that in spite of the small extent and the surrounding urban context the area of the astroni hosts a substantial c stock and has a diversified bird nesting community the abundance of species such as blue tit jay green woodpecker and great tit had a direct covariance with c stock in litter while sampling sites that were characterized by greater c stocks in the soil and higher microbial activity were correlated with abundance of other bird species most noticeably short toed treecreeper and blackbird despite the limited extent of our research area our study showed for the first time patterns of covariance between some forest species and different soil variables linking forest ecological compartments whose connections are not immediately detectable and that could open new perspectives in land use management both in terms of c stock and biodiversity evaluations keywords astroni blue tit carbon stocks holm oak hornbeam short toed treecreeper 1 introduction among the different land uses forests cover about 30 of the earth s surface and provide several ecosystem services whose importance is generally recognized gamfeldt et al 2013 within these ecosystem services we can include the fundamental role that forests play in the global carbon cycle and their importance for biodiversity in detail through the exchanges with the atmosphere by means of photosynthesis and respiration forests represent the most important c sink both in the biomass and in the organic matter present above and belowground ipcc 2013 additionally forests are of crucial importance for biodiversity with over 50 of the known terrestrial species found in the forests of the globe scbd 2001 the build up of c in the forests depends on the balance between primary productivity and the rate of decomposition of the plant residue current climate change can profoundly alter the balance between productivity and decay with relevant effects on soil organic matter som and forests zak et al 2011 in the mediterranean region such processes could result even in larger extent because climate changes are expected to be particularly severe giorgi and lionello 2008 accordingly while it is possible that climate change can transform some forests from sinks to sources of co2 meier and leuschner 2010 it is equally true that important changes are to be expected in numerous forest species with associated serious risks of biodiversity loss and changes in communities within few decades or at most centuries lindner et al 2010 forest soils rich in organic matter host diversified communities constituted by decomposers i e fungi and bacteria and consumers including a large number of soil fauna along the food web if present the abundance of decaying wood favours the development of rich communities to which birds are associated characterized by both generalist and highly specialized species thus there is a close relationship between som and soil biological activity because som is the main source of carbon and energy for heterotrophic soil organisms which are a main component of the whole food web all the way up to bird communities in particular birds have been widely studied as biological indicators in different ecosystems especially in forest ecosystems balestrieri et al 2015 in comparison with other animal groups bird communities are relatively simple to survey balestrieri et al 2017 and can provide substantial information on forest patchiness basile et al 2016 structure balestrieri et al 2015 or habitat conservation valerio et al 2016 although there is plenty of studies that analyse factors affecting c cycle and bird communities in forest ecosystems an integrated approach that links soil to bird community was never attempted nevertheless there is a growing interest and need in connecting ecosystem compartments on different trophic levels e g from producers to decomposers and or from detritivores to birds especially under a changing climate that might alter species distribution and carbon stocks simultaneously innangi et al 2015 moreover if connections between widespread or specialized bird forest species and soil c stock should be found a focused monitoring of bird species might be used in the future for inferring increased or decreased soil organic matter quantity and quality accordingly we have conducted both soil and bird community surveys in a relatively small wooded area inside the urban area of naples italy the area is composed by two forest ecosystems a holm oak wood and a mixed wood surrounded by a densely inhabited area we have used an innovative two block partial least squares 2b pls analysis to investigate patterns of covariance between several variables related to soil and nesting bird communities our work aimed to a investigate differences between the ecosystems in terms of forest structure soil and bird communities b examine the covariance between bird species and soil related variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the research was carried out within the astroni crater world wildlife fund wwf reserve in the volcanic area of campi flegrei in the urban area naples italy isaia et al 2004 the reserve 247 ha develops inside the caldera of an extinct volcano with a maximum elevation of 255 m a s l displaying an elliptical shape 2 1 6 km the inner part of the crater shows a deep depression that hosts a lake where a minimum elevation of 9 m a s l is reached in the central part of the crater nearby the larger lake there are two additional small lakes and three hills that stand above the bottom at 45 74 and 82 m a s l respectively fig 1 the peculiar conformation of the area determines a high level of humidity and a thermal inversion in the crater naples naples province 2007 therefore the lower part of the crater hosts a mesophilous vegetation mixed wood characterized by the dominance of hornbeams carpinus betulus l and ostrya carpinifolia scop and ash fraxinus ornus l along with oaks quercus petrea matt liebl q robur l and some q ilex l chestnuts castanea sativa mill elms ulmus minor mill as well as introduced species such as black locust robinia pseudoacacia l red oak q rubra l and canadian poplar populus deltoides w bartram ex marshall in the higher parts i e in the crater s rim and in the internal hills the vegetation is a holm oak wood q ilex with few other tree species such as ash and tree heath erica arborea l in small areas on the ridges and outside the crater a mediterranean maquis is found around the lakes the vegetation is characterized by swamp reeds phragmites australis cav trin ex steud rushes juncus effusus l and reedmace typha latifolia l while in the lakes myriophyllum spicatum l and ceratophyllum demersum l are dominant motti and ricciardi 2005 2 2 sampling sites in the whole crater we digitized the area of holm oak wood 127 ha and the area of mixed wood 104 ha in order to define the two main ecosystems in each area 10 sampling sites at least 200 m apart from each other were chosen randomly in a gis environment fig 2 table 1 summarizes the geographical and topographic characteristics of the sampling points samplings and surveys were conducted between april and october 2016 before the wildfires that heavily damaged the reserve in july 2017 2 3 estimation of carbon stocks in the phytomass and in the deadwood at each sampling site the forest structure was assessed using the protocol of the national inventory of forests and forest carbon sinks www infc it briefly in a circular surface with a radius of 13 m we have determined a tree species c diameter at breast height dbh on all specimens with diameter 5 cm c the presence size and quality of deadwood tree heights were obtained by gompertz regression based on hulshof et al 2015 in detail heights in meters y were estimated according to the following models considering x as the dbh in decimeters g y m n o s p e r m s y 25 3 e 2 1 e 0 93 x e v e r g r e e n a n g i o s p e r m s y 25 5 e 2 0 e 0 93 x d e c i d u o u s a n g i o s p e r m s y 24 8 e 1 9 e 0 94 x we have computed tree volume and phytomass according to tabacchi et al 2011 deadwood was also assessed subjectively for its degree of decomposition from 0 fresh wood to 4 highly decomposed wood the density was evaluated considering a gradient as reported in mäkipää and linkosalo 2011 and was evaluated in 0 744 kg dm3 for fresh wood and 0 279 kg dm3 for highly decomposed wood thus we have estimated carbon stocks in the biomass and in the deadwood considering c as 50 of the overall biomass and necromass brown 2002 2 4 soil and litter samplings along with biological and chemical measurements at each site 2 samples of litter were taken using a 20 cm 20 cm square metal and 2 soil cores in the 0 5 and 5 10 cm layers using a steel cylinder of 5 5 cm in diameter and 5 cm in length innangi et al 2017 for simplicity we will refer to the 0 5 cm layer as topsoil and to the 5 10 cm as subsoil respectively in the laboratory litter was weighed before and after its separation into 4 fractions i e leaf litter wood acorns and seeds and other materials e g bark the soil samples were sieved with 2 mm mesh sieves the gravel free dry mass of soil was used to compute bulk density throop et al 2012 an aliquot of both leaf litter and soil was dried to constant weight at 75 c and powered for subsequent analysis of organic matter and cellulose contents while a second aliquot was stored at 80 c for the determination of the fluorescein diacetate hydrolase activity organic matter content was determined by loss on ignition method soil samples were exposed at a temperature of 375 c for 16 h while leaf litter was incinerated at 550 c for 4 h the litter fractions of wood acorns and seeds and other materials were exposed at 650 c for 16 h the c content of both litter and soil was evaluated by halving som values pribyl 2010 cellulose content in litter and soil was determined using the experimental spectrophotometric method described by danise et al 2018 stocks of c and cellulose in both litter and soil were computed according to innangi et al 2015 fluorescein diacetate hydrolase fdah activity was determined according to green et al 2006 2 5 nesting bird community at each sampling site we employed temporally replicated point counts balestrieri et al 2017 in details surveys were carried out between 5 30 and 7 30 a m in all locations with three replicates between may and june during breeding season the central point of each plot was reached and the surveyor remained still for 5 min in order to allow birds to become accustomed to his her presence subsequently birds present in the area were recognized and recorded for 5 min according to their calls or songs with the aid of visual recognition when possible we used unrestricted radius counts given that in dense forest accurate measurements of distance are difficult to obtain nevertheless double counts of the same individuals from adjacent survey points are unlikely given the large distance between sampling points and the short duration of every count balestrieri et al 2017 results were expressed as individuals per plot birds whose relative abundance was less than 2 5 in both ecosystems were considered occasional or rare crisp and southward 1958 2 6 statistics species diversity for forest stands and bird communities was evaluated as shannon wiener diversity index h that is computed as h i 1 s n i ln n i where ni is the proportion of the individuals from the ith species to the overall individuals n of the s species for bird community we also reported dominance index d i 1 s n i 2 and evenness eh s all variables were inspected for outliers and for normality all data are represented as mean standard error of the mean differences between ecosystems i e holm oak wood vs mixed wood and among layers were tested by one way or two way analysis of variance anova transforming variables with box cox transformation with optimal lambda to ensure normality and homogeneity of variances osborne 2010 patterns of covariance between bird nesting community and forest soil variables were tested using two block partial least squares 2b pls this statistical technique belongs to the broader range of partial least square regression which is particularly apt to analyze a large array of related predictor variables with a sample size not as large as the number of independent variables carrascal et al 2009 in summary given two matrixes with different variables but same number of observations 2b pls will construct pairs of variables as linear combinations of the variables within each of the two sets which are constructed so that the new variables account for as much as possible of the covariation between the two original sets of variables innangi et al 2018 rohlf and corti 2000 such statistical technique was recently applied to forest ecosystems to investigate litter to topsoil chemical variations innangi et al 2017 as well as investigating simultaneous and interacting changes in chemical variables extracellular enzyme activities and soil fauna innangi et al 2018 the r packages ggplot2 and plsdepot were used to perform the analyses 3 results 3 1 main forest structure a total of 464 and 454 living trees were measured in the holm oak wood and in the mixed wood respectively the results of the tree diversity survey confirmed that in the holm oak wood holm oak was 70 of all trees followed by ash tree heath and black locust mixed wood showed a greater species diversity with a codominance of hornbeam carpinus betulus and ash along with other species such as acer campestre l ostrya carpinifolia quercus petraea q robur robinia pseudoacacia and q ilex as well the latter accounting for 12 of the total trees in the mixed wood shannon wiener diversity index was 0 5 0 3 in holm oak wood and 1 4 0 4 in the mixed wood both holm oak and mixed woods were comparable in terms of dbh and tree height while tree density and volume were higher in mixed wood although differences were not significant table 2 3 2 carbon stocks carbon stocks fig 3 did not statistically differ between the ecosystems two way anova f value 3 32 p value 0 072 while they differed among the layers two way anova f value 96 86 p value 0 001 accordingly the largest c stock was found in the phytomass with approximately 100 mg c ha in both holm oak and mixed woods fig 3 large c stocks were found also in subsoil with higher values in mixed wood fig 3 the c stocks of deadwood and topsoil were comparable whereas litter held the lowest c stock fig 3 considering the whole extension of the two ecosystems in the crater the overall estimates of c stocks were of 24 451 9650 mg c in the holm oak wood and 22 861 6455 in the mixed wood table 3 3 3 cellulose stocks cellulose stocks in litter topsoil and subsoil fig 4 did not statistically differ between the ecosystems two way anova f value 0 05 p value 0 820 by contrast they differed among the layers two way anova f value 44 99 p value 0 001 larger cellulose stocks were found in the topsoil as compared to the subsoil for both the woods fig 4 cellulose stock in leaf litter were lowest in mixed wood while they were comparable to subsoil in holm oak wood 3 4 fluorescein diacetate hydrolase activity fdah the fdah activity fig 5 significantly differed both between the ecosystems two way anova f value 9 71 p value 0 003 and among layers two way anova f value 326 73 p value 0 001 the activity was approximately 3 folds higher in litter compared to both layers of soil there was a shaper difference in topsoil and subsoil in holm oak wood whereas fdah in the mixed wood was more overlapping 3 5 bird nesting community in the two ecosystems a grand total of 18 species of nesting birds were ascertained table 4 a number of species i e common buzzard buteo buteo l common chiffchaff phylloscopus collybita l european serin serinus serinus l subalpine warbler sylvia cantillans pallas peregrine falcon falco peregrinus tunstall european bee eater merops apiaster l common raven corvus corax l and hooded crow corvus cornix l were seen or recorded sporadically during the field surveys but were not considered as nesting in any of the surveyed forest plots in the holm oak wood wood pigeon columba palumbus l blackcap sylvia atricapilla l blackbird turdus merula l and blue tit cyanistes caeruleus l were the most abundant species of the 16 species found in this ecosystem chaffinch fringilla coelebs l and jay garrulus glandarius l were both present at 3 8 of the total for holm oak wood while short toed treecreeper certhia brachydactyla brehm great spotted woodpecker dendrocopos major l and firecrest regulus ignicapilla temminck were below the threshold of 2 5 of the total abundance in comparison the mixed wood s most abundant species was wood pigeon followed by blackbird and wren troglodytes troglodytes l of the 15 species recorded in the mixed wood only jay was below the threshold of 2 5 of the total individuals while robin erithacus rubecula l wryneck jynx torquilla l cetti s warbler cettia cetti temminck magpie pica pica l long tailed tit aegithalos caudatus l and sardinian warbler sylvia melanocephala gmelin were considered occasional or rare in the crater each having an abundance 2 5 in both ecosystems in terms of species diversity the ecosystems were comparable both in terms of dominance d 0 10 and shannon wiener diversity index h 2 33 while evenness was slightly higher in the mixed wood compared to the holm oak wood 0 68 vs 0 64 respectively 3 6 two block partial least squares explained variance in axis 1 for block 1 bird community was 19 while block 2 soil variables explained 22 of total variance fig 6 a gradient can be seen from bottom left quadrant where all observations belong to holm oak wood to the top right quadrant where most observations derive from mixed wood although holm oak wood points are present as well on block 1 a neat separation of two groups of species can be seen accordingly blue tit jay blackcap green woodpecker and great tit are inversely correlated with short toed treecreeper blackbird firecrest chaffinch and wren great spotted woodpecker and wood pigeon explained almost no variance at all as for block 2 variables are neatly separated as well a group of four variables i e c and cellulose stocks in litter cellulose stock in subsoil and c stock in deadwood can be seen as inversely correlated with all the others with c stocks in the top and subsoil as the ivariables with the highest correlation coefficient with axis 1 thus in both blocks of 2b pls if we consider only the variables with the highest absolute values of the correlation coefficients with axis 1 i we can see that the abundance of blue tit can be seen as positively correlated to c stock in litter and inversely correlated with c stock in the subsoil while the opposite was true for short toed treecreeper 4 discussion our survey in the astroni crater confirmed that albeit surrounded by one of the largest and heavily inhabited city of europe there are many forest species that indicate a good degree of naturalness motti and ricciardi 2005 the overall tree vegetation was similar to previous surveys in the past cavara 1910 motti and ricciardi 2005 naples province 2007 nevertheless some peculiarity in forest structure emerged from our survey the structural complexity of a forest includes several variables e g tree density spatial arrangement size and height distribution and biodiversity mcelhinny et al 2005 physical environmental factors can lead to changes in forest structure and biodiversity structuring sylvan animal communities as well tanabe et al 2001 consequently a positive correlation between biodiversity and complexity of structural components within an ecosystem is usually found mac nally et al 2001 given the comparatively small area of the crater our estimates for carbon stocks in the two ecosystems can be considered highly indicative accurate estimates of forest biomass are pivotal both for commercial uses and for scientific studies for assessing the contribution of changes in forest lands to the global c cycle basuki et al 2009 henry et al 2010 accordingly the estimation of the above ground biomass is becoming increasingly important chave et al 2005 when compared to the data reported by the italian national inventory of forests and forest carbon sinks gasparini and tabacchi 2011 for region campania where astroni is located conspicuous differences emerge in terms of tree numerical density nevertheless it is important to highlight that given its peculiar history climate and context the astroni crater can hardly be compared to other italian forest ecosystems accordingly holm oak forests of campania show mean numerical density of 914 in ha and mean volume of 51 1 m3 ha while in hornbeam forests comparable to our mixed wood the numerical density reported is 2213 9 in ha and the volume equal to 71 m3 ha thus our tree density is remarkably lower but the tree volume is higher gorham 1979 showed that stands of single stemmed plants follow a simple rule relating shoot dry weight and standing crop to density thus an inverse relationship between the numerical density of the trees and the volume can explain differences between the astroni and the data from the national inventory this could be explained by the greater supply of light and nutrient supply of plants present in lower density forests the higher or lower volume of the plants also reflects on the biomass and consequently on the amount of stored carbon the world s forests store more than 650 billion tonnes of carbon 44 in the biomass 11 in deadwood and litter and 45 in the soil fao 2010 data that are proportionally confirmed in our findings despite the comparatively small dimensions of the crater the c stocks in the various forest compartments are considerable in fact whereas the litter and subsoil of both stands are in line with the national forest inventory data with holm oak and hornbeam forests of the campania region showing 2 2 and 1 1 mg c ha in the litter and 43 2 and 52 2 mg c ha in the subsoil respectively gasparini and tabacchi 2011 stocks in the other sectors are significantly higher accordingly holm oak and hornbeam forests of the campania region hold 22 1 and 21 4 mg c ha in the phytomass and 2 7 and 1 8 mg c ha in the topsoil respectively gasparini and tabacchi 2011 which are sensibly smaller than our findings carbon stock in the astroni soil in the first 0 5 cm is not too smaller than important forest ecosystems such as beech forests which host an average of 30 mg c ha in the topsoil innangi et al 2015 considering the sum of c stock in both topsoil and subsoil in the astroni we get a mean value of 52 mg c ha for holm oak wood and 67 mg c ha for mixed wood respectively which can be compared both to beech forests curcio et al 2017 and oak and even some coniferous forests schulp and nabuurs 2008 the c stocks in litter and soil also showed good quality along with quantity given their content in cellulose cellulose was recently shown as being a good indicator of humic substances danise et al 2018 thus indicating stable labile ratio of c into litter and soil despite the low amount of data available for cellulose in litter and soil for forest ecosystems if we sum the amount of cellulose in the litter and topsoil of the astroni we get mean values of 7 1 mg cell ha and 7 3 mg cell ha for holm oak and mixed wood respectively which are larger than what was found in an italian alder forest ecosystem where conversely c stock was higher innangi et al 2017 as for fdah this enzyme has been usually considered as a good indicator of microbial biomass in soils alarcón gutiérrez et al 2009 rao et al 2014 the activity decreased from litter to soil which is consistent with general findings of microbial activity and biomass in forest soils alarcón gutiérrez et al 2009 fioretto et al 2018 our results are in line with previous research green et al 2006 muscolo et al 2014 and testify high microbial presence and activity in the two studied ecosystems a former check list for nesting birds inside the astroni reported 44 species wwf italy 2008 although including also riparian birds waterfowl maquis species and nocturnal birds of prey that we did not consider in our study as it was focused on diurnal forest species we did not detect the presence of european nightjar caprimulgus europaeus l common cuckoo cuculus canorus l and eurasian hoopoe upupa epops l which were already considered as doubtful breeders in the astroni wwf italy 2008 in contrast to previous data we have recorded several nesting green woodpeckers that were always more abundant than great spotted woodpeckers in both ecosystems whereas in 2008 green woodpecker was reported as increasing in numbers but not nesting inside the area wwf italy 2008 such trend might suggest a competition displacement by green woodpecker vs great spotted woodpecker as already reported for other species in the mediterranean when in concomitance with land use changes de rosa et al 2018 compared to other deciduous forest ecosystem we have found a comparatively lower diversity of nesting birds balestrieri et al 2017 admittedly the small area of the crater along with the patchiness and the urbanization of the surrounding environments may have a detrimental effect on bird diversity basile et al 2016 mckinney 2008 nevertheless of the 12 bird species that were above 2 5 of the total in both ecosystems 6 species were considered as forest specialists gil tena et al 2007 namely blackcap blue tit chaffinch great spotted woodpecker jay and firecrest specialist forest species such as long tailed tit and robin were only occasional presence in the two ecosystems thus despite the absence of heavily specialised woodpeckers that indicate high forest environmental quality such as middle or lesser spotted woodpeckers mikusiński et al 2001 roberge and angelstam 2006 the astroni crater offered a diversified and specialized forest bird community our 2b pls approach allowed us to investigate patterns of covariance between forest and soil variables and nesting bird community whereas forest structure and management has been often used as a predictor in evaluating bird distribution and abundance balestrieri et al 2015 gil tena et al 2007 paillet et al 2010 the relationships between bird community and soil has been scarcely investigated our results showed that two species wood pigeon and great spotter woodpecker did not contribute to separate the covariance in the 2b pls indicating that their abundance in the astroni is not correlated to any forest or soil variable even though great spotted woodpecker is a specialised forest species this is one of the commonest and one of the least demanding species in environmental terms mikusiński et al 2001 while wood pigeon is becoming more and more an urbanized species with increasingly overlapping niche with feral pigeons fey et al 2015 on the other hand we have showed that different guilds of species are correlated with forest and soil variables in a peculiar way although in the lower left quadrant of the 2b pls only holm oak wood locations were distributed in the upper right quadrant mixed wood and holm oak wood were both present this indicates that our 2b pls does not simply indicate different bird community as related to forest type but clearly put forward the importance of soil related variables accordingly the abundance of species such as blue tit green woodpecker and great tit which are generalist cavity nesters balestrieri et al 2015 along with jay and blackcap had a direct covariance with c stock in litter the blue tit that was the species with the greatest correlation coefficient to axis 1 of 2b pls of the group usually forages on small arthropods in the forest canopy and has been previously shown as abundant in holm oak dominated ecosystems illera and atienza 1995 thus albeit blue tits do not directly forage on the forest floor their abundance is correlated to the presence of arthropods which in some part of their life cycle are abundant in the forest floor garcía palacios et al 2013 innangi et al 2018 parisi et al 2005 thus we can infer that higher c stock in the litter can support a larger community of arthropods which eventually sustain bird species such as tits and green woodpecker although this trend needs to be validated on a larger sample size and in ecosystems with greater extension on the other hand in the 2b pls analysis several locations belonging to both holm oak and mixed wood were characterized by greater c stocks in the soil and higher microbial activity along with abundance of other bird species most noticeably short toed treecreeper and blackbird the short toed treecreeper is a secondary cavity nester that feeds mostly on tree bark newton 1994 although this species is usually found in oak forests or mixed forests with prevalence of oaks snow et al 1997 in our case its presence was more abundant in hornbeam mixed wood where oaks quercus petraea and q robur represented approximately 10 of all tree species in our case short toed treecreeper was not one of the commonest species but its presence was highly indicative of greater stock of carbon and microbial activity in soil rather than litter moreover if we consider that mixed wood is a contiguous ecosystem inside the astroni s crater while holm oak wood is more fragmented this could also explain the greater abundance in the mixed wood of short toed treecreeper given its sensibility to forest patchiness basile et al 2016 as for blackbirds this highly opportunistic species mostly feeds on earthworms snow et al 1997 thus its greater presence in c richer soils can be linked to increased abundance of earthworms which thrive in soils richer in humus and microbial activity andriuzzi et al 2015 dempsey et al 2011 gormsen et al 2004 in conclusion we have provided an in depth survey of both soil and nesting bird community between the two main forest ecosystems inside the astroni crater highlighting its conservation value both in terms of c stock and species diversity within the urban area of naples moreover as a novelty our approach highlighted patterns of covariance between some forest bird species and different soil variables although some of our findings might be limited by the extent of our research area admittedly linking such distant ecological compartments might be considered risky and there might be confounding factors that we did not consider in this study accordingly there is a need to validate these results even on larger scale environments including forest ecosystems with and without management nevertheless our approach showed interesting outputs and could be important in linking forest ecological compartments whose connections in terms of matter and energy flows are not immediately detectable this could open new perspectives and potentiality in land use management both in terms of c stock and biodiversity evaluations acknowledgements the authors are very thankful to the riserva naturale oasi wwf cratere degli astroni and its director fabrizio canonico for their constant help and support during the surveys in the area the authors would like to

25118,forests are among the most important land ecosystems both in term of their contribution to the global carbon cycle and for their prominence in hosting large biodiversity under a changing world both in terms of land use and climate scenarios it is pivotal to understand the matter and energy flows in complex ecosystems such as forests in order to infer potential relationships at different levels i e from soil to bird community within the forest stands in this context soil organic matter is main source of carbon and energy for heterotrophic soil organisms which are a main component of the whole food web all the way up to bird communities even though many studies have investigated factors affecting c cycle and bird communities in forest ecosystems separately an integrated approach that links soil to bird community was never attempted accordingly we have used an innovative two block partial least squares analysis to investigate patterns of covariance between soil and nesting bird communities in a relatively small wooded area surrounded by the urban area of naples southern italy our research revealed that in spite of the small extent and the surrounding urban context the area of the astroni hosts a substantial c stock and has a diversified bird nesting community the abundance of species such as blue tit jay green woodpecker and great tit had a direct covariance with c stock in litter while sampling sites that were characterized by greater c stocks in the soil and higher microbial activity were correlated with abundance of other bird species most noticeably short toed treecreeper and blackbird despite the limited extent of our research area our study showed for the first time patterns of covariance between some forest species and different soil variables linking forest ecological compartments whose connections are not immediately detectable and that could open new perspectives in land use management both in terms of c stock and biodiversity evaluations keywords astroni blue tit carbon stocks holm oak hornbeam short toed treecreeper 1 introduction among the different land uses forests cover about 30 of the earth s surface and provide several ecosystem services whose importance is generally recognized gamfeldt et al 2013 within these ecosystem services we can include the fundamental role that forests play in the global carbon cycle and their importance for biodiversity in detail through the exchanges with the atmosphere by means of photosynthesis and respiration forests represent the most important c sink both in the biomass and in the organic matter present above and belowground ipcc 2013 additionally forests are of crucial importance for biodiversity with over 50 of the known terrestrial species found in the forests of the globe scbd 2001 the build up of c in the forests depends on the balance between primary productivity and the rate of decomposition of the plant residue current climate change can profoundly alter the balance between productivity and decay with relevant effects on soil organic matter som and forests zak et al 2011 in the mediterranean region such processes could result even in larger extent because climate changes are expected to be particularly severe giorgi and lionello 2008 accordingly while it is possible that climate change can transform some forests from sinks to sources of co2 meier and leuschner 2010 it is equally true that important changes are to be expected in numerous forest species with associated serious risks of biodiversity loss and changes in communities within few decades or at most centuries lindner et al 2010 forest soils rich in organic matter host diversified communities constituted by decomposers i e fungi and bacteria and consumers including a large number of soil fauna along the food web if present the abundance of decaying wood favours the development of rich communities to which birds are associated characterized by both generalist and highly specialized species thus there is a close relationship between som and soil biological activity because som is the main source of carbon and energy for heterotrophic soil organisms which are a main component of the whole food web all the way up to bird communities in particular birds have been widely studied as biological indicators in different ecosystems especially in forest ecosystems balestrieri et al 2015 in comparison with other animal groups bird communities are relatively simple to survey balestrieri et al 2017 and can provide substantial information on forest patchiness basile et al 2016 structure balestrieri et al 2015 or habitat conservation valerio et al 2016 although there is plenty of studies that analyse factors affecting c cycle and bird communities in forest ecosystems an integrated approach that links soil to bird community was never attempted nevertheless there is a growing interest and need in connecting ecosystem compartments on different trophic levels e g from producers to decomposers and or from detritivores to birds especially under a changing climate that might alter species distribution and carbon stocks simultaneously innangi et al 2015 moreover if connections between widespread or specialized bird forest species and soil c stock should be found a focused monitoring of bird species might be used in the future for inferring increased or decreased soil organic matter quantity and quality accordingly we have conducted both soil and bird community surveys in a relatively small wooded area inside the urban area of naples italy the area is composed by two forest ecosystems a holm oak wood and a mixed wood surrounded by a densely inhabited area we have used an innovative two block partial least squares 2b pls analysis to investigate patterns of covariance between several variables related to soil and nesting bird communities our work aimed to a investigate differences between the ecosystems in terms of forest structure soil and bird communities b examine the covariance between bird species and soil related variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the research was carried out within the astroni crater world wildlife fund wwf reserve in the volcanic area of campi flegrei in the urban area naples italy isaia et al 2004 the reserve 247 ha develops inside the caldera of an extinct volcano with a maximum elevation of 255 m a s l displaying an elliptical shape 2 1 6 km the inner part of the crater shows a deep depression that hosts a lake where a minimum elevation of 9 m a s l is reached in the central part of the crater nearby the larger lake there are two additional small lakes and three hills that stand above the bottom at 45 74 and 82 m a s l respectively fig 1 the peculiar conformation of the area determines a high level of humidity and a thermal inversion in the crater naples naples province 2007 therefore the lower part of the crater hosts a mesophilous vegetation mixed wood characterized by the dominance of hornbeams carpinus betulus l and ostrya carpinifolia scop and ash fraxinus ornus l along with oaks quercus petrea matt liebl q robur l and some q ilex l chestnuts castanea sativa mill elms ulmus minor mill as well as introduced species such as black locust robinia pseudoacacia l red oak q rubra l and canadian poplar populus deltoides w bartram ex marshall in the higher parts i e in the crater s rim and in the internal hills the vegetation is a holm oak wood q ilex with few other tree species such as ash and tree heath erica arborea l in small areas on the ridges and outside the crater a mediterranean maquis is found around the lakes the vegetation is characterized by swamp reeds phragmites australis cav trin ex steud rushes juncus effusus l and reedmace typha latifolia l while in the lakes myriophyllum spicatum l and ceratophyllum demersum l are dominant motti and ricciardi 2005 2 2 sampling sites in the whole crater we digitized the area of holm oak wood 127 ha and the area of mixed wood 104 ha in order to define the two main ecosystems in each area 10 sampling sites at least 200 m apart from each other were chosen randomly in a gis environment fig 2 table 1 summarizes the geographical and topographic characteristics of the sampling points samplings and surveys were conducted between april and october 2016 before the wildfires that heavily damaged the reserve in july 2017 2 3 estimation of carbon stocks in the phytomass and in the deadwood at each sampling site the forest structure was assessed using the protocol of the national inventory of forests and forest carbon sinks www infc it briefly in a circular surface with a radius of 13 m we have determined a tree species c diameter at breast height dbh on all specimens with diameter 5 cm c the presence size and quality of deadwood tree heights were obtained by gompertz regression based on hulshof et al 2015 in detail heights in meters y were estimated according to the following models considering x as the dbh in decimeters g y m n o s p e r m s y 25 3 e 2 1 e 0 93 x e v e r g r e e n a n g i o s p e r m s y 25 5 e 2 0 e 0 93 x d e c i d u o u s a n g i o s p e r m s y 24 8 e 1 9 e 0 94 x we have computed tree volume and phytomass according to tabacchi et al 2011 deadwood was also assessed subjectively for its degree of decomposition from 0 fresh wood to 4 highly decomposed wood the density was evaluated considering a gradient as reported in mäkipää and linkosalo 2011 and was evaluated in 0 744 kg dm3 for fresh wood and 0 279 kg dm3 for highly decomposed wood thus we have estimated carbon stocks in the biomass and in the deadwood considering c as 50 of the overall biomass and necromass brown 2002 2 4 soil and litter samplings along with biological and chemical measurements at each site 2 samples of litter were taken using a 20 cm 20 cm square metal and 2 soil cores in the 0 5 and 5 10 cm layers using a steel cylinder of 5 5 cm in diameter and 5 cm in length innangi et al 2017 for simplicity we will refer to the 0 5 cm layer as topsoil and to the 5 10 cm as subsoil respectively in the laboratory litter was weighed before and after its separation into 4 fractions i e leaf litter wood acorns and seeds and other materials e g bark the soil samples were sieved with 2 mm mesh sieves the gravel free dry mass of soil was used to compute bulk density throop et al 2012 an aliquot of both leaf litter and soil was dried to constant weight at 75 c and powered for subsequent analysis of organic matter and cellulose contents while a second aliquot was stored at 80 c for the determination of the fluorescein diacetate hydrolase activity organic matter content was determined by loss on ignition method soil samples were exposed at a temperature of 375 c for 16 h while leaf litter was incinerated at 550 c for 4 h the litter fractions of wood acorns and seeds and other materials were exposed at 650 c for 16 h the c content of both litter and soil was evaluated by halving som values pribyl 2010 cellulose content in litter and soil was determined using the experimental spectrophotometric method described by danise et al 2018 stocks of c and cellulose in both litter and soil were computed according to innangi et al 2015 fluorescein diacetate hydrolase fdah activity was determined according to green et al 2006 2 5 nesting bird community at each sampling site we employed temporally replicated point counts balestrieri et al 2017 in details surveys were carried out between 5 30 and 7 30 a m in all locations with three replicates between may and june during breeding season the central point of each plot was reached and the surveyor remained still for 5 min in order to allow birds to become accustomed to his her presence subsequently birds present in the area were recognized and recorded for 5 min according to their calls or songs with the aid of visual recognition when possible we used unrestricted radius counts given that in dense forest accurate measurements of distance are difficult to obtain nevertheless double counts of the same individuals from adjacent survey points are unlikely given the large distance between sampling points and the short duration of every count balestrieri et al 2017 results were expressed as individuals per plot birds whose relative abundance was less than 2 5 in both ecosystems were considered occasional or rare crisp and southward 1958 2 6 statistics species diversity for forest stands and bird communities was evaluated as shannon wiener diversity index h that is computed as h i 1 s n i ln n i where ni is the proportion of the individuals from the ith species to the overall individuals n of the s species for bird community we also reported dominance index d i 1 s n i 2 and evenness eh s all variables were inspected for outliers and for normality all data are represented as mean standard error of the mean differences between ecosystems i e holm oak wood vs mixed wood and among layers were tested by one way or two way analysis of variance anova transforming variables with box cox transformation with optimal lambda to ensure normality and homogeneity of variances osborne 2010 patterns of covariance between bird nesting community and forest soil variables were tested using two block partial least squares 2b pls this statistical technique belongs to the broader range of partial least square regression which is particularly apt to analyze a large array of related predictor variables with a sample size not as large as the number of independent variables carrascal et al 2009 in summary given two matrixes with different variables but same number of observations 2b pls will construct pairs of variables as linear combinations of the variables within each of the two sets which are constructed so that the new variables account for as much as possible of the covariation between the two original sets of variables innangi et al 2018 rohlf and corti 2000 such statistical technique was recently applied to forest ecosystems to investigate litter to topsoil chemical variations innangi et al 2017 as well as investigating simultaneous and interacting changes in chemical variables extracellular enzyme activities and soil fauna innangi et al 2018 the r packages ggplot2 and plsdepot were used to perform the analyses 3 results 3 1 main forest structure a total of 464 and 454 living trees were measured in the holm oak wood and in the mixed wood respectively the results of the tree diversity survey confirmed that in the holm oak wood holm oak was 70 of all trees followed by ash tree heath and black locust mixed wood showed a greater species diversity with a codominance of hornbeam carpinus betulus and ash along with other species such as acer campestre l ostrya carpinifolia quercus petraea q robur robinia pseudoacacia and q ilex as well the latter accounting for 12 of the total trees in the mixed wood shannon wiener diversity index was 0 5 0 3 in holm oak wood and 1 4 0 4 in the mixed wood both holm oak and mixed woods were comparable in terms of dbh and tree height while tree density and volume were higher in mixed wood although differences were not significant table 2 3 2 carbon stocks carbon stocks fig 3 did not statistically differ between the ecosystems two way anova f value 3 32 p value 0 072 while they differed among the layers two way anova f value 96 86 p value 0 001 accordingly the largest c stock was found in the phytomass with approximately 100 mg c ha in both holm oak and mixed woods fig 3 large c stocks were found also in subsoil with higher values in mixed wood fig 3 the c stocks of deadwood and topsoil were comparable whereas litter held the lowest c stock fig 3 considering the whole extension of the two ecosystems in the crater the overall estimates of c stocks were of 24 451 9650 mg c in the holm oak wood and 22 861 6455 in the mixed wood table 3 3 3 cellulose stocks cellulose stocks in litter topsoil and subsoil fig 4 did not statistically differ between the ecosystems two way anova f value 0 05 p value 0 820 by contrast they differed among the layers two way anova f value 44 99 p value 0 001 larger cellulose stocks were found in the topsoil as compared to the subsoil for both the woods fig 4 cellulose stock in leaf litter were lowest in mixed wood while they were comparable to subsoil in holm oak wood 3 4 fluorescein diacetate hydrolase activity fdah the fdah activity fig 5 significantly differed both between the ecosystems two way anova f value 9 71 p value 0 003 and among layers two way anova f value 326 73 p value 0 001 the activity was approximately 3 folds higher in litter compared to both layers of soil there was a shaper difference in topsoil and subsoil in holm oak wood whereas fdah in the mixed wood was more overlapping 3 5 bird nesting community in the two ecosystems a grand total of 18 species of nesting birds were ascertained table 4 a number of species i e common buzzard buteo buteo l common chiffchaff phylloscopus collybita l european serin serinus serinus l subalpine warbler sylvia cantillans pallas peregrine falcon falco peregrinus tunstall european bee eater merops apiaster l common raven corvus corax l and hooded crow corvus cornix l were seen or recorded sporadically during the field surveys but were not considered as nesting in any of the surveyed forest plots in the holm oak wood wood pigeon columba palumbus l blackcap sylvia atricapilla l blackbird turdus merula l and blue tit cyanistes caeruleus l were the most abundant species of the 16 species found in this ecosystem chaffinch fringilla coelebs l and jay garrulus glandarius l were both present at 3 8 of the total for holm oak wood while short toed treecreeper certhia brachydactyla brehm great spotted woodpecker dendrocopos major l and firecrest regulus ignicapilla temminck were below the threshold of 2 5 of the total abundance in comparison the mixed wood s most abundant species was wood pigeon followed by blackbird and wren troglodytes troglodytes l of the 15 species recorded in the mixed wood only jay was below the threshold of 2 5 of the total individuals while robin erithacus rubecula l wryneck jynx torquilla l cetti s warbler cettia cetti temminck magpie pica pica l long tailed tit aegithalos caudatus l and sardinian warbler sylvia melanocephala gmelin were considered occasional or rare in the crater each having an abundance 2 5 in both ecosystems in terms of species diversity the ecosystems were comparable both in terms of dominance d 0 10 and shannon wiener diversity index h 2 33 while evenness was slightly higher in the mixed wood compared to the holm oak wood 0 68 vs 0 64 respectively 3 6 two block partial least squares explained variance in axis 1 for block 1 bird community was 19 while block 2 soil variables explained 22 of total variance fig 6 a gradient can be seen from bottom left quadrant where all observations belong to holm oak wood to the top right quadrant where most observations derive from mixed wood although holm oak wood points are present as well on block 1 a neat separation of two groups of species can be seen accordingly blue tit jay blackcap green woodpecker and great tit are inversely correlated with short toed treecreeper blackbird firecrest chaffinch and wren great spotted woodpecker and wood pigeon explained almost no variance at all as for block 2 variables are neatly separated as well a group of four variables i e c and cellulose stocks in litter cellulose stock in subsoil and c stock in deadwood can be seen as inversely correlated with all the others with c stocks in the top and subsoil as the ivariables with the highest correlation coefficient with axis 1 thus in both blocks of 2b pls if we consider only the variables with the highest absolute values of the correlation coefficients with axis 1 i we can see that the abundance of blue tit can be seen as positively correlated to c stock in litter and inversely correlated with c stock in the subsoil while the opposite was true for short toed treecreeper 4 discussion our survey in the astroni crater confirmed that albeit surrounded by one of the largest and heavily inhabited city of europe there are many forest species that indicate a good degree of naturalness motti and ricciardi 2005 the overall tree vegetation was similar to previous surveys in the past cavara 1910 motti and ricciardi 2005 naples province 2007 nevertheless some peculiarity in forest structure emerged from our survey the structural complexity of a forest includes several variables e g tree density spatial arrangement size and height distribution and biodiversity mcelhinny et al 2005 physical environmental factors can lead to changes in forest structure and biodiversity structuring sylvan animal communities as well tanabe et al 2001 consequently a positive correlation between biodiversity and complexity of structural components within an ecosystem is usually found mac nally et al 2001 given the comparatively small area of the crater our estimates for carbon stocks in the two ecosystems can be considered highly indicative accurate estimates of forest biomass are pivotal both for commercial uses and for scientific studies for assessing the contribution of changes in forest lands to the global c cycle basuki et al 2009 henry et al 2010 accordingly the estimation of the above ground biomass is becoming increasingly important chave et al 2005 when compared to the data reported by the italian national inventory of forests and forest carbon sinks gasparini and tabacchi 2011 for region campania where astroni is located conspicuous differences emerge in terms of tree numerical density nevertheless it is important to highlight that given its peculiar history climate and context the astroni crater can hardly be compared to other italian forest ecosystems accordingly holm oak forests of campania show mean numerical density of 914 in ha and mean volume of 51 1 m3 ha while in hornbeam forests comparable to our mixed wood the numerical density reported is 2213 9 in ha and the volume equal to 71 m3 ha thus our tree density is remarkably lower but the tree volume is higher gorham 1979 showed that stands of single stemmed plants follow a simple rule relating shoot dry weight and standing crop to density thus an inverse relationship between the numerical density of the trees and the volume can explain differences between the astroni and the data from the national inventory this could be explained by the greater supply of light and nutrient supply of plants present in lower density forests the higher or lower volume of the plants also reflects on the biomass and consequently on the amount of stored carbon the world s forests store more than 650 billion tonnes of carbon 44 in the biomass 11 in deadwood and litter and 45 in the soil fao 2010 data that are proportionally confirmed in our findings despite the comparatively small dimensions of the crater the c stocks in the various forest compartments are considerable in fact whereas the litter and subsoil of both stands are in line with the national forest inventory data with holm oak and hornbeam forests of the campania region showing 2 2 and 1 1 mg c ha in the litter and 43 2 and 52 2 mg c ha in the subsoil respectively gasparini and tabacchi 2011 stocks in the other sectors are significantly higher accordingly holm oak and hornbeam forests of the campania region hold 22 1 and 21 4 mg c ha in the phytomass and 2 7 and 1 8 mg c ha in the topsoil respectively gasparini and tabacchi 2011 which are sensibly smaller than our findings carbon stock in the astroni soil in the first 0 5 cm is not too smaller than important forest ecosystems such as beech forests which host an average of 30 mg c ha in the topsoil innangi et al 2015 considering the sum of c stock in both topsoil and subsoil in the astroni we get a mean value of 52 mg c ha for holm oak wood and 67 mg c ha for mixed wood respectively which can be compared both to beech forests curcio et al 2017 and oak and even some coniferous forests schulp and nabuurs 2008 the c stocks in litter and soil also showed good quality along with quantity given their content in cellulose cellulose was recently shown as being a good indicator of humic substances danise et al 2018 thus indicating stable labile ratio of c into litter and soil despite the low amount of data available for cellulose in litter and soil for forest ecosystems if we sum the amount of cellulose in the litter and topsoil of the astroni we get mean values of 7 1 mg cell ha and 7 3 mg cell ha for holm oak and mixed wood respectively which are larger than what was found in an italian alder forest ecosystem where conversely c stock was higher innangi et al 2017 as for fdah this enzyme has been usually considered as a good indicator of microbial biomass in soils alarcón gutiérrez et al 2009 rao et al 2014 the activity decreased from litter to soil which is consistent with general findings of microbial activity and biomass in forest soils alarcón gutiérrez et al 2009 fioretto et al 2018 our results are in line with previous research green et al 2006 muscolo et al 2014 and testify high microbial presence and activity in the two studied ecosystems a former check list for nesting birds inside the astroni reported 44 species wwf italy 2008 although including also riparian birds waterfowl maquis species and nocturnal birds of prey that we did not consider in our study as it was focused on diurnal forest species we did not detect the presence of european nightjar caprimulgus europaeus l common cuckoo cuculus canorus l and eurasian hoopoe upupa epops l which were already considered as doubtful breeders in the astroni wwf italy 2008 in contrast to previous data we have recorded several nesting green woodpeckers that were always more abundant than great spotted woodpeckers in both ecosystems whereas in 2008 green woodpecker was reported as increasing in numbers but not nesting inside the area wwf italy 2008 such trend might suggest a competition displacement by green woodpecker vs great spotted woodpecker as already reported for other species in the mediterranean when in concomitance with land use changes de rosa et al 2018 compared to other deciduous forest ecosystem we have found a comparatively lower diversity of nesting birds balestrieri et al 2017 admittedly the small area of the crater along with the patchiness and the urbanization of the surrounding environments may have a detrimental effect on bird diversity basile et al 2016 mckinney 2008 nevertheless of the 12 bird species that were above 2 5 of the total in both ecosystems 6 species were considered as forest specialists gil tena et al 2007 namely blackcap blue tit chaffinch great spotted woodpecker jay and firecrest specialist forest species such as long tailed tit and robin were only occasional presence in the two ecosystems thus despite the absence of heavily specialised woodpeckers that indicate high forest environmental quality such as middle or lesser spotted woodpeckers mikusiński et al 2001 roberge and angelstam 2006 the astroni crater offered a diversified and specialized forest bird community our 2b pls approach allowed us to investigate patterns of covariance between forest and soil variables and nesting bird community whereas forest structure and management has been often used as a predictor in evaluating bird distribution and abundance balestrieri et al 2015 gil tena et al 2007 paillet et al 2010 the relationships between bird community and soil has been scarcely investigated our results showed that two species wood pigeon and great spotter woodpecker did not contribute to separate the covariance in the 2b pls indicating that their abundance in the astroni is not correlated to any forest or soil variable even though great spotted woodpecker is a specialised forest species this is one of the commonest and one of the least demanding species in environmental terms mikusiński et al 2001 while wood pigeon is becoming more and more an urbanized species with increasingly overlapping niche with feral pigeons fey et al 2015 on the other hand we have showed that different guilds of species are correlated with forest and soil variables in a peculiar way although in the lower left quadrant of the 2b pls only holm oak wood locations were distributed in the upper right quadrant mixed wood and holm oak wood were both present this indicates that our 2b pls does not simply indicate different bird community as related to forest type but clearly put forward the importance of soil related variables accordingly the abundance of species such as blue tit green woodpecker and great tit which are generalist cavity nesters balestrieri et al 2015 along with jay and blackcap had a direct covariance with c stock in litter the blue tit that was the species with the greatest correlation coefficient to axis 1 of 2b pls of the group usually forages on small arthropods in the forest canopy and has been previously shown as abundant in holm oak dominated ecosystems illera and atienza 1995 thus albeit blue tits do not directly forage on the forest floor their abundance is correlated to the presence of arthropods which in some part of their life cycle are abundant in the forest floor garcía palacios et al 2013 innangi et al 2018 parisi et al 2005 thus we can infer that higher c stock in the litter can support a larger community of arthropods which eventually sustain bird species such as tits and green woodpecker although this trend needs to be validated on a larger sample size and in ecosystems with greater extension on the other hand in the 2b pls analysis several locations belonging to both holm oak and mixed wood were characterized by greater c stocks in the soil and higher microbial activity along with abundance of other bird species most noticeably short toed treecreeper and blackbird the short toed treecreeper is a secondary cavity nester that feeds mostly on tree bark newton 1994 although this species is usually found in oak forests or mixed forests with prevalence of oaks snow et al 1997 in our case its presence was more abundant in hornbeam mixed wood where oaks quercus petraea and q robur represented approximately 10 of all tree species in our case short toed treecreeper was not one of the commonest species but its presence was highly indicative of greater stock of carbon and microbial activity in soil rather than litter moreover if we consider that mixed wood is a contiguous ecosystem inside the astroni s crater while holm oak wood is more fragmented this could also explain the greater abundance in the mixed wood of short toed treecreeper given its sensibility to forest patchiness basile et al 2016 as for blackbirds this highly opportunistic species mostly feeds on earthworms snow et al 1997 thus its greater presence in c richer soils can be linked to increased abundance of earthworms which thrive in soils richer in humus and microbial activity andriuzzi et al 2015 dempsey et al 2011 gormsen et al 2004 in conclusion we have provided an in depth survey of both soil and nesting bird community between the two main forest ecosystems inside the astroni crater highlighting its conservation value both in terms of c stock and species diversity within the urban area of naples moreover as a novelty our approach highlighted patterns of covariance between some forest bird species and different soil variables although some of our findings might be limited by the extent of our research area admittedly linking such distant ecological compartments might be considered risky and there might be confounding factors that we did not consider in this study accordingly there is a need to validate these results even on larger scale environments including forest ecosystems with and without management nevertheless our approach showed interesting outputs and could be important in linking forest ecological compartments whose connections in terms of matter and energy flows are not immediately detectable this could open new perspectives and potentiality in land use management both in terms of c stock and biodiversity evaluations acknowledgements the authors

introduction species interaction is the basis on which community diversity is established and maintained species interactions recruitment dynamics dispersal and so on jointly determine species composition and species abundance and shape the structure and function of ecological communities and ecosystems tilman 1997 fernández et al 1999 isbell et al 2011 to understand and predict the dynamics of multi species systems it is generally necessary to estimate the strength of interactions among the species that make up a given multi species system mougi and kondoh 2012 however quantifying species interactions poses a challenge because of the large number of interactions in a natural system long term feedback multiple pathways of effects between pairs of species and possible nonlinearities in the functions that determine the strength of different interactions berlow et al 1999 wootton and emmerson 2005 melián 2009 wells and o hara 2013 benkman 2013 at the same time the complexity of species interactions is also reflected in the growth of individuals population development and the formation stability and decline of a community on different temporal and spatial scales loreau 2010 harrison et al 2015 interactions among species are based on biophysical mechanisms including genetic characteristics functional traits of individuals resource availability and environmental heterogeneity the processes of interaction among species and the different community structures have different ecological functions whitham et al 2006 odum 1969 herschgreen et al 2011 patten and odum 2012 zengler and palsson 2012 although a community cannot evolve directly through genetic change as species communities evolve by improving the capacity of the entire community to exist goodnight charles 2000 verboef and morin 2010 therefore no matter how complex the process of formation of a community and how complex the interactions among species the community will eventually realize the utilization efficiency of resources to the maximum extent to attain the status of an ecologically stable community and to match the living environment trautz et al 2017 in a more comprehensive sense the essence of species interaction research is to measure the impact of each species on community diversity by species interactions mougi and kondoh 2012 species interaction research includes not only the interactions between species wootton and emmerson 2005 melián et al 2009 wells and o hara 2013 benkman 2013 but also the intensity of intraspecific density dependence and the possession of new resource patches so species interaction research must answer the following questions what is the effect of species interaction in the community what is the relationship between intraspecific density dependence and interspecific density dependence shinozaki and kira 1956 han et al 2014 can the changes of community plant diversity be predicted by species interaction models with the changes in resources under global climate change especially the changes of minimum restriction resources the purpose of this study is to answer above problems mathematically under the conditions of a stable community for furthering understanding of the mechanism of interaction considering the complexity of species interaction we can start with an ecologically stable community instead of starting from the process of community formation after all interactions among species in an ecologically stable community correspond to the local environment and resources we established a competitive abilities model and a species interaction strength based on the evolutionarily stable strategy theory which belongs to the game theory with this model the density dependent function of each species in the community is given and we seek to explain the mechanism of climate driven loss of diversity in a grassland community by analyzing published data 2 model and methods the theory of evolutionary stability as an important contents of game theory reeve and dugatkin 1998 nowak and sigmund 2004 cressman 2013 was established on the basis of the direct and indirect effects of interactions and is thus an important tool for understanding the patterns and mechanisms of competition for resources fig 1 reeve and dugatkin 1998 smith and price 2010 uller and pen 2011 zhang et al 2014 from a long term perspective regardless of the level individual population or community evolutionary outcomes often follow a fitness maximizing equilibrium which is the simplest and also one of most important equilibria in understanding communities using the evolutionary game theory therefore species interaction should be measured based on the theory of evolutionary stability simplifying a complex problem the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy theory is strongly associated with a symmetric equilibrium point reeve and dugatkin 1998 smith and price 2010 uller and pen 2011 zhang et al 2014 cressman 2013 in this paper an ecologically stable community is defined as that there is species coexist in the community and the species richness of the community are stable and the community reaches the highest resources utilization efficiency frey 2010 when there arise unoccupied or vacant place niche temporarily because plants die naturally or through some disturbance and these places are then occupied by other species the competitive ability to occupy an unoccupied or vacant place of species is same such ecologically stable communities prove the bishop cannings theorem cannings 1990 which maintains that the competitive ability of an evolutionarily stable strategy in a community and the pure strategy of that community are equal under a given situation if only one specific strategy is selected this strategy is a pure strategy if a different strategy with only a certain probability is chosen it is called a mixed strategy the competitive ability of an ecologically stable community should be defined firstly which reflect the results of competition among species the structure and composition of the community and species interactions the relationships between species fitness šajna and kušar 2014 and community stability are possible functions of species interaction and the competitive ability of a species is defined as its ability to occupy an unoccupied or vacant place niche reflected in such attributes as the number of seeds that can germinate and grow successfully thus mathematical models of the community competitive ability were established as follows fig 1 2 1 a resources constrain species coexistence in an ecological stable community in an ecologically stable community among s species in a community mutual competition and cooperation occur through direct and indirect interactions the species s coexist in the community and the relative proportions of different species affect the community according to the niche theory species abundance is proportional to the availability of necessary resources stochastic models of niche orientation indicate the presence of a minimum restriction resource tokeshi 2009 farrior et al 2013 although there are many factors affecting plant diversity there are also the most basic restricted resources such as water water is the main driving force of plant metabolism and nutrient absorption 85 90 of a plant is water at the same time water is an important solvent which affects the movement of nutrients in soil and through roots and indirectly affects the availability soil carbon dioxide and microbial activity in the rhizosphere water is also a widespread niche jonathan et al 2015 here the total quantity of minimum limitation resources is denoted as c if ni is the abundance of the ith species i 1 2 s an ecologically stable community with multiple coexisting species is described as 1 i 1 s n i c i c where ci is the average share in the minimum restriction resource of the ith species according to individual requirements and competitiveness for resources the share of the minimum restriction resource represented by the requirements of the ith species is the most important factor for the present status of a species and reflects the overall performance of individual functional traits such as body size leaf area index and individual competitiveness hence ci is the average share in resources of individuals in the population of the ith species based on average individual requirements and competitiveness 2 2 species coexistence in an ecologically stable community is subject to some necessary conditions due to long term competition and adaptation zhang et al 2012 each species uses resources to ensure its fitness and its resource utilization efficiency remains the same in a given region it is important to know how the resource utilization efficiency of a community p c can be measured the average share of resources such as water and light is determined by leaf area therefore in this paper we chose an appropriate experimental index that let the resource utilization efficiency of a community p be the reciprocal of the mean specific leaf area sla where leaf area c in leaf area dry mass so that we chose sla mm² g 1 as the resource utilization efficiency of a community of that community in other words p c 1 sla we chose 1 sla mm² g 1 because of its widely documented links to water balance and the community level consequences of aridification dwyer et al 2014 and 1 sla can be seen as a multidimensional niche affected by key resources such as water carbon dioxide and light for individuals within a species the larger the average share of resources of the ith species based on individual requirements and competitiveness for resources the larger the fitness of the individual under long term evolution the larger the resource utilization efficiency the greater the individual fitness the fitness fj of an average individual of ith species within a species is defined in terms of the average fitness 2 fj p cj j 1 2 s the difference in the species abundance within a community was seen as a different community strategy to achieve an ecologically stable community and stable species coexistence ratios of species abundance in the community were considered a mixed strategy of the community frey 2010 hence the number ni of ith species is greater than 0 i 1 2 s and the relative proportion λi is greater than 0 i 1 2 s firstly we believed that there also was the ith species fitness yi for each species e g when the species i was the only species in the community the population size ni in a unit area species density was the most important factor in yi gotelli 1991 the larger the nifi the higher the fitness of species i moreover use of resources by populations is indirectly indicated at the individual level and the emergence of resource competition constraints need not limit the species fitness as yi nifi i 1 2 s then there was the definition of the competitive ability of the ith species yi y1 y2 ys at the species level in a community the ability of ith species to occupy an unoccupied or vacant place niche because of interspecific interactions in a community the competitive ability of the ith species will be restricted by other individuals and other species in the community thus the limiting factor is expressed as fi y1 y2 ys and the competitive ability of the ith species yi y1 y2 ys in a community can be written as follows 3 yi y1 y2 ys fi y1 y2 ys yi ni fifi y1 y2 ys i 1 2 s accordingly the average of competitive abilities of all species y y1 y2 ys the competitive abilities of community can be defined as the average of competitive abilities of all species in that community weighted by the relative proportion of each species 4 y y 1 y 2 y s i 1 s λ i y i y 1 y 2 y s where i 1 s λ i 1 upon achieving evolutionarily stable coexistence within a community the following properties can be described using the reciprocal yield law proposed by shinozaki and kira shinozaki k kira 1956 for more information please see supporting materials a the first assumption is that a community evolves steadily hence the limiting factor fi y1 y2 ys should have the following properties frey 2010 levins and culver 1971 tokeshi 2009 i self limiting lim y i f i y 1 y 2 y s 0 if external constraints predominating over internal constraints are not self limiting evolutionarily stable coexistence cannot emerge in that community therefore external constraints predominating over internal constraints must be self limiting because of the evolutionarily stable coexistence of species in a community when the fitness of some species is higher external constraints predominate over internal constraints to allow other species to coexist frey 2010 ii bounded when some species have a very high level of fitness limitations of space and effects of self limitation mean that the fitness of the species in the community is defined by boundaries lim y i y i f i y 1 y 2 y s y i iii coexistence when the numbers of a given species become low following short term environmental changes the species exhibits greater fitness to recover its original proportion in the community and thereby guarantees its stable coexistence tokeshi 2009 lim y i 0 f i y 1 y 2 y s 1 iv symmetry tokeshi 2009 fi y1 y2 ys is symmetry and fi ky1 ky2 kys fi y1 y2 ys interactions among different species are predominantly density dependent our hypothesis is that if the fitness of each species such p increases k times is simultaneously increased k times with k being small the competitive abilities of all the species increase only k k times and the limiting factor for every species remains unchanged han et al 2016 when a community of s coexisting species is assumed to be evolutionarily stable according to the bishop cannings theorem the competitive ability the ability to occupy the blank plaque of an evolutionarily stable strategy of a community and the pure strategy of that community are equal 5 y y1 y2 ys yi y1 y2 ys i 1 2 s a simple understanding of eq 5 is that when a community reaches evolutionarily stable coexistence the competitive abilities the ability to occupy the blank plaque of all species are the same accordingly y y1 y2 ys yj fj y1 y2 ys yi fi y1 y2 ys i j 1 2 s according to the above equation the four properties of the limiting factors and the simple principle fi y1 y2 ys are identified as follows for more information please see supporting materials b 6 fi y1 y2 ys 1 yi 1 y1 1 y2 1 ys i 1 2 s the determining mechanisms that cause interactions to vary across space and time in natural ecosystems are unchanged therefore in a local area the interaction strength in eq 6 should also be applied to the communities in which species are determined by environment filtration regardless of the evolutionarily stable coexistence of species in a plant community to find strategies for evolutionarily stable mixed communities there was the following optimization problem fig 1 7 max y y 1 y 2 y s 1 1 y 1 1 y 2 1 y s i 1 s n i f i k 1 s i 1 i k s n i f i 8 s t i 1 s n i c i c f j c j p c i 1 2 s eq 7 represent the average of competitive abilities of all the species in the model eqs 7 and 8 therefore the harmonic mean maximum is achieved using the evolutionarily stable strategy and eq 6 is the interaction strength of competition in the community which is the comprehensive effect of interactions among species antagonism and mutualism as they evolve and adapt 3 results two results were generated from our model for the general case fig 1 the first was that species interactions can be used to derive density dependent laws for every species according to the limiting factor fi y1 y2 ys eq 6 can be rewritten as eq 9 as follows 9 fi y1 y2 ys 1 ni fi 1 n1 f1 1 n2 f2 1 ns fs qi qi ni where 10 q i 1 f i j 1 j i s 1 n j f j 1 s 1 c i s 1 j 1 j i s n j c j eq 9 embodies the reciprocal yield law f n n n q first proposed by shinozaki and kira 1956 where q is the carrying capacity of the system n is the number of individuals of one species and qi is the carrying capacity of the system for the ith species or the maximum density of adults of the ith species that the environment can support eq 9 is also an intraspecific interaction law the carrying capacity of the environment is determined by the amount of resources we observed that the density dependent laws of all species produced by the interaction strengths of the communities eq 9 are similar to the reciprocal yield law in addition when the total consumption of other species remained unchanged the larger the difference among the consumption of these species the smaller was the harmonic mean of other species consumption of resources thereby resulting in a larger carrying capacity for the ith species the reciprocal yield law is one of the most important density dependent laws within a species and is a component of the population theory accordingly eq 9 demonstrates that the interactions of a species in a community can be used to derive density dependent laws for all species in that community thereby providing a link between the population theory and the community diversity theory the second result generated by the model was that when densities of different species change for resources utilization according to eqs 7 and 8 the maximum ability to occupy the blank plaque the competitive abilities of community y can be calculated using the lagrange method under conditions of evolutionary stability as follows 11 y cp s2 12 s s i 1 s 1 y i c p when all species in a community are in an evolutionarily stable coexistence and the competitive abilities of community was maximum the product of the harmonic mean of the fitness of all species s i 1 s 1 y i s y and the community richness is equal to the product of the total amount of minimal restriction resources and the resources utilization efficiency of the community in theory see eq 12 once an ecologically stable community is formed the main goal of the community was maintaining the competitive abilities of community by regulated the number of species and to maximize the resources utilization efficiency of the community thus 13 s p s sla c sy where y can be seen as constant we considered water as the minimal restriction resource in this study and c ac1 b where c1 is the annual precipitation during growth stage a and b are constants we thus have a simple relation from eq 13 namely 14 s2 sla ac1 b where a and b were the fitting constants with a a y and b b y globally community biodiversity has decreased over the recent decades because of climate change we validated the model using data published on the pnas harrison et al 2015 the experiment is briefly introduced as follows in a california grassland plant diversity declined between 2000 and 2014 on the landscape scale 27 km² across multiple functional groups and soil environments serpentine and non serpentine soil the study took place at the university of california mclaughlin reserve a 2 776 ha facility at 366 914 m elevation in the inner north coast range n 38 52 w 122 26 the climate is mediterranean with mean annual temperatures of 8 c in january and 25 c in july and mean annual rainfall of 62 cm falling mainly in oct apr substrates include fertile soils derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks and infertile mg rich and nutrient poor soils derived from serpentine rock grasslands are dominated by annual species primarily native and exotic annual forbs nongrasses that flower in april july in addition to approximately 10 species of exotic eurasian annual grasses that flower in may jun species composition was sampled annually in april and june in the paper the most important finding was climate driven directional loss of species diversity in ecological communities in a natural nonexperimental setting harrison et al 2015 which was very similar to eq 14 we tested eq 14 by analysing published data including the precipitation during the growth stages c1 the species richness s and the average sla of grassland species in the community the results indicate that our model can explain the changes in diversity as seen in the data from observations over the 15 years fig 2 which also tested eq 13 once an ecologically stable community is formed the main goal of the community was maintaining the competitive abilities of community 4 discussion a new interactions strength was developed which predicts the comprehensive effect of interactions both antagonism and mutualism among species as they evolve and adapt interactions between species are highly complex and have been studied both experimentally and theoretically wootton and emmerson 2005 wells and o hara 2013 benkman 2013 such interactions can be between pairs abrams 2001 wootton and emmerson 2005 among multiple species mougi and kondoh 2012 based on the competition for resources or niches fort 2015 or in the form of an interaction net wells and o hara 2013 benkman 2013 however accurate descriptions of interactions between species in plant communities are hard to find our approach began with the ultimate state of community evolution and made full use of the conditions of evolutionarily stable coexistence so avoiding complex processes and factors we summed up the quantitative relationships between community richness and the harmonic mean of the fitness of all species based on an accurate description of interactions among species in a plant community see eq 12 species diversity is closely related to community stability and the harmonic mean of the fitness of all species is closely linked to community function thus our model has enriched the literature on the relations between community stability and community function the results seen in fig 2 are consistent with the predictions of our model indicating that eqs 6 and 7 can be used also in more general cases we observed that density dependent laws exist for all species at the population level and govern interaction strengths of communities which in turn are similar to the reciprocal yield law intraspecific interaction strength there is more information in the maximum density of adults in the ith species reciprocal yield laws of a single species can be extrapolated from the community interactions strength although several earlier studies have explored the theoretical and experimental applications of the reciprocal yield law shinozaki and kira 1956 han et al 2014 the present model based on the theories of community and evolutionary stability is entirely new our work offers a novel unification theory in which interspecific and intraspecific interactions strengths are unified in the process of competition for resources this reunification helps us to understand the role of intraspecific interactions in the formation and maintenance of communities zengler and palsson 2012 we have uncovered a function for the harmonic mean of fitness for all species and when the average of competitive abilities of all species reaches its maximum value this function reflects the total amount of minimal restriction resources and the resource utilization efficiency of the community we discovered that once the ability of different species in a community to occupy any blank plaque reaches its maximum the product of the harmonic mean of the fitness of all species and species richness is equal to the product of the total amount of minimal restriction resources and the resources utilization efficiency of the community thus the total amount of minimal restriction resources and the resource utilization efficiency of the community are inversely related for the same total amount of resources and the same level of resource utilization efficiency of the community greater species diversity lowers the community productivity which sets an upper limit for plant diversity this result also explains the differences in the results of trade offs related to diversity and the harmonic mean of the fitness of all species between natural and artificial communities of plants mccann 2000 because natural communities need to increase their species diversity to improve their stability however maximum fitness is often the most important goal of an artificial plant community a crop therefore the stability of such a community is lower than that of a natural plant community and stability is necessary for maintaining artificial environments the applications of the competitive ability model equation and the community interaction strength require further verification although the evolutionarily stable theory has uncovered the extraordinary ecological significance of the harmonic mean more important the harmonic mean maximum is evolutionarily stable species composition with different distribution frequencies in a community is the basis of community stability therefore a species with low frequency distribution always plays an important part in community stability currently climate change has profound impacts on biodiversity among the components of climate change the effect of changes in precipitation is the largest knapp et al 2008 craine et al 2012 harrison et al 2015 it is necessary to propose a model that can predict the impact of climate change on biodiversity in the present study although the plant diversity model was derived based on an ecological stable community the model s predictions corresponded closely to the observed variability in plant diversity the model is similar to the model of island geography based on the stable community which was used for planning protected areas to conserve endangered

introduction species interaction is the basis on which community diversity is established and maintained species interactions recruitment dynamics dispersal and so on jointly determine species composition and species abundance and shape the structure and function of ecological communities and ecosystems tilman 1997 fernández et al 1999 isbell et al 2011 to understand and predict the dynamics of multi species systems it is generally necessary to estimate the strength of interactions among the species that make up a given multi species system mougi and kondoh 2012 however quantifying species interactions poses a challenge because of the large number of interactions in a natural system long term feedback multiple pathways of effects between pairs of species and possible nonlinearities in the functions that determine the strength of different interactions berlow et al 1999 wootton and emmerson 2005 melián 2009 wells and o hara 2013 benkman 2013 at the same time the complexity of species interactions is also reflected in the growth of individuals population development and the formation stability and decline of a community on different temporal and spatial scales loreau 2010 harrison et al 2015 interactions among species are based on biophysical mechanisms including genetic characteristics functional traits of individuals resource availability and environmental heterogeneity the processes of interaction among species and the different community structures have different ecological functions whitham et al 2006 odum 1969 herschgreen et al 2011 patten and odum 2012 zengler and palsson 2012 although a community cannot evolve directly through genetic change as species communities evolve by improving the capacity of the entire community to exist goodnight charles 2000 verboef and morin 2010 therefore no matter how complex the process of formation of a community and how complex the interactions among species the community will eventually realize the utilization efficiency of resources to the maximum extent to attain the status of an ecologically stable community and to match the living environment trautz et al 2017 in a more comprehensive sense the essence of species interaction research is to measure the impact of each species on community diversity by species interactions mougi and kondoh 2012 species interaction research includes not only the interactions between species wootton and emmerson 2005 melián et al 2009 wells and o hara 2013 benkman 2013 but also the intensity of intraspecific density dependence and the possession of new resource patches so species interaction research must answer the following questions what is the effect of species interaction in the community what is the relationship between intraspecific density dependence and interspecific density dependence shinozaki and kira 1956 han et al 2014 can the changes of community plant diversity be predicted by species interaction models with the changes in resources under global climate change especially the changes of minimum restriction resources the purpose of this study is to answer above problems mathematically under the conditions of a stable community for furthering understanding of the mechanism of interaction considering the complexity of species interaction we can start with an ecologically stable community instead of starting from the process of community formation after all interactions among species in an ecologically stable community correspond to the local environment and resources we established a competitive abilities model and a species interaction strength based on the evolutionarily stable strategy theory which belongs to the game theory with this model the density dependent function of each species in the community is given and we seek to explain the mechanism of climate driven loss of diversity in a grassland community by analyzing published data 2 model and methods the theory of evolutionary stability as an important contents of game theory reeve and dugatkin 1998 nowak and sigmund 2004 cressman 2013 was established on the basis of the direct and indirect effects of interactions and is thus an important tool for understanding the patterns and mechanisms of competition for resources fig 1 reeve and dugatkin 1998 smith and price 2010 uller and pen 2011 zhang et al 2014 from a long term perspective regardless of the level individual population or community evolutionary outcomes often follow a fitness maximizing equilibrium which is the simplest and also one of most important equilibria in understanding communities using the evolutionary game theory therefore species interaction should be measured based on the theory of evolutionary stability simplifying a complex problem the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy theory is strongly associated with a symmetric equilibrium point reeve and dugatkin 1998 smith and price 2010 uller and pen 2011 zhang et al 2014 cressman 2013 in this paper an ecologically stable community is defined as that there is species coexist in the community and the species richness of the community are stable and the community reaches the highest resources utilization efficiency frey 2010 when there arise unoccupied or vacant place niche temporarily because plants die naturally or through some disturbance and these places are then occupied by other species the competitive ability to occupy an unoccupied or vacant place of species is same such ecologically stable communities prove the bishop cannings theorem cannings 1990 which maintains that the competitive ability of an evolutionarily stable strategy in a community and the pure strategy of that community are equal under a given situation if only one specific strategy is selected this strategy is a pure strategy if a different strategy with only a certain probability is chosen it is called a mixed strategy the competitive ability of an ecologically stable community should be defined firstly which reflect the results of competition among species the structure and composition of the community and species interactions the relationships between species fitness šajna and kušar 2014 and community stability are possible functions of species interaction and the competitive ability of a species is defined as its ability to occupy an unoccupied or vacant place niche reflected in such attributes as the number of seeds that can germinate and grow successfully thus mathematical models of the community competitive ability were established as follows fig 1 2 1 a resources constrain species coexistence in an ecological stable community in an ecologically stable community among s species in a community mutual competition and cooperation occur through direct and indirect interactions the species s coexist in the community and the relative proportions of different species affect the community according to the niche theory species abundance is proportional to the availability of necessary resources stochastic models of niche orientation indicate the presence of a minimum restriction resource tokeshi 2009 farrior et al 2013 although there are many factors affecting plant diversity there are also the most basic restricted resources such as water water is the main driving force of plant metabolism and nutrient absorption 85 90 of a plant is water at the same time water is an important solvent which affects the movement of nutrients in soil and through roots and indirectly affects the availability soil carbon dioxide and microbial activity in the rhizosphere water is also a widespread niche jonathan et al 2015 here the total quantity of minimum limitation resources is denoted as c if ni is the abundance of the ith species i 1 2 s an ecologically stable community with multiple coexisting species is described as 1 i 1 s n i c i c where ci is the average share in the minimum restriction resource of the ith species according to individual requirements and competitiveness for resources the share of the minimum restriction resource represented by the requirements of the ith species is the most important factor for the present status of a species and reflects the overall performance of individual functional traits such as body size leaf area index and individual competitiveness hence ci is the average share in resources of individuals in the population of the ith species based on average individual requirements and competitiveness 2 2 species coexistence in an ecologically stable community is subject to some necessary conditions due to long term competition and adaptation zhang et al 2012 each species uses resources to ensure its fitness and its resource utilization efficiency remains the same in a given region it is important to know how the resource utilization efficiency of a community p c can be measured the average share of resources such as water and light is determined by leaf area therefore in this paper we chose an appropriate experimental index that let the resource utilization efficiency of a community p be the reciprocal of the mean specific leaf area sla where leaf area c in leaf area dry mass so that we chose sla mm² g 1 as the resource utilization efficiency of a community of that community in other words p c 1 sla we chose 1 sla mm² g 1 because of its widely documented links to water balance and the community level consequences of aridification dwyer et al 2014 and 1 sla can be seen as a multidimensional niche affected by key resources such as water carbon dioxide and light for individuals within a species the larger the average share of resources of the ith species based on individual requirements and competitiveness for resources the larger the fitness of the individual under long term evolution the larger the resource utilization efficiency the greater the individual fitness the fitness fj of an average individual of ith species within a species is defined in terms of the average fitness 2 fj p cj j 1 2 s the difference in the species abundance within a community was seen as a different community strategy to achieve an ecologically stable community and stable species coexistence ratios of species abundance in the community were considered a mixed strategy of the community frey 2010 hence the number ni of ith species is greater than 0 i 1 2 s and the relative proportion λi is greater than 0 i 1 2 s firstly we believed that there also was the ith species fitness yi for each species e g when the species i was the only species in the community the population size ni in a unit area species density was the most important factor in yi gotelli 1991 the larger the nifi the higher the fitness of species i moreover use of resources by populations is indirectly indicated at the individual level and the emergence of resource competition constraints need not limit the species fitness as yi nifi i 1 2 s then there was the definition of the competitive ability of the ith species yi y1 y2 ys at the species level in a community the ability of ith species to occupy an unoccupied or vacant place niche because of interspecific interactions in a community the competitive ability of the ith species will be restricted by other individuals and other species in the community thus the limiting factor is expressed as fi y1 y2 ys and the competitive ability of the ith species yi y1 y2 ys in a community can be written as follows 3 yi y1 y2 ys fi y1 y2 ys yi ni fifi y1 y2 ys i 1 2 s accordingly the average of competitive abilities of all species y y1 y2 ys the competitive abilities of community can be defined as the average of competitive abilities of all species in that community weighted by the relative proportion of each species 4 y y 1 y 2 y s i 1 s λ i y i y 1 y 2 y s where i 1 s λ i 1 upon achieving evolutionarily stable coexistence within a community the following properties can be described using the reciprocal yield law proposed by shinozaki and kira shinozaki k kira 1956 for more information please see supporting materials a the first assumption is that a community evolves steadily hence the limiting factor fi y1 y2 ys should have the following properties frey 2010 levins and culver 1971 tokeshi 2009 i self limiting lim y i f i y 1 y 2 y s 0 if external constraints predominating over internal constraints are not self limiting evolutionarily stable coexistence cannot emerge in that community therefore external constraints predominating over internal constraints must be self limiting because of the evolutionarily stable coexistence of species in a community when the fitness of some species is higher external constraints predominate over internal constraints to allow other species to coexist frey 2010 ii bounded when some species have a very high level of fitness limitations of space and effects of self limitation mean that the fitness of the species in the community is defined by boundaries lim y i y i f i y 1 y 2 y s y i iii coexistence when the numbers of a given species become low following short term environmental changes the species exhibits greater fitness to recover its original proportion in the community and thereby guarantees its stable coexistence tokeshi 2009 lim y i 0 f i y 1 y 2 y s 1 iv symmetry tokeshi 2009 fi y1 y2 ys is symmetry and fi ky1 ky2 kys fi y1 y2 ys interactions among different species are predominantly density dependent our hypothesis is that if the fitness of each species such p increases k times is simultaneously increased k times with k being small the competitive abilities of all the species increase only k k times and the limiting factor for every species remains unchanged han et al 2016 when a community of s coexisting species is assumed to be evolutionarily stable according to the bishop cannings theorem the competitive ability the ability to occupy the blank plaque of an evolutionarily stable strategy of a community and the pure strategy of that community are equal 5 y y1 y2 ys yi y1 y2 ys i 1 2 s a simple understanding of eq 5 is that when a community reaches evolutionarily stable coexistence the competitive abilities the ability to occupy the blank plaque of all species are the same accordingly y y1 y2 ys yj fj y1 y2 ys yi fi y1 y2 ys i j 1 2 s according to the above equation the four properties of the limiting factors and the simple principle fi y1 y2 ys are identified as follows for more information please see supporting materials b 6 fi y1 y2 ys 1 yi 1 y1 1 y2 1 ys i 1 2 s the determining mechanisms that cause interactions to vary across space and time in natural ecosystems are unchanged therefore in a local area the interaction strength in eq 6 should also be applied to the communities in which species are determined by environment filtration regardless of the evolutionarily stable coexistence of species in a plant community to find strategies for evolutionarily stable mixed communities there was the following optimization problem fig 1 7 max y y 1 y 2 y s 1 1 y 1 1 y 2 1 y s i 1 s n i f i k 1 s i 1 i k s n i f i 8 s t i 1 s n i c i c f j c j p c i 1 2 s eq 7 represent the average of competitive abilities of all the species in the model eqs 7 and 8 therefore the harmonic mean maximum is achieved using the evolutionarily stable strategy and eq 6 is the interaction strength of competition in the community which is the comprehensive effect of interactions among species antagonism and mutualism as they evolve and adapt 3 results two results were generated from our model for the general case fig 1 the first was that species interactions can be used to derive density dependent laws for every species according to the limiting factor fi y1 y2 ys eq 6 can be rewritten as eq 9 as follows 9 fi y1 y2 ys 1 ni fi 1 n1 f1 1 n2 f2 1 ns fs qi qi ni where 10 q i 1 f i j 1 j i s 1 n j f j 1 s 1 c i s 1 j 1 j i s n j c j eq 9 embodies the reciprocal yield law f n n n q first proposed by shinozaki and kira 1956 where q is the carrying capacity of the system n is the number of individuals of one species and qi is the carrying capacity of the system for the ith species or the maximum density of adults of the ith species that the environment can support eq 9 is also an intraspecific interaction law the carrying capacity of the environment is determined by the amount of resources we observed that the density dependent laws of all species produced by the interaction strengths of the communities eq 9 are similar to the reciprocal yield law in addition when the total consumption of other species remained unchanged the larger the difference among the consumption of these species the smaller was the harmonic mean of other species consumption of resources thereby resulting in a larger carrying capacity for the ith species the reciprocal yield law is one of the most important density dependent laws within a species and is a component of the population theory accordingly eq 9 demonstrates that the interactions of a species in a community can be used to derive density dependent laws for all species in that community thereby providing a link between the population theory and the community diversity theory the second result generated by the model was that when densities of different species change for resources utilization according to eqs 7 and 8 the maximum ability to occupy the blank plaque the competitive abilities of community y can be calculated using the lagrange method under conditions of evolutionary stability as follows 11 y cp s2 12 s s i 1 s 1 y i c p when all species in a community are in an evolutionarily stable coexistence and the competitive abilities of community was maximum the product of the harmonic mean of the fitness of all species s i 1 s 1 y i s y and the community richness is equal to the product of the total amount of minimal restriction resources and the resources utilization efficiency of the community in theory see eq 12 once an ecologically stable community is formed the main goal of the community was maintaining the competitive abilities of community by regulated the number of species and to maximize the resources utilization efficiency of the community thus 13 s p s sla c sy where y can be seen as constant we considered water as the minimal restriction resource in this study and c ac1 b where c1 is the annual precipitation during growth stage a and b are constants we thus have a simple relation from eq 13 namely 14 s2 sla ac1 b where a and b were the fitting constants with a a y and b b y globally community biodiversity has decreased over the recent decades because of climate change we validated the model using data published on the pnas harrison et al 2015 the experiment is briefly introduced as follows in a california grassland plant diversity declined between 2000 and 2014 on the landscape scale 27 km² across multiple functional groups and soil environments serpentine and non serpentine soil the study took place at the university of california mclaughlin reserve a 2 776 ha facility at 366 914 m elevation in the inner north coast range n 38 52 w 122 26 the climate is mediterranean with mean annual temperatures of 8 c in january and 25 c in july and mean annual rainfall of 62 cm falling mainly in oct apr substrates include fertile soils derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks and infertile mg rich and nutrient poor soils derived from serpentine rock grasslands are dominated by annual species primarily native and exotic annual forbs nongrasses that flower in april july in addition to approximately 10 species of exotic eurasian annual grasses that flower in may jun species composition was sampled annually in april and june in the paper the most important finding was climate driven directional loss of species diversity in ecological communities in a natural nonexperimental setting harrison et al 2015 which was very similar to eq 14 we tested eq 14 by analysing published data including the precipitation during the growth stages c1 the species richness s and the average sla of grassland species in the community the results indicate that our model can explain the changes in diversity as seen in the data from observations over the 15 years fig 2 which also tested eq 13 once an ecologically stable community is formed the main goal of the community was maintaining the competitive abilities of community 4 discussion a new interactions strength was developed which predicts the comprehensive effect of interactions both antagonism and mutualism among species as they evolve and adapt interactions between species are highly complex and have been studied both experimentally and theoretically wootton and emmerson 2005 wells and o hara 2013 benkman 2013 such interactions can be between pairs abrams 2001 wootton and emmerson 2005 among multiple species mougi and kondoh 2012 based on the competition for resources or niches fort 2015 or in the form of an interaction net wells and o hara 2013 benkman 2013 however accurate descriptions of interactions between species in plant communities are hard to find our approach began with the ultimate state of community evolution and made full use of the conditions of evolutionarily stable coexistence so avoiding complex processes and factors we summed up the quantitative relationships between community richness and the harmonic mean of the fitness of all species based on an accurate description of interactions among species in a plant community see eq 12 species diversity is closely related to community stability and the harmonic mean of the fitness of all species is closely linked to community function thus our model has enriched the literature on the relations between community stability and community function the results seen in fig 2 are consistent with the predictions of our model indicating that eqs 6 and 7 can be used also in more general cases we observed that density dependent laws exist for all species at the population level and govern interaction strengths of communities which in turn are similar to the reciprocal yield law intraspecific interaction strength there is more information in the maximum density of adults in the ith species reciprocal yield laws of a single species can be extrapolated from the community interactions strength although several earlier studies have explored the theoretical and experimental applications of the reciprocal yield law shinozaki and kira 1956 han et al 2014 the present model based on the theories of community and evolutionary stability is entirely new our work offers a novel unification theory in which interspecific and intraspecific interactions strengths are unified in the process of competition for resources this reunification helps us to understand the role of intraspecific interactions in the formation and maintenance of communities zengler and palsson 2012 we have uncovered a function for the harmonic mean of fitness for all species and when the average of competitive abilities of all species reaches its maximum value this function reflects the total amount of minimal restriction resources and the resource utilization efficiency of the community we discovered that once the ability of different species in a community to occupy any blank plaque reaches its maximum the product of the harmonic mean of the fitness of all species and species richness is equal to the product of the total amount of minimal restriction resources and the resources utilization efficiency of the community thus the total amount of minimal restriction resources and the resource utilization efficiency of the community are inversely related for the same total amount of resources and the same level of resource utilization efficiency of the community greater species diversity lowers the community productivity which sets an upper limit for plant diversity this result also explains the differences in the results of trade offs related to diversity and the harmonic mean of the fitness of all species between natural and artificial communities of plants mccann 2000 because natural communities need to increase their species diversity to improve their stability however maximum fitness is often the most important goal of an artificial plant community a crop therefore the stability of such a community is lower than that of a natural plant community and stability is necessary for maintaining artificial environments the applications of the competitive ability model equation and the community interaction strength require further verification although the evolutionarily stable theory has uncovered the extraordinary ecological significance of the harmonic mean more important the harmonic mean maximum is evolutionarily stable species composition with different distribution frequencies in a community is the basis of community stability therefore a species with low frequency distribution always plays an important part in community stability currently climate change has profound impacts on biodiversity among the components of climate change the effect of changes in precipitation is the largest knapp et al 2008 craine et al 2012 harrison et al 2015 it is necessary to propose a model that can predict the impact of climate change on biodiversity in the present study although the plant diversity model was derived based on an ecological stable community the model s predictions corresponded closely to the observed variability in plant diversity the model is similar to the model of island geography based on the stable community which was used for planning protected areas to conserve endangered
