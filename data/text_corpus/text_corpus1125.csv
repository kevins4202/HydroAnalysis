5625,stable isotopes are useful for obtaining hydroclimatic and past environmental information the record of stable isotopes in snow not only reflects the deposition condition but also provides information on post depositional processes which benefits ice core studies in this study δ 18o and δd in new snow surface snow and snowpack were measured to analyze deposited and post depositional processes on a temperate glacier at the southeast margin of the tibetan plateau the results indicated that new snow and surface snow were relatively depleted in heavy isotopes during the post monsoon period and enriched in heavy isotopes during the westerly and pre monsoon period surface snow was enriched in 18o and d relative to new snow sampled during the same period isotopic homogenization was observed in may and june snowpack illustrating the effect of melting on isotopes the relatively low slope 8 for the δd δ 18o line during the post monsoon period and high slope 8 during the westerly and pre monsoon periods corresponded to temperature change although the vertical isotopic composition of snowpack sampled in april recorded the deposited information of winter precipitation the post depositional processes could have altered the isotopic composition of snow during the accumulation period wind drift was an crucial factor leading to abrupt isotopic modification in snow which was verified using the energy balance model and wind regime during the ablation period the decreasing trend of the slope and the gradual enrichment of 18o and d in the leaving snow mainly resulted from the isotopic exchange between liquid and solid water the study enhanced our understanding of the controlling post depositional processes on temperate glaciers keywords stable isotopes post depositional processes snow temperate glacier tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau which is called the third pole of the earth has many alpine glaciers these glaciers are becoming increasingly important not only because they represent water resources but also provide the opportunity of reconstructing the environmental history zhou et al 2010 muhammad and tian 2016 yulong snow mountain mt yulong located in the southeast margin of the tibetan plateau is the nearest glacial region to the equator in mainland eurasia this region has 13 temperate glaciers of which six have disappeared du et al 2013 thus causing changes to the local water cycle he et al 2010 pu et al 2013a 2017 the snow accumulated on mt yulong is a crucial water source for lijiang city located 25 km north of mt yulong investigating the deposited and post depositional processes of snow on mt yulong is crucial for glacial hydrology against the background of global warming climate change and glacier retreat stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are increasingly used as proxies to determine hydrological pathways and reconstruct environmental signals in glacial regions stichler and schotterer 2000 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 yang et al 2013 landais et al 2015 shao et al 2017 oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation are closely associated with climatic and environmental variables e g dansgaard 1964 kong et al 2013 rao et al 2016 whereas post depositional processes play a key role in the isotopic modification from deposited snow to meltwater e g taylor et al 2001 feng et al 2002 in particular stable isotopes in snowpack records not only reflect the conditions of atmospheric deposition but are also important for understanding glacial processes and reconstructing past hydroclimatic parameters zhou et al 2008a b zhou et al 2014 although many investigators have used the variable isotopic signatures of glacier snow precipitation river water and groundwater to answer complex hydrological questions e g yang et al 2013 dahlke et al 2014 kong and pang 2012 2016 detailed studies targeting the isotopic modification influenced by post depositional processes are primarily required to improve our understanding of snow metamorphism processes and the driving factors related to the isotopic consistencies and inconsistencies several studies have been proposed in the mt yulong region using the stable isotopic composition in water for instance pang et al 2007 suggested that a firn profile of baishui glacier no 1 can provide a valuable record of past variations of the indian monsoon a 10 10 m firn core has been used to reconstruct climatic records he et al 2002 stable isotope compositions in snow precipitation and glacier fed river water have been widely studied in past years he et al 2006 pang et al 2006 li et al 2009 pu et al 2013a b however the post depositional processes occurred during different periods still remain unclear the use of the isotopic composition of snow for obtaining information on post depositional processes needs to be further investigated in this study we measured the δ 18o and δd values in new snow surface snow and snowpack with the following objectives 1 to characterize the δ 18o and δd in new snow surface snow and snowpack and determine their variation and 2 to investigate the driving post depositional processes on isotopic modification during different periods the results are expected to enhance our understanding of post depositional processes on temperate glaciers which would benefit ice core studies 2 study area the hengduan mountains lie in the southeastern part of the tibetan plateau and consist of a series of mountain ranges yulong snow mountain 27 10 n 100 15 e located in the southern part of the hengduan mountains covers approximately 13 km from the west to east and 35 km from the south to north it is the southernmost glacial region in china with the highest peak measuring 5596 m the baishui catchment is on the eastern slope of mt yulong fig 1 six glaciers are present in the baishui drainage area among which baishui glacier no 1 is the largest glacier the elevation of the glacier front is approximately 4380 m and the elevation of the equilibrium line ela is approximately 4800 m where the total mean annual precipitation is 2000 mm the accumulation period normally is from october to april and the ablation period is from may to september du et al 2013 this area shows a distinct monsoon climate which is mainly controlled by the indian monsoon in the monsoon period from june to september and by the westerly system in the non monsoon period from october to may the non monsoon period generally includes the post monsoon period from october to november westerly period from december to april and pre monsoon period may meteorological parameters change in different seasons considering baishui glacier no 1 at 4500 m above sea level a s l in 2014 as an example the daily temperature ranged between 10 49 and 8 36 with a mean of 0 51 c fig 2 a april was a distinct month when the daily temperature changed from 0 c to 0 c whereas october was the month during which the daily temperature changed from 0 c to 0 c the monthly mean was 0 c from november to next april and 0 c from may to october the daily relative humidity in 2014 was 80 in the monsoon period and exhibited significant fluctuation in the non monsoon period fig 2b as shown in fig 2c the daily wind speed was low in the monsoon period and high in the non monsoon period with a large amplitude 3 sampling and methods 3 1 sampling and analyses in this study samples of new snow surface snow and snowpack were collected from baishui glacier no 1 as shown in fig 1 and table 1 four snowpacks were collected namely sp1 sampled on april 21 2012 sp2 sampled on may 3 2012 sp3 sampled on june 1 2014 and sp4 sampled on june 10 2014 every snowpit was sampled at 10 cm increments twelve new snow samples were collected in the post monsoon period october from baishui glacier no 1 at different altitudes in 2014 whereas five new snow samples were collected in the westerly and pre monsoon periods from january to may in 2014 new snow was taken in 24 h after snow deposited surface snow was sampled from baishui glacier no 1 at different altitudes in different periods may in 2012 and june november and december in 2014 new snow sampled at approximately 8 00 on october 30 2014 and surface snow sampled at approximately 14 00 on november 1 2014 were used to analyze post depositional processes during this specific period snow samples were collected in whirlpak polyethylene bags melted at room temperature and then transferred to 60 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles which were pre washed with ultra pure water then these samples were stored at 5 c before analysis the δd and δ 18o values were measured using a laser absorption water isotope spectrometer analyzer del 100 los gatos research in the key laboratory of western china s environmental systems ministry of education lanzhou university the results were expressed in the δ notation as differences in parts per thousand relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the measuring precision was 0 5 and 0 2 for δd and δ 18o respectively meteorological data were provided by yulong snow mountain glacier environmental observation and research station chinese academy of sciences an automatic weather station has been installed at 4500 m a s l near baishui glacier no 1 to observe meteorological changes in the ablation zone data on air temperature air pressure relative humidity water vapor pressure wind speed wind direction incoming and reflected shortwave solar radiation and incoming and outgoing longwave radiation were available for this study 3 2 energy balance model a surface energy balance model was initially established by fujita and ageta 2000 and used in subsequent studies zhang et al 2013 li et al 2018 the energy balance at the snow surface can be expressed as follows 1 q n q s q l q g q m 0 where qn is the net radiation qs is the turbulent sensible heat flux ql is the turbulent latent heat flux qg is the subsurface heat flux and qm is the heat flux for melting qg was neglected in this study because the previous studies on glacier energy balance in tibetan plateau have reported that the subsurface heat flux qg has a very minor percentage of the total heat flux and can almost be neglected yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 li et al 2018 qn can be calculated using the following equation 2 q n s in s out l in l out where sin and sout are the incoming and reflected shortwave radiation respectively and lin and lout are the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation respectively qs and ql can be calculated using the following equations 3 q s ρ v c p c s t t s 4 q l ρ v l f c l q q s where ρ is the local air density v is the wind speed and cp is the specific heat capacity of air t is the air temperature t s is the surface temperature q is the air specific humidity and q s is the specific humidity at the surface lf is the latent heat of evaporation 2 514 106 j kg or sublimation 2 849 106 j kg constant bulk exchange coefficient cs for sensible heat and cl for latent heat are equal to 0 002 kondo and yamazawa 1986 ts can be calculated from lout oerlemans and klok 2002 the heat flux for melting qm can be estimated according to the above energy balance model when the meteorological data including air temperature air pressure water vapor pressure wind speed wind direction incoming and reflected shortwave solar radiation incoming and outgoing longwave radiation are available then the water equivalent of melting and sublimation during the observation period are calculated by the following equations 5 m q m l m ρ w 6 m s q l l v ρ w where m is the melting amount and ms is the amount of sublimation lm is the latent heat of fusion 3 34 105 j kg lv is the latent heat of evaporation or sublimation hock 2005 3 3 isotopic modeling studies indicate that the process of sublimation evaporation and melting refreezing follow the model of rayleigh fractionation which is usually expressed as dansgaard 1964 jouzel and souchez 1982 7 r r 0 f α 1 where r0 is the initial isotope in the reactant and r is the ratio in the reactant when a fraction f remains α represents the fractionation factor from the product to reactant equation 5 can be expressed in δ as follows 8 δ δ 0 1000 f α 1 1000 the isotopic composition δ 18o or δd based on the equation 6 and then the slope of δd δ 18o could be calculated as for the melting refreezing process the equilibrium fractionation factor for d αdice water and 18o α18oice water at 0 c is assumed to be 1 0186 and 1 003 respectively o neil 1968 for the sublimation process the fractionation factor is the sum of equilibrium fractionation factor and kinetic fractionation factor because both equilibrium fractionation and kinetic fractionation occur during the process gustafson et al 2010 kong et al 2019a the equilibrium fractionation factor for oxygen and hydrogen is calculated from temperature majoube 1971 the kinetic fractionation factor can be calculated from the relative humidity at the snow atmosphere boundary gonfiantini 1986 clark and fritz 1997 4 results 4 1 isotopic composition the δ 18o δd and d excess of new snow and surface snow are shown in table 2 first the temporally changing trend of isotopic composition was comparable for new snow and surface snow both new snow and surface snow were depleted in heavy isotopes during the post monsoon period and enriched in heavy isotopes during the pre monsoon period this suggested that new snow was a crucial factor influencing the isotopic composition of surface snow second surface snow showed less negative values of δ 18o and δd relative to new snow sampled during the same period which may be due to post depositional processes occurring on surface snow additionally the altitudinal pattern of δ 18o and δd values in surface snow was complex the varying trend with altitude was reversed for the δ 18o and δd values of surface snow sampled on may 3 2012 and june 10 2014 whereas no obvious altitude effect was observed for surface snow of december 2014 fig 3 distinct isotopic variations were observed in the vertical profile of snow from april to june table 3 fig 4 as shown in table 3 the depth of snowpack deceased gradually with time from april which suggested a gradual melting of snowpack however the δ 18o and δd values as well as their vertical pattern exhibited the following changes 1 isotopic homogenization occurred in may and june the largest amplitude of δ 18o and δd was observed in the profile of sp1 sampled in april 2012 whereas the smallest variation was observed in sp3 and sp4 sampled in june 2014 2 the d excess decreased when δd or δ18o increased or vice versa for the two snow profiles sampled in 2012 sp1 and sp2 however similar variation trends in δd δ 18o and d excess were observed in the snowpits sampled in june 2014 sp3 and sp4 compared with snowpits sampled in 2000 pang et al 2006 snow layers in 2012 and 2014 exhibited more obvious isotopic homogenization this can be attributed to the increase in temperature in the glacial region xin et al 2013 which resulted in the rapid decrease in snow depths as well as isotopic homogenization li et al 2015 reported that snow layers at the shiyi glacier undergo intense melting in july and august resulting in the homogenization of δ 18o however the homogenization mainly occurred in may and june in this study indicating that temperate glaciers including baishui glacier no 1 experience intense melting before or at the beginning of summer 4 2 slope of δd δ 18o lines two features could be observed for the relationship of δd δ 18o in snow table 4 first snow during the post monsoon period exhibited a slope of 8 0 whereas snow during the westerly and pre monsoon periods exhibited a slope of 8 0 during the post monsoon period the slope 7 97 of new snow sampled on october 30 2014 was close to that of the global meteoric water line 8 0 the slope of surface snow sampled on november 1 was 7 34 and it decreased to 7 26 on december 1 2014 during the westerly and pre monsoon periods a high slope 8 was observed for the sampled surface snow and snowpacks another feature was that post depositional processes might have occurred which altered the values of δd and δ 18o as well as the relationship of δd δ 18o the difference in the slope for new snow and surface snow sampled during the same period proved this besides the slope gradually decreased during the pre monsoon period when snow melted the slope of surface snow was 9 39 in may which decreased to 8 86 in june the slope for the four snowpits ranged from 8 40 to 9 30 with a mean value of 8 51 the δd δ 18o regression line for sp4 was below the line for sp3 likewise a similar pattern of decrease in the slope was observed in sp2 and sp1 the decreasing trend in the slope and the progressive enrichment of 18o and d in the leaving snow should be considered the result of the melting process 5 discussion 5 1 information on winter precipitation recorded in the snowpack new snow was reported to be depleted in heavy isotopes during the post monsoon period but enriched in heavy isotopes during the westerly and pre monsoon periods the isotopic modification in new snow can be attributed to water vapor sources fig 5 suggested that the study area was mainly controlled by the westerlies during this period vapor from the westerlies was relatively enriched in heavy isotopes relative to monsoon vapor yu et al 2017 hence new snow showed enrichment of heavy isotopes relative to monsoon precipitation yu et al 2017 in addition winter precipitation was expected to be from local recycling vapor previous study showed that the content of 18o and d in surface water during the post monsoon period was depleted because of the recharge of monsoon rainwater during the monsoon in mt yulong after the retreat of the asian monsoon the surface water was still relatively depleted in 18o and d during the post monsoon period pu et al 2017 accordingly vapor that had evaporated from the local surface water was more depleted in heavy isotopes resulting in low values of δ 18o and δd in precipitation during the post monsoon period moreover the δ 18o and δd values of surface water showed an increasing trend during the non monsoon period and were particularly high during the pre monsoon period pu et al 2017 therefore vapor from the local recycling processes was enriched in 18o and d during the pre monsoon period resulting in the enrichment of heavy isotopes in precipitation the slope of 8 during the post monsoon period and of 8 during the westerly and pre monsoon periods can be attributed to the change in temperature according to rayleigh fractionation theory wang et al 2009 the slope s is determined by the fractionation factors of 18o α18 o and d αd s αd 1 α18 o 1 which are closely associated with temperature and humidity wu et al 2016 suggested that the slope in snow showed an increasing trend with a decrease in temperature in glacial regions the daily temperature at 4500 m on mt yulong was sometimes 0 c in october and decreased gradually from october to march fig 2a the relatively low slope at the beginning of the accumulation period post monsoon period corresponded to the relatively high temperature whereas the slope of 8 0 in the snow during the westerly period corresponded to the lower temperature high slopes of 8 in snow have also been reported by many studies in the tibetan plateau zhou et al 2014 reported a slope in the range of 8 5 9 3 from the initial precipitation to the melt impacted firnpack in an alpine catchment located in the central tibetan plateau wu et al 2016 also observed a high slope 8 in snow sampled from laohugou glacier no 12 which is located at the northern edge of the tibetan plateau snowpacks are usually regarded as records of winter precipitation kendall and mcdonnell 1999 the vertical isotopic composition of sp1 sampled at the end of the accumulation period was studied to examine the relationship between snowpack and winter precipitation sp1 was separated into two parts the lower snow part 0 200 cm depleted in 18o and d and the upper snow part 200 cm the snow surface enriched in 18o and d the mean value of δ 18o increased by 10 3 for δ 18o and 92 0 for δ 18o δd from the lower part to the upper part moreover the lower part of sp1showed a slope of 7 54 which was close to that of surface snow collected in the post monsoon period the upper layer of sp1 showed a high slope 8 which was also observed for surface snow sampled in the westerly and pre monsoon periods in summary the distinct vertical variation in isotopes and slope in snow profiles was consistent with the overall temporal varying trend of winter precipitation during the non monsoon period low during the post monsoon and high in the subsequent period thus verifying that the vertical isotopic variation in snowpack at the end of the accumulation period can be regarded as a record of winter precipitation the snow in the lower part was mainly deposited during the post monsoon period when new snow showed negative values of δ 18o and δd and a relatively low slope the snow in the upper part was mainly deposited during the westerly and pre monsoon periods with less negative values of δ 18o and δd and a relatively high slope nevertheless isotopic homogenization and the change in the slope indicated that seasonal isotopic signals in snow layers were altered by post depositional processes particularly in the ablation period 5 2 controlling processes on isotopic modification during the accumulation period although snowpacks are regarded as a record of winter precipitation numerous post depositional processes such as wind drift melting and refreezing sublimation and evaporation condensation or diffusion can often obscure the seasonal isotopic signals in the snow layers jouzel and souchez 1982 during the accumulation period the isotopic composition of snow can be affected by multiple potential factors first evaporation and sublimation or condensation at the snow surface could change the isotope content in the upper snow layers sublimation has been reported to affect only a depth of approximately 5 10 cm even under extremely dry environmental conditions whereas the effect of sublimation is limited in mountainous regions with maritime climate stichler et al 2001 storck et al 2002 sublimation may occur in regions with low accumulation rates and it may be pronounced in dry seasons and or under conditions of low relative humidity but it exerts a minor influence during the melting season when solar radiation causes relatively intensive melting at the snow surface gustafson et al 2010 lee et al 2010a zhou et al 2014 the mt yulong region is characterized by temperate and humid climate therefore sublimation is less significant in the region than in those with drier climates second partial melting and refreezing are potential depositional processes resulting in isotopic fractionation at the beginning of the accumulation period fig 2a showed that the daily temperature might sometimes be 0 c even in december and november although snow accumulation may have begun since october in the case of temperatures 0 c a part of snow can melt and then refreezing may occur when the temperature decreases abruptly in the night therefore partial melting refreezing could have occurred at the beginning of the accumulation period third wind drift could change the spatial variation of δ 18o and δd in the snow niewodniczaeski et al 1981 li et al 2015 glacial regions are usually exposed to strong winds in this study the wind speed was particularly high during the winter when the climate was dry fig 2c thus the wind may have been a crucial factor in the region and may have been involved in moving snow from its original place of deposition to other places and in altering the spatial distribution of isotopes in snow fourth isotope exchange between solid phase snow and atmospheric water vapor may alter the isotopic composition of surface snow the exchange between surface snow and atmospheric water vapor generally results in the increase of slop by increasing the d content of snow relative to the increase in 18o content ingraham and criss 1993 earman et al 2006 when a temperature gradient during dry metamorphism is available near the snow surface vapor can be transported through the snow layers and cause ice vapor exchange lee et al 2010a lastly diffusion dispersion is a possible process according to smoothing the initial isotopic stratigraphy of snowpack progressive smearing of isotopic profiles throughout the winter season have been reported confirming the influence of diffusion dispersion on isotope contents in snow profiles evans et al 2016 to explore the controlling post depositional processes during the accumulation period new snow sampled on october 30 2014 and surface snow sampled on november 1 2014 were studied in detail the δ 18o values of surface snow sampled on december 1 2014 ranged between 20 8 and 16 4 and the δd values ranged between 148 5 and 117 9 the average of δ 18o and δd decreased by 9 1 and 71 3 during the observation period from 8 00 on october 30 2014 to 14 00 on december 1 2014 the enrichment of heavy isotopes was not the result of the altitude effect which was 0 27 100 m on mt yulong in october as reported by he et al 2006 the decrease in the slope proved that post depositional processes could be a reason for the change in the isotope content in snow the model based on rayleigh fractionation introduced in section 3 3 was employed to examine the main post depositional processes it was assumed that the initial liquid water in snow corresponded to the intersection between the two lines of new snow and surface snow the δi d and δi 18o of initial water was equal to 19 7 and 139 8 thus the model results suggested that the slope of the melting refreezing process was 5 38 and the values of δd and δ 18o in snow would decrease with the increase of water frozen fraction fig 6 the modeling slope was 6 24 for the sublimation process heavy isotopes were enriched in residual snow with the increase of water sublimated fraction both of the sublimation line and melting refreezing line were lower than the regional meteoric water line rmwl of the tibetan plateau kong et al 2019b the slope of surface snow 7 47 was higher than the slope of the sublimation process and the melting refreezing process furthermore the points representing surface snow were located on the right side above the melting refreezing line and sublimation line suggesting that both melting refreezing and sublimation were not the main factors resulting in the enrichment of heavy isotopes in surface snow sampled on november 1 2014 the surface energy balance model demonstrated in section 3 2 was employed to examine the energy budget ten minute meteorological data was used to force the model the amount of melting and sublimation was then quantified based on equation 5 and 6 respectively the modeling results indicated that the radiation heat flux qn was the most crucial component of heat flux accounting for 80 0 of the total surface heat flux the sensible heat flux qs and latent heat flux ql accounted for 19 3 and 0 7 respectively most of the incoming shortwave radiation sin was reflected because of high albedo after new snow deposited on october 29 2014 the calculated results showed that the amount of snow underwent sublimation ms and melting m was only 0 005 mm and 3 5 mm respectively this proved that both sublimation and refreezing melting process exerted only a minor effect on the isotope content in snow during this period overall the sublimation and or evaporation and refreezing melting process were not controlling factors during the observation period furthermore isotopic exchange between the snow and atmospheric water vapor was considered to be minor because the observed slope decreased rather than increased diffusion and dispersion would not lead to significant enrichment of heavy isotopes therefore wind may be the controlling factor to observe the effect of wind on the isotopic modification of snow the wind speed and wind direction during the observation period were analyzed fig 7 the wind speed ranged between 1 4 m s and 13 7 m s with an average value of 5 7 m s the chart of the wind roses showed that most of the wind flowed from the northeast and east with a frequency of 66 6 the next prevailing wind direction was from southeast with a frequency of 11 1 this indicated that the up valley wind dominated the study area during the sampling period in general the δ 18o and δd values in the snow were found to decrease with an increase in altitude he et al 2006 yao et al 2013 the prevailing up valley wind could move the snow from low altitudes with relatively enriched δ 18o and δd to high altitudes resulting in the enrichment of heavy isotopes in snow located at high altitudes in addition the insignificant decreasing trend for δ 18o and δd with altitude in snow sampled on 30 october 2014 can also be attributed to wind drift the wind speed ranging between 0 3 and 4 8 m s was low between 0 00 and 12 00 and was 2 m s in most of the remaining time on october 29 when the snow was deposited new snow with a low density can be moved by wind which changed the spatial redistribution of 18o and d in snow 5 3 controlling processes on isotopic modification during the ablation period during the ablation period a decreasing trend of the slope and the gradual enrichment of 18o and d in the leaving snow were observed which were considered to be the result of the melting process isotopic homogenization occurred at the depth of 150 250 cm above the glacier surface in may snowpack and almost the whole vertical profile in june snowpack indicating the effects of melting on the isotopic composition of snow this was because the daily temperature was 0 c during the latter half of april resulting in the melting of snow fig 2a as the temperature increased gradually in may and june the melting rate increased and large amounts of meltwater were generated the meltwater generated at the snow surface percolated from the surface to snow layers below taylor et al 2001 during this process isotopic exchange occurred between liquid water and ice causing isotopic redistribution of both oxygen and hydrogen isotopes nakawo et al 1993 lee et al 2009 2010a taylor et al 2001 2002 and feng et al 2002 have presented a physically based one dimensional model to describe stable isotopic exchanges between snow and liquid water their studies have indicated that liquid water may become relatively depleted in 18o relative to ice because the δ 18o value is 3 1 lower than that of the ice at equilibrium consequently heavy isotopes tend to exit in the leaving snow resulting in the enrichment of 18o and d in snow nakawo et al 1993 taylor et al 2001 feng et al 2002 lee et al 2010a snow properties such as grain size distribution porosity permeability and wetness as well as the rate of melting would determine the effectiveness of isotopic exchange and the fraction of ice in the ice water isotopic exchange system and would then determine the range of the isotope contents in snow and meltwater feng et al 2002 hence the extent of enrichment of 18o and d differed between snowpacks isotopic exchange has been reported to be controlled by ice liquid water equilibrium fractionation factors of 3 1 and 19 5 for oxygen and hydrogen respectively thus suggesting a slope of 8 close to 19 5 3 1 6 3 for the δ18o and δd values of snowmelt o neil 1968 lee et al 2009 2010a this process not only led to a decrease in the δd δ 18o slope from snow to snowmelt but also resulted in a decrease in the slope in snow profiles with an increasing rate of melting which was observed in this study similar evolution of the δd δ 18o slope has been observed by several studies a slope change of 0 8 from 10 4 to 8 7 from june to july was observed in snowpit at zhadang glacier in the central tibetan plateau zhou et al 2014 whereas a slope change of 1 7 from 10 4 to 8 7 from june to july was observed at the qiyi glacier located at the northeast edge of the tibetan plateau zhou et al 2008a lee et al 2010a showed a decreasing trend in the slope the descending order was as follows new snow snow profiles snow melt gurney and lawrence 2004 observed that the slope of δd δ 18o for a snowpit decreased from april to august from 7 5 to 6 2 which was mainly the result of evaporation of liquid water within the snowpit a best fit line for meltwater with a slope of 4 4 was also suggested however in the meltwater the δd δ 18o slope does not always decrease from 8 to the theoretical value of 6 3 gurney and lawrence 2004 notably the bulk effect of both snowpit melting and refreezing on the d excess of a snow layer was not uniform the situation was complicated by the initial d excess values and the heterogeneity of snowpits which was consistent with the report that the d excess changes associated with refreezing of a melted snow layer may decrease or increase depending on the difference between the isotopic compositions of the liquid and solid phases prior to refreezing zhou et al 2008a 2014 rainfall is another possible factor influencing the vertical isotope profiles as well as the isotopic composition of snow meltwater when air temperature is higher than 2 c in glacial region precipitation usually falls as rain accelerating the melting of glacier and snow because of the energy supplied by rainfall van et al 2016 lee et al 2010b confirmed the effect of rainfall on the isotopic composition of a snowpack according to artificial rain on snow experiments rainfall does occur in june when temperature is relatively high in mt yulong region xin et al 2013 the influence of rainfall on isotope content of snowpack in mt yulong region was examined considering sp3 sampled on june 1 and sp4 sampled on june 10 for example overall the rainfall exerted minor effect on the isotopic evolution of snowpack in this study because firstly both precipitation and snow melting occurred during the observation days june 1 to june 10 about 55 cm depth of snow 26 9 cm snow water equivalent had melted whereas only 5 2 cm of rain fell near the sampling site the amount of rain was little relative to melt water indicating that the melting process should be the main process controlling the isotopic evolution of snowpack secondly the average density of sp3 was relatively high 0 49 g cm3 the firn with high density would prevent rainfall from infiltrating into the snow layers moreover the rainfall was usually concentrated with short duration most of rainfall flows directly over the surface of snow or be discharged into the glacier according to englacial drainage conduits fountain and walder 1998 as a result only a little rainfall can percolate through the upper snow layers thirdly the vertical isotopic evolution of snowpack did not support the influence of rainfall if rainfall can percolate down the snow layers isotopic exchange between liquid and solid water would occur resulting in heavy isotope enrichment in the leaving snow lee et al 2010b nevertheless the upper 10 cm of sp4 was relatively depleted in heavy isotopes δ18o 8 8 relative to the same depth of sp3 δ18o 6 7 this confirmed that the effect of rainfall on vertical isotope profiles was minor in this study 6 conclusion new snow was relatively depleted in heavy isotopes during the post monsoon period but enriched in heavy isotopes during the pre monsoon period the temporally changing trend of the isotopic composition of surface snow was similar to that of new snow during the non monsoon period surface snow was enriched in 18o and d relative to new snow sampled during the same period due to post depositional processes distinct variations were noted from april to june for the snowpack depth and the vertical isotopic composition of snowpacks isotopic homogenization occurred under the influence of snow melting the slope of the δ 18o δd line was 8 during the post monsoon period and was 8 during the westerly and pre monsoon periods and this variation can be attributed to changes in temperature post depositional processes may also alter the slope of the δ 18o δd line in snow the isotopic composition of new snow was closely related to water vapor sources whereas the vertical isotopic variation of snowpack sampled at the end of accumulation period reflected winter precipitation moreover the seasonal isotopic signals in snow layers were obscured by post depositional processes particularly in the ablation period isotopic analysis and the energy balance model demonstrated that partial melting refreezing occurred at the beginning of the accumulation period but this process exerted a minor influence on the isotopic composition of snow sublimation or evaporation can almost be neglected wind drift was the most crucial factor during the accumulation period altering the isotopic composition of snow in addition the melting process was the most crucial post depositional process leading to the isotopic modification of snow during the ablation period the decreasing trend of slope and the gradual enrichment of 18o and d in the leaving snow mainly resulted from isotopic exchange between liquid water and snow during the melting process this study is expected to benefit our understanding of post depositional processes of snow on temperate glaciers and provide a reference for investigating the depositional and post

5625,stable isotopes are useful for obtaining hydroclimatic and past environmental information the record of stable isotopes in snow not only reflects the deposition condition but also provides information on post depositional processes which benefits ice core studies in this study δ 18o and δd in new snow surface snow and snowpack were measured to analyze deposited and post depositional processes on a temperate glacier at the southeast margin of the tibetan plateau the results indicated that new snow and surface snow were relatively depleted in heavy isotopes during the post monsoon period and enriched in heavy isotopes during the westerly and pre monsoon period surface snow was enriched in 18o and d relative to new snow sampled during the same period isotopic homogenization was observed in may and june snowpack illustrating the effect of melting on isotopes the relatively low slope 8 for the δd δ 18o line during the post monsoon period and high slope 8 during the westerly and pre monsoon periods corresponded to temperature change although the vertical isotopic composition of snowpack sampled in april recorded the deposited information of winter precipitation the post depositional processes could have altered the isotopic composition of snow during the accumulation period wind drift was an crucial factor leading to abrupt isotopic modification in snow which was verified using the energy balance model and wind regime during the ablation period the decreasing trend of the slope and the gradual enrichment of 18o and d in the leaving snow mainly resulted from the isotopic exchange between liquid and solid water the study enhanced our understanding of the controlling post depositional processes on temperate glaciers keywords stable isotopes post depositional processes snow temperate glacier tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau which is called the third pole of the earth has many alpine glaciers these glaciers are becoming increasingly important not only because they represent water resources but also provide the opportunity of reconstructing the environmental history zhou et al 2010 muhammad and tian 2016 yulong snow mountain mt yulong located in the southeast margin of the tibetan plateau is the nearest glacial region to the equator in mainland eurasia this region has 13 temperate glaciers of which six have disappeared du et al 2013 thus causing changes to the local water cycle he et al 2010 pu et al 2013a 2017 the snow accumulated on mt yulong is a crucial water source for lijiang city located 25 km north of mt yulong investigating the deposited and post depositional processes of snow on mt yulong is crucial for glacial hydrology against the background of global warming climate change and glacier retreat stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are increasingly used as proxies to determine hydrological pathways and reconstruct environmental signals in glacial regions stichler and schotterer 2000

complex hydrological questions e g yang et al 2013 dahlke et al 2014 kong and pang 2012 2016 detailed studies targeting the isotopic modification influenced by post depositional processes are primarily required to improve our understanding of snow metamorphism processes and the driving factors related to the isotopic consistencies and inconsistencies several studies have been proposed in the mt yulong region using the stable isotopic composition in water for instance pang et al 2007 suggested that a firn profile of baishui glacier no 1 can provide a valuable record of past variations of the indian monsoon a 10 10 m firn core has been used to reconstruct climatic records he et al 2002 stable isotope compositions in snow precipitation and glacier fed river water have been widely studied in past years he et al 2006 pang et al 2006 li et al 2009 pu et al 2013a b however the post depositional processes occurred during different periods still remain unclear the use of the isotopic composition of snow for obtaining information on post depositional processes needs to be further investigated in this study we measured the δ 18o and δd values in new snow surface snow and snowpack with the following objectives 1 to characterize the δ 18o and δd in new snow surface snow and snowpack and determine their variation and 2 to investigate the driving post depositional processes on isotopic modification during different periods the results are expected to enhance our understanding of post depositional processes on temperate glaciers which would benefit ice core studies 2 study area the hengduan mountains lie in the southeastern part of the tibetan plateau and consist of a series of mountain ranges yulong snow mountain 27 10 n 100 15 e located in the southern part of the hengduan mountains covers approximately 13 km from the west to east and 35 km from the south to north it is the southernmost glacial region in china with the highest peak measuring 5596 m the baishui catchment is on the eastern slope of mt yulong fig 1 six glaciers are present in the baishui drainage area among which baishui glacier no 1 is the largest glacier the elevation of the glacier front is approximately 4380 m and the elevation of the equilibrium line ela is approximately 4800 m where the total mean annual precipitation is 2000 mm the accumulation period normally is from october to april and the ablation period is from may to september du et al 2013 this area shows a distinct monsoon climate which is mainly controlled by the indian monsoon in the monsoon period from june to september and by the westerly system in the non monsoon period from october to may the non monsoon period generally includes the post monsoon period from october to november westerly period from december to april and pre monsoon period may meteorological parameters change in different seasons considering baishui glacier no 1 at 4500 m above sea level a s l in 2014 as an example the daily temperature ranged between 10 49 and 8 36 with a mean of 0 51 c fig 2 a april was a distinct month when the daily temperature changed from 0 c to 0 c whereas october was the month during which the daily temperature changed from 0 c to 0 c the monthly mean was 0 c from november to next april and 0 c from may to october the daily relative humidity in 2014 was 80 in the monsoon period and exhibited significant fluctuation in the non monsoon period fig 2b as shown in fig 2c the daily wind speed was low in the monsoon period and high in the non monsoon period with a large amplitude 3 sampling and methods 3 1 sampling and analyses in this study samples of new snow surface snow and snowpack were collected from baishui glacier no 1 as shown in fig 1 and table 1 four snowpacks were collected namely sp1 sampled on april 21 2012 sp2 sampled on may 3 2012 sp3 sampled on june 1 2014 and sp4 sampled on june 10 2014 every snowpit was sampled at 10 cm increments twelve new snow samples were collected in the post monsoon period october from baishui glacier no 1 at different altitudes in 2014 whereas five new snow samples were collected in the westerly and pre monsoon periods from january to may in 2014 new snow was taken in 24 h after snow deposited surface snow was sampled from baishui glacier no 1 at different altitudes in different periods may in 2012 and june november and december in 2014 new snow sampled at approximately 8 00 on october 30 2014 and surface snow sampled at approximately 14 00 on november 1 2014 were used to analyze post depositional processes during this specific period snow samples were collected in whirlpak polyethylene bags melted at room temperature and then transferred to 60 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles which were pre washed with ultra pure water then these samples were stored at 5 c before analysis the δd and δ 18o values were measured using a laser absorption water isotope spectrometer analyzer del 100 los gatos research in the key laboratory of western china s environmental systems ministry of education lanzhou university the results were expressed in the δ notation as differences in parts per thousand relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the measuring precision was 0 5 and 0 2 for δd and δ 18o respectively meteorological data were provided by yulong snow mountain glacier environmental observation and research station chinese academy of sciences an automatic weather station has been installed at 4500 m a s l near baishui glacier no 1 to observe meteorological changes in the ablation zone data on air temperature air pressure relative humidity water vapor pressure wind speed wind direction incoming and reflected shortwave solar radiation and incoming and outgoing longwave radiation were available for this study 3 2 energy balance model a surface energy balance model was initially established by fujita and ageta 2000 and used in subsequent studies zhang et al 2013 li et al 2018 the energy balance at the snow surface can be expressed as follows 1 q n q s q l q g q m 0 where qn is the net radiation qs is the turbulent sensible heat flux ql is the turbulent latent heat flux qg is the subsurface heat flux and qm is the heat flux for melting qg was neglected in this study because the previous studies on glacier energy balance in tibetan plateau have reported that the subsurface heat flux qg has a very minor percentage of the total heat flux and can almost be neglected yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 li et al 2018 qn can be calculated using the following equation 2 q n s in s out l in l out where sin and sout are the incoming and reflected shortwave radiation respectively and lin and lout are the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation respectively qs and ql can be calculated using the following equations 3 q s ρ v c p c s t t s 4 q l ρ v l f c l q q s where ρ is the local air density v is the wind speed and cp is the specific heat capacity of air t is the air temperature t s is the surface temperature q is the air specific humidity and q s is the specific humidity at the surface lf is the latent heat of evaporation 2 514 106 j kg or sublimation 2 849 106 j kg constant bulk exchange coefficient cs for sensible heat and cl for latent heat are equal to 0 002 kondo and yamazawa 1986 ts can be calculated from lout oerlemans and klok 2002 the heat flux for melting qm can be estimated according to the above energy balance model when the meteorological data including air temperature air pressure water vapor pressure wind speed wind direction incoming and reflected shortwave solar radiation incoming and outgoing longwave radiation are available then the water equivalent of melting and sublimation during the observation period are calculated by the following equations 5 m q m l m ρ w 6 m s q l l v ρ w where m is the melting amount and ms is the amount of sublimation lm is the latent heat of fusion 3 34 105 j kg lv is the latent heat of evaporation or sublimation hock 2005 3 3 isotopic modeling studies indicate that the process of sublimation evaporation and melting refreezing follow the model of rayleigh fractionation which is usually expressed as dansgaard 1964 jouzel and souchez 1982 7 r r 0 f α 1 where r0 is the initial isotope in the reactant and r is the ratio in the reactant when a fraction f remains α represents the fractionation factor from the product to reactant equation 5 can be expressed in δ as follows 8 δ δ 0 1000 f α 1 1000 the isotopic composition δ 18o or δd based on the equation 6 and then the slope of δd δ 18o could be calculated as for the melting refreezing process the equilibrium fractionation factor for d αdice water and 18o α18oice water at 0 c is assumed to be 1 0186 and 1 003 respectively o neil 1968 for the sublimation process the fractionation factor is the sum of equilibrium fractionation factor and kinetic fractionation factor because both equilibrium fractionation and kinetic fractionation occur during the process gustafson et al 2010 kong et al 2019a the equilibrium fractionation factor for oxygen and hydrogen is calculated from temperature majoube 1971 the kinetic fractionation factor can be calculated from the relative humidity at the snow atmosphere boundary gonfiantini 1986 clark and fritz 1997 4 results 4 1 isotopic composition the δ 18o δd and d excess of new snow and surface snow are shown in table 2 first the temporally changing trend of isotopic composition was comparable for new snow and surface snow both new snow and surface snow were depleted in heavy isotopes during the post monsoon period and enriched in heavy isotopes during the pre monsoon period this suggested that new snow was a crucial factor influencing the isotopic composition of surface snow second surface snow showed less negative values of δ 18o and δd relative to new snow sampled during the same period which may be due to post depositional processes occurring on surface snow additionally the altitudinal pattern of δ 18o and δd values in surface snow was complex the varying trend with altitude was reversed for the δ 18o and δd values of surface snow sampled on may 3 2012 and june 10 2014 whereas no obvious altitude effect was observed for surface snow of december 2014 fig 3 distinct isotopic variations were observed in the vertical profile of snow from april to june table 3 fig 4 as shown in table 3 the depth of snowpack deceased gradually with time from april which suggested a gradual melting of snowpack however the δ 18o and δd values as well as their vertical pattern exhibited the following changes 1 isotopic homogenization occurred in may and june the largest amplitude of δ 18o and δd was observed in the profile of sp1 sampled in april 2012 whereas the smallest variation was observed in sp3 and sp4 sampled in june 2014 2 the d excess decreased when δd or δ18o increased or vice versa for the two snow profiles sampled in 2012 sp1 and sp2 however similar variation trends in δd δ 18o and d excess were observed in the snowpits sampled in june 2014 sp3 and sp4 compared with snowpits sampled in 2000 pang et al 2006 snow layers in 2012 and 2014 exhibited more obvious isotopic homogenization this can be attributed to the increase in temperature in the glacial region xin et al 2013 which resulted in the rapid decrease in snow depths as well as isotopic homogenization li et al 2015 reported that snow layers at the shiyi glacier undergo intense melting in july and august resulting in the homogenization of δ 18o however the homogenization mainly occurred in may and june in this study indicating that temperate glaciers including baishui glacier no 1 experience intense melting before or at the beginning of summer 4 2 slope of δd δ 18o lines two features could be observed for the relationship of δd δ 18o in snow table 4 first snow during the post monsoon period exhibited a slope of 8 0 whereas snow during the westerly and pre monsoon periods exhibited a slope of 8 0 during the post monsoon period the slope 7 97 of new snow sampled on october 30 2014 was close to that of the global meteoric water line 8 0 the slope of surface snow sampled on november 1 was 7 34 and it decreased to 7 26 on december 1 2014 during the westerly and pre monsoon periods a high slope 8 was observed for the sampled surface snow and snowpacks another feature was that post depositional processes might have occurred which altered the values of δd and δ 18o as well as the relationship of δd δ 18o the difference in the slope for new snow and surface snow sampled during the same period proved this besides the slope gradually decreased during the pre monsoon period when snow melted the slope of surface snow was 9 39 in may which decreased to 8 86 in june the slope for the four snowpits ranged from 8 40 to 9 30 with a mean value of 8 51 the δd δ 18o regression line for sp4 was below the line for sp3 likewise a similar pattern of decrease in the slope was observed in sp2 and sp1 the decreasing trend in the slope and the progressive enrichment of 18o and d in the leaving snow should be considered the result of the melting process 5 discussion 5 1 information on winter precipitation recorded in the snowpack new snow was reported to be depleted in heavy isotopes during the post monsoon period but enriched in heavy isotopes during the westerly and pre monsoon periods the isotopic modification in new snow can be attributed to water vapor sources fig 5 suggested that the study area was mainly controlled by the westerlies during this period vapor from the westerlies was relatively enriched in heavy isotopes relative to monsoon vapor yu et al 2017 hence new snow showed enrichment of heavy isotopes relative to monsoon precipitation yu et al 2017 in addition winter precipitation was expected to be from local recycling vapor previous study showed that the content of 18o and d in surface water during the post monsoon period was depleted because of the recharge of monsoon rainwater during the monsoon in mt yulong after the retreat of the asian monsoon the surface water was still relatively depleted in 18o and d during the post monsoon period pu et al 2017 accordingly vapor that had evaporated from the local surface water was more depleted in heavy isotopes resulting in low values of δ 18o and δd in precipitation during the post monsoon period moreover the δ 18o and δd values of surface water showed an increasing trend during the non monsoon period and were particularly high during the pre monsoon period pu et al 2017 therefore vapor from the local recycling processes was enriched in 18o and d during the pre monsoon period resulting in the enrichment of heavy isotopes in precipitation the slope of 8 during the post monsoon period and of 8 during the westerly and pre monsoon periods can be attributed to the change in temperature according to rayleigh fractionation theory wang et al 2009 the slope s is determined by the fractionation factors of 18o α18 o and d αd s αd 1 α18 o 1 which are closely associated with temperature and humidity wu et al 2016 suggested that the slope in snow showed an increasing trend with a decrease in temperature in glacial regions the daily temperature at 4500 m on mt yulong was sometimes 0 c in october and decreased gradually from october to march fig 2a the relatively low slope at the beginning of the accumulation period post monsoon period corresponded to the relatively high temperature whereas the slope of 8 0 in the snow during the westerly period corresponded to the lower temperature high slopes of 8 in snow have also been reported by many studies in the tibetan plateau zhou et al 2014 reported a slope in the range of 8 5 9 3 from the initial precipitation to the melt impacted firnpack in an alpine catchment located in the central tibetan plateau wu et al 2016 also observed a high slope 8 in snow sampled from laohugou glacier no 12 which is located at the northern edge of the tibetan plateau snowpacks are usually regarded as records of winter precipitation kendall and mcdonnell 1999 the vertical isotopic composition of sp1 sampled at the end of the accumulation period was studied to examine the relationship between snowpack and winter precipitation sp1 was separated into two parts the lower snow part 0 200 cm depleted in 18o and d and the upper snow part 200 cm the snow surface enriched in 18o and d the mean value of δ 18o increased by 10 3 for δ 18o and 92 0 for δ 18o δd from the lower part to the upper part moreover the lower part of sp1showed a slope of 7 54 which was close to that of surface snow collected in the post monsoon period the upper layer of sp1 showed a high slope 8 which was also observed for surface snow sampled in the westerly and pre monsoon periods in summary the distinct vertical variation in isotopes and slope in snow profiles was consistent with the overall temporal varying trend of winter precipitation during the non monsoon period low during the post monsoon and high in the subsequent period thus verifying that the vertical isotopic variation in snowpack at the end of the accumulation period can be regarded as a record of winter precipitation the snow in the lower part was mainly deposited during the post monsoon period when new snow showed negative values of δ 18o and δd and a relatively low slope the snow in the upper part was mainly deposited during the westerly and pre monsoon periods with less negative values of δ 18o and δd and a relatively high slope nevertheless isotopic homogenization and the change in the slope indicated that seasonal isotopic signals in snow layers were altered by post depositional processes particularly in the ablation period 5 2 controlling processes on isotopic modification during the accumulation period although snowpacks are regarded as a record of winter precipitation numerous post depositional processes such as wind drift melting and refreezing sublimation and evaporation condensation or diffusion can often obscure the seasonal isotopic signals in the snow layers jouzel and souchez 1982 during the accumulation period the isotopic composition of snow can be affected by multiple potential factors first evaporation and sublimation or condensation at the snow surface could change the isotope content in the upper snow layers sublimation has been reported to affect only a depth of approximately 5 10 cm even under extremely dry environmental conditions whereas the effect of sublimation is limited in mountainous regions with maritime climate stichler et al 2001 storck et al 2002 sublimation may occur in regions with low accumulation rates and it may be pronounced in dry seasons and or under conditions of low relative humidity but it exerts a minor influence during the melting season when solar radiation causes relatively intensive melting at the snow surface gustafson et al 2010 lee et al 2010a zhou et al 2014 the mt yulong region is characterized by temperate and humid climate therefore sublimation is less significant in the region than in those with drier climates second partial melting and refreezing are potential depositional processes resulting in isotopic fractionation at the beginning of the accumulation period fig 2a showed that the daily temperature might sometimes be 0 c even in december and november although snow accumulation may have begun since october in the case of temperatures 0 c a part of snow can melt and then refreezing may occur when the temperature decreases abruptly in the night therefore partial melting refreezing could have occurred at the beginning of the accumulation period third wind drift could change the spatial variation of δ 18o and δd in the snow niewodniczaeski et al 1981 li et al 2015 glacial regions are usually exposed to strong winds in this study the wind speed was particularly high during the winter when the climate was dry fig 2c thus the wind may have been a crucial factor in the region and may have been involved in moving snow from its original place of deposition to other places and in altering the spatial distribution of isotopes in snow fourth isotope exchange between solid phase snow and atmospheric water vapor may alter the isotopic composition of surface snow the exchange between surface snow and atmospheric water vapor generally results in the increase of slop by increasing the d content of snow relative to the increase in 18o content ingraham and criss 1993 earman et al 2006 when a temperature gradient during dry metamorphism is available near the snow surface vapor can be transported through the snow layers and cause ice vapor exchange lee et al 2010a lastly diffusion dispersion is a possible process according to smoothing the initial isotopic stratigraphy of snowpack progressive smearing of isotopic profiles throughout the winter season have been reported confirming the influence of diffusion dispersion on isotope contents in snow profiles evans et al 2016 to explore the controlling post depositional processes during the accumulation period new snow sampled on october 30 2014 and surface snow sampled on november 1 2014 were studied in detail the δ 18o values of surface snow sampled on december 1 2014 ranged between 20 8 and 16 4 and the δd values ranged between 148 5 and 117 9 the average of δ 18o and δd decreased by 9 1 and 71 3 during the observation period from 8 00 on october 30 2014 to 14 00 on december 1 2014 the enrichment of heavy isotopes was not the result of the altitude effect which was 0 27 100 m on mt yulong in october as reported by he et al 2006 the decrease in the slope proved that post depositional processes could be a reason for the change in the isotope content in snow the model based on rayleigh fractionation introduced in section 3 3 was employed to examine the main post depositional processes it was assumed that the initial liquid water in snow corresponded to the intersection between the two lines of new snow and surface snow the δi d and δi 18o of initial water was equal to 19 7 and 139 8 thus the model results suggested that the slope of the melting refreezing process was 5 38 and the values of δd and δ 18o in snow would decrease with the increase of water frozen fraction fig 6 the modeling slope was 6 24 for the sublimation process heavy isotopes were enriched in residual snow with the increase of water sublimated fraction both of the sublimation line and melting refreezing line were lower than the regional meteoric water line rmwl of the tibetan plateau kong et al 2019b the slope of surface snow 7 47 was higher than the slope of the sublimation process and the melting refreezing process furthermore the points representing surface snow were located on the right side above the melting refreezing line and sublimation line suggesting that both melting refreezing and sublimation were not the main factors resulting in the enrichment of heavy isotopes in surface snow sampled on november 1 2014 the surface energy balance model demonstrated in section 3 2 was employed to examine the energy budget ten minute meteorological data was used to force the model the amount of melting and sublimation was then quantified based on equation 5 and 6 respectively the modeling results indicated that the radiation heat flux qn was the most crucial component of heat flux accounting for 80 0 of the total surface heat flux the sensible heat flux qs and latent heat flux ql accounted for 19 3 and 0 7 respectively most of the incoming shortwave radiation sin was reflected because of high albedo after new snow deposited on october 29 2014 the calculated results showed that the amount of snow underwent sublimation ms and melting m was only 0 005 mm and 3 5 mm respectively this proved that both sublimation and refreezing melting process exerted only a minor effect on the isotope content in snow during this period overall the sublimation and or evaporation and refreezing melting process were not controlling factors during the observation period furthermore isotopic exchange between the snow and atmospheric water vapor was considered to be minor because the observed slope decreased rather than increased diffusion and dispersion would not lead to significant enrichment of heavy isotopes therefore wind may be the controlling factor to observe the effect of wind on the isotopic modification of snow the wind speed and wind direction during the observation period were analyzed fig 7 the wind speed ranged between 1 4 m s and 13 7 m s with an average value of 5 7 m s the chart of the wind roses showed that most of the wind flowed from the northeast and east with a frequency of 66 6 the next prevailing wind direction was from southeast with a frequency of 11 1 this indicated that the up valley wind dominated the study area during the sampling period in general the δ 18o and δd values in the snow were found to decrease with an increase in altitude he et al 2006 yao et al 2013 the prevailing up valley wind could move the snow from low altitudes with relatively enriched δ 18o and δd to high altitudes resulting in the enrichment of heavy isotopes in snow located at high altitudes in addition the insignificant decreasing trend for δ 18o and δd with altitude in snow sampled on 30 october 2014 can also be attributed to wind drift the wind speed ranging between 0 3 and 4 8 m s was low between 0 00 and 12 00 and was 2 m s in most of the remaining time on october 29 when the snow was deposited new snow with a low density can be moved by wind which changed the spatial redistribution of 18o and d in snow 5 3 controlling processes on isotopic modification during the ablation period during the ablation period a decreasing trend of the slope and the gradual enrichment of 18o and d in the leaving snow were observed which were considered to be the result of the melting process isotopic homogenization occurred at the depth of 150 250 cm above the glacier surface in may snowpack and almost the whole vertical profile in june snowpack indicating the effects of melting on the isotopic composition of snow this was because the daily temperature was 0 c during the latter half of april resulting in the melting of snow fig 2a as the temperature increased gradually in may and june the melting rate increased and large amounts of meltwater were generated the meltwater generated at the snow surface percolated from the surface to snow layers below taylor et al 2001 during this process isotopic exchange occurred between liquid water and ice causing isotopic redistribution of both oxygen and hydrogen isotopes nakawo et al 1993 lee et al 2009 2010a taylor et al 2001 2002 and feng et al 2002 have presented a physically based one dimensional model to describe stable isotopic exchanges between snow and liquid water their studies have indicated that liquid water may become relatively depleted in 18o relative to ice because the δ 18o value is 3 1 lower than that of the ice at equilibrium consequently heavy isotopes tend to exit in the leaving snow resulting in the enrichment of 18o and d in snow nakawo et al 1993 taylor et al 2001 feng et al 2002 lee et al 2010a snow properties such as grain size distribution porosity permeability and wetness as well as the rate of melting would determine the effectiveness of isotopic exchange and the fraction of ice in the ice water isotopic exchange system and would then determine the range of the isotope contents in snow and meltwater feng et al 2002 hence the extent of enrichment of 18o and d differed between snowpacks isotopic exchange has been reported to be controlled by ice liquid water equilibrium fractionation factors of 3 1 and 19 5 for oxygen and hydrogen respectively thus suggesting a slope of 8 close to 19 5 3 1 6 3 for the δ18o and δd values of snowmelt o neil 1968 lee et al 2009 2010a this process not only led to a decrease in the δd δ 18o slope from snow to snowmelt but also resulted in a decrease in the slope in snow profiles with an increasing rate of melting which was observed in this study similar evolution of the δd δ 18o slope has been observed by several studies a slope change of 0 8 from 10 4 to 8 7 from june to july was observed in snowpit at zhadang glacier in the central tibetan plateau zhou et al 2014 whereas a slope change of 1 7 from 10 4 to 8 7 from june to july was observed at the qiyi glacier located at the northeast edge of the tibetan plateau zhou et al 2008a lee et al 2010a showed a decreasing trend in the slope the descending order was as follows new snow snow profiles snow melt gurney and lawrence 2004 observed that the slope of δd δ 18o for a snowpit decreased from april to august from 7 5 to 6 2 which was mainly the result of evaporation of liquid water within the snowpit a best fit line for meltwater with a slope of 4 4 was also suggested however in the meltwater the δd δ 18o slope does not always decrease from 8 to the theoretical value of 6 3 gurney and lawrence 2004 notably the bulk effect of both snowpit melting and refreezing on the d excess of a snow layer was not uniform the situation was complicated by the initial d excess values and the heterogeneity of snowpits which was consistent with the report that the d excess changes associated with refreezing of a melted snow layer may decrease or increase depending on the difference between the isotopic compositions of the liquid and solid phases prior to refreezing zhou et al 2008a 2014 rainfall is another possible factor influencing the vertical isotope profiles as well as the isotopic composition of snow meltwater when air temperature is higher than 2 c in glacial region precipitation usually falls as rain accelerating the melting of glacier and snow because of the energy supplied by rainfall van et al 2016 lee et al 2010b confirmed the effect of rainfall on the isotopic composition of a snowpack according to artificial rain on snow experiments rainfall does occur in june when temperature is relatively high in mt yulong region xin et al 2013 the influence of rainfall on isotope content of snowpack in mt yulong region was examined considering sp3 sampled on june 1 and sp4 sampled on june 10 for example overall the rainfall exerted minor effect on the isotopic evolution of snowpack in this study because firstly both precipitation and snow melting occurred during the observation days june 1 to june 10 about 55 cm depth of snow 26 9 cm snow water equivalent had melted whereas only 5 2 cm of rain fell near the sampling site the amount of rain was little relative to melt water indicating that the melting process should be the main process controlling the isotopic evolution of snowpack secondly the average density of sp3 was relatively high 0 49 g cm3 the firn with high density would prevent rainfall from infiltrating into the snow layers moreover the rainfall was usually concentrated with short duration most of rainfall flows directly over the surface of snow or be discharged into the glacier according to englacial drainage conduits fountain and walder 1998 as a result only a little rainfall can percolate through the upper snow layers thirdly the vertical isotopic evolution of snowpack did not support the influence of rainfall if rainfall can percolate down the snow layers isotopic exchange between liquid and solid water would occur resulting in heavy isotope enrichment in the leaving snow lee et al 2010b nevertheless the upper 10 cm of sp4 was relatively depleted in heavy isotopes δ18o 8 8 relative to the same depth of sp3 δ18o 6 7 this confirmed that the effect of rainfall on vertical isotope profiles was minor in this study 6 conclusion new snow was relatively depleted in heavy isotopes during the post monsoon period but enriched in heavy isotopes during the pre monsoon period the temporally changing trend of the isotopic composition of surface snow was similar to that of new snow during the non monsoon period surface snow was enriched in 18o and d relative to new snow sampled during the same period due to post depositional processes distinct variations were noted from april to june for the snowpack depth and the vertical isotopic composition of snowpacks isotopic homogenization occurred under the influence of snow melting the slope of the δ 18o δd line was 8 during the post monsoon period and was 8 during the westerly and pre monsoon periods and this variation can be attributed to changes in temperature post depositional processes may also alter the slope of the δ 18o δd line in snow the isotopic composition of new snow was closely related to water vapor sources whereas the vertical isotopic variation of snowpack sampled at the end of accumulation period reflected winter precipitation moreover the seasonal isotopic signals in snow layers were obscured by post depositional processes particularly in the ablation period isotopic analysis and the energy balance model demonstrated that partial melting refreezing occurred at the beginning of the accumulation period but this process exerted a minor influence on the isotopic composition of snow sublimation or evaporation can almost be neglected wind drift was the most crucial factor during the accumulation period altering the isotopic composition of snow in addition the melting process was the most crucial post depositional process leading to the isotopic modification of snow during the ablation period the decreasing trend of slope and the gradual enrichment of 18o and d in the leaving snow mainly resulted from isotopic exchange between liquid water and snow during the melting process this study is expected to benefit our understanding of post depositional processes of snow on temperate glaciers and provide a reference for investigating the depositional and post depositional processes of snow using stable isotopes credit authorship contribution statement tao pu project administration writing original draft yanlong kong writing review editing shijin wang

mohorji et al 2017 and şen 2017b have separated the data into 3 4 5 6 11 and 13 parts and identified trends in a comparative manner a modified version of ita is proposed by tabari et al 2017 with the quantile perturbation method in their approach the measurements are divided into decades and comparison with each other güçlü 2018b c proposed multiple ita as improvements of şen s procedure and partial mk trend approach and quantified the trends using frequency analysis the change point approach for a single trend identification is proposed by pettitt 1979 and şen 2019 recently provided the general partial trend analysis by the change point in a given time series the main goal of this paper is to represent a new version of trend analysis methodology by comparing with classical mk test and simple şen ita method the introduction of the proposed trend methodology is based on its comparisons with well known methods and the application is achieved by consideration of 50 year rainfall time series from different locations in turkey finally the change point determination on the new graph is obtained objectively via pettit test for sub categories 2 methodology homogeneous time series are extremely important for trend analysis studies of hydro meteorological variables because the trends in them result from the changes in climate and air conrad and pollak 1950 non climatic changes may disrupt the homogeneity of the time series and therefore homogeneity test is required before trend analysis in this study run homogeneity test for rainfall data is applied to determine the homogeneity of the data at 5 significance level through the following expression swed and eisenhart 1943 1 z r r 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 2 n 1 n 2 2 n 1 n 2 n n 2 n 1 where zr is the run homogeneity test result n is the number of data r is the run number n1 n2 is number of lower higher values than the median if the calculated zr value corresponds to 5 significance level or below then the data is non homogeneous herein only homogeneous data are used to identify trend conditions the non parametric mk trend test is widely used to assess the significance of monotonic trends in hydro meteorological time series in order to write increasing or decreasing expressions the mann kendall zmk value is taken into consideration the decreasing increasing expression is used for the time series with negative positive zmk value the standard zmk value for mk test is given as 2 z mk s 1 v s f o r s 0 0 f o r s 0 s 1 v s f o r s 0 3 v s n n 1 2 n 5 18 4 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k 5 s g n x j x k 1 i f x

neutral 0 signs sgn with eq 5 where xj and xk are time series values at time instances j and k respectively from a given time series x1 x2 xk xj xn with n observations finally the trend is considered significant if zmk is more than the significance levels such as α 20 zmk zα 2 1 282 low confidence level α 10 zmk zα 2 1 645 moderate confidence level or α 5 zmk zα 2 1 96 high confidence level şen s ita method provides visions in trend analysis as it depicts monotonically or non monotonically increasing or decreasing trends and also the data scatter shows easily even minor trends by consideration of five different trend conditions namely monotonic and non monotonic increasing monotonic and non monotonic decreasing and no trend types the basic procedure of the ita has already been explained by şen 2012 in detail by partitioning a given data into two equal parts all possible five trend possibilities are shown illustratively in fig 1 the ita test does not indicate the dimension number of the data and sub categories the new illustration type of şen s method not only shows mentioned trends but also depicts the dimension number of the data and objective sub categories the calculation of this method s steps includes the first two stages of şen ita as follows 1 any given data including n data a1 a2 an is separated into two equal series b1 n 2 and b2 n 2 as 6 b 1 n 2 a 1 a 2 a n 2 and 7 b 2 n 2 a n 2 1 a n 2 2 a n 2 each equal part is ordered in ascending manner hence there are two ordered series s1 and s2 with the same number of elements 8 s 1 min b 1 n 2 b i max b 1 n 2 1 i n 2 and 9 s 2 min b 2 n 2 b j max b 2 n 2 1 j n 2 3 the data of s1 are on vertical axis are plotted versus the values of 1 2 3 n 2 1 n 2 series on horizontal axis 4 the data of s2 are on vertical axis versus the values of 1 2 3 n 2 1 n 2 series on horizontal axis 5 the different values of s1 and s2 s2 s1 are pointed on vertical axis against the values of 1 2 3 n 2 1 n 2 series on horizontal axis 6 if all the different values fall on the horizontal axis or with random deviations from the horizontal axis insignificantly then there is no significant trend in the time series 7 otherwise there are increasing or decreasing trend component if the different values are above below of the horizontal line y 0 then there is an increasing decreasing trend significantly hypothetical visualizations using the same random data are presented for the new illustration type of ita in fig 2 a and the classical one in fig 2b 8 the last step is to define objectively sub categories named as high and low values by using pettit test calculating change point on the difference data fig 2 it can be seen that in fig 2 horizontal axis y 0 line runs like the classical 1 1 straight line below above the lines is decreasing increasing trend area and scatter points on or around the lines reflect no trend condition especially two positive aspects of the proposed approach are revealed without any negative aspect by comparison with the classical approaches 1 the new illustration type of şen s ita method shows the dimension number of the data clearly in fig 2a low values have more measurement points than high values but it is difficult to determine how many of sub series data are on the ita as it can be seen in fig 2b the number of low high values are few many especially this problem can occur when there are many available data 2 pettitt change point test can be applied to difference series on the suggested methodology and the change point is found where its left right side is called as low high values objectively in fig 2a green and red parallel lines reflect increasing and decreasing trends according to mean values of the sub categories differences red and green change point parallel lines can be moved on the classical graph fig 2b where the percentage of each sub group is calculated with 100 left side differences mean left side first half mean and 100 right side differences mean right side first half mean in a given time series pettitt 1979 implementation leads to a single change point the test statistical t may follow few probability distribution functions pdfs with the same position parameter no change against the alternative one where a change point exists the pettitt test statistics is defined as 10 k t m a x u t t where 11 u t t i 1 t j t 1 t s g n x i x j and kt is the change point location in case of significance level probability p which is approximately less than or equal to 5 12 p 2 e x p 6 k t 2 t 3 t 2 3 application there are three prevailing climate types in turkey due to its temperate and subtropical zones the mediterranean climate prevails in the southern and eastern parts of the country with significant rainfall amounts during wet winter and dry hot summer periods in the north the black sea region has rainy seasons especially in winter due to the movement of moist air mass from the north and northwest directions marmara sea between aegean and black seas has a transitional mediterranean climate with warm to hot summer and cool to cold winter seasons the inner regions of turkey and eastern anatolia are under the effects of dry hot summer seasons where winter seasons are snowy cold continental climate in summary mediterranean black sea and continental climate types are affective in turkey turkish meteorological service mgm in turkish recorded the highest daily total rainfall data in mm for each year from 1966 to 2015 50 year at çanakkale kuşadası silifke edirne siirt kocaeli ordu and zonguldak stations table 1 and fig 3 which are located in different climate regions of turkey homogeneity test is performed for the rainfall time series at all stations with 95 confidence level 5 significance level and the data are found as homogeneous the mk trend test is implemented to the rainfall data and the results are represented in table 2 which indicates that the data records at çanakkle kuşadası and edirne stations along the west region of turkey have monotonically increasing trend but others have no significant trend additionally the data from çanakkale and kuşadası stations on the aegean cost line have 5 significance level high confidence level but the trend in edirne records appears at 20 significance level low confidence level although no significant trend on the remaining stations kocaeli and zonguldak records have decreasing trend because of the negative zmk values while ordu siirt and silifke have positive zmk values the most extreme rainfall case is recorded for each year and there are 50 such values for 24 hour duration daily total the first half with 25 year duration runs from 1966 to1990 whereas the second half covers 1991 2015 periods in each case the data groups are ordered in ascending manner these two steps are necessary in the şen ita methodology and new illustration type of the ita the rainfall time series trends according to each procedure are represented in figs 4 11 for çanakkale kuşadası silifke edirne siirt kocaeli ordu and zonguldak stations respectively their comparisons present monotonically or non monotonically different trends indicating the importance of the proposed graphical approach çanakkale station records have increasing monotonic trends fig 4b according to the ita and mk tests two different increasing trend conditions are obtained according the pettit test on difference series because the new type of ita reveals 40 increasing trend on high values category while low values category has 21 increasing trend fig 4a even though all trend tests reveal the same result for kuşadası station records table 2 fig 5 the new type of ita shows increasing trend with 32 and 23 on high and low category respectively fig 5a the trend on silifke station appears in the form of two increasing types similar to çanakkale and kuşadası data because high values indicate significant increasing trend with 14 and low values trend has 2 5 increasing insignificantly fig 6 edirne and siirt station s time series have obvious monotonic increasing trends with respective 13 and 14 and without any change point according to the pettit test on the proposed ita fig 7a and 8a in addition the same decision is valid visually on şen s ita methodology fig 7b and 8b on the other hand no need to categorize the data because 5 significant change point does not exist thus it can be clearly said that sometimes sub categorization is unnecessary finally the same trend conditions exist at kocaeli ordu and zonguldak stations because low high sub categories have increasing decreasing trend but the numerical results are calculated differently high values at kocaeli station indicate significant decreasing trend with 23 but low values trend is has 4 increasing which is insignificant fig 9a on the other hand both the low and high sub categories for ordu and zonguldak stations have significant increasing trends 9 and 12 and decreasing ones 14 and 11 respectively see figs 10a and 11a in addition according to the change points by pettitt test in the new type of ita numbers of low and high values appear differently from each other the new ita shows number and range of data but the classical one shows the range only this positive aspect of the proposed method appears especially in figs 9 and 10 by comparing with the classical ita after all additional information on the trends in a time series is revealed by the new illustration graph of ita 4 discussion and conclusion the classical mk trend test approach detects only monotonically increasing decreasing and no trend conditions mann 1945 kendall 1975 innovative trend analysis ita method determines and visualizes the five different trend types not only monotonically but also non monotonically şen 2012 in order to get more information about the trends the new illustration graph is proposed as useful and beneficial contributions to the şen ita method the new ita visualization shows clearly the number of the data unlike the ita applications tabari et al 2017 mohorji et al 2017 güçlü 2018a b şişman 2019 in addition the change point on difference series is identified by universal pettitt test and then two sub categories are defined as high and low values objectively some researchers dabanlı et al 2016 yilmaz and tosunoglu 2019 güçlü et al 2019 represented their studies with three or more sub categories using suitable methodologies for their own works hence the new approach has digressions from the previous ita methodology in depicting not only the turning point possibility in the differences time series but also high and low categorization in addition to the number of data points in each class the application of the suggested methodology is presented for a set of meteorology station rainfall records for 50 year duration from different locations of turkey the results indicate significance of novel graphical type through the comparisons although monotonic increasing trend appears by the ita and mk trend tests on çanakkale and kuşadası stations data the new approach reveals two different increasing trends with 40 and 32 on high values and 21 and 23 on low values respectively the data records at silifke station have no trend by mk test but the presented method shows 14 significant trend on high values like çanakkale and kuşadası records although the classical ita and novel graphs have illustrated uniform increasing trend for edirne 13 and siirt 14 stations records mk test cannot detect the increasing trends at moderate or high confidence level in addition the suggested graph exposes that sub categorization is occasionally unnecessary high values of kocaeli ordu and zonguldak stations data have decreasing trend with 23 14 and 11 but their low values have increasing trends at 4 9 and 12 respectively the mk test does not detect any significant trend at the same station as a result the proposed illustration approach shows the climatic distinctions that are not possible by mk trend test hence the suggested method helps to identify the climate regions distinctively according to their types such as mediterranean black sea and continental which are dominant in turkey

the change point location in case of significance level probability p which is approximately less than or equal to 5 12 p 2 e x p 6 k t 2 t 3 t 2 3 application there are three prevailing climate types in turkey due to its temperate and subtropical zones the mediterranean climate prevails in the southern and eastern parts of the country with significant rainfall amounts during wet winter and dry hot summer periods in the north the black sea region has rainy seasons especially in winter due to the movement of moist air mass from the north and northwest directions marmara sea between aegean and black seas has a transitional mediterranean climate with warm to hot summer and cool to cold winter seasons the inner regions of turkey and eastern anatolia are under the effects of dry hot summer seasons where winter seasons are snowy cold continental climate in summary mediterranean black sea and continental climate types are affective in turkey turkish meteorological service mgm in turkish recorded the highest daily total rainfall data in mm for each year from 1966 to 2015 50 year at çanakkale kuşadası silifke edirne siirt kocaeli ordu and zonguldak stations table 1 and fig 3 which are located in different climate regions of turkey homogeneity test is performed for the rainfall time series at all stations with 95 confidence level 5 significance level and the data are found as homogeneous the mk trend test is implemented to the rainfall data and the results are represented in table 2 which indicates that the data records at çanakkle kuşadası and edirne stations along the west region of turkey have monotonically increasing trend but others have no significant trend additionally the data from çanakkale and kuşadası stations on the aegean cost line have 5 significance level high confidence level but the trend in edirne records appears at 20 significance level low confidence level although no significant trend on the remaining stations kocaeli and zonguldak records have decreasing trend because of the negative zmk values while ordu siirt and silifke have positive zmk values the most extreme rainfall case is recorded for each year and there are 50 such values for 24 hour duration daily total the first half with 25 year duration runs from 1966 to1990 whereas the second half covers 1991 2015 periods in each case the data groups are ordered in ascending manner these two steps are necessary in the şen ita methodology and new illustration type of the ita the rainfall time series trends according to each procedure are represented in figs 4 11 for çanakkale kuşadası silifke edirne siirt kocaeli ordu and zonguldak stations respectively their comparisons present monotonically or non monotonically different trends indicating the importance of the proposed graphical approach çanakkale station records have increasing monotonic trends fig 4b according to the ita and mk tests two different increasing trend conditions are obtained according the pettit test on difference series because the new type of ita reveals 40 increasing trend on high values category while low values category has 21 increasing trend fig 4a even though all trend tests reveal the same result for kuşadası station records table 2 fig 5 the new type of ita shows increasing trend with 32 and 23 on high and low category respectively fig 5a the trend on silifke station appears in the form of two increasing types similar to çanakkale and kuşadası data because high values indicate significant increasing trend with 14 and low values trend has 2 5 increasing insignificantly fig 6 edirne and siirt station s time series have obvious monotonic increasing trends with respective 13 and 14 and without any change point according to the pettit test on the proposed ita fig 7a and 8a in addition the same decision is valid visually on şen s ita methodology fig 7b and 8b on the other hand no need to categorize the data because 5 significant change point does not exist thus it can be clearly said that sometimes sub categorization is unnecessary finally the same trend conditions exist at kocaeli ordu and zonguldak stations because low high sub categories have increasing decreasing trend but the numerical results are calculated differently high values at kocaeli station indicate significant decreasing trend with 23 but low values trend is has 4 increasing which is insignificant fig 9a on the other hand both the low and high sub categories for ordu and zonguldak stations have significant increasing trends 9 and 12 and decreasing ones 14 and 11 respectively see figs 10a and 11a in addition according to the change points by pettitt test in the new type of ita numbers of low and high values appear differently from each other the new ita shows number and range of data but the classical one shows the range only this positive aspect of the proposed method appears especially in figs 9 and 10 by comparing with the classical ita after all additional information on the trends in a time series is revealed by the new illustration graph of ita 4 discussion and conclusion the classical mk trend test approach detects only monotonically increasing decreasing and no trend conditions mann 1945 kendall 1975 innovative trend analysis ita method determines and visualizes the five different trend types not only monotonically but also non monotonically şen 2012 in order to get more information about the trends the new illustration graph is proposed as useful and beneficial contributions to the şen ita method the new ita visualization shows clearly the number of the data unlike the ita applications tabari et al 2017 mohorji et al 2017 güçlü 2018a b şişman 2019 in addition the change point on difference series is identified by universal pettitt test and then two sub categories are defined as high and low values objectively some researchers dabanlı et al 2016 yilmaz and tosunoglu 2019 güçlü et al 2019 represented their studies with three or more sub categories using suitable methodologies for their own works hence the new approach has digressions from the previous ita methodology in depicting not only the turning point possibility in the differences time series but also high and low categorization in addition to the number of data points in each class the application of the suggested methodology is presented for a set of meteorology station rainfall records for 50 year duration from different locations of turkey the results indicate significance of novel graphical type through the comparisons although monotonic increasing trend appears by the ita and mk trend tests on çanakkale and kuşadası stations data the new approach reveals two different increasing trends with 40 and 32 on high values and 21 and 23 on low values respectively the data records at silifke station have no trend by mk test but the presented method shows 14 significant trend on high values like çanakkale and kuşadası records although the classical ita and novel graphs have illustrated uniform increasing trend for edirne 13 and siirt 14 stations records mk test cannot detect the increasing trends at moderate or high confidence level in addition the suggested graph exposes that sub categorization is occasionally unnecessary high values of kocaeli ordu and zonguldak stations data have decreasing trend with 23 14 and 11 but their low values have increasing trends at 4 9 and 12 respectively the mk test does not detect any significant trend at the same station as a result the proposed illustration approach shows the climatic distinctions that are not possible by mk trend test hence the suggested method helps to identify the climate regions distinctively according to their types such as mediterranean black sea and continental which are dominant in turkey

5627,to improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation qpe numerous models have been developed for merging satellite and gauge precipitation however most established merging methods consider the spatial or temporal correlation between satellite data and rain gauge data separately and the produced merged precipitation is still limited by low spatial resolution and regional inaccuracy in this study a deep fusion model is proposed to merge the trmm 3b42 v7 satellite data rain gauge data and thermal infrared images by exploiting their spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously specifically the convolutional neural network cnn is combined with a long short term memory network lstm where the spatial characteristics of satellite rain gauge and thermal infrared data are extracted by cnn while their time dependence is captured by lstm experiment results on 796 rain gauges in china show that the proposed cnn lstm model outperforms the comparative models cnn lstm multi layer perception it can improve the accuracy of the original trmm data in china reducing the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae by 17 0 and 14 7 respectively and increasing the correlation coefficient to 0 72 even for different precipitation intensities and gauge sparse regions finally a dataset of merged daily precipitation from 2001 to 2005 with a higher resolution of 0 05 and higher accuracy over china is produced this study provides a useful tool and a valuable dataset for qpe in china which would benefit water research and water resource management keywords deep learning satellite gauge merged precipitation quantitative precipitation estimation spatiotemporal fusion model 1 introduction as a crucial component of water cycle precipitation plays important roles in supporting water and energy exchange and connecting biosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and atmosphere gat and airey 2006 the spatial distribution of precipitation is extremely complex and has profound impacts on meteorology and hydrology and their associated processes chen and chung 2015 niu et al 2017 for instance 70 80 of the uncertainty of terrestrial hydrological processes is attributed to the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation syed et al 2004 gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 moreover floods caused by heavy rainfall events and the resulting landslides have become one of the most serious natural disasters in the world jonkman 2005 xu et al 2018 therefore the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation qpe is of great importance for hydrology meteorology climatology agriculture ecology and natural disaster prevention etc however due to the strong multi scale spatiotemporal variability accurate estimation of precipitation still remains challenges precipitation is predominantly measured estimated by rain gauge and satellite remote sensing rain gauge is a traditional yet most reliable way to directly measure precipitation at the earth s surface lanza and stagi 2008 diverse datasets of precipitation products based on in situ observations have been developed on both regional and global scales for example cru ts3 1 monthly grid precipitation dataset global precipitation climatology center datasets and the daily precipitation over east asia xie et al 2007 to mention a few however rain gauge suffers several drawbacks such as poor spatial representation limited space coverage and uneven spatial distribution kidd et al 2017 rana et al 2015 as for china the eastern part has much higher density of rain gauges than that of western china for instance the nearest distance of neighboring gauges is about 10 km in eastern china versus 500 km on the tibetan plateau shen et al 2018 thus the accuracy of gauge based interpolated qpe is highly affected by gauge density in contrast remote sensing infrared ir sensors passive microwave pmw radiometers and precipitation radars based precipitation products show advantages on capturing the spatial pattern and temporal variation of precipitation for vast areas of the globe up to present various satellite based precipitation products have been widely applied such as the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm huffman et al 2007 the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph products joyce et al 2004 and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann ashouri et al 2015 however large systematic bias and random errors are associated with satellite precipitation products in comparison with the in situ rain gauge data shen et al 2010 to improve the accuracy of the qpe the satellite products and rain gauge data can be combined taking the best of each the accuracy of gauge data and the spatial coverage of satellite data in recent years huge efforts have been made on merging satellite and rain gauge data and a number of merged precipitation products with higher accuracy have become available shi et al 2017 for instance the monthly precipitation estimations on 2 5 grid and the daily precipitation dataset on 1 grid produced by the global precipitation climatology project gpcp liu et al 2016 the cmorph fusion precipitation products developed by the us climate prediction center noaa cpc hussain et al 2018 the gauge satellite merged analysis of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 huffman et al 2007 and the global pmw merged precipitation estimate of the cooperative institute for climate studies high resolution optimally interpolated microwave precipitation from satellites joseph et al 2009 particularly trmm version 7 trmm v7 has been verified outperforming the other aforementioned remote sensing precipitation products liu et al 2016 however the adjusted trmm products are still limited by its regional inaccuracy and low spatial resolution a variety of gauge satellite fusion approaches have been proposed which can broadly fall into two categories global correction and local correction the global correction methods include mean bias correction grimes et al 1999 nonparametric kernel smoothing li and shao 2010 probability density function xie and xiong 2011 and linearized weighting procedures woldemeskel et al 2013 the local correction methods refer to co kriging chappell et al 2013 krajewski 1987 regression kriging dinku et al 2014 geographically weighted regression chao et al 2018 bayesian combination nerini et al 2015 todini 2001 and optimal interpolation shen et al 2014 wu et al 2018 xie and xiong 2011 the global methods play a smoothing effect on the overall space without considering the spatial difference of precipitation although the local methods take into account the spatial autocorrelation of precipitation they perform better in regions with denser rain gauges but overestimate in areas with sparse stations and high uncertainty is often associated with the fusion results nerini et al 2015 however most existing satellite gauge fusion methods both the global correction and the local correction methods are traditional mathematical regression models relying on strong assumptions which may be invalid in reality more importantly the established models generally explore the spatial and or temporal correlation patterns between rain gauges and satellite precipitation products separately instead of simultaneously compared with traditional interpolation or regression methods deep learning methods which have stronger learning and generalization abilities have advantages in modeling more complex patterns in data and processing massive amounts of data lecun et al 2015 shao et al 2017b shao et al 2019b aswin et al 2018 chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 oshri et al 2018 shao et al 2015 in recent years deep learning has developed rapidly in the fields of image recognition speech recognition natural language processing as well as precipitation forecasting ha et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 xie et al 2018 shao et al 2017a shao et al 2019a yang et al 2019 for instance convolutional long short term memory network lstm was introduced for radar precipitation forecasting shi et al 2015 qiu et al 2017 applied multi task convolutional neural networks to learn the correlation between time series and sites and then use it for precipitation forecasting ashouri et al 2015 used the artificial neural network to invert original satellite imagery thermal infrared microwave sensor image such as persiann which is a satellite precipitation estimation system based on an artificial neural network model ashouri et al 2015 miao et al 2019 tao et al 2016 in addition the deep neural network dnn is applied to estimate rain and snow rates in high latitudes tang et al 2018 boushaki et al 2009 to the best of our knowledge deep learning has not been explored in the fusion of rain gauge and satellite precipitation in this study we aim to propose a spatiotemporal deep fusion model to yield satellite gauge merged precipitation with higher resolution and higher accuracy in china the objectives of this study include 1 propose a deep fusion model for satellite gauge by combing the convolutional neural network cnn with a long short term memory network lstm 2 taking the trmm and rain gauge data in china as example to verify the efficiency of the proposed cnn lstm model via comparing with other comparative methods 3 produce a satellite gauge merged precipitation dataset with higher resolution and accuracy for china 2 study area and data acquisition 2 1 study area the study area is china located in east asian between 73 135 e and 10 53 n fig 1 china has complex terrain with the altitude ranging from negative eastern plains to higher than 8000 m tibetan plateau water vapor from two main sources pacific ocean and indian ocean are blocked by the tibetan plateau when it climbs from south and east to north and west effected by east asian monsoon and southwest monsoon and topography annual precipitation distribution in china exhibits high variation in space ranging from 100 mm to 2000 m lu et al 2019 and time 60 70 concentrates in flood season liu et al 2016 2 2 data acquisition satellite precipitation data in situ rain gauge data digital elevation model dem and gridded satellite gridsat b1 data are used in this study the basic information of these data sets has been summarized in table 1 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm is the first meteorological satellite dedicated to the observation of tropical and subtropical precipitation launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploratory agency jaxa in november 1997 huffman et al 2007 liu et al 2012 the trmm 3b42 v7 product a level 3 data is used in this study the in situ rain gauge network observation data are from the national surface weather data day value dataset v3 0 provided by china meteorological data service center cmdc it covers sub daily 8 00 20 00 20 00 8 00 the next day precipitation on 816 national meteorological stations in the mainland of china since 1951 to present the distribution of the rain gauges is not uniform most of which are concentrated in the central and eastern china while sparse gauges are located in high altitude areas in western china where the precipitation information is very deficient to keep consistent with the time range and space coverage of trmm and to avoid the gauges with missing data the daily precipitation data on 796 rain gauges as shown in fig 1 between 2001 and 2005 were selected for further study gridded satellite gridsat b1 data derived from merging isccp b1 ir data provides a high quality climate data record cdr of global infrared measurements from geostationary satellites knapp et al 2011 gridsat b1 supplies near global data for three channels the cdr quality infrared window irwin channel near 11 μm the visible channel near 0 6 μm and the infrared water vapor irwvp channel near 6 7 μm the dataset is projected onto a global 0 07 latitude equal angle grid with date coverage spanning from 1st january 1980 to present covering the globe of 70 s 70 n and 180 w 180 e the gridsat b1 irwin brightness temperature data 3 hourly time scale are gridded to a 0 07 spatial resolution the irwin cdr nadir most infrared window observation data are used in this paper besides the digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 90 m is derived from the usgs nasa srtm data 3 methodology the framework of the proposed multi source spatio temporal data fusion model based on deep learning is illustrated in fig 2 the whole process can be divided into three parts 1 data pre processing which includes time alignment downscaling the trmm data to 0 05 and unifying time scale to daily and training data extraction 2 establishing the spatio temporal deep neural network model by combining cnn and lstm 3 precipitation fusion and evaluation during which precipitation is merged and corrected for the study area based on the proposed model and the model performance is quantified via certain evaluation metrics 3 1 data preprocessing firstly the missing data and outliers in the satellite dataset trmm 3b42 v7 and the rain gauge observation dataset are processed for different types of missing values according to their temporal and spatial similarity respectively the time adjacent or spatial proximity value is used for replacement since the satellite data uses utc time and the rain gauges data uses beijing time all data sets need to be time matched then the original trmm s 3hr rainfall rate data are converted to daily cumulative rainfall to obtain a finer spatial distribution of precipitation and to generate more data in a smaller area for convolution operations the trmm data are downscaled to 0 05 by using the nearest neighbor interpolation method which keeps the pixel values and avoids introducing new errors the dem data are resampled to 0 05 by pixel averaging gridsat b1 selects the cdr quality infrared window irwin channel near 11 μm data considering dem and gridsat b1 data have different dimensions which may exert impacts on neural network training they are normalized considering the spatial representation of precipitation for each ground gauge a 7 7 sub grids about 38 5 km 38 5 km centered on it is extracted afterwards the satellite data at the identified corresponding grids on each time step is extracted finally a training dataset corresponding to the satellite grid and the measured precipitation on time and space is established the detailed extraction method is shown in fig 3 3 2 basic deep neural network models the convolutional neural networks cnn can automatically extract important feature information of the image through the view of the convolution kernel and the combined characteristics of the neurons therefore in the field of image recognition the convolutional neural network can obtain better results cnn uses a set of elements distributed at different locations of the image but with the same weight vector to acquire the features of the image and form a feature map at each location cells from different feature maps get their own different types of features therefore it can extract the spatial features of two dimensional data in the estimation of the precipitation field the precipitation information of each point is related to the information around it and this spatial feature information can be obtained through cnn it can automatically learn the spatial dependence of the target grid and the surrounding area by different perceptual domains through a multi layer convolutional neural network the multi layer perception mlp lecun et al 2015 also called artificial neural network mainly includes input layer hidden layer and output layer and the hidden layer can contain multiple layers the mlp layers are fully connected to each other meaning that a neuron in a layer is connected to all cells in the adjacent layers all the parameters are the connection weights and bias when the activation function of the multilayer perceptron is non linear the multilayer perceptron is equivalent to a powerful nonlinear regression model the recurrent neural network rnn is a general term for a series of neural networks that can process sequential data different from the fully connected neural network layer the rnn layer has a feedback connection that allows past information to affect the current output therefore the output of the current time of the rnn layer is the accumulation of its current input and the output of the previous moment through this structure rnn has the ability to remember past information as an improvement to rnn the long short term memory lstm networks are explicitly designed to avoid the long term dependency problem compared to traditional rnns lstm adds four structures cell state input gates forget gates and output gates the cell state is used to store the accumulation of past information the forget gate determines how much of the cell state at the previous moment is retained to the current time the input gate determines how much information of the network input is saved to the cell state at the current time and the output gate determines how much information the cell state outputs formally the formulations are given as follows 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 4 h t o t t a n h c t 5 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 6 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where f t i t o t represent the forget input and output gate c t is the memory cell h is a hidden vector w and b are weight matrix and bias term a b represents connecting two vectors into a longer vector and r e p r e s e n t s the element wise multiplication for precipitation estimation the precipitation information at each time point is related to the precipitation information of its past time the time dependence of precipitation information at different time points can be obtained through lstm 3 3 deep neural network fusion model cnn lstm to model the spatial and temporal correlations between rain gauges and satellite estimations simultaneously cnn is used to learn the spatial characteristics and lstm is applied to capture the time dependence finally a joint spatio temporal deep neural network model by combining cnn and lstm is proposed to merge precipitation data fig 4 illustrates the framework of the proposed model the deep neural network fusion model includes two parts namely the cnn spatial feature extraction module and the lstm module the cnn spatial feature extraction module is configured to extract feature vectors related to precipitation of the center point of the grid from the satellite data in the precipitation fusion precipitation at each spatial location does not exist in isolation but are associated with the surrounding space the use of cnn can extract precipitation information in the area around the target providing a reference for the correction of the current target point it mainly consists of a convolutional layer and a pooled layer with different convolution kernels the activation function uses relu trmm dem and gridsat b1 data are spliced through separate convolutional networks to generate the output of this module the lstm module is used to obtain the time dependence of precipitation for a certain time step precipitation information at the past moment will affect the precipitation at the current moment the past useful information can be retained to the current time by the cell state and gating unit of the lstm the detailed architecture and hyperparameters of the deep neural network fusion model are shown in fig 5 which represents the fusion process of precipitation from the input to the output at a time step t the rounded rectangles represent data input output and intermediate results where the content is the data type and shape the rectangles represent different neural network layers and hyperparameters convolution2d is a 2 dimensional convolution layer followed by the size and number of convolution kernels dropout is a regularization method to prevent overfitting maxpooling is the maximum pooling layer flatten folds tensors into 1 dimensional vectors concatenate layer combines multiple vectors into one according to the specified axis bidirectional lstm is a bidirectional lstm layer dense is a fully connected layer and relu and elu are activation functions the coupling process of cnn and lstum is as follows 1 feature vectors of the trmm dem and gridsat b1 grid data are extracted via separate independent convolutional networks and then combined as the precipitation feature vector at the current moment 2 the precipitation feature vector at each moment is input into the bidirectional lstm to extract the time dependence of the forward and backward directions 3 the fused precipitation at each moment is output through the fully connected network in the proposed cnn lstm model the hyperparameters of each network layer are the optimal choices based on the data size and multiple experiments the fusion algorithm is mainly divided into two steps 1 training model the original trmm data are down scaled for each ground rain gauge the corresponding trrmm satellite data grid is extracted the constructed cnn lstm deep model is used for training to minimize the training loss 2 precipitation merging the trained model is used to correct each grid point of the satellite raster data and finally produce the fusion precipitation field over the entire study area 3 4 evaluation metrics to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed deep fusion model for precipitation merging the dataset from 796 rain gauges was divided into training and test sets by using 10 fold cross validation the performance at each rain gauge is evaluated by using the mean value of the ten trained models for the whole study area the final evaluation is based on the average of all gauges root mean square error rmse relative bias rb mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient cc are selected as the evaluation criteria these indicators are defined by the following equations 7 10 respectively 7 r m s e i 1 n p pre i p obs i 2 n 8 r b i 1 n p pre i p obs i t 1 n p obs i 9 m a e i 1 n p pre i p obs i n 10 c c i 1 n p pre i p pre p obs i p obs i 1 n p pre i p pre 2 i 1 n p obs i p obs 2 where p pre i and p obs i denote the predicted and the observed precipitation respectively p pre and p obs are the mean of the predicted and observed precipitation respectively n is the number of all observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 precipitation fusion performance using different models precipitation data from 796 meteorological stations were randomly divided into ten parts by using ten fold cross validation nine of which are used for training and the remaining one is used for testing at each time in order to illustrate the priority of the proposed cnn lstm model cnn model lstm model and mlp multi layer perception model were selected for comparison the performances of different models on precipitation fusion are shown in table 2 the quantitative comparison between the data fusion results and the original trmm indicates that the improvement of the mlp model is minimal that might because the mlp only nonlinearly fits the satellite data and the gauge data but does not consider their temporal and spatial correlation when cnn is used the error is significantly lower than that of mlp indicating that spatial information has a significant improvement in precipitation fusion when lstm is used alone which means that only the time dependence of precipitation is considered the error is also significantly reduced therefore the time correlation of precipitation also significantly improves precipitation fusion the cnn lstm model fully considers the dependence of precipitation on both time and space outperforming the comparable models the rmse is 1 88 mm d lower than the original trmm data and the correlation coefficient is improved from 0 66 to 0 72 it can be concluded from the relative bias that the original trmm data overestimates the precipitation which is consistent with the results of other researchers qin et al 2014 the rb of the merged precipitation reduces to 8 8 which underestimates the precipitation spatial distributions of metrics for original trmm and cnn lstm fusion daily precipitation over mainland china are shown in fig 6 based on the observations of the ground stations the original trmm and cnn lstm fusion models precipitation were calculated for cc rmse and mae at each gauge and the gauge values were interpolated into others using linear interpolation to obtain the spatial distribution of the metrics as can be seen from fig 6 the correlation coefficient of the fusion model is significantly improved in most areas and the rmse and mae also have a significant decline especially in the southeast coastal areas however cc is a little lower in the northwest even below 0 2 several possible factors are 1 the climate and topography in north western china are complex while satellites cannot obtain the accurate precipitation characteristics 2 there are so few gauges in the region that it is impossible to accurately measure the error with real precipitation the distributions of rmse and mae are also related to the intensity of precipitation showing a lower northwest and a higher southeast 4 2 fusion model performance under different precipitation intensities the error between the estimated and observed precipitation may differ under different precipitation intensities quantitative evaluation of error distribution under different precipitation intensities can better evaluate the fusion precipitation products table 3 shows the errors of the original trmm and the fusion product under four different precipitation intensities it can be found that the rmse and mae of cnn lstm fusion precipitation are significantly lower than those of the original trmm the probability of detection pod is significantly improved under different rainfall intensities for instance when the precipitation intensities are 0 1 5 mm d 5 10 mm d 10 25 mm d the rmse are reduced by 1 955 mm d 3 875 mm d 4 879 mm d respectively and the pod increased by 14 15 and 10 respectively however the error of the fusion precipitation increases when the precipitation intensity is greater than 25 mm d the main reason may be that the cnn lstm fusion model does not estimate the precipitation peaks but it is still better than the original trmm data it can be concluded that the cnn lstm fusion model can correct and improve the original trmm data under different precipitation intensities 4 3 spatial distribution of the merged precipitation following the proposed cnn lstm model the dataset of daily precipitation from 2001 to 2005 with a resolution of 0 05 in china is produced during the final precipitation fusion in order to obtain as many precipitation patterns as possible the deep neural network will be trained using data from all rain gauges for illustration fig 7 shows the precipitation fields of the original trmm downscaling trmm cnn lstm model production and the gauges interpolation on 13 september 2002 due to the impact of tropical storm hagupit wong et al 2007 heavy rainfall occurred in southwestern guangdong province china on 13 september 2002 the daily 00 00 24 00 utc rainfall on 13 september 2002 observed by the rain gauge in this area was 163 4 mm in comparison the precipitation measured by trmm was 238 mm and the precipitation predicted by the cnn lstm fusion model was 162 9 mm it can be noted that the proposed cnn lstm fusion model captures the heavy rainfall event well while the original trmm satellite data overestimated the precipitation it can be observed that the spatial distribution of precipitation with the cnn lstm fusion model is basically consistent with that of the original trmm compared with the original trmm the merged precipitation field has less precipitation in the northwest and a lower peak in some parts of the southern region in contrast to the interpolated precipitation field based on meteorological stations trmm overestimates the precipitation in southern china while there are some false positives in northwest china the combined precipitation has a better correction with trmm reducing the high valuation and correcting some false positives its precipitation distribution is closer to that of the observed precipitation therefore using the cnn lstm model can well correct the original trmm satellite precipitation data and the merging of ground gauge data and gridsat b1 infrared satellite image reduces the error of the original trmm data and better reflects the real precipitation field 5 conclusions in this study a spatio temporal deep fusion model for merging trmm gauge precipitation in china is proposed by combining the convolutional neural networks and the long short term memory networks the results show that 1 the cnn lstm model outperformed the comparative models cnn lstm and mlp reducing the rmse and mae of the original trmm data by 17 0 and 14 7 respectively and increasing the correlation coefficient from 0 66 to 0 72 2 the cnn lstm model can correct and improve the original trmm data under different precipitation intensities but it underestimated the peak value of precipitation with high intensity 3 the merged precipitation field reflected the real precipitation well following the deep fusion model a dataset of satellite trmm 3b42 v7 gauge 796 gauges in china merged daily precipitation from 2001 to 2005 with a higher resolution of 0 05 and higher accuracy over china is finally produced by exploring the spatial and temporal dependence between trmm and rain gauge precipitation simultaneously this study provides a useful tool to improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation qpe which will benefit hydrologic simulation and water related disaster prevention the proposed model can be applied and extended to various regions and scenes as a vast amount of satellite and ground data become available credit authorship contribution statement hongcai wu formal analysis methodology visualization writing original draft qinli yang supervision

5627,to improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation qpe numerous models have been developed for merging satellite and gauge precipitation however most established merging methods consider the spatial or temporal correlation between satellite data and rain gauge data separately and the produced merged precipitation is still limited by low spatial resolution and regional inaccuracy in this study a deep fusion model is proposed to merge the trmm 3b42 v7 satellite data rain gauge data and thermal infrared images by exploiting their spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously specifically the convolutional neural network cnn is combined with a long short term memory network lstm where the spatial characteristics of satellite rain gauge and thermal infrared data are extracted by cnn while their time dependence is captured by lstm experiment results on 796 rain gauges in china show that the proposed cnn lstm model outperforms the comparative models cnn lstm multi layer perception it can improve the accuracy of the original trmm data in china reducing the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae by 17 0 and 14 7 respectively and increasing the correlation coefficient to 0 72 even for different precipitation intensities and gauge sparse regions finally a dataset of merged daily precipitation from 2001 to 2005 with a higher resolution of 0 05 and higher accuracy over china is produced this study provides a useful tool and a valuable dataset for qpe in china which would benefit water research and water resource management keywords deep learning satellite gauge merged precipitation quantitative precipitation estimation spatiotemporal fusion model 1 introduction as a crucial component of water cycle precipitation plays important roles in supporting water and energy exchange and connecting biosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and atmosphere gat and airey 2006 the spatial distribution of precipitation is extremely complex and has profound impacts on meteorology and hydrology and their associated processes chen and chung 2015 niu et al 2017 for instance 70 80 of the uncertainty of terrestrial hydrological processes is attributed to the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation syed et al 2004 gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 moreover floods caused by heavy rainfall events and the resulting landslides have become one of the most serious natural disasters in the world jonkman 2005 xu et al 2018 therefore the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation qpe is of great importance for hydrology meteorology climatology agriculture ecology and natural disaster prevention etc however due to the strong multi scale spatiotemporal variability accurate estimation of precipitation still remains challenges precipitation is predominantly measured estimated by rain gauge and satellite remote sensing rain gauge is a traditional yet most reliable way to directly measure precipitation at the earth s surface lanza and stagi 2008 diverse datasets of precipitation products based on in situ observations have been developed on both regional and global scales for example cru ts3 1 monthly grid precipitation dataset global precipitation climatology center datasets and the daily precipitation over east asia xie et al 2007 to mention a few however rain gauge suffers several drawbacks such as poor spatial representation limited space coverage and uneven spatial distribution kidd et al 2017 rana et al 2015 as for china the eastern part has much higher density of rain gauges than that of western china for instance the nearest distance of neighboring gauges is about 10 km in eastern china versus 500 km on the tibetan plateau shen et al 2018 thus the accuracy of gauge based interpolated qpe is highly affected by gauge density in contrast remote sensing infrared ir sensors passive microwave pmw radiometers and precipitation radars based precipitation products show advantages on capturing the spatial pattern and temporal variation of precipitation for vast areas of the globe up to present various satellite based precipitation products have been widely applied such as the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm huffman et al 2007 the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph products joyce et al 2004 and the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann ashouri et al 2015 however large systematic bias and random errors are associated with satellite precipitation products in comparison with the in situ rain gauge data shen et al 2010 to improve the accuracy of the qpe the satellite products and rain gauge data can be combined taking the best of each the accuracy of gauge data and the spatial coverage of satellite data in recent years huge efforts have been made on merging satellite and rain gauge data and a number of merged precipitation products with higher accuracy have become available shi et al 2017 for instance the monthly precipitation estimations on 2 5 grid and the daily precipitation dataset on 1 grid produced by the global precipitation climatology project gpcp liu et al 2016 the cmorph fusion precipitation products developed by the us climate prediction center noaa cpc hussain et al 2018 the gauge satellite merged analysis of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm 3b42 huffman et al 2007 and the global pmw merged precipitation estimate of the cooperative institute for climate studies high resolution optimally interpolated microwave precipitation from satellites joseph et al 2009 particularly trmm version 7 trmm v7 has been verified outperforming the other aforementioned remote sensing precipitation products liu et al 2016 however the adjusted trmm products are still limited by its regional inaccuracy and low spatial resolution a variety of gauge satellite fusion approaches have been proposed which can broadly fall into two categories global correction and local correction the global correction methods include mean bias correction grimes et al 1999 nonparametric kernel smoothing li and shao 2010 probability density function xie and xiong 2011 and linearized weighting procedures woldemeskel et al 2013 the local correction methods refer to co kriging chappell et al 2013 krajewski 1987 regression kriging dinku et al 2014 geographically weighted regression chao et al 2018 bayesian combination nerini et al 2015 todini 2001 and optimal interpolation shen et al 2014 wu et al 2018 xie and xiong 2011 the global methods play a smoothing effect on the overall space without considering the spatial difference of precipitation although the local methods take into account the spatial autocorrelation of precipitation they perform better in regions with denser rain gauges but overestimate in areas with sparse stations and high uncertainty is often associated with the fusion results nerini et al 2015 however most existing satellite gauge fusion methods both the global correction and the local correction methods are traditional mathematical regression models relying on strong assumptions which may be invalid in reality more importantly the established models generally explore the spatial and or temporal correlation patterns between rain gauges and satellite precipitation products separately instead of simultaneously compared with traditional interpolation or regression methods deep learning methods which have stronger learning and generalization abilities have advantages in modeling more complex patterns in data and processing massive amounts of data lecun et al 2015 shao et al 2017b shao et al 2019b aswin et al 2018 chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 oshri et al 2018 shao et al 2015 in recent years deep learning has developed rapidly in the fields of image recognition speech recognition natural language processing as well as precipitation forecasting ha et al 2016 kumar et al 2019 xie et al 2018 shao et al 2017a shao et al 2019a yang et al 2019 for instance convolutional long short term memory network lstm was introduced for radar precipitation forecasting shi et al 2015 qiu et al 2017 applied multi task convolutional neural networks to learn the correlation between time series and sites and then use it for precipitation forecasting ashouri et al 2015 used the artificial neural network to invert original satellite imagery thermal infrared microwave sensor image such as persiann which is a satellite precipitation estimation system based on an artificial neural network model ashouri et al 2015 miao et al 2019 tao et al 2016 in addition the deep neural network dnn is applied to estimate rain and snow rates in high latitudes tang et al 2018 boushaki et al 2009 to the best of our knowledge deep learning has not been explored in the fusion of rain gauge and satellite precipitation in this study we aim to propose a spatiotemporal deep fusion model to yield satellite gauge merged precipitation with higher resolution and higher accuracy in china the objectives of this study include 1 propose a deep fusion model for satellite gauge by combing the convolutional neural network cnn with a long short term memory network lstm 2 taking the trmm and rain gauge data in china as example to verify the efficiency of the proposed cnn lstm model via comparing with other comparative methods 3 produce a satellite gauge merged precipitation dataset with higher resolution and accuracy for china 2 study area and data acquisition 2 1 study area the study area is china located in east asian between 73 135 e and 10 53 n fig 1 china has complex terrain with the altitude ranging from negative eastern plains to higher than 8000 m tibetan plateau water vapor from two main sources pacific ocean and indian ocean are blocked by the tibetan plateau when it climbs from south and east to north and west effected by east asian monsoon and southwest monsoon and topography annual precipitation distribution in china exhibits high variation in space ranging from 100 mm to 2000 m lu et al 2019 and time 60 70 concentrates in flood season liu et al 2016 2 2 data acquisition satellite precipitation data in situ rain gauge data digital elevation model dem and gridded satellite gridsat b1 data are used in this study the basic information of these data sets has been summarized in table 1 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm is the first meteorological satellite dedicated to the observation of tropical and subtropical precipitation launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploratory agency jaxa in november 1997 huffman et al 2007 liu et al 2012 the trmm 3b42 v7 product a level 3 data is used in this study the in situ rain gauge network observation data are from the national surface weather data day value dataset v3 0 provided by china meteorological data service center cmdc it covers sub daily 8 00 20 00 20 00 8 00 the next day precipitation on 816 national meteorological stations in the mainland of china since 1951 to present the distribution of the rain gauges is not uniform most of which are concentrated in the central and eastern china while sparse gauges are located in high altitude areas in western china where the precipitation information is very deficient to keep consistent with the time range and space coverage of trmm and to avoid the gauges with missing data the daily precipitation data on 796 rain gauges as shown in fig 1 between 2001 and 2005 were selected for further study gridded satellite gridsat b1 data derived from merging isccp b1 ir data provides a high quality climate data record cdr of global infrared measurements from geostationary satellites knapp et al 2011 gridsat b1 supplies near global data for three channels the cdr quality infrared window irwin channel near 11 μm the visible channel near 0 6 μm and the infrared water vapor irwvp channel near 6 7 μm the dataset is projected onto a global 0 07 latitude equal angle grid with date coverage spanning from 1st january 1980 to present covering the globe of 70 s 70 n and 180 w 180 e the gridsat b1 irwin brightness temperature data 3 hourly time scale are gridded to a 0 07 spatial resolution the irwin cdr nadir most infrared window observation data are used in this paper besides the digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 90 m is derived from the usgs nasa srtm data 3 methodology the framework of the proposed multi source spatio temporal data fusion model based on deep learning is illustrated in fig 2 the whole process can be divided into three parts 1 data pre processing which includes time alignment downscaling the trmm data to 0 05 and unifying time scale to daily and training data extraction 2 establishing the spatio temporal deep neural network model by combining cnn and lstm 3 precipitation fusion and evaluation during which precipitation is merged and corrected for the study area based on the proposed model and the model performance is quantified via certain evaluation metrics 3 1 data preprocessing firstly the missing data and outliers in the satellite dataset trmm 3b42 v7 and the rain gauge observation dataset are processed for different types of missing values according to their temporal and spatial similarity respectively the time adjacent or spatial proximity value is used for replacement since the satellite data uses utc time and the rain gauges data uses beijing time all data sets need to be time matched then the original trmm s 3hr rainfall rate data are converted to daily cumulative rainfall to obtain a finer spatial distribution of precipitation and to generate more data in a smaller area for convolution operations the trmm data are downscaled to 0 05 by using the nearest neighbor interpolation method which keeps the pixel values and avoids introducing new errors the dem data are resampled to 0 05 by pixel averaging gridsat b1 selects the cdr quality infrared window irwin channel near 11 μm data considering dem and gridsat b1 data have different dimensions which may exert impacts on neural network training they are normalized considering the spatial representation of precipitation for each ground gauge a 7 7 sub grids about 38 5 km 38 5 km centered on it is extracted afterwards the satellite data at the identified corresponding grids on each time step is extracted finally a training dataset corresponding to the satellite grid and the measured precipitation on time and space is established the detailed extraction method is shown in fig 3 3 2 basic deep neural network models the convolutional neural networks cnn can automatically extract important feature information of the image through the view of the convolution kernel and the combined characteristics of the neurons therefore in the field of image recognition the convolutional neural network can obtain better results cnn uses a set of elements distributed at different locations of the image but with the same weight vector to acquire the features of the image and form a feature map at each location cells from different feature maps get their own different types of features therefore it can extract the spatial features of two dimensional data in the estimation of the precipitation field the precipitation information of each point is related to the information around it and this spatial feature information can be obtained through cnn it can automatically learn the spatial dependence of the target grid and the surrounding area by different perceptual domains through a multi layer convolutional neural network the multi layer perception mlp lecun et al 2015 also called artificial neural network mainly includes input layer hidden layer and output layer and the hidden layer can contain multiple layers the mlp layers are fully connected to each other meaning that a neuron in a layer is connected to all cells in the adjacent layers all the parameters are the connection weights and bias when the activation function of the multilayer perceptron is non linear the multilayer perceptron is equivalent to a powerful nonlinear regression model the recurrent neural network rnn is a general term for a series of neural networks that can process sequential data different from the fully connected neural network layer the rnn layer has a feedback connection that allows past information to affect the current output therefore the output of the current time of the rnn layer is the accumulation of its current input and the output of the previous moment through this structure rnn has the ability to remember past information as an improvement to rnn the long short term memory lstm networks are explicitly designed to avoid the long term dependency problem compared to traditional rnns lstm adds four structures cell state input gates forget gates and output gates the cell state is used to store the accumulation of past information the forget gate determines how much of the cell state at the previous moment is retained to the current time the input gate determines how much information of the network input is saved to the cell state at the current time and the output gate determines how much information the cell state outputs formally the formulations are given as follows 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 4 h t o t t a n h c t 5 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 6 c t f t c t 1 i t c t where f t i t o t represent the forget input and output gate c t is the memory cell h is a hidden vector w and b are weight matrix and bias term a b represents connecting two vectors into a longer vector and r e p r e s e n t s the element wise multiplication for precipitation estimation the precipitation information at each time point is related to the precipitation information of its past time the time dependence of precipitation information at different time points can be obtained through lstm 3 3 deep neural network fusion model cnn lstm to model the spatial and temporal correlations between rain gauges and satellite estimations simultaneously cnn is used to learn the spatial characteristics and lstm is applied to capture the time dependence finally a joint spatio temporal deep neural network model by combining cnn and lstm is proposed to merge precipitation data fig 4 illustrates the framework of the proposed model the deep neural network fusion model includes two parts namely the cnn spatial feature extraction module and the lstm module the cnn spatial feature extraction module is configured to extract feature vectors related to precipitation of the center point of the grid from the satellite data in the precipitation fusion precipitation at each spatial location does not exist in isolation but are associated with the surrounding space the use of cnn can extract precipitation information in the area around the target providing a reference for the correction of the current target point it mainly consists of a convolutional layer and a pooled layer with different convolution kernels the activation function uses relu trmm dem and gridsat b1 data are spliced through separate convolutional networks to generate the output of this module the lstm module is used to obtain the time dependence of precipitation for a certain time step precipitation information at the past moment will affect the precipitation at the current moment the past useful information can be retained to the current time by the cell state and gating unit of the lstm the detailed architecture and hyperparameters of the deep neural network fusion model are shown in fig 5 which represents the fusion process of precipitation from the input to the output at a time step t the rounded rectangles represent data input output and intermediate results where the content is the data type and shape the rectangles represent different neural network layers and hyperparameters convolution2d is a 2 dimensional convolution layer followed by the size and number of convolution kernels dropout is a regularization method to prevent overfitting maxpooling is the maximum pooling layer flatten folds tensors into 1 dimensional vectors concatenate layer combines multiple vectors into one according to the specified axis bidirectional lstm is a bidirectional lstm layer dense is a fully connected layer and relu and elu are activation functions the coupling process of cnn and lstum is as follows 1 feature vectors of the trmm dem and gridsat b1 grid data are extracted via separate independent convolutional networks and then combined as the precipitation feature vector at the current moment 2 the precipitation feature vector at each moment is input into the bidirectional lstm to extract the time dependence of the forward and backward directions 3 the fused precipitation at each moment is output through the fully connected network in the proposed cnn lstm model the hyperparameters of each network layer are the optimal choices based on the data size and multiple experiments the fusion algorithm is mainly divided into two steps 1 training model the original trmm data are down scaled for each ground rain gauge the corresponding trrmm satellite data grid is extracted the constructed cnn lstm deep model is used for training to minimize the training loss 2 precipitation merging the trained model is used to correct each grid point of the satellite raster data and finally produce the fusion precipitation field over the entire study area 3 4 evaluation metrics to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed deep fusion model for precipitation merging the dataset from 796 rain gauges was divided into training and test sets by using 10 fold cross validation the performance at each rain gauge is evaluated by using the mean value of the ten trained models for the whole study area the final evaluation is based on the average of all gauges root mean square error rmse relative bias rb mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient cc are selected as the evaluation criteria these indicators are defined by the following equations 7 10 respectively 7 r m s e i 1 n p pre i p obs i 2 n 8 r b i 1 n p pre i p obs i t 1 n p obs i 9 m a e i 1 n p pre i p obs i n 10 c c i 1 n p pre i p pre p obs i p obs i 1 n p pre i p pre 2 i 1 n p obs i p obs 2 where p pre i and p obs i denote the predicted and the observed precipitation respectively p pre and p obs are the mean of the predicted and observed precipitation respectively n is the number of all observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 precipitation fusion performance using different models precipitation data from 796 meteorological stations were randomly divided into ten parts by using ten fold cross validation nine of which are used for training and the remaining one is used for testing at each time in order to illustrate the priority of the proposed cnn lstm model cnn model lstm model and mlp multi layer perception model were selected for comparison the performances of different models on precipitation fusion are shown in table 2 the quantitative comparison between the data fusion results and the original trmm indicates that the improvement of the mlp model is minimal that might because the mlp only nonlinearly fits the satellite data and the gauge data but does not consider their temporal and spatial correlation when cnn is used the error is significantly lower than that of mlp indicating that spatial information has a significant improvement in precipitation fusion when lstm is used alone which means that only the time dependence of precipitation is considered the error is also significantly reduced therefore the time correlation of precipitation also significantly improves precipitation fusion the cnn lstm model fully considers the dependence of precipitation on both time and space outperforming the comparable models the rmse is 1 88 mm d lower than the original trmm data and the correlation coefficient is improved from 0 66 to 0 72 it can be concluded from the relative bias that the original trmm data overestimates the precipitation which is consistent with the results of other researchers qin et al 2014 the rb of the merged precipitation reduces to 8 8 which underestimates the precipitation spatial distributions of metrics for original trmm and cnn lstm fusion daily precipitation over mainland china are shown in fig 6 based on the observations of the ground stations the original trmm and cnn lstm fusion models precipitation were calculated for cc rmse and mae at each gauge and the gauge values were interpolated into others using linear interpolation to obtain the spatial distribution of the metrics as can be seen from fig 6 the correlation coefficient of the fusion model is significantly improved in most areas and the rmse and mae also have a significant decline especially in the southeast coastal areas however cc is a little lower in the northwest even below 0 2 several possible factors are 1 the climate and topography in north western china are complex while satellites cannot obtain the accurate precipitation characteristics 2 there are so few gauges in the region that it is impossible to accurately measure the error with real precipitation the distributions of rmse and mae are also related to the intensity of precipitation showing a lower northwest and a higher southeast 4 2 fusion model performance under different precipitation intensities the error between the estimated and observed precipitation may differ under different precipitation intensities quantitative evaluation of error distribution under different precipitation intensities can better evaluate the fusion precipitation products table 3 shows the errors of the original trmm and the fusion product under four different precipitation intensities it can be found that the rmse and mae of cnn lstm fusion precipitation are significantly lower than those of the original trmm the probability of detection pod is significantly improved under different rainfall intensities for instance when the precipitation intensities are 0 1 5 mm d 5 10 mm d 10 25 mm d the rmse are reduced by 1 955 mm d 3 875 mm d 4 879 mm d respectively and the pod increased by 14 15 and 10 respectively however the error of the fusion precipitation increases when the precipitation intensity is greater than 25 mm d the main reason may be that the cnn lstm fusion model does not estimate the precipitation peaks but it is still better than the original trmm data it can be concluded that the cnn lstm fusion model can correct and improve the original trmm data under different precipitation intensities 4 3 spatial distribution of the merged precipitation following the proposed cnn lstm model the dataset of daily precipitation from 2001 to 2005 with a resolution of 0 05 in china is produced during the final precipitation fusion in order to obtain as many precipitation patterns as possible the deep neural network will be trained using data from all rain gauges for illustration fig 7 shows the precipitation fields of the original trmm downscaling trmm cnn lstm model production and the gauges interpolation on 13 september 2002 due to the impact of tropical storm hagupit wong et al 2007 heavy rainfall occurred in southwestern guangdong province china on 13 september 2002 the daily 00 00 24 00 utc rainfall on 13 september 2002 observed by the rain gauge in this area was 163 4 mm in comparison the precipitation measured by trmm was 238 mm and the precipitation predicted by the cnn lstm fusion model was 162 9 mm it can be noted that the proposed cnn lstm fusion model captures the heavy rainfall event well while the original trmm satellite data overestimated the precipitation it can be observed that the spatial distribution of precipitation with the cnn lstm fusion model is basically consistent with that of the original trmm compared with the original trmm the merged precipitation field has less precipitation in the northwest and a lower peak in some parts of the southern region in contrast to the interpolated precipitation field based on meteorological stations trmm overestimates the precipitation in southern china while there are some false positives in northwest china the combined precipitation has a better correction with trmm reducing the high valuation and correcting some false positives its precipitation distribution is closer to that of the observed precipitation therefore using the cnn lstm model can well correct the original trmm satellite precipitation data and the merging of ground gauge data and gridsat b1 infrared satellite image reduces the error of the original trmm data and better reflects the real precipitation field 5 conclusions in this study a spatio temporal deep fusion model for merging trmm gauge precipitation in china is proposed by combining the convolutional neural networks and the long short term memory networks the results show that 1 the cnn lstm model outperformed the comparative models cnn lstm and mlp reducing the rmse and mae of the original trmm data by 17 0 and 14 7 respectively and increasing the correlation coefficient from 0 66 to 0 72 2 the cnn lstm model can correct and improve the original trmm data under different precipitation intensities but it underestimated the peak value of precipitation with high intensity 3 the merged precipitation field reflected the real precipitation well following the deep fusion model a dataset of satellite trmm 3b42 v7 gauge 796 gauges in china merged daily precipitation from 2001 to 2005 with a higher resolution of 0 05 and higher accuracy over china is finally produced by exploring the spatial and temporal dependence between trmm and rain gauge precipitation simultaneously this study provides a useful tool to improve the accuracy of quantitative precipitation estimation qpe which will benefit hydrologic simulation and water related disaster prevention the proposed model can be applied and extended to various regions and scenes as a vast amount of satellite and ground data become available credit authorship contribution statement hongcai wu formal analysis methodology visualization writing original draft qinli yang supervision

5628,rainfall is one of the main inputs to the soil and water assessment tool swat model any error in the rainfall data could transfer to the model outputs and lead to inaccurate judgements and decisions this study aims to evaluate the effect of spatial station number and location effect and temporal randomly and selective missing values rainfall scarcities on swat streamflow simulations a total of 58 rainfall data scarcity scenarios was incorporated into a calibrated swat model to test the effect on monthly streamflow simulations of the kelantan river basin krb malaysia during the period of 1980 to 1999 this study provides new insights of rainfall station distance missing values in specific periods and different streamflow intensities elements on swat based rainfall data scarcity swat rainfall assessment framework with new evaluation indicators of extreme flows trend and magnitude changes analysis the results show that 1 a minimum of four stations is needed to achieve accurate monthly streamflow in the krb 2 distance of rainfall stations to the streamflow station has a considerable impact on swat modelling 3 temporal rainfall scarcity has a large impact on general and extreme streamflow simulations compared to spatial rainfall scarcity 4 missing rainfall values of more than 20 in rainfall data would significantly affect tropical streamflow simulation 5 the impact of missing rainfall values during the high flow period is lower than those in the moderate and low flow periods and 6 excessive missing value in rainfall data would lead to errors in trend analysis a special caution need to be taken in the selection and pre processing of rainfall data before their incorporation into swat future works include integration of satellite precipitation products in swat improvement of swat weather generator and development of a swat based rainfall data pre processing scheme to reduce rainfall data uncertainty keywords swat rainfall scarcity missing tropical malaysia 1 introduction hydrological models have been extensively applied to understand the regional hydrological component changes due to changes in land use and climate guzha et al 2018 chen et al 2019b tan et al 2017c such information is vital for water resources management and environmental conservation good quality climate and geospatial data such as rainfall temperature topography land use and soil maps are the basic inputs for hydrological modelling on top of that the role of data sets is more than just basic inputs because they act as an ultimate source for hydrologic landscape interpretation mcglynn et al 2013 moreover the accuracy of hydrological model depends on how well input parameters represent the basin s characteristic fitzhugh and mackay 2000 as a key component of hydrological cycle rainfall is the most important input to hydrological model shen et al 2012 rainfall data can be measured using rain gauges weather radar and satellite sensors zeng et al 2018 rain gauges provide accurate data at point form while weather radar and satellites observe areal rainfall merging of two or more different rainfall dataset can sometime produce a better spatially distributed rainfall data shi et al 2020 satellite precipitation products spps are beneficial due to their huge coverage with continuous measurement up to hourly scale tan and santo 2018 but less accurate as compared to rain gauges ground based weather radar could provide rainfall information at the effective range of 40 to 200 km world meteorological organization 2008 however application of rainfall data measured from ground based weather radar in hydrological modelling is not common due to its limited accessibility to public range effects beam blockage z r relationship variability and signal attenuation in general rainfall data from a well distributed rain gauge network is still a fundamental source in hydrological modelling tan et al 2019b dakhlalla and parajuli 2016 it also provides reference values for validating and correcting spps and ground based weather radar world meteorological organization 2008 recommended the following minimum rainfall gauge densities in various types of physiographic regions e g 900 km2 gauge for coastal area 575 km2 gauge for interior plains 250 km2 gauge for mountains 25 km2 gauge for small islands and 10 20 km2 gauge for urban areas the number of missing rainfall observations for hydrological modelling should also be kept less than 10 however the recommendation has not been fully followed because modelers often face rainfall data scarcity problem due to the heterogeneous network distribution instrument malfunction funding shortage low awareness of local authorities unstable political situation and human error several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of rain gauge density distribution and missing values in hydrological modelling zeng et al 2018 xu et al 2013 most of the studies concluded a higher number of rainfall gauges could considerably improve the accuracy of hydrological modelling as the soil and water assessment tool swat model is among the most popular hydrological models tan et al 2019a gassman and wang 2015 mannschatz et al 2016 understanding of different rain gauge scarcity scenarios on the swat outputs is vital to minimize the model biases galván et al 2014 mentioned that rainfall data is very important in driving surface runoff and contamination transport as well as to reproduce the water budget within swat chaplot et al 2005 found that swat simulated streamflow and nitrogen flux varied slightly with increasing of rainfall gauges while the sediment output showed a significant improvement a similar study in the little river watershed showed the swat based total phosphorus simulation is highly sensitive to the number of rain gauges followed by sediment total nitrogen and streamflow cho et al 2009 chaplot 2014 reported that streamflow and nitrates simulation using swat is more sensitive to the number of rainfall gauges in humid watersheds aouissi et al 2018 evaluated the spatial scarcity of rainfall data with different basin delineation area threshold values in a small semi arid river basin they concluded identification of a good combination of rain gauges and hrus is needed before swat calibration chen et al 2019a found a poorer swat performance when high missing rainfall values during low flow periods previous studies were concentrated on assessing the impact of spatial rainfall whereas the combined impacts of spatial and temporal missing value scarcity of rainfall gauge data have been rarely discussed chen et al 2018b particularly in tropical region development of a comprehensive swat based rainfall data scarcity swat rainfall assessment framework is therefore important to evaluate the impact of both the spatial and temporal rainfall scarcity on swat outputs more accurately the objectives of this study include 1 to quantify the effect of spatial rainfall scarcity station number single station and location effect on swat outputs 2 to quantify the effect of temporal rainfall scarcity randomly and selectively missing values on swat outputs and 3 to introduce new indicators extreme simulation trend and magnitude analysis for swat based rainfall data scarcity evaluation to the best of our knowledge rainfall data scarcity conditions such as the effect of rainfall station distance to streamflow station missing values in specific calibration and validation periods have yet been considered in previous studies moreover we further evaluated the effect of rainfall data scarcity in extreme flow simulations 2 study area data 2 1 kelantan river basin this study was carried out in the kelantan river basin krb a tropical basin that located in the north eastern part of peninsular malaysia which is near to the equator fig 1 it is frequently affected by monsoon floods in november to january and drought during march to may it is selected as the study site due to its tropical rainforest climate characteristics warm with high and frequent rainfall and availability of high quality long term rainfall data many stations with less than 1 of missing values therefore krb could serve as a good comparative site for watersheds with different climate conditions another important reason for selecting krb is that swat is already established and well proven applicable in this basin tan et al 2018b tan et al 2017c the swat rainfall framework could be readily applied in different types of river basins once it is established and proven applicable in krb krb covers an area of approximately 12 685 km2 with the main river length of 248 km the basin elevation ranges from 2174 a m s l in the western and south western regions to 2 a m s l in the middle and northern regions tan et al 2017c major land use and land cover types of the basin are forest oil palm and rubber plantations krb receives a high annual precipitation ranging from 2000 mm year to 3200 mm year for the period of 1985 to 2014 tan et al 2017b heavy precipitation is normally found during the early northeast monsoon nem period in november and december up to 400 mm month whereas lower amount of monthly precipitation in krb is normally recorded in february to april 2 2 data for a comprehensive assessment we only considered the rainfall stations with less than 1 of missing values daily rainfall at nine climate stations from 1978 to 1999 were collected from the malaysian meteorological department fig 1 and table 1 most of the gauges have less than 0 1 missing values except for the pejabat haiwan jajahan machang station with the highest missing values of 0 54 we still included the station because it contains long term daily maximum and minimum temperature data that needed for swat model development missing values were then filled with the rainfall data of the nearest station the effect of missing values filling is negligible as most of the stations have no missing values a 90 m digital elevation model dem of shuttle radar topography mission srtm was used for river formation basin and sub basins delineation in swat modelling as proven by tan et al 2018a application of srtm dem could yield a better swat simulation in krb compared to other dem products such as the advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster dem river network in spatial format was collected from the department of irrigation and drainage did malaysia to integrate with the dem data for better river network formation monthly streamflow at jambatan guillermard from 1980 to 1999 was collected from the same department for swat calibration and validation land use and soil maps were collected from ministry of agriculture and agro based industries moa malaysia 3 methodology 3 1 swat model swat is a basin scale physically based and semi distributed hydrological model that operates on continuous time scale at sub daily and daily time steps arnold et al 1998 the model was designed to simulate the effects of different soil land use and agricultural management practices within basins by the u s department of agricultural and the texas a m university within swat a basin is divided into numerous sub basins which are then further divided into hydrological response unit hrus in this study the soil conservation service scs hargreaves and kinematic storage approaches were selected to estimate surface runoff evapotranspiration and channel routing respectively a detailed explanation of swat can be found in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 to capture the orographic precipitation swat applies up to 10 elevations bands in each sub basin as shown in fig 1 the orographic effect is mainly found in the west and southwestern regions of the basin a weather generator is plugged in the swat model to fill the missing values in rainfall data it uses a first order markov chain model to differentiate wet and dry day through a comparison between the model generated random numbers and user defined monthly wet dry probabilities neitsch et al 2011 rainfall amount of missing wet days are then generated by either the skewed distribution or modified exponential distribution the latter distribution is commonly used in limited data condition as it requires fewer inputs the skewed distribution eqs 2 and 3 and modified exponential distribution eq 4 equations are available as follows 2 r day μ mon 2 σ mon sn d day g mon 6 g mon 6 1 3 1 g mon 3 sn d day cos 6 283 r n d 2 2 ln rn d 1 4 r day μ mon ln r n d 1 r exp where μ mon and σ mon are the average and standard deviation of daily precipitation for the month respectively sn d day is the standard normal deviation for the specific day g mon is the skew coefficient of daily precipitation for the month rn d 1 and rn d 2 are random number from 0 to 1 r exp is an exponent value between 1 and 2 higher r exp value indicates more extreme rainfall events in the year 3 2 rainfall scarcity scenarios in the study one baseline s1 and 57 scenarios considering both the spatial s2 to s31 and temporal s32 to s58 rainfall scarcity were created and could be found in table 2 baseline is a combination of daily rainfall data from all the nine rain gauges and daily maximum and minimum temperature data from the pejabat haiwan jajahan machang station the s2 to s8 scenarios considered the reduced number of rainfall gauges starting with the station located farthest from the streamflow gauge while the s9 to s15 scenarios firstly removed the station nearest to the streamflow gauge the s2 to s15 scenarios were used to study how the rain gauge distance and number affect the swat outputs the s16 to s24 scenarios were designed to study whether single rain gauge is sufficient for swat modelling whereas spatial scarcity in rainfall gauge distribution or location effect situation was evaluated using the s2 s9 and s25 to s31 scenarios for example removal of the pos lebir station located in the southeast region of the basin as represented with the s28 scenario could help understand the effect of limiting rain gauges to the western region chen et al 2018b designed two types of temporal data scarcity situations for their evaluation 1 increasing missing rainfall values between 10 and 60 and 2 removing high low and normal flow events of specific years we further improved the temporal rainfall data scarcity scenarios by randomly selecting the missing values from 10 to 50 for calibration validation and entire periods separately s32 to s46 this can be used to study how missing values of different time slices could influence the swat modelling besides that a new missing values selection scheme was designed by classifying streamflow into 12 different categories daily rainfall data for each category of streamflow events were removed s47 to s58 to see how missing rainfall data for different flow intensities could affect swat simulations fig 2 shows the artificial missing values of temporal scarcity scenarios s32 to s58 designed for this study which were applied to all the rainfall stations the overall swat rainfall framework is shown in fig 3 3 3 swat setup with an area threshold of 200 km2 krb was divided into 39 sub basins and 203 hrus swat has been successfully applied in krb for various applications such as climate change tan et al 2017c spps reliability validation tan et al 2017a 2018b and dem input uncertainty tan et al 2018a groundwater revap coefficient gw revap baseflow alpha factor alpha bf and channel effective hydraulic conductivity ch k2 are found to be the most sensitive parameters in krb tan et al 2018b swat is capable to simulate daily streamflow accurately with the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 84 and 0 74 for calibration and validation respectively detailed description of the parameters sensitivity analysis calibration and validation can be found in these studies the well defined appropriate parameters ranges were directly applied for calibration 1980 to 1989 and validation 1990 to 1999 purposes in the baseline s1 with the first two years 1978 to 1999 as the warm up period we still run the swat calibration using the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 approach because the rain gauge network was different from previous studies the parameters ranges and finally fitted values generated can be found in table 2 there is no further discussion on the swat parameters sensitivity analysis as this study is only concentrated on sensitivity analysis of rain gauge data moreover other swat inputs i e land use soil and dem and simulation setting i e swat parameters drainage area threshold and hydrological components calculation approach were unchanged to minimize the disruption of other sources of uncertainty tan et al 2018a xu et al 2016 the performance of swat simulated under the 58 different rainfall scarcity scenarios table 2 were evaluated using nse and coefficient of determination r2 nse and r2 are the most commonly used statistical metrics to judge the success of swat simulation described in detail with evaluation guidelines by moriasi et al 2007 many swat reviews extracted nse and r2 values to summarize the overall performance of swat from their selected publications bressiani et al 2015 gassman et al 2014 tan et al 2019a in general nse defines how well the plot between observed and simulated data fits 1 1 line while r2 determines the degree of collinearity of observed and simulated data based on moriasi et al 2015 monthly swat simulated streamflow can be judged as satisfactory if 0 60 r2 0 75 and 0 50 nse 0 70 good if 0 75 r2 0 85 and 0 70 nse 0 80 and very good if r2 0 85 and nse 0 80 measurement of nse and r2 values between monthly observed and simulated flows was conducted for calibration 1980 to 1989 validation 1990 to 1999 and entire period 1980 to 1999 for a comprehensive assessment apart from the common performance assessment we also tried to understand how the rainfall data scarcity could influence the streamflow trend and magnitude analysis it is frequently applied in long hydro climatic series assessment and is important for water resources management a special caution needs to be taken if a significant increasing or decreasing trend is identified to the best of authors knowledge the streamflow trend and magnitude analysis is yet to be considered in any swat based rainfall scarcity studies mann kendall trend test is the most famous approach to detect changes of any hydro climatic time series the null hypothesis for mann kendall trend test is that there is no trend while the alternative hypothesis indicates there is either an increasing or decreasing trend for serially correlated data a modified mann kendall test using hamed and rao 1998 variance correction approach was used sen s slope test is widely used to capture the magnitude of streamflow in simpler words sen s slope tells on average how much streamflow has changed every year mann kendall and sen s slope values for the 58 scenarios table 2 were calculated using a r package called modified versions of mann kendall and spearman s rho trend tests modifiedmk more details on calculation of mann kendall and sen s slope are available in previous studies hamed and rao 1998 tan et al 2017b gocic and trajkovic 2013 4 results 4 1 effect of rain gauge data density the nse and r2 values for streamflow simulations under the 58 rainfall scarcity scenarios for the periods of calibration 1980 1989 validation 1990 1999 and overall 1980 1999 were listed in table 3 fig 4 shows the comparison between observed and simulated monthly streamflow for the krb from 1980 to 1999 the baseline scenario simulation had a good performance nse 0 78 and r2 0 81 in the calibration period and satisfactory performance in both the validation nse 0 60 and r2 0 78 and overall nse 0 60 and r2 0 78 periods this finding is consistent with tan et al 2017c and tan et al 2018b who reported satisfactory and good performance of swat modelling in the same basin rainfall station number has a significant impact on the swat modelling as for the s2 to s15 scenarios the nse and r2 values decreased from 0 71 to 0 49 and 0 76 to 0 42 respectively this shows that the performance of hydrological model reduced with the decreasing number of rainfall stations supporting conclusions of previous studies xue et al 2018 xu et al 2013 in krb the minimum number of station required to achieve satisfactory swat performance is four s6 these stations are not necessarily distributed evenly across the basin but at least one station should be close to the streamflow station poor performance could be clearly observed for the scenarios with less than three rainfall stations as shown in the statistical values of the s7 s8 and s14 to s24 scenarios negative values for nse during the calibration validation and entire periods for the s16 to s24 scenarios indicate that a single rainfall station simulation is insufficient for swat modelling on top of that fig 4 c shows the one gauge scenarios have significantly underestimated the high normal and low flows at the jambatan guillermard streamflow station therefore swat cannot be built with only one station even it is located closely to the streamflow station for example although the pejabat haiwan jajahan machang climate station s24 is just about 5 km from the streamflow station the sole use of its rainfall records still led to a poor simulation performance 4 2 effect of rain gauge data distribution distribution of the rainfall stations over krb can be divided into three major groups 1 lower basin the pejabat haiwan jajahan machang station that is nearest to the outlet and directly drains to the kelantan river 2 upper basin 1 seven stations located in the western and south western regions that mainly contribute to the galas river and 3 upper basin 2 the pos lebir station located around the lebir river in the south eastern part fig 1 removal of the post lebir station s25 caused a slight reduction of nse and r2 from 0 69 to 0 67 and 0 76 to 0 71 respectively in contrast removal of the pejabat haiwan jajahahan machang station has a larger impact on overall streamflow simulation with nse and r2 reduced to 0 57 and 0 61 respectively but the performance of the swat model is still under the satisfactory category as recommended by moriasi et al 2015 a comparison of the nse and r2 values between the s2 to s8 scenarios and the s9 to s15 scenarios was conducted to identify how station distance could influence the swat outputs basically the s2 to s8 scenarios performed better than the s9 to s15 scenarios showing station distance to the outlet used for calibration and validation had certainly influenced the modelling it can be seen that when the number of rainfall station is limited adding a station near the outlet will improve swat performance for instance the performance of swat under the s6 scenario removal of five farthest rainfall stations was better than the s13 scenario removal of five nearest rainfall stations as shown in table 3 this result may be due to the outlet s streamflow is largely contributed by surrounding rainfall surprisingly removal of four farthest closely located stations s5 in the upper south western part yielded a better modelling output because the swat performance was good for all the three calibration validation and overall periods assessment table 3 a possible explanation for this might be due to the uneven distribution of rainfall stations where most of them are concentrated on one side of the basin fig 1 this also accords with zeng et al 2018 which showed a large number of rainfall stations with uneven distribution were unable to support a good hydrological modelling 4 3 effect of missing rain gauge data as mentioned earlier in section 3 2 this study is among the limited studies evaluating how the missing values would impact the swat modelling the main novelty of this study is that we created the missing value scenarios with both random s32 to s46 and selective s47 to s58 schemes 10 to 50 of rainfall records were randomly selected and denoted as missing in the calibration s32 to s36 validation s37 to s41 and overall s42 to s46 periods respectively table 3 listed the statistics of the scenarios the results show that the occurrence of missing values in the calibration period 1980 1989 had only minor impact on streamflow simulation in the validation period 1990 1999 a similar situation was found for the impact of missing rainfall values in the validation period s37 to s41 however under the scenarios with missing values throughout the modelling period the simulated streamflow seems to become mismatched with the observed streamflow in addition results in table 3 have also indicated that more than 20 of missing values may significantly affect swat simulations results this outcome is somewhat different from chen et al 2018b which identified 60 as the critical threshold to cause poor swat performance in the daning river watershed of china this inconsistency may be due to the distinctly difference in climate and geographical i e land use and soil conditions between krb and daning river watershed krb has a higher rainfall variability than daning river watershed because of its tropical climate system average annual rainfall of krb 2500 mm year is much higher than the daning river watershed 1500 mm year moreover there are more rainfall days in the krb than the daning river watershed which would increase the uncertainty of the missing value filling scheme built in swat therefore missing values in rainfall records would have a higher impact on swat modelling in tropical region this study is one of the few examining how missing values of rainfall during high s47 s50 low s51 s54 and normal s55 s58 flows periods could affect the swat modelling interestingly a good swat performance was found for the scenarios with missing rainfall values in the high flow periods of more than 1500 m3 s table 3 meanwhile missing rainfall in the low and normal flow periods could lead to a more negative impact on swat simulated streamflow for example removal of missing rainfall values in the low flow periods of less than 500 m3 s resulted in the nse values of 30 22 28 87 and 29 56 for the calibration validation and overall periods respectively this result may be explained by the higher percentages of missing values in the low and moderate flows period compared to the high flow period as shown in fig 2 fig 4 f shows that missing rainfall values in the periods of different streamflow intensities would all lead to overestimation of streamflow probably due to the tendency of rainfall overestimation by the swat built in weather generator chen et al 2018b 5 discussion rainfall is one of the most important inputs to swat but also a major error source for inaccurate simulations tan et al 2017a ruan et al 2017 according to the results rainfall data scarcity had a considerable effect on swat simulation particularly missing rainfall value thus a special caution should be given on the rainfall data scarcity before building the swat model to improve the accuracy of swat modelling two criteria of rainfall station selection should be followed 1 low number of missing values if possible less than 10 and 2 include station located closely to the outlet another possible solution is application of satellite precipitation products spps to replace rainfall data with severe scarcity problem spps could be considered to avoid the rainfall data scarcity problem due to their huge coverage and continuous measurement capability application of spps in hydrological modelling is getting popular recently and their capability is well proven in many regions tan and santo 2018 wang et al 2017 zubieta et al 2017 for instance integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg spps under the global precipitation mission gpm covers the regions of 68os to 68on with a very high spatial resolution of 0 1 and temporal resolutions of 30 min are potential to substitute the traditional rainfall stations in swat modelling tan et al 2018b mohammed et al 2018 hou et al 2014 imerg spps could be used to study the flood pattern or forecasting as one of the imerg products is available near real time lack of high quality long term climate data to calculate the statistical parameters required in the weather generator of swat is a common issue around the world a direct application of the national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr which are available at the swat website for the calculation might also lead to errors many studies have proved that the ncep cfsr rainfall data were unable to provide accurate swat modelling tan et al 2017a chen et al 2018a hence it is not suitable for calculating the statistical parameters essential to missing value filling in swat improvement of the missing value filing by the weather generator is in urgent need in future research to improve the quality of hydro climatic modelling besides that swat modeler may fill the missing rainfall values with more reliable approach before using them as swat inputs to reduce the uncertainty of the weather generator within swat however the missing value filling should only be conducted at rainfall stations whose missing values are under the critical threshold fig 5 shows the flow duration curve as simulated under various rainfall data scarcity scenarios as illustrated in fig 5 c limiting rainfall inputs to a single rainfall station led to a significant underestimation of both peak and low flows in krb this is probably because the rainfall interpolation scheme in swat is unable to interpolate a single rainfall station meanwhile missing rainfall value led to overestimating the peak and low flows in the krb as a result excessive missing rainfall values may cause much uncertainty in extreme flow simulations we further evaluated how the rainfall data scarcity could affect the results of trend and magnitude change analysis fig 6 in general changes in the number and distribution of stations have not shown a significant impact on streamflow trend and magnitude analysis by contrast missing rainfall values may lead to an opposite streamflow trend for example monthly streamflow as simulated under the s33 to s37 scenarios exhibited a decreasing trend with rates of 3 11 m3 s to 77 68 m3 s whereas the baseline scenario showed an increasing trend of 14 44 m3 s 6 conclusions streamflow simulation performance by swat was assessed under 58 different rainfall data scarcity scenarios in a tropical river basin the 58 scenarios were carefully designed to reflect the spatial station number and location effect and temporal random and selective missing values rainfall scarcity patterns the main contribution of this study is that we consider the effect of distance between rainfall and streamflow stations which were seldom reported in previous studies moreover this is among the few studies examining the effect of missing rainfall values of different periods of modelling i e calibration and validation as well as streamflow intensities low moderate and high flows on swat modelling more evaluation indicators such as flow duration curve trend and magnitude change analysis were added in the swat rainfall framework for a more comprehensive analysis the number of rainfall stations has a considerable impact on swat streamflow simulation as its performance reduced with the decreasing number of rainfall station the minimum number of rainfall stations to achieve a satisfactory swat performance in krb is four while at least one station should be located close to the streamflow station the study found that the use of a single rainfall station would lead to erroneous swat simulations of all the high normal and low flows for trend and magnitude analysis both the number and distribution of rainfall stations had less impact on the swat streamflow simulations than the degree of rainfall missing value the most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that occurrences of missing values in the calibration period 1980 1989 had only a little impact on streamflow simulation in the validation period 1990 1999 with the condition that swat has already been well calibrated in previous studies however missing value in either calibration nor validation periods would significantly reduce the overall period 1980 1999 performance besides that the newly determined missing rainfall value threshold of 20 required for satisfactory streamflow modelling in tropical region should help modelers in their efforts of optimizing rainfall data collection and preparation to increase swat modelling effectiveness besides that excessive missing rainfall value would lead to the overestimation of extreme flows and detection of false trend in the krb therefore a special caution should be exerted on controlling missing rainfall values to improve swat modelling a further study could assess the capability of spps in swat modelling to avoid the rainfall scarcity issue particularly in ungauged basins tan et al 2018b yuan et al 2017 merging of rainfall data from spps and rain gauges could solve the problems of insufficient rainfall stations and missing values further research should also focus on improvement of the weather generator within the swat model by considering lack of reliable long term climate data for the climate parameters calculation another future research need is development of a swat based rainfall data pre processing scheme to fill the missing value with better approaches credit authorship contribution statement mou leong tan conceptualization methodology

5628,rainfall is one of the main inputs to the soil and water assessment tool swat model any error in the rainfall data could transfer to the model outputs and lead to inaccurate judgements and decisions this study aims to evaluate the effect of spatial station number and location effect and temporal randomly and selective missing values rainfall scarcities on swat streamflow simulations a total of 58 rainfall data scarcity scenarios was incorporated into a calibrated swat model to test the effect on monthly streamflow simulations of the kelantan river basin krb malaysia during the period of 1980 to 1999 this study provides new insights of rainfall station distance missing values in specific periods and different streamflow intensities elements on swat based rainfall data scarcity swat rainfall assessment framework with new evaluation indicators of extreme flows trend and magnitude changes analysis the results show that 1 a minimum of four stations is needed to achieve accurate monthly streamflow in the krb 2 distance of rainfall stations to the streamflow station has a considerable impact on swat modelling 3 temporal rainfall scarcity has a large impact on general and extreme streamflow simulations compared to spatial rainfall scarcity 4 missing rainfall values of more than 20 in rainfall data would significantly affect tropical streamflow simulation 5 the impact of missing rainfall values during the high flow period is lower than those in the moderate and low flow periods and 6 excessive missing value in rainfall data would lead to errors in trend analysis a special caution need to be taken in the selection and pre processing of rainfall data before their incorporation into swat future works include integration of satellite precipitation products in swat improvement of swat weather generator and development of a swat based rainfall data pre processing scheme to reduce rainfall data uncertainty keywords swat rainfall scarcity missing tropical malaysia 1 introduction hydrological models have been extensively applied to understand the regional hydrological component changes due to changes in land use and climate guzha et al 2018 chen et al 2019b tan et al 2017c such information is vital for water resources management and environmental conservation good quality climate and geospatial data such as rainfall temperature topography land use and soil maps are the basic inputs for hydrological modelling on top of that the role of data sets is more than just basic inputs because they act as an ultimate source for hydrologic landscape interpretation mcglynn et al 2013 moreover the accuracy of hydrological model depends on how well input parameters represent the basin s characteristic fitzhugh and mackay 2000 as a key component of hydrological cycle rainfall is the most important input to hydrological model shen et al 2012 rainfall data can be measured using rain gauges weather radar and satellite sensors zeng et al 2018 rain gauges provide accurate data at point form while weather radar and satellites observe areal rainfall merging of two or more different rainfall dataset can sometime produce a better spatially distributed rainfall data shi et al 2020 satellite precipitation products spps are beneficial due to their huge coverage with continuous measurement up to hourly scale tan and santo 2018 but less accurate as compared to rain gauges ground based weather radar could provide rainfall information at the effective range of 40 to 200 km world meteorological organization 2008 however application of rainfall data measured from ground based weather radar in hydrological modelling is not common due to its limited accessibility to public range effects beam blockage z r relationship variability and signal attenuation in general rainfall data from a well distributed rain gauge network is still a fundamental source in hydrological modelling tan et al 2019b dakhlalla and parajuli 2016 it also provides reference values for validating and correcting spps and ground based weather radar world meteorological organization 2008 recommended the following minimum rainfall gauge densities in various types of physiographic regions e g 900 km2 gauge for coastal area 575 km2 gauge for interior plains 250 km2 gauge for mountains 25 km2 gauge for small islands and 10 20 km2 gauge for urban areas the number of missing rainfall observations for hydrological modelling should also be kept less than 10 however the recommendation has not been fully followed because modelers often face rainfall data scarcity problem due to the heterogeneous network distribution instrument malfunction funding shortage low awareness of local authorities unstable political situation and human error several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of rain gauge density distribution and missing values in hydrological modelling zeng et al 2018 xu et al 2013 most of the studies concluded a higher number of rainfall gauges could considerably improve the accuracy of hydrological modelling as the soil and water assessment tool swat model is among the most popular hydrological models tan et al 2019a gassman and wang 2015 mannschatz et al 2016 understanding of different rain gauge scarcity scenarios on the swat outputs is vital to minimize the model biases galván et al 2014 mentioned that rainfall data is very important in driving surface runoff and contamination transport as well as to reproduce the water budget within swat chaplot et al 2005 found that swat simulated streamflow and nitrogen flux varied slightly with increasing of rainfall gauges while the sediment output showed a significant improvement a similar study in the little river watershed showed the swat based total phosphorus simulation is highly sensitive to the number of rain gauges followed by sediment total nitrogen and streamflow cho et al 2009 chaplot 2014 reported that streamflow and nitrates simulation using swat is more sensitive to the number of rainfall gauges in humid watersheds aouissi et al 2018 evaluated the spatial scarcity of rainfall data with different basin delineation area threshold values in a small semi arid river basin they concluded identification of a good combination of rain gauges and hrus is needed before swat calibration chen et al 2019a found a poorer swat performance when high missing rainfall values during low flow periods previous studies were concentrated on assessing the impact of spatial rainfall whereas the combined impacts of spatial and temporal missing value scarcity of rainfall gauge data have been rarely discussed chen et al 2018b particularly in tropical region development of a comprehensive swat based rainfall data scarcity swat rainfall assessment framework is therefore important to evaluate the impact of both the spatial and temporal rainfall scarcity on swat outputs more accurately the objectives of this study include 1 to quantify the effect of spatial rainfall scarcity station number single station and location effect on swat outputs 2 to quantify the effect of temporal rainfall scarcity randomly and selectively missing values on swat outputs and 3 to introduce new indicators extreme simulation trend and magnitude analysis for swat based rainfall data scarcity evaluation to the best of our knowledge rainfall data scarcity conditions such as the effect of rainfall station distance to streamflow station missing values in specific calibration and validation periods have yet been considered in previous studies moreover we further evaluated the effect of rainfall data scarcity in extreme flow simulations 2 study area data 2 1 kelantan river basin this study was carried out in the kelantan river basin krb a tropical basin that located in the north eastern part of peninsular malaysia which is near to the equator fig 1 it is frequently affected by monsoon floods in november to january and drought during march to may it is selected as the study site due to its tropical rainforest climate characteristics warm with high and frequent rainfall and availability of high quality long term rainfall data many stations with less than 1 of missing values therefore krb could serve as a good comparative site for watersheds with different climate conditions another important reason for selecting krb is that swat is already established and well proven applicable in this basin tan et al 2018b tan et al 2017c the swat rainfall framework could be readily applied in different types of river basins once it is established and proven applicable in krb krb covers an area of approximately 12 685 km2 with the main river length of 248 km the basin elevation ranges from 2174 a m s l in the western and south western regions to 2 a m s l in the middle and northern regions tan et al 2017c major land use and land cover types of the basin are forest oil palm and rubber plantations krb receives a high annual precipitation ranging from 2000 mm year to 3200 mm year for the period of 1985 to 2014 tan et al 2017b heavy precipitation is normally found during the early northeast monsoon nem period in november and december up to 400 mm month whereas lower amount of monthly precipitation in krb is normally recorded in february to april 2 2 data for a comprehensive assessment we only considered the rainfall stations with less than 1 of missing values daily rainfall at nine climate stations from 1978 to 1999 were collected from the malaysian meteorological department fig 1 and table 1 most of the gauges have less than 0 1 missing values except for the pejabat haiwan jajahan machang station with the highest missing values of 0 54 we still included the station because it contains long term daily maximum and minimum temperature data that needed for swat model development missing values were then filled with the rainfall data of the nearest station the effect of missing values filling is negligible as most of the stations have no missing values a 90 m digital elevation model dem of shuttle radar topography mission srtm was used for river formation basin and sub basins delineation in swat modelling as proven by tan et al 2018a application of srtm dem could yield a better swat simulation in krb compared to other dem products such as the advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster dem river network in spatial format was collected from the department of irrigation and drainage did malaysia to integrate with the dem data for better river network formation monthly streamflow at jambatan guillermard from 1980 to 1999 was collected from the same department for swat calibration and validation land use and soil maps were collected from ministry of agriculture and agro based industries moa malaysia 3 methodology 3 1 swat model swat is a basin scale physically based and semi distributed hydrological model that operates on continuous time scale at sub daily and daily time steps arnold et al 1998 the model was designed to simulate the effects of different soil land use and agricultural management practices within basins by the u s department of agricultural and the texas a m university within swat a basin is divided into numerous sub basins which are then further divided into hydrological response unit hrus in this study the soil conservation service scs hargreaves and kinematic storage approaches were selected to estimate surface runoff evapotranspiration and channel routing respectively a detailed explanation of swat can be found in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 to capture the orographic precipitation swat applies up to 10 elevations bands in each sub basin as shown in fig 1 the orographic effect is mainly found in the west and southwestern regions of the basin a weather generator is plugged in the swat model to fill the missing values in rainfall data it uses a first order markov chain model to differentiate wet and dry day through a comparison between the model generated random numbers and user defined monthly wet dry probabilities neitsch et al 2011 rainfall amount of missing wet days are then generated by either the skewed distribution or modified exponential distribution the latter distribution is commonly used in limited data condition as it requires fewer inputs the skewed distribution eqs 2 and 3 and modified exponential distribution eq 4 equations are available as follows 2 r day μ mon 2 σ mon sn d day g mon 6 g mon 6 1 3 1 g mon 3 sn d day cos 6 283 r n d 2 2 ln rn d 1 4 r day μ mon ln r n d 1 r exp where μ mon and σ mon are the average and standard deviation of daily precipitation for the month respectively sn d day is the standard normal deviation for the specific day g mon is the skew coefficient of daily precipitation for the month rn d 1 and rn d 2 are random number from 0 to 1 r exp is an exponent value between 1 and 2 higher r exp value indicates more extreme rainfall events in the year 3 2 rainfall scarcity scenarios in the study one baseline s1 and 57 scenarios considering both the spatial s2 to s31 and temporal s32 to s58 rainfall scarcity were created and could be found in table 2 baseline is a combination of daily rainfall data from all the nine rain gauges and daily maximum and minimum temperature data from the pejabat haiwan jajahan machang station the s2 to s8 scenarios considered the reduced number of rainfall gauges starting with the station located farthest from the streamflow gauge while the s9 to s15 scenarios firstly removed the station nearest to the streamflow gauge the s2 to s15 scenarios were used to study how the rain gauge distance and number affect the swat outputs the s16 to s24 scenarios were designed to study whether single rain gauge is sufficient for swat modelling whereas spatial scarcity in rainfall gauge distribution or location effect situation was evaluated using the s2 s9 and s25 to s31 scenarios for example removal of the pos lebir station located in the southeast region of the basin as represented with the s28 scenario could help understand the effect of limiting rain gauges to the western region chen et al 2018b designed two types of temporal data scarcity situations for their evaluation 1 increasing missing rainfall values between 10 and 60 and 2 removing high low and normal flow events of specific years we further improved the temporal rainfall data scarcity scenarios by randomly selecting the missing values from 10 to 50 for calibration validation and entire periods separately s32 to s46 this can be used to study how missing values of different time slices could influence the swat modelling besides that a new missing values selection scheme was designed by classifying streamflow into 12 different categories daily rainfall data for each category of streamflow events were removed s47 to s58 to see how missing rainfall data for different flow intensities could affect swat simulations fig 2 shows the artificial missing values of temporal scarcity scenarios s32 to s58 designed for this study which were applied to all the rainfall stations the overall swat rainfall framework is shown in fig 3 3 3 swat setup with an area threshold of 200 km2 krb was divided into 39 sub basins and 203 hrus swat has been successfully applied in krb for various applications such as climate change tan et al 2017c spps reliability validation tan et al 2017a 2018b and dem input uncertainty tan et al 2018a groundwater revap coefficient gw revap baseflow alpha factor alpha bf and channel effective hydraulic conductivity ch k2 are found to be the most sensitive parameters in krb tan et al 2018b swat is capable to simulate daily streamflow accurately with the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 84 and 0 74 for calibration and validation respectively detailed description of the parameters sensitivity analysis calibration and validation can be found in these studies the well defined appropriate parameters ranges were directly applied for calibration 1980 to 1989 and validation 1990 to 1999 purposes in the baseline s1 with the first two years 1978 to 1999 as the warm up period we still run the swat calibration using the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 approach because the rain gauge network was different from previous studies the parameters ranges and finally fitted values generated can be found in table 2 there is no further discussion on the swat parameters sensitivity analysis as this study is only concentrated on sensitivity analysis of rain gauge data moreover other swat inputs i e land use soil and dem and simulation setting i e swat parameters drainage area threshold and hydrological components calculation approach were unchanged to minimize the disruption of other sources of uncertainty tan et al 2018a xu et al 2016 the performance of swat simulated under the 58 different rainfall scarcity scenarios table 2 were evaluated using nse and coefficient of determination r2 nse and r2 are the most commonly used statistical metrics to judge the success of swat simulation described in detail with evaluation guidelines by moriasi et al 2007 many swat reviews extracted nse and r2 values to summarize the overall performance of swat from their selected publications bressiani et al 2015 gassman et al 2014 tan et al 2019a in general nse defines how well the plot between observed and simulated data fits 1 1 line while r2 determines the degree of collinearity of observed and simulated data based on moriasi et al 2015 monthly swat simulated streamflow can be judged as satisfactory if 0 60 r2 0 75 and 0 50 nse 0 70 good if 0 75 r2 0 85 and 0 70 nse 0 80 and very good if r2 0 85 and nse 0 80 measurement of nse and r2 values between monthly observed and simulated flows was conducted for calibration 1980 to 1989 validation 1990 to 1999 and entire period 1980 to 1999 for a comprehensive assessment apart from the common performance assessment we also tried to understand how the rainfall data scarcity could influence the streamflow trend and magnitude analysis it is frequently applied in long hydro climatic series assessment and is important for water resources management a special caution needs to be taken if a significant increasing or decreasing trend is identified to the best of authors knowledge the streamflow trend and magnitude analysis is yet to be considered in any swat based rainfall scarcity studies mann kendall trend test is the most famous approach to detect changes of any hydro climatic time series the null hypothesis for mann kendall trend test is that there is no trend while the alternative hypothesis indicates there is either an increasing or decreasing trend for serially correlated data a modified mann kendall test using hamed and rao 1998 variance correction approach was used sen s slope test is widely used to capture the magnitude of streamflow in simpler words sen s slope tells on average how much streamflow has changed every year mann kendall and sen s slope values for the 58 scenarios table 2 were calculated using a r package called modified versions of mann kendall and spearman s rho trend tests modifiedmk more details on calculation of mann kendall and sen s slope are available in previous studies hamed and rao 1998 tan et al 2017b gocic and trajkovic 2013 4 results 4 1 effect of rain gauge data density the nse and r2 values for streamflow simulations under the 58 rainfall scarcity scenarios for the periods of calibration 1980 1989 validation 1990 1999 and overall 1980 1999 were listed in table 3 fig 4 shows the comparison between observed and simulated monthly streamflow for the krb from 1980 to 1999 the baseline scenario simulation had a good performance nse 0 78 and r2 0 81 in the calibration period and satisfactory performance in both the validation nse 0 60 and r2 0 78 and overall nse 0 60 and r2 0 78 periods this finding is consistent with tan et al 2017c and tan et al 2018b who reported satisfactory and good performance of swat modelling in the same basin rainfall station number has a significant impact on the swat modelling as for the s2 to s15 scenarios the nse and r2 values decreased from 0 71 to 0 49 and 0 76 to 0 42 respectively this shows that the performance of hydrological model reduced with the decreasing number of rainfall stations supporting conclusions of previous studies xue et al 2018 xu et al 2013 in krb the minimum number of station required to achieve satisfactory swat performance is four s6 these stations are not necessarily distributed evenly across the basin but at least one station should be close to the streamflow station poor performance could be clearly observed for the scenarios with less than three rainfall stations as shown in the statistical values of the s7 s8 and s14 to s24 scenarios negative values for nse during the calibration validation and entire periods for the s16 to s24 scenarios indicate that a single rainfall station simulation is insufficient for swat modelling on top of that fig 4 c shows the one gauge scenarios have significantly underestimated the high normal and low flows at the jambatan guillermard streamflow station therefore swat cannot be built with only one station even it is located closely to the streamflow station for example although the pejabat haiwan jajahan machang climate station s24 is just about 5 km from the streamflow station the sole use of its rainfall records still led to a poor simulation performance 4 2 effect of rain gauge data distribution distribution of the rainfall stations over krb can be divided into three major groups 1 lower basin the pejabat haiwan jajahan machang station that is nearest to the outlet and directly drains to the kelantan river 2 upper basin 1 seven stations located in the western and south western regions that mainly contribute to the galas river and 3 upper basin 2 the pos lebir station located around the lebir river in the south eastern part fig 1 removal of the post lebir station s25 caused a slight reduction of nse and r2 from 0 69 to 0 67 and 0 76 to 0 71 respectively in contrast removal of the pejabat haiwan jajahahan machang station has a larger impact on overall streamflow simulation with nse and r2 reduced to 0 57 and 0 61 respectively but the performance of the swat model is still under the satisfactory category as recommended by moriasi et al 2015 a comparison of the nse and r2 values between the s2 to s8 scenarios and the s9 to s15 scenarios was conducted to identify how station distance could influence the swat outputs basically the s2 to s8 scenarios performed better than the s9 to s15 scenarios showing station distance to the outlet used for calibration and validation had certainly influenced the modelling it can be seen that when the number of rainfall station is limited adding a station near the outlet will improve swat performance for instance the performance of swat under the s6 scenario removal of five farthest rainfall stations was better than the s13 scenario removal of five nearest rainfall stations as shown in table 3 this result may be due to the outlet s streamflow is largely contributed by surrounding rainfall surprisingly removal of four farthest closely located stations s5 in the upper south western part yielded a better modelling output because the swat performance was good for all the three calibration validation and overall periods assessment table 3 a possible explanation for this might be due to the uneven distribution of rainfall stations where most of them are concentrated on one side of the basin fig 1 this also accords with zeng et al 2018 which showed a large number of rainfall stations with uneven distribution were unable to support a good hydrological modelling 4 3 effect of missing rain gauge data as mentioned earlier in section 3 2 this study is among the limited studies evaluating how the missing values would impact the swat modelling the main novelty of this study is that we created the missing value scenarios with both random s32 to s46 and selective s47 to s58 schemes 10 to 50 of rainfall records were randomly selected and denoted as missing in the calibration s32 to s36 validation s37 to s41 and overall s42 to s46 periods respectively table 3 listed the statistics of the scenarios the results show that the occurrence of missing values in the calibration period 1980 1989 had only minor impact on streamflow simulation in the validation period 1990 1999 a similar situation was found for the impact of missing rainfall values in the validation period s37 to s41 however under the scenarios with missing values throughout the modelling period the simulated streamflow seems to become mismatched with the observed streamflow in addition results in table 3 have also indicated that more than 20 of missing values may significantly affect swat simulations results this outcome is somewhat different from chen et al 2018b which identified 60 as the critical threshold to cause poor swat performance in the daning river watershed of china this inconsistency may be due to the distinctly difference in climate and geographical i e land use and soil conditions between krb and daning river watershed krb has a higher rainfall variability than daning river watershed because of its tropical climate system average annual rainfall of krb 2500 mm year is much higher than the daning river watershed 1500 mm year moreover there are more rainfall days in the krb than the daning river watershed which would increase the uncertainty of the missing value filling scheme built in swat therefore missing values in rainfall records would have a higher impact on swat modelling in tropical region this study is one of the few examining how missing values of rainfall during high s47 s50 low s51 s54 and normal s55 s58 flows periods could affect the swat modelling interestingly a good swat performance was found for the scenarios with missing rainfall values in the high flow periods of more than 1500 m3 s table 3 meanwhile missing rainfall in the low and normal flow periods could lead to a more negative impact on swat simulated streamflow for example removal of missing rainfall values in the low flow periods of less than 500 m3 s resulted in the nse values of 30 22 28 87 and 29 56 for the calibration validation and overall periods respectively this result may be explained by the higher percentages of missing values in the low and moderate flows period compared to the high flow period as shown in fig 2 fig 4 f shows that missing rainfall values in the periods of different streamflow intensities would all lead to overestimation of streamflow probably due to the tendency of rainfall overestimation by the swat built in weather generator chen et al 2018b 5 discussion rainfall is one of the most important inputs to swat but also a major error source for inaccurate simulations tan et al 2017a ruan et al 2017 according to the results rainfall data scarcity had a considerable effect on swat simulation particularly missing rainfall value thus a special caution should be given on the rainfall data scarcity before building the swat model to improve the accuracy of swat modelling two criteria of rainfall station selection should be followed 1 low number of missing values if possible less than 10 and 2 include station located closely to the outlet another possible solution is application of satellite precipitation products spps to replace rainfall data with severe scarcity problem spps could be considered to avoid the rainfall data scarcity problem due to their huge coverage and continuous measurement capability application of spps in hydrological modelling is getting popular recently and their capability is well proven in many regions tan and santo 2018 wang et al 2017 zubieta et al 2017 for instance integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg spps under the global precipitation mission gpm covers the regions of 68os to 68on with a very high spatial resolution of 0 1 and temporal resolutions of 30 min are potential to substitute the traditional rainfall stations in swat modelling tan et al 2018b mohammed et al 2018 hou et al 2014 imerg spps could be used to study the flood pattern or forecasting as one of the imerg products is available near real time lack of high quality long term climate data to calculate the statistical parameters required in the weather generator of swat is a common issue around the world a direct application of the national centers for environmental prediction climate forecast system reanalysis ncep cfsr which are available at the swat website for the calculation might also lead to errors many studies have proved that the ncep cfsr rainfall data were unable to provide accurate swat modelling tan et al 2017a chen et al 2018a hence it is not suitable for calculating the statistical parameters essential to missing value filling in swat improvement of the missing value filing by the weather generator is in urgent need in future research to improve the quality of hydro climatic modelling besides that swat modeler may fill the missing rainfall values with more reliable approach before using them as swat inputs to reduce the uncertainty of the weather generator within swat however the missing value filling should only be conducted at rainfall stations whose missing values are under the critical threshold fig 5 shows the flow duration curve as simulated under various rainfall data scarcity scenarios as illustrated in fig 5 c limiting rainfall inputs to a single rainfall station led to a significant underestimation of both peak and low flows in krb this is probably because the rainfall interpolation scheme in swat is unable to interpolate a single rainfall station meanwhile missing rainfall value led to overestimating the peak and low flows in the krb as a result excessive missing rainfall values may cause much uncertainty in extreme flow simulations we further evaluated how the rainfall data scarcity could affect the results of trend and magnitude change analysis fig 6 in general changes in the number and distribution of stations have not shown a significant impact on streamflow trend and magnitude analysis by contrast missing rainfall values may lead to an opposite streamflow trend for example monthly streamflow as simulated under the s33 to s37 scenarios exhibited a decreasing trend with rates of 3 11 m3 s to 77 68 m3 s whereas the baseline scenario showed an increasing trend of 14 44 m3 s 6 conclusions streamflow simulation performance by swat was assessed under 58 different rainfall data scarcity scenarios in a tropical river basin the 58 scenarios were carefully designed to reflect the spatial station number and location effect and temporal random and selective missing values rainfall scarcity patterns the main contribution of this study is that we consider the effect of distance between rainfall and streamflow stations which were seldom reported in previous studies moreover this is among the few studies examining the effect of missing rainfall values of different periods of modelling i e calibration and validation as well as streamflow intensities low moderate and high flows on swat modelling more evaluation indicators such as flow duration curve trend and magnitude change analysis were added in the swat rainfall framework for a more comprehensive analysis the number of rainfall stations has a considerable impact on swat streamflow simulation as its performance reduced with the decreasing number of rainfall station the minimum number of rainfall stations to achieve a satisfactory swat performance in krb is four while at least one station should be located close to the streamflow station the study found that the use of a single rainfall station would lead to erroneous swat simulations of all the high normal and low flows for trend and magnitude analysis both the number and distribution of rainfall stations had less impact on the swat streamflow simulations than the degree of rainfall missing value the most obvious finding to emerge from this study is that occurrences of missing values in the calibration period 1980 1989 had only a little impact on streamflow simulation in the validation period 1990 1999 with the condition that swat has already been well calibrated in previous studies however missing value in either calibration nor validation periods would significantly reduce the overall period 1980 1999 performance besides that the newly determined missing rainfall value threshold of 20 required for satisfactory streamflow modelling in tropical region should help modelers in their efforts of optimizing rainfall data collection and preparation to increase swat modelling effectiveness besides that excessive missing rainfall value would lead to the overestimation of extreme flows and detection of false trend in the krb therefore a special caution should be exerted on controlling missing rainfall values to improve swat modelling a further study could assess the capability of spps in swat modelling to avoid the rainfall scarcity issue particularly in ungauged basins tan et al 2018b yuan et al 2017 merging of rainfall data from spps and rain gauges could solve the problems of insufficient rainfall stations and missing values further research should also focus on improvement of the weather generator within the swat model by considering lack of reliable long term climate data for the climate parameters calculation another future research need is

5629,improving model performance in ungauged basins has been a chronic challenge in watershed model application to understand and assess water quality impacts of agricultural conservation practices land use change and climate adaptation measures in large river basins here we evaluate a modified version of swat2012 referred to as swat ec hereafter which integrates an energy balanced soil temperature module stm and the centruy based soil organic matter algorithm for simulating water quality parameters in the upper mississippi river basin umrb and compare it against the original swat2012 model evaluation was performed for simulating streamflow sediment and nitrate n no3 n and total nitrogen tn loadings at three stations near the outlets of umrb the model comparison was conducted without parameter calibration in order to assess their performance under ungauged conditions the results indicate that swat ec outperformed swat2012 for stream flow and no3 n and tn loading simulation on both monthly and annual scales for sediment swat ec performed better than swat2012 on a monthly time step basis but no noticeable improvement was found at the annual scale in addition the performance of the uncalibrated swat ec was comparable to other calibrated swat models reported in previous publications with respect to sediment and no3 n loadings these findings highlight the importance of advancing process representation in physically based models to improve model credibility particularly in ungauged basins keywords stream flow sediment nitrate total nitrogen watershed 1 introduction the design and evaluation of land and water management practices depend on the total hydrologic and biogeochemical performance within a watershed parmele 1972 watershed scale models are widely used approaches to predict water quantity and quality accounting for complex physical chemical and biological processes of a watershed clark et al 2015 the application of large scale watershed models requires many spatially variable input data including weather topographic and soil characteristics and land use and management data which are difficult to obtain srinivasan et al 2010 even with enough datasets it will take great effort to incorporate the information into model configuration gassman et al 2006 more importantly since many physical and biogeochemical processes are conceptually simplified in watershed models many parameters governing model behavior are not physically based and need to be calibrated before assessing alternative scenarios and supporting decision making beven and binley 1992 successful model calibration requires long and high quality observations of water quantity and quality variables which are always limited on both spatial and temporal scales especially in ungauged watersheds sivapalan 2003 using limited observations for model calibration may cause biased estimation of calibrated parameters boyle et al 2000 doherty and johnston 2003 in addition as physically based watershed models often contain dozens or even hundreds of parameters to be calibrated the information contained in observations of streamflow and water quality measurements at the outlet of a watershed is usually not adequate for reliably determining true values of those parameters beven and smith 2014 since the initiative of the iahs decade on predictions in ungauged basins pub sivapalan 2003 different approaches have been developed and used to enhance watershed model reliability for example improvements in model performance has been achieved by transferring parameter information from adjacent gauged watersheds to the ungauged watershed burn and boorman 1993 qi et al 2018a or improving input data quality using remote sensing and geographic information system gis techniques fortin et al 2001 sun et al 2010 recent studies show that a valid approach to improve model reliability is to enhance model structure and account for well understood hydrological and biogeochemical processes instead of using simplified processes butts et al 2004 fenicia et al 2008 perrin et al 2001 pomeroy et al 2007 the soil and water assessment tool swat model was originally developed to operate in large scale ungauged watersheds with minimal calibration efforts arnold et al 1998 it attempts to incorporate spatially and physically distributed watershed inputs to simulate surface and subsurface flow sediment generation and deposit and nutrient movement and fate through the watershed system gassman et al 2007 as a continuous and semi distributed watershed scale model swat has been successfully used to simulate water quantity and quality in a wide range of gauged or ungauged watersheds across the world abbaspour et al 2017 gitau and chaubey 2010 lee et al 2017 lee et al 2016 li et al 2014 ndomba et al 2005 qi et al 2017a qi et al 2017b srinivasan et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2020 despite its wide use swat encountered difficulties in regions with climate soil and topography characteristics that go beyond the conditions the algorithms in the model have been calibrated for chu and shirmohammadi 2004 hülsmann et al 2015 mittelstet et al 2017 qi et al 2019a qi et al 2019c wagner et al 2011 one reason explaining the difficulty is that many hydrological and biogeochemical processes in swat are described using empirical equations which limited its application on specific conditions during the past decades various studies have developed new algorithms with respect to hydrology and sediment and nutrient cycles within swat to solve their own concerned environmental issues eckhardt et al 2002 kim and lee 2010 qi et al 2016b qi et al 2019b qi et al 2018b sakaguchi et al 2014 tuppad et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 among those swat modification studies many were focusing on developing more physically based modules to replace the original empirically based algorithms most studies were conducted on a site or small watershed scale to quantify the value of the improvements in physical process representation in swat note that those studies often calibrated model parameters during the comparison of different versions of swat however zhang et al 2013 showed that even when the structure of swat was not well configured parameter calibration against streamflow observed at the watershed outlet could attain parameter values that meet satisfactory model performance criteria as suggested by moriasi et al 2007 arnold et al 2015 also pointed out the importance of accurate representation of model processes and its impact on calibration and following scenario analysis these findings highlight the importance of improving process representation in addition to parameter calibration to ensure reliability of watershed model simulation the swat model was originally designed to simulate large scale ungauged watersheds arnold et al 1998 up to date only a few studies have evaluated swat performance under ungauged conditions e g srinivasan et al 2010 in this study we aimed to evaluate the value of advancing soil energy and biogeochemical processes in swat for simulating water quality in a large river basin i e the upper mississippi river basin umrb under ungauged conditions here we evaluated an enhanced version of swat2012 referred to as swat ec hereafter which has integrated an energy balanced soil temperature module stm and the centruy based soil organic matter algorithm and compared it against the original swat2012 to understand which algorithms contribute to the improvements in swat ec we also investigated performance of swat2012 with centruy referred to as swat c and swat2012 with the energy balanced soil temperature module referred to as swat e the four versions of swat models were not calibrated and were evaluated against monthly and annual streamflow sediment nitrate no3 n and total nitrogen tn loadings at three gauging stations near the outlet of umrb multiple widely used statistics were used to evaluate the performance difference between different versions of swat models to put the model performance in context we also compared the uncalibrated swat models developed in this study with previous studies that reported performance of swat with calibration we anticipate the results will help understand the value of advancing processes representation in swat for water quality modeling in large scale ungauged basins 2 data and model description 2 1 modifications made to swat2012 2 1 1 physically based soil temperature module in swat2012 soil temperature tsoil is calculated at the center of a soil layer z on the hydrologic response unit hru scale with the following equation neitsch 2011 1 t soil z γ t soil z 1 γ d t aair t sur t sur where γ is the lag coefficient controlling the influence of the previous day s temperature on the current day s temperature tsoil is the soil temperature from the previous day at depth z d is the depth factor that quantifies the influence of depth on soil temperature t aair is the average annual air temperature and tsur is the soil surface temperature on the day the depth factor is a function of depth at the center of the soil layer z maximum damping depth bulk density and soil water the soil surface temperature is a function of the previous day s temperature the amount of ground cover and the bare soil temperature the effects of snow and plant canopy cover on soil temperature are incorporated empirically as a weighting factor the bare soil temperature is a function of daily average minimum and maximum temperature as well as solar radiation reaching the ground and albedo a physically based and energy balanced stm has been developed and implemented based on heat transfer theory qi et al 2016b 2 t t x k c t x s c where t is the temperature c t represents the time step in days k is the thermal conductivity j cm 1 d 1 c 1 c is the volumetric heat capacity j cm 3 c 1 x is the vertical distance from the air soil or air snow interface cm and s is the latent heat source sink term j cm 3 d 1 the eq 2 is converted to a fully implicit discretized form and was solved with the tridiagonal matrix algorithm described in patankar 1980 the simulation domain was defined as extending from the air soil or air snow interface upper boundary to the damping depth lower boundary where the impact of air temperature diminishes the temperature was calculated at the center of each soil layer for individual hru when snow accumulated on the ground the snow cover was treated as a single layer heat capacity and thermal conductivity were assumed to be uniform within individual layers stm can address the intermediary role of snow cover in the daily evolution of the soil temperature profile which is important for the application of swat in cold climate regions of the world instead of considering soil temperature as a function of air temperature by the empirical soil temperature module within swat stm simulates temperature change in snow and soils as a result of heat conduction and latent heat exchange the new module can estimate snow or soil surface temperature based on energy balance update thermal properties of snow and soils according to changes in snow density and soil moisture and simulate freeze thaw cycles in the soil profile stm has tested with field observed temperatures from a small experimental watershed in atlantic canada qi et al 2016b demonstrating a great improvement in prediction of soil temperatures 2 1 2 century based soil organic matter algorithms in swat2012 and previous versions a papran model seligman and keulen 1980 has been used to simulate organic nitrogen cycling the papran model considers organic n in plant residue and active and stable humus pools the decomposition of each pool is influenced by water temperature c n ratio and intrinsic properties of substrate neitsch et al 2011 one of the drawbacks of the papran model that it does not explicitly simulate carbon cycling in soil which is closely coupled with nitrogen cycling on the other hand the century model parton et al 1994 considers both c and n cycling and represents soil organic matter som and residue in five pools plant litter is split into a metabolic carbon pool e g proteins and sugars and a recalcitrant structural carbon pool e g lignin and cell walls century also has an amicrobial biomass pool soil humus includes two pools slow humus pool receives c and n from the decomposition of structural litter metabolic litter and microbial biomass and often has a turnover time of 20 50 years while passive humus pool includes physically and chemically stabilized som absorbed to clays and may take hundreds to thousands of years to decompose the decomposition of each pool is determined by multiple factors such as water temperature tillage c n ratio oxygen availability soil texture and substrate specific properties the major difference between papran and century lies in how detailed they represent som residue how the decomposition rates are calculated and the coupling between c and n cycling in general century incorporates more detailed biochemical properties and environmental factors in describing the processes relevant to som residue dynamics zhang et al 2013 yang et al 2017 and yang and zhang 2016 successfully tested the century algorithm for simulating c and n progress using 16 ameriflux agricultural sites http public ornl gov ameriflux in the us midwest and three long term ecological research lter sites at the kellogg biological station kbs https lter kbs msu edu in southern michigan however the century algorithm in swat has not been tested for benefiting nutrients cycling modeling in large ungauged basins 2 2 study area the umrb drains an area of 431 000 km2 from northern minnesota to its confluence with the ohio river at the southern tip of illinois fig 1 srinivasan et al 2010 the states of illinois iowa minnesota missouri and

precipitation ranges from 575 mm in the western part of minnesota to 981 mm in the central part of illinois and the average monthly maximum temperature ranging from 9 8 c in january in central minnesota to 31 7 c in july in central missouri wu and tanaka 2005 soil type in the basin ranges from heavy poorly drained clay soil to light well drained sands 2 3 swat model setup the swat model requires a variety of detailed information describing the land use soil and topography data of the umrb the present study adopted the input data from srinivasan et al 2010 and compared the performance of different swat models the umrb was divided into 131 subbasins according to the eight digit united states geological survey usgs hydrologic unit codes hucs fig 1 national hydrography dataset nhd stream dataset and a 90 m digital elevation model dem was used to provide watershed configuration and topographic parameter estimation a land use map was created by combining two sources of information i e the cropland data layer cdl and 2001 national land cover data to better define cultivated and non agricultural land use the state soil geographic statsgo database 1 250 000 scale soil map was used for umrb using a threshold operation of 5 for land use 10 for soil and 5 for slope 14 568 hrus were generated and the number of hrus per subbasin ranged from 58 to 216 management practices such as tile drainage tillage crop rotation and fertilizer application were included in the project according to various sources to save space here we only provide brief description of the input data and detailed model setup information can be found in srinivasan et al 2010 the fertilization rates followed the state values reported by unite states department of agriculture economic research service 1 1 https www ers usda gov data products fertilizer use and price aspx for tile drainage we used statsgo soil databased to identify those locations that are poorly drained with a slope less than 1 and under agricultural land use tillage intensity information at the county scale is obtained from the conservation technology information center ctic 2 2 www ctic purdue edu we represented conservation reduced tillage and full tillage according to slope deepness sorted agricultural hrus in ascending order according to slope and try to assign full tillage to low slope hrus and reduced tillage and conservation tillage for hrus with deep slopes 2 4 weather data the swat model requires daily values of precipitation max min air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed as forcing data here we used daily precipitation max min air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed derived from phase 2 of the north american land data assimilation system nldas2 3 3 ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas climate forcing data has assimilated multiple sources of climate observations and is widely recognized as a high resolution 1 8 spatially continuous and comprehensive dataset that is valuable for water cycling studies xia et al 2012 the data ranges from 01 to 01 1979 to present the spatial domain spatial resolution computational grid terrain height and land mask of nldas2 are identical to that in nldas1 which is described in mitchell et al 2004 we aggregated the gridded daily values of nldas2 data to the eight digit subbasins using standard arcgis aggregation procedures as a result 131 weather datasets one for each subbasin were created to input into the swat model 2 5 streamflow and water quality data streamflow data were obtained from us geological survey usgs for the period of 1981 1997 monthly sediment nitrate and organic nitrogen flux data were obtained from the usgs upper midwest environmental science center umesc for the period of 1981 1997 fig 1 shows the usgs gauging station locations that provided observed data used in comparisons table 1 shows the drainage area indicated by usgs and swat and the time period during which observed data were available because the usgs gauge location may not always correspond to the outlet of the hucs there will be some difference between the two areas in addition table 1 provides the time period of data available for comparison 2 6 model evaluation in this study we evaluated four versions of swat i e swat ec swat c swat e and swat2012 fig 2 swat ec has integrated the energy balanced soil temperature module stm and the centruy based soil organic matter algorithm swat c only integrated the centruy based soil organic matter algorithm swat e only integrated the energy balanced soil temperature module fig 2 the four versions of swat models were not calibrated and were evaluated against monthly and annual streamflow sediment nitrate no3 n and total nitrogen tn loadings at three gauging stations near the outlet of umrb model performance was assessed using three coefficients of accuracy i e percent bias pbias coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 the equations used to calculate the above three statistics are given as 3 p bias 100 o avg p avg o avg 4 ns 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o avg

predicted values table 1 shows the basic characteristics of the usgs stations used for model performance evaluation 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of four versions of swat model with respect to different water quantity and quality variables model performance evaluation results on stream flow and sediment no3 n and tn loadings at three usgs gauging stations at monthly and annual scales are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively the evaluation periods for usgs gauging stations corresponding to the outlets of subbasin 63 and 100 is from 1980 to 1987 and from 1980 to 1988 respectively while for the station at the outlet of subbasin 95 is from 1991 to 1997 in the table shaded numbers indicate the three versions of enhanced swat model i e swat c swat e and swat ec performed less than swat2012 average annual basin values for major hydrology and nitrogen cycle components from 1980 to 1997 simulated by four versions of swat model are shown in table 4 3 1 1 streamflow for monthly streamflow simulation all three enhanced swat i e swat c swat e and swat ec outperformed swat2012 table 2 swat c performed modestly better than swat2012 in terms of all three statistics and at all three stations that is swat c both explained more monthly variation and reduced overall bias compared with swat2012 swat e achieved much better simulation of monthly streamflow but slightly increased pbias by 1 for all three stations comparison between swat c and swat e indicates that swat c performed better in terms of reducing overall bias while swat e was better regarding capturing variability of monthly streamflow swat ec seems to benefit from the advantage of both swat c and swat c and pronouncedly outperformed swat2012 in terms of explaining variations in monthly streamflow and reducing overall bias on the annual scale model performance for the four versions of swat model in general followed the pattern observed except that swat e slightly performed less than swat2012 in terms of ns at the outlets of subbasin 95 and 100 table 3 by analyzing the average annual values of key hydrologic budget components table 4 we found that swat c simulated lower average annual et and higher average annual surface runoff lateral flow and baseflow than swat2012 even though water flow through different pathways were increased by swat c average annual no3 n loadings transported with those water flows became less than those of swat2012 table 4 mainly because the century method generated less nitrate in soils compared with papran swat e pronouncedly improved streamflow simulation compared with swat2012 because with stm swat e tended to generate more infiltration and less surface runoff during winter and the snowmelt season on the watershed scale qi et al 2016a this is also can be seen from table 4 where average annual surface runoff 85 mm generated with swat e was less than that 113 mm of swat2012 and average annual lateral flow and baseflow 39 and 109 mm respectively generated with swat e were greater than those 30 and 92 mm respectively of swat2012 the new stm more realistically accounted for snowpack insulation effects on soil temperature allowing surface soil layers to remain unfrozen when snow accumulating on the ground as a result swat e improved its simulation on hydrological effects of unfrozen soil during winter and the snowmelt seasons 3 1 2 sediment like streamflow simulation all three enhanced versions of swat model attained higher r2 and ns values than the corresponding values of swat2012 at all three stations notably swat ec achieved the highest r2 and ns values among all four models at all three stations except for r2 at the outlet of subbasin 63 which is slightly less than the r2 of swat e table 2 swat e outperformed swat c with respect to r2 and ns values compared with swat2012 swat c reduced pbais values generated more sediment loadings while swat e increased pbias values generated less sediment loadings which is the major factor explaining the reduced pbias values of swat ec that fall somewhere between those by swat c and swat e table 2 the reason for reduced pbias by swat c is that swat c generated more stream flow as explained in the previous section and table 4 while swat e generated less stream flow and caused increases in pbias on the annual scale model performance for the four versions of swat model generally follows the pattern observed on the monthly scale except that swat ec performed less than swat2012 at two stations in terms of r2 and or ns table 3 although we did not directly modify algorithms of erosion from uplands and sediment deposition and resuspension processes in streams due to the fact that surface runoff and stream flow are closely correlated with sediment generation and transport especially at the monthly scale improved simulation of surface runoff and stream flow led to improved simulation of monthly variability of sediment loading as indicated by the comparison results 3 1 3 nitrate different from model performance comparison results for stream flow and sediment loading no clear pattern was identified for no3 n loading that is model performance evaluation results are in general mixed swat c had greater r2 at the outlet of subbasin 95 and greater ns at the outlets of subbasin 63 and 100 than swat2012 table 2 although swat e attained greater r2 for all three stations than swat2012 it only had one station with a greater ns than swat2012 table 2 the absolute values of pbias of swat c and swat e were all larger than those of swat2012 except that swat e had lower bias at the outlet of subbasin 63 table 2 with examination of the pbias values of different versions of swat model we found that as compared with swat2012 swat c distinctly increased pbias less nitrate loadings while swat e reduced pbias more nitrate loadings as swat ec merged both swat c and swat e its pbias values fall somewhere between those of swat c and swat e and as a result the absolute pbias values of swat ec were in general less than those of swat2012 the difference is negligible at the outlet of subbasin 100 i e 0 of swat2012 vs 2 of swat ec table 2 in addition swat ec outperformed swat2012 in terms of most of r2 and ns values at the three stations except for r2 value at the outlet of subbasin 100 table 2 the increased pbias values for swat c is partially explained by lower average annual no3 n loadings transported with different water flows compared with those of swat2012 table 4 since swat e simulated more infiltration than swat2012 in areas with seasonal snow cover during winter and the snowmelt season more nitrate was leached and exported to streams as compared with swat2012 this is consistent with increased average annual no3 n loadings transported with lateral flow and baseflow and decreased average annual no3 n loadings transported with surface runoff compared with those of swat2012 table 4 overall these changes in swat e caused the reduction in pbias values at the watershed scale as compared with swat2012 qi et al 2016a in general swat ec balances the strength and weakness of swat c and swat e and achieved an overall better model performance on no3 n loading than swat2012 on the monthly scale table 2 on the annual scale model performance results are like the monthly scale findings table 3 3 1 4 total nitrogen the four models exhibited similar performance for simulating no3 n and tn mainly because no3 n accounts for a major portion of tn like the model comparison for nitrate simulation no single model outperformed the others at all stations and for all evaluation statistics for instance swat c had lower values of r2 but higher ns values than swat2012 at all three stations table 2 swat e attained higher values of r2 but lower ns values than swat2012 at three stations table 2 in general swat2012 and swat e tended to overestimate tn while swat c exhibited underestimation table 2 swat ec better captured seasonal variability of tn and achieved lower bias than swat2012 at all three stations except for higher bias at the outlet of subbasin 63 table 2 the annual results table 3 also confirmed the advantage of integrating advanced biogeochemical and energy balanced algorithms for achieving improved simulation of nitrogen loading in large scale ungauged basins 3 2 monthly examination of the results by swat2012 and swat ec the observed and simulated monthly stream flow and sediment no3 n and tn loadings by swat2012 and swat ec at the three stations respectively shown in figs 3 4 and 5 the swat ec model was found to have slightly damped snowmelt flow peaks compared with swat2012 leading to improved model performance as indicated in tables 2 and 3 as stated in section 3 1 1 swat ec tends to generate more infiltration and less surface runoff during winter and snowmelt seasons because the stm accounts for snow insulation effects on soil temperature leading to surface soil layers remaining unfrozen when snow cover presents both versions of swat model tended to underestimate sediment loading peaks during the spring snowmelt season especially at the outlets of subbasin 63 and 100 fig 3b and 5b which explained the relatively large pbias shown in tables 2 and 3 compared with swat2012 swat ec obtained less sediment loading peaks because it generated less surface runoff fig 3b 4b and 5b furthermore swat2012 tended to generate sediment loading peaks ahead of observed peaks about one month earlier while swat ec simulated sediment loading peaks matched well the timing of observation note that the sediment loading peaks generated by swat ec were less than those generated by the swat2012 fig 3b 4b and 5b mainly due to lower surface runoff both versions of swat model tended to underestimate no3 n loading peaks during snowmelt season at the outlets of subbasin 63 from 1980 to 1987 and overestimate them at the outlet of subbasin 95 from 1991 to 1997 fig 3c and 4c such a shift in model performance over time may be caused by the lack of detailed fertilization data over years and at fine scales that are required for accurate nutrient loss simulation compared with swat2012 swat ec generated much more no3 n loadings at the outlet of subbasin 63 and less no3 n loadings at the outlet of subbasin 95 during snowmelt season which is a major reason explaining the improvement in model performance for no3 n loading both models performed well at the outlet of subbasin 100 with swat ec performed slightly better fig 5c and table 2 in addition swat2012 tended to overestimate tn loading peaks during snowmelt period at all three stations while tn loading peaks simulated by swat ec were more consistent with observations fig 3c 4c and 5c which explained the improvement in model performance of tn loading as shown in tables 2 and 3 the overall improvement of swat ec over swat2012 for simulating no3 n and tn is the result of combining the strengths from swat c and swat e as shown in table 2 swat e contributed more to the improvements in swat ec with respect to explaining variability of hydrology and sediment yield while contribution from swat c modestly improved bias in streamflow and sediment yield simulation as to nitrate and tn neither swat c nor swat e clearly outperformed swat2012 for example swat e performed less than swat2012 in terms of both ns and pbias in simulating tn for all stations while swat c had larger bias at all stations from simulation of nitrate these results demonstrate the complexity and combined efforts of energy and biogeochemical processes on hydrology and water quality and highlight the importance of advancing the coupled water energy biogeochemistry processes within swat toward better watershed modeling and assessment based on ns and pbias values generated by swat ec model performance was satisfactory for stream flow ns 0 5 and pbais 25 at all three gauging stations on the monthly scale swat ec performances on sediment loading were also satisfactory ns 0 5 and pbias 55 at these stations statistic values were all falling into satisfactory category for no3 n and total n simulation on the monthly scale moriasi et al 2007 except for ns for subbasin 95 0 02 for no3 n and 0 18 for tn these results demonstrate the potential of advancing process representation in swat to achieve satisfactory simulation of water quality in large scale ungauged basins 3 3 assessment of a simple multi model approach multi model approaches often help reduce uncertainty in hydrological predictions and improve model predictability because a combination of predictions from many single models could synergize the strength of these single models li and sankarasubramanian 2012 multi model predictions are usually obtained by taking a weighted average of the predictions from the single models the weights sum up to one the weights can be derived from several multi model combination methods including weighted average of single model predictions or using statistical techniques e g multiple linear regression and bayesian model averaging duan et al 2007 krishnamurti et al 1999 marshall et al 2006 oudin et al 2006 shamseldin et al 1997 in this study we used the simple equal weighted method to assess model performance on monthly water quality and quantity prediction specifically an ensemble simulation was generated by taking the average of the four simulations by the four versions of swat i e swat2012 swat e swat c and swat ec for streamflow sediment no3 n and total n correspondingly three statistics i e r2 ns and pbias were calculated for the new ensemble simulation table 5 in comparison with the statistical values shown table 3 the ensemble simulation generally performed better than then poorest single model but less than the best single model this result indicates that a simple average of the four swat models may not yield better performance however more advanced methods e g multiple linear regression or bayesian model averaging deserve research to combine different model structures to achieve more accurate hydrologic and water quality modeling in the future 3 4 comparison with previous studies multiple studies have been conducted to simulate water quantity and quality in the umrb using calibrated versions of swat arnold et al 2000 jha et al 2006 jha et al 2004 jha et al 2015 wu et al 2012 as for water quality variables only sediment and no3 n loading simulation results were reported in two studies jha et al 2006 jha et al 2015 we summarized the model performance evaluated based on r2 and ns from those studies to put the performance of the four versions of swat examined in context the statistics values reported in previous studies are shown in table 6 as those previous studies only reported results at the gauging station at the outlet of umrb i e usgs gauge 05587450 the comparison between our results and previous studies was only conducted at this site for sediment loading simulation compared with jha et al s 2006 results in their calibration period r2 0 66 and ns 0 66 swat2012 had lower r2 and ns values r2 0 57 and ns 0 48 while swat ec achieved higher r2 0 77 and comparable ns 0 62 on the monthly scale on the annual scale both swat2012 and swat ec attained greater r2 0 83 and 0 85 respectively and less ns 0 44 and 0 47 respectively values than those r2 0 77 and ns 0 69 of jha et al 2006 for their calibration period considering the different periods of dataset used in model evaluation 1980 1988 for present study vs 1981 1992 for jha et al 2006 it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion however it is fair to conclude that our sediment simulation evaluation is comparable to those reported previous since no previous study reported swat performance on monthly no3 n loading we only compared our annual results to those reported by jha et al 2015 both swat2012 and swat ec models attained higher r2 0 82 and 0 84 respectively and ns 0 68 and 0 83 respectively values than those r2 0 62 and ns 0 46 of jha et al 2015 reported for the period of 1981 2003 again due to the difference in the periods of data used in this study 1981 1988 and by jha et al 2015 1981 2003 we could not conclude that the two uncalibrated versions of swat performed better but the comparison between the statistics shows the promise of using the latest released swat model and the enhanced swat with respect to energy and biogeochemistry to achieve satisfactory simulation of nitrate loading in ungauged basin 4 conclusions in the present study we evaluated swat2012 and three enhanced versions i e swat c swat e and swat ec which integrates a centruy based soil organic matter module an energy balanced soil temperature module stm and both century and stm respectively for simulating water quality variables in the upper mississippi river basin umrb under ungauged conditions we found that both swat c and swat e improved hydrology and sediment simulations as compared with swat2012 where swat c helped reduce overall bias and swat e better captured seasonality particularly during winter and snowmelt seasons swat ec combined the strengths of both swat c and swat e leading to much improved explanation of monthly variation and comparable biases as compared with swat2012 as to nitrate no3 n and total nitrogen tn neither swat c nor swat e clearly outperformed swat2012 which demonstrate the complexity and combined efforts of energy and biogeochemical processes on hydrology and water quality in general swat c performance is similar to that of swat2012 while swat e improved simulation of spring fluxes of no3 n and tn again swat ec benefited from both swat c and swat e and for most cases achieved better results than swat2012 in terms of explaining observed data variability and reducing simulation biases based on the model evaluation criteria summarized in moriasi et al 2007 the performance of the uncalibrated swat ec model was categorized as satisfactory and was comparable to calibrated swat models reported in previous studies overall our results demonstrate the value of advancing process representation in physically based watershed models to improve model credibility particularly in ungauged basins we anticipate that the new model development efforts will benefit future watershed modeling and assessment efforts in

5629,improving model performance in ungauged basins has been a chronic challenge in watershed model application to understand and assess water quality impacts of agricultural conservation practices land use change and climate adaptation measures in large river basins here we evaluate a modified version of swat2012 referred to as swat ec hereafter which integrates an energy balanced soil temperature module stm and the centruy based soil organic matter algorithm for simulating water quality parameters in the upper mississippi river basin umrb and compare it against the original swat2012 model evaluation was performed for simulating streamflow sediment and nitrate n no3 n and total nitrogen tn loadings at three stations near the outlets of umrb the model comparison was conducted without parameter calibration in order to assess their performance under ungauged conditions the results indicate that swat ec outperformed swat2012 for stream flow and no3 n and tn loading simulation on both monthly and annual scales for sediment swat ec performed better than swat2012 on a monthly time step basis but no noticeable improvement was found at the annual scale in addition the performance of the uncalibrated swat ec was comparable to other calibrated swat models reported in previous publications with respect to sediment and no3 n loadings these findings highlight the importance of advancing process representation in physically based models to improve model credibility particularly in ungauged basins keywords stream flow sediment nitrate total nitrogen watershed 1 introduction the design and evaluation of land and water management practices depend on the total hydrologic and biogeochemical performance within a watershed parmele 1972 watershed scale models are widely used approaches to predict water quantity and quality accounting for complex physical chemical and biological processes of a watershed clark et al 2015 the application of large scale watershed models requires many spatially variable input data including weather topographic and soil characteristics and land use and management data which are difficult to obtain srinivasan et al 2010 even with enough datasets it will take great effort to incorporate the information into model configuration gassman et al 2006 more importantly since many physical and biogeochemical processes are conceptually simplified in watershed models many parameters governing model behavior are not physically based and need to be calibrated before assessing alternative scenarios and supporting decision making beven and binley 1992 successful model calibration requires long and high quality observations of water quantity and quality variables which are always limited on both spatial and temporal scales especially in ungauged watersheds sivapalan 2003 using limited observations for model calibration may cause biased estimation of calibrated parameters boyle et al 2000 doherty and johnston 2003 in addition as physically based watershed models often contain dozens or even hundreds of parameters to be calibrated the information contained in observations of streamflow and water quality measurements at the outlet of a watershed is usually not adequate for reliably determining true values of those parameters beven and smith 2014 since the initiative of the iahs decade on predictions in ungauged basins pub sivapalan 2003 different approaches have been developed and used to enhance watershed model reliability for example improvements in model performance has been achieved by transferring parameter information from adjacent gauged watersheds to the ungauged watershed burn and boorman 1993 qi et al 2018a or improving input data quality using remote sensing and geographic information system gis techniques fortin et al 2001 sun et al 2010 recent studies show that a valid approach to improve model reliability is to enhance model structure and account for well understood hydrological and biogeochemical processes instead of using simplified processes butts et al 2004 fenicia et al 2008 perrin et al 2001 pomeroy et al 2007 the soil and water assessment tool swat model was originally developed to operate in large scale ungauged watersheds with minimal calibration efforts arnold et al 1998 it attempts to incorporate spatially and physically distributed watershed inputs to simulate surface and subsurface flow sediment generation and deposit and nutrient movement and fate through the watershed system gassman et al 2007 as a continuous and semi distributed watershed scale model swat has been successfully used to simulate water quantity and quality in a wide range of gauged or ungauged watersheds across the world abbaspour et al 2017 gitau and chaubey 2010 lee et al 2017 lee et al 2016 li et al 2014 ndomba et al 2005 qi et al 2017a qi et al 2017b srinivasan et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2020 despite its wide use swat encountered difficulties in regions with climate soil and topography characteristics that go beyond the conditions the algorithms in the model have been calibrated for chu and shirmohammadi 2004 hülsmann et al 2015 mittelstet et al 2017 qi et al 2019a qi et al 2019c wagner et al 2011 one reason explaining the difficulty is that many hydrological and biogeochemical processes in swat are described using empirical equations which limited its application on specific conditions during the past decades various studies have developed new algorithms with respect to hydrology and sediment and nutrient cycles within swat to solve their own concerned environmental issues eckhardt et al 2002 kim and lee 2010 qi et al 2016b qi et al 2019b qi et al 2018b sakaguchi et al 2014 tuppad et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 among those swat modification studies many were focusing on developing more physically based modules to replace the original empirically based algorithms most studies were conducted on a site or small watershed scale to quantify the value of the improvements in physical process representation in swat note that those studies often calibrated model parameters during the comparison of different versions of swat however zhang et al 2013 showed that even when the structure of swat was not well configured parameter calibration against streamflow observed at the watershed outlet could attain parameter values that meet satisfactory model performance criteria as suggested by moriasi et al 2007 arnold et al 2015 also pointed out the importance of accurate representation of model processes and its impact on calibration and following scenario analysis these findings highlight the importance of improving process representation in addition to parameter calibration to ensure reliability of watershed model simulation the swat model was originally designed to simulate large scale ungauged watersheds arnold et al 1998 up to date only a few studies have evaluated swat performance under ungauged conditions e g srinivasan et al 2010 in this study we aimed to evaluate the value of advancing soil energy and biogeochemical processes in swat for simulating water quality in a large river basin i e the upper mississippi river basin umrb under ungauged conditions here we evaluated an enhanced version of swat2012 referred to as swat ec hereafter which has integrated an energy balanced soil temperature module stm and the centruy based soil organic matter algorithm and compared it against the original swat2012 to understand which algorithms contribute to the improvements in swat ec we also investigated performance of swat2012 with centruy referred to as swat c and swat2012 with the energy balanced soil temperature module referred to as swat e the four versions of swat models were not calibrated and were evaluated against monthly and annual streamflow sediment nitrate no3 n and total nitrogen tn loadings at three gauging stations near the outlet of umrb multiple widely used statistics were used to evaluate the performance difference between different versions of swat models to put the model performance in context we also compared the uncalibrated swat models developed in this study with previous studies that reported performance of swat with calibration we anticipate the results will help understand the value of advancing processes representation in swat for water quality modeling in large scale ungauged basins 2 data and model description 2 1 modifications made to swat2012 2 1 1 physically based soil temperature module in swat2012 soil temperature tsoil is calculated at the center of a soil layer z on the hydrologic response unit hru scale with the following equation neitsch 2011 1 t soil z γ t soil z 1 γ d t aair t sur t sur where γ is the lag coefficient controlling the influence of the previous day s temperature on the current day s temperature tsoil is the soil temperature from the previous day at depth z d is the depth factor that quantifies the influence of depth on soil temperature t aair is the average annual air temperature and tsur is the soil surface temperature on the day the depth factor is a function of depth at the center of the soil layer z maximum damping depth bulk density and soil water the soil surface temperature is a function of the previous day s temperature the amount of ground cover and the bare soil temperature the effects of snow and plant canopy cover on soil temperature are incorporated empirically as a weighting factor the bare soil temperature is a function of daily average minimum and maximum temperature as well as solar radiation reaching the ground and albedo a physically based and energy balanced stm has been developed and implemented based on heat transfer theory qi et al 2016b 2 t t x k c t x s c where t is the temperature c t represents the time step in days k is the thermal conductivity j cm 1 d 1 c 1 c is the volumetric heat capacity j cm 3 c 1 x is the vertical distance from the air soil or air snow interface cm and s is the latent heat source sink term j cm 3 d 1 the eq 2 is converted to a fully implicit discretized form and was solved with the tridiagonal matrix algorithm described in patankar 1980 the simulation domain was defined as extending from the air soil or air snow interface upper boundary to the damping depth lower boundary where the impact of air temperature diminishes the temperature was calculated at the center of each soil layer for individual hru when snow accumulated on the ground the snow cover was treated as a single layer heat capacity and thermal conductivity were assumed to be uniform within individual layers stm can address the intermediary role of snow cover in the daily evolution of the soil temperature profile which is important for the application of swat in cold climate regions of the world instead of considering soil temperature as a function of air temperature by the empirical soil temperature module within swat stm simulates temperature change in snow and soils as a result of heat conduction and latent heat exchange the new module can estimate snow or soil surface temperature based on energy balance update thermal properties of snow and soils according to changes in snow density and soil moisture and simulate freeze thaw cycles in the soil profile stm has tested with field observed temperatures from a small experimental watershed in atlantic canada qi et al 2016b demonstrating a great improvement in prediction of soil temperatures 2 1 2 century based soil organic matter algorithms in swat2012 and previous versions a papran model seligman and keulen 1980 has been used to simulate organic nitrogen cycling the papran model considers organic n in plant residue and active and stable humus pools the decomposition of each pool is influenced by water temperature c n ratio and intrinsic properties of substrate neitsch et al 2011 one of the drawbacks of the papran model that it does not explicitly simulate carbon cycling in soil which is closely coupled with nitrogen cycling on the other hand the century model parton et al 1994 considers both c and n cycling and represents soil organic matter som and residue in five pools plant litter is split into a metabolic carbon pool e g proteins and sugars and a recalcitrant structural carbon pool e g lignin and cell walls century also has an amicrobial biomass pool soil humus includes two pools slow humus pool receives c and n from the decomposition of structural litter metabolic litter and microbial biomass and often has a turnover time of 20 50 years while passive humus pool includes physically and chemically stabilized som absorbed to clays and may take hundreds to thousands of years to decompose the decomposition of each pool is determined by multiple factors such as water temperature tillage c n ratio oxygen availability soil texture and substrate specific properties the major difference between papran and century lies in how detailed they represent som residue how the decomposition rates are calculated and the coupling between c and n cycling in general century incorporates more detailed biochemical properties and environmental factors in describing the processes relevant to som residue dynamics zhang et al 2013 yang et al 2017 and yang and zhang 2016 successfully tested the century algorithm for simulating c and n progress using 16 ameriflux agricultural sites http public ornl gov ameriflux in the us midwest and three long term ecological research lter sites at the kellogg biological station kbs https lter kbs msu edu in southern michigan however the century algorithm in swat has not been tested for benefiting nutrients cycling modeling in large ungauged basins 2 2 study area the umrb drains an area of 431 000 km2 from northern minnesota to its confluence with the ohio river at the southern tip of illinois fig 1 srinivasan et al 2010 the states of illinois iowa minnesota missouri and wisconsin constitute most of the drainage area of umrb fig 1 arnold et al 2000 while indiana michigan and south dakota together constitute a minor portion 15 percent of the watershed land cover in the basin is diverse and includes agricultural lands forest wetlands lakes prairies and urban areas overall agriculture is the dominant land use and nearly 69 of total land is used for agriculture and pasture with corn soybeans and alfalfa as the major crops in the basin wu and tanaka 2005 due to its vast and complex landscapes coupled with intensive agricultural activities landscape management and widespread use of chemical fertilizers umrb is recognized as a major contributor more than 50 percent of the nitrogen transported to the gulf of mexico wu and tanaka 2005 the average annual precipitation ranges from 575 mm in the western part of minnesota to 981 mm in the central part of illinois and the average monthly maximum temperature ranging from 9 8 c in january in central minnesota to 31 7 c in july in central missouri wu and tanaka 2005 soil type in the basin ranges from heavy poorly drained clay soil to light well drained sands 2 3 swat model setup the swat model requires a variety of detailed information describing the land use soil and topography data of the umrb the present study adopted the input data from srinivasan et al 2010 and compared the performance of different swat models the umrb was divided into 131 subbasins according to the eight digit united states geological survey usgs hydrologic unit codes hucs fig 1 national hydrography dataset nhd stream dataset and a 90 m digital elevation model dem was used to provide watershed configuration and topographic parameter estimation a land use map was created by combining two sources of information i e the cropland data layer cdl and 2001 national land cover data to better define cultivated and non agricultural land use the state soil geographic statsgo database 1 250 000 scale soil map was used for umrb using a threshold operation of 5 for land use 10 for soil and 5 for slope 14 568 hrus were generated and the number of hrus per subbasin ranged from 58 to 216 management practices such as tile drainage tillage crop rotation and fertilizer application were included in the project according to various sources to save space here we only provide brief description of the input data and detailed model setup information can be found in srinivasan et al 2010 the fertilization rates followed the state values reported by unite states department of agriculture economic research service 1 1 https www ers usda gov data products fertilizer use and price aspx for tile drainage we used statsgo soil databased to identify those locations that are poorly drained with a slope less than 1 and under agricultural land use tillage intensity information at the county scale is obtained from the conservation technology information center ctic 2 2 www ctic purdue edu we represented conservation reduced tillage and full tillage according to slope deepness sorted agricultural hrus in ascending order according to slope and try to assign full tillage to low slope hrus and reduced tillage and conservation tillage for hrus with deep slopes 2 4 weather data the swat model requires daily values of precipitation max min air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed as forcing data here we used daily precipitation max min air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed derived from phase 2 of the north american land data assimilation system nldas2 3 3 ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas climate forcing data has assimilated multiple sources of climate observations and is widely recognized as a high resolution 1 8 spatially continuous and comprehensive dataset that is valuable for water cycling studies xia et al 2012 the data ranges from 01 to 01 1979 to present the spatial domain spatial resolution computational grid terrain height and land mask of nldas2 are identical to that in nldas1 which is described in mitchell et al 2004 we aggregated the gridded daily values of nldas2 data to the eight digit subbasins using standard arcgis aggregation procedures as a result 131 weather datasets one for each subbasin were created to input into the swat model 2 5 streamflow and water quality data streamflow data were obtained from us geological survey usgs for the period of 1981 1997 monthly sediment nitrate and organic nitrogen flux data were obtained from the usgs upper midwest environmental science center umesc for the period of 1981 1997 fig 1 shows the usgs gauging station locations that provided observed data used in comparisons table 1 shows the drainage area indicated by usgs and swat and the time period during which observed data were available because the usgs gauge location may not always correspond to the outlet of the hucs there will be some difference between the two areas in addition table 1 provides the time period of data available for comparison 2 6 model evaluation in this study we evaluated four versions of swat i e swat ec swat c swat e and swat2012 fig 2 swat ec has integrated the energy balanced soil temperature module stm and the centruy based soil organic matter algorithm swat c only integrated the centruy based soil organic matter algorithm swat e only integrated the energy balanced soil temperature module fig 2 the four versions of swat models were not calibrated and were evaluated against monthly and annual streamflow sediment nitrate no3 n and total nitrogen tn loadings at three gauging stations near the outlet of umrb model performance was assessed using three coefficients of accuracy i e percent bias pbias coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 the equations used to calculate the above three statistics are given as 3 p bias 100 o avg p avg o avg 4 ns 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o avg 2 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o avg p i p avg i 1 n o i o avg 2 i 1 n p i p avg 2 0 5 2 where oi and pi are the observed and predicted values at a time step i oavg and pavg are the average of the observed and predicted values table 1 shows the basic characteristics of the usgs stations used for model performance evaluation 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of four versions of swat model with respect to different water quantity and quality variables model performance evaluation results on stream flow and sediment no3 n and tn loadings at three usgs gauging stations at monthly and annual scales are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively the evaluation periods for usgs gauging stations corresponding to the outlets of subbasin 63 and 100 is from 1980 to 1987 and from 1980 to 1988 respectively while for the station at the outlet of subbasin 95 is from 1991 to 1997 in the table shaded numbers indicate the three versions of enhanced swat model i e swat c swat e and swat ec performed less than swat2012 average annual basin values for major hydrology and nitrogen cycle components from 1980 to 1997 simulated by four versions of swat model are shown in table 4 3 1 1 streamflow for monthly streamflow simulation all three enhanced swat i e swat c swat e and swat ec outperformed swat2012 table 2 swat c performed modestly better than swat2012 in terms of all three statistics and at all three stations that is swat c both explained more monthly variation and reduced overall bias compared with swat2012 swat e achieved much better simulation of monthly streamflow but slightly increased pbias by 1 for all three stations comparison between swat c and swat e indicates that swat c performed better in terms of reducing overall bias while swat e was better regarding capturing variability of monthly streamflow swat ec seems to benefit from the advantage of both swat c and swat c and pronouncedly outperformed swat2012 in terms of explaining variations in monthly streamflow and reducing overall bias on the annual scale model performance for the four versions of swat model in general followed the pattern observed except that swat e slightly performed less than swat2012 in terms of ns at the outlets of subbasin 95 and 100 table 3 by analyzing the average annual values of key hydrologic budget components table 4 we found that swat c simulated lower average annual et and higher average annual surface runoff lateral flow and baseflow than swat2012 even though water flow through different pathways were increased by swat c average annual no3 n loadings transported with those water flows became less than those of swat2012 table 4 mainly because the century method generated less nitrate in soils compared with papran swat e pronouncedly improved streamflow simulation compared with swat2012 because with stm swat e tended to generate more infiltration and less surface runoff during winter and the snowmelt season on the watershed scale qi et al 2016a this is also can be seen from table 4 where average annual surface runoff 85 mm generated with swat e was less than that 113 mm of swat2012 and average annual lateral flow and baseflow 39 and 109 mm respectively generated with swat e were greater than those 30 and 92 mm respectively of swat2012 the new stm more realistically accounted for snowpack insulation effects on soil temperature allowing surface soil layers to remain unfrozen when snow accumulating on the ground as a result swat e improved its simulation on hydrological effects of unfrozen soil during winter and the snowmelt seasons 3 1 2 sediment like streamflow simulation all three enhanced versions of swat model attained higher r2 and ns values than the corresponding values of swat2012 at all three stations notably swat ec achieved the highest r2 and ns values among all four models at all three stations except for r2 at the outlet of subbasin 63 which is slightly less than the r2 of swat e table 2 swat e outperformed swat c with respect to r2 and ns values compared with swat2012 swat c reduced pbais values generated more sediment loadings while swat e increased pbias values generated less sediment loadings which is the major factor explaining the reduced pbias values of swat ec that fall somewhere between those by swat c and swat e table 2 the reason for reduced pbias by swat c is that swat c generated more stream flow as explained in the previous section and table 4 while swat e generated less stream flow and caused increases in pbias on the annual scale model performance for the four versions of swat model generally follows the pattern observed on the monthly scale except that swat ec performed less than swat2012 at two stations in terms of r2 and or ns table 3 although we did not directly modify algorithms of erosion from uplands and sediment deposition and resuspension processes in streams due to the fact that surface runoff and stream flow are closely correlated with sediment generation and transport especially at the monthly scale improved simulation of surface runoff and stream flow led to improved simulation of monthly variability of sediment loading as indicated by the comparison results 3 1 3 nitrate different from model performance comparison results for stream flow and sediment loading no clear pattern was identified for no3 n loading that is model performance evaluation results are in general mixed swat c had greater r2 at the outlet of subbasin 95 and greater ns at the outlets of subbasin 63 and 100 than swat2012 table 2 although swat e attained greater r2 for all three stations than swat2012 it only had one station with a greater ns than swat2012 table 2 the absolute values of pbias of swat c and swat e were all larger than those of swat2012 except that swat e had lower bias at the outlet of subbasin 63 table 2 with examination of the pbias values of different versions of swat model we found that as compared with swat2012 swat c distinctly increased pbias less nitrate loadings while swat e reduced pbias more nitrate loadings as swat ec merged both swat c and swat e its pbias values fall somewhere between those of swat c and swat e and as a result the absolute pbias values of swat ec were in general less than those of swat2012 the difference is negligible at the outlet of subbasin 100 i e 0 of swat2012 vs 2 of swat ec table 2 in addition swat ec outperformed swat2012 in terms of most of r2 and ns values at the three stations except for r2 value at the outlet of subbasin 100 table 2 the increased pbias values for swat c is partially explained by lower average annual no3 n loadings transported with different water flows compared with those of swat2012 table 4 since swat e simulated more infiltration than swat2012 in areas with seasonal snow cover during winter and the snowmelt season more nitrate was leached and exported to streams as compared with swat2012 this is consistent with increased average annual no3 n loadings transported with lateral flow and baseflow and decreased average annual no3 n loadings transported with surface runoff compared with those of swat2012 table 4 overall these changes in swat e caused the reduction in pbias values at the watershed scale as compared with swat2012 qi et al 2016a in general swat ec balances the strength and weakness of swat c and swat e and achieved an overall better model performance on no3 n loading than swat2012 on the monthly scale table 2 on the annual scale model performance results are like the monthly scale findings table 3 3 1 4 total nitrogen the four models exhibited similar performance for simulating no3 n and tn mainly because no3 n accounts for a major portion of tn like the model comparison for nitrate simulation no single model outperformed the others at all stations and for all evaluation statistics for instance swat c had lower values of r2 but higher ns values than swat2012 at all three stations table 2 swat e attained higher values of r2 but lower ns values than swat2012 at three stations table 2 in general swat2012 and swat e tended to overestimate tn while swat c exhibited underestimation table 2 swat ec better captured seasonal variability of tn and achieved lower bias than swat2012 at all three stations except for higher bias at the outlet of subbasin 63 table 2 the annual results table 3 also confirmed the advantage of integrating advanced biogeochemical and energy balanced algorithms for achieving improved simulation of nitrogen loading in large scale ungauged basins 3 2 monthly examination of the results by swat2012 and swat ec the observed and simulated monthly stream flow and sediment no3 n and tn loadings by swat2012 and swat ec at the three stations respectively shown in figs 3 4 and 5 the swat ec model was found to have slightly damped snowmelt flow peaks compared with swat2012 leading to improved model performance as indicated in tables 2 and 3 as stated in section 3 1 1 swat ec tends to generate more infiltration and less surface runoff during winter and snowmelt seasons because the stm accounts for snow insulation effects on soil temperature leading to surface soil layers remaining unfrozen when snow cover presents both versions of swat model tended to underestimate sediment loading peaks during the spring snowmelt season especially at the outlets of subbasin 63 and 100 fig 3b and 5b which explained the relatively large pbias shown in tables 2 and 3 compared with swat2012 swat ec obtained less sediment loading peaks because it generated less surface runoff fig 3b 4b and 5b furthermore swat2012 tended to generate sediment loading peaks ahead of observed peaks about one month earlier while swat ec simulated sediment loading peaks matched well the timing of observation note that the sediment loading peaks generated by swat ec were less than those generated by the swat2012 fig 3b 4b and 5b mainly due to lower surface runoff both versions of swat model tended to underestimate no3 n loading peaks during snowmelt season at the outlets of subbasin 63 from 1980 to 1987 and overestimate them at the outlet of subbasin 95 from 1991 to 1997 fig 3c and 4c such a shift in model performance over time may be caused by the lack of detailed fertilization data over years and at fine scales that are required for accurate nutrient loss simulation compared with swat2012 swat ec generated much more no3 n loadings at the outlet of subbasin 63 and less no3 n loadings at the outlet of subbasin 95 during snowmelt season which is a major reason explaining the improvement in model performance for no3 n loading both models performed well at the outlet of subbasin 100 with swat ec performed slightly better fig 5c and table 2 in addition swat2012 tended to overestimate tn loading peaks during snowmelt period at all three stations while tn loading peaks simulated by swat ec were more consistent with observations fig 3c 4c and 5c which explained the improvement in model performance of tn loading as shown in tables 2 and 3 the overall improvement of swat ec over swat2012 for simulating no3 n and tn is the result of combining the strengths from swat c and swat e as shown in table 2 swat e contributed more to the improvements in swat ec with respect to explaining variability of hydrology and sediment yield while contribution from swat c modestly improved bias in streamflow and sediment yield simulation as to nitrate and tn neither swat c nor swat e clearly outperformed swat2012 for example swat e performed less than swat2012 in terms of both ns and pbias in simulating tn for all stations while swat c had larger bias at all stations from simulation of nitrate these results demonstrate the complexity and combined efforts of energy and biogeochemical processes on hydrology and water quality and highlight the importance of advancing the coupled water energy biogeochemistry processes within swat toward better watershed modeling and assessment based on ns and pbias values generated by swat ec model performance was satisfactory for stream flow ns 0 5 and pbais 25 at all three gauging stations on the monthly scale swat ec performances on sediment loading were also satisfactory ns 0 5 and pbias 55 at these stations statistic values were all falling into satisfactory category for no3 n and total n simulation on the monthly scale moriasi et al 2007 except for ns for subbasin 95 0 02 for no3 n and 0 18 for tn these results demonstrate the potential of advancing process representation in swat to achieve satisfactory simulation of water quality in large scale ungauged basins 3 3 assessment of a simple multi model approach multi model approaches often help reduce uncertainty in hydrological predictions and improve model predictability because a combination of predictions from many single models could synergize the strength of these single models li and sankarasubramanian 2012 multi model predictions are usually obtained by taking a weighted average of the predictions from the single models the weights sum up to one the weights can be derived from several multi model combination methods including weighted average of single model predictions or using statistical techniques e g multiple linear regression and bayesian model averaging duan et al 2007 krishnamurti et al 1999 marshall et al 2006 oudin et al 2006 shamseldin et al 1997 in this study we used the simple equal weighted method to assess model performance on monthly water quality and quantity prediction specifically an ensemble simulation was generated by taking the average of the four simulations by the four versions of swat i e swat2012 swat e swat c and swat ec for streamflow sediment no3 n and total n correspondingly three statistics i e r2 ns and pbias were calculated for the new ensemble simulation table 5 in comparison with the statistical values shown table 3 the ensemble simulation generally performed better than then poorest single model but less than the best single model this result indicates that a simple average of the four swat models may not yield better performance however more advanced methods e g multiple linear regression or bayesian model averaging deserve research to combine different model structures to achieve more accurate hydrologic and water quality modeling in the future 3 4 comparison with previous studies multiple studies have been conducted to simulate water quantity and quality in the umrb using calibrated versions of swat arnold et al 2000 jha et al 2006 jha et al 2004 jha et al 2015 wu et al 2012 as for water quality variables only sediment and no3 n loading simulation results were reported in two studies jha et al 2006 jha et al 2015 we summarized the model performance evaluated based on r2 and ns from those studies to put the performance of the four versions of swat examined in context the statistics values reported in previous studies are shown in table 6 as those previous studies only reported results at the gauging station at the outlet of umrb i e usgs gauge 05587450 the comparison between our results and previous studies was only conducted at this site for sediment loading simulation compared with jha et al s 2006 results in their calibration period r2 0 66 and ns 0 66 swat2012 had lower r2 and ns values r2 0 57 and ns 0 48 while swat ec achieved higher r2 0 77 and comparable ns 0 62 on the monthly scale on the annual scale both swat2012 and swat ec attained greater r2 0 83 and 0 85 respectively and less ns 0 44 and 0 47 respectively values than those r2 0 77 and ns 0 69 of jha et al 2006 for their calibration period considering the different periods of dataset used in model evaluation 1980 1988 for present study vs 1981 1992 for jha et al 2006 it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion however it is fair to conclude that our sediment simulation evaluation is comparable to those reported previous since no previous study reported swat performance on monthly no3 n loading we only compared our annual results to those reported by jha et al 2015 both swat2012 and swat ec models attained higher r2 0 82 and 0 84 respectively and ns 0 68 and 0 83 respectively values than those r2 0 62 and ns 0 46 of jha et al 2015 reported for the period of 1981 2003 again due to the difference in the periods of data used in this study 1981 1988 and by jha et al 2015 1981 2003 we could not conclude that the two uncalibrated versions of swat performed better but the comparison between the statistics shows the promise of using the latest released swat model and the enhanced swat with respect to energy and biogeochemistry to achieve satisfactory simulation of nitrate loading in ungauged basin 4 conclusions in the present study we evaluated swat2012 and three enhanced versions i e swat c swat e and swat ec which integrates a centruy based soil organic matter module an energy balanced soil temperature module stm and both century and stm respectively for simulating water quality variables in the upper mississippi river basin umrb under ungauged conditions we found that both swat c and swat e improved hydrology and sediment simulations as compared with swat2012 where swat c helped reduce overall bias and swat e better captured seasonality particularly during winter and snowmelt seasons swat ec combined the strengths of both swat c and swat e leading to much improved explanation of monthly variation and comparable biases as compared with swat2012 as to nitrate no3 n and total nitrogen tn neither swat c nor swat e clearly outperformed swat2012 which demonstrate the complexity and combined efforts of energy and biogeochemical processes on hydrology and water quality in general swat c performance is similar to that of swat2012 while swat e improved simulation of spring fluxes of no3 n and tn again swat ec benefited from both swat c and swat e and for most cases achieved better results than swat2012 in terms of explaining observed data variability and reducing simulation biases based on the model evaluation criteria summarized in moriasi et al 2007 the performance of the uncalibrated swat ec model was categorized as satisfactory and was comparable to calibrated swat models reported in previous studies overall our results demonstrate the value of advancing process representation in physically based watershed models to improve model credibility particularly in ungauged basins we anticipate that the new model development efforts will benefit future watershed modeling and assessment efforts in
