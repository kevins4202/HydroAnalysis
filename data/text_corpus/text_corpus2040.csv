10200,understanding farmers decision making on crop choices and water use is essential for agricultural water resource management however previous studies have limited understanding of how farmers behavioral characteristics affect their crop choices and water use in agricultural systems to fill this research gap in this study we develop an agent based model abm that incorporates two types of behavioral characteristics i e perception to the uncertainty in future crop prices planting cost and precipitation and tolerance to the variation of crop profits to investigate their effects on crop choices and water use under the influence of water management policies the abm is applied to the heihe river basin hrb an arid endorheic river basin in northwestern china as a demonstration the modeling results show that farmers with adventurous perceptions and high tolerance level type i tend to choose high profit crops they are more likely to have a single crop pattern with high crop profits and high water consumption in comparison farmers with cautious perceptions and low tolerance level type ii prefer steady profit crops they typically pay more attention to the variation of crop profits resulting in a mixed crop pattern with low crop profits and low water consumption in addition the two types of farmers exhibit varied responses to water management policies the type i farmers are more sensitive to the changes in the volume of water permits and irrigation efficiency and as a result are more sensitive to the changes of water management policies than the type ii farmers do we also find that the effects of farmers behavioral characteristics vary at the irrigation district level county level and entire study area level these findings emphasize the importance of incorporating farmers behavioral characteristics into crop choice and water use models the modeling result could provide policy implications for designing location based water management policies that account for the heterogeneity in farmers behavioral characteristics and responses to water policies keywords agent based model agricultural water management crop choice endorheic basin heihe river basin 1 introduction water is an essential natural resource for social economic and environmental development oki and kanae 2006 however with the rapidly growing human population changing climate conditions and intensifying anthropogenic activities water scarcity has become a severe issue globally dietz et al 2003 harmancioglu 2017 by 2025 1 8 billion people are estimated to face water scarcity wwap 2014 among multiple water use sectors agriculture is the largest water consumer accounting for approximately 70 of the total freshwater consumption fao 2008 maeda et al 2011 sauer et al 2010 zhang and vesselinov 2017 in endorheic basins this proportion is even higher than 70 li et al 2017 which emphasizes the importance of effective water resource management in these river basins most of the endorheic basins are located in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2018a 2018b crop production is highly dependent on irrigation due to the limited water supply from precipitation tanji and kielen 2002 in some regions irrigation accounts for more than 90 of the total freshwater consumption li et al 2017 thus many endorheic basins have suffered from a variety of environmental and ecological problems such as groundwater decline downstream cutoﬀ lake shrinkage land degradation storms and other disasters huang et al 2017 li et al 2018a 2018b lu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 therefore it is important to establish effective agricultural water resource management policies in these regions to achieve a balance among the economy ecology and environment farmers crop choices have a great influence on agricultural water use it is important to understand farmers crop choices to manage agricultural water use several studies have been conducted for this purpose by simulating farmers crop choices the optimization approach is one of the main strategies considered by researchers ghasemi et al 2016 montazar et al 2010 many of these studies took farmers as rational agents and determined their crop choices by optimizing objective functions according to physical and economic constraints aljanabi et al 2018 das et al 2015 davidsen et al 2015 however these studies are limited as growing evidence from empirical studies has demonstrated that farmers are boundedly rational farmers behavioral characteristics such as their perception and tolerance to future uncertainties also play important roles in crop choice decision making artikov et al 2006 dury et al 2013 van duinen et al 2015 2016 therefore it is necessary to incorporate these behavioral characteristics to investigate farmers crop choices in recent years agent based model abm have been widely used to analyze complex systems such as water resource systems akhbari and grigg 2013 2015 ng et al 2011 yang et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 unlike the traditional top down approach abms employ a bottom up perspective the main cores of abms are autonomous agents which are embedded with a set of heterogeneous characteristics behavioral rules and the surrounding environment an 2012 an et al 2014 the emergence at the top level can be predicted by simulating the decision making of agents at the bottom level previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of applying abms for understanding complicated issues in water resource systems including water quality management ng et al 2011 groundwater management castilla rho et al 2015 mulligan et al 2014 noël and cai 2017 and domestic water management galán et al 2009 mashhadi ali et al 2017 because abms can explicitly exhibit the factors influencing the decision making process for example ng et al 2011 formulated an abm using a combination of behavioral factors to explore the best management practices bmps in agricultural systems with biofuel development and a water quality market du et al 2017a incorporated farmers behavioral parameters in an abm to investigate the influence of these parameters on the agricultural water market and crop production these studies demonstrated the feasibility of using abms to present farmers behavioral characteristics through behavioral factors and further explore the farmers decision making process in this study we focus on modeling farmers crop choices and water use decisions in the agricultural system of the heihe river basin hrb the second largest endorheic basin in northwestern china the hrb covers an area of approximately 1 4 105 km2 li et al 2018a 2018b the artificial oasis in the middle reach is a traditional grain production base in the arid area of china with maize for seed and wheat for grain as the two main crops deng et al 2017 liu et al 2016 the middle reach oasis provides seeds for nearly 40 of the corn in china with limited precipitation 140 mm year crop production in the hrb highly relies on artificial irrigation accounting for more than 93 of the water resource consumption in the basin wang et al 2015 in recent years the basin has experienced a noticeable shift between two major crops i e maize and wheat maize is more economically profitable than wheat but demands more water as more farmers have planted maize in the hrb water consumption has increased dramatically understanding the mechanisms behind farmers crop choices can help with designing effective water management policies for agricultural water resource management in the hrb and many other regions following the previous work by ng et al 2011 and hu et al 2015 in this study we built an abm to simulate farmers crop choices under the influence of two behavioral characteristics namely perception to future crop prices planting costs and precipitation and tolerance to profit variations we apply the model to the zhangye district in the middle reach of the hrb to understand how these behavioral parameters affect farmers decision making related to two crops i e maize and wheat and their responses to water management policies with the modeling framework we aim to answer the following questions 1 how will farmers behavior characteristics affect their crop choices 2 how will farmers crop choices affect the crop pattern crop profits and water use and 3 how will farmers behavioral characteristics affect the performances of water management policies the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area as well as the data sources and explains the model structure and details of our abm section 3 presents the results of applying the model to the hrb section 4 discusses the implications of these results conclusions limitations and future work are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hrb is located in the arid area of northwestern china covering qinghai province gansu province and inner mongolia the area of the basin is approximately 1 4 105 km2 the heihe river which is the major river in the watershed originates from the qilian mountains flows through yingluo valley then northward into the middle reach which is an artificial oasis called the zhangye district and finally flows out at zhengyi valley into two terminal lakes in the gobi desert li et al 2018a 2018b lu et al 2015 the study site is located in the zhangye district in the middle reach of the hrb fig 1 the zhangye district has a total area of 1 07 104 km2 consisting of ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county of zhangye city this region is the most developed agricultural area in the hrb accounting for 95 of the total cultivation land more than 90 of the total water consumption in the hrb is used for agricultural production there are 17 irrigation districts 6 of which are in ganzhou district 6 in linze county and the other 5 in gaotai county most of the large irrigation districts are in ganzhou district the elevation ranges from 1300 to 3600 m and 94 of the area is lower than 2000 m the mean annual precipitation is approximately 140 mm while the annual evaporation reaches 1600 2400 mm the main crops are maize and wheat which are both planted annually the irrigation water of this region mainly comes from surface water and rainfall recently cropping systems have undergone intense transformation from maize to wheat 2 2 data sources data from multiple sources were collected at the study site including agronomic data economic data historical meteorological data and institutional data as shown in table 1 agronomic data were mainly obtained from previous work and field survey results li et al 2018a 2018b xiao et al 2018 the land cover data were derived from the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater land cover map of heihe river basin dataset from the cold and arid regions science data center at lanzhou li et al 2013 zhong et al 2014 2015 the dataset was obtained from hj 1 ccd remote sensing images with a high spatial resolution of 30 m and a period from 2011 to 2015 the data from may and june were used to extract the area of maize and wheat depending on the crop phenophase economic data e g historical crop prices and costs from 2005 to 2015 were obtained from the zhangye and china statistical yearbook and annual reports meteorological data were obtained from the two meteorological stations in the study region zhangye station and gaotai station the precipitation datasets used in this study were calculated as the average annual precipitation at the two stations from 2005 to 2015 lu et al 2015 institutional data such as the boundaries and locations of irrigation districts were obtained from hiwater irrigation water permit quota data for each irrigation district were extracted from the annual water resource management reports 2011 2015 published by the zhangye municipal bureau of water conservancy 2 3 model description in this study an abm was developed to investigate the effects of farmers behavioral characteristics regarding crop choices and their responses to different water policies the abm consists of 17 agents each agent represents an irrigation district in the study area the agents differ from each other in terms of available cultivation area and amount of water available two types of farmers and crops are considered in the abm there are five components in the abm gray boxes in fig 2 the bayesian learning module crop yield and profit module optimization module agent generation module and scenario design module which are detailed in the following sections 2 3 1 bayesian learning module a farmer s crop choices can be affected by many variables such as planting cost crop price and water availability these variables are typically subject to some uncertainty due to uncertain climate and social economic conditions in the future e g a few months later in the face of uncertainty a farmer may adopt different strategies when estimating these variables to make crop choice decisions some studies have applied the bayesian learning method to simulate how farmers predict future crop prices and precipitation based on historical crop prices and precipitation respectively an 2012 conley and udry 2010 gars and ward 2019 ma and shi 2015 in this study we followed these previous works and used the bayesian learning method to formulate farmers perceptions about a variable in the future e g crop price based on historical observations e g crop prices over the past several years we assumed that all variables were normally distributed x n μ σ 2 thus we estimated the mean μ and variance σ 2 based on past observations of the variable by eq 1 which is called the likelihood function 1 l μ σ 2 d p d μ σ 2 1 2 π n 2 σ 2 n 2 exp 1 2 σ 2 n i 1 n x t x 2 n x μ 2 where d x 1 x 2 x t t 1 2 n is a set of past observations x t indicates the observation at time t which is assumed to be independent and identically distributed x is the mean of d n is the number of d and μ and σ 2 are the mean and variance of the likelihood function respectively however each farmer has initial private knowledge of μ and σ 2 which is called prior knowledge and one farmer s prior knowledge may be different from another s knowledge to express the differences we used normal inverse chi squared n i χ 2 to define the farmers prior knowledge as shown by eq 2 murphy 2007 2 p μ σ 2 n i χ 2 μ 0 κ 0 ν 0 σ 0 2 n μ μ 0 σ 2 κ 0 χ 2 σ 2 ν 0 σ 0 2 where μ 0 is the prior mean and κ 0 indicates how strongly a farmer believes μ 0 is the true value of the mean similarly σ 0 2 is the prior variance and ν 0 indicates how strongly a farmer believes σ 0 2 is the true value of the variance through bayes theorem we can obtain the prediction of the variable called the posterior distribution eq 3 3 p μ σ 2 d n i χ 2 μ n κ n ν n σ n 2 μ n κ 0 μ 0 n x κ n κ n κ 0 n ν n ν 0 n σ n 2 1 ν n ν 0 σ 0 2 i x t x 2 n κ 0 κ 0 n μ 0 x where μ n σ n 2 is the posterior mean variance κ n indicates how strongly a farmer believes μ n is the posterior mean and ν n indicates how strongly a farmer believes σ n 2 is the posterior variance combining eqs 1 3 with bayes theorem we can deduce the posterior distribution of a variable as student t distribution as shown in eq 4 with which a farmer can predict the value of a variable 4 p x d t v n μ n 1 κ n σ n 2 κ n where parameters ν n μ n 1 κ n σ n 2 κ n represent the degrees of freedom the expectation and variance of a predicted variable respectively it can be seen that a farmer s perception can be affected by his individual behavioral parameters i e κ and ν with the bayesian learning module farmers can predict the mean and variance of crop prices planting costs and precipitation accordingly 2 3 2 crop yield and profit module this model consists of two parts one part is to calculate the crop yield based on the crop yield function and the other part is to calculate crop profit based on the calculated crop yield the crop yield function used in this study can be described as eq 5 palazzo 2009 5 y j y m j 1 1 i r j e t c j p e 1 β where y j and y m j are the crop yield and maximum crop yield without water stress for crop j j indicates maize or wheat kg mu i r j is the irrigation water depth for crop j m e t c j is the potential crop evapotranspiration of crop j m p e is effective rainfall during the crop growth season m and β is the irrigation efficiency whose original value is 60 then the crop profit is obtained through eq 6 6 π j n π j j 1 n a j c p j c c j y j w p i j where π is the total profit yuan π j is the profit of crop j yuan n is the number of crop types taken into account a j is the cultivation area of crop j mu c p j and c c j are the price and planting cost of crop j yuan mu respectively w p is the water price which is 0 2 yuan m3 in the study region in this study two main crops maize and wheat were evaluated table 2 the agronomic parameters associated with the two crops in the study site were obtained from previous literature and field surveys 2 3 3 optimization module we assume farmers are utility optimizers and will plant the most profitable crops on their farmlands in this study farmer s decision for crop planting is made at the annual time step which is consistent with crop planting schedule in our study site a two stage optimization approach was adopted here to simulate farmers decision making processes i e crop choice and irrigation scheduling which are described as follows at the first stage i e the planning stage farmers make plan on crop planting area for each type of crop when climate and market conditions e g precipitation crop price planting cost etc are unknown farmers use historical data to estimate these variables based on the bayesian learning model as described in eqs 3 and 4 uncertainties arise from farmers perceptions of these variables farmers attempt to balance the crop profits and risks associated with the uncertainties to mimic this decision making process a mean standard deviation type of utility is used as shown in eq 7 bannister et al 2016 pyle and turnovsky 1970 7 u π e π γ σ π where π is crop profit u π is farmers utility to be maximized in decision making processes e π and σ π are the expected value and standard deviation of crop profit and γ measures farmers tolerance to the fluctuations of crop profits farmers with a larger value of γ have lower tolerance level farmers objective function in crop planning stage is described by eq 8 8 maximize u π constraints j 1 n a j p a j 1 n a j p i p j t w a 0 i p j e t c p e 0 a j p a where a j p is the planned planting area for crop j mu a widely used unit to measure land area in china and 1 mu is around 667 m2 a is the total available cultivation area mu t w a is the total water amount derived from irrigation water permit datasets m3 and i p j is the planned irrigation depth m at this stage the planned planting area a j p is determined and passed to the second stage as the upper bound of the final planting area for crop j at the second stage the objective is to maximize crop profit based on the actual observed climate and market variables described in eqs 5 and 6 the decision variables at this stage are the final planted crop area and irrigation water depth for each crop the decision process at this stage can be formulated as eq 9 9 maximize π constraints j 1 n a j i j t w a 0 a j a j p 0 i j e t c p e where a j is the final planting area for crop j which is between 0 and the planned planting area a j p determined at first stage note that there will be some areas growing no crop if actual climate and market conditions are not perfectly ideal for crop growth i j is the irrigation water depth for crop j after the two stage optimization the planting area and total amount of water for each crop are determined and the total crop profit can be calculated by eqs 5 and 6 accordingly 2 3 4 agent generation module at the initial phase of the abm this model was used to create agents with two behavioral characteristics perception and tolerance through three factors i e κ ν and γ derived from the bayesian learning model and optimization model this study modeled two types of farmers i e adventurous versus conservative based on theoretical behavioral theories as well as our empirical engagements with local farmers in the study area existing studies have widely applied the two representative behaviors to modeling farmers decision making in agricultural systems flaten et al 2005 he et al 2018 migliore et al 2015 sulewski and kłoczko gajewska 2014 these studies have shown that the two types of behaviors can well mimic a wide range of farmers agricultural practices in the real world moreover through interviews with local famers and literature surveys it is evidenced that local farmers empirical behaviors in the face of various water management policies hydrological and market conditions agree with the theoretical farmer behaviors reported in the literature li et al 2019 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 we therefore represent two types of farmers as follows the first type of farmer was associated with a low κ and high ν which indicates that this kind of farmer can quickly adjust their perceptions according to new observations but slowly reduce their confidence in the perceptions when the actual observations are not consistent with the perceptions this type of farmer is more confident and believes in their perception ability when dealing with uncertainties correspondingly the decisions made by this type of farmer are more adventurous thus we assign the first type of farmer with a high tolerance level a lower γ the second kind of farmer has behavioral characteristics that are opposite those of the first kind with high κ low ν and high γ with new observations these farmers are slow to adjust their perceptions accordingly but quick to reduce their confidence in the perception when faced with a mismatch between actual observations and perceptions this kind of farmer exhibits a low tolerance to uncertainties these two typical farmers were examined separately and contrastively the detailed factor settings are listed in table 3 2 3 5 scenario design module farmers may face various water management policies designed by water management authorities in the case study site the water permit quota and water price are the main policies that affect farmers agricultural activities therefore a scenario based analysis was conducted to test how farmers decision making can be affected by these policies when farmers have varied behavioral characteristics as farmers crop planting practices may be affected by many internal and external factors such as crop subsidy irrigation infrastructure labor and capital resources for crop planting and changes in climate thus in order to obtain a general understanding of the effect of the farmers behavioral characteristics on the response to different water management policies our scenario based analysis focused on the simulations of two representative types of farmers table 4 describes the five scenarios of this study the baseline scenario consisted of two simulations under same water management conditions each simulation assigned all the agents with same type of farmers type i or type ii all of other scenarios were conducted in the same way and compared with the baseline scenario scenario 1 increased the irrigation efficiency from 60 to 80 which may be caused by technology innovation scenarios 2 and 3 varied the available water amount increasing or decreasing by 20 respectively the water price in scenario 4 was set to 0 4 yuan m3 doubling the current water price of 0 2 yuan m3 to evaluate the effects of water price changes on crop choices and explore the rationality of the current water pricing strategies scenario 5 was a combination of scenarios 1 and 3 which aimed to decrease agricultural water use 3 results we run the abm with historical data in the study area from 2005 to 2015 at an annual scale the first 5 years is used to formulate farmers prior knowledge and the last 5 years is to generate the results that are presented in the following sections section 3 1 shows the effect of behavioral characteristics on the farmers crop choice section 3 2 presents the aggregated crop patterns crop profits and water use from the agent level to the county level and the entire study area level section 3 3 assesses the responses of the two types of farmers to different water management policies 3 1 effects of behavioral characteristics on farmers crop choices the results show that farmers perception to future crop prices and precipitation can be affected by their behavior parameters fig 3 low κ values make the predicted mean values of type i farmers more sensitive to the new observations and yearly variations in variables e g precipitation crop price which expresses the quick adjustment of their perceptions conversely type ii farmers with high κ values are more attached to their past cognitions and are less affected by recent observations which show the slow adjustment of their perceptions moreover with a low ν type ii farmers exhibit a larger and clearer change in predicted variance especially for the maize price because of the mismatch between observations and predictions for all agents the available land to grow crops is the sum of maize and wheat areas each agent determines the final planted areas of the two crops through the agent based two stage optimization model the results illustrate that type i farmers prefer maize to wheat in comparison with type ii farmers fig 4 thus type i farmers will plant maize and satisfy the needs of maize irrigation prior to satisfying the needs of wheat irrigation and vice versa for type ii farmers as such with a low γ type i farmers choose to plant as much maize as possible however under the constraint of water amount type i farmers cannot plant all available land due to the higher water consumption of maize than wheat type ii farmers tried to plant all available land even in large districts to reduce the risks under the effects of the uncertainties raised from their perceptions almost all the irrigation districts exhibit the maize dominated single crop pattern except for anyang and huazhaizi in ganzhou county that are dominated by wheat for most of the districts the observed proportions of wheat and maize were located in the middle of those of two types of simulations except for some large districts e g yingke in ganzhou county liyuanhe in linze county and youlian in gaotai county especially for the last two years 3 2 crop pattern crop profits and water use at the entire study area and county level to obtain a more general result and explore the complex emergent phenomena at a macrolevel we aggregated the results for the entire study area ganzhou county linze county and gaotai county as government management and policy implementation were mainly based on administrative boundaries the modeling results show the different crop choices among these regions fig 5 as the crop choices are affected by a number of different factors including location available cultivation area available water amount crop water demand and crop price for example for the entire study area the dominant crop is maize with a small area of wheat throughout the observation period while for the type i farmer the choice of wheat appears in 2013 and the area increases in the following years with the amount of maize area always high for type ii farmers wheat became the dominant crop in 2012 when the area of maize decreased significantly however for each county the phenomena are different the observations and type ii farmers show similar trends throughout the study area for type i farmers the choice of wheat in linze and gaotai appeared in 2014 and increased with the decrease in maize area taking 50 as the threshold for type i farmers the entire area and ganzhou were both above 50 for the whole period and linze fell below 50 in 2015 while gaotai fell below this threshold in 2014 the crop profits and water use of the two types of farmers are also determined through optimization as illustrated in fig 6 according to the annual water resource management reports the amount of observed water use is equal to irrigation water quota which is a hard constraint that cannot be violated due to the local policy called the most stringent water management system we use a ratio of simulated water use to observed water use to represent the water use of the two types of farmers the result shows that when farmers are type i they intend to use more water almost all of the water resource is used for both the entire study area and three counties however for type ii farmers the situations are totally different the water use ratio is much higher in ganzhou than in the other two counties in which the water use ratio was as low as approximately 85 regarding profits type i farmers have large profits along with large fluctuations while type ii farmers have low but relatively stable profits specific to each county the crop profit in gaotai is more stable than that in the other two counties and linze exhibits substantial decreases in crop profit 3 3 responses to different water management policies taking the basic simulation described above as the baseline five other water management policies were tested individually and conjunctively within the 5 year period to assess the responses of different types of farmers three outputs crop pattern total income and total water consumption were generated the crop patterns corresponding to the entire study area and each county under different scenarios are shown in fig 7 the total income and water consumption over the 5 year horizon are illustrated in fig 8 scenario 1 increases the irrigation efficiency from 60 to 80 over the period under this scenario the cultivation area of maize increases with type i farmers for all counties especially for the last two years and the area of maize increases as the area of wheat decreases which is different from the baseline scenario the overall cultivation area increased in the first four years and decreased in the last year except in linze county in 2014 however with type ii farmers the increases mainly occurred in the cultivation area of wheat and the overall cultivation area showed an increasing trend over all periods for all regions for the total profits and water consumption both types of farmers exhibited an increase in economic terms while type i farmers exhibited a larger increase than type ii farmers with the increase in irrigation efficiency water is saved for type ii farmers while no change is observed for type i farmers scenarios 2 and 3 consist of a pair of comparative scenarios the available water amount changes in these two scenarios consequently the overall cultivation area changes along with the increase or decrease in the water amount under these scenarios the crop structure is similar to that in the baseline nonetheless type i farmers prefer to expand the area of maize as the water amount increases and decrease the area of wheat as the water amount decreases and vice versa for type ii farmers thus the profits also change due to the change in crop areas with a larger variation for type i farmers than for type ii farmers in scenario 2 the water use is in accordance with the baseline but due to the decline in the available water amount in scenario 3 both farmers choose to use all of the water resources in scenario 4 the water price is doubled from 0 2 to 0 4 however there are no obvious changes in the crop choice and water use amounts compared with those in the baseline scenario however the profits decline because of the increase in the cost of water scenario 5 is a combination of scenario 1 and scenario 3 which increases the irrigation efficiency and decreases the available water amount inherited from scenario 1 the crop choice crop profits water use and their changes were almost the same as those in scenario 1 but the fluctuation was smaller than that in scenario 1 due to the decline in water amount 4 discussion this research tests a hypothesis that different behavioral characteristics will result in different crop choices to explore the mechanism we present an abm adopting the bayesian learning method and optimization method to model two typical behavior characteristics i e perception and tolerance with three behavioral factors e g κ ν γ with the abm farmers crop choices crop profits and water use are further studied for type i farmers with low κ and high ν values the decisions are riskier than those made by type ii farmers as their perceptions are more influenced by recent observations and they have greater confidence as such the predicted mean values for type i farmers exhibit larger fluctuations than those predicted for type ii farmers but the predicted variances have smaller variations with a small γ value this type of farmer prefers high profit crops e g maize although high profit crops often exhibit larger variance than other crops for type ii farmers their decisions are more cautious as they place more weight on historical experience resulting in small fluctuations in the predicted mean values but large variations in predicted variances with a large γ value this type of farmer prefers stable profit crops e g wheat because this type of crop often has a low variance in crop profits farmers crop pattern profits and water use are obtained by the two stage optimization approach the results reflect the disparity between the two types of farmers type i farmers pursue high profits to achieve this goal they choose to use all water to plant high profit crops which is more likely to result in a single crop pattern in contrast type ii farmers try to minimize the variance in crop profits therefore they choose to plant large cultivation areas and a mixed crop pattern resulting in comparably low profits as for the observations in most of the irrigation districts the crop pattern exhibits a single and maize dominated trend which is similar to the type i farmers nevertheless there are some irrigation districts that plant wheat in anyang and huazhaizi similar to type ii farmers these districts are located near the mountain and surrounded by desert our modeling results show that local farmers mainly pursue high economic profits when planting crops which is consistent with the conclusion of xiao et al 2019 however when crop growth conditions are not ideal farmers will place stable economic profits in the first place perhaps it can be inferred that the behavioral characteristics of local farmers tend more toward adventure than caution but these two types of farmers both exist in the study region for the last two years the mixed crop pattern appears in both types of farmers although the objectives are different these phenomena indicate that there may be other factors influencing farmers crop choices e g crop subsidy irrigation infrastructure and climate change andrée et al 2017 carr et al 2011 malanson et al 2014 paulrud and laitila 2010 seo and mendelsohn 2008 further work to explore and incorporate these factors is useful to provide a clear understanding of farmers crop choices to assess the response of different types of farmers to different water management policies five scenarios were assessed and compared with the baseline the responses were different which have been described in section 3 3 in addition to being caused by different behavior characteristics of farmers the differences were also caused by the different polices generally the amount of available water is an important factor the change in available water can result in changes in crop choices crop profits and water use the increase in irrigation efficiency indirectly increases the amount of available water however the extra water is not saved as the available cultivation land did not reach the maximum area though the profits increased which might be different from the aim of the policy e g saving water although water cost is the main portion of crop production costs the increase in water price does not result in the decline in water consumption as the water cost is relatively low compared with crop profits the current water pricing strategy is worth further study to explore how the setting of water prices can control water consumption furthermore the performances of these water policies in each region are also different even for the same types of farmers which means that the water policies should also take the specific characteristics of each region into consideration in view of the behavior characteristics of the two types of farmers additional efforts should further be employed to achieve the balance and sustainability between economic ecological and environmental aspects despite the policies described above for example type i farmers often have high crop profits and use a large amount of water and controlling available water seems to be an effective way to reduce water consumption which is not suitable for type ii farmers as they often utilize limited water other aspects of efforts such as social aspects and good education may help them manage uncertainties during the perception process and the marketing mechanism of water rights transactions may also be a rational method to increase farmer profit and water use efficiency deng et al 2017 du et al 2017a moreover some other factors e g crop subsidies technology innovation can also have influences and further consideration and incorporation should be taken in future works furthermore it is worthy to note that farmers decision making might change over time under changing environment there have been some studies showing that farmers decision making can be affected by various internal and external drivers these include but are not limited to farmers cognitive capabilities to process information the influence of neighboring farmers behaviors available labor and capital resources for crop planting government subsidies and attitudes towards uncertainties in future crop price and water availability andriyas and mckee 2014 arbuckle et al 2015 cai et al 2017 campbell et al 2011 kaine et al 2017 mialhe et al 2012 wilson et al 2018 the underlying mechanisms that drive farmers behavioral change are quite complex and may vary from region to region from farmer to farmer and from year to year andriyas and mckee 2014 future work can extend the scope of the current study by collecting farmer level disaggregated data to explore the key drivers that can trigger farmers behavioral change in the study area 5 conclusion and future work this work examined the effects of farmers behavioral characteristics on their crop choices and related crop patterns crop profits and water use under different water management policies in the hrb an abm was developed that incorporated two types of farmers behavioral characteristics namely perception and tolerance to explore decision making process of farmers our results show that different kinds of behavioral characteristics i e adventurous or cautious in perception and high or low in tolerance have a significant influence on farmers crop choices resulting in unique crop patterns crop profits and water use in addition different responses to water management policies were also observed which indicates the influence of farmers behavioral characteristics on the performance of water management policies moreover the results from the agent level to the entire study area level showed that the effect of behavioral characteristics varied across location and scale these findings reveal the importance of understanding the roles of farmers behavioral characteristics in farmers crop choices and water use decisions and can provide policymakers with novel insight for designing effective location based water management policies for agricultural water resource management in the hrb and many other endorheic basins worldwide however this work still has some limitations that need to be addressed in our future work first in addition to the two behavioral characteristics discussed in this study other factors may also influence farmers decision making such as path dependence climate change and their social network du et al 2017b malanson et al 2014 seo and mendelsohn 2008 future work needs to incorporate these factors in the modeling framework to better represent farmers decision making in the real world second in this study farmers behavioral parameters were used as external variables the values of the behavioral parameters were determined based on sensitivity analysis some previous studies have used empirical data interviews and role playing methods to retrieve parameters barendrecht et al 2019 janssen and ostrom 2006 kandiah et al 2017 tian et al 2016 future work can follow these studies to quantify farmers behavioral parameters in the study site third despite the water policies mentioned in this study more policies rules from social and economic aspects e g uncertainty control education crop subsidies water transactions should be considered in the future model to formulate more targeted water management policies in summary it is worthwhile to conduct

10200,understanding farmers decision making on crop choices and water use is essential for agricultural water resource management however previous studies have limited understanding of how farmers behavioral characteristics affect their crop choices and water use in agricultural systems to fill this research gap in this study we develop an agent based model abm that incorporates two types of behavioral characteristics i e perception to the uncertainty in future crop prices planting cost and precipitation and tolerance to the variation of crop profits to investigate their effects on crop choices and water use under the influence of water management policies the abm is applied to the heihe river basin hrb an arid endorheic river basin in northwestern china as a demonstration the modeling results show that farmers with adventurous perceptions and high tolerance level type i tend to choose high profit crops they are more likely to have a single crop pattern with high crop profits and high water consumption in comparison farmers with cautious perceptions and low tolerance level type ii prefer steady profit crops they typically pay more attention to the variation of crop profits resulting in a mixed crop pattern with low crop profits and low water consumption in addition the two types of farmers exhibit varied responses to water management policies the type i farmers are more sensitive to the changes in the volume of water permits and irrigation efficiency and as a result are more sensitive to the changes of water management policies than the type ii farmers do we also find that the effects of farmers behavioral characteristics vary at the irrigation district level county level and entire study area level these findings emphasize the importance of incorporating farmers behavioral characteristics into crop choice and water use models the modeling result could provide policy implications for designing location based water management policies that account for the heterogeneity in farmers behavioral characteristics and responses to water policies keywords agent based model agricultural water management crop choice endorheic basin heihe river basin 1 introduction water is an essential natural resource for social economic and environmental development oki and kanae 2006 however with the rapidly growing human population changing climate conditions and intensifying anthropogenic activities water scarcity has become a severe issue globally dietz et al 2003 harmancioglu 2017 by 2025 1 8 billion people are estimated to face water scarcity wwap 2014 among multiple water use sectors agriculture is the largest water consumer accounting for approximately 70 of the total freshwater consumption fao 2008 maeda et al 2011 sauer et al 2010 zhang and vesselinov 2017 in endorheic basins this proportion is even higher than 70 li et al 2017 which emphasizes the importance of effective water resource management in these river basins most of the endorheic basins are located in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2018a 2018b crop production is highly dependent on irrigation due to the limited water supply from precipitation tanji and kielen 2002 in some regions irrigation accounts for more than 90 of the total freshwater consumption li et al 2017 thus many endorheic basins have suffered from a variety of environmental and ecological problems such as groundwater decline downstream cutoﬀ lake shrinkage land degradation storms and other disasters huang et al 2017 li et al 2018a 2018b lu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 therefore it is important to establish effective agricultural water resource management policies in these regions to achieve a balance among the economy ecology and environment farmers crop choices have a great influence on agricultural water use it is important to understand farmers crop choices to manage agricultural water use several studies have been conducted for this purpose by simulating farmers crop choices the optimization approach is one of the main strategies considered by researchers ghasemi et al 2016 montazar et al 2010 many of these studies took farmers as rational agents and determined their crop choices by optimizing objective functions according to physical and economic constraints aljanabi et al 2018 das et al 2015 davidsen et al 2015 however these studies are limited as growing evidence from empirical studies has demonstrated that farmers are boundedly rational farmers behavioral characteristics such as their perception and tolerance to future uncertainties also play important roles in crop choice decision making artikov et al 2006 dury et al 2013 van duinen et al 2015 2016 therefore it is necessary to incorporate these behavioral characteristics to investigate farmers crop choices in recent years agent based model abm have been widely used to analyze complex systems such as water resource systems akhbari and grigg 2013 2015 ng et al 2011 yang et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 unlike the traditional top down approach abms employ a bottom up perspective the main cores of abms are autonomous agents which are embedded with a set of heterogeneous characteristics behavioral rules and the surrounding environment an 2012 an et al 2014 the emergence at the top level can be predicted by simulating the decision making of agents at the bottom level previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of applying abms for understanding complicated issues in water resource systems including water quality management ng et al 2011 groundwater management castilla rho et al 2015 mulligan et al 2014 noël and cai 2017 and domestic water management galán et al 2009 mashhadi ali et al 2017 because abms can explicitly exhibit the factors influencing the decision making process for example ng et al 2011 formulated an abm using a combination of behavioral factors to explore the best management practices bmps in agricultural systems with biofuel development and a water quality market du et al 2017a incorporated farmers behavioral parameters in an abm to investigate the influence of these parameters on the agricultural water market and crop production these studies demonstrated the feasibility of using abms to present farmers behavioral characteristics through behavioral factors and further explore the farmers decision making process in this study we focus on modeling farmers crop choices and water use decisions in the agricultural system of the heihe river basin hrb the second largest endorheic basin in northwestern china the hrb covers an area of approximately 1 4 105 km2 li et al 2018a 2018b the artificial oasis in the middle reach is a traditional grain production base in the arid area of china with maize for seed and wheat for grain as the two main crops deng et al 2017 liu et al 2016 the middle reach oasis provides seeds for nearly 40 of the corn in china with limited precipitation 140 mm year crop production in the hrb highly relies on artificial irrigation accounting for more than 93 of the water resource consumption in the basin wang et al 2015 in recent years the basin has experienced a noticeable shift between two major crops i e maize and wheat maize is more economically profitable than wheat but demands more water as more farmers have planted maize in the hrb water consumption has increased dramatically understanding the mechanisms behind farmers crop choices can help with designing effective water management policies for agricultural water resource management in the hrb and many other regions following the previous work by ng et al 2011 and hu et al 2015 in this study we built an abm to simulate farmers crop choices under the influence of two behavioral characteristics namely perception to future crop prices planting costs and precipitation and tolerance to profit variations we apply the model to the zhangye district in the middle reach of the hrb to understand how these behavioral parameters affect farmers decision making related to two crops i e maize and wheat and their responses to water management policies with the modeling framework we aim to answer the following questions 1 how will farmers behavior characteristics affect their crop choices 2 how will farmers crop choices affect the crop pattern crop profits and water use and 3 how will farmers behavioral characteristics affect the performances of water management policies the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area as well as the data sources and explains the model structure and details of our abm section 3 presents the results of applying the model to the hrb section 4 discusses the implications of these results conclusions limitations and future work are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hrb is located in the arid area of northwestern china covering qinghai province gansu province and inner mongolia the area of the basin is approximately 1 4 105 km2 the heihe river which is the major river in the watershed originates from the qilian mountains flows through yingluo valley then northward into the middle reach which is an artificial oasis called the zhangye district and finally flows out at zhengyi valley into two terminal lakes in the gobi desert li et al 2018a 2018b lu et al 2015 the study site is located in the zhangye district in the middle reach of the hrb fig 1 the zhangye district has a total area of 1 07 104 km2 consisting of ganzhou district linze county and gaotai county of zhangye city this region is the most developed agricultural area in the hrb accounting for 95 of the total cultivation land more than 90 of the total water consumption in the hrb is used for agricultural production there are 17 irrigation districts 6 of which are in ganzhou district 6 in linze county and the other 5 in gaotai county most of the large irrigation districts are in ganzhou district the elevation ranges from 1300 to 3600 m and 94 of the area is lower than 2000 m the mean annual precipitation is approximately 140 mm while the annual evaporation reaches 1600 2400 mm the main crops are maize and wheat which are both planted annually the irrigation water of this region mainly comes from surface water and rainfall recently cropping systems have undergone intense transformation from maize to wheat 2 2 data sources data from multiple sources were collected at the study site including agronomic data economic data historical meteorological data and institutional data as shown in table 1 agronomic data were mainly obtained from previous work and field survey results li et al 2018a 2018b xiao et al 2018 the land cover data were derived from the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research hiwater land cover map of heihe river basin dataset from the cold and arid regions science data center at lanzhou li et al 2013 zhong et al 2014 2015 the dataset was obtained from hj 1 ccd remote sensing images with a high spatial resolution of 30 m and a period from 2011 to 2015 the data from may and june were used to extract the area of maize and wheat depending on the crop phenophase economic data e g historical crop prices and costs from 2005 to 2015 were obtained from the zhangye and china statistical yearbook and annual reports meteorological data were obtained from the two meteorological stations in the study region zhangye station and gaotai station the precipitation datasets used in this study were calculated as the average annual precipitation at the two stations from 2005 to 2015 lu et al 2015 institutional data such as the boundaries and locations of irrigation districts were obtained from hiwater irrigation water permit quota data for each irrigation district were extracted from the annual water resource management reports 2011 2015 published by the zhangye municipal bureau of water conservancy 2 3 model description in this study an abm was developed to investigate the effects of farmers behavioral characteristics regarding crop choices and their responses to different water policies the abm consists of 17 agents each agent represents an irrigation district in the study area the agents differ from each other in terms of available cultivation area and amount of water available two types of farmers and crops are considered in the abm there are five components in the abm gray boxes in fig 2 the bayesian learning module crop yield and profit module optimization module agent generation module and scenario design module which are detailed in the following sections 2 3 1 bayesian learning module a farmer s crop choices can be affected by many variables such as planting cost crop price and water availability these variables are typically subject to some uncertainty due to uncertain climate and social economic conditions in the future e g a few months later in the face of uncertainty a farmer may adopt different strategies when estimating these variables to make crop choice decisions some studies have applied the bayesian learning method to simulate how farmers predict future crop prices and precipitation based on historical crop prices and precipitation respectively an 2012 conley and udry 2010 gars and ward 2019 ma and shi 2015 in this study we followed these previous works and used the bayesian learning method to formulate farmers perceptions about a variable in the future e g crop price based on historical observations e g crop prices over the past several years we assumed that all variables were normally distributed x n μ σ 2 thus we estimated the mean μ and variance σ 2 based on past observations of the variable by eq 1 which is called the likelihood function 1 l μ σ 2 d p d μ σ 2 1 2 π n 2 σ 2 n 2 exp 1 2 σ 2 n i 1 n x t x 2 n x μ 2 where d x 1 x 2 x t t 1 2 n is a set of past observations x t indicates the observation at time t which is assumed to be independent and identically distributed x is the mean of d n is the number of d and μ and σ 2 are the mean and variance of the likelihood function respectively however each farmer has initial private knowledge of μ and σ 2 which is called prior knowledge and one farmer s prior knowledge may be different from another s knowledge to express the differences we used normal inverse chi squared n i χ 2 to define the farmers prior knowledge as shown by eq 2 murphy 2007 2 p μ σ 2 n i χ 2 μ 0 κ 0 ν 0 σ 0 2 n μ μ 0 σ 2 κ 0 χ 2 σ 2 ν 0 σ 0 2 where μ 0 is the prior mean and κ 0 indicates how strongly a farmer believes μ 0 is the true value of the mean similarly σ 0 2 is the prior variance and ν 0 indicates how strongly a farmer believes σ 0 2 is the true value of the variance through bayes theorem we can obtain the prediction of the variable called the posterior distribution eq 3 3 p μ σ 2 d n i χ 2 μ n κ n ν n σ n 2 μ n κ 0 μ 0 n x κ n κ n κ 0 n ν n ν 0 n σ n 2 1 ν n ν 0 σ 0 2 i x t x 2 n κ 0 κ 0 n μ 0 x where μ n σ n 2 is the posterior mean variance κ n indicates how strongly a farmer believes μ n is the posterior mean and ν n indicates how strongly a farmer believes σ n 2 is the posterior variance combining eqs 1 3 with bayes theorem we can deduce the posterior distribution of a variable as student t distribution as shown in eq 4 with which a farmer can predict the value of a variable 4 p x d t v n μ n 1 κ n σ n 2 κ n where parameters ν n μ n 1 κ n σ n 2 κ n represent the degrees of freedom the expectation and variance of a predicted variable respectively it can be seen that a farmer s perception can be affected by his individual behavioral parameters i e κ and ν with the bayesian learning module farmers can predict the mean and variance of crop prices planting costs and precipitation accordingly 2 3 2 crop yield and profit module this model consists of two parts one part is to calculate the crop yield based on the crop yield function and the other part is to calculate crop profit based on the calculated crop yield the crop yield function used in this study can be described as eq 5 palazzo 2009 5 y j y m j 1 1 i r j e t c j p e 1 β where y j and y m j are the crop yield and maximum crop yield without water stress for crop j j indicates maize or wheat kg mu i r j is the irrigation water depth for crop j m e t c j is the potential crop evapotranspiration of crop j m p e is effective rainfall during the crop growth season m and β is the irrigation efficiency whose original value is 60 then the crop profit is obtained through eq 6 6 π j n π j j 1 n a j c p j c c j y j w p i j where π is the total profit yuan π j is the profit of crop j yuan n is the number of crop types taken into account a j is the cultivation area of crop j mu c p j and c c j are the price and planting cost of crop j yuan mu respectively w p is the water price which is 0 2 yuan m3 in the study region in this study two main crops maize and wheat were evaluated table 2 the agronomic parameters associated with the two crops in the study site were obtained from previous literature and field surveys 2 3 3 optimization module we assume farmers are utility optimizers and will plant the most profitable crops on their farmlands in this study farmer s decision for crop planting is made at the annual time step which is consistent with crop planting schedule in our study site a two stage optimization approach was adopted here to simulate farmers decision making processes i e crop choice and irrigation scheduling which are described as follows at the first stage i e the planning stage farmers make plan on crop planting area for each type of crop when climate and market conditions e g precipitation crop price planting cost etc are unknown farmers use historical data to estimate these variables based on the bayesian learning model as described in eqs 3 and 4 uncertainties arise from farmers perceptions of these variables farmers attempt to balance the crop profits and risks associated with the uncertainties to mimic this decision making process a mean standard deviation type of utility is used as shown in eq 7 bannister et al 2016 pyle and turnovsky 1970 7 u π e π γ σ π where π is crop profit u π is farmers utility to be maximized in decision making processes e π and σ π are the expected value and standard deviation of crop profit and γ measures farmers tolerance to the fluctuations of crop profits farmers with a larger value of γ have lower tolerance level farmers objective function in crop planning stage is described by eq 8 8 maximize u π constraints j 1 n a j p a j 1 n a j p i p j t w a 0 i p j e t c p e 0 a j p a where a j p is the planned planting area for crop j mu a widely used unit to measure land area in china and 1 mu is around 667 m2 a is the total available cultivation area mu t w a is the total water amount derived from irrigation water permit datasets m3 and i p j is the planned irrigation depth m at this stage the planned planting area a j p is determined and passed to the second stage as the upper bound of the final planting area for crop j at the second stage the objective is to maximize crop profit based on the actual observed climate and market variables described in eqs 5 and 6 the decision variables at this stage are the final planted crop area and irrigation water depth for each crop the decision process at this stage can be formulated as eq 9 9 maximize π constraints j 1 n a j i j t w a 0 a j a j p 0 i j e t c p e where a j is the final planting area for crop j which is between 0 and the planned planting area a j p determined at first stage note that there will be some areas growing no crop if actual climate and market conditions are not perfectly ideal for crop growth i j is the irrigation water depth for crop j after the two stage optimization the planting area and total amount of water for each crop are determined and the total crop profit can be calculated by eqs 5 and 6 accordingly 2 3 4 agent generation module at the initial phase of the abm this model was used to create agents with two behavioral characteristics perception and tolerance through three factors i e κ ν and γ derived from the bayesian learning model and optimization model this study modeled two types of farmers i e adventurous versus conservative based on theoretical behavioral theories as well as our empirical engagements with local farmers in the study area existing studies have widely applied the two representative behaviors to modeling farmers decision making in agricultural systems flaten et al 2005 he et al 2018 migliore et al 2015 sulewski and kłoczko gajewska 2014 these studies have shown that the two types of behaviors can well mimic a wide range of farmers agricultural practices in the real world moreover through interviews with local famers and literature surveys it is evidenced that local farmers empirical behaviors in the face of various water management policies hydrological and market conditions agree with the theoretical farmer behaviors reported in the literature li et al 2019 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 we therefore represent two types of farmers as follows the first type of farmer was associated with a low κ and high ν which indicates that this kind of farmer can quickly adjust their perceptions according to new observations but slowly reduce their confidence in the perceptions when the actual observations are not consistent with the perceptions this type of farmer is more confident and believes in their perception ability when dealing with uncertainties correspondingly the decisions made by this type of farmer are more adventurous thus we assign the first type of farmer with a high tolerance level a lower γ the second kind of farmer has behavioral characteristics that are opposite those of the first kind with high κ low ν and high γ with new observations these farmers are slow to adjust their perceptions accordingly but quick to reduce their confidence in the perception when faced with a mismatch between actual observations and perceptions this kind of farmer exhibits a low tolerance to uncertainties these two typical farmers were examined separately and contrastively the detailed factor settings are listed in table 3 2 3 5 scenario design module farmers may face various water management policies designed by water management authorities in the case study site the water permit quota and water price are the main policies that affect farmers agricultural activities therefore a scenario based analysis was conducted to test how farmers decision making can be affected by these policies when farmers have varied behavioral characteristics as farmers crop planting practices may be affected by many internal and external factors such as crop subsidy irrigation infrastructure labor and capital resources for crop planting and changes in climate thus in order to obtain a general understanding of the effect of the farmers behavioral characteristics on the response to different water management policies our scenario based analysis focused on the simulations of two representative types of farmers table 4 describes the five scenarios of this study the baseline scenario consisted of two simulations under same water management conditions each simulation assigned all the agents with same type of farmers type i or type ii all of other scenarios were conducted in the same way and compared with the baseline scenario scenario 1 increased the irrigation efficiency from 60 to 80 which may be caused by technology innovation scenarios 2 and 3 varied the available water amount increasing or decreasing by 20 respectively the water price in scenario 4 was set to 0 4 yuan m3 doubling the current water price of 0 2 yuan m3 to evaluate the effects of water price changes on crop choices and explore the rationality of the current water pricing strategies scenario 5 was a combination of scenarios 1 and 3 which aimed to decrease agricultural water use 3 results we run the abm with historical data in the study area from 2005 to 2015 at an annual scale the first 5 years is used to formulate farmers prior knowledge and the last 5 years is to generate the results that are presented in the following sections section 3 1 shows the effect of behavioral characteristics on the farmers crop choice section 3 2 presents the aggregated crop patterns crop profits and water use from the agent level to the county level and the entire study area level section 3 3 assesses the responses of the two types of farmers to different water management policies 3 1 effects of behavioral characteristics on farmers crop choices the results show that farmers perception to future crop prices and precipitation can be affected by their behavior parameters fig 3 low κ values make the predicted mean values of type i farmers more sensitive to the new observations and yearly variations in variables e g precipitation crop price which expresses the quick adjustment of their perceptions conversely type ii farmers with high κ values are more attached to their past cognitions and are less affected by recent observations which show the slow adjustment of their perceptions moreover with a low ν type ii farmers exhibit a larger and clearer change in predicted variance especially for the maize price because of the mismatch between observations and predictions for all agents the available land to grow crops is the sum of maize and wheat areas each agent determines the final planted areas of the two crops through the agent based two stage optimization model the results illustrate that type i farmers prefer maize to wheat in comparison with type ii farmers fig 4 thus type i farmers will plant maize and satisfy the needs of maize irrigation prior to satisfying the needs of wheat irrigation and vice versa for type ii farmers as such with a low γ type i farmers choose to plant as much maize as possible however under the constraint of water amount type i farmers cannot plant all available land due to the higher water consumption of maize than wheat type ii farmers tried to plant all available land even in large districts to reduce the risks under the effects of the uncertainties raised from their perceptions almost all the irrigation districts exhibit the maize dominated single crop pattern except for anyang and huazhaizi in ganzhou county that are dominated by wheat for most of the districts the observed proportions of wheat and maize were located in the middle of those of two types of simulations except for some large districts e g yingke in ganzhou county liyuanhe in linze county and youlian in gaotai county especially for the last two years 3 2 crop pattern crop profits and water use at the entire study area and county level to obtain a more general result and explore the complex emergent phenomena at a macrolevel we aggregated the results for the entire study area ganzhou county linze county and gaotai county as government management and policy implementation were mainly based on administrative boundaries the modeling results show the different crop choices among these regions fig 5 as the crop choices are affected by a number of different factors including location available cultivation area available water amount crop water demand and crop price for example for the entire study area the dominant crop is maize with a small area of wheat throughout the observation period while for the type i farmer the choice of wheat appears in 2013 and the area increases in the following years with the amount of maize area always high for type ii farmers wheat became the dominant crop in 2012 when the area of maize decreased significantly however for each county the phenomena are different the observations and type ii farmers show similar trends throughout the study area for type i farmers the choice of wheat in linze and gaotai appeared in 2014 and increased with the decrease in maize area taking 50 as the threshold for type i farmers the entire area and ganzhou were both above 50 for the whole period and linze fell below 50 in 2015 while gaotai fell below this threshold in 2014 the crop profits and water use of the two types of farmers are also determined through optimization as illustrated in fig 6 according to the annual water resource management reports the amount of observed water use is equal to irrigation water quota which is a hard constraint that cannot be violated due to the local policy called the most stringent water management system we use a ratio of simulated water use to observed water use to represent the water use of the two types of farmers the result shows that when farmers are type i they intend to use more water almost all of the water resource is used for both the entire study area and three counties however for type ii farmers the situations are totally different the water use ratio is much higher in ganzhou than in the other two counties in which the water use ratio was as low as approximately 85 regarding profits type i farmers have large profits along with large fluctuations while type ii farmers have low but relatively stable profits specific to each county the crop profit in gaotai is more stable than that in the other two counties and linze exhibits substantial decreases in crop profit 3 3 responses to different water management policies taking the basic simulation described above as the baseline five other water management policies were tested individually and conjunctively within the 5 year period to assess the responses of different types of farmers three outputs crop pattern total income and total water consumption were generated the crop patterns corresponding to the entire study area and each county under different scenarios are shown in fig 7 the total income and water consumption over the 5 year horizon are illustrated in fig 8 scenario 1 increases the irrigation efficiency from 60 to 80 over the period under this scenario the cultivation area of maize increases with type i farmers for all counties especially for the last two years and the area of maize increases as the area of wheat decreases which is different from the baseline scenario the overall cultivation area increased in the first four years and decreased in the last year except in linze county in 2014 however with type ii farmers the increases mainly occurred in the cultivation area of wheat and the overall cultivation area showed an increasing trend over all periods for all regions for the total profits and water consumption both types of farmers exhibited an increase in economic terms while type i farmers exhibited a larger increase than type ii farmers with the increase in irrigation efficiency water is saved for type ii farmers while no change is observed for type i farmers scenarios 2 and 3 consist of a pair of comparative scenarios the available water amount changes in these two scenarios consequently the overall cultivation area changes along with the increase or decrease in the water amount under these scenarios the crop structure is similar to that in the baseline nonetheless type i farmers prefer to expand the area of maize as the water amount increases and decrease the area of wheat as the water amount decreases and vice versa for type ii farmers thus the profits also change due to the change in crop areas with a larger variation for type i farmers than for type ii farmers in scenario 2 the water use is in accordance with the baseline but due to the decline in the available water amount in scenario 3 both farmers choose to use all of the water resources in scenario 4 the water price is doubled from 0 2 to 0 4 however there are no obvious changes in the crop choice and water use amounts compared with those in the baseline scenario however the profits decline because of the increase in the cost of water scenario 5 is a combination of scenario 1 and scenario 3 which increases the irrigation efficiency and decreases the available water amount inherited from scenario 1 the crop choice crop profits water use and their changes were almost the same as those in scenario 1 but the fluctuation was smaller than that in scenario 1 due to the decline in water amount 4 discussion this research tests a hypothesis that different behavioral characteristics will result in different crop choices to explore the mechanism we present an abm adopting the bayesian learning method and optimization method to model two typical behavior characteristics i e perception and tolerance with three behavioral factors e g κ ν γ with the abm farmers crop choices crop profits and water use are further studied for type i farmers with low κ and high ν values the decisions are riskier than those made by type ii farmers as their perceptions are more influenced by recent observations and they have greater confidence as such the predicted mean values for type i farmers exhibit larger fluctuations than those predicted for type ii farmers but the predicted variances have smaller variations with a small γ value this type of farmer prefers high profit crops e g maize although high profit crops often exhibit larger variance than other crops for type ii farmers their decisions are more cautious as they place more weight on historical experience resulting in small fluctuations in the predicted mean values but large variations in predicted variances with a large γ value this type of farmer prefers stable profit crops e g wheat because this type of crop often has a low variance in crop profits farmers crop pattern profits and water use are obtained by the two stage optimization approach the results reflect the disparity between the two types of farmers type i farmers pursue high profits to achieve this goal they choose to use all water to plant high profit crops which is more likely to result in a single crop pattern in contrast type ii farmers try to minimize the variance in crop profits therefore they choose to plant large cultivation areas and a mixed crop pattern resulting in comparably low profits as for the observations in most of the irrigation districts the crop pattern exhibits a single and maize dominated trend which is similar to the type i farmers nevertheless there are some irrigation districts that plant wheat in anyang and huazhaizi similar to type ii farmers these districts are located near the mountain and surrounded by desert our modeling results show that local farmers mainly pursue high economic profits when planting crops which is consistent with the conclusion of xiao et al 2019 however when crop growth conditions are not ideal farmers will place stable economic profits in the first place perhaps it can be inferred that the behavioral characteristics of local farmers tend more toward adventure than caution but these two types of farmers both exist in the study region for the last two years the mixed crop pattern appears in both types of farmers although the objectives are different these phenomena indicate that there may be other factors influencing farmers crop choices e g crop subsidy irrigation infrastructure and climate change andrée et al 2017 carr et al 2011 malanson et al 2014 paulrud and laitila 2010 seo and mendelsohn 2008 further work to explore and incorporate these factors is useful to provide a clear understanding of farmers crop choices to assess the response of different types of farmers to different water management policies five scenarios were assessed and compared with the baseline the responses were different which have been described in section 3 3 in addition to being caused by different behavior characteristics of farmers the differences were also caused by the different polices generally the amount of available water is an important factor the change in available water can result in changes in crop choices crop profits and water use the increase in irrigation efficiency indirectly increases the amount of available water however the extra water is not saved as the available cultivation land did not reach the maximum area though the profits increased which might be different from the aim of the policy e g saving water although water cost is the main portion of crop production costs the increase in water price does not result in the decline in water consumption as the water cost is relatively low compared with crop profits the current water pricing strategy is worth further study to explore how the setting of water prices can control water consumption furthermore the performances of these water policies in each region are also different even for the same types of farmers which means that the water policies should also take the specific characteristics of each region into consideration in view of the behavior characteristics of the two types of farmers additional efforts should further be employed to achieve the balance and sustainability between economic ecological and environmental aspects despite the policies described above for example type i farmers often have high crop profits and use a large amount of water and controlling available water seems to be an effective way to reduce water consumption which is not suitable for type ii farmers as they often utilize limited water other aspects of efforts such as social aspects and good education may help them manage uncertainties during the perception process and the marketing mechanism of water rights transactions may also be a rational method to increase farmer profit and water use efficiency deng et al 2017 du et al 2017a moreover some other factors e g crop subsidies technology innovation can also have influences and further consideration and incorporation should be taken in future works furthermore it is worthy to note that farmers decision making might change over time under changing environment there have been some studies showing that farmers decision making can be affected by various internal and external drivers these include but are not limited to farmers cognitive capabilities to process information the influence of neighboring farmers behaviors available labor and capital resources for crop planting government subsidies and attitudes towards uncertainties in future crop price and water availability andriyas and mckee 2014 arbuckle et al 2015 cai et al 2017 campbell et al 2011 kaine et al 2017 mialhe et al 2012 wilson et al 2018 the underlying mechanisms that drive farmers behavioral change are quite complex and may vary from region to region from farmer to farmer and from year to year andriyas and mckee 2014 future work can extend the scope of the current study by collecting farmer level disaggregated data to explore the key drivers that can trigger farmers behavioral change in the study area 5 conclusion and future work this work examined the effects of farmers behavioral characteristics on their crop choices and related crop patterns crop profits and water use under different water management policies in the hrb an abm was developed that incorporated two types of farmers behavioral characteristics namely perception and tolerance to explore decision making process of farmers our results show that different kinds of behavioral characteristics i e adventurous or cautious in perception and high or low in tolerance have a significant influence on farmers crop choices resulting in unique crop patterns crop profits and water use in addition different responses to water management policies were also observed which indicates the influence of farmers behavioral characteristics on the performance of water management policies moreover the results from the agent level to the entire study area level showed that the effect of behavioral characteristics varied across location and scale these findings reveal the importance of understanding the roles of farmers behavioral characteristics in farmers crop choices and water use decisions and can provide policymakers with novel insight for designing effective location based water management policies for agricultural water resource management in the hrb and many other endorheic basins worldwide however this work still has some limitations that need to be addressed in our future work first in addition to the two behavioral characteristics discussed in this study other factors may also influence farmers decision making such as path dependence climate change and their social network du et al 2017b malanson et al 2014 seo and mendelsohn 2008 future work needs to incorporate these factors in the modeling framework to better represent farmers decision making in the real world second in this study farmers behavioral parameters were used as external variables the values of the behavioral parameters were determined based on sensitivity analysis some previous studies have used empirical data interviews and role playing methods to retrieve parameters barendrecht et al 2019 janssen and ostrom 2006 kandiah et al 2017 tian et al 2016 future work can follow these studies to quantify farmers behavioral parameters in the study site third despite the water policies mentioned in this study more policies rules from social and economic aspects e g uncertainty control education crop subsidies water transactions should be considered in the future model to formulate more targeted water management policies in summary it is worthwhile to conduct interdisciplinary work from natural economic social and psychological aspects to further understand the mechanisms driving farmers decision making and adaptation processes declaration of competing

10201,in this study the adaptation characteristics of orange trees related to the application over a decade of deficit irrigation di strategies have been explored to this purpose the analysis of a minimal dataset composed of physiological information stem water potential ψstem and sap flow sf measurements yield fruits number and weight and qualitative parameters titratable acidity ta and total soluble solids tss was performed with reference to the last irrigation seasons i e 2018 19 the applied irrigation treatments were the following sustained deficit irrigation sdi regulated deficit irrigation rdi partial root zone drying prd each distributing a water deficit of about 19 29 and 52 respectively compared to the control treatment fi supplying the full irrigation level 100 etc in general higher water use efficiencies wue have been obtained in di treatments which guarantee greater water savings up to 50 without affecting yield and quality characteristics in particular the most stressed treatment prd while reaching the lowest ψstem values 1 8 to 2 0mpa as also shown by sf versus ψstem clusters resulted in wue values for yield wuey ta wueta and tss wuetss parameters of approximately 2 6 2 9 and 3 1 times greater than fi respectively overall this study allowed identifying the cumulative adaptation characteristics of the orange trees under study to the application of long term di strategies and showing that trees were able to achieve yields and qualitative features similar to those obtained with fi even after 10 years of application of deficient irrigation regimes keywords sustainable citrus production semi arid climate orange groves water deficit 1 introduction nowadays irrigated agriculture has to cope with the increasingly limited availability of water resources which is becoming worrying especially in arid and semi arid areas due to climate change cc scenarios galindo et al 2018 indeed the intensification of drought events expected under the cc scenarios will contribute to the development of stress conditions for crops following the increase in the thermal gradient the reduction of precipitation with consequent negative effects on productivity fracasso et al 2020 in the mediterranean semi arid environment the success of citrus production largely depends on adequate irrigation rallo et al 2017 it is therefore essential to manage the available water resources in a sustainable way in order to optimise the productivity of the citrus groves while enhancing their adaptation to water shortage conditions in this perspective several studies have emphasised the importance of adopting localised irrigation techniques for citrus groves e g surface and sub surface drip irrigation in combination with innovative operating methods e g use of very low flow pressure drippers and the optimal management of irrigation water e g deficit irrigation di including partial root zone drying prd and regulated deficient irrigation rdi provenzano 2005 consoli et al 2017 vanella et al 2018 vanella and consoli 2018 it is known that di strategies such as rdi gasque et al 2016 garcía tejero et al 2010 consoli et al 2014 and prd marsal et al 2008 romero et al 2012 consoli et al 2017 permit to maintain or slightly reduce crop production features by applying a considerably lower amount of irrigation volume with the consequent increase of crop water use efficiency wue english 1990 consoli et al 2012 2014 garcía tejero et al 2011 ballester et al 2011 the adoption of the rdi technique requires a deep knowledge of the physiological crop response to water deficit conditions in order to identify the optimal phenological phase for the application of water restrictions in order to minimise the negative effects on crop yield and quality navarro et al 2010 2015 aguado et al 2012 pérez pérez et al 2009 in particular several studies have shown that the application of moderate water stress conditions on citrus fruits during the flowering and fruit set phases generally compromises the yield due to the increase in fruit fall doorenbos and kassam 1979 ginestar and castel 1996 romero et al 2006a pérez pérez et al 2008 on the other hand water restrictions applied during the last phase of fruit growth and ripening decrease yield by reducing fruit weight and size gonzález altozano and castel 1999 treeby et al 2007 pérez pérez et al 2009 garcía tejero et al 2010 while the period following fruit fall was less sensitive to water restrictions cohen and goell 1988 considering the prd strategy i e irrigation is alternatively applied to only one half of the root zone while the other half is kept dry blackman and davies 1985 several studies have shown that in the root system under drying soil biochemical signals are triggered by the roots to shoot causing physiological responses for plant adaptation such as stomatal conductance gs and plant transpiration reduction dry and loveys 2000 hutton and loveys 2011 mossad et al 2018 2020 gotur et al 2018 the main component of the biochemical signalling process involves the abscissic acid hormone aba also known as plant stress hormone prgomet et al 2020 chai et al 2016 in general higher aba concentrations in the roots and in the leaf tissues have been found during the application of severe di conditions romero conde et al 2014 puglisi et al 2019 and prolonged prd with the consequent increase in the root shoot ratio and greater wue pérez pérez et al 2018 leaf ψleaf and stem water potential ψstem are the most significant physiological indicators capable of monitoring and identifying plant water status taylor et al 2015 jamshidi et al 2020 specifically ψstem measurements are more sensitive to slight differences in plant water status than ψleaf as it is less affected by the evaporative demand and by leaf to leaf variations in stomatal opening and it is more representative of the tree water status than the ψ of an exposed leaf naor 2006 ortuño et al 2006 garcía orellana et al 2013 thus ψstem has become a valuable indicator for irrigation scheduling and has been used as a threshold for both conventional and di management girona et al 2006a 2006b however ψstem refers to a specific moment of the day requiring also frequent repetitions during the irrigation season for a proper crop monitoring ballester et al 2013 ortuño et al 2006 therefore alternative water stress indicators are required to overcome these limitations sap flow sf techniques allow indirectly measurements of plant water losses in particular automated sf systems permit to continuously monitor the transpiration activity of both well watered and deficit irrigated plants smith and allen 1996 goldhamer et al 1999 ortuño et al 2004a 2004b sf is related to external weather conditions such as vapour pressure deficit vpd kang et al 2003 gonzález altozano et al 2008 du et al 2008 dragoni et al 2009 köhler et al 2010 motisi et al 2012 soil water content swc and physiological parameters such as ψstem and gs liu et al 2009 ortuño et al 2010 di strategies in some cases reduce the fruit quality mougheith et al 1977 mainly influencing the qualitative parameters of citrus production such as total soluble solids and acidity chartzoulakis et al 1999 for example romero et al 2006b observed a dependency between the decrease in clementine fruit quality and the phenological stage in which di is applied other studies have shown that di conditions may lead to a greater number of smaller fruits treeby et al 2007 conversely peng and rabe 1998 concluded that in satsuma mandarin fruit size was not affected by water restrictions therefore variations in the fruit weight or diameter at any stage of development can depend on the species and change depending on the times and the water restriction imposed by the irrigation regimes although there is a large number of studies conducted in mediterranean semi arid climatic conditions analysing the effects of the adoption of di strategies on citrus ballester et al 2014 gasque et al 2016 gonzalez dugo et al 2018 is important to explore the physiological productive and qualitative adaptation characteristics that this type of crop can acquire after a long term di application table 1 reports a number of study cases evaluating the long term effects of di on citrus crops the main objective of the study was to evaluate the ability of citrus groves c sinensis l osbeck grown in typical semi arid climatic conditions to adapt to the application of moderate severe water deficit regimes after a decade since its plantation in 2010 in particular the cumulative adaption characteristics of the orange groves was assessed on a minimum set of physiological stem water potential ψstem and sap flow sf measurements and productive qualitative indicators considered significant for identifying the water status and water use efficiency features of the crops under study this purpose was achieved i by comparing the behaviour of di trees with those under fi strategies during two irrigation seasons i e 2018 19 and ii by evaluating whether deficit irrigated trees have changed their response over time 2 materials and methods 2 1

minitab inc state college pa usa 3 results 3 1 long term physiological responses of orange orchards to water deficit fig 2 shows the average ψstem values mpa measured at the irrigation treatments during 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons fi and rdi showed similar average ψstem values ranging from 1 36 to 1 62 mpa with the exception of doy 225 2018 when rdi presented significantly lower ψstem values than fi 1 46 and 1 57 mpa for fi and rdi respectively the differences between the two treatments in terms of ψstem are evident and when the rdi was supplied with 50 of etc rdi treatment was irrigated at full i e 100 of etc until doy 204 and doy 217 in 2018 and 2019 respectively sdi and prd evidenced more negative ψstem values than fi with values varying between 1 37 and 1 78 mpa in 2018 and between 1 56 and 2 04 mpa in 2019 fig 3 shows the different clusters obtained by plotting ψstem values and their corresponding hourly sf data note that the clusters present specific distributions mainly as function of the different sf rates due the different degree of water deficits applied in particular the sf ψstem cluster for fi is mainly located in the upper right part of fig 3 denoting higher sf rates from 0 141 to 0 165 mm h 1 with low water stress effects ψstem ranging from 1 3 to 1 6 mpa for sdi and rdi the sf ψstem clusters were distributed between similar ψstem values from 1 3 to 1 8 mpa and in prd the sf ψstem clusters were recognised between ψstem ranging from 1 6 to 1 8 mpa with few exceptions which presented ψstem values lower than 1 9 mpa however these di treatments presented different sf fluxes with rdi having the lowest values 0 076 0 087 mm h 1 followed by sdi 0 100 0 106 mm h 1 and prd 0 115 0 131 mm h 1 respectively 3 2 physiological adaptation to abiotic conditions fig 4 shows the relationship between vpd and sf observed during 2018 2019 at hourly daylight scale two different stages can be differentiated in the sf vpd relationship the first one corresponded with a linear increasing pattern for vpd values ranged between 0 and 2kpa at this stage fi presented a significant higher slope term 0 058 followed by prd 0 042 and sdi 0 037 respectively being rdi the treatment with the lowest slope term 0 035 fig 4 once this vpd threshold was exceeded i e 2kpa the relationship between vpd and sf tended to become more stable until reaching a certain point sfmax where vpd hardly influenced sf sfmax depended also on the irrigation treatment thus whereas sfmax was found approximately at 0 14 mm h 1 for fi di treatments obtained lower values being 0 11 0 09 and 0 07 mm h 1 for prd sdi and rdi respectively the relationship obtained during 2018 2019 between the hourly sf and tair values fig 5 followed almost linear patterns with r2 ranging from 0 58 rdi to 0 74 sdi as for the hourly sf and vpd relationship the sf and tair trends showed different magnitudes i e slope terms in relation to the adopted irrigation strategy in this sense fi presented the higher slope term 5 33e 03 followed by prd 4 06e 03 and sdi 3 46e 03 respectively being rdi the treatment with the lowest slope term 2 58e 03 similar correlation trends to those obtained at hourly scale for vpd and tair with sf were observed also at daily scale but with higher r2 values 0 68 0 74 vs 0 55 0 63 for sf vpd at daily and hourly scale respectively and 0 75 0 83 vs 0 58 0 74 for sf tair at daily and hourly scale respectively fig 6 specifically for daily mean sf vpd relationships fig 6a it can be observed that sfmax values were 1 4 1 1 0 9 and 0 8 for fi prd sdi and rdi respectively regarding the daily mean sf tair relationships fig 6b the slope terms followed the same relative pattern as at hourly scale fig 5 ranging from 0 05 for fi to 0 02 for rdi fig 7 shows the changes in swc observed in the upper soil layer 0 10 0 30 m during the 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons as expected all treatments had daily swc values ranged between the fc and the wp in particular all treatments were characterised by similar average daily swc conditions ranging between 0 22 for sdi and prd to 0 24 cm3 cm 3 for fi and rdi table 4 when comparing the swc trends of the different irrigation treatments it was evidenced that they differed in the amplitude of the drying and wetting cycles which were more pronounced in sdi and especially in prd treatment despite these differences a constant swc trend along the irrigation seasons were observed for all treatments 3 3 crop yield qualitative and wue features in 2019 total yield varied from 25 5 to 31 7 tha 1 and no significant differences were observed among the different irrigation treatments table 5 fruit weight number of fruits and ed also without differences among the irrigation treatments ranged from 249 to 280 g from 286 to 434 and from 77 to 79 mm respectively table 5 the yield parameters obtained in 2020 were similar to those obtained in 2019 table 5 specifically total yield ranged from 29 9 to 34 5 tha 1 fruit weight from 243 to 289 g number of fruit from 302 to 407 and ed from 78 to 82 mm the quality parameters i e ta gl 1 tss brix and mi referring to the 2019 and 2020 harvests 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons are reported in table 6 referring to ta similar values were obtained for both years varying between 1 1 and 1 3 g l 1 the same behaviour was observed for tss and mi with values ranging from 10 1 to 11 2 brix and from 8 6 to 9 8 for both harvest periods respectively additionally despite the different levels of water deficit applied no significant differences were observed in qualitative terms between the different irrigation treatments table 7 reports the wue obtained for the productive yield wuey and qualitative features ta wueta and tss wuetss at the different irrigation treatments during the 2019 and 2020 harvest periods 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons in particular in 2019 the wuey ranged from 8 2 to 17 7 kg m 3 whereas values obtained in 2020 were slightly higher varying from 10 0 to 21 2 kg m 3 when comparing the wuey values obtained for the different irrigation treatments significant differences were obtained between fi 8 2 and 10 0 kg m 3 for 2019 and 2020 respectively and prd 17 7 and 21 2 kg m 3 for 2019 and 2020 respectively regarding wueta the obtained values ranged from 47 7 to 120 7 g m 3 for 2019 and from 66 6 to 138 8 g m 3 in 2020 being wueta for prd significantly higher than those referring to the other irrigation treatments for the harvest periods finally wuetss ranged from 433 to 1047gm 3 in 2019 whereas higher values were obtained in 2020 varying from 601 to 1346 g m 3 as for wueta significant differences were found for wuetss between prd and the other irrigation treatments 4 discussion in this study the adaptation effects related to the adoption of di strategies applied over a decade in an orange orchard have been explored through the analysis of a dataset composed of physiological information i e including the main representative plant water status indicators and yield qualitative parameters with reference to two last irrigation seasons 2018 2019 which are influenced by a decade of application of di strategies the different amount of irrigation volumes supplied during the long term di application at the study site table 2 resulted mainly dependent on the year specific climatic conditions and on the progressive growth of the orange trees i e affecting the localised factor and the kc values previous studies conducted at the experimental site under study have intensively analysed the specific effects due to the application of different levels of water deficit conditions on different physiological parameters such as gs ψstem sf leaf photosynthesis and canopy temperature i e for the irrigation seasons 2011 12 in consoli et al 2014 for 2011 12 in stagno et al 2015 for 2013 14 in consoli et al 2017 for 2015 in puglisi et al 2019 for 2018 in pappalardo et al 2019 from these studies ψstem and sf were identified as physiological proxies due to their ability to detect the responses to water deficit among the irrigation treatments under study as shown in puglisi et al 2019 for orange orchards growing in mediterranean semi arid conditions the mean ψstem values for fi full irrigation showed a similar trend to rdi presenting almost constant values during the irrigation season both before and after the application of the water restriction fig 2 this decrease in ψstem differences over time between the di treatments specifically rdi and fi could be directly ascribed to the adaptation features developed by the crop following the long term di application since the influence of phenology and the crop size had a minimal effect on ψstem behaviour in fact ψstem measurements were carried out always during the same phenological stage from mid june to september and the main morphological parameters were quite constant during the last irrigation seasons table 3 and stable during the years because trees were commonly subjected to a minimal harvest a simple evaluation of the ψstem values observed after intense rain events has permitted to determine the ψstem behaviour under no water stress conditions at the study site in particular the ψstem value in fi after a rain event of 33 mm doy 217 2018 fig 7 was around 1 46 mpa focusing also during other rain events occurred during previous irrigation seasons similar ψstem values were reached as for instance in consoli et al 2014 with ψstem values of 1 4 to 1 5 mpa in fi after rain events of 8 and 13 mm on doys 224 and 247 2012 respectively similarly consoli et al 2017 found ψstem values of about 1 6 mpa after a rain event of 37 mm on doy 260 2013 finally after a rain event of 43 mm on doy 223 224 2015 puglisi et al 2019 ψstem values of 1 3 mpa were measured these findings support the hypothesis that fi properly corresponded with a close to non water stress conditions since ψstem values measured in fi during the study period were within this range of values the ψstem behaviour at fi condition is reflected in swc fig 7 being this treatment characterised by higher swc values than the other di treatments thus showing less resistance to root water uptake this was confirmed also by the sf observations figs 3 5 in comparison to fi sdi showed slightly more negative ψstem values according to the lower swc condition fig 7 other studies have shown a simultaneous reduction in ψstem and gs rates due to the swc deficit ballester et al 2013 garcía tejero et al 2011 gasque et al 2016 the lower swc condition observed at sdi in comparison to fi and rdi is probably due to a higher root density concentrated in the most upper part of the soil until 40 cm of depth where the sdi drip lines are located this hypothesis was supported by visual observations carried out on excavated pits that showed higher concentration of fine roots covering the buried drips in sdi than in fi and rdi soil profiles as expected the lowest ψstem values fig 2 were recorded in the most severe di treatment prd doy 214 and 231 in 2019 with values of 1 95 mpa and 2 04 mpa respectively figs 2 3 in which the swc reached the lowest values fig 7 however the general trend observed for swc always ranged between the wp and fc during the irrigation seasons at all treatments fig 7 demonstrating the suitability of the adoption of the fao 56 etc method for scheduling the irrigation in combination with the use of site specific adjusting parameters for taking into account the crop and soil characteristics this was also confirmed by no drainage patterns observed in the soil profile by electrical resistivity imaging technique vanella et al 2020 overall as shown in the sf ψstem clusters fig 3 crops were able to maintain a certain degree of water stress our results proof that over time the citrus grove has been adapted to water stress without affecting yield and quality characteristics tables 5 6 similar ψstem values have been observed by ballester et al 2014 and gasque et al 2016 who showed that ψstem values in citrus should not exceed 1 5 mpa and 2 0 mpa respectively in the mediterranean semi arid environment as for the ψstem the transpirative response was able to reflect the di conditions occurring at the study site as function of the different magnitude of the applied water deficit and the evaporative demand see the correlations between the sf and the climatic parameters vpd and tair figs 4 5 which coincides with the findings of saitta et al 2020 these results are in accordance with several researches showing a general decrease of the sf rates due to the application of di strategies espadafor et al 2017 lόpez lόpez et al 2018 roccuzzo et al 2014a b herein it is possible to note that the sf rates of the di treatments were lower than the sf fluxes observed in fi which depends on the level of accumulated water stress throughout the day and environmental demand a peculiar trend was observed in prd in which 50 of the irrigation volume of fi was applied that showed sf fluxes greater than the other di treatments sdi and rdi this is probably due to the prd operational mode that used alternating two dripper lines located at the eastern and western side of the trees this permits the root system to explore a larger soil volume and to have access to more water resources mingo et al 2004 that otherwise they would not be able to reach in this sense mary et al 2019 observed privileged direction of root development in prd with greater rooting extent in comparison to full rate conditions in addition according to chai et al 2016 the application of the prd strategy causes a compensatory effect on sf fluxes specifically the sf rate tends to increase when the roots have directly access to water wetted area whereas sf is reduced when the root system is in dry conditions dry area with poor access to water the alternation of the wet dry portions due to the prd strategy contributes to maintain as in our case higher sf rates in accordance to other studies e g kang et al 2003 gonzález altozano et al 2008 du et al 2008 dragoni et al 2009 köhler et al 2010 a close relationship between the sf fluxes and the weather factors was observed such as vpd and tair however a great variability of the sf rates for any vpd was observed mainly due to the stomatal adjustment as shown in figs 4 5 in particular it can be noted that fi is characterised by higher sf vpd and sf tair positive trends than the di treatments sdi rdi and prd this behaviour is mainly due to the applied di conditions that for tair and vpd increasing may lead to stomatal closure and therefore to sf rates reduction consoli et al 2014 stomatal closure in response to the vpd increases could be an effective strategy to avoid excessive water loss in drought conditions and prevent that the ψstem falls to dangerous water stress levels tyree and sperry 1988 granier et al 2000 fig 3 from the crop productivity point of view previous studies carried at the same experimental orchard have shown statistically significant differences among the different di treatments and fi consoli et al 2014 2017 mainly showing slighter fruit weight for the di trees for the last two irrigation seasons under study the productive features i e yield parameters fruit weight number of fruits and ed did not show significant differences among the irrigation treatments as also reported in puglisi et al 2019 this could indicate that plants have adapted over time to these stresses eliminating the differences in terms of production compared to the fi these evidences are also confirmed by the similar morphological characteristics obtained among the treatments under study table 3 similar results were obtained by garcía tejero et al 2011 and aguado et al 2012 who showed that the di application conditions did not influence the final yield for citrus in comparison to the well irrigated conditions however adu et al 2018 argued that yield response under water saving irrigation strategies is context specific and mainly depends on crop species and soil texture water productivity has become a key requirement in sustainable crop production and environmental management adu et al 2019 the applied water deficit in fruit crops has been associated with wue increasing not only in terms of wuey garcía tejero et al 2010 carr 2012 but also considering wuetss and wueta in general the effects of di strategies on the fruits qualitative characteristics have been studied in a wide range of crop types including olives wahbi et al 2005 grapes salon et al 2004 and various citrus varieties such as valencian orange castel and buj 1990 lemon sánchez blanco et al 1989 mandarin peng and rabe 1998 within the qualitative aspects tss and ta contents increases represent a consolidated response to water deficit in citrus fruits even if the water deficit is applied during the whole season or during fruit growth stages hutton et al 2007 hutton and loveys 2011 garcía tejero et al 2010 a meta analysis on the effects of fi and di on quality attributes conducted by adu et al 2019 reported that di strategies reached higher improvements than fi when considering improvement in tss without significantly altering ta or ph of fruits the increase of tss and ta in response to water deficit is a very well established response in citrus fruits particularly when the water deficit is imposed during the whole season hutton and loveys 2011 or during some fruit growth phases hutton et al 2007 garcía tejero et al 2010 for example in studies conducted by hutton and loveys 2011 on navel orange the concentrations of tss and acid g of citric acid 100 ml of juice were higher in trees treated with prd with values respectively of 13 9 and 1 59 compared to normally irrigated trees whose values were respectively 13 5 and 1 42 conversely to previous studies conducted in the same orchard where the tss values for sdi rdi and prd were respectively 1 02 1 11 and 1 10 times higher than the fi treatment consoli et al 2014 2017 and according to studies conducted by other authors ballester et al 2014 garcía tejero et al 2010 yakushiji et al 1996 mossad et al 2020 which found a significant increase of tss and ta in the context of di strategies in this study no statistically significant differences were observed between di and fi treatments in terms of quality parameters this evidences the adaptation effects of the citrus orchard under study due to the application of the long term di strategies the mitigation of the differences in crop quality and production features among the di treatments and the control over the years can be interpreted as an adaptation measure adopted by the plants for facing the water deficit conditions for increasing stress tolerance including molecular mechanisms and concomitant growth adjustment osakabe et al 2014 these latter include stomatal responses ion transport activation of stress signalling pathways i e aba puglisi et al 2019 and response to reduce photosynthetic activity this adaptation effect is also interpreted in wue terms table 7 which shows higher values for di treatments sdi rdi and prd and increases over time with higher wue values for 2019 compared to 2018 this increase over time is evident by comparing the wue values of each irrigation treatment for the study years 2018 2019 with the lower values reported in consoli et al 2014 2017 for the same experimental site in particular prd in which the most severe water restriction was imposed showed the highest wue values highlighting the advantages of the prd adoption for obtaining significant water savings up to 50 this result is in accordance to most of the studies carried out on prd strategies in the context of fruit trees that have experienced higher wue values in di conditions being the applied irrigation volumes the critical component for the wue increasing santos et al 2005 spreer et al 2009 in addition the application of the prd in areas with reduced water availability is useful not only to guarantee water savings improve the use of nutrients and increase maintain yield but also for the production of foods with better characteristics nutritional and health jovanovic and stikic 2018 finally the results of this study contribute to describe the effects on crop characteristics due to the long term di conditions highlighting the success of the applications of the di strategies in terms of yield quality and water savings for citrus crops in mediterranean semi arid environments where water resources are limited such as in sicily 5 conclusion the main conclusion that can be drawn from this study are reported as follows the long term di strategies can be successfully applied to high value cropping systems like orange orchards in semi arid climatic conditions overall from the observed sf ψstem clusters crops were able to maintain a certain degree of water stress without causing negative effects on the yield and fruit quality the di treatments have modified the relationships that link the sf vdp and sf tair showing lower trends compared to the fully irrigated treatment the application of the di strategies allowed water savings up to 53 for the prd treatment with consequent increases in the wue without compromising yield and fruit main quality parameters ta and tss the present study suggests the usefulness of starting the application of di to young citrus plants from the beginning of their transplantation in the open field in order to favour the progressive adaptation of the crop to the imposed water regimes this long term study sets the basis for the transfer of research knowledge about di application to the real citrus context

10201,in this study the adaptation characteristics of orange trees related to the application over a decade of deficit irrigation di strategies have been explored to this purpose the analysis of a minimal dataset composed of physiological information stem water potential ψstem and sap flow sf measurements yield fruits number and weight and qualitative parameters titratable acidity ta and total soluble solids tss was performed with reference to the last irrigation seasons i e 2018 19 the applied irrigation treatments were the following sustained deficit irrigation sdi regulated deficit irrigation rdi partial root zone drying prd each distributing a water deficit of about 19 29 and 52 respectively compared to the control treatment fi supplying the full irrigation level 100 etc in general higher water use efficiencies wue have been obtained in di treatments which guarantee greater water savings up to 50 without affecting yield and quality characteristics in particular the most stressed treatment prd while reaching the lowest ψstem values 1 8 to 2 0mpa as also shown by sf versus ψstem clusters resulted in wue values for yield wuey ta wueta and tss wuetss parameters of approximately 2 6 2 9 and 3 1 times greater than fi respectively overall this study allowed identifying the cumulative adaptation characteristics of the orange trees under study to the application of long term di strategies and showing that trees were able to achieve yields and qualitative features similar to those obtained with fi even after 10 years of application of deficient irrigation regimes keywords sustainable citrus production semi arid climate orange groves water deficit 1 introduction nowadays irrigated agriculture has to cope with the increasingly limited availability of water resources which is becoming worrying especially in arid and semi arid areas due to climate change cc scenarios galindo et al 2018 indeed the intensification of drought events expected under the cc scenarios will contribute to the development of stress conditions for crops following the increase in the thermal gradient the reduction of precipitation with consequent negative effects on productivity fracasso et al 2020 in the mediterranean semi arid environment the success of citrus production largely depends on adequate irrigation rallo et al 2017 it is therefore essential to manage the available water resources in a sustainable way in order to optimise the productivity of the citrus groves while enhancing their adaptation to water shortage conditions in this perspective several studies have emphasised the importance of adopting localised irrigation techniques for citrus groves e g surface and sub surface drip irrigation in combination with innovative operating methods e g use of very low flow pressure drippers and the optimal management of irrigation water e g deficit irrigation di including partial root zone drying prd and regulated deficient irrigation rdi provenzano 2005 consoli et al 2017 vanella et al 2018 vanella and consoli 2018 it is known that di strategies such as rdi gasque et al 2016 garcía tejero et al 2010 consoli et al 2014 and prd marsal et al 2008 romero et al 2012 consoli et al 2017 permit to maintain or slightly reduce crop production features by applying a considerably lower amount of irrigation volume with the consequent increase of crop water use efficiency wue english 1990 consoli et al 2012 2014 garcía tejero et al 2011 ballester et al 2011 the adoption of the rdi technique requires a deep knowledge of the physiological crop response to water deficit conditions in order to identify the optimal phenological phase for the application of water restrictions in order to minimise the negative effects on crop yield and quality navarro et al 2010 2015 aguado et al 2012 pérez pérez et al 2009 in particular several studies have shown that the application of moderate water stress conditions on citrus fruits during the flowering and fruit set phases generally compromises the yield due to the increase in fruit fall doorenbos and kassam 1979 ginestar and castel 1996 romero et al 2006a pérez pérez et al 2008 on the other hand water restrictions applied during the last phase of fruit growth and ripening decrease yield by reducing fruit weight and size gonzález altozano and castel 1999 treeby et al 2007 pérez pérez et al 2009 garcía tejero et al 2010 while the period following fruit fall was less sensitive to water restrictions cohen and goell 1988 considering the prd strategy i e irrigation is alternatively applied to only one half of the root zone while the other half is kept dry blackman and davies 1985 several studies have shown that in the root system under drying soil biochemical signals are triggered by the roots to shoot causing physiological responses for plant adaptation such as stomatal conductance gs and plant transpiration reduction dry and loveys 2000 hutton and loveys 2011 mossad et al 2018 2020 gotur et al 2018 the main component of the biochemical signalling process involves the abscissic acid hormone aba also known as plant stress hormone prgomet et al 2020 chai et al 2016 in general higher aba concentrations in the roots and in the leaf tissues have been found during the application of severe di conditions romero conde et al 2014 puglisi et al 2019 and prolonged prd with the consequent increase in the root shoot ratio and greater wue pérez pérez et al 2018 leaf ψleaf and stem water potential ψstem are the most significant physiological indicators capable of monitoring and identifying plant water status taylor et al 2015 jamshidi et al 2020 specifically ψstem measurements are more sensitive to slight differences in plant water status than ψleaf as it is less affected by the evaporative demand and by leaf to leaf variations in stomatal opening and it is more representative of the tree water status than the ψ of an exposed leaf naor 2006 ortuño et al 2006 garcía orellana et al 2013 thus ψstem has become a valuable indicator for irrigation scheduling and has been used as a threshold for both conventional and di management girona et al 2006a 2006b however ψstem refers to a specific moment of the day requiring also frequent repetitions during the irrigation season for a proper crop monitoring ballester et al 2013 ortuño et al 2006 therefore alternative water stress indicators are required to overcome these limitations sap flow sf techniques allow indirectly measurements of plant water losses in particular automated sf systems permit to continuously monitor the transpiration activity of both well watered and deficit irrigated plants smith and allen 1996 goldhamer et al 1999 ortuño et al 2004a 2004b sf is related to external weather conditions

production such as total soluble solids and acidity chartzoulakis et al 1999 for example romero et al 2006b observed a dependency between the decrease in clementine fruit quality and the phenological stage in which di is applied other studies have shown that di conditions may lead to a greater number of smaller fruits treeby et al 2007 conversely peng and rabe 1998 concluded that in satsuma mandarin fruit size was not affected by water restrictions therefore variations in the fruit weight or diameter at any stage of development can depend on the species and change depending on the times and the water restriction imposed by the irrigation regimes although there is a large number of studies conducted in mediterranean semi arid climatic conditions analysing the effects of the adoption of di strategies on citrus ballester et al 2014 gasque et al 2016 gonzalez dugo et al 2018 is important to explore the physiological productive and qualitative adaptation characteristics that this type of crop can acquire after a long term di application table 1 reports a number of study cases evaluating the long term effects of di on citrus crops the main objective of the study was to evaluate the ability of citrus groves c sinensis l osbeck grown in typical semi arid climatic conditions to adapt to the application of moderate severe water deficit regimes after a decade since its plantation in 2010 in particular the cumulative adaption characteristics of the orange groves was assessed on a minimum set of physiological stem water potential ψstem and sap flow sf measurements and productive qualitative indicators considered significant for identifying the water status and water use efficiency features of the crops under study this purpose was achieved i by comparing the behaviour of di trees with those under fi strategies during two irrigation seasons i e 2018 19 and ii by evaluating whether deficit irrigated trees have changed their response over time 2 materials and methods 2 1

minitab inc state college pa usa 3 results 3 1 long term physiological responses of orange orchards to water deficit fig 2 shows the average ψstem values mpa measured at the irrigation treatments during 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons fi and rdi showed similar average ψstem values ranging from 1 36 to 1 62 mpa with the exception of doy 225 2018 when rdi presented significantly lower ψstem values than fi 1 46 and 1 57 mpa for fi and rdi respectively the differences between the two treatments in terms of ψstem are evident and when the rdi was supplied with 50 of etc rdi treatment was irrigated at full i e 100 of etc until doy 204 and doy 217 in 2018 and 2019 respectively sdi and prd evidenced more negative ψstem values than fi with values varying between 1 37 and 1 78 mpa in 2018 and between 1 56 and 2 04 mpa in 2019 fig 3 shows the different clusters obtained by plotting ψstem values and their corresponding hourly sf data note that the clusters present specific distributions mainly as function of the different sf rates due the different degree of water deficits applied in particular the sf ψstem cluster for fi is mainly located in the upper right part of fig 3 denoting higher sf rates from 0 141 to 0 165 mm h 1 with low water stress effects ψstem ranging from 1 3 to 1 6 mpa for sdi and rdi the sf ψstem clusters were distributed between similar ψstem values from 1 3 to 1 8 mpa and in prd the sf ψstem clusters were recognised between ψstem ranging from 1 6 to 1 8 mpa with few exceptions which presented ψstem values lower than 1 9 mpa however these di treatments presented different sf fluxes with rdi having the lowest values 0 076 0 087 mm h 1 followed by sdi 0 100 0 106 mm h 1 and prd 0 115 0 131 mm h 1 respectively 3 2 physiological adaptation to abiotic conditions fig 4 shows the relationship between vpd and sf observed during 2018 2019 at hourly daylight scale two different stages can be differentiated in the sf vpd relationship the first one corresponded with a linear increasing pattern for vpd values ranged between 0 and 2kpa at this stage fi presented a significant higher slope term 0 058 followed by prd 0 042 and sdi 0 037 respectively being rdi the treatment with the lowest slope term 0 035 fig 4 once this vpd threshold was exceeded i e 2kpa the relationship between vpd and sf tended to become more stable until reaching a certain point sfmax where vpd hardly influenced sf sfmax depended also on the irrigation treatment thus whereas sfmax was found approximately at 0 14 mm h 1 for fi di treatments obtained lower values being 0 11 0 09 and 0 07 mm h 1 for prd sdi and rdi respectively the relationship obtained during 2018 2019 between the hourly sf and tair values fig 5 followed almost linear patterns with r2 ranging from 0 58 rdi to 0 74 sdi as for the hourly sf and vpd relationship the sf and tair trends showed different magnitudes i e slope terms in relation to the adopted irrigation strategy in this sense fi presented the higher slope term 5 33e 03 followed by prd 4 06e 03 and sdi 3 46e 03 respectively being rdi the treatment with the lowest slope term 2 58e 03 similar correlation trends to those obtained at hourly scale for vpd and tair with sf were observed also at daily scale but with higher r2 values 0 68 0 74 vs 0 55 0 63 for sf vpd at daily and hourly scale respectively and 0 75 0 83 vs 0 58 0 74 for sf tair at daily and hourly scale respectively fig 6 specifically for daily mean sf vpd relationships fig 6a it can be observed that sfmax values were 1 4 1 1 0 9 and 0 8 for fi prd sdi and rdi respectively regarding the daily mean sf tair relationships fig 6b the slope terms followed the same relative pattern as at hourly scale fig 5 ranging from 0 05 for fi to 0 02 for rdi fig 7 shows the changes in swc observed in the upper soil layer 0 10 0 30 m during the 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons as expected all treatments had daily swc values ranged between the fc and the wp in particular all treatments were characterised by similar average daily swc conditions ranging between 0 22 for sdi and prd to 0 24 cm3 cm 3 for fi and rdi table 4 when comparing the swc trends of the different irrigation treatments it was evidenced that they differed in the amplitude of the drying and wetting cycles which were more pronounced in sdi and especially in prd treatment despite these differences a constant swc trend along the irrigation seasons were observed for all treatments 3 3 crop yield qualitative and wue features in 2019 total yield varied from 25 5 to 31 7 tha 1 and no significant differences were observed among the different irrigation treatments table 5 fruit weight number of fruits and ed also without differences among the irrigation treatments ranged from 249 to 280 g from 286 to 434 and from 77 to 79 mm respectively table 5 the yield parameters obtained in 2020 were similar to those obtained in 2019 table 5 specifically total yield ranged from 29 9 to 34 5 tha 1 fruit weight from 243 to 289 g number of fruit from 302 to 407 and ed from 78 to 82 mm the quality parameters i e ta gl 1 tss brix and mi referring to the 2019 and 2020 harvests 2018 and 2019 irrigation

1 to 11 2 brix and from 8 6 to 9 8 for both harvest periods respectively additionally despite the different levels of water deficit applied no significant differences were observed in qualitative terms between the different irrigation treatments table 7 reports the wue obtained for the productive yield wuey and qualitative features ta wueta and tss wuetss at the different irrigation treatments during the 2019 and 2020 harvest periods 2018 and 2019 irrigation seasons in particular in 2019 the wuey ranged from 8 2 to 17 7 kg m 3 whereas values obtained in 2020 were slightly higher varying from 10 0 to 21 2 kg m 3 when comparing the wuey values obtained for the different irrigation treatments significant differences were obtained between fi 8 2 and 10 0 kg m 3 for 2019 and 2020 respectively and prd 17 7 and 21 2 kg m 3 for 2019 and 2020 respectively regarding wueta the obtained values ranged from 47 7 to 120 7 g m 3 for 2019 and from 66 6 to 138 8 g m 3 in 2020 being wueta for prd significantly higher than those referring to the other irrigation treatments for the harvest periods finally wuetss ranged from 433 to 1047gm 3 in 2019 whereas higher values were obtained in 2020 varying from 601 to 1346 g m 3 as for wueta significant differences were found for wuetss between prd and the other irrigation treatments 4 discussion in this study the adaptation effects related to the adoption of di strategies applied over a decade in an orange orchard have been explored through the analysis of a dataset composed of physiological information i e including the main representative plant water status indicators and yield qualitative parameters with reference to two last irrigation seasons 2018 2019 which are influenced by a decade of application of di strategies the different amount of irrigation volumes supplied during the long term di application at the study site table 2 resulted mainly dependent on the year specific climatic conditions and on the progressive growth of the orange trees i e affecting the localised factor and the kc values previous studies conducted at the experimental site under study have intensively analysed the specific effects due to the application of different levels of water deficit conditions on different physiological parameters such as gs ψstem sf leaf photosynthesis and canopy temperature i e for the irrigation seasons 2011 12 in consoli et al 2014 for 2011 12 in stagno et al 2015 for 2013 14 in consoli et al 2017 for 2015 in puglisi et al 2019 for 2018 in pappalardo et al 2019 from these studies ψstem and sf were identified as physiological proxies due to their ability to detect the responses to water deficit among the irrigation treatments under study as shown in puglisi et al 2019 for orange orchards growing in mediterranean semi arid conditions the mean ψstem values for fi full irrigation showed a similar trend to rdi presenting almost constant values during the irrigation season both before and after the application of the water restriction fig 2 this decrease in ψstem differences over time between the di treatments specifically rdi and fi could be directly ascribed to the adaptation features developed by the crop following the long term di application since the influence of phenology and the crop size had a minimal effect on ψstem behaviour in fact ψstem measurements were carried out always during the same phenological stage from mid june to september and the main morphological parameters were quite constant during the last irrigation seasons table 3 and stable during the years because trees were commonly subjected to a minimal harvest a simple evaluation of the ψstem values observed after intense rain events has permitted to determine the ψstem behaviour under no water stress conditions at the study site in particular the ψstem value in fi after a rain event of 33 mm doy 217 2018 fig 7 was around 1 46 mpa focusing also during other rain events occurred during previous irrigation seasons similar ψstem values were reached as for instance in consoli et al 2014 with ψstem values of 1 4 to 1 5 mpa in fi after rain events of 8 and 13 mm on doys 224 and 247 2012 respectively similarly consoli et al 2017 found ψstem values of about 1 6 mpa after a rain event of 37 mm on doy 260 2013 finally after a rain event of 43 mm on doy 223 224 2015 puglisi et al 2019 ψstem values of 1 3 mpa were measured these findings support the hypothesis that fi properly corresponded with a close to non water stress conditions since ψstem values measured in fi during the study period were within this range of values the ψstem behaviour at fi condition is reflected in swc fig 7 being this treatment characterised by higher swc values than the other di treatments thus showing less resistance to root water uptake this was confirmed also by the sf observations figs 3 5 in comparison to fi sdi showed slightly more negative ψstem values according to the lower swc condition fig 7 other studies have shown a simultaneous reduction in ψstem and gs rates due to the swc deficit ballester et al 2013 garcía tejero et al 2011 gasque et al 2016 the lower swc condition observed at sdi in comparison to fi and rdi is probably due to a higher root density concentrated in the most upper part of the soil until 40 cm of depth where the sdi drip lines are located this hypothesis was supported by visual observations carried out on excavated pits that showed higher concentration of fine roots covering the buried drips in sdi than in fi and rdi soil profiles as expected the lowest ψstem values fig 2 were recorded in the most severe di treatment prd doy 214 and 231 in 2019 with values of 1 95 mpa and 2 04 mpa respectively figs 2 3 in which the swc reached the lowest values fig 7 however the general trend observed for swc always ranged between the wp and fc during the irrigation seasons at all treatments fig 7 demonstrating the suitability of the adoption of the fao 56 etc method for scheduling the irrigation in combination with the use of site specific adjusting parameters for taking into account the crop and soil characteristics this was also confirmed by no drainage patterns observed in the soil profile by electrical resistivity imaging technique vanella et al 2020 overall as shown in the sf ψstem clusters fig 3 crops were able to maintain a certain degree of water stress our results proof that over time the citrus grove has been adapted to water stress without affecting yield and quality characteristics tables 5 6 similar ψstem values have been observed by ballester et al 2014 and gasque et al 2016 who showed that ψstem values in citrus should not exceed 1 5 mpa and 2 0 mpa respectively in the mediterranean semi arid environment as for the ψstem the transpirative response was able to reflect the di conditions occurring at the study site as function of the different magnitude of the applied water deficit and the evaporative demand see the correlations between the sf and the climatic parameters vpd and tair figs 4 5 which coincides with the findings of saitta et al 2020 these results are in accordance with several researches showing a general decrease of the sf rates due to the application of di strategies espadafor et al 2017 lόpez lόpez et al 2018 roccuzzo et al 2014a b herein it is possible to note that the sf rates of the di treatments were lower than the sf fluxes observed in fi which depends on the level of accumulated water stress throughout the day and environmental demand a peculiar trend was observed in prd in which 50 of the irrigation volume of fi was applied that showed sf fluxes greater than the other di treatments sdi and rdi this is probably due to the prd operational mode that used alternating two dripper lines located at the eastern and western side of the trees this permits the root system to explore a larger soil volume and to have access to more water resources mingo et al 2004 that otherwise they would not be able to reach in this sense mary et al 2019 observed privileged direction of root development in prd with greater rooting extent in comparison to full rate conditions in addition according to chai et al 2016 the application of the prd strategy causes a compensatory effect on sf fluxes specifically the sf rate tends to increase when the roots have directly access to water wetted area whereas sf is reduced when the root system is in dry conditions dry area with poor access to water the alternation of the wet dry portions due to the prd strategy contributes to maintain as in our case higher sf rates in accordance to other studies e g kang et al 2003 gonzález altozano et al 2008 du et al 2008 dragoni et al 2009 köhler et al 2010 a close relationship between the sf fluxes and the weather factors was observed such as vpd and tair however a great variability of the sf rates for any vpd was observed mainly due to the stomatal adjustment as shown in figs 4 5 in particular it can be noted that fi is characterised by higher sf vpd and sf tair positive trends than the di treatments sdi rdi and prd this behaviour is mainly due to the applied di conditions that for tair and vpd increasing may lead to stomatal closure and therefore to sf rates reduction consoli et al 2014 stomatal closure in response to the vpd increases could be an effective strategy to avoid excessive water loss in drought conditions and prevent that the ψstem falls to dangerous water stress levels tyree and sperry 1988 granier et al 2000 fig 3 from the crop productivity point of view previous studies carried at the same experimental orchard have shown statistically significant differences among the different di treatments and fi consoli et al 2014 2017 mainly showing slighter fruit weight for the di trees for the last two irrigation seasons under study the productive features i e yield parameters fruit weight number of fruits and ed did not show significant differences among the irrigation treatments as also reported in puglisi et al 2019 this could indicate that plants have adapted over time to these stresses eliminating the differences in terms of production compared to the fi these evidences are also confirmed by the similar morphological characteristics obtained among the treatments under study table 3 similar results were obtained by garcía tejero et al 2011 and aguado et al 2012 who showed that the di application conditions did not influence the final yield for citrus in comparison to the well irrigated conditions however adu et al 2018 argued that yield response under water saving irrigation strategies is context specific and mainly depends on crop species and soil texture water productivity has become a key requirement in sustainable crop production and environmental management adu et al 2019 the applied water deficit in fruit crops has been associated with wue increasing not only in terms of wuey garcía tejero et al 2010 carr 2012 but also considering wuetss and wueta in general the effects of di strategies on the fruits qualitative characteristics have been studied in a wide range of crop types including olives wahbi et al 2005 grapes salon et al 2004 and various citrus varieties such as valencian orange castel and buj 1990 lemon sánchez blanco et al 1989 mandarin peng and rabe 1998 within the qualitative aspects tss and ta contents increases represent a consolidated response to water deficit in citrus fruits even if the water deficit is applied during the whole season or during fruit growth stages hutton et al 2007 hutton and loveys 2011 garcía tejero et al 2010 a meta analysis on the effects of fi and di on quality attributes conducted by adu et al 2019 reported that di strategies reached higher improvements than fi when considering improvement in tss without significantly altering ta or ph of fruits the increase of tss and ta in response to water deficit is a very well established response in citrus fruits particularly when the water deficit is imposed during the whole season hutton and loveys 2011 or during some fruit growth phases hutton et al 2007 garcía tejero et al 2010 for example in studies conducted by hutton and loveys 2011 on navel orange the concentrations of tss and acid g of citric acid 100 ml of juice were higher in trees treated with prd with values respectively of 13 9 and 1 59 compared to normally irrigated trees whose values were respectively 13 5 and 1 42 conversely to previous studies conducted in the same orchard where the tss values for sdi rdi and prd were respectively 1 02 1 11 and 1 10 times higher than the fi treatment consoli et al 2014 2017 and according to studies conducted by other authors ballester et al 2014 garcía tejero et al 2010 yakushiji et al 1996 mossad et al 2020 which found a significant increase of tss and ta in the context of di strategies in this study no statistically significant differences were observed between di and fi treatments in terms of quality parameters this evidences the adaptation effects of the citrus orchard under study due to the application of the long term di strategies the mitigation of the differences in crop quality and production features among the di treatments and the control over the years can be interpreted as an adaptation measure adopted by the plants for facing the water deficit conditions for increasing stress tolerance including molecular mechanisms and concomitant growth adjustment osakabe et al 2014 these latter include stomatal responses ion transport activation of stress signalling pathways i e aba puglisi et al 2019 and response to reduce photosynthetic activity this adaptation effect is also interpreted in wue terms table 7 which shows higher values for di treatments sdi rdi and prd and increases over time with higher wue values for 2019 compared to 2018 this increase over time is evident by comparing the wue values of each irrigation treatment for the study years 2018 2019 with the lower values reported in consoli et al 2014 2017 for the same experimental site in particular prd in which the most severe water restriction was imposed showed the highest wue values highlighting the advantages of the prd adoption for obtaining significant water savings up to 50 this result is in accordance to most of the studies carried out on prd strategies in the context of fruit trees that have experienced higher wue values in di conditions being the applied irrigation volumes the critical component for the wue increasing santos et al 2005 spreer et al 2009 in addition the application of the prd in areas with reduced water availability is useful not only to guarantee water savings improve the use of nutrients and increase maintain yield but also for the production of foods with better characteristics nutritional and health jovanovic and stikic 2018 finally the results of this study contribute to describe the effects on crop characteristics due to the long term di conditions highlighting the success of the applications of the di strategies in terms of yield quality and water savings for citrus crops in mediterranean semi arid environments where water resources are limited such as in sicily 5 conclusion the main conclusion that can be drawn from this study are reported as follows the long term di strategies can be successfully applied to high value cropping systems like orange orchards in semi arid climatic conditions overall from the observed sf ψstem clusters crops were able to maintain a certain degree of water stress without causing negative effects on the yield and fruit quality the di treatments have modified the relationships that link the sf vdp and sf tair showing lower trends compared to the fully irrigated treatment the application of the di strategies allowed water savings up to 53 for the prd treatment with consequent increases in the wue without compromising yield and fruit main quality parameters ta and tss the present study suggests the usefulness of starting the application of di to young citrus plants from the beginning of their transplantation in the open field in order to favour the progressive adaptation of the crop to the imposed water regimes this long term study sets the basis for the transfer of research knowledge about di application to the real citrus context

10202,understanding the interaction effects of water fertilizer and salinity is of great environmental importance to mitigate soil salinization and improve crop production field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of water quality irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on soil salt accumulation root water and nitrogen uptake lint yield and water productivity during 2018 and 2019 growing seasons of cotton gossypium hirsutum l in arid region of xinjiang china four irrigation levels 75 100 125 and 150 of crop water requirement etc and four nitrogen levels 195 255 315 and 375 kg ha 1 were applied with groundwater and brackish water irrigation results demonstrated that brackish water irrigation significantly increased the root zone soil salt accumulation ssa either increasing irrigation amount during the squaring stage or decreasing irrigation amount during the flower boll stage with higher nitrogen application rate can reduce the ssa and with an increase in brackish water irrigation amount a corresponding increase in nitrogen application rate is required to reduce the possible soil salt accumulation during the flower boll stage highest irrigation amount 150 etc and nitrogen application rate 375 kg ha 1 at the flower boll stage and during the whole growing season resulted in significant higher nitrogen uptake increment with an increasing rate of 25 74 and 39 65 respectively the integration of higher irrigation amount and highest nitrogen application rate with groundwater irrigation produced higher lint yield and water productivity considering soil salinity and lint yield as well as water productivity the appropriate integration modes of water and nitrogen are higher irrigation amount and highest nitrogen application rate 125 etc and 375 kg ha 1 for groundwater and lowest irrigation amount and lower nitrogen application rate 75 etc and 255 kg ha 1 for brackish water keywords fertigation soil salt accumulation water consumption lint yield water productivity 1 introduction mulched drip irrigation has been commonly used since 1990s for cotton cultivation in xinjiang uygur autonomous region china zhang et al 2014 melting glaciers are the sole water source in tarim basin in xinjiang one of the driest areas in the world jiang et al 2005 the scarcity of fresh water has strictly restricted the growth of agricultural production moreover the contradiction between water supply and demand caused by the rise in cotton planting areas has led to extreme water shortages guo and shen 2016 however widespread shallow brackish water with total dissolved solids above 2 3 g l 1 exhibited great potential for agricultural irrigation to compensate for the lack of available fresh water in these regions wang et al 2011 indeed such brackish water has been effectively applied with proper irrigation and fertigation management practices in cotton planting yasuor et al 2020 meanwhile the improper management of fertigation brackish and fresh water in israel egypt and usa has induced the secondary salinization in cotton field burt et al 2003 soil salinity is the most damaging environmental stress which contribute to major reductions in cultivated land area crop productivity and quality yamaguchi and blumwald 2005 therefore urgent measures are required to further increase the understanding of this issue and improve irrigation and fertigation management for cotton with groundwater and brackish water salinity control strategies generally aim to mitigate the salts accumulation in the root zone to levels that not restrict the root water uptake the appropriate irrigation and fertigation management is an option to alleviate the negative effects of salinity on crop development wang et al 2013 indicated the medium irrigation quota 295 mm produced lower salt content in the 0 60 cm soil layer jiang et al 2019 reported that the nitrogen application rate of 180 270 kg ha 1 at soil moisture levels of 100 and 90 field capacity did not cause salt accumulation in the soil root zone in addition the interaction between water quality and irrigation amount has a certain effect on soil salinity the application of low saline water with increasing irrigation amount alleviated soil salinity while increased under high saline water brackish water wang et al 2015 ahmed et al 2012 reported that irrigation with saline water of 7 5dsm 1 had significantly increased the soil salinity as well as excessive application of nitrogen n release higher quantity of base cations to soil solution accelerating soil salinization han et al 2014 in turn the elevated soil salinity inhibits the root nitrogen uptake min et al 2014 indicated that soil salinity increased slightly as the rate of nitrogen application increased especially in brackish and saline water irrigation therefore it can be concluded that the effects of irrigation and fertigation as well as water quality on soil salinity dynamic are complicated previous research mainly focused on single or interactions of multi factors i e water quality irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate there is still little information on the interaction of three factors on soil salt accumulation irrigation water quality and irrigation amount as well as nitrogen application rate significantly affected the change of soil salinity in root zone and thus influencing the crop growth mahmoodi eshkaftaki and rafiee 2020 hu et al 2012 reported that when cotton was irrigated with saline water greater than 2 24 g l 1 the salt is accumulated and the root weight density for treatments irrigated with fresh water was clearly greater than that irrigated with brackish water or saline water suitable irrigation strategy is of great importance for crop production under brackish water irrigation tan et al 2018 forkutsa et al 2009 suggested eight irrigations of total 580 mm with each time between 60 mm and 100 mm using brackish water were adequate to avoid notable plant water stress furthermore complex interactions exist among irrigation fertilizers soil salinity and crop performance in drip irrigated fields min et al 2016 chen et al 2010 reported that the cotton growth was significantly affected by interaction between soil salinity and nitrogen application rate higher application rate of nitrogen can alleviate the soil salinization salt stress effects machado and serralheiro 2017 resulting in increasing crop water consumption evapotranspiration and crop growth min et al 2014 bastida et al 2017 confirmed positive effects of regulated deficit irrigation with reclaimed water on plant productivity in semi arid area additional information about the interactive effects of water quality irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on soil salt accumulation and crop growth would be helpful for determining the irrigation and fertilization strategies for mulched drip irrigation with different water qualities the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the effects of water quality irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on soil salt accumulation nitrogen uptake increment water consumption and lint yield of cotton and 2 to develop an appropriate irrigation and fertigation management practices for different water qualities through considering the root zone soil salt accumulation crop yield and water productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field the field experiments were conducted at the soil and water conservation monitoring station of the first

was calculated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 by a crop coefficient kc which was adjusted according to yang et al 2016 2 3 irrigation and fertigation schedule different water qualities were used for irrigation approximately every 7 days from the squaring to the flower boll stage which was a total of 10 times in 2018 and 12 times in 2019 basal nitrogen fertilizer was applied at rate of 75 kg ha 1 and 120 kg ha 1 before seeding in 2018 and 2019 respectively the remained dosage was fertigated through mulched drip irrigation systems according to a ratio of 3 4 3 during squaring early flowering boll and late flowering boll stages fig 2 the dissolved urea was applied into each field plot using a proportional pump mis rite model 2504 tefen following a strategy of 1 4 w 1 2 n 1 4 w that was recommended by li et al 2004 the actual irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate are shown in fig 2 2 4 samplings and measurements 2 4 1 measurements of soil water contents time domain reflectometer trime fm imko gmbh ettlingen germany was used to monitor the soil volumetric water content one day before and one day after each irrigation event in both seasons access tubes with length of 120 cm were installed in each plot as shown in fig 1 soil water content was measured at 10 cm intervals down to 100 cm in addition soil samples were collected using a soil drill at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm at soil sampling points fig 1 within all plots of each treatment and soil water content measured by gravimetric method with one day before and two days after each fertigation event was used to check the trime fm data 2 4 2 measurements of soil salt contents and soil salt accumulation chen et al 2018 stated that cotton roots were mainly located within the top 0 40 cm of soil therefore the top 0 40 cm soil layer was considered as the main root zone of cotton in the following analysis soil samples at depths of 0 20 20 40 cm were selected to measured soil salt content for each sample 10 g of air dried soil passing through a 2 mm sieve were extracted with 50 ml of deionized water and soil conductivity namely ec1 5 were determined using a portable conductivity meter mettler toledo f3 standard mettler toledo company switzerland the dynamic change of soil salinity was described using the values of soil salt content a water bath heating method was used to calibrate the soil salt content and ec1 5 dsm 1 yielding the following equation 1 s 5 1367 c n 55 r 2 0 969 where s is soil salt content gkg 1 and c is the ec1 5 of soil samples dsm 1 root zone soil salt accumulation ssa was calculated as the difference between the content of salinity at the end and beginning of each given growth stage the soil salt content before sowing was 3 55 g kg 1 in 2018 and 3 86 g kg 1 in 2019 when ssa is positive it means salt accumulated in the top 0 40 cm of soil and if negative the desalination occurred 2 4 3 measurements of plant nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency at each sampling location three selected plants three rows cotton of semi mulch in 2018 and six selected plants six rows cotton of semi mulch i e increasing the number of samples to reduce sample error in 2019 were collected by clipping the aboveground plant at the seedling stage the squaring stage the flower boll stage and the mature stage the plant samples were air dried and weighed to determine the aboveground plant biomass then the total n content of the plant samples was measured using a kjeltec analyzer kjeltec 2300 foss denmark the plant n uptake was determined by the product of the aboveground plant biomass and the n content the nitrogen uptake increment nui was calculated as the difference between the content of n uptake at the end and beginning of each given growth stage to quantify the proportion of crop nitrogen uptake in the total source of nitrogen the following nitrogen use efficiency nue parameter was calculated

covered with plastic mulch 2 4 4 measurements of lint yield and water productivity for each sample location the seed cotton was collected along six central 2 m long rows and the total weight of the six rows was used to represent the yield for this location the seed cotton samples for each plot were weighed and 50 g sub samples were ginned to determine the lint percentage the lint yield for each sample location was determined by multiplying the lint percentage by the respective seed cotton weight the crop water consumption was represented by the actual evapotranspiration et a mm calculated using the following water balance equation allen et al 1998 3 e t a i p e d p r o f f δ s where i is the irrigation amount mm p e is the effective rainfall mm d p is the deep percolation mm which was neglected due to low value of deep percolation under mulched drip irrigation zhang et al 2017 r off is runoff mm which was also ignored due to the weak topographic variations in this field and the low rainfall and irrigation intensity and δs is the variation in soil water storage mm in the 0 1 0 m soil layers between the initial and terminal stages therefore et a can be described as 4 e t a i p e δ

nui water consumption lint yield and wp at the probability levels of 0 05 or 0 01 duncan s multiple range tests were calculated at the level of 0 05 for significantly different main effects it should be pointed out that since i2 was only treated under groundwater irrigation therefore all treatments at the level of i2 were excluded in the significance analysis these statistical tests were performed using the spss 23 0 software spss inc chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 soil salt accumulation in the root zone the ssa at different growth stages during the 2018 and 2019 seasons are indicated in tables 4 and 5 appropriate irrigation scheduling at squaring and flower boll stages can effectively reduce the soil salt accumulation at the squaring stage increasing irrigation amount can reduce the ssa when using groundwater irrigation the ssa for the 125 etc i3 and 100 etc i2 level at the squaring stage in 2018 was 52 and 75 lower than that for the 75 etc i1 level and the desalination i e the ssa changing from 0 6 g kg 1 to 0 05 g kg 1 occurred with increasing of irrigation amount from i1 to i3 under brackish water irrigation when increasing the upper limit of irrigation amount to 150 etc i4 in 2019 the i4 level produced the negative values of ssa of 0 6 g kg 1 and 0 1 g kg 1 under groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively at the flower boll stage of cotton decreasing irrigation amount reduced the ssa when using groundwater irrigation the desalination occurred with i1 and i3 levels in 2018 and in 2019 with the decreasing of irrigation amount from i4 to i2 the ssa changed from 0 2 g kg 1 to 1 6 g kg 1 for brackish water irrigation the decreasing rate of ssa was 78 and 25 as the irrigation amount decreased from i3 to i1 in 2018 and i4 to i3 in 2019 respectively nitrogen application rate produced a significant effect on the ssa at the mature stage in 2018 and during squaring to flower boll stages in 2019 tables 4 and 5 at the squaring stage in 2018 with the increasing nitrogen application rate from f1 to f2 and from f2 to f3 under brackish water irrigation the decreasing rate of the ssa was 35 and 54 respectively while medium nitrogen application rate f2 produced the lower ssa by 58 84 under groundwater irrigation similar result was found in 2019 the ssa of f2 level was negative with both groundwater and brackish water irrigation at the squaring stage at the flower boll stage higher nitrogen application rate of f3 and f4 reduced the ssa under groundwater irrigation when using brackish water irrigation the nitrogen application rate of f4 produced the lower ssa by 95 and 97 than f3 and f2 respectively at the mature stage in 2018 the highest nitrogen application rate f3 significantly reduced the ssa by 49 99 irrigation water quality produced a significant effect on the ssa at the flower boll stage and the whole growth stage of cotton both in 2018 and 2019 tables 4 and 5 irrigation with brackish water significantly increased the ssa from 0 2 to 1 5 g kg 1 to 2 1 5 1 g kg 1 at the flower boll stage the ssa ranged from 0 35 0 26 g kg 1 and 0 75 3 38 g kg 1 under groundwater and brackish water respectively during the whole growing season irrigation with brackish water significantly produced the higher ssa by 141 and 422 for irrigation amount of i1 and i3 respectively in 2018 and by 109 and 15 times of i3 and i4 respectively in 2019 irrigation water quality is the extremely important factor in salt accumulation and an appropriate irrigation amount can control the ssa under brackish water irrigation there was a significant interaction effect between irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on the ssa at the flower boll stage in 2018 and the whole growth stage in 2018 and in 2019 tables 4 and 5 at the flower boll stage in 2018 when using groundwater irrigation with lowest irrigation amount of i1 medium nitrogen application rate of f2 reduced the ssa down to desalination at 2 2 g kg 1 however with the irrigation amount increasing to i3 nitrogen application rate of f3 can reduce the ssa by 3 7 g kg 1 when using brackish water irrigation the combinations of lowest irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate i1f1s and highest irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate i3f3s reduced the ssa by 5 0 5 6 g kg 1 and 50 61 this indicated that with an increase of irrigation amount a corresponding increase in nitrogen application rate is required to reduce the possible soil salt accumulation a significant interaction effect between irrigation amount and irrigation water quality on the ssa was found at the flower boll stage in 2018 table 4 when using groundwater irrigation increasing irrigation amount to i3 produced the desalination at 0 4 g kg 1 however when using brackish water irrigation i3 increased the ssa by 353 this indicated that with an increase of brackish water irrigation amount the salinity brought into the root zone by irrigation water is greater than the salinity leached from the root zone we also discovered a significant interaction effect between nitrogen application rate and irrigation water quality on the ssa at the mature stage in 2018 and at the squaring stage in 2019 tables 4 and 5 at the mature stage in 2018 decreasing nitrogen application rate to f1 reduced the ssa by 12 78 with groundwater irrigation however when using brackish water f1 increased the ssa by 229 544 at the squaring stage in 2019 the treatment of i4f4s produced the significantly higher ssa with brackish water irrigation but no significant differences were found among the treatments of i4f2g i4f3g and i4f4g this indicated that appropriate nitrogen applied increase can produce lower ssa under brackish water irrigation but excessive nitrogen applied would aggravate soil salt accumulation significant interaction effect among irrigation amount nitrogen application rate and irrigation water quality was found during squaring to flower boll stages in 2018 and during the whole growth stage in 2019 tables 4 and 5 considering the sustainable impact of irrigation and fertilization on the soil environment during the whole growing season of cotton in two years the combinations of medium irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate 100 etc and 315 kg ha 1 for groundwater irrigation and lowest irrigation amount and medium nitrogen application rate 75 etc and 255 kg ha 1 for brackish water irrigation can achieve the goal of fresh water saving and salt control for environment friendly agriculture 3 2 plant nitrogen uptake increment the nui and nue during the 2018 and 2019 seasons are presented in tables 6 and 7 the nue roughly reflects the change rule of nui during the whole growth period the anova results showed that the irrigation amount produced a significant effect on nui during the flower boll stage and the whole growth stage in 2019 table 7 a significant effect on nue was also found in 2019 table 7 the highest irrigation amount produced a higher nui and nue with both groundwater and brackish water irrigation in 2019 when using groundwater irrigation the nui of i4 was greater than that of i3 and i2 by 48 and 67 25 and 25 at the flower boll stage and the whole growth stage respectively and the nui of i4 was greater than that of i3 by 74 and 37 with brackish water irrigation in 2019 meanwhile irrigation amount i4 produced the higher nue by 23 36 no significant effect was found in 2018 table 6 however the nui of lowest irrigation amount of i1 is greater than that of i3 by 7 with brackish water irrigation at the flower boll stage which is largely depending on the lower ssa produced by the lowest irrigation amount fertilization is a strategy to minimize soil salt accumulation and thus to promote plant growth the anova results also showed that the highest nitrogen application rate produced a significant higher nui in both two years and higher nue in 2019 tables 6 and 7 in 2018 the nui of f3 was significantly greater than that of f2 and f1 by 7 and 39 32 and 8 with groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively at the whole growth stage and in 2019 the nui of f4 was significantly greater than that of f3 and f2 by 17 65 and 10 104 since the flower boll stage meanwhile nitrogen application rate f4 produced the higher nue by 35 46 and 4 11 with groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively it indicated that total n uptake increased with the increasing of nitrogen fertilizer application rate at lower soil salinity environment the irrigation water quality presented a significant effect on nui and nue at the whole growth stage in 2019 table 7 the nui and nue with the groundwater irrigation were greater than that of brackish water irrigation by 6 in the process of brackish water irrigation more salt is brought into the soil and the salt reduces the permeability of the soil and soil water potential thus affecting the nitrogen uptake of crops there was a significant interaction effect between nitrogen application rate and irrigation water quality on the nui during flower boll and whole growth stages in both 2018 and 2019 tables 6 and 7 at the flower boll stage in 2018 the medium nitrogen application rate of f2 produced the higher nui by 39 and 60 under groundwater irrigation of i1 while the nui of f3 was 26 and 98 greater than f1 and f2 using brackish water irrigation respectively similarly the highest nitrogen application rate of f3 produced a higher and lower nui under groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively with irrigation amount of i3 in 2019 the highest nitrogen application rate of f4 under groundwater irrigation produced a higher nui by 9 164 however f4 produced the lower nui by 23 and 26 than f3 and f2 under brackish water irrigation this indicated that increasing nitrogen application promoted crop growth while those effects are decreased with irrigation water salinity increasing significant interaction effects of i f in 2019 and i q and i f q in 2018 during flower boll and whole growth stages were also found tables 6 and 7 at the flower boll stage in 2019 the treatment of i3f4s produced a lower nui than that of i3f3s and i3f2s by 23 and 26 but the nui of treatment of i4f4s was greater than i4f3s and i4f2s by 79 and 33 it showed that high n application under brackish water irrigation can promote crop growth with higher irrigation support in 2018 the highest irrigation amount of i3 under groundwater irrigation produced a higher nui by 95 than i1 with nitrogen application rate of f3 but i1 produced a higher nui under brackish water irrigation by 49 than i3 it indicated that deficit irrigation 75 etc i1 alleviated soil salt accumulation and thus promoted the growth of crops under brackish water irrigation considering the interactions of i f q the highest nui and nue were obtained by the fertigation combination of 100 etc and 315 kg ha 1 for groundwater water irrigation and the fertigation combination of 75 etc and 315 kg ha 1 for brackish water irrigation 3 3 water consumption the water consumption during the 2018 and 2019 seasons are shown in table 8 the anova results indicated that the irrigation amount produced a significant effect on water consumption at the flower boll stage and the whole growth stage the highest irrigation amount generally produced higher water consumption the irrigation amount of i3 in 2018 produced higher water consumption by 6 42 than i2 and i1 under groundwater irrigation and by 43 47 than i1 under brackish water irrigation similarly in 2019 the water consumption of i4 was greater than that of i3 and i2 by 23 44 that of i3 by 14 18 under groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively in addition the nitrogen application rate produced a significant effect on water consumption at the flower boll stage in 2018 and 2019 table 8 the lowest nitrogen application level generally produced higher water consumption with the increase of nitrogen application rate the water consumption was presented a decreasing trend in 2018 while a first decreasing and then increasing trend in 2019 the water consumption at the flower boll stage under the lowest nitrogen application level of f1 were greater than f2 and f3 by 6 and 13 in 2018 while f2 were greater than f3 and f4 by 15 and 7 in 2019 the irrigation water quality produced a significant effect on water consumption at the whole growth stage table 8 the water consumption for groundwater irrigation was greater than brackish water irrigation by 7 and 4 in 2018 and 2019 there was a significant interaction effect between irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on the water consumption at the flower boll stage and the whole growth stage in 2018 table 8 the nitrogen application rate of f2 produced the higher and lower water consumption under i1 and i3 respectively resulting in an increasing rate of 5 27 and a decreasing rate of 8 15 this indicated that medium nitrogen application rate of f2 promoted root water uptake largely depending on the lower ssa significant interaction effects of i q at the squaring stage in 2018 and at the whole growth stage in 2019 and i f q during whole growth stage in 2018 were also found table 8 at the squaring stage in 2018 the groundwater irrigation produced the higher water consumption by 9 under lowest irrigation amount i1 however the groundwater irrigation produced the lower water consumption by 19 under higher irrigation amount i3 similarly at the whole growth stage in 2019 the difference of water consumption between groundwater and brackish water irrigation was below 1 under i3 but with highest irrigation amount i4 the water consumption for groundwater irrigation was greater than brackish water irrigation by 8 this indicated that an appropriate irrigation amount can alleviate the salt stress caused by brackish water irrigation and improve the root water uptake considering the interactions of i f q the treatment of i3f1g and i3f3s produced the highest water consumption under groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively 3 4 lint yield and water productivity the cotton lint yield and water productivity during the 2018 and 2019 seasons are presented in fig 3 the anova results showed that the irrigation amount produced a significant effect on lint yield and water productivity in 2018 table 9 the highest irrigation level i3 in 2018 generally produced a higher lint yield the increase rates were 12 and 30 than i2 and i1 with groundwater irrigation and 12 than i1 with brackish water irrigation with upper limit of irrigation level increasing to 150 etc i4 in 2019 there was a 3 increase of yield the water productivity decreased significantly with the increasing of irrigation amount fig 3 and table 9 the decreasing rate was 6 24 and 9 16 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the nitrogen application rate produced significant effects on lint yield and water productivity in 2019 table 9 the highest nitrogen application level of f4 produced the largest lint yield and water productivity compared with the f2 and f3 level the increase rates of lint yield were 9 and 13 and the increase rates of water productivity were 6 and 17 however no significant effect on lint yield and water productivity was found in 2018 it also can be presented that the medium nitrogen application rate f2 produced the higher lint yield by 11 12 and higher water productivity by 5 8 a significant effect of irrigation water quality on lint yield was observed in 2018 and 2019 table 9 the lint yield under brackish water irrigation was significantly lower by 11 and 8 during the 2018 and 2019 seasons while no significant effect of irrigation water quality on water productivity was found no significant effects of pairwise interactions and three factor interactions among i n and q on lint yield and water productivity were found in both seasons table 9 when using groundwater irrigation the combination of treatment of i3f2g produced the highest lint yield in 2018 and the treatment of i3f4g produced the highest lint yield and wp in 2019 however no significant differences of lint yield were found among the treatments under brackish water irrigation fig 3 the combination treatment of i3f2g produced the highest lint yield in 2018 but the lint yield reduced by 24 in 2019 largely depending on the ssa increased by 41 fig 3 and table 5 considering lint yield and water productivity as well as the ssa of two years the obtained optimum combinations of water and nitrogen are 125 etc and 375 kg ha 1 for groundwater irrigation and 75 etc and 255 kg ha 1 for brackish water irrigation the lint yield water productivity and ssa are 4127 kg ha 1 9 915 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 1 454 g kg 1 and 3227 kg ha 1 8 956 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 1 832 g kg 1 respectively 4 discussion in this study the interaction effect of irrigation amount and water quality on ssa nui water consumption lint yield and water productivity is complicated due to that both groundwater and brackish water contain some soluble salt ions which would accumulate in the root zone of cotton after irrigation previous studies indicated that the soil salt accumulation increased gradually with increase of irrigation water salinity and decrease of irrigation water amount yuan et al 2019 in 2018 a significant interaction effect of irrigation amount and water quality was observed in ssa and nui at the flower boll stage nue during the whole growth period lower and higher irrigation amount i1 and i3 decreased the ssa to desalination with groundwater and increased the ssa with brackish water mostafazadeh fard et al 2007 also reported that leaching can decrease soil salinity to desalination effectively by improving the quality of irrigation water with groundwater irrigation amount increasing the nui and lint yield increased by 27 and 30 under lower soil salt environment guan et al 2013 also reported that a higher irrigation level under low water salinity produced a significantly greater plant nitrogen uptake since the flower boll stage when brackish water irrigation amount were increasing the salinity brought into the root zone by irrigation water is greater than the salinity leached from the root zone the brought salinity contains a lager of soluble salt ions especially na cl and so4 2 table 2 which can destroy the mineral nutrition balance in crop body and cause the disorder of cell metabolism mansour 1994 accordingly deficit irrigation 75 etc i1 alleviated soil salt accumulation produced higher nui and water productivity under brackish water irrigation by 7 and 31 than i3 the loss of nui happened at the highest irrigation amount demonstrated that the increased amount of irrigation water could not compensate the inhibition of the brought salinity which are in accordance with research of jiang et al 2012 also these results further strengthened the previous conclusion that using brackish water may increase the risk of soil salinization and thus significantly affected the uptake of nutrients by the plant mostafazadeh fard et al 2007 chakraborty et al 2016 therefore when irrigated with water containing a certain amount of salt the irrigation amount and water quality should be coupled reasonably appropriately increasing nitrogen application rate can mitigate salt stress and promote crop growth zeng et al 2015 ma et al 2017 significant interaction effect of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water quality was found in ssa at the squaring and mature stage nui and nue during the whole growth period nitrogen application significantly increased cotton nitrogen uptake under fresh and brackish water irrigation hou et al 2010 compared with f1 medium nitrogen application rate f2 with groundwater irrigation reduced the ssa by 25 63 increased the nui by 30 and produced higher lint yield and water productivity by 7 17 and 4 20 respectively however the nitrification of excess nitrogen fertilizers led to a large release of protons and soil acidification further induced the direct release of base cations to soil solution accelerating soil salinization han et al 2014 whereas when using brackish water irrigation nitrogen application rate increased to f3 and f4 can reduce the ssa by 49 84 increase the nui by 3 44 and thus produce higher lint yield by 2 5 high soil salinity inhibited the growth and n uptake of cotton mainly through osmotic stress nutritional imbalance and specific ion toxicity alam 1999 jacoby 1994 munns and tester 2008 one explanation of nitrogen application mitigating salt stress is that nitric acid applied with fertigation reduces soil ph and increases ca2 dissolution in soils thereby minimizing salinity injury due to ca2 na competition it may also reduce chloride salinity in the root zone because the nitrate can counterbalance the excess of chloride xu et al 1999 the dynamic of soil salinity and crop production were affected by combination of irrigation amount nitrogen application rate and irrigation water quality in 2018 significant effect of three factor interactions among i n and q was found in ssa from the squaring stage to the flower boll stage nui nue and water consumption during the whole growth period considering the interactions of water fertilizer and salt the combination of 75 etc and 255 kg ha 1 for brackish water irrigation is recommended which can control soil salinity effectively and did not cause a substantial yield reduction as well as increase water productivity of cotton the combination of 125 etc and 375 kg ha 1 for groundwater irrigation is suggested which produced the highest lint yield and wp other factors including soil salt ion meteorological conditions and crop varieties etc were not considered in this study and the suitable management considering economic inputs and incomes environmental impacts soil fertility crop yields etc will be studied in further research 5 conclusions main conclusions drawn from this research are 1 either increasing irrigation amount during the squaring stage or decreasing irrigation amount during the flower boll stage can alleviate the ssa higher brackish water irrigation amount reducing the ssa required more nitrogen applied during the flower boll stage appropriate water and nitrogen stress can alleviate the inter annual ssa under brackish water irrigation 2 brackish water irrigation produced lower nui water consumption and lint yield by 3 6 4 7 and 8 11 than groundwater irrigation the higher irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate significantly produced a higher nui and lint yield and the water consumption increased significantly with the increasing of irrigation amount and the decreasing of nitrogen application rate 3 fertigation with higher groundwater and nitrogen amount produced higher lint yield and water productivity fertigation schedule with irrigation amount of 125 etc and nitrogen application rate of 375 kg ha 1 for groundwater and 75 etc and 255 kg ha 1 for brackish water is recommended in this study area credit authorship contribution statement zheng che field experiment formal analysis writing

10202,understanding the interaction effects of water fertilizer and salinity is of great environmental importance to mitigate soil salinization and improve crop production field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of water quality irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on soil salt accumulation root water and nitrogen uptake lint yield and water productivity during 2018 and 2019 growing seasons of cotton gossypium hirsutum l in arid region of xinjiang china four irrigation levels 75 100 125 and 150 of crop water requirement etc and four nitrogen levels 195 255 315 and 375 kg ha 1 were applied with groundwater and brackish water irrigation results demonstrated that brackish water irrigation significantly increased the root zone soil salt accumulation ssa either increasing irrigation amount during the squaring stage or decreasing irrigation amount during the flower boll stage with higher nitrogen application rate can reduce the ssa and with an increase in brackish water irrigation amount a corresponding increase in nitrogen application rate is required to reduce the possible soil salt accumulation during the flower boll stage highest irrigation amount 150 etc and nitrogen application rate 375 kg ha 1 at the flower boll stage and during the whole growing season resulted in significant higher nitrogen uptake increment with an increasing rate of 25 74 and 39 65 respectively the integration of higher irrigation amount and highest nitrogen application rate with groundwater irrigation produced higher lint yield and water productivity considering soil salinity and lint yield as well as water productivity the appropriate integration modes of water and nitrogen are higher irrigation amount and highest nitrogen application rate 125 etc and 375 kg ha 1 for groundwater and lowest irrigation amount and lower nitrogen application rate 75 etc and 255 kg ha 1 for brackish water keywords fertigation soil salt accumulation water consumption lint yield water productivity 1 introduction mulched drip irrigation has been commonly used since 1990s for cotton cultivation in xinjiang uygur autonomous region china zhang et al 2014 melting glaciers are the sole water source in tarim basin in xinjiang one of the driest areas in the world jiang et al 2005 the scarcity of fresh water has strictly restricted the growth of agricultural production moreover the contradiction between water supply and demand caused by the rise in cotton planting areas has led to extreme water shortages guo and shen 2016 however widespread shallow brackish water with total dissolved solids above 2 3 g l 1 exhibited great potential for agricultural irrigation to compensate for the lack of available fresh water in these regions wang et al 2011 indeed such brackish water has been effectively applied with proper irrigation and fertigation management practices in cotton planting yasuor et al 2020 meanwhile the improper management of fertigation brackish and fresh water in israel egypt and usa has induced the secondary salinization in cotton field burt et al 2003 soil salinity is the most damaging environmental stress which contribute to major reductions in cultivated land area crop productivity and quality yamaguchi and blumwald 2005 therefore urgent measures are required to further increase the understanding of this issue and improve irrigation and fertigation management for cotton with groundwater and brackish water salinity control strategies generally aim to mitigate the salts accumulation in the root zone to levels that not restrict the root water uptake the appropriate irrigation and fertigation management is an option to alleviate the negative effects of salinity on crop development wang et al 2013 indicated the medium irrigation quota 295 mm produced lower salt content in the 0 60 cm soil layer jiang et al 2019 reported that the nitrogen application rate of 180 270 kg ha 1 at soil moisture levels of 100 and 90 field capacity did not cause salt accumulation in the soil root zone in addition the interaction between water quality and irrigation amount has a certain effect on soil salinity the application of low saline water with increasing irrigation amount alleviated soil salinity while increased under high saline water brackish water wang et al 2015 ahmed et al 2012 reported that irrigation with saline water of 7 5dsm 1 had significantly increased the soil salinity as well as excessive application of nitrogen n release higher quantity of base cations to soil solution accelerating soil salinization han et al 2014 in turn the elevated soil salinity inhibits the root nitrogen uptake min et al 2014 indicated that soil salinity increased slightly as the rate of nitrogen application increased especially in brackish and saline water irrigation therefore it can be concluded that the effects of irrigation and fertigation as well as water quality on soil salinity dynamic are complicated previous research mainly focused on single or interactions of multi factors i e water quality irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate there is still little information on the interaction of three factors on soil salt accumulation irrigation water quality and irrigation amount as well as nitrogen application rate significantly affected the change of soil salinity in root zone and thus influencing the crop growth mahmoodi eshkaftaki and rafiee 2020 hu et al 2012 reported that when cotton was irrigated with saline water greater than 2 24 g l 1 the salt is accumulated and the root weight density for treatments irrigated with fresh water was clearly greater than that irrigated with brackish water or saline water suitable irrigation strategy is of great importance for crop production under brackish water irrigation tan et al 2018 forkutsa et al 2009 suggested eight irrigations of total 580 mm with each time between 60 mm and 100 mm using brackish water were adequate to avoid notable plant water stress furthermore complex interactions exist among irrigation fertilizers soil salinity and crop performance in drip irrigated fields min et al 2016 chen et al 2010 reported that the cotton growth was significantly affected by interaction between soil salinity and nitrogen application rate higher application rate of nitrogen can alleviate the soil salinization salt stress effects machado and serralheiro 2017 resulting in increasing crop water consumption evapotranspiration and crop growth min et al 2014 bastida et al 2017 confirmed positive effects of regulated deficit irrigation with reclaimed water on plant productivity in semi arid area additional information about the interactive effects of water quality irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on soil salt accumulation and crop growth would be helpful for determining the irrigation and fertilization strategies for mulched drip irrigation with different water qualities the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the effects of water quality irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on soil salt accumulation nitrogen uptake increment water consumption and lint yield of cotton and 2 to develop an appropriate irrigation and fertigation management practices for different water qualities through considering the root zone soil salt accumulation crop yield and water productivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field the field experiments were conducted at the soil and water conservation monitoring station of the first

was calculated by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 by a crop coefficient kc which was adjusted according to yang et al 2016 2 3 irrigation and fertigation schedule different water qualities were used for irrigation approximately every 7 days from the squaring to the flower boll stage which was a total of 10 times in 2018 and 12 times in 2019 basal nitrogen fertilizer was applied at rate of 75 kg ha 1 and 120 kg ha 1 before seeding in 2018 and 2019 respectively the remained dosage was fertigated through mulched drip irrigation systems according to a ratio of 3 4 3 during squaring early flowering boll and late flowering boll stages fig 2 the dissolved urea was applied into each field plot using a proportional pump mis rite model 2504 tefen following a strategy of 1 4 w 1 2 n 1 4 w that was recommended by li et al 2004 the actual irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate are shown in fig 2 2 4 samplings and measurements 2 4 1 measurements of soil water contents time domain reflectometer trime fm imko gmbh ettlingen germany was used to monitor the soil volumetric water content one day before and one day after each irrigation event in both seasons access tubes with length of 120 cm were installed in each plot as shown in fig 1 soil water content was measured at 10 cm intervals down to 100 cm in addition soil samples were collected using a soil drill at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm at soil sampling points fig 1 within all plots of each treatment and soil water content measured by gravimetric method with one day before and two days after each fertigation event was used to check the trime fm data 2 4 2 measurements of soil salt contents and soil salt accumulation chen et al 2018 stated that cotton roots were mainly located within the top 0 40 cm of soil therefore the top 0 40 cm soil layer was considered as the main root zone of cotton in the following analysis soil samples at depths of 0 20 20 40 cm were selected to measured soil salt content for each sample 10 g of air dried soil passing through a 2 mm sieve were extracted with 50 ml of deionized water and soil conductivity namely ec1 5 were determined using a portable conductivity meter mettler toledo f3 standard mettler toledo company switzerland the dynamic change of soil salinity was described using the values of soil salt content a water bath heating method was used to calibrate the soil salt content and ec1 5 dsm 1 yielding the following equation 1 s 5 1367 c n 55 r 2 0 969 where s is soil salt content gkg 1 and c is the ec1 5 of soil samples dsm 1 root zone soil salt accumulation ssa was calculated as the difference between the content of salinity at the end and beginning of each given growth stage the soil salt content before sowing was 3 55 g kg 1 in 2018 and 3 86 g kg 1 in 2019 when ssa is positive it means salt accumulated in the top 0 40 cm of soil and if negative the desalination occurred 2 4 3 measurements of plant nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency at each sampling location three selected plants three rows cotton of semi mulch in 2018 and six selected plants six rows cotton of semi mulch i e increasing the number of samples to reduce sample error in 2019 were collected by clipping the aboveground plant at the seedling stage the squaring stage the flower boll stage and the mature stage the plant samples were air dried and weighed to determine the aboveground plant biomass then the total n content of the plant samples was measured using a kjeltec analyzer kjeltec 2300 foss denmark the plant n uptake was determined by the product of the aboveground plant biomass and the n content the nitrogen uptake increment nui was calculated as the difference between the content of n uptake at the end and beginning of each given growth stage to quantify the proportion of crop nitrogen uptake in the total source of nitrogen the following nitrogen use efficiency nue parameter was calculated for each treatment in this study referred to tian et al 2020 2 n u e t n f n s n i n a n where tn is total plant nitrogen uptake kgha 1 fn is total nitrogen application rates kgha 1 sn is soil total

covered with plastic mulch 2 4 4 measurements of lint yield and water productivity for each sample location the seed cotton was collected along six central 2 m long rows and the total weight of the six rows was used to represent the yield for this location the seed cotton samples for each plot were weighed and 50 g sub samples were ginned to determine the lint percentage the lint yield for each sample location was determined by multiplying the lint percentage by the respective seed cotton weight the crop water consumption was represented by the actual evapotranspiration et a mm calculated using the following water balance equation allen et al 1998 3 e t a i p e d p r o f f δ s where i is the irrigation amount mm p e is the effective rainfall mm d p is the deep percolation mm which was neglected due to low value of deep percolation under mulched drip irrigation zhang et al 2017 r off is runoff mm which was also ignored due to the weak topographic variations in this field and the low rainfall and irrigation intensity and δs is the variation in soil water storage mm in the 0 1 0 m soil layers between the initial and terminal stages therefore et a can be described as 4 e t a i p e δ

nui water consumption lint yield and wp at the probability levels of 0 05 or 0 01 duncan s multiple range tests were calculated at the level of 0 05 for significantly different main effects it should be pointed out that since i2 was only treated under groundwater irrigation therefore all treatments at the level of i2 were excluded in the significance analysis these statistical tests were performed

and 5 appropriate irrigation scheduling at squaring and flower boll stages can effectively reduce the soil salt accumulation at the squaring stage increasing irrigation amount can reduce the ssa when using groundwater irrigation the ssa for the 125 etc i3 and 100 etc i2 level at the squaring stage in 2018 was 52 and 75 lower than that for the 75 etc i1 level and the desalination i e the ssa changing from 0 6 g kg 1 to 0 05 g kg 1 occurred with increasing of irrigation amount from i1 to i3 under brackish water irrigation when increasing the upper limit of irrigation amount to 150 etc i4 in 2019 the i4 level produced the negative values of ssa of 0 6 g kg 1 and 0 1 g kg 1 under groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively at the flower boll stage of cotton decreasing irrigation amount reduced the ssa when using groundwater irrigation the desalination occurred with i1 and i3 levels in 2018 and in 2019 with the decreasing of irrigation amount from i4 to i2 the ssa changed from 0 2 g kg 1 to 1 6 g kg 1 for brackish water irrigation the decreasing rate of ssa was 78 and 25 as the irrigation amount decreased from i3 to i1 in 2018 and i4 to i3 in 2019 respectively nitrogen application rate produced a significant effect on the ssa at the mature stage in 2018 and during squaring to flower boll stages in 2019 tables 4 and 5 at the squaring stage in 2018 with the increasing nitrogen application rate from f1 to f2 and from f2 to f3 under brackish water irrigation the decreasing rate of the ssa was 35 and 54 respectively while medium nitrogen application rate f2 produced the lower ssa by 58 84 under groundwater irrigation similar result was found in 2019 the ssa of f2 level was negative with both groundwater and brackish water irrigation at the squaring stage at the flower boll stage higher nitrogen application rate of f3 and f4 reduced the ssa under groundwater irrigation when using brackish water irrigation the nitrogen application rate of f4 produced the lower ssa by 95 and 97 than f3 and f2 respectively at the mature stage in 2018 the highest nitrogen application rate f3 significantly reduced the ssa by 49 99 irrigation water quality produced a significant effect on the ssa at the flower boll stage and the whole growth stage of cotton both in 2018 and 2019 tables 4 and 5 irrigation with brackish water significantly increased the ssa from 0 2 to 1 5 g kg 1 to 2 1 5 1 g kg 1 at the flower boll stage the ssa ranged from 0 35 0 26 g kg 1 and 0 75 3 38 g kg 1 under groundwater and brackish water respectively during the whole growing season irrigation with brackish water significantly produced the higher ssa by 141 and 422 for irrigation amount of i1 and i3 respectively in 2018 and by 109 and 15 times of i3 and i4 respectively in 2019 irrigation water quality is the extremely important factor in salt accumulation and an appropriate irrigation amount can control the ssa under brackish water irrigation there was a significant interaction effect between irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on the ssa at the flower boll stage in 2018 and the whole growth stage in 2018 and in 2019 tables 4 and 5 at the flower boll stage in 2018 when using groundwater irrigation with lowest irrigation amount of i1 medium nitrogen application rate of f2 reduced the ssa down to desalination at 2 2 g kg 1 however with the irrigation amount increasing to i3 nitrogen application rate of f3 can reduce the ssa by 3 7 g kg 1 when using brackish water irrigation the combinations of lowest irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate i1f1s and highest irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate i3f3s reduced the ssa by 5 0 5 6 g kg 1 and 50 61 this indicated that with an increase of irrigation amount a corresponding increase in nitrogen application rate is required to reduce the possible soil salt accumulation a significant interaction effect between irrigation amount and irrigation water quality on the ssa was found at the flower boll stage in 2018 table 4 when using groundwater irrigation increasing irrigation amount to i3 produced the desalination at 0 4 g kg 1 however when using brackish water irrigation i3 increased the ssa by 353 this indicated that with an increase of brackish water irrigation amount the salinity brought into the root zone by irrigation water is greater than the salinity leached from the root zone we also discovered a significant interaction effect between nitrogen application rate and irrigation water quality on the ssa at the mature stage in 2018 and at the squaring stage in 2019 tables 4 and 5 at the mature stage in 2018 decreasing nitrogen application rate to f1 reduced the ssa by 12 78 with groundwater irrigation however when using brackish water f1 increased the ssa by 229 544 at the squaring stage in 2019 the treatment of i4f4s produced the significantly higher ssa with brackish water irrigation but no significant differences were found among the treatments of i4f2g i4f3g and i4f4g this indicated that appropriate nitrogen applied increase can produce lower ssa under brackish water irrigation but excessive nitrogen applied would aggravate soil salt accumulation significant interaction effect among irrigation amount nitrogen application rate and irrigation water quality was found during squaring to flower boll stages in 2018 and during the whole growth stage in 2019 tables 4 and 5 considering the sustainable impact of irrigation and fertilization on the soil environment during the whole growing season of cotton in two years the combinations of medium irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate 100 etc and 315 kg ha 1 for groundwater irrigation and lowest irrigation amount and medium nitrogen application rate 75 etc and 255 kg ha 1 for brackish water irrigation can achieve the goal of fresh water saving and salt control for environment friendly agriculture 3 2 plant nitrogen uptake increment the nui and nue during the 2018 and 2019 seasons are presented in tables 6 and 7 the nue roughly reflects the change rule of nui during the whole growth period the anova results showed that the irrigation amount produced a significant effect on nui during the flower boll stage and the whole growth stage in 2019 table 7 a significant effect on nue was also found in 2019 table 7 the highest irrigation amount produced a higher nui and nue with both groundwater and brackish water irrigation in 2019 when using groundwater irrigation the nui of i4 was greater than that of i3 and i2 by 48 and 67 25 and 25 at the flower boll stage and the whole growth stage respectively and the nui of i4 was greater than that of i3 by 74 and 37 with brackish water irrigation in 2019 meanwhile irrigation amount i4 produced the higher nue by 23 36 no significant effect was found in 2018 table 6 however the nui of lowest irrigation amount of i1 is greater than that of i3 by 7 with brackish water irrigation at the flower boll stage which is largely depending on the lower ssa produced by the lowest irrigation amount fertilization is a strategy to minimize soil salt accumulation and thus to promote plant growth the anova results also showed that the highest nitrogen application rate produced a significant higher nui in both two years and higher nue in 2019 tables 6 and 7 in 2018 the nui of f3 was significantly greater than that of f2 and f1 by 7 and 39 32 and 8 with groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively at the whole growth stage and in 2019 the nui of f4 was significantly greater than that of f3 and f2 by 17 65 and 10 104 since the flower boll stage meanwhile nitrogen application rate f4 produced the higher nue by 35 46 and 4 11 with groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively it indicated that total n uptake increased with the increasing of nitrogen fertilizer application rate at lower soil salinity environment the irrigation water quality presented a significant effect on nui and nue at the whole growth stage in 2019 table 7 the nui and nue with the groundwater irrigation were greater than that of brackish water irrigation by 6 in the process of brackish water irrigation more salt is brought into the soil and the salt reduces the permeability of the soil and soil water potential thus affecting the nitrogen uptake of crops there was a significant interaction effect between nitrogen application rate and irrigation water quality on the nui during flower boll and whole growth stages in both 2018 and 2019 tables 6 and 7 at the flower boll stage in 2018 the medium nitrogen application rate of f2 produced the higher nui by 39 and 60 under groundwater irrigation of i1 while the nui of f3 was 26 and 98 greater than f1 and f2 using brackish water irrigation respectively similarly the highest nitrogen application rate of f3 produced a higher and lower nui under groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively with irrigation amount of i3 in 2019 the highest nitrogen application rate of f4 under groundwater irrigation produced a higher nui by 9 164 however f4 produced the lower nui by 23 and 26 than f3 and f2 under brackish water irrigation this indicated that increasing nitrogen application promoted crop growth while those effects are decreased with irrigation water salinity increasing significant interaction effects of i f in 2019 and i q and i f q in 2018 during flower boll and whole growth stages were also found tables 6 and 7 at the flower boll stage in 2019 the treatment of i3f4s produced a lower nui than that of i3f3s and i3f2s by 23 and 26 but the nui of treatment of i4f4s was greater than i4f3s and i4f2s by 79 and 33 it showed that high n application under brackish water irrigation can promote crop growth with higher irrigation support in 2018 the highest irrigation amount of i3 under groundwater irrigation produced a higher nui by 95 than i1 with nitrogen application rate of f3 but i1 produced a higher nui under brackish water irrigation by 49 than i3 it indicated that deficit irrigation 75 etc i1 alleviated soil salt accumulation and thus promoted the growth of crops under brackish water irrigation considering the interactions of i f q the highest nui and nue were obtained by the fertigation combination of 100 etc and 315 kg ha 1 for groundwater water irrigation and the fertigation combination of 75 etc and 315 kg ha 1 for brackish water irrigation 3 3 water consumption the water consumption during the 2018 and 2019 seasons are shown in table 8 the anova results indicated that the irrigation amount produced a significant effect on water consumption at the flower boll stage and the whole growth stage the highest irrigation amount generally produced higher water consumption the irrigation amount of i3 in 2018 produced higher water consumption by 6 42 than i2 and i1 under groundwater irrigation and by 43 47 than i1 under brackish water irrigation similarly in 2019 the water consumption of i4 was greater than that of i3 and i2 by 23 44 that of i3 by 14 18 under groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively in addition the nitrogen application rate produced a significant effect on water consumption at the flower boll stage in 2018 and 2019 table 8 the lowest nitrogen application level generally produced higher water consumption with the increase of nitrogen application rate the water consumption was presented a decreasing trend in 2018 while a first decreasing and then increasing trend in 2019 the water consumption at the flower boll stage under the lowest nitrogen application level of f1 were greater than f2 and f3 by 6 and 13 in 2018 while f2 were greater than f3 and f4 by 15 and 7 in 2019 the irrigation water quality produced a significant effect on water consumption at the whole growth stage table 8 the water consumption for groundwater irrigation was greater than brackish water irrigation by 7 and 4 in 2018 and 2019 there was a significant interaction effect between irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate on the water consumption at the flower boll stage and the whole growth stage in 2018 table 8 the nitrogen application rate of f2 produced the higher and lower water consumption under i1 and i3 respectively resulting in an increasing rate of 5 27 and a decreasing rate of 8 15 this indicated that medium nitrogen application rate of f2 promoted root water uptake largely depending on the lower ssa significant interaction effects of i q at the squaring stage in 2018 and at the whole growth stage in 2019 and i f q during whole growth stage in 2018 were also found table 8 at the squaring stage in 2018 the groundwater irrigation produced the higher water consumption by 9 under lowest irrigation amount i1 however the groundwater irrigation produced the lower water consumption by 19 under higher irrigation amount i3 similarly at the whole growth stage in 2019 the difference of water consumption between groundwater and brackish water irrigation was below 1 under i3 but with highest irrigation amount i4 the water consumption for groundwater irrigation was greater than brackish water irrigation by 8 this indicated that an appropriate irrigation amount can alleviate the salt stress caused by brackish water irrigation and improve the root water uptake considering the interactions of i f q the treatment of i3f1g and i3f3s produced the highest water consumption under groundwater and brackish water irrigation respectively 3 4 lint yield and water productivity the cotton lint yield and water productivity during the 2018 and 2019 seasons are presented in fig 3 the anova results showed that the irrigation amount produced a significant effect on lint yield and water productivity in 2018 table 9 the highest irrigation level i3 in 2018 generally produced a higher lint yield the increase rates were 12 and 30 than i2 and i1 with groundwater irrigation and 12 than i1 with brackish water irrigation with upper limit of irrigation level increasing to 150 etc i4 in 2019 there was a 3 increase of yield the water productivity decreased significantly with the increasing of irrigation amount fig 3 and table 9 the decreasing rate was 6 24 and 9 16 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the nitrogen application rate produced significant effects on lint yield and water productivity in 2019 table 9 the highest nitrogen application level of f4 produced the largest lint yield and water productivity compared with the f2 and f3 level the increase rates of lint yield were 9 and 13 and the increase rates of water productivity were 6 and 17 however no significant effect on lint yield and water productivity was found in 2018 it also can be presented that the medium nitrogen application rate f2 produced the higher lint yield by 11 12 and higher water productivity by 5 8 a significant effect of irrigation water quality on lint yield was observed in 2018 and 2019 table 9 the lint yield under brackish water irrigation was significantly lower by 11 and 8 during the 2018 and 2019 seasons while no significant effect of irrigation water quality on water productivity was found no significant effects of pairwise interactions and three factor interactions among i n and q on lint yield and water productivity were found in both seasons table 9 when using groundwater irrigation the combination of treatment of i3f2g produced the highest lint yield in 2018 and the treatment of i3f4g produced the highest lint yield and wp in 2019 however no significant differences of lint yield were found among the treatments under brackish water irrigation fig 3 the combination treatment of i3f2g produced the highest lint yield in 2018 but the lint yield reduced by 24 in 2019 largely depending on the ssa increased by 41 fig 3 and table 5 considering lint yield and water productivity as well as the ssa of two years the obtained optimum combinations of water and nitrogen are 125 etc and 375 kg ha 1 for groundwater irrigation and 75 etc and 255 kg ha 1 for brackish water irrigation the lint yield water productivity and ssa are 4127 kg ha 1 9 915 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 1 454 g kg 1 and 3227 kg ha 1 8 956 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 1 832 g kg 1 respectively 4 discussion in this study the interaction effect of irrigation amount and water quality on ssa nui water consumption lint yield and water productivity is complicated due to that both groundwater and brackish water contain some soluble salt ions which would accumulate in the root zone of cotton after irrigation previous studies indicated that the soil salt accumulation increased gradually with increase of irrigation water salinity and decrease of irrigation water amount yuan et al 2019 in 2018 a significant interaction effect of irrigation amount and water quality was observed in ssa and nui at the flower boll stage nue during the whole growth period lower and higher irrigation amount i1 and i3 decreased the ssa to desalination with groundwater and increased the ssa with brackish water mostafazadeh fard et al 2007 also reported that leaching can decrease soil salinity to desalination effectively by improving the quality of irrigation water with groundwater irrigation amount increasing the nui and lint yield increased by 27 and 30 under lower soil salt environment guan et al 2013 also reported that a higher irrigation level under low water salinity produced a significantly greater plant nitrogen uptake since the flower boll stage when brackish water irrigation amount were increasing the salinity brought into the root zone by irrigation water is greater than the salinity leached from the root zone the brought salinity contains a lager of soluble salt ions especially na cl and so4 2 table 2 which can destroy the mineral nutrition balance in crop body and cause the disorder of cell metabolism mansour 1994 accordingly deficit irrigation 75 etc i1 alleviated soil salt accumulation produced higher nui and water productivity under brackish water irrigation by 7 and 31 than i3 the loss of nui happened at the highest irrigation amount demonstrated that the increased amount of irrigation water could not compensate the inhibition of the brought salinity which are in accordance with research of jiang et al 2012 also these results further strengthened the previous conclusion that using brackish water may increase the risk of soil salinization and thus significantly affected the uptake of nutrients by the plant mostafazadeh fard et al 2007 chakraborty et al 2016 therefore when irrigated with water containing a certain amount of salt the irrigation amount and water quality should be coupled reasonably appropriately increasing nitrogen application rate can mitigate salt stress and promote crop growth zeng et al 2015 ma et al 2017 significant interaction effect of nitrogen application rate and irrigation water quality was found in ssa at the squaring and mature stage nui and nue during the whole growth period nitrogen application significantly increased cotton nitrogen uptake under fresh and brackish water irrigation hou et al 2010 compared with f1 medium nitrogen application rate f2 with groundwater irrigation reduced the ssa by 25 63 increased the nui by 30 and produced higher lint yield and water productivity by 7 17 and 4 20 respectively however the nitrification of excess nitrogen fertilizers led to a large release of protons and soil acidification further induced the direct release of base cations to soil solution accelerating soil salinization han et al 2014 whereas when using brackish water irrigation nitrogen application rate increased to f3 and f4 can reduce the ssa by 49 84 increase the nui by 3 44 and thus produce higher lint yield by 2 5 high soil salinity inhibited the growth and n uptake of cotton mainly through osmotic stress nutritional imbalance and specific ion toxicity alam 1999 jacoby 1994 munns and tester 2008 one explanation of nitrogen application mitigating salt stress is that nitric acid applied with fertigation reduces soil ph and increases ca2 dissolution in soils thereby minimizing salinity injury due to ca2 na competition it may also reduce chloride salinity in the root zone because the nitrate can counterbalance the excess of chloride xu et al 1999 the dynamic of soil salinity and crop production were affected by combination of irrigation amount nitrogen application rate and irrigation water quality in 2018 significant effect of three factor interactions among i n and q was found in ssa from the squaring stage to the flower boll stage nui nue and water consumption during the whole growth period considering the interactions of water fertilizer and salt the combination of 75 etc and 255 kg ha 1 for brackish water irrigation is recommended which can control soil salinity effectively and did not cause a substantial yield reduction as well as increase water productivity of cotton the combination of 125 etc and 375 kg ha 1 for groundwater irrigation is suggested which produced the highest lint yield and wp other factors including soil salt ion meteorological conditions and crop varieties etc were not considered in this study and the suitable management considering economic inputs and incomes environmental impacts soil fertility crop yields etc will be studied in further research 5 conclusions main conclusions drawn from this research are 1 either increasing irrigation amount during the squaring stage or decreasing irrigation amount during the flower boll stage can alleviate the ssa higher brackish water irrigation amount reducing the ssa required more nitrogen applied during the flower boll stage appropriate water and nitrogen stress can alleviate the inter annual ssa under brackish water irrigation 2 brackish water irrigation produced lower nui water consumption and lint yield by 3 6 4 7 and 8 11 than groundwater irrigation the higher irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate significantly produced a higher nui and lint yield and the water consumption increased significantly with the increasing of irrigation amount and the decreasing of nitrogen application rate 3 fertigation with higher groundwater and nitrogen amount produced higher lint yield and water productivity fertigation schedule with irrigation amount of 125 etc and nitrogen application rate of 375 kg ha 1 for groundwater and 75 etc and 255 kg ha 1 for brackish water is recommended in this study area credit authorship contribution statement zheng che field experiment formal analysis writing

erosion control and water resource are both important in the present study six years 2014 2019 of runoff and soil loss data from 19 runoff plots in the upstream catchment of the miyun reservoir in beijing the capital of china were employed to do this work results indicated that runoff and soil loss from the plots differed greatly depending on land use soil conservation measure and slope degree bare and cultivated plots without any soil conservation measures suffered the highest soil loss rate of over 3000 t km 2 yr 1 with higher runoff depth followed by grass plots 1274 1 t km 2 yr 1 orchard plots 127 2 t km 2 yr 1 and shrub plots 65 3 t km 2 yr 1 h and slr approached zero on the forest plots over 80 of the sediment and runoff were intercepted by shrub grass and terraced plots with slrs much less than the soil tolerance value i e 200 t km 2 yr 1 in the study region contour tillage plots on gentle slope can also intercept over 90 sediment while allowing most of the generated runoff to run downslope implementation of soil conservation measures must be cautious in the study area water saving soil conservation measures should be given priority to in the study region contour tillage should be promoted on gentle slopes and terrace size should be considered on different slopes when it is implemented the vegetation coverage such as forest shrub and grass should be lesser to release more runoff downslope soil conservation measures are still required on bare and cultivated slopes this study can help to implement reasonable soil conservation measures in this and similar regions in the world keywords runoff plot runoff soil loss reduction efficiency northern china 1 introduction soil erosion is one of the key environmental problems inducing both on site land degradation and off site sediment siltation water quality and water resource use damnati et al 2013 anache et al 2017 borrelli et al 2017 wuepper et al 2020 soil erosion can thus directly and indirectly influence water soil and other earth surface processes therefore implementation of soil conservation measures must be cautious since it can also alter hydrological geochemical biological and ecological cycles decock et al 2015 anache et al 2017 runoff plot is one kind of traditional methods to study water erosion based on this method a lot of studies have been conducted to determine soil loss and surface runoff over the last century garcía ruiz et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 evaluations of land use soil conservation measures huang et al 2006 wei et al 2007 wang et al 2016 rainfall characteristics kinnell 2005 fang et al 2008 fortugno et al 2017 and slope characteristics fang et al 2015 fang et al 2017 on runoff and soil loss have been conducted in different regions of the world and the mechanisms of different measures to conserve water and soil were well understood chen et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 however most of the conducted studies focus on the control functions of runoff and soil loss by these measures neglecting their effect on local downstream water resource use li et al 2008 the miyun reservoir is one of the most important drinking water sources for the people in beijing he et al 2015 han et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 and around 70 drinking water is provided by this reservoir zhang 2008 the water quality and quantity of the reservoir have been received much attention by local government and scientists before 2000 annual sediment amount that entered the reservoir from the chaohe river one of the two major tributaries in the upstream of the reservoir was up to 9 08 105 tons resulting in severe sediment siltation in the reservoir li 2007 ma et al 2010 to control soil loss soil conservation measures such as contour tillage terracing and reforestation have been implemented since the 1970s in this region and sediment discharged into the reservoir has been zero in some years since 2005 li 2007 however affected by these intensive anthropogenic activities and lasting dry years runoff flowing into the reservoir also decreased sharply threatening drinking water safety for the people in beijing wang et al 2016 yan et al 2019 pang et al 2020 similar phenomenon also occurred on the chinese loess plateau where dry soil layers and unexpected water shortage in downstream catchment occurred due to irrational soil conservation measures jia et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 in the upstream catchment of the miyun reservoir the characteristics of water and soil loss and their responses to soil conservation measures were analyzed using runoff plot cai 2001 wang et al 2001 he et al 2015 gao 2018 and water erosion models feng et al 2019 qiu et al 2018 pang et al 2020 however the conducted studies mainly focused on soil loss control function of the measures scarcely considering water resource shortage in downstream area caused by the implemented soil control measures li et al 2008 this contradiction must be resolved and studies on soil conservation measures on runoff and soil loss should be further conducted to guide measures implementation therefore runoff and soil loss data from 20 runoff plots in the upstream catchment of the miyun reservoir northern china were used as a case study to i explore the effects of land use and soil conservation measures on runoff and soil loss ii compare their runoff and soil loss reduction efficiencies and finally iii give suggestions to implement soil conservation measures in this and similar regions of the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the shixia catchment e117 4 30 and 40 34 40 n in the upstream of the miyun reservoir fig 1 the catchment has a drainage surface of 33 km2 with a temperate territorial monsoon climate the annual precipitation varied from 331 mm to 615 mm in 2007 2019 70 of which falls from june to august the elevation of the catchment ranges from 130 to 390 m a s l the lithology is dominated by gneiss scattered with granite and limestone the soil was developed on alluvial and diluvial parent materials robinia pseudoacacia pinus tabulaeformis and economic forest are the major vegetation the predominant crops are corn and wheat the sandy loam soil contains around 60 9 particles larger than 0 05 mm in diameter 18 22 particles with 0 05 0 005 mm in diameter 9 22 particles with 0 005 0 001 mm in diameter and 14 88 particles less than 0 001 mm in diameter wang et al 2001 2 2 runoff plots there are 22 runoff plots in the catchment fig 1 the boundaries of each plot were made of bricks and cement to prevent runoff from leaving or entering the plot the plots are bare covered with different soil conservation measures such as contour tillage terracing grass and forest measures in order to exclude the effect of slope length on runoff and soil loss 19 plots were selected in the present study each selected plot was 50 m2 in area and 10 m in length the slope degrees of the plots ranged from 3 5 to 27 detailed information of the plots was given in table 1 2 3 data collection after each rainfall event in 2014 2019 surface runoff mixed with sediment was collected with a nine hole diversion bucket and a tank at the end of each runoff plot the runoff amount was then calculated evenly mixed water and sediment samples were collected with 1000 ml flasks after each rainfall and transported into the laboratory where they were oven dried and weighted to determine their sediment concentrations soil loss of each plot was calculated by multiplying the average sediment concentration and runoff amount the runoff depth h mm of runoff plot after each rainfall event was calculated by using total runoff amount and plot area soil loss rate slr t km 2 event 1 was obtained by using soil loss and plot area annual h and annual slr of each plot were obtained by summing the event derived ones rainfall information was recorded by a rain gauge and a rain barrel near the plots

statistical analysis pearson correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationships between h slr and their influencing factors fisher s protected least significant difference test was used to compare the means of hs and slrs from the plots treatments were considered significantly if p 0 05 all the statistics were conducted using spss version 14 0 for windows 3 results 3 1 characteristics of erosive rainfalls erosive rainfall describes the rainfall that induces soil loss fang et al 2017 in 2014 2019 annual rainfall amounts ranged from 410 mm in 2017 to 532 mm in 2018 and the percentages of erosive rainfall occupied over 50 of the ap there were seven to eleven erosive rainfall events each year with a total of 57 erosive rainfall events during the study period fig 2 the minimum and maximum ps were 4 8 mm and 108 10 mm with an average of 32 29 mm the rds ranged from 20 to 1940 min with an average of 402 min the minimum i30 and i60 were 6 00 and 3 60 mm h 1 and the maximum values were higher than 60 mm h 1 table 2 3 2 runoff surface event and annual hs from the 19 runoff plots in 2014 2019 were presented in fig 3 it was clear that they differed greatly depending on land use soil conservation measure and slope degree the annual hs ranged from 0 mm to 75 2 mm with significant difference at the 0 05 level among different land use types bare plots i e plots 3 and 4 had the highest average annual h of 71 24 mm followed by the cultivated plots i e plots 1 6 16 17 and 19 with an average annual h of 57 13 mm grass plots i e plots 14 and 15 of 12 95 mm shrub plots i e plots 5 9 12 13 and 18 of 9 83 mm and orchard plots i e plots 2 and 7 of 5 49 mm during the study period runoff did not occurred on forest plots 8 and 10 and forest plot 11 had the lowest annual h of 5 17 mm among each land use type steeper slopes yielded higher annual h although their differences were not significantly at the 0 05 level for example plot 3 had higher annual h compared to plot 4 and plot 6 had the highest annual h among the cultivated plots with soil conservation measures for the plots treated with orchard and terrace higher annual h occurred on plot 2 than that on plot 7 with an exception the steepest plot 9 had smaller annual h among the shrub plots surface hs also differed greatly ranging from 0 mm on plots 8 and 10 to 7 9 mm on plot 3 hs had similar distribution pattern to that of annual h on the 19 plots with significant differences among some land use types the highest h occurred on the bare plots followed by cultivated plots grass plots shrub plots orchard

of annual h and annual soil loss were induced by several rainfall events the largest runoff contribution of one event can be up to 100 and the smallest contribution was also larger than 22 fig 4 3 3 soil loss slrs from the plots had almost the same changing patterns to the hs at both annual and rainfall event scales mean annual slrs varied greatly ranging from zero on forest plots 8 and 10 to 4421 8 t km 2 on the bare plot 3 fig 5a mean annual slr decreased from 3634 5 t km 2 on bare plots 1274 1 t km 2 on cultivated plots 127 2 t km 2 on grass plots 86 5 t km 2 on orchard plots 65 3 t km

example in the respect of cultivated land with contour tillage the 14 4 plot 6 yielded a much higher slr than those gentler plots 17 and 19 a large amount of soil loss was also caused by a few rainfall events and the maximum soil loss contributions of one rainfall event to the annual total ranged from 42 to 100 on the plots figs 5 and 9 showed that higher soil loss contributions occurred on the plots with smaller slrs and vice versa for example soil loss contributions on plots 1 3 4 and 6 were lower compared to those on other plots 3 4 runoff soil loss relationship surface runoff was plotted against slr for each plot to visually show their relations because h and slr were greatly affected by land use soil conservation measure slope gradient and other factors the dots were widely

rainfall influencing runoff flow velocity on the ground and altering runoff infiltration capacity into soils sun et al 2006 zhou et al 2016 stratified vegetation community can effectively reduce runoff and soil loss compared with the mono species communities chen et al 2018 this can explain the least h and slr for the dense forest plots and the lower hs and slrs for the shrub orchard and grass plots fig 7 noticeably both surface runoff and slr on the cultivated and bare plots were not significantly different at the 0 05 level and h and slr on bare plot 4 were even lower than the counterparts on plot 1 figs 3 and 5 this seems impossible field investigation however confirmed its reasonability the plots were built in 1992 and a lot of fine particles of the bare plots have been flushed away during the past years resulting in coarse soil surface with many pebbles on the plot fig 7f the pebbles can thus reduce soil erodibility and decrease slr this phenomenon has well been studied e g jury and bellantuoni 1976 li et al 2001 peng et al 2016 in comparison although the cultivated plot was covered with corn the ground surface was bare and the canopy can amalgamate rainfall drops and increase raindrop size leading to larger kinetic energy and higher slr fig 7e geißler et al 2012 in comparison the ground cover including grass and litter layers is more efficient than canopy layer and smaller h and slr appeared on the plots covered with grass and shrub similar to other studies conducted in the loess plateau region zhao et al 2018 liang et al 2020 and other regions of china wen et al 2010 fang et al 2017 anache et al 2017 terrace is more efficient in controlling soil loss and runoff than contour tillage and vegetation measures such as shrub and grass fig 4 steep slope has a larger potential velocity of runoff deng et al 2020 however for the 19 plots averaged annual h and annual slr had no relations to slope degree because they were intensively affected by land use and soil conservation measures in addition changes in runoff and slr with slope degree also differed for a certain kind of land use for example on cultivated plots 6 17 and 19 with contour tillage h and slr were higher on steeper slopes table 1 fig 8 soil conservation measure in the study area played an important role for the plots with the same land use and proximate slope degree higher vegetation coverage or terraced ploted induced lower h and slr this agrees with global results zhao et al 2019 wuepper et al 2020 noticeably on shrub plots both h and slr had maximum values with threshold slope degree fig 8 the existence of threshold slope gradient has already been confirmed by some studies e g guo 1958 jin 1995 fang et al 2015 different land use types in combined with different soil conservation measures on the plots could mask the effect of slope degree on ah and annual slr rainfall is the external force inducing surface runoff and slr pearson correlation coefficients indicated that the h and slr on the cultivated and bare plots were both significantly correlated with p and rainfall intensity i30 and or i60 at the 0 01 level while the h and slr on terraced plots 2 and 7 were mainly significantly correlated with p at the 0 01 level table 4 however for plots covered with shrub and orchard h and slr were significantly correlated with p or rainfall intensity different responses of plots to different rainfall eigenvalues can result from the protection capacities of the measures jiao et al 2009 chen et al 2018 liang et al 2020 for example the correlation coefficients for the shrub and orchard plots were usually smaller than those on cultivated and bare plots implying the difference in protection function of soil conservation measures maetens et al 2012 chen et al 2018 the implemented soil conservation measures can greatly reduce soil loss with soil loss reduction efficiencies of above 90 on plots 7 18 and above 80 on plots 2 and 5 fig 9 most of these measures can also efficiently intercept runoff fig 9 however contour tillage plots 17 and 19 with gentle slope can allow more runoff to flow downslope on steep slopes the plots covered with grass and shrub and orchard with fish scale pits only released 10 30 runoff downslope water storage characterizes the study area ma et al 2010 intense interception of runoff by the implemented soil conservation measures in the study area has led to drinking water security in the study area wang et al 2016 yan et al 2019 pang et al 2020 however soil loss should also be controlled by soil conservation measures because soil erosion influences water quality of the study area qiu et al 2018 the contradiction between soil loss control and excessive water reduction induced by the measures can be resolved by implementing reasonable soil conservation measures because contour tillage can effectively control soil loss and allow runoff to run downslope fig 9 it should be given priority to on gentle slopes of the study area in comparison because the shrub and forest can reduce slr to far below the allowable value and completely prevent runoff from running downslope fig 8 they should be sparser to generate more runoff in the study area terracing land occupied over 17 of the cultivated lands and some terraced lands are still distributed on gentle slope gradients li et al 2008 its higher water reduction efficiency greatly decreased downstream runoff implying that the size of terrace should be carefully considered when it is implemented on different slopes chen et al 2017 therefore water saving measures that can not only control soil loss but also allow more runoff to run downslope are preferred in the study area the cultivated land without any soil conservation measures suffered severe soil loss and soil conservation measures still should be implemented on it in the study area 5 conclusions the effect of different land use with different soil conservation measures were carefully evaluated using six years of runoff and soil loss data from 19 runoff plots in the upstream catchment of the miyun reservoir this study found that surface runoff and soil loss were considerably affected by land use and soil conservation measures bare and cultivated land without any soil conservation measure suffered the most severe slr of above 3000 t km 2 yr 1 followed by steep slope with contour tillage and orchard plots the slr on shrub and grass plots was much less than the soil tolerance value of the study region i e 200 t km 2 the forestland or a combination of forestland with other vegetation yielded the lowest runoff and soil loss terrace can also intercept nearly 100 of runoff and sediment on gentle slope contour tillage on gentle slope can effectively control soil loss while allowing for more runoff to run downslope impacted by land use and soil conservation measures on the plots the effect of slope degree on mean annual h and slr was insignificant implementation of soil control measures should be cautious and water saving soil conservation measures should be given priority to in the study and similar regions in the world contour tillage should be promoted on gentle slopes and relatively sparse vegetation coverage on steep slopes can be a good way to resolve the contradiction of soil loss control and water shortage in downstream area the

beijing the capital of china were employed to do this work results indicated that runoff and soil loss from the plots differed greatly depending on land use soil conservation measure and slope degree

regions in the world keywords runoff plot runoff soil loss reduction efficiency northern china 1 introduction soil erosion is one of the key environmental problems inducing both on site land degradation and off site sediment siltation water quality and water resource use damnati et al 2013 anache et al 2017 borrelli et al 2017 wuepper et al 2020 soil erosion can thus directly and indirectly influence water soil and other earth surface processes therefore implementation of soil conservation measures must be cautious since it can also alter hydrological geochemical biological and ecological cycles decock et al 2015 anache et al 2017 runoff plot is one kind of traditional methods to study water erosion based on this method a lot of studies have been conducted to determine soil loss and surface runoff over the last century garcía ruiz et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 evaluations of land use soil conservation measures huang et al 2006 wei et al 2007 wang et al 2016 rainfall characteristics kinnell 2005 fang et al 2008 fortugno et al 2017 and slope characteristics fang et al 2015 fang et al 2017 on runoff and soil loss have been conducted in different regions of the world and the mechanisms of different measures to conserve water and soil were well understood chen et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 however most of the conducted studies focus on the control functions of runoff and soil loss by these measures neglecting their effect on local downstream water resource use li et al 2008 the miyun reservoir is one of the most important drinking water sources for the people in beijing he et al 2015 han et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 qiu et al 2020 and around 70 drinking water is provided by this reservoir zhang 2008 the water quality and quantity of the reservoir have been received much attention by local government and scientists before 2000 annual sediment amount that entered the reservoir from the chaohe river one of the two major tributaries in the upstream of the reservoir was up to 9 08 105 tons resulting in severe sediment siltation in the reservoir li 2007 ma et al 2010 to control soil loss soil conservation measures such as contour tillage terracing and reforestation have been implemented since the 1970s in this region and sediment discharged into the reservoir has been zero in some years since 2005 li 2007 however affected by these intensive anthropogenic activities and lasting dry years runoff flowing into the reservoir also decreased sharply threatening drinking water safety for the people in beijing wang et al 2016 yan et al 2019 pang et al 2020 similar phenomenon also occurred on the chinese loess plateau where dry soil layers and unexpected water shortage in downstream catchment occurred due to irrational soil conservation measures jia et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 in the upstream catchment of the miyun reservoir the characteristics of water and soil loss and their responses to soil conservation measures were analyzed using runoff plot cai 2001 wang et al 2001 he et al 2015 gao 2018 and water erosion models feng et al 2019 qiu et al 2018 pang et al 2020 however the conducted studies mainly focused on soil loss control function of the measures scarcely considering water resource shortage in downstream area caused by the implemented soil control measures li et al 2008 this contradiction must be resolved and studies on soil conservation measures on runoff and soil loss should be further conducted to guide measures implementation therefore runoff and soil loss data from 20 runoff plots in the upstream catchment of the miyun reservoir northern china were used as a case study to i explore the effects of land use and soil conservation measures on runoff and soil loss ii compare their runoff and soil loss reduction efficiencies and finally iii give suggestions to implement soil conservation measures in this and similar regions of the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was

annual precipitation varied from 331 mm to 615 mm in 2007 2019 70 of which falls from june to august the elevation of the catchment ranges from 130 to 390 m a s l the lithology is dominated by gneiss scattered with granite and limestone the soil was developed on alluvial and diluvial parent materials robinia pseudoacacia pinus tabulaeformis and economic forest are the major vegetation the

cement to prevent runoff from leaving or entering the plot the plots are bare covered with different soil conservation measures such as contour tillage terracing grass and forest measures in order to exclude the effect of slope length on runoff and soil loss 19 plots were selected in the present study each selected plot was 50 m2 in area and 10 m in length the slope degrees of the plots ranged from 3 5 to 27 detailed information of the plots was given in table 1 2 3 data collection after each rainfall event in 2014 2019 surface runoff mixed with sediment was collected with a nine hole diversion bucket and a tank at the end of each runoff plot the runoff amount was then calculated evenly mixed water and sediment samples were collected with 1000 ml flasks after each rainfall and transported into the laboratory where they were oven dried and weighted to determine their sediment concentrations soil loss of each plot was calculated by multiplying the average sediment concentration and runoff amount the runoff depth h mm of runoff plot after each rainfall event was calculated by using total runoff amount and plot area soil loss rate slr t km 2 event 1 was obtained

drip210 and drip150 achieved comparable grain yield but drip150 used 28 6 less nitrogen than drip210 resulted in 24 0 lower tnll and higher nue than drip210 in addition the average economic benefit under drip150 was the highest and increased by 397 and 1675 cny ha 1 respectively compared with drip210 and mfp therefore drip150 was recommended as a promising fertilization strategy to reduce nitrate leaching losses and improve nitrogen use efficiency while maintain high crop yield and economic benefit in northwest china keywords drip fertigation soil leachate nitrogen use efficiency sustainable agricultural 1 introduction nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients for plant growth however agricultural activities cultivation and harvest decrease total nitrogen contents of topsoil in the semiarid regions around the world dalal and mayer 1986 urioste et al 2006 to overcome the problem of nutrient deficiency and achieve high crop yield growers often apply a large amount of fertilizers in the farmland these behaviors have led to excessive nitrogen with improper time applied in agricultural production systems without considering their environmental consequences which has created a high risk of nitrate leaching below the root zone when intensive precipitation occurs during crop growth periods wei et al 2009 zhou et al 2018a in addition excessive nitrogen application also have resulted in low nitrogen use efficiency gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 and increased crop production costs hence a scientific nitrogen management strategy for improving nitrogen use efficiency and reducing nitrate leaching losses while maintaining high grain yield is imperative for the sustainable agricultural development the rotation of winter wheat and summer maize is a common cropping system in the semi humid and drought prone climate zone which plays a significant role in food supply in northwest china local farmers apply ca 500 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for achieving high grain yield of maize and wheat in the crop rotation system ju et al 2009 and about 60 of this total nitrogen is applied in the summer maize growing season jia et al 2014 in the region with this rotation system the annual precipitation is about 620 mm ding et al 2018 about 70 distributed from june to september summer maize growth periods fan et al 2010 therefore high nitrogen application with intensive precipitation aggravates the nitrate nitrogen leaching into a deep soil during the summer maize seasons which can increase the pollution risk of water resources and decrease nitrogen use efficiency yang et al 2015 reported that almost all nitrate leaching losses events caused by precipitation occurred during maize growth periods in the winter wheat and summer maize rotation system therefore the nitrogen use and nitrate leaching losses should be studied with great efforts during the summer maize growth period urea a nitrogen fertilizer commonly used in this area is hydrolyzed into ammonium after being applied to the soil which then quickly converted to nitrate azad et al 2019 nitrate is very soluble and can run off into the surface water or flow into the groundwater howden et al 2013 in this area the conventional nitrogen application strategy is to apply all nitrogen urea at sowing mid june intensive precipitation usually causes a large amount of nitrate leaching into the deep soil which always leads to insufficient nitrogen in the soil to meet the crop demand in the late seasons zhou et al 2018a fernandez et al 2020 therefore conventional fertilization strategy is always associated with low nitrogen use efficiency water use efficiency and yield as well as high nitrate leaching risk nitrate leaching losses mainly depends on the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in the soil solution and the amount of soil leachate cameron et al 2013 the residual amount of nitrate in the soil depends on the rate of nitrogen application and plant uptake di and cameron 2000 reported that there were quadratic relationships between the potentially leachable nitrogen mineral n and readily mineralisable n and annual leaching losses in the soil only negligible amount of fertilizer n was residual in the soil at harvest when applying suitable nitrogen that matched plant demand macdonald et al 1989 jenkinson 2001 hence limiting soil nitrate nitrogen content before precipitation occurs should be one of the most effective methods to mitigate nitrate leaching losses some researchers suggest that split n application could avoid a large amount of nitrogen inputs in a single fertilization cameron et al 2013 zhou et al 2018a supplying a small portion of total nitrogen at planting coupled with multi split top dressing of the rest nitrogen according to crop nitrogen requirements can increase nitrogen use efficiency and yield of rice barley wheat potato and maize etc kuisma 2002 cai et al 2011 rahman et al 2011 chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018a 2018b compared with the conventional fertilization strategy wang et al 2016 suggested that split n fertilization significantly increased the plant uptake of nitrogen from fertilizers and the 15n recovery efficiency was 39 1 and 37 5 for 3 splits and 2 splits nitrogen applications which were significantly higher than that when applying all nitrogen before sowing 27 9 it is also reported that split n fertilization increased nitrogen use efficiency to 55 69 in rice when nitrogen was applied in vigorous stages zhu and chen 2002 the nitrogen rate can be reduced by 7 24 without yield loss of rice or wheat when the nitrogen was applied with two equal amounts at the seeding and panicle stage zhu 1997 in summary split n fertilization could reduce the losses of nitrogen and improve nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield but little research about multi split nitrogen fertilization strategy was conducted in summer maize seasons compared to traditional nitrogen application strategy it remains unclear how much nitrate leaching losses can be reduced in the case of split n fertigation strategies in semi humid region therefore the objective of this study was to 1 determine how much nitrate nitrogen losses can be reduced by multi split n fertilization compared with conventional nitrogen management strategy 2 compare the summer maize yield and nitrogen use efficiency of multi split n fertilization and conventional nitrogen management strategy 3 identify the optimal nitrogen fertilizer management strategy through economic benefit analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site our field

nitrate leaching measurement it is reported that maize roots are mostly found in the top 100 cm of soil layer zhou et al 2008 gao et al 2010 a rectangular shaped pvc leaching pan 50 60 cm with sides 5 cm height was installed at the depth of 100 cm in september 2015 and the nitrate leachate of top 100 cm soil layer was collected during the research trials in 2018 and 2019 growth seasons of summer maize the installation process is shown in fig 2a the collection system of nitrate leachate is presented in the sketch map fig 2b only about 6 cm soil was removed for installing rectangular shaped leaching pan the soil was backfilled and compacted after installed the pan before sowing of summer maize the solution collection tube was inspected and emptied to ensure that the collected samples occurred during the summer maize seasons in order to estimate the nitrate leaching loss the leachate was collected every 15 days after emergence the total volume of leachate was measured and ca 100 ml samples were taken and frozen at 20 for nitrate nitrogen analysis total nitrate leaching loss tnll during summer maize season was calculated using the following equation carneiro et al 2012 1 t n l l

n under different nitrogen management strategies during two growing seasons 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 3 the soil no3 n concentration under all treatments varied between 0 5 and 24 3 mg kg 1 in 0 200 cm soil layer at the ve stage the soil no3 n concentration in surface soil layer 0 30 cm was in the order of decreasing n rate fp mfp drip210 drip150 ck fig 3a and e as the plant grew the soil no3 n concentration of fp and mfp treatments gradually decreased and moved downwards but the soil no3 n concentration of drip210 and drip150 in the surface soil layer was always maintained at a higher level fig 3 at maturity fp and mfp have greater soil no3 n concentration in the deep soil layer below 100 cm fig 3d and i than drip210 and drip150 the depth of no3 n peak of fp was deeper than mfp in 2018 and 2019 the variation of soil no3 n content in the 0 60 cm soil layer during the maize growing season are shown in fig 4 the soil no3 n content in the 0 60 cm soil layer varied between 19 1 and 128 0 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 16 2 132 0 kg ha 1 in 2019 the fp treatment showed greater soil no3 n content than other treatments at the ve stage but gradually decreased with the growth of summer maize however the soil no3 n content of drip210 and drip150 maintained at a higher level throughout the growing season at maturity r6 stage the soil no3 n residual of 0 60 cm of fp mfp and drip210 was 52 1 55 0 and 95 3 kg ha 1 respectively drip210 and drip150 have higher no3 n residual in top 60 cm than that of fp mfp and ck 3 2 soil leachate and nitrate leaching losses the amount and nitrate concentration of soil leachate in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the growing season of summer maize are shown in fig 5 in 2018 only 2 leaching events ignoring negligible leaching events 2 mm occurred due to the continuous precipitation 1 july to 15 july and heavy precipitation 22 august figs 5a and 1 in 2019 5 leaching events were detected in the summer maize growing season the maximum leaching event appeared in september 2019 owing to continuous precipitation figs 5b and 1 the year y and nitrogen management strategy n had highly significant effects on total leachate amount p 0 01 however the interaction effect y n had no significant effects on total leachate amount p 0 05 table 2 the average leachate amount was 61 mm and 92 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared to 2018 52 soil leachate in 2019 was increased due to frequent precipitation fig 6a with respect to no3 n concentration of leachate there were significant differences under different nitrogen management strategies fig 5c and d leachate no3 n concentration in 2018 ranged from 5 2 to 70 9 mg l 1 among treatments averaging 26 2 mg l 1 in 2019 the range was from 6 0 to 68 8 and the average was 29 8 mg l 1 at the early growth stage of summer maize before 15 july the average leachate no3 n concentration of fp was 37 8 and 47 0 mg l 1 in 2018 and 2019 significantly higher than that of mfp and both fp and mfp were significantly higher than that of drip210 drip150 and ck at the middle and late growth stages sampled in 30 july and 15 august 30 august and 25 sepetember the leachate no3 n concentration of mfp was higher than that of fp due to the top dressing of large nitrogen fertilizer at the v12 stage under mfp during the whole growth period of summer maize the average no3 n concentration of leachate for drip210 and drip150 was 25 3 mg l 1 and 21 0 mg l 1 in 2018 22 8 mg l 1 and 17 3 mg l 1 in 2019 drip210 and drip150 significantly decreased the leachate no3 n concentration compared with fp and mfp compared to drip210 the two year average leachate no3 n concentration of drip150 was decreased by 20 4 there were highly significant effects of the year y nitrogen management strategy n and y n on total nitrate leaching losses tnll p 0 01 table 2 the average nitrate leaching losses were 15 5 kg ha 1 and 21 9 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 41 7 nitrate leaching losses increased in 2019 than that in 2018 fig 6b compared to ck nitrogen application significantly increased the amount of nitrate leaching losses the distinct difference was also detected between fp and mfp in 2018 and 2019 namely tnll of fp in 2018 was greater than that of mfp but tnll of mfp was greater than that of fp in 2019 this difference can be explained by precipitation distribution during the maize growing seasons in 2018 more precipitation occurred in the maize seedling stage and less precipitation fell from mid july to early august in 2019 less precipitation fell after planting through mid july but more precipitation fell in late july and early august fig 1 the two year average nitrate leaching losses 2018 and 2019 of fp were 28 1 kg ha 1 fig 6b compared to fp the nitrate leaching losses of mfp drip210 and drip150 were decreased by 7 3 32 4 and 48 7 respectively 3 3 above ground biomass and grain yield the dynamics of above ground biomass accumulation of summer maize in 2018 and 2019 growing seasons are shown in fig 7a and c the above ground biomass increased with days after emergence dae the significant difference of above ground biomass between ck and other treatments was detected from second sampling date after jointing above ground biomass of drip210 and drip150 was significantly higher than that of ck fp and mfp after 60 dae p 0 05 the biomass of drip210 and drip150 did not differ p 0 05 at maturity the highest above ground biomass was 17 5 and 19 3 t ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 both obtained by drip150 but there are no significant difference between drip150 and drip210 p 0 05 the above ground biomass of drip150 and drip210 was significantly higher than that of ck fp and mfp treatments the two year average above ground biomass increased by 79 0 95 1 107 3 and 108 9 under fp mfp drip210 and drip150 respectively compared with ck there were highly significant effects of the year y and nitrogen management strategy n on summer maize grain yield p 0 01 table 2 however the interaction effect y n have no significant effects on grain yield p 0 05 table 2 over the two years the grain yield of summer maize have similar trends for different nitrogen fertilizer management strategies in 2018 and 2019 ranged from 4 1 to 10 2 t ha 1 fig 7b and d grain yield under nitrogen fertilization strategies fp mfp drip210 and drip150 was significantly higher than that of ck increased by 69 6 129 3 in this two season field experiments drip210 and drip150 produced higher grain yield than fp and mfp p 0 05 in 2018 and 2019 the average grain yield of 2018 and 2019 was 9 7 and 9 8 t ha 1 for drip210 and drip150 the yield gap between drip210 and drip150 was not significant in 2018 and 2019 p 0 05 but drip150 saved 28 6 nitrogen fertilizer compared to drip210 compared with mfp the average grain yield of drip210 and drip150 increased by 16 6 and 17 5 fig 7b and d respectively those results demonstrated that drip fertigation with msf strategies could improve the grain yield of summer maize 3 4 nitrogen use efficiency there were significant and highly significant effects of the year y and nitrogen management strategy n on nue however the interactive effect of y and n has insignificant effects on nue table 2 the average nue of 2018 23 1 kg kg 1 was lower than 2019 25 6 kg kg 1 the two year average nue under drip150 was the highest and increased by 41 9 90 3 and 143 4 respectively compared with drip210 mfp and fp fig 8 3 5 economic benefit the total cost ranged from 4708 to 7823 cny ha 1 differed due to the differences of nitrogen management strategy table 3 the total cost of drip210 is higher than that of mfp and drip150 due to additional high cost piping material and more nitrogen fertilizer respectively over two growth seasons the gross profits ranged from 8641 to 19 817 cny ha 1 in 2018 and 9384 to 21 438 cny ha 1 in 2019 gross profit value was the following order drip150 drip210 mfp fp ck in 2018 and 2019 the average economic benefit under drip150 was the highest and increased by 397 and 1675 cny ha 1 respectively compared with drip210 and mfp table 3 4 discussion nitrate leaching losses in cultivated lands have caused much concern due to low nitrogen use efficiency and environmental contamination ju et al 2006 power and schepers 1989 dai et al 2016 in this study the two year average total nitrogen leaching losses tnll of fp is 28 12 kg ha 1 fig 6b higher than previous research results that the leaching losses ranged from 2 5 to 15 8 kg n ha 1 yr 1 when 165 495 kg n ha 1 was applied yang et al 2017 this difference could be explained by the fact that 434 and 522 mm precipitation was occurred in maize growth season in 2018 and 2019 higher than the annual mean precipitation about 400 mm of summer maize season ding et al 2018 fan et al 2010 namely 2018 and 2019 were abundant precipitation year the concentration and volume of the leachate jointly affect the nitrate leaching losses abundant precipitation will lead to a large amount of nitrate leachate which directly affects tnll cameron et al 2013 compared to 2018 52 soil leachate in 2019 was increased due to frequent precipitation this may be the reason why 41 7 nitrate leaching losses increased in 2019 than that in 2018 fig 6b in this study the average leachate nitrate concentration of fp was 37 8 and 47 0 mg l 1 in 2018 and 2019 being consistent with the concentration of 36 0 mg l 1 reported by yang et al 2015 however the average concentration of drip210 and drip150 was 25 3 and 21 0 mg l 1 in 2018 22 8 and 17 3 mg l 1 in 2019 significantly lower than that of fp and mfp this might be related with soil nitrate profile distribution coming from different nitrogen management strategies nitrogen application pattern time and amount are all important factors affecting soil no3 n distribution and residual zhou et al 2018a wu et al 2019 hondebrink et al 2017 the siol no3 n content increased with increasing of fertilization rate yan et al 2020 higher soil no3 n content is beneficial to nitrate leaching into deeper soil lee and jose 2005 conventional fertilization strategy spread all nitrogen at sowing resulting in higher no3 n content in the soil at early growth stage the continuous precipitation occurred in early july in 2018 and mid to late june in 2019 might contribute to this downward movement yin et al 2007 drip fertigation can apply nitrogen at any time during the growth season according to plant requirements fanish et al 2011 which could avoid a lot of nitrogen applied at one times before planting and adjust fertigation to after precipitation occurs those may be the reason that the two year average tnll of drip210 and drip150 were decreased by 32 4 and 48 7 respectively compared with fp it is reported that the soil no3 n residual after summer maize harvest could meet the nitrogen requirement for early growing stages of wheat in winter wheat and summer maize rotation system and the residual no3 n provides a foundation for a higher yield of winter wheat pen et al 1981 ferguson et al 2002 however it must be recognized that the soil no3 n must remain in root zone in our study drip150 and drip210 have more residual soil no3 n at maturity in 0 60 cm soil layer than that of fp and mfp fig 4 at the same time the precipitation from october to march is very scarce which means that soil no3 n is not leached beyond the root zone by precipitation multi split n fertigation could increase maize grain yield the grain yield of drip210 increased by 18 5 and 14 9 than mfp in 2018 and 2019 under same nitrogen rate 210 kg ha 1 this result is consistent with zhou et al 2017 who reported that drip fertigation increased maize grain yield by 13 15 than conventional fertilization the reason may be that on the one hand drip fertigation could supply nitrogen in mid and late growth periods fanish et al 2011 which maintained a higher nitrate content in 0 60 cm layer throughout maize growth period fig 4 the maize roots mainly concentrated in this soil layer zhou et al 2008 gao et al 2010 zou et al 2017 it is consistent with the results that the continuous improvements in above ground biomass and n accumulation during the post silking stage are essential for obtaining high yield of maize liu et al 2014 and the yield is still responsive to nitrogen application until r1 stage scharf et al 2002 on the other hand when all nitrogen was applied at sowing intensive and heavy precipitation could lead to soil nitrate leaching into deeper soil which caused insufficient nitrogen in the root zone to satisfy crop demand in the late growth period nitrogen deficiency could cause early leaf senescence resulting in low light interception and yield zhou et al 2016a 2016b 2018a nitrogen fertilizer management strategies not only affect soil nitrate leaching losses fig 6b but also affect ammonia volatilization losses zhang et al 2020 compared with conventional farmers practice surface broadcast drip fertigation can reduce ammonia volatilization losses haynes 1985 zhou et al 2016b bar tal et al 2015 this may be one of the reasons why the nitrogen use efficiency of drip210 and drip150 is higher than that of fp and mfp in this study drip150 and drip210 have insignificant difference in grain yield fig 7b and d but the nitrogen input of drip150 is lower than drip 210 which leading to higher nitrogen use efficiency and economic benefit of drip150 suggesting that 150 kg ha 1 nitrogen could meet maize demand for nitrogen under drip multi split n fertigation strategies this amount was lower than the result reported by yang et al 2017 who recommended 180 200 kg ha 1 nitrogen for maize in guanzhong plain moreover the average grain yield of 9 8 t ha 1 was harvested in drip150 higher than the yield 8 3 t ha 1 reported by yang et al 2017 therefore drip fertigation with 150 kg ha 1 nitrogen could be applied in this kind area for higher grain yield nitrogen use efficiency and economic benefit 5 conclusion conventional farmer s practice applying all nitrogen at sowing leads to large nitrate nitrogen maintained in the soil at early growth stage which increased the risk of nitrate leaching losses when intensive precipitation occurred after fertilization drip210 and drip150 maintained soil no3 n content in 0 60 cm soil layer at a steady level throughout the maize growing season reduced total nitrate leaching losses than conventional nitrogen managing strategy both drip210 and drip150 obtained higher grain yield and economic benefit than conventional farmer s practice and modified conventional farmer s practice p 0 05 compared to drip210 drip150 saved 28 6 nitrogen fertilizer increased 397 cny ha 1 and reduced 24 0 total nitrate leaching losses therefore optimized split n fertigation strategy drip150 is recommended as one of the alternative strategies to synchronously increase the grain yield nitrogen use efficiency and reduce nitrate leaching losses

10204,reducing soil nitrate leaching losses from agricultural ecosystem and improving crop yield and nitrogen use efficiency with effective nitrogen management strategies are extremely important for

than fp and mfp the total nitrate leaching losses tnll of drip210 and drip150 were significantly lower than that of fp and mfp p 0 05 the two year average tnll of drip210 and drip150 was 19 0 and 14 4 kg ha 1 decreased by 32 4 and 48 7 compared with fp 28 1 kg ha 1 respectively the above ground biomass grain yield and nue of drip210 and drip150 were higher than that of fp and mfp p 0 05 both drip210 and drip150 achieved comparable grain yield but drip150 used 28 6 less nitrogen than drip210 resulted in 24 0 lower tnll and higher nue than drip210 in addition the average economic benefit under drip150 was the highest and increased by 397 and 1675 cny ha 1 respectively compared with drip210 and mfp therefore drip150 was recommended as a promising fertilization strategy to reduce nitrate leaching losses and improve nitrogen use efficiency while maintain high crop yield and economic benefit in northwest china keywords drip fertigation soil leachate nitrogen use efficiency sustainable agricultural 1 introduction nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients for plant growth however agricultural activities cultivation and harvest decrease total nitrogen contents of topsoil in the semiarid regions around the world dalal and mayer 1986 urioste et al 2006 to overcome the problem of nutrient deficiency and achieve high crop yield growers often apply a large amount of fertilizers in the farmland these behaviors have led to excessive nitrogen with improper time applied in agricultural production systems without considering their environmental consequences which has created a high risk of nitrate leaching below the root zone when intensive precipitation occurs during crop growth periods wei et al 2009 zhou et al 2018a in addition excessive nitrogen application also have resulted in low nitrogen use efficiency gao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 and increased crop production costs hence a scientific nitrogen management strategy for improving nitrogen use efficiency and reducing nitrate leaching losses while maintaining high grain yield is imperative for the sustainable agricultural development the rotation of winter wheat and summer maize is a common cropping system in the semi humid and drought prone climate zone which plays a significant role in food supply in northwest china local farmers apply ca 500 600 kg n ha 1 yr 1 for achieving high grain yield of maize and wheat in the crop rotation system ju et al 2009 and about 60 of this total nitrogen is applied in the summer maize growing season jia et al 2014 in the region with this rotation system the annual precipitation is about 620 mm ding et al 2018 about 70 distributed from june to september summer maize growth periods fan et al 2010 therefore high nitrogen application with intensive precipitation aggravates the nitrate nitrogen leaching into a deep soil during the summer maize seasons which can increase the pollution risk of water resources and decrease nitrogen use efficiency yang et al 2015 reported that almost all nitrate leaching losses events caused by precipitation occurred during maize growth periods in the winter wheat and summer maize rotation system therefore the nitrogen use and nitrate leaching losses should be studied with great efforts during the summer maize growth period urea a nitrogen fertilizer commonly used in this area is hydrolyzed into ammonium after being applied to the soil which then quickly converted to nitrate azad et al 2019 nitrate is very soluble and can run off into the surface water or flow into the groundwater howden et al 2013 in this area the conventional nitrogen application strategy is to apply all nitrogen urea at sowing mid june intensive precipitation usually causes a large amount of nitrate leaching into the deep soil which always leads to insufficient nitrogen in the soil to meet the crop demand in the late seasons zhou et al 2018a fernandez et al 2020 therefore conventional fertilization strategy is always associated with low nitrogen use efficiency water use efficiency and yield as well as high nitrate leaching risk nitrate leaching losses mainly depends on the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in the soil solution and the amount of soil leachate cameron et al 2013 the residual amount of nitrate in the soil depends on the rate of nitrogen application and plant uptake di and cameron 2000 reported that there were quadratic relationships between the potentially leachable nitrogen mineral n and readily mineralisable n and annual leaching losses in the soil only negligible amount of fertilizer n was residual in the soil at harvest when applying suitable nitrogen that matched plant demand macdonald et al 1989 jenkinson 2001 hence limiting soil nitrate nitrogen content before precipitation occurs should be one of the most effective methods to mitigate nitrate leaching losses some researchers suggest that split n application could avoid a large amount of nitrogen inputs in a single fertilization cameron et al 2013 zhou et al 2018a supplying a small portion of total nitrogen at planting coupled with multi split top dressing of the rest nitrogen according to crop nitrogen requirements can increase nitrogen use efficiency and yield of rice barley wheat potato and maize etc kuisma 2002 cai et al 2011 rahman et al 2011 chen et al 2015 zhou et al 2018a 2018b compared with the conventional fertilization strategy wang et al 2016 suggested that split n fertilization significantly increased the plant uptake of nitrogen from fertilizers and the 15n recovery efficiency was 39 1 and 37 5 for 3 splits and 2 splits nitrogen applications which were significantly higher than that when applying all nitrogen before sowing 27 9 it is also reported that split n fertilization increased nitrogen use efficiency to 55 69 in rice when nitrogen was applied in vigorous stages zhu and chen 2002 the nitrogen rate can be reduced by 7 24 without yield loss of rice or wheat when the nitrogen was applied with two equal amounts at the seeding and panicle stage zhu 1997 in summary split n fertilization could reduce the losses of nitrogen and improve nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield but little research about multi split nitrogen fertilization strategy was conducted in summer maize seasons compared to traditional nitrogen application strategy it remains unclear how much nitrate leaching losses can be reduced in the case of split n fertigation strategies in semi humid region therefore the objective of this study was to 1 determine how much nitrate nitrogen losses can be reduced by multi split n fertilization compared with conventional nitrogen management strategy 2 compare the summer maize yield and nitrogen use efficiency of multi split n fertilization and conventional nitrogen management strategy 3 identify the optimal nitrogen fertilizer management strategy through economic benefit analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site our field

17 august 30 august and 25 september 2019 soil samples were well mixed and air dried for testing soil nitrate nitrogen soil nitrate nitrogen was extracted from 5 g soil samples using 50 ml 2 mol l 1 kcl after shaken for 0 5 h at a constant 25 after filtration the samples were analyzed through the micro flow autoanalyzer3 aa3 seal company germany to determine soil nitrate nitrogen content 2 3 3 nitrate leaching measurement it is reported that maize roots are mostly found in the top 100 cm of soil layer zhou et al 2008 gao et al 2010 a rectangular shaped pvc leaching pan 50 60 cm with sides 5 cm height was installed at the depth of 100 cm in september 2015 and the nitrate leachate of top 100 cm soil layer was collected during the research trials in 2018 and 2019 growth seasons of summer maize the installation process is shown in fig 2a the collection system of nitrate leachate is presented in the sketch map fig 2b only about 6 cm soil was removed for installing rectangular shaped leaching pan the soil was backfilled and compacted after installed the pan before sowing of summer maize the solution collection tube was inspected and emptied to ensure that the collected samples occurred during the summer maize seasons in order to estimate the nitrate leaching loss the leachate was collected every 15 days after emergence the total volume of leachate was measured and ca 100 ml samples were taken and frozen at 20 for nitrate nitrogen analysis total nitrate leaching loss tnll during summer maize season was calculated using the following equation carneiro et al 2012 1 t n l l

n under different nitrogen management strategies during two growing seasons 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 3 the soil no3 n concentration under all treatments varied between 0 5 and 24 3 mg kg 1 in 0 200 cm soil layer at the ve stage the soil no3 n concentration in surface soil layer 0 30 cm was in the order of decreasing n rate fp mfp drip210 drip150 ck fig 3a and e as the plant grew the soil no3 n concentration of fp and mfp treatments gradually decreased and moved downwards but the soil no3 n concentration of drip210 and drip150 in the surface soil layer was always maintained at a higher level fig 3 at maturity fp and mfp have greater soil no3 n concentration in the deep soil layer below 100 cm fig 3d and i than drip210 and drip150 the depth of no3 n peak of fp was deeper than mfp in 2018 and 2019 the variation of soil no3 n content in the 0 60 cm soil layer during the maize growing season are shown in fig 4 the soil no3 n content in the 0 60 cm soil layer varied between 19 1 and 128 0 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 16 2 132 0 kg ha 1 in 2019 the fp treatment showed greater soil no3 n content than other treatments at the ve stage but gradually decreased with the growth of summer maize however the soil no3 n content of drip210 and drip150 maintained at a higher level throughout the growing season at maturity r6 stage the soil no3 n residual of 0 60 cm of fp mfp and drip210 was 52 1 55 0 and 95 3 kg ha 1 respectively drip210 and drip150 have higher no3 n residual in top 60 cm than that of fp mfp and ck 3 2 soil leachate and nitrate leaching losses the amount and nitrate concentration of soil leachate in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the growing season of summer maize are shown in fig 5 in 2018 only 2 leaching events ignoring negligible leaching events 2 mm occurred due to the continuous precipitation 1 july to 15 july and heavy precipitation 22 august figs 5a and 1 in 2019 5 leaching events were detected in the summer maize growing season the maximum leaching event appeared in september 2019 owing to continuous precipitation figs 5b and 1 the year y and nitrogen management strategy n had highly significant effects on total leachate amount p 0 01 however the interaction effect y n had no significant effects on total leachate amount p 0 05 table 2 the average leachate amount was 61 mm and 92 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively compared to 2018 52 soil leachate in 2019 was increased due to frequent precipitation fig 6a with respect to no3 n concentration of leachate there were significant differences under different nitrogen management strategies fig 5c and d leachate no3 n concentration in 2018 ranged from 5 2 to 70 9 mg l 1 among treatments averaging 26 2 mg l 1 in 2019 the range was from 6 0 to 68 8 and the average was 29 8 mg l 1 at the early growth stage of summer maize before 15 july the average leachate no3 n concentration of fp was 37 8 and 47 0 mg l 1 in 2018 and 2019 significantly higher than that of mfp and both fp and mfp were significantly higher than that of drip210 drip150 and ck at the middle and late growth stages sampled in 30 july and 15 august 30 august and 25 sepetember the leachate no3 n concentration of mfp was higher than that of fp due to the top dressing of large nitrogen fertilizer at the v12 stage under mfp during the whole growth period of summer maize the average no3 n concentration of leachate for drip210 and drip150 was 25 3 mg l 1 and 21 0 mg l 1 in 2018 22 8 mg l 1 and 17 3 mg l 1 in 2019 drip210 and drip150 significantly decreased the leachate no3 n concentration compared with fp and mfp compared to drip210 the two year average leachate no3 n concentration of drip150 was decreased by 20 4 there were highly significant effects of the year y nitrogen management strategy n and y n on total nitrate leaching losses tnll p 0 01 table 2 the average nitrate leaching losses were 15 5 kg ha 1 and 21 9 kg ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 41 7 nitrate leaching losses increased in 2019 than that in 2018 fig 6b compared to ck nitrogen application significantly increased the amount of nitrate leaching losses the distinct difference was also detected between fp and mfp in 2018 and 2019 namely tnll of fp in 2018 was greater than that of mfp but tnll of mfp was greater than that of fp in 2019 this difference can be explained by precipitation distribution during the maize growing seasons in 2018 more precipitation occurred in the maize seedling stage and less precipitation fell from mid july to early august in 2019 less precipitation fell after planting through mid july but more precipitation fell in late july and early august fig 1 the two year average nitrate leaching losses 2018 and 2019 of fp were 28 1 kg ha 1 fig 6b compared to fp the nitrate leaching losses of mfp drip210 and drip150 were decreased by 7 3 32 4 and 48 7 respectively 3 3 above ground biomass and grain yield the dynamics of above ground biomass accumulation of summer maize in 2018 and 2019 growing seasons are shown in fig 7a and c the above ground biomass increased with days after emergence dae the significant difference of above ground biomass between ck and other treatments was detected from second sampling date after jointing above ground biomass of drip210 and drip150 was significantly higher than that of ck fp and mfp after 60 dae p 0 05 the biomass of drip210 and drip150 did not differ p 0 05 at maturity the highest above ground biomass was 17 5 and 19 3 t ha 1 in 2018 and 2019 both obtained by drip150 but there are no significant difference between drip150 and drip210 p 0 05 the above ground biomass of drip150 and drip210 was significantly higher than that of ck fp and mfp treatments the two year average above ground biomass increased by 79 0 95 1 107 3 and 108 9 under fp mfp drip210 and drip150 respectively compared with ck there were highly significant effects of the year y and nitrogen management strategy n on summer maize grain yield p 0 01 table 2 however the interaction effect y n have no significant effects on grain yield p 0 05 table 2 over the two years the grain yield of summer maize have similar trends for different nitrogen fertilizer management strategies in 2018 and 2019 ranged from 4 1 to 10 2 t ha 1 fig 7b and d grain yield under nitrogen fertilization strategies fp mfp drip210 and drip150 was significantly higher than that of ck increased by 69 6 129 3 in this two season field experiments drip210 and drip150 produced higher grain yield than fp and mfp p 0 05 in 2018 and 2019 the average grain yield of 2018 and 2019 was 9 7 and 9 8 t ha 1 for drip210 and drip150 the yield gap between drip210 and drip150 was not significant in 2018 and 2019 p 0 05 but drip150 saved 28 6 nitrogen fertilizer compared to drip210 compared with mfp the average grain yield of drip210 and drip150 increased by 16 6 and 17 5 fig 7b and d respectively those results demonstrated that drip fertigation with msf strategies could improve the grain yield of summer maize 3 4 nitrogen use efficiency there were significant and highly significant effects of the year y and nitrogen management strategy n on nue however the interactive effect of y and n has insignificant effects on nue table 2 the average nue of 2018 23 1 kg kg 1 was lower than 2019 25 6 kg kg 1 the two year average nue under drip150 was the highest and increased by 41 9 90 3 and 143 4 respectively compared with drip210 mfp and fp fig 8 3 5 economic benefit the total cost ranged from 4708 to 7823 cny ha 1 differed due to the differences of nitrogen management strategy table 3 the total cost of drip210 is higher than that of mfp and drip150 due to additional high cost piping material and more nitrogen fertilizer respectively over two growth seasons the gross profits ranged from 8641 to 19 817 cny ha 1 in 2018 and 9384 to 21 438 cny ha 1 in 2019 gross profit value was the following order drip150 drip210 mfp fp ck in 2018 and 2019 the average economic benefit under drip150 was the highest and increased by 397 and 1675 cny ha 1 respectively compared with drip210 and mfp table 3 4 discussion nitrate leaching losses in cultivated lands have caused much concern due to low nitrogen use efficiency and environmental contamination ju et al 2006 power and schepers 1989 dai et al 2016 in this study the two year average total nitrogen leaching losses tnll of fp is 28 12 kg ha 1 fig 6b higher than previous research results that the leaching losses ranged from 2 5 to 15 8 kg n ha 1 yr 1 when 165 495 kg n ha 1 was applied yang et al 2017 this difference could be explained by the fact that 434 and 522 mm precipitation was occurred in maize growth season in 2018 and 2019 higher than the annual mean precipitation about 400 mm of summer maize season ding et al 2018 fan et al 2010 namely 2018 and 2019 were abundant precipitation year the concentration and volume of the leachate jointly affect the nitrate leaching losses abundant precipitation will lead to a large amount of nitrate leachate which directly affects tnll cameron et al 2013 compared to 2018 52 soil leachate in 2019 was increased due to frequent precipitation this may be the reason why 41 7 nitrate leaching losses increased in 2019 than that in 2018 fig 6b in this study the average leachate nitrate concentration of fp was 37 8 and 47 0 mg l 1 in 2018 and 2019 being consistent with the concentration of 36 0 mg l 1 reported by yang et al 2015 however the average concentration of drip210 and drip150 was 25 3 and 21 0 mg l 1 in 2018 22 8 and 17 3 mg l 1 in 2019 significantly lower than that of fp and mfp this might be related with soil nitrate profile distribution coming from different nitrogen management strategies nitrogen application pattern time and amount are all important factors affecting soil no3 n distribution and residual zhou et al 2018a wu et al 2019 hondebrink et al 2017 the siol no3 n content increased with increasing of fertilization rate yan et al 2020 higher soil no3 n content is beneficial to nitrate leaching into deeper soil lee and jose 2005 conventional fertilization strategy spread all nitrogen at sowing resulting in higher no3 n content in the soil at early growth stage the continuous precipitation occurred in early july in 2018 and mid to late june in 2019 might contribute to this downward movement yin et al 2007 drip fertigation can apply nitrogen at any time during the growth season according to plant requirements fanish et al 2011 which could avoid a lot of nitrogen applied at one times before planting and adjust fertigation to after precipitation occurs those may be the reason that the two year average tnll of drip210 and drip150 were decreased by 32 4 and 48 7 respectively compared with fp it is reported that the soil no3 n residual after summer maize harvest could meet the nitrogen requirement for early growing stages of wheat in winter wheat and summer maize rotation system and the residual no3 n provides a foundation for a higher yield of winter wheat pen et al 1981 ferguson et al 2002 however it must be recognized that the soil no3 n must remain in root zone in our study drip150 and drip210 have more residual soil no3 n at maturity in 0 60 cm soil layer than that of fp and mfp fig 4 at the same time the precipitation from october to march is very scarce which means that soil no3 n is not leached beyond the root zone by precipitation multi split n fertigation could increase maize grain yield the grain yield of drip210 increased by 18 5 and 14 9 than mfp in 2018 and 2019 under same nitrogen rate 210 kg ha 1 this result is consistent with zhou et al 2017 who reported that drip fertigation increased maize grain yield by 13 15 than conventional fertilization the reason may be that on the one hand drip fertigation could supply nitrogen in mid and late growth periods fanish et al 2011 which maintained a higher nitrate content in 0 60 cm layer throughout maize growth period fig 4 the maize roots mainly concentrated in this soil layer zhou et al 2008 gao et al 2010 zou et al 2017 it is consistent with the results that the continuous improvements in above ground biomass and n accumulation during the post silking stage are essential for obtaining high yield of maize liu et al 2014 and the yield is still responsive to nitrogen application until r1 stage scharf et al 2002 on the other hand when all nitrogen was applied at sowing intensive and heavy precipitation could lead to soil nitrate leaching into deeper soil which caused insufficient nitrogen in the root zone to satisfy crop demand in the late growth period nitrogen deficiency could cause early leaf senescence resulting in low light interception and yield zhou et al 2016a 2016b 2018a nitrogen fertilizer management strategies not only affect soil nitrate leaching losses fig 6b but also affect ammonia volatilization losses zhang et al 2020 compared with conventional farmers practice surface broadcast drip fertigation can reduce ammonia volatilization losses haynes 1985 zhou et al 2016b bar tal et al 2015 this may be one of the reasons why the nitrogen use efficiency of drip210 and drip150 is higher than that of fp and mfp in this study drip150 and drip210 have insignificant difference in grain yield fig 7b and d but the nitrogen input of drip150 is lower than drip 210 which leading to higher nitrogen use efficiency and economic benefit of drip150 suggesting that 150 kg ha 1 nitrogen could meet maize demand for nitrogen under drip multi split n fertigation strategies this amount was lower than the result reported by yang et al 2017 who recommended 180 200 kg ha 1 nitrogen for maize in guanzhong plain moreover the average grain yield of 9 8 t ha 1 was harvested in drip150 higher than the yield 8 3 t ha 1 reported by yang et al 2017 therefore drip fertigation with 150 kg ha 1 nitrogen could be applied in this kind area for higher grain yield nitrogen use efficiency and economic benefit 5 conclusion conventional farmer s practice applying all nitrogen at sowing leads to large nitrate nitrogen maintained in the soil at early growth stage which increased the risk of nitrate leaching losses when intensive precipitation occurred after fertilization drip210 and drip150 maintained soil no3 n content in 0 60 cm soil layer at a steady level throughout the maize growing season reduced total nitrate leaching losses than conventional nitrogen managing strategy both drip210 and drip150 obtained higher grain yield and economic benefit than conventional farmer s practice and modified conventional farmer s practice p 0 05 compared to drip210 drip150 saved 28 6 nitrogen fertilizer increased 397 cny ha 1 and reduced 24 0 total nitrate leaching losses therefore optimized split n fertigation strategy drip150 is recommended as one of the alternative strategies to synchronously increase the grain yield nitrogen use efficiency and reduce nitrate leaching losses
