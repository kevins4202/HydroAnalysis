3925,the coastal aquifers experience periodic freshening and salinization events due to frequent changes in hydrological conditions such frequent changes have vital effects on the coastal groundwater quality and aquifer properties this forms the basis of the present study laboratory based column experiments have been conducted to investigate the long term impact of such periodic events on coastal groundwater quality and aquifer sediment characteristics conditions similar to the natural coastal aquifer systems were generated in sediment filled columns by injecting freshwater and seawater periodically changes in pore water chemistry and sediment properties were monitored over a period of one year it has been observed that periodic injections of freshwater freshening and seawater salinization caused significant changes in the pore water chemistry mainly due to sediment water interactions in addition to seawater freshwater mixing geochemical processes such as ion exchange mineral precipitation dissolution and adsorption desorption of elements have been identified to control the pore water chemistry trace elements including barium boron bromide lithium and strontium have been identified as effective tracers for monitoring the saltwater intrusion further the changes in pore water chemistry are found to be interlinked with the changes in aquifer properties it is observed that with the increase in the number of salinization cycles the effectiveness of the freshening process to bring back the original aquifer pore water chemistry diminishes and the impact of salinization lasts longer at the end of the experiment changes in the porosity and permeability of the sediments have been observed such changes in the aquifer properties may affect the specific yield and storativity of the aquifer keywords coastal aquifer hydrochemical processes saltwater intrusion sediment water interaction column experiment 1 introduction saltwater intrusion in the coastal aquifers leads to the loss of freshwater resources and is a major cause of concern globally the water demand in coastal cities is increasing exponentially mainly due to rapid population growth associated with large scale migration and improved living standards zume et al 2021 to meet this ever increasing water demand existing groundwater resources are exploited indiscriminately and bringing them under stress this aggravating problem has attracted significant scientific attention and investigations on various aspects of saltwater intrusion have been conducted the complex aquifer geometry high ionic strength of water along with the involvement of a multi component system make these studies highly challenging sajil kumar 2016 a number of studies involving field surveys laboratory experiments and hydrochemical modeling have been undertaken across the globe the field surveys have been especially successful in assessing saltwater intrusion on local scales kazakis et al 2016 mohanty and gurunadha rao 2019 najib et al 2017 however for larger areas this approach being time consuming did not provide an appreciable outcome in a few studies natural coastal systems have been established through laboratory experiments and saltwater intrusion under different hydrological conditions has been investigated the behavior of seawater freshwater mixing mastrocicco et al 2012 solute transport anderson et al 2005 groundwater flow oz et al 2014 nutrient exchange russak et al 2015 the efficiency of subsurface barriers to prevent saltwater intrusion li et al 2018 etc are some of the issues addressed through such laboratory based experiments the modeling studies have been applied to understand the role of sea level rise tidal influence groundwater overexploitation etc on saltwater intrusion rajaveni et al 2016 shen et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 despite extensive research due to the complexity of processes at local and regional scales no standard protocol exists that can be applied universally to have a comprehensive understanding of the saltwater intrusion problems thus each area needs to be investigated individually the saltwater intrusion occurs in coastal aquifers when the hydrodynamic balance between the freshwater and seawater maintained by the freshwater seawater interface zone gets disturbed naik 2018 the depth of the freshwater seawater interface depends upon the density contrast between the freshwater and seawater and the height of the water table above the mean sea level fig 1 ghyben 1889 herzberg 1901 studies have shown that frequent fluctuation in the water table occurs due to seasonal and diurnal changes in groundwater recharge and extraction prusty and farooq 2020a the behaviour of freshwater seawater interface to groundwater recharge and discharge conditions is shown in fig 1 changes in regional and global scale phenomena such as climate change sea level rise coastal flooding shoreline erosion storm surge etc also affect the water table in coastal regions grases et al 2020 in response to these water table fluctuations the freshwater seawater interface moves up or down frequently throughout the year this in turn exposes the coastal aquifer sediments periodically to freshwater and seawater conditions fig 1 the freshwater and seawater have significant differences in their chemistry i e ph ec and chemical composition thus the periodic exposure of coastal aquifer sediments to the prevailing water may affect the geochemical processes such as adsorption ion exchange breakdown dissolution of existing minerals and formation of new minerals due to differential saltwater freshwater interaction with the aquifer sediments amiri et al 2016a sajil kumar 2016 these processes not only affect the coastal groundwater chemistry but may also bring irreversible changes in vital aquifer properties such as porosity and permeability any change in aquifer parameters such as reduction or increase in permeability near the interface may significantly influence the movement of saltwater into the coastal aquifers since the damages caused to the aquifer and subsequently to agricultural land by seawater ingression are difficult to reverse it is very necessary to have a detailed understanding of the geochemical processes that occur in the aquifer and control the groundwater pore water chemistry and may affect the aquifer properties for the understanding of the sediment water interaction processes and their effects on the pore water quality a few laboratory based experimental studies involving sediment filled tanks and columns have been conducted these studies enhanced the scientific understanding of various aspects including the behavior of contaminants in coastal aquifers zhang et al 2002 mapping of contaminant transport due to saltwater movement chang and clement 2013 observing the groundwater flow patterns within the freshwater saltwater interface oz et al 2015 geochemical evolution of coastal water ronen eliraz et al 2017 and understanding of mass transfer processes at the sediment water interface drouin et al 2021 further column experiments have been conducted to study how the freshening and salinization processes in coastal aquifers modify the pore water chemistry boluda botella et al 2008 russak et al 2016 russak and sivan 2010 it is important to note that in these studies the column experiment sediment water interaction experiment was run for a shorter time period 1 2 months with a close sampling interval such experimental conditions have provided a very limited time for the water to interact with the sediments under these circumstances many of the slow processes that occur in the natural system may not get recorded or get over shadowed by quick and dominant processes such as seawater freshwater mixing thus for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of periodic freshening and saltwater intrusion on the pore water chemistry it is of vital importance that the sediment water interaction should be monitored over a longer time period further the repeated equilibrium and re equilibrium of the aquifer sediments with periodically changing water chemistry may affect the porosity and permeability which has never been investigated the change in the porosity and permeability may affect the specific storage and specific yield of the aquifer to fill these gaps in scientific understanding a column experiment based study has been conducted in this study sediment filled columns were made to interact with seawater and freshwater alternatively over a period of one year with the aims to i evaluate the impact of periodic freshening salinization on the pore water chemistry and aquifer sediments ii understand the role of geochemical processes in controlling the coastal aquifer properties and iii determine the changes in vital aquifer parameters i e porosity and permeability due to periodic freshening and salinization of aquifer sediments the outcome of the column experiment study has been verified through the field observations thus the present study provides a detailed understanding of the effects of periodic freshening salinization on the coastal aquifers such an understanding will help in devising a long term and sustainable solution for the efficient management of coastal water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation it is well known that the coastal aquifers are mainly composed of sand with a minor amount of silt and clay content ganesan et al 2014 in view of this sand silt and clay fractions were mixed in different weight proportions to prepare the sediments representative of a wide variety of the coastal aquifers further detail in table 1 these sediments were then used as infilling material in the columns sand samples were collected from the daya river that falls into the bay of bengal india while silt and clay fractions were extracted from the nearby subsurface sediments 3 m depth by sieving technique 63 µm bigger size particles from the sand were removed by sieving it with a 250 µm sieve fresh groundwater collected from an inland area odisha india and seawater from the bay of bengal were injected periodically into these sediment filled columns to simulate the natural coastal aquifer system in the laboratory through the column experiment the sediment and water samples were collected during the summer season april 2018 the sample collection sites are shown in fig 2 2 2 column experiment description the experimental setup involving nine standalone columns internal diameter 5 cm length 40 cm was fabricated for the laboratory column experiment three sets of columns were made with each set consisting of three columns a b and c column a of each set contained a mixture of 80 sand and 20 silt clay similarly column b of each set had 85 sand and 15 silt clay while column c of each set was filled with 90 sand and 10 silt clay for developing the homogenous media the sediments were slowly packed into thin layers 1 cm followed by soft compaction with a pestle oliviera et al 1996 silicon tubes were connected to small openings made at both ends of each column casings to facilitate the inflow and outflow of water through the column sediments porous plastic disks were placed at both ends of the column to facilitate the uniform distribution of inflowing water and prevent any loss of sediments with the outflowing water fig 3 a the water was injected into the columns with the help of peristaltic pumps the schematics of the column experiment and view of the actual column experiment in the laboratory are shown in fig 3a b in the first column set freshwater was injected named as column set f while in the second column set seawater was injected named as column set s throughout the experiment duration however in the third set of columns freshwater and seawater were injected alternatively named as column set m this way the experiment was run simultaneously for all three column sets the notations for all columns are presented in table 1 in all columns the flow of water was maintained from bottom to top with a flow rate of 1 ml min with the help of peristaltic pumps bottom to top flow with a low flow rate was opted to facilitate maximum sediment water interaction and minimal preferential flow of injected water through the column walls russak et al 2015 the injection of water was stopped 30 minutes after attaining the complete saturation and overflow in the columns consequently the silicon tubes at both ends were blocked i e sealed to entrap the water in the columns and facilitate the sediment water interaction after a specific time period the silicon tubes were unblocked from both ends which let the columns drain naturally the drained waters were collected as samples termed as pore water hereafter before the next injection the pore water collected from the columns represents the groundwater that exists in the coastal aquifers under natural conditions in column set m the seawater was injected after the natural draining of the freshwater and vice versa for the entire duration of the experiment however to eliminate the effect of the freshwater retained in these columns as adsorbed or held in interstitial spaces due to cohesion capillary action the columns were first saturated with seawater 1st injection and drained immediately subsequently they were saturated again with seawater 2nd injection for sediment water interaction pore water samples were collected at the time of draining the 2nd injection after a specified time period the same practice has been followed while injecting the freshwater to minimize the effect of retained seawater in the columns the alternate exposure of column m sediments to freshwater and seawater mimics the natural condition that the aquifer sediments experience due to periodic fluctuation of the seawater freshwater interface in the coastal regions the replacement of freshwater by seawater in these three columns am bm and cm represents the salinization event while the replacement of seawater by freshwater indicates the freshening event column sets f and s have been run as reference columns thus were injected only with freshwater and seawater respectively throughout the experiment period in response to various geological and climatological processes the salinization and freshening of coastal aquifers varies widely in space and time thus there cannot be a specific time interval for salinization and freshening that can be applied universally in the initial stage of the experiment the injection and sample collection were followed at two days intervals for the first 28 days of the experiment at the start of the experiment quicker sediment water interaction processes were expected to control the pore water chemistry thus salinization and freshening with shorter interval was planned to monitor these processes more closely however in the later stages the injection and sample collection interval was subsequently increased to four days for the next 24 days two weeks for the next 16 weeks and four weeks for the last 32 weeks for higher exposure of sediments to different water conditions for monitoring of slower processes with these intervals the experiment was conducted continuously for a period of 56 weeks with the devised execution plan the entire experiment period includes 18 freshening and 18 salinization events in column set m however due to the absence of alternate freshwater and saline water injections the column sets f and s had 36 freshwater and 36 seawater injections respectively a total of 324 pore water samples were collected from all three column sets during the entire experiment period this includes 108 samples from each set of columns i e 36 samples from each column each sampling involves collecting 25 30 ml of pore water from each column and filtering it with 0 45 µm polycarbonate membrane filters the filtered pore water samples were sub sampled into two parts non acidified and acidified with ultrapure hno3 for the analysis of anions and cations respectively these water samples were stored at low temperatures 4 c in polyethylene vials until their analysis the stock freshwater and seawater used in the experiment for injection purposes were also analyzed after the completion of the experiment the sediments were recovered from each column the recovered sediments from each column were sub sampled into three parts bottom middle and top and packed in zip locked bags these sub sampled sediments along with the samples of initial infilling sediments were preserved under low temperature 4 c conditions until geochemical and grain size analyses a flow chart of the adopted methods in the study has been shown in fig 4 2 3 porosity and permeability measurements porosity and permeability were measured both at the start initial parameters and at the end final parameters of the column experiment to monitor their changes due to sediment water interaction processes water saturation method was followed for measuring the porosity in sediment packed columns franklin 1979 matko 2004 the permeability of the columns were also measured at the start and end of the experiment by the falling head method tripathi and viswanadham 2012 each column saturated with the water was drained and the fall in water head in the reservoir placed over the column was monitored over the time the details of porosity and permeability measurements are explained in annexure 1 it may be noted that the porosity and permeability measurement were done at the beginning initial and after the completion end of the experiment and the finite data set represents the total changes in these parameters at the end of the experiment these changes however may not be evenly distributed throughout the experiment duration 2 4 analysis of water samples electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured immediately after the collection of pore water samples from the columns using a pre calibrated multi parameter system orion star a329 thermo fisher scientific the concentrations of major ions such as calcium ca chloride cl magnesium mg potassium k sodium na and sulfate so4 along with bromide br were measured in the pore water samples using ion chromatography system 883 basic ic plus metrohm the samples with higher ionic concentrations were analyzed after appropriate dilution alkalinity carbonate co3 and bicarbonate hco3 was determined by auto titrator 848 titrino plus metrohm following the titrimetric method rice et al 2017 additionally the concentrations of various trace elements including boron b barium ba lithium li manganese mn and strontium sr were measured in the pore water samples by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes 5110 agilent for precise measurements the analysis was carried out in triplicate mode and the analytical accuracy was checked by analyzing the known certified multi element standard solutions after every twenty water samples the hydrochemical data of the individual sample was further checked for the charge balance and the errors in the charge balance were found within the range of 5 the accuracy and precision of the instruments used for the analysis of water samples are provided in annexure 2 2 5 analysis of sediment samples the homogenized samples of the infilling sediments pre experiment and the sub sampled sediments recovered after completion of the column experiment post experiment were analyzed for element concentrations and grain size distribution the average of the measured values of the sub sampled sediments was used to represent the entire post experiment column sediments the analytical methods applied to the sediment samples are discussed in the following subsections 2 5 1 elemental analysis for the elemental analysis the sediment samples were completely digested in closed vessels with concentrated acids nearly 1 g of dried and homogenized sample was finely powdered in a ball mill rs 200 retsch finely powdered samples 0 3 g were taken in teflon tubes and ultra pure acids in a ratio of hf hcl hno3 3 2 1 were slowly added to each tube barik et al 2020 the sample acid mixture was then digested in the microwave digestion system multiwave pro anton paar a blank addition of acids without sediments was included in each digestion cycle to correct the effects of acids a certified reference material crm hiss 1 was also digested in parallel with the samples to verify the analytical results the microwave assisted sample digestion was carried out at 1300 w power with a ramp time of 20 minutes and a hold time of 50 minutes to neutralize hf 10 ml of boric acid solution 5 was added to each of the completely digested sample solutions the hf neutralization was carried out at 650 w power with a ramp time of 10 minutes and a hold time of 15 minutes the neutralized digested solution was filtered out using 0 45 µm polycarbonate membrane filter and various elements including ag al ba ca cd co cr cu fe k li mg mn na ni pb and sr were analyzed in the filtered solutions by the dual view icp oes the digested blanks were also included in the analysis after every 7 samples and the crm after every 14 samples the data accuracy was verified with the crm and the error percentage for the entire analysis was within 10 in the final data processing the elemental concentrations of the blanks were subtracted from each sample to negate any addition in element concentrations due to their presence in the acids used for digestion the concentrations of elements in the digested sediment mg l were finally converted into the sediment units mg kg 2 5 2 grain size analysis for grain size analysis 5 g of dried and homogenized sample was taken and the analysis was carried out in a wet medium using water as the dispersion medium by laser diffraction particle size analyzer partica la 950v2 horiba the refractive index was set as 1 54 quartz for the sediment samples and 1 333 water for the wet medium the analysis was carried out with a circulation speed of 7 and transmittance of lights varying between 80 90 agitation and ultra sonication were followed in some cases for the segregation of particles each sample was analyzed thrice and the average of the three analyses was considered as the grain size of the infilling sediments 2 6 identification of geochemical processes controlling pore water chemistry alternate injection of freshwater and seawater into the sediment filled columns column set m may lead to the mixing of freshwater and seawater as well as the interaction between the injected water and column sediments the freshwater seawater mixing was determined from the variation in pore water chemistry in column set m with reference to column sets f and s i e continuous freshwater seawater injections in order to understand the driving processes responsible for changes in pore water chemistry in the columns due to sediment water interaction the seawater fraction in each of the pore water was calculated using eq 1 appelo and postma 2005 for this purpose the freshwater and seawater used in the experiment were considered as two end members and cl as a conservative ion further from the calculated seawater fractions the expected concentrations of other elements and ions in the pore water due to seawater freshwater mixing were calculated eq 2 the deviation between the measured and expected concentrations was used to understand the geochemical processes apart from seawater freshwater mixing in controlling the pore water chemistry eq 3 1 f s e a c l p o r e c l f r e s h c l s e a c l f r e s h 2 i e f s e a i s e a 1 f s e a i f r e s h 3 i c h a n g e i p o r e i e where fsea indicates seawater fraction in pore water clpore clfresh and clsea stand for cl concentrations in pore water freshwater end member and seawater end member respectively for the ion element i ie is the expected concentration isea and ifresh are the concentrations in the seawater and freshwater end members respectively ichange stands for the deviation in concentration ipore stands for the measured concentration in the pore water precipitation and dissolution are some of the important processes associated to sediment water interaction the role of these processes in controlling pore water chemistry can be verified by estimating the saturation state of various mineral phases from the pore water chemistry saturation index si is a thermodynamic ion speciation model that determines the tendency of water to precipitate or dissolve mineral phases from the compositions of the aqueous solution klunk et al 2021 in the present study the si of mineral phases was calculated for the pore water of column set m using the phreeqc version 2 code with the default database phreeqc dat parkhurst and appelo 1999 the under saturated minerals si 0 have a tendency to remain in solution the saturated minerals si 0 remain in equilibrium and the over saturated minerals si 0 get precipitated zaidi et al 2015 3 results 3 1 pore water chemistry a summary of the physicochemical parameters measured in the collected pore waters and end members are presented in table 2 the pore waters collected from all columns show alkaline characteristics ph 7 table 2 the seawater ph 7 8 and freshwater ph 7 7 end members are also alkaline in nature on account of small changes in ph and alkalinity values of the end members small changes in the ph values of pore water have been observed between the freshening and the salinization events in the column experiment the ph values also show minor changes within the columns of column set m which have different proportions of sand silt and clay similar changes in ph values are also observed in column sets f and s the ec values show a clear difference between the freshwater and seawater injections in all columns the ec value ranges from 0 3 ms cm to 11 2 ms cm for the freshening event and 43 8 ms cm to 56 3 ms cm for the salinization event over the time in the column set m table 2 however the ec values remain nearly constant throughout the experiment duration in the column set f 0 2 0 4 ms cm and column set s 51 3 59 ms cm the major ion concentrations of the pore waters of all columns plotted against ec values clearly distinguish the freshwater and seawater injections in all columns fig 5 the concentrations of major ions calculated mathematically for different degrees of mixing between the end members are presented as a mixing line the major ion concentrations of the pore water show close resemblance to the compositions of the freshwater and seawater end members in the column sets f and s respectively however there is a slight increase in the major ion concentrations of the pore water in the column set f over time as a result of sediment water interaction fig 5 these observed changes are significant with respect to their lower concentrations in the freshwater end member on the other hand such changes in column set s are not significant with respect to their very high concentrations in the seawater end member as a result the major ion concentrations remain nearly constant and close to the seawater end member composition in the column set s fig 5 in the case of alternate freshwater seawater injections in column set m the major ion concentrations has increased significantly during the freshening event and decreased during the intrusion event from their respective concentrations in the freshwater and seawater end members this indicates that as compared to continuous freshwater seawater injections alternate freshwater seawater injections lead to higher sediment water interactions and thus higher mobilization fixing of elements takes place further the major ion concentrations in column set m follow the conservative mixing line during both freshening and salinization events this indicates the evolution of major ions by the seawater freshwater mixing process studies on coastal water have established a linkage between geochemical processes such as ion exchange and so4 reduction with the seawater freshwater mixing process that causes enrichment or depletion of ionic concentrations from the conservative mixing line prusty et al 2020 prusty and farooq 2020b it is further observed that the concentrations of all major ions except hco3 in pore water can separate the freshening and salinization events due to significant differences in their concentrations table 2 fig 5 the dominance of alkalinity hco3 values in coastal groundwater is generally indicative of freshwater parizi et al 2019 however in the present study hco3 concentrations in both end members are quite close and lead to an almost straight mixing line fig 5 further the pore waters have lower hco3 concentrations thus the hco3 concentrations could not be utilized for differentiating the freshening salinization events and understanding the freshening salinization process alkalinity may act as an effective indicator of freshwater in coastal regions only when there are significant differences in hco3 values in freshwater and seawater prusty et al 2018 the trace elements such as b ba br li mn and sr were present above the detection limit of 10 µg l in all pore waters of column sets m and s as well as in both end member waters table 2 however in the case of column set f elements including ba br and sr were present in more than 95 of the pore waters while b li and mn were detected in relatively fewer pore waters 40 the behavior of these trace elements in response to freshwater and seawater injections in the columns has clearly been observed in the concentration vs ec plot annexure 3 four of the trace elements b br li and sr show clear differences in their concentrations for the freshwater and seawater injections into the columns similar to the major ions the concentrations of these elements have slightly increased due to the freshwater injection in the pore waters of column set f and remain nearly constant due to the seawater injection in the column set s while their evolution followed the mixing line for alternate freshwater seawater injections in the column set m further there is an increase in their concentrations during the freshening stage of column set m therefore the higher concentrations of these elements in coastal groundwater can be an indicator of seawater influence further their similar evolution patterns to major ions indicate that similar geochemical processes control their behavior in the pore water the concentrations of ba and mn are found to be higher than the mixing line during both freshwater and seawater injections but the enrichment is relatively higher due to the seawater injection annexure 3 studies have shown that ba and mn concentrations in coastal water are controlled by the biogeochemical reactions in the coastal aquifer moore and joye 2021 higher sulfate concentrations in the injected seawater lead to a greater sulfate reduction process which simulates the reduction of metal oxides and causes mobilization of ions adsorbed onto the sediments 3 2 grain size distribution grain size distribution pattern plays a major role in the transportation of sediments which in turn affects the pore water chemistry liang et al 2020 from the grain size analysis it is found that the sand used for sample preparation has 97 sand and 3 medium course silt contents while the silt clay consists of 80 silt 19 clay and 1 very fine sand table 3 the percentage of silt and clay in the three column sediments a b and c was also known from the grain size analysis a relative change in grain size distribution pattern has been observed in all pre and post experiment column sediments the sand and clay percentages have decreased while the silt percent has increased in the post experiment column sediments table 3 the river sands are mainly composed of silica in the form of quartz which remains resistant to chemical weathering dipietro 2013 hossain et al 2017 thus the relative changes in grain size distribution are attributed to the changes in silt and clay fractions due to the dissolution precipitation of minerals in the column sediments these inferences are further supported by the observed higher changes in the grain size distribution in column a compared to columns b and c table 3 the column a with the highest silt clay contents has shown the maximum increase 5 6 in silt content while column c with minimum silt clay content shows the minimum increase 0 9 in silt content in the less silt clay containing columns i e b and c progressively lesser changes have been observed further these changes are relatively higher for the columns that are periodically exposed to freshwater and seawater such a trend indicates relatively increased reactivity and mineral precipitation in the columns due to exposure to alternate freshwater and seawater studies have demonstrated that the changes in grain size distribution affect the hydraulic properties of the aquifer including porosity and permeability coulson and richardson 2019 the changes in grain size distribution alter the sediment packing which results in variation in the porosity and permeability of the sediments the grain size changes observed in the present study indicate changes in the mineralogy of the column sediments which in turn may affect the porosity and permeability of the column sediments it is calculated that there will be a 5 25 change in the grain size distribution pattern in column c to column a if freshening and salinization continue for the next 100 cycles such a change will significantly affect the aquifer properties 3 3 elemental concentrations of sediments sediment water interaction plays a vital role in the mobilization of elements from the sediments the changes in the element concentrations in sediments or water indicate the degree of interaction between them pavoni et al 2021 thus the changes in the elemental concentrations in the column sediments were used to understand the changes in element concentrations of the pore water three of the 17 analyzed elements ag cd and co were present at very low concentrations 10 mg kg in all column sediments and also remained below the detection limits in the pore water the remaining 14 elements al ba ca cr cu fe k li mg mn na ni pb and sr were present in relatively higher concentrations 10 mg kg in the column sediments and are presented in table 3 the silt clay was found to have higher concentrations of most of the elements than the sand used in the column experiment table 3 studies have shown that with higher surface area fine grain materials have higher element concentrations liu et al 2019 the higher surface area of the finer materials provides higher number of sites for the adsorption of dissolved metals from the injected water however the mixing of silt clay and sand in different proportions led to variable element concentrations in the column sediments i e a b and c the concentrations of elements in the pre and post experiment column sediments show significant changes enrichment or depletion in their concentrations the enrichment depletion of the elements can be linked either to the precipitation and dissolution of minerals or to the adsorption and desorption of elements in the column sediments liu et al 2019 it is observed that the enrichment depletion behavior of elements in the column sediments with alternate freshwater seawater injections are quite different from the reference columns i e columns with freshwater seawater flow 4 discussion 4 1 evolution of hydrochemical facies the major ion concentrations of the pore waters of all columns were plotted in the piper diagram to understand the evolution of hydrochemical facies due to the injection of freshwater seawater in different columns piper 1944 the seawater and freshwater end members used in the experiment were characterized as na cl field ii and ca hco3 field i water types respectively fig 6 a it has been observed that the evolution of pore water facies are different in all three sets of columns fig 6a b the pore waters of the column set m have na cl characteristics during the salinization event while the water characteristics vary from na cl to ca na hco3 types during the freshening event the injected na cl water does not change during the salinization event and remains close to the composition of the seawater end member however during the freshening event the injected ca hco3 water moves towards na cl water type through ca na hco3 water type field iv such movement of water is caused due to the reduction of seawater influence as a result of freshwater flushing before the freshwater injection interestingly with the increase in the number of freshening salinization cycles i e towards the later stages of column experiment the injected ca hco3 water shows less evolution of water facies and remain in the field ii na cl water thus the impact of freshening has reduced and the salinization influence becomes more dominant in the freshening stage with the increase in experiment cycles therefore one flushing with freshwater is not sufficient to eliminate the impact of seawater before the freshening event however in the reference columns column sets f and s there is no change in the hydrochemical facies fig 6b the injected na cl water in column s remains on the same field and falls one above another in the piper diagram in case of column set f though the injected ca hco3 water type does not change however they show slight variation in their placement within the same field field ii of the piper diagram the evolution of water facies is also different within each set of the column with the variation in grain size distribution during the freshening stage in column set m the variation of water facies is limited for column c as compared to columns a and b fig 6a on the other hand the variation of water facies is relatively higher for column c than a and b in column set f fig 6b the decrease of sand percentage and increase of silt clay content from column c 90 to b 85 to a 80 may lead to an increase in sediment packing and a decrease in permeability within the columns luijendijk and gleeson 2015 studies have demonstrated that the sediments comprised of coarser grains like sand have a lesser surface area as compared to fine grains and have a high degree of inter connectivity among grains which allows easy flow of water through them glover and luo 2020 kashif et al 2019 conversely the sediments consisting of higher silt and clay fractions have lower permeability additionally the sediment water interaction will be higher in aquifers composed of more fine grain materials due to a higher contact time between the sediment and water higher sand and lesser silt clay contents in column c lead to less compact packing and high inter connectivity among the grains therefore it results in higher water exposure of the sediments in column c than the sediments in column b and column a during the injection of water into the columns the higher exposure of column cm as compared to columns am and bm to seawater during the salinization event leads to higher seawater influence resulting in less variation of water in the columns even during the freshening event similarly a steadily higher freshwater exposure due to freshwater injection in column set f leads to more variation of water in column cf than in columns af and bf to understand the effect of grain size distribution on pore water chemistry analysis of variance anova test was performed for this purpose the hydrochemical data of pore waters after normalization by box cox transformation has been utilized it is observed that all the parameters including trace elements except b and ba show significant changes p value 0 05 in their concentrations in the columns of column set m during the freshening event table 2 however during the salinization event the concentrations of water parameters except for ba are so high that their variations among the columns are not significant significant differences in the water parameters of the pore water are also observed in column sets f and s this suggests that the difference in grain size distributions in the columns is responsible for variations in the chemical characteristics of the pore water 4 2 changes in pore water chemistry with regard to reference columns all the columns were run concurrently under similar conditions thus a comparison of freshwater injections of column set f and seawater injections of column set s with the freshening and salinization events of column set m respectively will indicate the effect of periodic changes in water chemistry due to sediment water interactions for this purpose the chemical compositions of corresponding pore water of column sets f and s were subtracted from the pore water compositions of the freshening and salinization events of column set m respectively it is observed that all major ion concentrations have increased significantly ve deviation during the freshening event with respect to column set f and decreased ve deviation or equivalent deviation 0 to column set s during the salinization event annexure 4 this gives a clear indication of seawater freshwater mixing in addition to the sediment water interaction processes in the column set m therefore the pore water chemistry not only depends upon sediment water interaction but also been influenced by the characteristics of the inflowing water relatively higher enrichment of major ion concentrations in the freshening event is observed compared to their depletion in the salinization event as mentioned in section 2 2 in column set m the freshening and salinization events are preceded by the flushing of columns with respective waters which reduces the influence of seawater before the freshening event and the effect of freshwater before the salinization event the reduction of seawater influence by the freshwater flushing is much lesser than the reduction of freshwater influence by the seawater flushing this is caused due to very high dissolved constituents in the seawater which leads to a higher increase in major ion concentrations during the freshening event furthermore the influence of seawater increases with the increase in the experiment time period which is clearly visible in column c similar to major ions the trace elements including br sr b and li also show enrichments in their concentrations during the freshening event and depletion during the salinization event in the pore waters of column set m with respect to column sets f and s fig 7 these trace elements from the injected seawater in column set m get absorbed by the column sediments leading to a decrease in their concentrations in the pore water during the salinization process on the other hand the absorption of elements from seawater is less in column set s due to continuous seawater injection similarly the release of elements from column sediments during the freshening process leads to more enrichment of trace element concentrations in the pore water of column set m as compared to column set f therefore there are more deviations in the trace element concentrations of pore water of column set m due to alternate freshwater seawater injections while continuous freshwater seawater injections do not cause a significant change in trace element concentrations of pore water in reference columns set f and s the enrichments depletions are found to be relatively higher for br and b and lower for li and sr this is in accordance with their higher and lower concentrations in the injected seawater respectively boron and li concentration exhibits very prominent deviation for freshening and salinization events suggesting their possible usage as strong seawater tracers fig 7 it is also observed that the enrichments in their concentrations during the freshening event are significantly higher as compared to their concentrations in pore waters of column set f while their depletions are negligible with respect to the concentrations of the pore water in the column set s thus higher deviations in trace element concentrations during the freshening event is a clear indication of stronger seawater influence despite freshwater flushing furthermore the increasing seawater influence over time is more clearly observed from these trace element concentrations than the major ions the elements ba and mn show a very limited deviation in their concentrations during both freshening and salinization events in column set m with respect to the reference columns fig 7 therefore it is clear that alternate freshening and salinization events have a significant impact on the major ion and trace element concentrations of the pore water further the data also suggest that once saltwater intrusion has happened coastal aquifers would require a much longer time period to attenuate its impact by the freshening process 4 3 sediment water interaction 4 3 1 ion exchange process the preceding discussion clearly demonstrates that significant changes in the pore water chemistry in column set m occur due to alternate freshwater and seawater injections the role of ion exchange process in such changes in the pore water chemistry were observed from the deviation in pore water chemistry from the conservative seawater freshwater mixing the deviations between the measured and expected concentrations of major ions were plotted against the freshening salinization cycles fig 8 a f the changes in ca and mg concentrations are either negative or close to zero for the freshening event and positive for the salinization event fig 8a b however the deviations in na and k concentrations are positive for the freshening event and negative or close to zero for the salinization event fig 8c d these changes in major ions indicate the role of ion exchange process between the inflowing water and sediments in controlling the pore water chemistry the direct ion exchange during the freshening event results in elevated na and k concentrations positive deviation with depleted ca and mg concentrations negative deviation in the pore water in comparison to the seawater freshwater mixing subsequently the reverse ion exchange process causes enrichment of ca and mg with the depletion of na and k in the pore water during the salinization event the chemical reaction between the sediment and water for the direct ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes are represented in eq 4 and eq 5 respectively similar behavior of major ions as a result of ion exchange processes has also been reported in the coastal aquifers of laos morocco saudi arabia and several other regions brindha et al 2017 najib et al 2017 zaidi et al 2015 the deviations in mg and k concentrations are distinct and divergent for the freshening and salinization events in the three columns fig 8b d however the deviations are not well marked for na and ca especially in column c due to the higher inflow of water and very high na concentrations in the inflowing seawater the periodic reversal of enrichment and depletion of major ion concentrations indicate that the ion exchange processes are reversible with the change in the freshening and salinization events further the changes in their concentrations are more for the salinization event than the freshening event which indicates a higher degree of reverse ion exchange process therefore the reversal of ion exchange processes may not equilibrate the major ion concentrations between the freshening and salinization events due to the differential rate of ion exchange processes studies have shown that the reverse ion exchange process is a rapid process as compared to the direct ion exchange amiri et al 2016b 4 2 x n a s c a 2 a q x 2 c a s 2 n a a q 5 x 2 c a s 2 n a a q 2 x n a s c a 2 a q where x sediment exchanger s solid state aq aqueous media alkalinity i e hco3 only as co3 was not detected does not show significant changes 0 6 to 1 8 between the measured and expected concentrations during both freshening and salinization events fig 8e it is slightly enriched during the salinization event while both enrichment and depletion are observed during the freshening event similarly so4 concentrations have shown slight enrichment or depletion during both freshening and salinization events fig 8f however the changes in alkalinity and so4 concentrations do not follow any specific pattern for both events as well as for different columns these changes between the measured and expected concentrations are not remarkably distinct for the freshening salinization events and could be due to mineral precipitation and dissolution in the columns sola et al 2013 a sharp variation in the deviation patterns for these major ions has been observed towards the end of the experiment these variations suggest that with the increase in the sediment water interaction time the slow processes also started controlling the pore water chemistry and caused very significant changes in the pore water composition however a more detailed study involving a longer sediment water interaction time period is required to pin point those processes the expected concentrations of trace elements b ba br li mn and sr were also calculated from the conservative seawater freshwater mixing to understand their chemical behavior towards the freshening and salinization events bromide and sr are considered as good indicators of seawater and can be helpful in identifying the freshening and salinization events telahigue et al 2020 furthermore br also behaves as a conservative ion since it does not take part in redox reactions adsorption and precipitation processes souid et al 2018 it has been observed that br is nearly conservative deviation 0 in all three columns during the freshening event fig 9 a however some deviations from the conservative mixing have been observed during the salinization event which is negligible with respect to its very high concentrations in the respective pore water 60 mg l similar conservative behaviour has been observed from the deviation pattern of sr during the freshening event the deviations in sr concentrations are found to be close to zero during the freshening event while varying slightly during the salinization event fig 9b studies have shown that sr shows a conservative behaviour during the freshening process or non conservative behaviour similar to ca during the salinization process russak and sivan 2010 however slight variations in sr concentration during the salinization event are negligible with respect to sr concentrations of the pore water 4 mg l therefore both br and sr can effectively be used as conservative ions in mass balance calculation to estimate the expected concentrations due to the seawater freshwater mixing however they have not been used for conservative seawater freshwater mixing in this study due to their lower concentrations in the pore water of the freshening event the elements such as b and li have similar chemical behavior towards the freshening and salinization events for both elements the changes between the measured and expected concentrations are positive for the freshening event and negative for the salinization event fig 9c d the enrichment of b and li during the freshening event and vice versa during the salinization event indicates that ion exchange processes control their concentrations in the pore water russak et al 2016 these changes in concentrations are more distinct than the major ion concentrations na k ca and mg thus suggesting that the concentrations of b and li can be used as more sensitive seawater tracers in coastal groundwater it is also observed that the enrichment of b during the freshening event is almost equal to its depletion during the salinization event i e the concentration of b is reversible with the change in freshening and salinization events fig 9c however li concentration is irreversible due to its higher depletion during the salinization event than its enrichment during the freshening event fig 9d further with the increase in the duration of the experimental cycle the deviations in b concentrations increase and move away from the equilibrium line fig 9c on the other hand the deviations in li concentrations move close to the equilibrium line with the increase in the number of salinization events fig 9d the seawater usually gets significantly diluted and its composition gradually changes with its inland migration thus the gradual changes in b and li concentrations can be used to understand and monitor the intrusion of saltwater in the interior of the coastal regions 4 3 2 precipitation dissolution process similar changes in ba and mn concentrations have been observed during the freshening and salinization events their concentrations are enriched positive deviation during both events possibly due to their release from the column sediments fig 9e f the release of ba and mn hints at the mineral dissolution process which is more under seawater interaction i e during the salinization event moore and joye 2021 further the deviations in ba and mn show a decreasing trend towards the equilibrium line in the later stages of freshening or salinization cycles of the column experiment indicating a decrease in mineral dissolution over time the enrichment of ba is significantly higher during the salinization event and shows a clear difference from the freshening event fig 9e f therefore higher ba concentrations in coastal groundwater can provide clear information on extreme seawater events in the coastal regions since the enrichment of mn is not distinct for both events this may not help in the identification of the seawater freshwater mixing in coastal regions fig 9f the calculated si values suggest that the pore waters of column set m are under saturated with respect to halite nacl anhydrite caso4 and gypsum caso4 2h2o these mineral phases are more under saturated in the freshening event than the salinization event annexure 5 during the freshening event lower major ion na ca cl and so4 concentrations in the inflowing water generate highly under saturated conditions and trigger higher dissolution of these mineral phases similarly during the salinization event extremely higher major ion concentrations in the intruding seawater develop near saturation conditions and do not contribute significantly to the mineral dissolution process the carbonate mineral phases like calcite caco3 dolomite caco3 mgco3 and aragonite caco3 vary from near saturation to over saturation annexure 5 these mineral phases mostly remain close to the saturation line during the freshening event and are over saturated during the salinization event however higher si values of dolomite as compared to calcite and aragonite will lead to preferential precipitation of dolomite sola et al 2013 this is further supported by higher concentrations of mg than ca in the pore water of the salinization event studies have shown that dolomite precipitates readily under high mg concentrations and high si values su et al 2019 it has also been reported that higher so4 concentrations can enhance the dolomite precipitation process han et al 2018 thus it can be inferred that precipitation dissolution of the sulfate and carbonate mineral phases gypsum anhydrite and dolomite is responsible for the deviations in so4 and hco3 concentrations from the conservative mixing further the saturation states of mineral phases show more variations in the three columns during the freshening event while the changes are limited during the salinization event it is therefore clear from the saturation states of mineral phases that the dissolution and precipitation processes also play an important role in the sediment water interaction during the freshening and salinization events the geochemical processes controlling the pore water chemistry in the column experiment have been compared with the geochemical processes inferred from the water samples collected from the field for this purpose sixty seasonal groundwater and nine surface water samples were collected along the coastal track of puri district odisha india these samples have shown that seawater freshwater mixing along with the ion exchange process controls the groundwater chemistry during both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons prusty et al 2020 prusty and farooq 2020b the groundwater in the freshening stage indicates a significant role of the direct ion exchange process while the reverse ion exchange process controls the groundwater chemistry under the severe saltwater influence prusty et al 2020 moreover the surface waters flowing in the region are controlled by the simple binary mixing between freshwater and seawater without much intervention of the sediment water interaction prusty and farooq 2020b the validation of column experiment processes with the actual field conditions further adds value to the outcome of the column experiment 4 4 elemental changes in column sediments very high concentrations 15000 mg kg of al and fe have been observed in all three column sediments table 3 however the concentrations of these elements show a slight increase 1 2 in the post experiment sediments while they are depleted in the pore water with respect to the corresponding end members table 3 annexure 6 the enrichment of these elements in the sediments and depletion in the pore water indicates their removal from the pore water and subsequent adsorption precipitation on the sediments similarly the elements such as na ca and mg have shown an increase in their concentrations in the post experiment column sediments table 3 annexure 6 significantly high concentrations of na ca and mg in the seawater have led to their adsorption on sediments during the salinization event while they are released from the sediments during the freshening event this is further confirmed by the periodic enrichment and depletion in the concentration of these elements in the pore water with the change in freshening and salinization events the enrichment in their concentrations in the column sediments indicates that their retention is more than their release additionally si values calculated from the pore water during the salinization event show near saturation to over saturation for na ca and mg bearing minerals on the other hand k has shown reverse behavior i e depletion in the column sediments due to its relatively lower concentration in the seawater compared to other major ions table 3 annexure 6 higher desorption during the freshening event than adsorption during the salinization event resulted in the depletion of k concentration in the post experiment column sediments the concentrations of ba and mn are depleted in the post experiment sediments which are correlated to their enrichment in the pore water table 3 annexure 6 the changes in concentrations of the remaining elements are insignificant on account of their lower concentrations 100 mg kg in the sediments table 3 annexure 6 thus these changes are not prominently reflected in the pore water from the above discussion it is inferred that the elemental concentrations in the column sediments have been changed due to the injection of water into the columns and these changes are interrelated to the changes in the pore water chemistry however some of the elements show very less change due to their lower concentrations both in sediment and injecting waters 4 5 porosity and permeability porosity and permeability are important parameters that control the flow of water through the aquifer the changes in pore water chemistry and sediments have a direct impact on aquifer porosity and permeability yuan et al 2019 the porosity and permeability of column sediments measured at the beginning initial and completion final of the experiment are shown in fig 10 a b both the initial and final values of porosity and permeability show an increasing trend from column a to column b to column c which is in accordance with the grain size distribution in the column sediments further the column sediments show a substantial change between the initial and final values of porosity and permeability these changes are less in column a which subsequently increases in column b and column c porosity has increased in the columns with the freshwater flow and decreased in the columns with seawater flow and alternate freshwater seawater injections fig 10a this indicates that the decrease in porosity is resulted due to the interaction of seawater with the sediments however permeability is found to be decreased in all columns at the end of the experiment fig 10b the varying degree of changes in porosity and permeability in the columns could be due to the mineralogical changes that are reflected in the form of grain size distribution and also in element concentrations in the sediments and pore water the negative changes in porosity and permeability associated with the seawater indicate that it may bring severe changes in the coastal aquifer characteristics over time and require higher attention 5 conclusions coastal aquifers face frequent and periodic fluctuations in the seawater freshwater interface this alternatingly exposes the near interface aquifer sediments to freshwater and seawater drastically different chemistry of these waters forces sediments to equilibrate and re equilibrate with the prevailing water chemistry during each cycle the present study investigates the effect of these frequent sediment water interactions on pore water chemistry and properties i e porosity and permeability of the coastal aquifer to simulate the natural conditions in the laboratory sediment filled columns were periodically exposed to freshwater and seawater over a year it has been observed that periodic freshening and salinization cause significant changes in the pore water chemistry the effect of a single salinization event may require several freshwater flushing to bring back the pore water chemistry to its initial composition the alternate exposure of sediments to freshwater seawater triggers processes such as ion exchange mineral precipitation dissolution and elemental adsorption desorption that controls the pore water chemistry the major ions na k ca and mg along with some trace elements b and li in the pore water are found to be associated with the ion exchange process while the mineral precipitation dissolution process controls hco3 so4 ba and mn concentrations the study further highlights that the ion exchange processes are reversible in addition to the traditional major ions trace elements including b ba li mn and sr have been identified as highly sensitive markers for an effective detection of extreme saltwater intrusions in the inland areas the changes in pore water chemistry also bring changes in aquifer properties such as grain size distribution and elemental concentrations further it has been observed that the changes in grain size distribution significantly affected the porosity and permeability of the sediments therefore frequent changes in freshening and salinization in the long run not only will lead to severe changes in the coastal groundwater quality but also in its storativity and transmissivity this may aggravate the freshwater scarcity in the coastal regions the findings of the present study have a global applicability as the columns with different sediment compositions can represent a wide variety of coastal aquifers the changes in porosity and permeability in the aquifer sediments may provide the scientists an opportunity to model its long term effect on subsurface storage and movement of groundwater seawater and policy holders to manage the coastal

3925,the coastal aquifers experience periodic freshening and salinization events due to frequent changes in hydrological conditions such frequent changes have vital effects on the coastal groundwater quality and aquifer properties this forms the basis of the present study laboratory based column experiments have been conducted to investigate the long term impact of such periodic events on coastal groundwater quality and aquifer sediment characteristics conditions similar to the natural coastal aquifer systems were generated in sediment filled columns by injecting freshwater and seawater periodically changes in pore water chemistry and sediment properties were monitored over a period of one year it has been observed that periodic injections of freshwater freshening and seawater salinization caused significant changes in the pore water chemistry mainly due to sediment water interactions in addition to seawater freshwater mixing geochemical processes such as ion exchange mineral precipitation dissolution and adsorption desorption of elements have been identified to control the pore water chemistry trace elements including barium boron bromide lithium and strontium have been identified as effective tracers for monitoring the saltwater intrusion further the changes in pore water chemistry are found to be interlinked with the changes in aquifer properties it is observed that with the increase in the number of salinization cycles the effectiveness of the freshening process to bring back the original aquifer pore water chemistry diminishes and the impact of salinization lasts longer at the end of the experiment changes in the porosity and permeability of the sediments have been observed such changes in the aquifer properties may affect the specific yield and storativity of the aquifer keywords coastal aquifer hydrochemical processes saltwater intrusion sediment water interaction column experiment 1 introduction saltwater intrusion in the coastal aquifers leads to the loss of freshwater resources and is a major cause of concern globally the water demand in coastal cities is increasing exponentially mainly due to rapid population growth associated with large scale migration and improved living standards zume et al 2021 to meet this ever increasing water demand existing groundwater resources are exploited indiscriminately and bringing them under stress this aggravating problem has attracted significant scientific attention and investigations on various aspects of saltwater intrusion have been conducted the complex aquifer geometry high ionic strength of water along with the involvement of a multi component system make these studies highly challenging sajil kumar 2016 a number of studies involving field surveys laboratory experiments and hydrochemical modeling have been undertaken across the globe the field surveys have been especially successful in assessing saltwater intrusion on local scales kazakis et al 2016 mohanty and gurunadha rao 2019 najib et al 2017 however for larger areas this approach being time consuming did not provide an appreciable outcome in a few studies natural coastal systems have been established through laboratory experiments and saltwater intrusion under different hydrological conditions has been investigated the behavior of seawater freshwater mixing mastrocicco et al 2012 solute transport anderson et al 2005 groundwater flow oz et al 2014 nutrient exchange russak et al 2015 the efficiency of subsurface barriers to prevent saltwater intrusion li et al 2018 etc are some of the issues addressed through such laboratory based experiments the modeling studies have been applied to understand the role of sea level rise tidal influence groundwater overexploitation etc on saltwater intrusion rajaveni et al 2016 shen et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 despite extensive research due to the complexity of processes at local and regional scales no standard protocol exists that can be applied universally to have a comprehensive understanding of the saltwater intrusion problems thus each area needs to be investigated individually the saltwater intrusion occurs in coastal aquifers when the hydrodynamic balance between the freshwater and seawater maintained by the freshwater seawater interface zone gets disturbed naik 2018 the depth of the freshwater seawater interface depends upon the density contrast between the freshwater and seawater and the height of the water table above the mean sea level fig 1 ghyben 1889 herzberg 1901 studies have shown that frequent fluctuation in the water table occurs due to seasonal and diurnal changes in groundwater recharge and extraction prusty and farooq 2020a the behaviour of freshwater seawater interface to groundwater recharge and discharge conditions is shown in fig 1 changes in regional and global scale phenomena such as climate change sea level rise coastal flooding shoreline erosion storm surge etc also affect the water table in coastal regions grases et al 2020 in response to these water table fluctuations the freshwater seawater interface moves up or down frequently throughout the year this in turn exposes the coastal aquifer sediments periodically to freshwater and seawater conditions fig 1 the freshwater and seawater have significant differences in their chemistry i e ph ec and chemical composition thus the periodic exposure of coastal aquifer sediments to the prevailing water may affect the geochemical processes such as adsorption ion exchange breakdown dissolution of existing minerals and formation of new minerals due to differential saltwater freshwater interaction with the aquifer sediments amiri et al 2016a sajil kumar 2016 these processes not only affect the coastal groundwater chemistry but may also bring irreversible changes in vital aquifer properties such as porosity and permeability any change in aquifer parameters such as reduction or increase in permeability near the interface may significantly influence the movement of saltwater into the coastal aquifers since the damages caused to the aquifer and subsequently to agricultural land by seawater ingression are difficult to reverse it is very necessary to have a detailed understanding of the geochemical processes that occur in the aquifer and control the groundwater pore water chemistry and may affect the aquifer properties for the understanding of the sediment water interaction processes and their effects on the pore water quality a few laboratory based experimental studies involving sediment filled tanks and columns have been conducted these studies enhanced the scientific understanding of various aspects including the behavior of contaminants in coastal aquifers zhang et al 2002 mapping of contaminant transport due to saltwater movement chang and clement 2013 observing the groundwater flow patterns within the freshwater saltwater interface oz et al 2015 geochemical evolution of coastal water ronen eliraz et al 2017 and understanding of mass transfer processes at the sediment water interface drouin et al 2021 further column experiments have been conducted to study how the freshening and salinization processes in coastal aquifers modify the pore water chemistry boluda botella et al 2008 russak et al 2016 russak and sivan 2010 it is important to note that in these studies the column experiment sediment water interaction experiment was run for a shorter time period 1 2 months with a close sampling interval such experimental conditions have provided a very limited time for the water to interact with the sediments under these circumstances many of the slow processes that occur in the natural system may not get recorded or get over shadowed by quick and dominant processes such as seawater freshwater mixing thus for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of periodic freshening and saltwater intrusion on the pore water chemistry it is of vital importance that the sediment water interaction should be monitored over a longer time period further the repeated equilibrium and re equilibrium of the aquifer sediments with periodically changing water chemistry may affect the porosity and permeability which has never been investigated the change in the porosity and permeability may affect the specific storage and specific yield of the aquifer to fill these gaps in scientific understanding a column experiment based study has been conducted in this study sediment filled columns were made to interact with seawater and freshwater alternatively over a period of one year with the aims to i evaluate the impact of periodic freshening salinization on the pore water chemistry and aquifer sediments ii understand the role of geochemical processes in controlling the coastal aquifer properties and iii determine the changes in vital aquifer parameters i e porosity and permeability due to periodic freshening and salinization of aquifer sediments the outcome of the column experiment study has been verified through the field observations thus the present study provides a detailed understanding of the effects of periodic freshening salinization on the coastal aquifers such an understanding will help in devising a long term and sustainable solution for the efficient management of coastal water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation it is well known that the coastal aquifers are mainly composed of sand with a minor amount of silt and clay content ganesan et al 2014 in view of this sand silt and clay fractions were mixed in different weight proportions to prepare the sediments representative of a wide variety of the coastal aquifers further detail in table 1 these sediments were then used as infilling material in the columns sand samples were collected from the daya river that falls into the bay of bengal india while silt and clay fractions were extracted from the nearby subsurface sediments 3 m depth by sieving technique 63 µm bigger size particles from the sand were removed by sieving it with a 250 µm sieve fresh groundwater collected from an inland area odisha india and seawater from the bay of bengal were injected periodically into these sediment filled columns to simulate the natural coastal aquifer system in the laboratory through the column experiment the sediment and water samples were collected during the summer season april 2018 the sample collection sites are shown in fig 2 2 2 column experiment description the experimental setup involving nine standalone columns internal diameter 5 cm length 40 cm was fabricated for the laboratory column experiment three sets of columns were made with each set consisting of three columns a b and c column a of each set contained a mixture of 80 sand and 20 silt clay similarly column b of each set had 85 sand and 15 silt clay while column c of each set was filled with 90 sand and 10 silt clay for developing the homogenous media the sediments were slowly packed into thin layers 1 cm followed by soft compaction with a pestle oliviera et al 1996 silicon tubes were connected to small openings made at both ends of each column casings to facilitate the inflow and outflow of water through the column sediments porous plastic disks were placed at both ends of the column to facilitate the uniform distribution of inflowing water and prevent any loss of sediments with the outflowing water fig 3 a the water was injected into the columns with the help of peristaltic pumps the schematics of the column experiment and view of the actual column experiment in the laboratory are shown in fig 3a b in the first column set freshwater was injected named as column set f while in the second column set seawater was injected named as column set s throughout the experiment duration however in the third set of columns freshwater and seawater were injected alternatively named as column set m this way the experiment was run simultaneously for all three column sets the notations for all columns are presented in table 1 in all columns the flow of water was maintained from bottom to top with a flow rate of 1 ml min with the help of peristaltic pumps bottom to top flow with a low flow rate was opted to facilitate maximum sediment water interaction and minimal preferential flow of injected water through the column walls russak et al 2015 the injection of water was stopped 30 minutes after attaining the complete saturation and overflow in the columns consequently the silicon tubes at both ends were blocked i e sealed to entrap the water in the columns and facilitate the sediment water interaction after a specific time period the silicon tubes were unblocked from both ends which let the columns drain naturally the drained waters were collected as samples termed as pore water hereafter before the next injection the pore water collected from the columns represents the groundwater that exists in the coastal aquifers under natural conditions in column set m the seawater was injected after the natural draining of the freshwater and vice versa for the entire duration of the experiment however to eliminate the effect of the freshwater retained in these columns as adsorbed or held in interstitial spaces due to cohesion capillary action the columns were first saturated with seawater 1st injection and drained immediately subsequently they were saturated again with seawater 2nd injection for sediment water interaction pore water samples were collected at the time of draining the 2nd injection after a specified time period the same practice has been followed while injecting the freshwater to minimize the effect of retained seawater in the columns the alternate exposure of column m sediments to freshwater and seawater mimics the natural condition that the aquifer sediments experience due to periodic fluctuation of the seawater freshwater interface in the coastal regions the replacement of freshwater by seawater in these three columns am bm and cm represents the salinization event while the replacement of seawater by freshwater indicates the freshening event column sets f and s have been run as reference columns thus were injected only with freshwater and seawater respectively throughout the experiment period in response to various geological and climatological processes the salinization and freshening of coastal aquifers varies widely in space and time thus there cannot be a specific time interval for salinization and freshening that can be applied universally in the initial stage of the experiment the injection and sample collection were followed at two days intervals for the first 28 days of the experiment at the start of the experiment quicker sediment water interaction processes were expected to control the pore water chemistry thus salinization and freshening with shorter interval was planned to monitor these processes more closely however in the later stages the injection and sample collection interval was subsequently increased to four days for the next 24 days two weeks for the next 16 weeks and four weeks for the last 32 weeks for higher exposure of sediments to different water conditions for monitoring of slower processes with these intervals the experiment was conducted continuously for a period of 56 weeks with the devised execution plan the entire experiment period includes 18 freshening and 18 salinization events in column set m however due to the absence of alternate freshwater and saline water injections the column sets f and s had 36 freshwater and 36 seawater injections respectively a total of 324 pore water samples were collected from all three column sets during the entire experiment period this includes 108 samples from each set of columns i e 36 samples from each column each sampling involves collecting 25 30 ml of pore water from each column and filtering it with 0 45 µm polycarbonate membrane filters the filtered pore water samples were sub sampled into two parts non acidified and acidified with ultrapure hno3 for the analysis of anions and cations respectively these water samples were stored at low temperatures 4 c in polyethylene vials until their analysis the stock freshwater and seawater used in the experiment for injection purposes were also analyzed after the completion of the experiment the sediments were recovered from each column the recovered sediments from each column were sub sampled into three parts bottom middle and top and packed in zip locked bags these sub sampled sediments along with the samples of initial infilling sediments were preserved under low temperature 4 c conditions until geochemical and grain size analyses a flow chart of the adopted methods in the study has been shown in fig 4 2 3 porosity and permeability measurements porosity and permeability were measured both at the start initial parameters and at the end final parameters of the column experiment to monitor their changes due to sediment water interaction processes water saturation method was followed for measuring the porosity in sediment packed columns franklin 1979 matko 2004 the permeability of the columns were also measured at the start and end of the experiment by the falling head method tripathi and viswanadham 2012 each column saturated with the water was drained and the fall in water head in the reservoir placed over the column was monitored over the time the details of porosity and permeability measurements are explained in annexure 1 it may be noted that the porosity and permeability measurement were done at the beginning initial and after the completion end of the experiment and the finite data set represents the total changes in these parameters at the end of the experiment these changes however may not be evenly distributed throughout the experiment duration 2 4 analysis of water samples electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured immediately after the collection of pore water samples from the columns using a pre calibrated multi parameter system orion star a329 thermo fisher scientific the concentrations of major ions such as calcium ca chloride cl magnesium mg potassium k sodium na and sulfate so4 along with bromide br were measured in the pore water samples using ion chromatography system 883 basic ic plus metrohm the samples with higher ionic concentrations were analyzed after appropriate dilution alkalinity carbonate co3 and bicarbonate hco3 was determined by auto titrator 848 titrino plus metrohm following the titrimetric method rice et al 2017 additionally the concentrations of various trace elements including boron b barium ba lithium li manganese mn and strontium sr were measured in the pore water samples by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes 5110 agilent for precise measurements the analysis was carried out in triplicate mode and the analytical accuracy was checked by analyzing the known certified multi element standard solutions after every twenty water samples the hydrochemical data of the individual sample was further checked for the charge balance and the errors in the charge balance were found within the range of 5 the accuracy and precision of the instruments used for the analysis of water samples are provided in annexure 2 2 5 analysis of sediment samples the homogenized samples of the infilling sediments pre experiment and the sub sampled sediments recovered after completion of the column experiment post experiment were analyzed for element concentrations and grain size distribution the average of the measured values of the sub sampled sediments was used to represent the entire post experiment column sediments the analytical methods applied to the sediment samples are discussed in the following subsections 2 5 1 elemental analysis for the elemental analysis the sediment samples were completely digested in closed vessels with concentrated acids nearly 1 g of dried and homogenized sample was finely powdered in a ball mill rs 200 retsch finely powdered samples 0 3 g were taken in teflon tubes and ultra pure acids in a ratio of hf hcl hno3 3 2 1 were slowly added to each tube barik et al 2020 the sample acid mixture was then digested in the microwave digestion system multiwave pro anton paar a blank addition of acids without sediments was included in each digestion cycle to correct the effects of acids a certified reference material crm hiss 1 was also digested in parallel with the samples to verify the analytical results the microwave assisted sample digestion was carried out at 1300 w power with a ramp time of 20 minutes and a hold time of 50 minutes to neutralize hf 10 ml of boric acid solution 5 was added to each of the completely digested sample solutions the hf neutralization was carried out at 650 w power with a ramp time of 10 minutes and a hold time of 15 minutes the neutralized digested solution was filtered out using 0 45 µm polycarbonate membrane filter and various elements including ag al ba ca cd co cr cu fe k li mg mn na ni pb and sr were analyzed in the filtered solutions by the dual view icp oes the digested blanks were also included in the analysis after every 7 samples and the crm after every 14 samples the data accuracy was verified with the crm and the error percentage for the entire analysis was within 10 in the final data processing the elemental concentrations of the blanks were subtracted from each sample to negate any addition in element concentrations due to their presence in the acids used for digestion the concentrations of elements in the digested sediment mg l were finally converted into the sediment units mg kg 2 5 2 grain size analysis for grain size analysis 5 g of dried and homogenized sample was taken and the analysis was carried out in a wet medium using water as the dispersion medium by laser diffraction particle size analyzer partica la 950v2 horiba the refractive index was set as 1 54 quartz for the sediment samples and 1 333 water for the wet medium the analysis was carried out with a circulation speed of 7 and transmittance of lights varying between 80 90 agitation and ultra sonication were followed in some cases for the segregation of particles each sample was analyzed thrice and the average of the three analyses was considered as the grain size of the infilling sediments 2 6 identification of geochemical processes controlling pore water chemistry alternate injection of freshwater and seawater into the sediment filled columns column set m may lead to the mixing of freshwater and seawater as well as the interaction between the injected water and column sediments the freshwater seawater mixing was determined from the variation in pore water chemistry in column set m with reference to column sets f and s i e continuous freshwater seawater injections in order to understand the driving processes responsible for changes in pore water chemistry in the columns due to sediment water interaction the seawater fraction in each of the pore water was calculated using eq 1 appelo and postma 2005 for this purpose the freshwater and seawater used in the experiment were considered as two end members and cl as a conservative ion further from the calculated seawater fractions the expected concentrations of other elements and ions in the pore water due to seawater freshwater mixing were calculated eq 2 the deviation between the measured and expected concentrations was used to understand the geochemical processes apart from seawater

ie is the expected concentration isea and ifresh are the concentrations in the seawater and freshwater end members respectively ichange stands for the deviation in concentration ipore stands for the measured concentration in the pore water precipitation and dissolution are some of the important processes associated to sediment water interaction the role of these processes in controlling pore water chemistry can be verified by estimating the saturation state of various mineral phases from the pore water chemistry saturation index si is a thermodynamic ion speciation model that determines the tendency of water to precipitate or dissolve mineral phases from the compositions of the aqueous solution klunk et al 2021 in the present study the si of mineral phases was calculated for the pore water of column set m using the phreeqc version 2 code with the default database phreeqc dat parkhurst and appelo 1999 the under saturated minerals si 0 have a tendency to remain in solution the saturated minerals si 0 remain in equilibrium and the over saturated minerals si 0 get precipitated zaidi et al 2015 3 results 3 1 pore water chemistry a summary of the physicochemical parameters measured in the collected pore waters and end members are presented in table 2 the pore waters collected from all columns show alkaline characteristics ph 7 table 2 the seawater ph 7 8 and freshwater ph 7 7 end members are also alkaline in nature on account of small changes in ph and alkalinity values of the end members small changes in the ph values of pore water have been observed between the freshening and the salinization events in the column experiment the ph values also show minor changes within the columns of column set m which have different proportions of sand silt and clay similar changes in ph values are also observed in column sets f and s the ec values show a clear difference between the freshwater and seawater injections in all columns the ec value ranges from 0 3 ms cm to 11 2 ms cm for the freshening event and 43 8 ms cm to 56 3 ms cm for the salinization event over the time in the column set m table 2 however the ec values remain nearly constant throughout the experiment duration in the column set f 0 2 0 4 ms cm and column set s 51 3 59 ms cm the major ion concentrations of the pore waters of all columns plotted against ec values clearly distinguish the freshwater and seawater injections in all columns fig 5 the concentrations of major ions calculated mathematically for different degrees of mixing between the end members are presented as a mixing line the major ion concentrations of the pore water show close resemblance to the compositions of the freshwater and seawater end members in the column sets f and s respectively however there is a slight increase in the major ion concentrations of the pore water in the column set f over time as a result of sediment water interaction fig 5 these observed changes are significant with respect to their lower concentrations in the freshwater end member on the other hand such changes in column set s are not significant with respect to their very high concentrations in the seawater end member as a result the major ion concentrations remain nearly constant and close to the seawater end member composition in the column set s fig 5 in the case of alternate freshwater seawater injections in column set m the major ion concentrations has increased significantly during the freshening event and decreased during the intrusion event from their respective concentrations in the freshwater and seawater end members this indicates that as compared to continuous freshwater seawater injections alternate freshwater seawater injections lead to higher sediment water interactions and thus higher mobilization fixing of elements takes place further the major ion concentrations in column set m follow the conservative mixing line during both freshening and salinization events this indicates the evolution of major ions by the seawater freshwater mixing process studies on coastal water have established a linkage between geochemical processes such as ion exchange and so4 reduction with the seawater freshwater mixing process that causes enrichment or depletion of ionic concentrations from the conservative mixing line prusty et al 2020 prusty and farooq 2020b it is further observed that the concentrations of all major ions except hco3 in pore water can separate the freshening and salinization events due to significant differences in their concentrations table 2 fig 5 the dominance of alkalinity hco3 values in coastal groundwater is generally indicative of freshwater parizi et al 2019 however in the present study hco3 concentrations in both end members are quite close and lead to an almost straight mixing line fig 5 further the pore waters have lower hco3 concentrations thus the hco3 concentrations could not be utilized for differentiating the freshening salinization events and understanding the freshening salinization process alkalinity may act as an effective indicator of freshwater in coastal regions only when there are significant differences in hco3 values in freshwater and seawater prusty et al 2018 the trace elements such as b ba br li mn and sr were present above the detection limit of 10 µg l in all pore waters of column sets m and s as well as in both end member waters table 2 however in the case of column set f elements including ba br and sr were present in more than 95 of the pore waters while b li and mn were detected in relatively fewer pore waters 40 the behavior of these trace elements in response to freshwater and seawater injections in the columns has clearly been observed in the concentration vs ec plot annexure 3 four of the trace elements b br li and sr show clear differences in their concentrations for the freshwater and seawater injections into the columns similar to the major ions the concentrations of these elements have slightly increased due to the freshwater injection in the pore waters of column set f and remain nearly constant due to the seawater injection in the column set s while their evolution followed the mixing line for alternate freshwater seawater injections in the column set m further there is an increase in their concentrations during the freshening stage of column set m therefore the higher concentrations of these elements in coastal groundwater can be an indicator of seawater influence further their similar evolution patterns to major ions indicate that similar geochemical processes control their behavior in the pore water the concentrations of ba and mn are found to be higher than the mixing line during both freshwater and seawater injections but the enrichment is relatively higher due to the seawater injection annexure 3 studies have shown that ba and mn concentrations in coastal water are controlled by the biogeochemical reactions in the coastal aquifer moore and joye 2021 higher sulfate concentrations in the injected seawater lead to a greater sulfate reduction process which simulates the reduction of metal oxides and causes mobilization of ions adsorbed onto the sediments 3 2 grain size distribution grain size distribution pattern plays a major role in the transportation of sediments which in turn affects the pore water chemistry liang et al 2020 from the grain size analysis it is found that the sand used for sample preparation has 97 sand and 3 medium course silt contents while the silt clay consists of 80 silt 19 clay and 1 very fine sand table 3 the percentage of silt and clay in the three column sediments a b and c was also known from the grain size analysis a relative change in grain size distribution pattern has been observed in all pre and post experiment column sediments the sand and clay percentages have decreased while the silt percent has increased in the post experiment column sediments table 3 the river sands are mainly composed of silica in the form of quartz which remains resistant to chemical weathering dipietro 2013 hossain et al 2017 thus the relative changes in grain size distribution are attributed to the changes in silt and clay fractions due to the dissolution precipitation of minerals in the column sediments these inferences are further supported by the observed higher changes in the grain size distribution in column a compared to columns b and c table 3 the column a with the highest silt clay contents has shown the maximum increase 5 6 in silt content while column c with minimum silt clay content shows the minimum increase 0 9 in silt content in the less silt clay containing columns i e b and c progressively lesser changes have been observed further these changes are relatively higher for the columns that are periodically exposed to freshwater and seawater such a trend indicates relatively increased reactivity and mineral precipitation in the columns due to exposure to alternate freshwater and seawater studies have demonstrated that the changes in grain size distribution affect the hydraulic properties of the aquifer including porosity and permeability coulson and richardson 2019 the changes in grain size distribution alter the sediment packing which results in variation in the porosity and permeability of the sediments the grain size changes observed in the present study indicate changes in the mineralogy of the column sediments which in turn may affect the porosity and permeability of the column sediments it is calculated that there will be a 5 25 change in the grain size distribution pattern in column c to column a if freshening and salinization continue for the next 100 cycles such a change will significantly affect the aquifer properties 3 3 elemental concentrations of sediments sediment water interaction plays a vital role in the mobilization of elements from the sediments the changes in the element concentrations in sediments or water indicate the degree of interaction between them pavoni et al 2021 thus the changes in the elemental concentrations in the column sediments were used to understand the changes in element concentrations of the pore water three of the 17 analyzed elements ag cd and co were present at very low concentrations 10 mg kg in all column sediments and also remained below the detection limits in the pore water the remaining 14 elements al ba ca cr cu fe k li mg mn na ni pb and sr were present in relatively higher concentrations 10 mg kg in the column sediments and are presented in table 3 the silt clay was found to have higher concentrations of most of the elements than the sand used in the column experiment table 3 studies have shown that with higher surface area fine grain materials have higher element concentrations liu et al 2019 the higher surface area of the finer materials provides higher number of sites for the adsorption of dissolved metals from the injected water however the mixing of silt clay and sand in different proportions led to variable element concentrations in the column sediments i e a b and c the concentrations of elements in the pre and post experiment column sediments show significant changes enrichment or depletion in their concentrations the enrichment depletion of the elements can be linked either to the precipitation and dissolution of minerals or to the adsorption and desorption of elements in the column sediments liu et al 2019 it is observed that the enrichment depletion behavior of elements in the column sediments with alternate freshwater seawater injections are quite different from the reference columns i e columns with freshwater seawater flow 4 discussion 4 1 evolution of hydrochemical facies the major ion concentrations of the pore waters of all columns were plotted in the piper diagram to understand the evolution of hydrochemical facies due to the injection of freshwater seawater in different columns piper 1944 the seawater and freshwater end members used in the experiment were characterized as na cl field ii and ca hco3 field i water types respectively fig 6 a it has been observed that the evolution of pore water facies are different in all three sets of columns fig 6a b the pore waters of the column set m have na cl characteristics during the salinization event while the water characteristics vary from na cl to ca na hco3 types during the freshening event the injected na cl water does not change during the salinization event and remains close to the composition of the seawater end member however during the freshening event the injected ca hco3 water moves towards na cl water type through ca na hco3 water type field iv such movement of water is caused due to the reduction of seawater influence as a result of freshwater flushing before the freshwater injection interestingly with the increase in the number of freshening salinization cycles i e towards the later stages of column experiment the injected ca hco3 water shows less evolution of water facies and remain in the field ii na cl water thus the impact of freshening has reduced and the salinization influence becomes more dominant in the freshening stage with the increase in experiment cycles therefore one flushing with freshwater is not sufficient to eliminate the impact of seawater before the freshening event however in the reference columns column sets f and s there is no change in the hydrochemical facies fig 6b the injected na cl water in column s remains on the same field and falls one above another in the piper diagram in case of column set f though the injected ca hco3 water type does not change however they show slight variation in their placement within the same field field ii of the piper diagram the evolution of water facies is also different within each set of the column with the variation in grain size distribution during the freshening stage in column set m the variation of water facies is limited for column c as compared to columns a and b fig 6a on the other hand the variation of water facies is relatively higher for column c than a and b in column set f fig 6b the decrease of sand percentage and increase of silt clay content from column c 90 to b 85 to a 80 may lead to an increase in sediment packing and a decrease in permeability within the columns luijendijk and gleeson 2015 studies have demonstrated that the sediments comprised of coarser grains like sand have a lesser surface area as compared to fine grains and have a high degree of inter connectivity among grains which allows easy flow of water through them glover and luo 2020 kashif et al 2019 conversely the sediments consisting of higher silt and clay fractions have lower permeability additionally the sediment water interaction will be higher in aquifers composed of more fine grain materials due to a higher contact time between the sediment and water higher sand and lesser silt clay contents in column c lead to less compact packing and high inter connectivity among the grains therefore it results in higher water exposure of the sediments in column c than the sediments in column b and column a during the injection of water into the columns the higher exposure of column cm as compared to columns am and bm to seawater during the salinization event leads to higher seawater influence resulting in less variation of water in the columns even during the freshening event similarly a steadily higher freshwater exposure due to freshwater injection in column set f leads to more variation of water in column cf than in columns af and bf to understand the effect of grain size distribution on pore water chemistry analysis of variance anova test was performed for this purpose the hydrochemical data of pore waters after normalization by box cox transformation has been utilized it is observed that all the parameters including trace elements except b and ba show significant changes p value 0 05 in their concentrations in the columns of column set m during the freshening event table 2 however during the salinization event the concentrations of water parameters except for ba are so high that their variations among the columns are not significant significant differences in the water parameters of the pore water are also observed in column sets f and s this suggests that the difference in grain size distributions in the columns is responsible for variations in the chemical characteristics of the pore water 4 2 changes in pore water chemistry with regard to reference columns all the columns were run concurrently under similar conditions thus a comparison of freshwater injections of column set f and seawater injections of column set s with the freshening and salinization events of column set m respectively will indicate the effect of periodic changes in water chemistry due to sediment water interactions for this purpose the chemical compositions of corresponding pore water of column sets f and s were subtracted from the pore water compositions of the freshening and salinization events of column set m respectively it is observed that all major ion concentrations have increased significantly ve deviation during the freshening event with respect to column set f and decreased ve deviation or equivalent deviation 0 to column set s during the salinization event annexure 4 this gives a clear indication of seawater freshwater mixing in addition to the sediment water interaction processes in the column set m therefore the pore water chemistry not only depends upon sediment water interaction but also been influenced by the characteristics of the inflowing water relatively higher enrichment of major ion concentrations in the freshening event is observed compared to their depletion in the salinization event as mentioned in section 2 2 in column set m the freshening and salinization events are preceded by the flushing of columns with respective waters which reduces the influence of seawater before the freshening event and the effect of freshwater before the salinization event the reduction of seawater influence by the freshwater flushing is much lesser than the reduction of freshwater influence by the seawater flushing this is caused due to very high dissolved constituents in the seawater which leads to a higher increase in major ion concentrations during the freshening event furthermore the influence of seawater increases with the increase in the experiment time period which is clearly visible in column c similar to major ions the trace elements including br sr b and li also show enrichments in their concentrations during the freshening event and depletion during the salinization event in the pore waters of column set m with respect to column sets f and s fig 7 these trace elements from the injected seawater in column set m get absorbed by the column sediments leading to a decrease in their concentrations in the pore water during the salinization process on the other hand the absorption of elements from seawater is less in column set s due to continuous seawater injection similarly the release of elements from column sediments during the freshening process leads to more enrichment of trace element concentrations in the pore water of column set m as compared to column set f therefore there are more deviations in the trace element concentrations of pore water of column set m due to alternate freshwater seawater injections while continuous freshwater seawater injections do not cause a significant change in trace element concentrations of pore water in reference columns set f and s the enrichments depletions are found to be relatively higher for br and b and lower for li and sr this is in accordance with their higher and lower concentrations in the injected seawater respectively boron and li concentration exhibits very prominent deviation for freshening and salinization events suggesting their possible usage as strong seawater tracers fig 7 it is also observed that the enrichments in their concentrations during the freshening event are significantly higher as compared to their concentrations in pore waters of column set f while their depletions are negligible with respect to the concentrations of the pore water in the column set s thus higher deviations in trace element concentrations during the freshening event is a clear indication of stronger seawater influence despite freshwater flushing furthermore the increasing seawater influence over time is more clearly observed from these trace element concentrations than the major ions the elements ba and mn show a very limited deviation in their concentrations during both freshening and salinization events in column set m with respect to the reference columns fig 7 therefore it is clear that alternate freshening and salinization events have a significant impact on the major ion and trace element concentrations of the pore water further the data also suggest that once saltwater intrusion has happened coastal aquifers would require a much longer time period to attenuate its impact by the freshening process 4 3 sediment water interaction 4 3 1 ion exchange process the preceding discussion clearly demonstrates that significant changes in the pore water chemistry in column set m occur due to alternate freshwater and seawater injections the role of ion exchange process in such changes in the pore water chemistry were observed from the deviation in pore water chemistry from the conservative seawater freshwater mixing the deviations between the measured and expected concentrations of major ions were plotted against the freshening salinization cycles fig 8 a f the changes in ca and mg concentrations are either negative or close to zero for the freshening event and positive for the salinization event fig 8a b however the deviations in na and k concentrations are positive for the freshening event and negative or close to zero for the salinization event fig 8c d these changes in major ions indicate the role of ion exchange process between the inflowing water and sediments in controlling the pore water chemistry the direct ion exchange during the freshening event results in elevated na and k concentrations positive deviation with depleted ca and mg concentrations negative deviation in the pore water in comparison to the seawater freshwater mixing subsequently the reverse ion exchange process causes enrichment of ca and mg with the depletion of na and k in the pore water during the salinization event the chemical reaction between the sediment and water for the direct ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes are represented in eq 4 and eq 5 respectively similar behavior of major ions as a result of ion exchange processes has also been reported in the coastal aquifers of laos morocco saudi arabia and several other regions brindha et al 2017 najib et al 2017 zaidi et al 2015 the deviations in mg and k concentrations are distinct and divergent for the freshening and salinization events in the three columns fig 8b d however the deviations are not well marked for na and ca especially in column c due to the higher inflow of water and very high na concentrations in the inflowing seawater the periodic reversal of enrichment and depletion of major ion concentrations indicate that the ion exchange processes are reversible with the change in the freshening and salinization events further the changes in their concentrations are more for the salinization event than the freshening event which indicates a higher degree of reverse ion exchange process therefore the reversal of ion exchange processes may not equilibrate the major ion concentrations between the freshening and salinization events due to the differential rate of ion exchange processes studies have shown that the reverse ion exchange process is a rapid process as compared to the direct ion exchange amiri et al 2016b 4 2 x n a s c a 2 a q x 2 c a s 2 n a a q 5 x 2 c a s 2 n a a q 2 x n a s c a 2 a q where x sediment exchanger s solid state aq aqueous media alkalinity i e hco3 only as co3 was not detected does not show significant changes 0 6 to 1 8 between the measured and expected concentrations during both freshening and salinization events fig 8e it is slightly enriched during the salinization event while both enrichment and depletion are observed during the freshening event similarly so4 concentrations have shown slight enrichment or depletion during both freshening and salinization events fig 8f however the changes in alkalinity and so4 concentrations do not follow any specific pattern for both events as well as for different columns these changes between the measured and expected concentrations are not remarkably distinct for the freshening salinization events and could be due to mineral precipitation and dissolution in the columns sola et al 2013 a sharp variation in the deviation patterns for these major ions has been observed towards the end of the experiment these variations suggest that with the increase in the sediment water interaction time the slow processes also started controlling the pore water chemistry and caused very significant changes in the pore water composition however a more detailed study involving a longer sediment water interaction time period is required to pin point those processes the expected concentrations of trace elements b ba br li mn and sr were also calculated from the conservative seawater freshwater mixing to understand their chemical behavior towards the freshening and salinization events bromide and sr are considered as good indicators of seawater and can be helpful in identifying the freshening and salinization events telahigue et al 2020 furthermore br also behaves as a conservative ion since it does not take part in redox reactions adsorption and precipitation processes souid et al 2018 it has been observed that br is nearly conservative deviation 0 in all three columns during the freshening event fig 9 a however some deviations from the conservative mixing have been observed during the salinization event which is negligible with respect to its very high concentrations in the respective pore water 60 mg l similar conservative behaviour has been observed from the deviation pattern of sr during the freshening event the deviations in sr concentrations are found to be close to zero during the freshening event while varying slightly during the salinization event fig 9b studies have shown that sr shows a conservative behaviour during the freshening process or non conservative behaviour similar to ca during the salinization process russak and sivan 2010 however slight variations in sr concentration during the salinization event are negligible with respect to sr concentrations of the pore water 4 mg l therefore both br and sr can effectively be used as conservative ions in mass balance calculation to estimate the expected concentrations due to the seawater freshwater mixing however they have not been used for conservative seawater freshwater mixing in this study due to their lower concentrations in the pore water of the freshening event the elements such as b and li have similar chemical behavior towards the freshening and salinization events for both elements the changes between the measured and expected concentrations are positive for the freshening event and negative for the salinization event fig 9c d the enrichment of b and li during the freshening event and vice versa during the salinization event indicates that ion exchange processes control their concentrations in the pore water russak et al 2016 these changes in concentrations are more distinct than the major ion concentrations na k ca and mg thus suggesting that the concentrations of b and li can be used as more sensitive seawater tracers in coastal groundwater it is also observed that the enrichment of b during the freshening event is almost equal to its depletion during the salinization event i e the concentration of b is reversible with the change in freshening and salinization events fig 9c however li concentration is irreversible due to its higher depletion during the salinization event than its enrichment during the freshening event fig 9d further with the increase in the duration of the experimental cycle the deviations in b concentrations increase and move away from the equilibrium line fig 9c on the other hand the deviations in li concentrations move close to the equilibrium line with the increase in the number of salinization events fig 9d the seawater usually gets significantly diluted and its composition gradually changes with its inland migration thus the gradual changes in b and li concentrations can be used to understand and monitor the intrusion of saltwater in the interior of the coastal regions 4 3 2 precipitation dissolution process similar changes in ba and mn concentrations have been observed during the freshening and salinization events their concentrations are enriched positive deviation during both events possibly due to their release from the column sediments fig 9e f the release of ba and mn hints at the mineral dissolution process which is more under seawater interaction i e during the salinization event moore and joye 2021 further the deviations in ba and mn show a decreasing trend towards the equilibrium line in the later stages of freshening or salinization cycles of the column experiment indicating a decrease in mineral dissolution over time the enrichment of ba is significantly higher during the salinization event and shows a clear difference from the freshening event fig 9e f therefore higher ba concentrations in coastal groundwater can provide clear information on extreme seawater events in the coastal regions since the enrichment of mn is not distinct for both events this may not help in the identification of the seawater freshwater mixing in coastal regions fig 9f the calculated si values suggest that the pore waters of column set m are under saturated with respect to halite nacl anhydrite caso4 and gypsum caso4 2h2o these mineral phases are more under saturated in the freshening event than the salinization event annexure 5 during the freshening event lower major ion na ca cl and so4 concentrations in the inflowing water generate highly under saturated conditions and trigger higher dissolution of these mineral phases similarly during the salinization event extremely higher major ion concentrations in the intruding seawater develop near saturation conditions and do not contribute significantly to the mineral dissolution process the carbonate mineral phases like calcite caco3 dolomite caco3 mgco3 and aragonite caco3 vary from near saturation to over saturation annexure 5 these mineral phases mostly remain close to the saturation line during the freshening event and are over saturated during the salinization event however higher si values of dolomite as compared to calcite and aragonite will lead to preferential precipitation of dolomite sola et al 2013 this is further supported by higher concentrations of mg than ca in the pore water of the salinization event studies have shown that dolomite precipitates readily under high mg concentrations and high si values su et al 2019 it has also been reported that higher so4 concentrations can enhance the dolomite precipitation process han et al 2018 thus it can be inferred that precipitation dissolution of the sulfate and carbonate mineral phases gypsum anhydrite and dolomite is responsible for the deviations in so4 and hco3 concentrations from the conservative mixing further the saturation states of mineral phases show more variations in the three columns during the freshening event while the changes are limited during the salinization event it is therefore clear from the saturation states of mineral phases that the dissolution and precipitation processes also play an important role in the sediment water interaction during the freshening and salinization events the geochemical processes controlling the pore water chemistry in the column experiment have been compared with the geochemical processes inferred from the water samples collected from the field for this purpose sixty seasonal groundwater and nine surface water samples were collected along the coastal track of puri district odisha india these samples have shown that seawater freshwater mixing along with the ion exchange process controls the groundwater chemistry during both pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons prusty et al 2020 prusty and farooq 2020b the groundwater in the freshening stage indicates a significant role of the direct ion exchange process while the reverse ion exchange process controls the groundwater chemistry under the severe saltwater influence prusty et al 2020 moreover the surface waters flowing in the region are controlled by the simple binary mixing between freshwater and seawater without much intervention of the sediment water interaction prusty and farooq 2020b the validation of column experiment processes with the actual field conditions further adds value to the outcome of the column experiment 4 4 elemental changes in column sediments very high concentrations 15000 mg kg of al and fe have been observed in all three column sediments table 3 however the concentrations of these elements show a slight increase 1 2 in the post experiment sediments while they are depleted in the pore water with respect to the corresponding end members table 3 annexure 6 the enrichment of these elements in the sediments and depletion in the pore water indicates their removal from the pore water and subsequent adsorption precipitation on the sediments similarly the elements such as na ca and mg have shown an increase in their concentrations in the post experiment column sediments table 3 annexure 6 significantly high concentrations of na ca and mg in the seawater have led to their adsorption on sediments during the salinization event while they are released from the sediments during the freshening event this is further confirmed by the periodic enrichment and depletion in the concentration of these elements in the pore water with the change in freshening and salinization events the enrichment in their concentrations in the column sediments indicates that their retention is more than their release additionally si values calculated from the pore water during the salinization event show near saturation to over saturation for na ca and mg bearing minerals on the other hand k has shown reverse behavior i e depletion in the column sediments due to its relatively lower concentration in the seawater compared to other major ions table 3 annexure 6 higher desorption during the freshening event than adsorption during the salinization event resulted in the depletion of k concentration in the post experiment column sediments the concentrations of ba and mn are depleted in the post experiment sediments which are correlated to their enrichment in the pore water table 3 annexure 6 the changes in concentrations of the remaining elements are insignificant on account of their lower concentrations 100 mg kg in the sediments table 3 annexure 6 thus these changes are not prominently reflected in the pore water from the above discussion it is inferred that the elemental concentrations in the column sediments have been changed due to the injection of water into the columns and these changes are interrelated to the changes in the pore water chemistry however some of the elements show very less change due to their lower concentrations both in sediment and injecting waters 4 5 porosity and permeability porosity and permeability are important parameters that control the flow of water through the aquifer the changes in pore water chemistry and sediments have a direct impact on aquifer porosity and permeability yuan et al 2019 the porosity and permeability of column sediments measured at the beginning initial and completion final of the experiment are shown in fig 10 a b both the initial and final values of porosity and permeability show an increasing trend from column a to column b to column c which is in accordance with the grain size distribution in the column sediments further the column sediments show a substantial change between the initial and final values of porosity and permeability these changes are less in column a which subsequently increases in column b and column c porosity has increased in the columns with the freshwater flow and decreased in the columns with seawater flow and alternate freshwater seawater injections fig 10a this indicates that the decrease in porosity is resulted due to the interaction of seawater with the sediments however permeability is found to be decreased in all columns at the end of the experiment fig 10b the varying degree of changes in porosity and permeability in the columns could be due to the mineralogical changes that are reflected in the form of grain size distribution and also in element concentrations in the sediments and pore water the negative changes in porosity and permeability associated with the seawater indicate that it may bring severe changes in the coastal aquifer characteristics over time and require higher attention 5 conclusions coastal aquifers face frequent and periodic fluctuations in the seawater freshwater interface this alternatingly exposes the near interface aquifer sediments to freshwater and seawater drastically different chemistry of these waters forces sediments to equilibrate and re equilibrate with the prevailing water chemistry during each cycle the present study investigates the effect of these frequent sediment water interactions on pore water chemistry and properties i e porosity and permeability of the coastal aquifer to simulate the natural conditions in the laboratory sediment filled columns were periodically exposed to freshwater and seawater over a year it has been observed that periodic freshening and salinization cause significant changes in the pore water chemistry the effect of a single salinization event may require several freshwater flushing to bring back the pore water chemistry to its initial composition the alternate exposure of sediments to freshwater seawater triggers processes such as ion exchange mineral precipitation dissolution and elemental adsorption desorption that controls the pore water chemistry the major ions na k ca and mg along with some trace elements b and li in the pore water are found to be associated with the ion exchange process while the mineral precipitation dissolution process controls hco3 so4 ba and mn concentrations the study further highlights that the ion exchange processes are reversible in addition to the traditional major ions trace elements including b ba li mn and sr have been identified as highly sensitive markers for an effective detection of extreme saltwater intrusions in the inland areas the changes in pore water chemistry also bring changes in aquifer properties such as grain size distribution and elemental concentrations further it has been observed that the changes in grain size distribution significantly affected the porosity and permeability of the sediments therefore frequent changes in freshening and salinization in the long run not only will lead to severe changes in the coastal groundwater quality but also in its storativity and transmissivity this may aggravate the freshwater scarcity in the coastal regions the findings of the present study have a global applicability as the columns with different sediment compositions can represent a wide variety of coastal aquifers the changes in porosity and permeability in the aquifer sediments may provide the scientists an opportunity to model its long term effect on subsurface storage and movement of groundwater seawater and policy holders to manage the coastal

3926,artificial water diversion project has been increasingly implemented to control eutrophication and alleviate water shortage of lakes water diversion can affect the biogeochemical cycles however carbon dioxide co2 sensitivity in lakes to water diversion was poorly understood this study addressed the issue based on the famous water diversion project from the yangtze river to eutrophic lake taihu which has been carried out regularly since 2002 in china the partial pressure of co2 pco2 at two regions of the eutrophic lake water receiving gonghu bay and non water receiving central zone was investigated over 16 years 2002 2017 field measurement with high sampling frequency results showed the river to lake water diversion decreased phytoplankton biomass increased nutrient loadings and significantly elevated the pco2 and associated co2 emission meanwhile the water diversion project accounted for the notable co2 spatial heterogeneity between regions and within region however weak co2 seasonal variability was observed at gonghu bay during water diversion period the estimated co2 emission flux increased averagely by 54 due to water diversion primarily resulting from phytoplankton dilution nutrient enrichment and external co2 input water diversion and ammonia nitrogen together explained 69 of interannual variability pco2 at gonghu bay implying water diversion should be considered to better understanding the contribution of lake co2 emissions to c budget under a changing environment these findings were expected to serve as a reference to evaluate the water diversion effects further study should focus on the sources of the excess co2 to make the project a co2 neutral option keywords river to lake water diversion carbon dioxide spatial heterogeneity seasonal variability co2 flux 1 introduction inland waters lakes reservoirs rivers and shallow ponds can emit a substantial portion of co2 to the atmosphere and are being recognized as important co2 sources raymond et al 2013 borges et al 2015 holgerson and raymond 2016 previous studies have estimated that global co2 emissions from inland waters are nearly equivalent to land ecosystem carbon sink tranvik et al 2009 borges et al 2015 generally inland lakes are supersaturated with co2 and thus play an essential role in global or regional co2 budget estimation tranvik et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 li et al 2018a however obtaining an accurate estimate of the lake co2 budget is challenging due to the multiple physical chemical and biological mechanisms weyhenmeyer et al 2015 bogard and del giorgio 2016 yang et al 2020 more studies should be conducted to understand the drivers of co2 variability in lakes and predicting emissions biogeochemical processes influencing lake co2 variability are generally associated with internal metabolic activities and external loading inputs lake internal metabolic activities can either decrease co2 emissions via photosynthesis or increase emissions via respiration bogard and del giorgio 2016 xiao et al 2020b external loading inputs are being increasingly recognized as a critical factor driving co2 variability a large portion of co2 emissions from lakes caused by hydrologic carbon inputs has been reported worldwide maberly et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2016 some studies have even found that hydrological process determined co2 variability of lakes mcdonald et al 2013 chmiel et al 2016 however the role of hydrological control in the aquatic co2 budget varied greatly due to different hydrological situations gomez gener et al 2016 wallin et al 2020 inland lakes are suffering eutrophic issues and associated water resources shortage due to nutrient enrichment and climate change qin et al 2010 paerl and paul 2012 artificial water diversion measures from rivers to lakes can decrease water residence time flush pollutants reduces algal biomass aggregation and supply water resources which have received growing attention to cope with the issue yu et al 2018 barbosa et al 2021 tang et al 2021 for instance water diversion measures have been successfully conducted with moses lake in america welch et al 1992 lake veluwe in the netherlands jagtman et al 1992 lake barato in japan shinohara et al 2008 lake taihu and lake dianchi in china liu et al 2014 dai et al 2020 meanwhile co2 dynamic variability from eutrophic lakes has been received considerable interest due to high primary production and massive nutrient enrichment bartosiewicz et al 2021 morales williams et al 2020 xiao et al 2020b however the artificial hydrologic process effect on the eutrophic lake co2 variability remains under investigated lake taihu with a surface area of 2338 km2 is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river featured by marine monsoon subtropical climate lake taihu is significant for local flood control shipping water supply and tourism the lake is also an important drinking water supply for surrounding large cities e g shanghai suzhou and wuxi eutrophication and algal blooms have occurred frequently in the lake due to rapid population and economic growth duan et al 2009 qin et al 2010 xiao et al 2019 to improve the water quality cope with algal blooms and meet the watershed water demands water diversion from the yangtze river to the lake has been initiated by taihu basin authority since 2002 some studies found that the water diversion project could influence nutrient loading and phytoplankton habitat in the water receiving region of the lake hu et al 2008 qin et al 2010 dai et al 2020 it is worth noting that nutrient and phytoplankton are two essential factors influencing lake co2 variability especially in eutrophic lakes pacheco et al 2014 davidson et al 2015 xiao et al 2020b these motivate the evaluation of the effects of the manual hydrologic process river to lake water diversion on co2 variability this study considers the project water diversion from yangtze river to eutrophic lake taihu wdyt as an example to investigate the manual hydrologic process effects on lake co2 based on long term sampling from 2002 the start year of the wdyt project to 2017 with high time resolution the pco2 in the water receiving and non water receiving regions of the lake was compared during water diversion and non diversion periods the objectives of the study were 1 to elucidate the role of water diversion in shaping lake co2 and 2 to evaluate the water diversion effect on lake co2 budget estimation considering water diversion has become a popular and quick measure to control eutrophication and alleviate water resources shortage in lakes the present study may provide an opportunity to generalize its effects on co2 and to predict lake co2 responses to different hydrologic processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and sampling locations field samplings were conducted in lake taihu in eastern china from 2002 to 2017 gonghu bay with surface area of approximate 216 km2 and mean water depth of 1 8 m is located in the northeastern part of the lake xiao et al 2017 dai et al 2020 gonghu bay connects with wangyu river the channel for water diversion from yangtze river to lake taihu fig 1 since 2002 the taihu basin authority has regulated the inputs of the yangtze river water into gonghu bay as the first station that water transfers into lake taihu gonghu bay is considered as a water receiving region of the lake meanwhile a previous study showed that gonghu bay was one of the confined regions affected by water diversion from the yangtze river hu et al 2008 the central zone of the lake with open water is adjacent to gonghu bay fig 1 the zone is less affected by the water diversion project in summary gonghu bay the water receiving region is a fine place to elucidate the roles of water diversion on co2 variability the central zone is considered as a non water receiving region reference region to discuss the potential contribution of the water diversion project on co2 budget estimation there were two sampling locations site 13 and site 14 in gonghu bay one inside in gonghu bay site 13 and another near the estuary of wangyu river site 14 fig 1 water at the two locations were sampled seasonally in february may august and november from 2002 to 2004 since 2005 monthly sampling was conducted at the two locations due to algal blooms occurring there were also two sampling locations site 7 and site 8 in the central zone fig 1 and water samples at the two locations were collected monthly from 2002 to 2017 meanwhile there is a sampling location site 31 in the transitional zone between gonghu bay and the central zone and water samples were collected seasonally notably the study was supported by the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research tller a long term observation station of the chinese ecosystem research network cern the samplings for physical chemical and biological parameters measurements at the five locations site 7 site 8 site 13 site 14 and site 31 were performed regularly by tller zhang et al 2018 xiao et al 2020b 2 2 lake co2 data the lake pco2 was obtained from the measurements of in situ water temperature tw alkalinity alk and ph the tw and ph were measured via a multi parameter probe with high resolution 0 001 c for tw and 0 01 unit for ph in the field alk was measured via titration on the sampling date it should be noted that the probe for ph measurement was calibrated carefully before sampling the details about the pco2 acquisition has been presented in our previous study xiao et al 2020b and other studies raymond et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 meanwhile the co2 exchange flux f c between lake atmosphere interface was calculated via the diffusion model cole and caraco 1998 1 f c k h k p c o 2 p a where kh is the co2 henry s constant adjusted for water temperature p a is the local atmospheric co2 partial pressure above the water surface and was given by a co2 gas analyzer with a precision of 0 05 μatm xiao et al 2014 k is the co2 gas exchange velocity between the lake atmosphere interface this study calculated the k from the wind speed dependent model described by cole and caraco 1998 positive value of f c indicates the co2 release from the lake to the atmosphere for the k value estimation the long term 2002 2017 wind speed was obtained from the china meteorological observation network s ds dongshan station although the meteorological station ds is located at the top of mountain dongshan in the eastern part of lake taihu fig 1 the measured wind speed at the station was significantly lower than that at the lake due to the local windshield effect wang et al 2014 wind speed at pts pingtaishan a meteorological station in the center of lake taihu fig 1 was measured hourly since 2013 lee et al 2014 and the wind speed at the two stations was highly correlated xiao et al 2020b therefore long term wind speed data at ds adjusted according to the synchronous wind speed measured at pts 2 3 environmental variables environmental variables including nutrients chlorophyll a chl a dissolved oxygen do and dissolved organic carbon doc together with water diversion scenarios e g water diversion quantity water diversion flowrate and transferred duration were considered from 2002 to 2017 the sampling and measurements of these variables have been previously reported xu et al 2017 xiao et al 2020b in brief do was measured in situ with a multi parameter probe and water samples for environmental parameter measurement were stored in coolers in the field analyses for nutrients chl a and doc were conducted in the laboratory after sampling nutrients total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and total phosphorus tp were determined with a spectrophotometer doc was detected with a toc analyzer and chl a was extracted with 90 hot ethanol and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically 2 4 project of wdyt pollution induced water resources shortage in the lake taihu basin was severe wdyt was carried out to solve the problem freshwater was transferred from the yangtze river into the lake via the wangyu river the taihu basin authority regulated the water diversion project and water from the yangtze river was generally diverted into lake taihu when a low real time water level occurred as a famous project in china the water diversion impact on the water environment of water receiving region gonghu bay has attracted considerable attention monthly data about the water diversion project were obtained from the annual reports of wdyt project at taihu basin authority http www tba gov cn slbthlyglj sj sj html the water diversion period annual input amount of water from the yangtze river to lake taihu and the transferred duration from 2002 to 2017 were presented in supporting information table s1 and fig s1 2 5 statistic analysis the sampling period in the three study regions gonghu bay the central zone and the transitional zone was divided into water diversion and non diversion the differences in co2 level and environmental variables at the three study regions were compared between water diversion and non diversion periods meanwhile the differences in co2 and the variables were also compared between the two regions during the non water diversion period monthly mean data were used for temporal analysis and the monthly mean co2 and variables for each field sampling were calculated using all data within the corresponding regions from 2002 to 2017 then monthly mean data were calculated as mean values for spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february next year and the least significant difference lsd test was carried out to determine differences between seasons simple regression and multi linear regression were carried out to investigate the correlations between the environmental variables and co2 in multi linear regression the variance inflation factor vif was used to determine if multicollinearity was significant when vif was greater than the threshold of 5 any of the variables in the regression equation were eliminated to reduce multicollinearity 3 results 3 1 annual water diversion and its impact on environment the annual water diversion quantity and transferred duration varied greatly from 2002 to 2017 fig s1 the annual water diversion quantity and transferred duration ranged from 1 44 108 m3 to 16 10 108 m3 and 22 days to 209 days from 2002 to 2017 about total 13 billion m3 water have been diverted into the lake it is roughly estimated that annual water diversion quantity from the yangtze river accounted for 9 of the total inflowing water it is worth noting that the annual water diversion was negatively correlated with precipitation and chl a an index of algal biomass fig s2 suggesting the positive effect of the water diversion project on water supply and eutrophication control some environmental variables varied significantly between regions and across time due to the water diversion project table 1 gonghu bay had a significantly p 0 01 higher chl a concentration 18 62 μg l 1 than the central zone 13 40 μg l 1 during the non water diversion period but insignificant p 0 64 difference between the two regions occurred during the water diversion period in contrast significantly p 0 05 higher nh 4 n concentration and lower doc concentration occurred in gonghu bay with water diversion but there were insignificant p 0 05 differences without water diversion within gonghu bay nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations with water diversion were significantly p 0 05 higher than that without water diversion but significantly p 0 05 lower chl a and doc concentration occurred with water diversion for comparison the nh 4 n no 3 n chl a and doc showed insignificant p 0 05 differences between the two periods within the central zone water temperature and do showed negligible p 0 05 differences between time and across regions in summary the water diversion project decreased chl a and doc concentrations but increased nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations in gonghu bay 3 2 annual pco2 variations and its response to water diversion long term sampling showed substantial interannual variability in pco2 fig 2 a from 2002 to 2017 the annual mean pco2 ranged from 374 μatm to 973 μatm in gonghu bay from 433 μatm to 1007 μatm in the central zone and from 353 μatm to 875 μatm in the transitional zone the annual pco2 in gonghu bay was positively correlated with the water diversion flowrate the variability in water diversion flowrate could explain 57 of the observed variation in pco2 fig 2b r 2 0 57 p 0 01 n 16 however the pco2 showed a poor correlation with water diversion flowrate in other regions central zone p 0 08 n 16 transitional zone p 0 10 n 13 fig 2c d 3 3 p co2 comparison between water diversion and non diversion periods the water diversion project influenced the spatial temporal patterns in pco2 the monthly pco2 between gonghu bay and the central zone was highly correlated during the non diversion period while the correlation was relatively weak during the water diversion period fig 3 the monthly pco2 comparison between the two sampling locations within gonghu bay also showed the same results water diversion r 2 0 27 p 0 01 n 46 non water diversion r 2 0 65 p 0 01 n 110 fig s3a however the monthly pco2 between the two sampling locations within central zone was highly correlated during water diversion and non diversion periods fig s3b seasonally pco2 at gonghu bay was relatively uniform during the water diversion period fig 4 a with insignificant p 0 05 differences among seasons in contrast significantly p 0 05 lower pco2 occurred in summer and autumn during non water diversion period fig 4b for comparison the pco2 both showed seasonality at the central zone during water diversion and non diversion periods with significantly lower values occurring in summer and autumn fig 4 importantly the pco2 at gonghu bay was significantly higher p 0 05 in summer and autumn compared to that at central zone during the water diversion period but insignificant p 0 05 differences between the regions occurred in each season during the non water diversion period overall the pco2 at gonghu bay with mean value of 811 296 μatm was significantly p 0 05 higher than that at the central zone 677 310 μatm and the transitional zone 663 175 μatm during the water diversion period fig s4 however the pco2 showed insignificant p 0 05 differences gonghu bay 636 301 μatm central zone 672 310 μatm transitional zone 635 289 μatm among the study region during the non diversion period 3 4 factors influencing pco2 variability the pco2 exhibited different responses to environmental variables during water diversion and non diversion periods especially at gonghu bay long term measurement 2002 2017 showed that monthly pco2 was not associated with chl a at gonghu bay during the water diversion period but significant negative correlation during the non diversion period was found fig 5 a for comparison the pco2 was both negatively correlated with chl a during the water diversion and non diversion periods at the central zone statistic analysis showed the variability in pco2 at gonghu bay was positively correlated with nh 4 n and no 3 n during the water diversion period during the non diversion period the pco2 was positively related with nh 4 n no 3 n tn and doc but negatively correlated with water temperature during non diversion period at the central zone the pco2 was negatively correlated with water temperature and positively correlated with no 3 n and tn both during the water diversion and non diversion periods table s2 multilinear stepwise regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors influencing the annual trend in pco2 results revealed that nh 4 n mg l 1 and water diversion flowrate q 104 m3 d 1 from the yangtze river to the lake could best explain the variability in pco2 μatm from 2002 to 2017 at gonghu bay the multilinear regression function was 2 pc o 2 634 71 n h 4 n 0 39 q 198 73 the function could explain 69 of the large interannual variability in the pco2 at gonghu bay r 2 0 69 p 0 05 meanwhile results also showed that nh 4 n mg l 1 and no 3 n mg l 1 explained 64 of interannual variability in the pco2 at the central zone r 2 0 64 p 0 05 3 pc o 2 382 40 nh 4 n 321 46 no 3 n 281 20 the vif between nh 4 n and q in equation 2 and between nh 4 n and no 3 n in equation 3 were 1 71 and 1 15 respectively the vif values were lower than the threshold of 5 implying that multicollinearity was negligible 3 5 co2 flux estimation during diversion and non diversion periods the co2 exchange flux between the lake atmosphere was estimated according to the pco2 measurement via equation 1 it is estimated that the co2 flux at gonghu bay central zone and transitional zone were 12 91 mmol m 2 d 1 12 65 mmol m 2 d 1 and 12 18 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively with insignificant p 0 05 differences across the region however the co2 flux at gonghu bay 17 28 mmol m 2 d 1 with water diversion was significantly higher than that at the other two regions fig s4 the estimated co2 flux with the water diversion was 54 higher than that without diversion at gonghu bay in contrast the co2 flux at central zone and transitional zone showed insignificant differences between the two periods fig s4 spatially the pco2 and co2 flux as functions of distance from wangyu river during the water diversion period the values decreased significantly with distance increase fig 6 a for comparison minor spatial variability of pco2 and co2 flux were found during non water diversion fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 causes of large pco2 during river to lake water diversion the long term 2002 2017 field sampling showed that river to lake water diversion increased the pco2 figs 4 and s4 specifically significantly p 0 05 higher pco2 occurred during the water diversion period at the water receiving region leading to the notable spatial heterogeneity in pco2 between water receiving and non water receiving regions 811 μatm versus 677 μatm for comparison the pco2 at the two regions were 636 μatm and 672 μatm during the non diversion period respectively the increase in pco2 during the water diversion period may arise from less co2 uptake by algal biomass more co2 production due to nutrient enrichment and direct co2 input by river discharge algal blooms increase primary production which is likely to lead decrease in pco2 of eutrophic lakes pacheco et al 2014 grasset et al 2020 instead a significant negative correlation between the pco2 and chl a an index of algal abundance was found in this study fig 5 however it is worth noting that the chl a concentration was significantly p 0 05 lower and not correlated with pco2 at gonghu bay during the water diversion period table 1 and fig 5a one of the main aims of wdyt project is to control the eutrophication and reduce the chl a concentration qin et al 2010 our data also showed low chl a concentration occurred with water diversion at gonghu bay table 1 and fig s2 thus water diversion induced low chl a may contribute to the high pco2 at gonghu bay via reducing co2 uptake junger et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that lake pco2 increased with nutrient enrichment kortelainen et al 2006 natchimuthu et al 2017 the lake pco2 was positively correlated with nutrient tn nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations table s2 this was consistent with previous studies suggesting nutrients could increase the pco2 via stimulating respiration wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2020a meanwhile our long term sampling found water diversion increased the nutrient concentration e g nh 4 n and no 3 n at water receiving gonghu bay table 1 likely caused by high nutrient loading in the inflow to the wangyu river dai et al 2020 the external nutrient loading input may stimulate co2 production and increase pco2 kortelainen et al 2006 wang et al 2017 additionally nh 4 n and water diversion flowrate together explained 69 of the interannual variability in the pco2 at gonghu bay r 2 0 69 p 0 05 equation 2 from 2002 to 2017 which also suggested the role of the external nutrient loading in determining co2 variability external co2 input from watershed can also increase lake pco2 previous studies have found that external co2 input can directly increase pco2 in lakes weyhenmeyer et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2016 the pco2 at gonghu bay was significantly higher than that at central zone and transitional zone during the water sampling period but the differences between them was insignificant during the non diversion period fig s4a spatially the pco2 decreased significantly with distance from wangyu river during the water diversion period but no variability was found during non water diversion fig s3 and 6 field sampling found pco2 in wangyu river was significantly higher than that in sampling location at gonghu bay and the pco2 in sampling locations of the river and lake was positively correlated fig s5 thus external co2 input via the diversion channel wangyu river may influence the lake pco2 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 xiao et al 2020b 4 2 change in seasonal pco2 and the role of water diversion previous studies have found strong co2 seasonal variability especially in eutrophic lakes klaus et al 2019 morales williams et al 2020 xiao et al 2020b the pco2 in gonghu bay varied seasonally during the non diversion period with significantly p 0 05 values in summer and autumn which was consistent with pco2 seasonal variation at the central zone fig 4b and other studies trolle et al 2012 qi et al 2020 however the pco2 was relatively homogenous across seasons at gonghu bay during the water diversion period fig 4a additionally another difference from other lakes kortelainen et al 2006 kosten et al 2010 finlay et al 2015 was the pco2 temporal variability in gonghu bay with water diversion was unrelated to water temperature table s2 both of these suggested that water diversion influenced the seasonal variability in pco2 river to lake water diversion increased the pco2 at gonghu bay however the water diversion effects varied seasonally fig 4 the pco2 in gonghu bay was significantly p 0 05 higher than that at central zone in summer and autumn still the differences between gonghu bay and central zone were insignificant p 0 05 in spring and winter peak chl a appeared in summer and autumn at the central zone due to warm water temperature xu et al 2017 leading to large co2 uptake and decreases in pco2 pacheco et al 2014 grasset et al 2020 in contrast higher pco2 at gonghu bay would be retained due to the reduction in chl a caused by water diversion junger et al 2019 meanwhile a substantial pco2 from rivers of the taihu basin was observed in summer and autumn due to high water temperature yu et al 2017 xiao et al 2021 the external input from rivers with high co2 was likely to increase the lake pco2 at that time mcdonald et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 thus the change in seasonal co2 patterns may be associated with water diversion via decreasing internal consumption and increasing external input 4 3 implication for co2 budget estimation spatial variability in co2 flux within lake has received great concerns to accurately estimate the co2 budget natchimuthu et al 2017 denfeld et al 2020 qi et al 2020 the co2 flux showed weak spatial variability without water diversion based on cross region comparisons however significantly higher co2 flux from water receiving gonghu bay occurred during the water diversion period fig s4 suggesting water diversion was likely to influence the lake co2 flux spatial dynamics mcdonald et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 some studies have shown precipitation driven water diversion could either increase co2 emission due to external co2 input via runoff or decrease emission due to dilution li et al 2018b junger et al 2019 wallin et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 our results suggested the hydrologic regimes river to lake water diversion significantly increased co2 emission primarily due to reducing co2 uptake via phytoplankton dilution junger et al 2019 stimulating co2 production via nutrient enrichment kortelainen et al 2006 and increasing co2 input from watershed weyhenmeyer et al 2015 therefore the water diversion effects should be considered to better understanding co2 cycle and to avoid the underestimation of co2 flux in lakes identifying the drivers of long term multi decades co2 trends from lakes is vital to predicting future co2 emissions finlay et al 2015 seekell and gudasz 2016 our results indicated that the water diversion project accounted for the large interannual variability of pco2 at water receiving gonghu bay fig 2 water diversion flowrate and nh 4 n together explained 69 of the variability from 2002 to 2017 meanwhile the nh 4 n concentration was also influenced by the water diversion project in the lake dai et al 2020 which in turn emphasized the significance of water diversion previous studies have demonstrated that hydrologic processes sustained lake co2 emissions weyhenmeyer et al 2015 bogard and del giorgio 2016 gomez gener et al 2016 based on the water diversion data and the co2 sampling figs 2 and s2 we estimated that the hydrologic regimes increased the co2 emission flux by 54 our results suggested the lake co2 responded significantly to the water diversion project which should be considered to improve understanding of the contribution of lake co2 emissions to the global c budget the river to lake water diversion influences warming and eutrophication effects on the lake co2 variability lake water temperature and eutrophication have increased due to climate and environmental change paerl and paul 2012 woolway et al 2020 which have been projected to seriously affect lake co2 budget estimation based on the correlation between water temperature chl a and co2 finlay et al 2015 kortelainen et al 2006 kosten et al 2010 morales williams et al 2020 however our results showed the lake co2 was unrelated to water temperature with water diversion table 1 which was similar to previous studies showing that non thermal factors may confound the temperature influence on co2 davidson et al 2015 meanwhile water diversion could dilute phytoplankton and increase external loadings input leading to the absence of eutrophication effects junger et al 2019 clearly the role of hydrological processes of river to lake water diversion should be considered in evaluating the effects of warming and eutrophication of lake co2 cycling 4 4 study limitations and future outlook like most studies there are limitations in the current study overall the effects of water diversion on co2 were evaluated at seasonal annual and spatial scales it is worth noting that diel variations in lake co2 were significant due to the different metabolism patterns day and night yang et al 2019 however the water diversion effects on diurnal co2 remained unclear due to the difficulty of field sampling considering nutrient and chl a were associated with lake co2 variability kortelainen et al 2006 xiao et al 2020b and water diversion can influence the two variables dai et al 2020 tang et al 2021 it is reasonable to propose that water diversion may play a role in regulating daily change in co2 our study suggested water diversion increased pco2 and associated co2 emission flux still the relative importance of different sources and processes e g in situ production consumption and external input to the excess co2 in the lake was unclear posing a challenge to make the river to lake water diversion project a co2 neutral option additionally a previous study has shown that doc degradation produced more co2 and can increase pco2 in lakes lapierre et al 2013 interestingly our long term data found water diversion increased pco2 but decrease doc during the water diversion period table 1 suggesting the uncoupling of trends in co2 and doc nydahl et al 2017 although a substantial portion of doc could be derived from phytoplankton blooms and low doc may result from phytoplankton dilute junger et al 2019 xiao et al 2020a it is likely that external input was crucial in fueling co2 emission from lakes with low doc maberly et al 2013 further study is needed to explain the uncoupling of long term trends in co2 and doc and better understand the sources sustaining the emission from lakes 5 conclusions long term 2002 2017 field measurements with high sampling frequency suggested the river to lake water diversion project increased the pco2 and associated co2 emission flux at water receiving gonghu bay meanwhile the water diversion project decreased chl a concentration but increased nutrient loadings on average the co2 emission flux increased by 54 with the water diversion project the water diversion project increased the lake co2 level mainly through three potential mechanisms 1 reducing co2 uptake via phytoplankton dilution 2 increasing co2 production via nutrient enrichment and 3 significant co2 input from the catchment the role of water diversion accounted for the co2 variability in space considerable spatial heterogeneity across regions and within region was found during the water diversion period however weak seasonal variability was observed at water receiving gonghu bay the water diversion project and nh 4 n explained 69 of large interannual variability pco2 at gonghu bay over 16 years 2002 2017 meanwhile the co2 was unrelated to water temperature and eutrophication with water diversion these implied that the role of river to lake water diversion should be considered in evaluating the effects of warming and eutrophication of the lake co2 budget estimation and improving understanding of the contribution of lake co2 emissions to the

3926,artificial water diversion project has been increasingly implemented to control eutrophication and alleviate water shortage of lakes water diversion can affect the biogeochemical cycles however carbon dioxide co2 sensitivity in lakes to water diversion was poorly understood this study addressed the issue based on the famous water diversion project from the yangtze river to eutrophic lake taihu which has been carried out regularly since 2002 in china the partial pressure of co2 pco2 at two regions of the eutrophic lake water receiving gonghu bay and non water receiving central zone was investigated over 16 years 2002 2017 field measurement with high sampling frequency results showed the river to lake water diversion decreased phytoplankton biomass increased nutrient loadings and significantly elevated the pco2 and associated co2 emission meanwhile the water diversion project accounted for the notable co2 spatial heterogeneity between regions and within region however weak co2 seasonal variability was observed at gonghu bay during water diversion period the estimated co2 emission flux increased averagely by 54 due to water diversion primarily resulting from phytoplankton dilution nutrient enrichment and external co2 input water diversion and ammonia nitrogen together explained 69 of interannual variability pco2 at gonghu bay implying water diversion should be considered to better understanding the contribution of lake co2 emissions to c budget under a changing environment these findings were expected to serve as a reference to evaluate the water diversion effects further study should focus on the sources of the excess co2 to make the project a co2 neutral option keywords river to lake water diversion carbon dioxide spatial heterogeneity seasonal variability co2 flux 1 introduction inland waters lakes reservoirs rivers and shallow ponds can emit a substantial portion of co2 to the atmosphere and are being recognized as important co2 sources raymond et al 2013 borges et al 2015 holgerson and raymond 2016 previous studies have estimated that global co2 emissions from inland waters are nearly equivalent to land ecosystem carbon sink tranvik et al 2009 borges et al 2015 generally inland lakes are supersaturated with co2 and thus play an essential role in global or regional co2 budget estimation tranvik et al 2009 raymond et al 2013 li et al 2018a however obtaining an accurate estimate of the lake co2 budget is challenging due to the multiple physical chemical and biological mechanisms weyhenmeyer et al 2015 bogard and del giorgio 2016 yang et al 2020 more studies should be conducted to understand the drivers of co2 variability in lakes and predicting emissions biogeochemical processes influencing lake co2 variability are generally associated with internal metabolic activities and external loading inputs lake internal metabolic activities can either decrease co2 emissions via photosynthesis or increase emissions via respiration bogard and del giorgio 2016 xiao et al 2020b external loading inputs are being increasingly recognized as a critical factor driving co2 variability a large portion of co2 emissions from lakes caused by hydrologic carbon inputs has been reported worldwide maberly et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2016 some studies have even found that hydrological process determined co2 variability of lakes mcdonald et al 2013 chmiel et al 2016 however the role of hydrological control in the aquatic co2 budget varied greatly due to different hydrological situations gomez gener et al 2016 wallin et al 2020 inland lakes are suffering eutrophic issues and associated water resources shortage due to nutrient enrichment and climate change qin et al 2010 paerl and paul 2012 artificial water diversion measures from rivers to lakes can decrease water residence time flush pollutants reduces algal biomass aggregation and supply water resources which have received growing attention to cope with the issue yu et al 2018 barbosa et al 2021 tang et al 2021 for instance water diversion measures have been successfully conducted with moses lake in america welch et al 1992 lake veluwe in the netherlands jagtman et al 1992 lake barato in japan shinohara et al 2008 lake taihu and lake dianchi in china liu et al 2014 dai et al 2020 meanwhile co2 dynamic variability from eutrophic lakes has been received considerable interest due to high primary production and massive nutrient enrichment bartosiewicz et al 2021 morales williams et al 2020 xiao et al 2020b however the artificial hydrologic process effect on the eutrophic lake co2 variability remains under investigated lake taihu with a surface area of 2338 km2 is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river featured by marine monsoon subtropical climate lake taihu is significant for local flood control shipping water supply and tourism the lake is also an important drinking water supply for surrounding large cities e g shanghai suzhou and wuxi eutrophication and algal blooms have occurred frequently in the lake due to rapid population and economic growth duan et al 2009 qin et al 2010 xiao et al 2019 to improve the water quality cope with algal blooms and meet the watershed water demands water diversion from the yangtze river to the lake has been initiated by taihu basin authority since 2002 some studies found that the water diversion project could influence nutrient loading and phytoplankton habitat in the water receiving region of the lake hu et al 2008 qin et al 2010 dai et al 2020 it is worth noting that nutrient and phytoplankton are two essential factors influencing lake co2 variability especially in eutrophic lakes pacheco et al 2014 davidson et al 2015 xiao et al 2020b these motivate the evaluation of the effects of the manual hydrologic process river to lake water diversion on co2 variability this study considers the project water diversion from yangtze river to eutrophic lake taihu wdyt as an example to investigate the manual hydrologic process effects on lake co2 based on long term sampling from 2002 the start year of the wdyt project to 2017 with high time resolution the pco2 in the water receiving and non water receiving regions of the lake was compared during water diversion and non diversion periods the objectives of the study were 1 to elucidate the role of water diversion in shaping lake co2 and 2 to evaluate the water diversion effect on lake co2 budget estimation considering water diversion has become a popular and quick measure to control eutrophication and alleviate water resources shortage in lakes the present study may provide an opportunity to generalize its effects on co2 and to predict lake co2 responses to different hydrologic processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region and sampling locations field samplings were conducted in lake taihu in eastern china from 2002 to 2017 gonghu bay with surface area of approximate 216 km2 and mean water depth of 1 8 m is located in the northeastern part of the lake xiao et al 2017 dai et al 2020 gonghu bay connects with wangyu river the channel for water diversion from yangtze river to lake taihu fig 1 since 2002 the taihu basin authority has regulated the inputs of the yangtze river water into gonghu bay as the first station that water transfers into lake taihu gonghu bay is considered as a water receiving region of the lake meanwhile a previous study showed that gonghu bay was one of the confined regions affected by water diversion from the yangtze river hu et al 2008 the central zone of the lake with open water is adjacent to gonghu bay fig 1 the zone is less affected by the water diversion project in summary gonghu bay the water receiving region is a fine place to elucidate the roles of water diversion on co2 variability the central zone is considered as a non water receiving region reference region to discuss the potential contribution of the water diversion project on co2 budget estimation there were two sampling locations site 13 and site 14 in gonghu bay one inside in gonghu bay site 13 and another near the estuary of wangyu river site 14 fig 1 water at the two locations were sampled seasonally in february may august and november from 2002 to 2004 since 2005 monthly sampling was conducted at the two locations due to algal blooms occurring there were also two sampling locations site 7 and site 8 in the central zone fig 1 and water samples at the two locations were collected monthly from 2002 to 2017 meanwhile there is a sampling location site 31 in the transitional zone between gonghu bay and the central zone and water samples were collected seasonally notably the study was supported by the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research tller a long term observation station of the chinese ecosystem research network cern the samplings for physical chemical and biological parameters measurements at the five locations site 7 site 8 site 13 site 14 and site 31 were performed regularly by tller zhang et al 2018 xiao et al 2020b 2 2 lake co2 data the lake pco2 was obtained from the measurements of in situ water temperature tw alkalinity alk and ph the tw and ph were measured via a multi parameter probe with high resolution 0 001 c for tw and 0 01 unit for ph in the field alk was measured via titration on the sampling date it should be noted that the probe for ph measurement was calibrated carefully before sampling the details about the pco2 acquisition has been presented in our previous study xiao et al 2020b and other studies raymond et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 meanwhile the co2 exchange flux f c between lake atmosphere interface was calculated via the diffusion model cole and caraco 1998 1 f c k h k p c o 2 p a where kh is the co2 henry s constant adjusted for water temperature p a is the local atmospheric co2 partial pressure above the water surface and was given by a co2 gas analyzer with a precision of 0 05 μatm xiao et al 2014 k is the co2 gas exchange velocity between the lake atmosphere interface this study calculated the k from the wind speed dependent model described by cole and caraco 1998 positive value of f c indicates the co2 release from the lake to the atmosphere for the k value estimation the long term 2002 2017 wind speed was obtained from the china meteorological observation network s ds dongshan station although the meteorological station ds is located at the top of mountain dongshan in the eastern part of lake taihu fig 1 the measured wind speed at the station was significantly lower than that at the lake due to the local windshield effect wang et al 2014 wind speed at pts pingtaishan a meteorological station in the center of lake taihu fig 1 was measured hourly since 2013 lee et al 2014 and the wind speed at the two stations was highly correlated xiao et al 2020b therefore long term wind speed data at ds adjusted according to the synchronous wind speed measured at pts 2 3 environmental variables environmental variables including nutrients chlorophyll a chl a dissolved oxygen do and dissolved organic carbon doc together with water diversion scenarios e g water diversion quantity water diversion flowrate and transferred duration were considered from 2002 to 2017 the sampling and measurements of these variables have been previously reported xu et al 2017 xiao et al 2020b in brief do was measured in situ with a multi parameter probe and water samples for environmental parameter measurement were stored in coolers in the field analyses for nutrients chl a and doc were conducted in the laboratory after sampling nutrients total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and total phosphorus tp were determined with a spectrophotometer doc was detected with a toc analyzer and chl a was extracted with 90 hot ethanol and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically 2 4 project of wdyt pollution induced water resources shortage in the lake taihu basin was severe wdyt was carried out to solve the problem freshwater was transferred from the yangtze river into the lake via the wangyu river the taihu basin authority regulated the water diversion project and water from the yangtze river was generally diverted into lake taihu when a low real time water level occurred as a famous project in china the water diversion impact on the water environment of water receiving region gonghu bay has attracted considerable attention monthly data about the water diversion project were obtained from the annual reports of wdyt project at taihu basin authority http www tba gov cn slbthlyglj sj sj html the water diversion period annual input amount of water from the yangtze river to lake taihu and the transferred duration from 2002 to 2017 were presented in supporting information table s1 and fig s1 2 5 statistic analysis the sampling period in the three study regions gonghu bay the central zone and the transitional zone was divided into water diversion and non diversion the differences in co2 level and environmental variables at the three study regions were compared between water diversion and non diversion periods meanwhile the differences in co2 and the variables were also compared between the two regions during the non water diversion period monthly mean data were used for temporal analysis and the monthly mean co2 and variables for each field sampling were calculated using all data within the corresponding regions from 2002 to 2017 then monthly mean data were calculated as mean values for spring march may summer june august autumn september november and winter december february next year and the least significant difference lsd test was carried out to determine differences between seasons simple regression and multi linear regression were carried out to investigate the correlations between the environmental variables and co2 in multi linear regression the variance inflation factor vif was used to determine if multicollinearity was significant when vif was greater than the threshold of 5 any of the variables in the regression equation were eliminated to reduce multicollinearity 3 results 3 1 annual water diversion and its impact on environment the annual water diversion quantity and transferred duration varied greatly from 2002 to 2017 fig s1 the annual water diversion quantity and transferred duration ranged from 1 44 108 m3 to 16 10 108 m3 and 22 days to 209 days from 2002 to 2017 about total 13 billion m3 water have been diverted into the lake it is roughly estimated that annual water diversion quantity from the yangtze river accounted for 9 of the total inflowing water it is worth noting that the annual water diversion was negatively correlated with precipitation and chl a an index of algal biomass fig s2 suggesting the positive effect of the water diversion project on water supply and eutrophication control some environmental variables varied significantly between regions and across time due to the water diversion project table 1 gonghu bay had a significantly p 0 01 higher chl a concentration 18 62 μg l 1 than the central zone 13 40 μg l 1 during the non water diversion period but insignificant p 0 64 difference between the two regions occurred during the water diversion period in contrast significantly p 0 05 higher nh 4 n concentration and lower doc concentration occurred in gonghu bay with water diversion but there were insignificant p 0 05 differences without water diversion within gonghu bay nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations with water diversion were significantly p 0 05 higher than that without water diversion but significantly p 0 05 lower chl a and doc concentration occurred with water diversion for comparison the nh 4 n no 3 n chl a and doc showed insignificant p 0 05 differences between the two periods within the central zone water temperature and do showed negligible p 0 05 differences between time and across regions in summary the water diversion project decreased chl a and doc concentrations but increased nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations in gonghu bay 3 2 annual pco2 variations and its response to water diversion long term sampling showed substantial interannual variability in pco2 fig 2 a from 2002 to 2017 the annual mean pco2 ranged from 374 μatm to 973 μatm in gonghu bay from 433 μatm to 1007 μatm in the central zone and from 353 μatm to 875 μatm in the transitional zone the annual pco2 in gonghu bay was positively correlated with the water diversion flowrate the variability in water diversion flowrate could explain 57 of the observed variation in pco2 fig 2b r 2 0 57 p 0 01 n 16 however the pco2 showed a poor correlation with water diversion flowrate in other regions central zone p 0 08 n 16 transitional zone p 0 10 n 13 fig 2c d 3 3 p co2 comparison between water diversion and non diversion periods the water diversion project influenced the spatial temporal patterns in pco2 the monthly pco2 between gonghu bay and the central zone was highly correlated during the non diversion period while the correlation was relatively weak during the water diversion period fig 3 the monthly pco2 comparison between the two sampling locations within gonghu bay also showed the same results water diversion r 2 0 27 p 0 01 n 46 non water diversion r 2 0 65 p 0 01 n 110 fig s3a however the monthly pco2 between the two sampling locations within central zone was highly correlated during water diversion and non diversion periods fig s3b seasonally pco2 at gonghu bay was relatively uniform during the water diversion period fig 4 a with insignificant p 0 05 differences among seasons in contrast significantly p 0 05 lower pco2 occurred in summer and autumn during non water diversion period fig 4b for comparison the pco2 both showed seasonality at the central zone during water diversion and non diversion periods with significantly lower values occurring in summer and autumn fig 4 importantly the pco2 at gonghu bay was significantly higher p 0 05 in summer and autumn compared to that at central zone during the water diversion period but insignificant p 0 05 differences between the regions occurred in each season during the non water diversion period overall the pco2 at gonghu bay with mean value of 811 296 μatm was significantly p 0 05 higher than that at the central zone 677 310 μatm and the transitional zone 663 175 μatm during the water diversion period fig s4 however the pco2 showed insignificant p 0 05 differences gonghu bay 636 301 μatm central zone 672 310 μatm transitional zone 635 289 μatm among the study region during the non diversion period 3 4 factors influencing pco2 variability the pco2 exhibited different responses to environmental variables during water diversion and non diversion periods especially at gonghu bay long term measurement 2002 2017 showed that monthly pco2 was not associated with chl a at gonghu bay during the water diversion period but significant negative correlation during the non diversion period was found fig 5 a for comparison the pco2 was both negatively correlated with chl a during the water diversion and non diversion periods at the central zone statistic analysis showed the variability in pco2 at gonghu bay was positively correlated with nh 4 n and no 3 n during the water diversion period during the non diversion period the pco2 was positively related with nh 4 n no 3 n tn and doc but negatively correlated with water temperature during non diversion period at the central zone the pco2 was negatively correlated with water temperature and positively correlated with no 3 n and tn both during the water diversion and non diversion periods table s2 multilinear stepwise regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors influencing the annual trend in pco2 results revealed that nh 4 n mg l 1 and water diversion flowrate q 104 m3 d 1 from the yangtze river to the lake could best explain the variability in pco2 μatm from 2002 to 2017 at gonghu bay the multilinear regression function was 2 pc o 2 634 71 n h 4 n 0 39 q 198 73 the function could explain 69 of the large interannual variability in the pco2 at gonghu bay r 2 0 69 p 0 05 meanwhile results also showed that nh 4 n mg l 1 and no 3 n mg l 1 explained 64 of interannual variability in the pco2 at the central zone r 2 0 64 p 0 05 3 pc o 2 382 40 nh 4 n 321 46 no 3 n 281 20 the vif between nh 4 n and q in equation 2 and between nh 4 n and no 3 n in equation 3 were 1 71 and 1 15 respectively the vif values were lower than the threshold of 5 implying that multicollinearity was negligible 3 5 co2 flux estimation during diversion and non diversion periods the co2 exchange flux between the lake atmosphere was estimated according to the pco2 measurement via equation 1 it is estimated that the co2 flux at gonghu bay central zone and transitional zone were 12 91 mmol m 2 d 1 12 65 mmol m 2 d 1 and 12 18 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively with insignificant p 0 05 differences across the region however the co2 flux at gonghu bay 17 28 mmol m 2 d 1 with water diversion was significantly higher than that at the other two regions fig s4 the estimated co2 flux with the water diversion was 54 higher than that without diversion at gonghu bay in contrast the co2 flux at central zone and transitional zone showed insignificant differences between the two periods fig s4 spatially the pco2 and co2 flux as functions of distance from wangyu river during the water diversion period the values decreased significantly with distance increase fig 6 a for comparison minor spatial variability of pco2 and co2 flux were found during non water diversion fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 causes of large pco2 during river to lake water diversion the long term 2002 2017 field sampling showed that river to lake water diversion increased the pco2 figs 4 and s4 specifically significantly p 0 05 higher pco2 occurred during the water diversion period at the water receiving region leading to the notable spatial heterogeneity in pco2 between water receiving and non water receiving regions 811 μatm versus 677 μatm for comparison the pco2 at the two regions were 636 μatm and 672 μatm during the non diversion period respectively the increase in pco2 during the water diversion period may arise from less co2 uptake by algal biomass more co2 production due to nutrient enrichment and direct co2 input by river discharge algal blooms increase primary production which is likely to lead decrease in pco2 of eutrophic lakes pacheco et al 2014 grasset et al 2020 instead a significant negative correlation between the pco2 and chl a an index of algal abundance was found in this study fig 5 however it is worth noting that the chl a concentration was significantly p 0 05 lower and not correlated with pco2 at gonghu bay during the water diversion period table 1 and fig 5a one of the main aims of wdyt project is to control the eutrophication and reduce the chl a concentration qin et al 2010 our data also showed low chl a concentration occurred with water diversion at gonghu bay table 1 and fig s2 thus water diversion induced low chl a may contribute to the high pco2 at gonghu bay via reducing co2 uptake junger et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that lake pco2 increased with nutrient enrichment kortelainen et al 2006 natchimuthu et al 2017 the lake pco2 was positively correlated with nutrient tn nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations table s2 this was consistent with previous studies suggesting nutrients could increase the pco2 via stimulating respiration wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2020a meanwhile our long term sampling found water diversion increased the nutrient concentration e g nh 4 n and no 3 n at water receiving gonghu bay table 1 likely caused by high nutrient loading in the inflow to the wangyu river dai et al 2020 the external nutrient loading input may stimulate co2 production and increase pco2 kortelainen et al 2006 wang et al 2017 additionally nh 4 n and water diversion flowrate together explained 69 of the interannual variability in the pco2 at gonghu bay r 2 0 69 p 0 05 equation 2 from 2002 to 2017 which also suggested the role of the external nutrient loading in determining co2 variability external co2 input from watershed can also increase lake pco2 previous studies have found that external co2 input can directly increase pco2 in lakes weyhenmeyer et al 2015 wilkinson et al 2016 the pco2 at gonghu bay was significantly higher than that at central zone and transitional zone during the water sampling period but the differences between them was insignificant during the non diversion period fig s4a spatially the pco2 decreased significantly with distance from wangyu river during the water diversion period but no variability was found during non water diversion fig s3 and 6 field sampling found pco2 in wangyu river was significantly higher than that in sampling location at gonghu bay and the pco2 in sampling locations of the river and lake was positively correlated fig s5 thus external co2 input via the diversion channel wangyu river may influence the lake pco2 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 xiao et al 2020b 4 2 change in seasonal pco2 and the role of water diversion previous studies have found strong co2 seasonal variability especially in eutrophic lakes klaus et al 2019 morales williams et al 2020 xiao et al 2020b the pco2 in gonghu bay varied seasonally during the non diversion period with significantly p 0 05 values in summer and autumn which was consistent with pco2 seasonal variation at the central zone fig 4b and other studies trolle et al 2012 qi et al 2020 however the pco2 was relatively homogenous across seasons at gonghu bay during the water diversion period fig 4a additionally another difference from other lakes kortelainen et al 2006 kosten et al 2010 finlay et al 2015 was the pco2 temporal variability in gonghu bay with water diversion was unrelated to water temperature table s2 both of these suggested that water diversion influenced the seasonal variability in pco2 river to lake water diversion increased the pco2 at gonghu bay however the water diversion effects varied seasonally fig 4 the pco2 in gonghu bay was significantly p 0 05 higher than that at central zone in summer and autumn still the differences between gonghu bay and central zone were insignificant p 0 05 in spring and winter peak chl a appeared in summer and autumn at the central zone due to warm water temperature xu et al 2017 leading to large co2 uptake and decreases in pco2 pacheco et al 2014 grasset et al 2020 in contrast higher pco2 at gonghu bay would be retained due to the reduction in chl a caused by water diversion junger et al 2019 meanwhile a substantial pco2 from rivers of the taihu basin was observed in summer and autumn due to high water temperature yu et al 2017 xiao et al 2021 the external input from rivers with high co2 was likely to increase the lake pco2 at that time mcdonald et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 thus the change in seasonal co2 patterns may be associated with water diversion via decreasing internal consumption and increasing external input 4 3 implication for co2 budget estimation spatial variability in co2 flux within lake has received great concerns to accurately estimate the co2 budget natchimuthu et al 2017 denfeld et al 2020 qi et al 2020 the co2 flux showed weak spatial variability without water diversion based on cross region comparisons however significantly higher co2 flux from water receiving gonghu bay occurred during the water diversion period fig s4 suggesting water diversion was likely to influence the lake co2 flux spatial dynamics mcdonald et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2015 some studies have shown precipitation driven water diversion could either increase co2 emission due to external co2 input via runoff or decrease emission due to dilution li et al 2018b junger et al 2019 wallin et al 2020 xiao et al 2021 our results suggested the hydrologic regimes river to lake water diversion significantly increased co2 emission primarily due to reducing co2 uptake via phytoplankton dilution junger et al 2019 stimulating co2 production via nutrient enrichment kortelainen et al 2006 and increasing co2 input from watershed weyhenmeyer et al 2015 therefore the water diversion effects should be considered to better understanding co2 cycle and to avoid the underestimation of co2 flux in lakes identifying the drivers of long term multi decades co2 trends from lakes is vital to predicting future co2 emissions finlay et al 2015 seekell and gudasz 2016 our results indicated that the water diversion project accounted for the large interannual variability of pco2 at water receiving gonghu bay fig 2 water diversion flowrate and nh 4 n together explained 69 of the variability from 2002 to 2017 meanwhile the nh 4 n concentration was also influenced by the water diversion project in the lake dai et al 2020 which in turn emphasized the significance of water diversion previous studies have demonstrated that hydrologic processes sustained lake co2 emissions weyhenmeyer et al 2015 bogard and del giorgio 2016 gomez gener et al 2016 based on the water diversion data and the co2 sampling figs 2 and s2 we estimated that the hydrologic regimes increased the co2 emission flux by 54 our results suggested the lake co2 responded significantly to the water diversion project which should be considered to improve understanding of the contribution of lake co2 emissions to the global c budget the river to lake water diversion influences warming and eutrophication effects on the lake co2 variability lake water temperature and eutrophication have increased due to climate and environmental change paerl and paul 2012 woolway et al 2020 which have been projected to seriously affect lake co2 budget estimation based on the correlation between water temperature chl a and co2 finlay et al 2015 kortelainen et al 2006 kosten et al 2010 morales williams et al 2020 however our results showed the lake co2 was unrelated to water temperature with water diversion table 1 which was similar to previous studies showing that non thermal factors may confound the temperature influence on co2 davidson et al 2015 meanwhile water diversion could dilute phytoplankton and increase external loadings input leading to the absence of eutrophication effects junger et al 2019 clearly the role of hydrological processes of river to lake water diversion should be considered in evaluating the effects of warming and eutrophication of lake co2 cycling 4 4 study limitations and future outlook like most studies there are limitations in the current study overall the effects of water diversion on co2 were evaluated at seasonal annual and spatial scales it is worth noting that diel variations in lake co2 were significant due to the different metabolism patterns day and night yang et al 2019 however the water diversion effects on diurnal co2 remained unclear due to the difficulty of field sampling considering nutrient and chl a were associated with lake co2 variability kortelainen et al 2006 xiao et al 2020b and water diversion can influence the two variables dai et al 2020 tang et al 2021 it is reasonable to propose that water diversion may play a role in regulating daily change in co2 our study suggested water diversion increased pco2 and associated co2 emission flux still the relative importance of different sources and processes e g in situ production consumption and external input to the excess co2 in the lake was unclear posing a challenge to make the river to lake water diversion project a co2 neutral option additionally a previous study has shown that doc degradation produced more co2 and can increase pco2 in lakes lapierre et al 2013 interestingly our long term data found water diversion increased pco2 but decrease doc during the water diversion period table 1 suggesting the uncoupling of trends in co2 and doc nydahl et al 2017 although a substantial portion of doc could be derived from phytoplankton blooms and low doc may result from phytoplankton dilute junger et al 2019 xiao et al 2020a it is likely that external input was crucial in fueling co2 emission from lakes with low doc maberly et al 2013 further study is needed to explain the uncoupling of long term trends in co2 and doc and better understand the sources sustaining the emission from lakes 5 conclusions long term 2002 2017 field measurements with high sampling frequency suggested the river to lake water diversion project increased the pco2 and associated co2 emission flux at water receiving gonghu bay meanwhile the water diversion project decreased chl a concentration but increased nutrient loadings on average the co2 emission flux increased by 54 with the water diversion project the water diversion project increased the lake co2 level mainly through three potential mechanisms 1 reducing co2 uptake via phytoplankton dilution 2 increasing co2 production via nutrient enrichment and 3 significant co2 input from the catchment the role of water diversion accounted for the co2 variability in space considerable spatial heterogeneity across regions and within region was found during the water diversion period however weak seasonal variability was observed at water receiving gonghu bay the water diversion project and nh 4 n explained 69 of large interannual variability pco2 at gonghu bay over 16 years 2002 2017 meanwhile the co2 was unrelated to water temperature and eutrophication with water diversion these implied that the role of river to lake water diversion should be considered in evaluating the effects of warming and eutrophication of the lake co2 budget estimation and improving understanding of the contribution of lake co2 emissions to the

3927,low frequency but high magnitude flooding is becoming more frequent and can be well documented by event stratigraphy low frequency flooding deposits lfds were discovered during a field investigation in the holocene loess palaeosol profile at xucun fhxc which is situated at the front of the second terrace t2 along the middle fenhe river a multi prong approach combining geochemical and sedimentological indexes i e concentrations of cr v ni co cu zn rb mn pb and sr magnetic susceptibility and particle size distribution was used to distinguish the sedimentary characteristics and environmental dynamics of lfds these proxies show that lfds were well sorted clayey silt and carried in suspension during high energy extreme flooding currents with firstly a high water level and secondly the river having a relatively stagnant environment based on the flooding stage indicators magnitudes of the low frequency flooding discharges at the site were reconstructed to be 13 480 13 590 m3 s the timing of the identified low frequency flooding cluster episode was dated to 4200 3900 a bp by the optically stimulated luminescence osl dating technique it agreed well with stratigraphic correlations of other existing well dated flooding profiles in the middle reaches of the yellow river this case study presents long term low frequency flooding records and their sedimentary dynamics based on high spatial temporal resolution systematic event stratigraphy which advances understanding low frequency flooding generation mechanism and improves upon predictions for occurrences and magnitudes of future extreme flooding keywords case study low frequency flooding event stratigraphy magnitude frequency 1 introduction low frequency flooding is a rare event and barely observed in small basins it is characterized by a high magnitude and this relates to the lower quantile 0 1 of long term flooding frequency distribution kjeldsen et al 2014 strupczewski et al 2017 wesemael et al 2019 global warming amplifies increases in the frequency and magnitude of low frequency flooding in recent decades low frequency flooding as the most devastating type of natural disasters in japan tanaka et al 2020 south korea bae and chang 2019 and china hu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 peng et al 2018 xian et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2019 is becoming frequent with an increasing magnitude in 2013 more than 3 70 million people were affected by mega floods with a direct loss of cny 37 million in the amur river basin jia et al 2020 it has been reported that more than 279 rivers in china flooded with higher flow stages than the warning water level in 2019 and direct flooding losses totaled cny 106 05 billion there were 35 26 million people were flooded 338 flood related deaths and 650 000 houses were destroyed in 2018 consequently analyzing the low frequency flooding characteristics including magnitude frequency and timing is urged to predict and manage future flooding events pre instrumental data from historical documents or geological archives e g lake sediments and fluvial deposits are of great significance to reconstruct low frequency flooding over centennial to millennia timescales furthermore reconstructions of palaeofloods using slackwater deposits were conducted in east asia including japan grossman 2001 ishii et al 2017 south korea kim et al 2017 and mongolia kim and tanaka 2017 fluvial low frequency flooding deposits provide long lasting evidence of peak water levels and typically consist of silt textured depositional layers within vertical sedimentary sequences preserved on the front terraces of the yellow river huang et al 2012 li and huang 2017 li et al 2019 long term flooding datasets incorporated by low frequency flooding events can reveal flooding cluster episodes and climate abrupt variations a long term flooding discharge frequency relation can help to improve our assessment of modern flood risks and regional climate changes the fenhe river one of the major tributaries of the yellow river the main source of water in shanxi province and a key river for understanding long term evolution of chinese civilization was selected as a case study fig 1 a its basin is a region where industry and population are widely distributed and it generates 46 of the gross industrial output and is home to 41 of the entire province s population li et al 2015 the per capita water resources in shanxi province amount to 381 m3 which is less than 20 of china nationally and it is the worst affected province in china sun et al 2013 given that increases in water consumption and overexploitation are threatening the basin s water supplies it is imperative to document a local quantitative long term flooding sequence so that a more accurate and reliable magnitude and frequency of flooding is recorded this will enable water conservation projects to be designed for the purpose of floodrisk assessment and reclamation in the fenhe river basin according to historical records and observations there were 150 major flooding events peak discharge 100 m3 s from 1951 to 2008 in the fenhe river basin fig 1b especially the middle and downstream sections which were flooded almost every two years in the basin the designed river conservation systems refer to flood discharges occurring every 20 or 100 years however recorded data on flooding events are too recent locally they only began during the 1950 s and do not reveal actual trends in flooding on millennial and centennial timescales baker 1987 benito et al 2015 consequently only a few decades of observed records are available limiting our ability to understand the characteristics of low frequency flooding events and long term variations liu et al 2015 till now there has been no hydrological reconstruction focused on long term low frequency flooding in the fenhe river hence event stratigraphies are necessary to obtain the quantitative datasets of long term flooding events such as water level discharge and velocity in order to further reveal long term flooding cluster episodes and climate abrupt variations clarify the relationship between regional hydro climatic deterioration and prehistoric cultural decline we have carried out extensive field investigations on event stratigraphies along the fenhe river in this study we focus on 1 explain the connection between sedimentary characteristics and environmental dynamics of lfds 2 reconstruct the magnitude and frequency of low frequency flooding events and 3 understand the historical impact of low frequency flooding events on local human settlements thus this case study shedding new light on the quantitative relationship between event stratigraphy and magnitude of the low frequency flooding on the fenhe river and its response to climate abrupt variations 2 case study area the fenhe river which is the second largest tributary of the yellow river has its source in the guanqin mountains at 1670 m a s l and after 695 km flows into the yellow river fig 1a it has many tributaries with a sinuosity of 1 68 and is characterized by a dendritic hydrometric network li et al 2015 located in the eastern loess plateau region its basin has a drainage area of 39 471 km2 and average gradient of 1 11 in the middle reaches of the yellow river in central china yang et al 2018 it has a temperate monsoonal climate typified by large seasonal amplitudes in temperature and precipitation the mean temperature is about 9 and average annual precipitation is about 504 mm in the basin sun et al 2013 li et al 2015 due to the influence of the east asian summer monsoon easm 84 7 of the major flooding along the fenhe river occurs from june to september this event is triggered by local short duration heavy rainstorms that account for almost 80 of the total annual rainfall during the rainy season fig 1b zhaocheng gauging station 36 23 n 111 40 e was originally built in 1951 on the middle reaches of the fenhe river to ascertain hydrological telemetry from 1951 to 2008 a total of fifty eight maximum annual peak discharge data was gathered from this gauging station two documented floods occurred at the station in 1843 and 1917 with peak discharges of 5450 m3 s and 3740 m3 s respectively as one of the birthplaces of chinese civilization numerous archaeological sites distributed throughout the fenhe river basin were dated to the late longshan culture 4400 4000 a bp and xia shang periods 4000 3100 a bp li et al 2017a the taosi site 4300 3900 a bp which is located at a higher elevation on the terrace 600 m a s l of the fenhe river is the largest settlement in the middle yellow river valley it represents the origins of chinese civilization li et al 2014 3 methods 3 1 field work detailed post event field investigations of low frequency flooding marks and hydrological parameter measurements of channel cross sections were undertaken along the course of the fenhe river the well preserved profile consisting of low frequency flooding deposits hereafter lfds and providing evidence for low frequency flooding reconstructions came from the xucun fhxc site 36 36 56 n 111 40 05 e located at linghuo canyon in the middle reaches of the fenhe river fig 1c d two alluvial terraces were observed along the river valley the first terrace t1 is 8 10 m and the second terrace t2 is 16 24 m above the fenhe river s normal water level the fhxc profile with a top elevation of 573 m a s l situated at the front of the second terrace t2 on the west bank is approximately 22 m above the normal water level xucun village began during the xia dynasty 2070 1600 bce and according to the archaeological discoveries served as a ferry point for transporting passengers and goods li et al 2014 in total fifty samples were collected at 5 cm intervals in situ for sedimentary analysis three optically stimulated luminescence osl samples of flooding event stratigraphy were obtained from the fhxc profile to determine the chronology moreover the quartzite sandstone bedrock channel which represents relative stability was suitable for hydrological calculations as attempted by this study 3 2 sedimentological and geochemical analysis for more details concerning characteristics transportation processes and sedimentary environment of the lfds in the middle reaches of the fenhe river multi proxy indexes of all fifty samples including the geochemical distribution of elements gde magnetic susceptibility x and particle size distribution psd were measured at the shaanxi normal university geochemical analysis of trace elements were measured using a panalytical pw2403 x ray fluorescence spectrometer guo et al 2014 duplicate samples blank samples and standard reference samples gss 1 and gsd 12 were all implemented to control the quality of the experimental work both low frequency xlf 470 hz and high frequency xhf 4700 hz magnetic susceptibilities were detected when using a bartington ms2 meter particle size distributions psd of samples were determined using a malven mastersizer s laser analyzer with 100 bins ranging from 0 02 to 2000 μm following the removal of secondary carbonates and organic matter with hcl 10 and h2o2 30 and adding a dispersant of napo3 6 friedman et al 1992 the parameters were calculated statistically with folk and ward s 1957 method determining the color of stratigraphic sequences meant referring to the munsell color chart 3 3 osl dating the chronology of low frequency flooding events was understood using the osl dating program in the tl osl dating laboratory at shaanxi normal university the osl measurements of 90 125 μm grain fraction were done using a risø tl osl da 20 reader equipped with a 90sr 90y beta source delivering 0 081 gy s and an infrared laser diode 830 nm 145 mw cm2 the reader simulated the quartz particles with blue light 470 30 nm 50 mw cm2 leds grün 2003 guo et al 2018 knight and evans 2018 for all samples the uranium u thorium th and potassium k content was tested by the neutron activation analysis naa method at the china institute of atomic energy beijing the gravimetric water content was equal to the ratio of the mass of water to the mass of samples after drying in an oven the equivalent dose de was determined using the single aliquot regenerative sar protocol murray and wintle 2000 all of the pretreatments and measurements were conducted in the osl tl dating laboratory shaanxi normal university 3 4 magnitude reconstructions the core of the experimental strategy in this study consisted of reconstructing the flooding peak stage and quantizations of the peak discharge in bedrock canyons rivers have slackwater environments at the time of the flooding peak stages appear and the flooding could be regarded as a stationarity flow peak stages of the low frequency flooding were estimated using the slackwater flow method guo et al 2017 each peak stage ps is summed from the bottom elevation be of end point lfds and the slackwater depth sd the slackwater depth sd is calculated by the ratio of the lfd thickness t to the bulk of suspended sediment load ssl of the flood p which is the ratio of the volume of ssl in floodwater to the volume of floodwater as a result the ps was inferred from the following equations 1 ps b e s d 2 sd t p 1 where p was inferred from the ratio of the suspended sediment concentration in floodwater at the cross section to the specific weight of ssl i e 2650 kg m3 the value of p in palaeoflood can often be insteaded by that of the ssl in the modern large flood guo et al 2017 according to the maximum ssl of 770 kg m3 which was observed at the zhaocheng gauging station cross section fig 1b in the middle fenhe river during the large flood that occurred on may 10 1969 the parameter p estimation is about 29 the peak discharge of the low frequency flooding was simulated employing the slope area method sam the most commonly utilized method in palaeoflood hydrology li and huang 2017 this method is based on manning s equation 3 q p n 1 a r 2 3 s 1 2 where qp is the peak discharge of the flooding flow a is the cross sectional area of the flow at the flooding stage n is the roughness coefficient of the stream bed r is the hydraulic radius which is the ratio of the cross sectional area a of the stream to its wetted perimeter and s is the channel slope gordon et al 2004 the manning s roughness coefficient n was obtained from the equation as follows 4 n n l n m n r 3 where roughness values with suffixes of m l and r indicate the main channel and flood channel to the left and right of the river respectively roughness values n were assigned based on the fenhe river s channel properties and by referring to the hydrological calculation norms for hydraulic engineering in china the river channel geometry and slope in the middle reaches were measured at the fhxc site using an electronic distance measurer and a gps in association with large scale contour maps 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of lfds stratigraphy stratigraphic sequences are well exposed and demarcations are clearly differentiated in the fhxc profile fig 1d a typical flooding sediment unit representing a phase of frequent extreme flooding is intercalated into the mid holocene palaeosol s0 in this profile and divides the s0 into two parts s01 and s02 specific stratigraphic classifications and systematic descriptions of the fhxc profile are presented in table 1 field evidence made it possible to characterize the deposits created by the low frequency flooding event as composed of dull yellow orange parallel or waving beddings and moderately to well sorted strata table 1 due to sedimentary features namely munsell color texture and structure the flooding unit wasfurther subdivided into four sub layers lfd1 1 lfd1 2 lfd1 3 and lfd1 4 these records suggest that each sub layer s sedimentation represents an individual flooding event and the key to how much hydrodynamic force was evident to carry out source identification effectively it is necessary to analyze the distribution of trace elements in each stratigraphic sequence of the fhxc these analyses help us to fully understand the geochemical characteristics of the fenhe river flooding sediments and variations in regional climate also the geochemical baseline values of elements in the parent materials represent the background levels of elements in the sediments of the study area the cr v ni co cu zn rb mn pb and sr content in the fhxc profile were in the following respective ranges 63 3 77 1 79 5 101 9 28 7 35 1 12 3 19 2 22 8 30 6 63 9 78 4 83 7 106 6 572 4 717 8 19 9 25 3 and 195 3 230 2 ppm trace elements geochemical distributions of stratigraphic sequences further confirmed our stratigraphic subdivisions in the fhxc profile the geochemical concentrations of the tested elements in ts l0 and s01 layers were much larger than the relevant background values of the elements in l1 meaning that the trace metals accumulated in l0 and s01 had resulted from weathering and pedogenic modification processes especially s01 was fully matured during the warmest and wettest holocene climatic optimum with intensivepedogenesis in favor of trace elements accumulations huang et al 2012 another interesting point is that ts in the surface was disturbed by anthropogenic activities such as mineral exploiting and metal smelting in the fenhe river basin since 1500 however variations in the tested trace elements content in the lfds layers appeared to rapidly decrease between s01 and s02 which were formed in the mid holocene fig 2 the mean concentrations of cr v ni co cu zn rb mn pb and sr in the lfds were in the 65 1 84 6 29 8 13 4 24 1 65 4 93 8 613 8 21 0 and 211 6 ppm ranges respectively the amounts of ten trace elements in lfds were all smaller than those of the parent materials l1 malan loess at the bottom of the fhxc profile suggesting that the lfds had undergone long distance transportation by flooding flows it also indicated that their origins were formed differently from the parent materials a major sink for trace elements suggests that the lfds underwent a series of physicochemical changes such as reduction reaction leaching and migration in the process of flooding inundation remarkable peaks present at the boundary between the top of the flood deposit lfd1 4 and bottom of the s01 at about 125 cm depth suggests that lfds were not affected by weathering and pedogenesis but the higher location of the deposition during high flooding stage represents the more powerful uplift force of flooding in the internal hydrodynamics scenario li et al 2019 results enable a differentiation of the lfds from loess and palaeosols also show that some climate abnormalities existed with extreme flooding in the mid holocene at the study site magnetic susceptibility x was successfully used to identify flooding deposits from loess and palaeosol sequences in the yellow river basin huang et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 the trend variations of xlf and xhf curves in the fhxc profile are consistent the xlf values of lfd samples in the fhxc profile vary from 37 8 to 42 1 10 8 m3 kg with an average value of 39 6 10 8 m3 kg and this is lower than the mean values of eolian loess l0 and l1 44 7 and 41 4 10 8 m3 kg and the mean values of mid holocene palaeosol s01 and s02 43 3 and 42 8 10 8 m3 kg in a flooded environment the magnetite usually presents selective dissolution which leads to xlf values of lfd samples being low the differences in magnetic susceptibility of the fhxc profile indicate that the lfds formed during or shortly after flood peak recession without experiencing weathering and pedogenesis furthermore their traits depend on the suspended sediments being carried by flooding flows 4 2 sedimentary environment of lfds particle size analysis provides a more precise identification and characterization of the flooding sediments and their depositional setting huang et al 2017 the particle size parameters reveal depositional process hydrodynamic conditions and transportation mechanism in this stretch of the river the psd curves in fig 3 reveal that the amounts of coarse silt 16 63 μm in the lfds are higher than those of aeolian deposits including ts l0 l1 lt and s0 in the fhxc profile and the typical loess the amount of 42 8 in this region li et al 2013 in contrast the amount of fine silt 2 16 μm are smaller than those of aeolian deposits in the fhxc profile and the typical loess the amounts of 47 6 in this region li et al 2013 thus the lfds are dominated by coarse silt the amounts of fine sand 63 125 μm and sand 100 μm in the lfds are lower than those of aeolian deposits including l1 lt and s0 but they all are less than 10 in the profile it means that the lfds and aeolian deposits were delivered by different driving forces one is northwest wind the other is flood the frequency curves of psd in the palaeosol s01 and s02 and loess l0 l1 and lt exhibit two peak values 6 12 μm and 35 55 μm but the lfds curves in the fhxc profile present a single peak value 25 45 μm fig 4 a the particle size cumulative frequency curves show that aeolian deposits loess and palaeosol are dominated by fine silt while the lfds are mainly composed of coarse silt in the fhxc profile fig 4b median particle size md values of lfds ranging from 17 99 μm to 21 12 μm and their mean particle size mz values ranging from 22 62 μm to 24 63 μm are higher than those of other stratigraphic sequences in the fhxc profile the combination of psd frequency curves md and mz indexes means that these lfds are dominated by coarse grained sediments confirming that high energy sedimentation had occurred in this lfds unit furthermore the triangular diagram of psd demonstrates that all the lfds layers in the fhxc profile are clayey silt in nature and different from loess and palaeosols fig 4c the proportions of clay in the deposits reflect the link between finer composite particles in stagnant flooding with low velocities particle size probability cumulative curves illustrate that the lfds were deposited mainly from suspension load fraction transported by the flooding with an average proportion of about 72 while saltation population accounted for 27 fig 4d sorting σ values between 1 48 and 1 77 mean that the lfds are well sorted the sharpness or peakedness of the particle size frequency curve and the degree of symmetry of particle size distribution are measured by the kurtosis kg of 1 01 and skewness sk of 0 30 respectively these particle size parameters show that lfds are mostly coarse silt well sorted coarse skewed and leptokurtic this consequently indicates that the lfds were carried in suspension during high energy extreme flooding currents characterized by firstly a high water level and secondly the river having a relatively stagnant environment 4 3 magnitudes of low frequency flooding events in situ reconstruction of flooding magnitudes based on geological archives can provide a real long term record li et al 2019 the bottom elevations of lfds at the fhxc site ranged from 572 18 to 572 33 m a s l based on the slackwater flow depth method i e eqs 1 and 2 palaeoflood depths of four lfds layers were between 22 35 and 22 50 m thus peak stages of well documented lfds at the study site varied from 572 35 and 572 50 m a s l table 2 the river channel geometry in relation to the cross section i i is presented in fig 1c and fig 5 a b the river reach at the fhxc site lies in a narrow and deep bedrock valley and the channel bottom is relatively stable resulting in a single channel system with bedrock protrusions the bedrock confined channel geometry at the maximum stage is known or can be approximated because no major changes can be assumed to have occurred throughout the holocene liu et al 2015 li and huang 2017 based on contour maps and field measurement the average channel slope is 1 11 in this river stretch the channel was characterized by a straight bank some pools and shoals clean lower stages more ineffective slopes and sections stony sections which points to the roughness coefficient n is 0 040 at the study site based on the peak stages the maximum peak discharges of lfds were estimated to be 13 480 13 590 m3 s according to the sam method i e eq 3 at the fhxc site table 2 these reconstructed palaeoflood peak discharges are larger than twice the maximum systematic gauged record of 2800 m3 s july 25th 1957 at the zhaocheng gauging station on the fenhe river as already found in previous studies reconstructed palaeoflood peak discharges are higher than 2 5 3 0 times the maximum documented flooding data on the jinghe river beiluohe river and yellow river huang et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 li et al 2019 these reconstructed palaeoflood results agree wellwith the relationship between peak discharges and drainage areas of global maximum flooding events expressed by the equation q 21d0 73 fig 5c and established by baker 2006 the curves offer further convincing support to the conclusion that reconstructions of low frequency discharges are reliable in the stable bedrock reaches of the fenhe river 4 4 timing of low frequency flooding events a reliable chronology of each event stratigraphy was established by the osl dating and stratigraphic correlations with other existing well dated jh ygz huang et al 2012 blh chz profiles zhang et al 2015 in the middle reaches of the yellow river fig 1a stratigraphic correlations witnessed that event stratigraphies of low frequency flooding in the fhxc profile were mainly formed in the mid holocene fig 6 three samples of lfds in the fhxc profile were dated to 4190 580 a 4020 450 a and 3910 580 a respectively table 3 these osl dates suggest that these low frequency flooding events took place during 4200 3900 a bp which is defined the beginning of the current meghalayan age in the holocene epoch the interval was contemporaneous with the transition fromthe late longshan culture 4400 4000 a bp to xia shang periods 4000 3100 a bp corresponding to the taosi culture period in the fenhe river basin three luminescence ages of the fhxc profile also demonstrate an increase in age with depth table 3 reflecting the lfds deposition over time under stable sedimentary environmental conditions especially during the interval of climatic deterioration at 4200 3900 a bp settlers responded to the abrupt climatic events that coincided with extreme flooding by leaving the plains that susceptible to flooding for the plateaus hills and mountains with high elevations in the fenhe river basin timmermann and friedrich 2016 li et al 2017a in fact the taosi site located on the terrace with an elevation of 600 m a s l was ca 40 m higher than the water level of the fenhe river that was further confirmed the overbank flooding occurred frequently during the period fig 5d furthermore episodes of social destabilization wars and dynastic cycles in china were more frequent during the interval hosner et al 2016 wang et al 2016 some other prominent low frequency flooding records at 3900 4200 a bp of the climatic transitional period were found on the yellow river and its other tributaries fig 6 such as the jinghe river huang et al 2012 and beiluohe river zhang et al 2015 also it was reported that two extreme flooding events occurred at 4900 4600 a bp and 4100 3800 a bp in the middle yangtze river that have accelerated the decline of the shijiahe culture 4100 3800 a bp wu et al 2017 as well the cooling arid climatic event at 4200 a bp was well documented by a stalagmite from dongge cave wang et al 2005 the late neolithic cultures such as the qijia culture in the upper yellow river and the laohushan culture in southern inner mongolia in china terminated abruptly at 4000 a bp dong et al 2013 wang et al 2016 in these cases the remarkable climatic shift involving a sharp increase in occurrences of drought cooling arid conditions or high magnitude low frequency flooding played an important role in the transition of neolithic bronze cultures throughout china consequently the ancient settlement migrations and devastation of the taosi culture in the fenhe river basin mainly resulted from the regional dramatic climate fluctuations a finding that is consistent with frequent extreme flooding events li et al 2014 li et al 2017a in addition pollen percentages from dali lake wen et al 2017 and gonghai lake chen et al 2015 and the stalagmite oxygen isotope values from theshang cave wang et al 2018 all of which are located in the domain of the east asian summer monsoon suggested that the monsoon precipitation fluctuated but with an overall decreasing trend in northern and central china during the period of 4200 3900 a bp corresponding to the 4200 a bp cooling climatic event worldwide caused by the weaker east asia summer monsoon li et al 2015 as well as relatively strong el niño southern oscillation enso activities zhu et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 again it indicated that extreme floods triggered by heavy rainstorms occurred in the study region accompanied by frequent droughts during the 4200 a bp event 4 5 frequency of long term flooding events the log pearson type iii lp iii distribution method is extensively used for flooding frequency estimation of non continuous data series including extreme values schendel and thongwichian 2017 solari et al 2017 burn and whitfield 2018 a statistical analysis of reconstructed low frequency flooding historical flooding and observed annual flooding series afs 1951 2008 at the zhaocheng station was performed by fitting a lp iii distribution fig 7 a regional long term flooding frequency curve built as a red line in fig 7 reveals that frequencies of reconstructed palaeoflood peak discharges were 0 01 in the lower quantile of the curve as a result the reconstructed peak discharge of 13 590 m3 s corresponds to a large return period lasting 10 000 years table 4 the discharges for 1000 and 100 year flooding events were 10 600 m3 s and 4550 m3 s respectively statistics show that 78 6 of extreme floods were caused by large scale rainstorms in the basin and the flood hydrograph was characterized by a rapid rise and mitigatory recession shanxi province department of water resources 2014 such as a severe flood of the wuding river occurred in 2017 and its peak stage rose nearly 20 m in suide county yao et al 2018 5 conclusions in the case study low frequency flooding events that occurred on the middle fenhe river during 4200 3900 a bp were identified based on event stratigraphy multi proxy indexed were applied to reveal that lfds were well sorted clayey silt in nature and carried in suspension during high energy extreme flooding currents with a high water level and the river having a relatively stagnant environment combining the slackwater flow depths inferred by the thicknesses of lfds magnitudes of low frequency flooding at the studied site were reconstructed to be 13 480 13 590 m3 s with peak stages varying from 572 35 and 572 50 m a s l at the study site the results were larger than twice of the maximum systematic gauged record of 2800 m3 s and the peak discharges drainage area relationship for the fenhe river basin could be expressed as q 21d0 73 coupling with real low frequency flooding data a regional long term magnitude frequency curve was obtained which improved the precise of flood risk assessment and prediction future low frequency flooding events in the basin the high magnitude low frequency flooding events were highly sensitive to regional monsoonal climatic variability in the holocene a flooding clusters episode at 4200 3900 a bp is comparable with the ancient settlement migrations and devastation of the taosi culture in the fenhe river basin moreover synchronous high magnitude low frequency flooding on the yellow river and yangtze river played an important role in the transition of neolithic bronze age in china these findings potentially contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between prehistoric cultural decline and regional hydro climatic deterioration credit authorship contribution statement yuqin li conceptualization methodology investigation writing

3927,low frequency but high magnitude flooding is becoming more frequent and can be well documented by event stratigraphy low frequency flooding deposits lfds were discovered during a field investigation in the holocene loess palaeosol profile at xucun fhxc which is situated at the front of the second terrace t2 along the middle fenhe river a multi prong approach combining geochemical and sedimentological indexes i e concentrations of cr v ni co cu zn rb mn pb and sr magnetic susceptibility and particle size distribution was used to distinguish the sedimentary characteristics and environmental dynamics of lfds these proxies show that lfds were well sorted clayey silt and carried in suspension during high energy extreme flooding currents with firstly a high water level and secondly the river having a relatively stagnant environment based on the flooding stage indicators magnitudes of the low frequency flooding discharges at the site were reconstructed to be 13 480 13 590 m3 s the timing of the identified low frequency flooding cluster episode was dated to 4200 3900 a bp by the optically stimulated luminescence osl dating technique it agreed well with stratigraphic correlations of other existing well dated flooding profiles in the middle reaches of the yellow river this case study presents long term low frequency flooding records and their sedimentary dynamics based on high spatial temporal resolution systematic event stratigraphy which advances understanding low frequency flooding generation mechanism and improves upon predictions for occurrences and magnitudes of future extreme flooding keywords case study low frequency flooding event stratigraphy magnitude frequency 1 introduction low frequency flooding is a rare event and barely observed in small basins it is characterized by a high magnitude and this relates to the lower quantile 0 1 of long term flooding frequency distribution kjeldsen et al 2014 strupczewski et al 2017 wesemael et al 2019 global warming amplifies increases in the frequency and magnitude of low frequency flooding in recent decades low frequency flooding as the most devastating type of natural disasters in japan tanaka et al 2020 south korea bae and chang 2019 and china hu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 peng et al 2018 xian et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2019 is becoming frequent with an increasing magnitude in 2013 more than 3 70 million people were affected by mega floods with a direct loss of cny 37 million in the amur river basin jia et al 2020 it has been reported that more than 279 rivers in china flooded with higher flow stages than the warning water level in 2019 and direct flooding losses totaled cny 106 05 billion there were 35 26 million people were flooded 338 flood related deaths and 650 000 houses were destroyed in 2018 consequently analyzing the low frequency flooding characteristics including magnitude frequency and timing is urged to predict and manage future flooding events pre instrumental data from historical documents or geological archives e g lake sediments and fluvial deposits are of great significance to reconstruct low frequency flooding over centennial to millennia timescales furthermore reconstructions of palaeofloods using slackwater deposits were conducted in east asia including japan grossman 2001 ishii et al 2017 south korea kim et al 2017 and mongolia kim and tanaka 2017 fluvial low frequency flooding deposits provide long lasting evidence of peak water levels and typically consist of silt textured depositional layers within vertical sedimentary sequences preserved on the front terraces of the yellow river huang et al 2012 li and huang 2017 li et al 2019 long term flooding datasets incorporated by low frequency flooding events can reveal flooding cluster episodes and climate abrupt variations a long term flooding discharge frequency relation can help to improve our assessment of modern flood risks and regional climate changes the fenhe river one of the major tributaries of the yellow river the main source of water in shanxi province and a key river for understanding long term evolution of chinese civilization was selected as a case study fig 1 a its basin is a region where industry and population are widely distributed and it generates 46 of the gross industrial output and is home to 41 of the entire province s population li et al 2015 the per capita water resources in shanxi province amount to 381 m3 which is less than 20 of china nationally and it is the worst affected province in china sun et al 2013 given that increases in water consumption and overexploitation are threatening the basin s water supplies it is imperative to document a local quantitative long term flooding sequence so that a more accurate and reliable magnitude and frequency of flooding is recorded this will enable water conservation projects to be designed for the purpose of floodrisk assessment and reclamation in the fenhe river basin according to historical records and observations there were 150 major flooding events peak discharge 100 m3 s from 1951 to 2008 in the fenhe river basin fig 1b especially the middle and downstream sections which were flooded almost every two years in the basin the designed river conservation systems refer to flood discharges occurring every 20 or 100 years however recorded data on flooding events are too recent locally they only began during the 1950 s and do not reveal actual trends in flooding on millennial and centennial timescales baker 1987 benito et al 2015 consequently only a few decades of observed records are available limiting our ability to understand the characteristics of low frequency flooding events and long term variations liu et al 2015 till now there has been no hydrological reconstruction focused on long term low frequency flooding in the fenhe river hence event stratigraphies are necessary to obtain the quantitative datasets of long term flooding events such as water level discharge and velocity in order to further reveal long term flooding cluster episodes and climate abrupt variations clarify the relationship between regional hydro climatic deterioration and prehistoric cultural decline we have carried out extensive field investigations on event stratigraphies along the fenhe river in this study we focus on 1 explain the connection between sedimentary characteristics and environmental dynamics of lfds 2 reconstruct the magnitude and frequency of low frequency flooding events and 3 understand the historical impact of low frequency flooding events on local human settlements thus this case study shedding new light on the quantitative relationship between event stratigraphy and magnitude of the low frequency flooding on the fenhe river and its response to climate abrupt variations 2 case study area the fenhe river which is the second largest tributary of the yellow river has its source in the guanqin mountains at 1670 m a s l and after 695 km flows into the yellow river fig 1a it has many tributaries with a sinuosity of 1 68 and is characterized by a dendritic hydrometric network li et al 2015 located in the eastern loess plateau region its basin has a drainage area of 39 471 km2 and average gradient of 1 11 in the middle reaches of the yellow river in central china yang et al 2018 it has a temperate monsoonal climate typified by large seasonal amplitudes in temperature and precipitation the mean temperature is about 9 and average annual precipitation is about 504 mm in the basin sun et al 2013 li et al 2015 due to the influence of the east asian summer monsoon easm 84 7 of the major flooding along the fenhe river occurs from june to september this event is triggered by local short duration heavy rainstorms that account for almost 80 of the total annual rainfall during the rainy season fig 1b zhaocheng gauging station 36 23 n 111 40 e was originally built in 1951 on the middle reaches of the fenhe river to ascertain hydrological telemetry from 1951 to 2008 a total of fifty eight maximum annual peak discharge data was gathered from this gauging station two documented floods occurred at the station in 1843 and 1917 with peak discharges of 5450 m3 s and 3740 m3 s respectively as one of the birthplaces of chinese civilization numerous archaeological sites distributed throughout the fenhe river basin were dated to the late longshan culture 4400 4000 a bp and xia shang periods 4000 3100 a bp li et al 2017a the taosi site 4300 3900 a bp which is located at a higher elevation on the terrace 600 m a s l of the fenhe river is the largest settlement in the middle yellow river valley it represents the origins of chinese civilization li et al 2014 3 methods 3 1 field work detailed post event field investigations of low frequency flooding marks and hydrological parameter measurements of channel cross sections were undertaken along the course of the fenhe river the well preserved profile consisting of low frequency flooding deposits hereafter lfds and providing evidence for low frequency flooding reconstructions came from the xucun fhxc site 36 36 56 n 111 40 05 e located at linghuo canyon in the middle reaches of the fenhe river fig 1c d two alluvial terraces were observed along the river valley the first terrace t1 is 8 10 m and the second terrace t2 is 16 24 m above the fenhe river s normal water level the fhxc profile with a top elevation of 573 m a s l situated at the front of the second terrace t2 on the west bank is approximately 22 m above the normal water level xucun village began during the xia dynasty 2070 1600 bce and according to the archaeological discoveries served as a ferry point for transporting passengers and goods li et al 2014 in total fifty samples were collected at 5 cm intervals in situ for sedimentary analysis three optically stimulated luminescence osl samples of flooding event stratigraphy were obtained from the fhxc profile to determine the chronology moreover the quartzite sandstone bedrock channel which represents relative stability was suitable for hydrological calculations as attempted by this study 3 2 sedimentological and geochemical analysis for more details concerning characteristics transportation processes and sedimentary environment of the lfds in the middle reaches of the fenhe river multi proxy indexes of all fifty samples including the geochemical distribution of elements gde magnetic susceptibility x and particle size distribution psd were measured at the shaanxi normal university geochemical analysis of trace elements were measured using a panalytical pw2403 x ray fluorescence spectrometer guo et al 2014 duplicate samples blank samples and standard reference samples gss 1 and gsd 12 were all implemented to control the quality of the experimental work both low frequency xlf 470 hz and high frequency xhf 4700 hz magnetic susceptibilities were detected when using a bartington ms2 meter particle size distributions psd of samples were determined using a malven mastersizer s laser analyzer with 100 bins ranging from 0 02 to 2000 μm following the removal of secondary carbonates and organic matter with hcl 10 and h2o2 30 and adding a dispersant of napo3 6 friedman et al 1992 the parameters were calculated statistically with folk and ward s 1957 method determining the color of stratigraphic sequences meant referring to the munsell color chart 3 3 osl dating the chronology of low frequency flooding events was understood using the osl dating program in the tl osl dating laboratory at shaanxi normal university the osl measurements of 90 125 μm grain fraction were done using a risø tl osl da 20 reader equipped with a 90sr 90y beta source delivering 0 081 gy s and an infrared laser diode 830 nm 145 mw cm2 the reader simulated the quartz particles with blue light 470 30 nm 50 mw cm2 leds grün 2003 guo et al 2018 knight and evans 2018 for all samples the uranium u thorium th and potassium k content was tested by the neutron activation analysis naa method at the china institute of atomic energy beijing the gravimetric water content was equal to the ratio of the mass of water to the mass of samples after drying in an oven the equivalent dose de was determined using the single aliquot regenerative sar protocol murray and wintle 2000 all of the pretreatments and measurements were conducted in the osl tl dating laboratory shaanxi normal university 3 4 magnitude reconstructions the core of the experimental strategy in this study consisted of reconstructing the flooding peak stage and quantizations of the peak discharge in bedrock canyons rivers have slackwater environments at the time of the flooding peak stages appear and the flooding could be regarded as a stationarity flow peak stages of the low frequency flooding were estimated using the slackwater flow method guo et al 2017 each peak stage ps is summed from the bottom elevation be of end point lfds and the slackwater depth sd the slackwater depth sd is calculated by the ratio of the lfd thickness t to the bulk of suspended sediment load ssl of the flood p which is the ratio of the volume of ssl in floodwater to the volume of floodwater as a result the ps was inferred from the following equations 1 ps b e s d 2 sd t p 1 where p was inferred from the ratio of the suspended sediment concentration in floodwater at the cross section to the specific weight of ssl i e 2650 kg m3 the value of p in palaeoflood can often be insteaded by that of the ssl in the modern large flood guo et al 2017 according to the maximum ssl of 770 kg m3 which was observed at the zhaocheng gauging station cross section fig 1b in the middle fenhe river during the large flood that occurred on may 10 1969 the parameter p estimation is about 29 the peak discharge of the low frequency flooding was simulated employing the slope area method sam the most commonly utilized method in palaeoflood hydrology li and huang 2017 this method is based on manning s equation 3 q p n 1 a r 2 3 s 1 2 where qp is the peak discharge of the flooding flow a is the cross sectional area of the flow at the flooding stage n is the roughness coefficient of the stream bed r is the hydraulic radius which is the ratio of the cross sectional area a of the stream to its wetted perimeter and s is the channel slope gordon et al 2004 the manning s roughness coefficient n was obtained from the equation as follows 4 n n l n m n r 3 where roughness values with suffixes of m l and r indicate the main channel and flood channel to the left and right of the river respectively roughness values n were assigned based on the fenhe river s channel properties and by referring to the hydrological calculation norms for hydraulic engineering in china the river channel geometry and slope in the middle reaches were measured at the fhxc site using an electronic distance measurer and a gps in association with large scale contour maps 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of lfds stratigraphy stratigraphic sequences are well exposed and demarcations are clearly differentiated in the fhxc profile fig 1d a typical flooding sediment unit representing a phase of frequent extreme flooding is intercalated into the mid holocene palaeosol s0 in this profile and divides the s0 into two parts s01 and s02 specific stratigraphic classifications and systematic descriptions of the fhxc profile are presented in table 1 field evidence made it possible to characterize the deposits created by the low frequency flooding event as composed of dull yellow orange parallel or waving beddings and moderately to well sorted strata table 1 due to sedimentary features namely munsell color texture and structure the flooding unit wasfurther subdivided into four sub layers lfd1 1 lfd1 2 lfd1 3 and lfd1 4 these records suggest that each sub layer s sedimentation represents an individual flooding event and the key to how much hydrodynamic force was evident to carry out source identification effectively it is necessary to analyze the distribution of trace elements in each stratigraphic sequence of the fhxc these analyses help us to fully understand the geochemical characteristics of the fenhe river flooding sediments and variations in regional climate also the geochemical baseline values of elements in the parent materials represent the background levels of elements in the sediments of the study area the cr v ni co cu zn rb mn pb and sr content in the fhxc profile were in the following respective ranges 63 3 77 1 79 5 101 9 28 7 35 1 12 3 19 2 22 8 30 6 63 9 78 4 83 7 106 6 572 4 717 8 19 9 25 3 and 195 3 230 2 ppm trace elements geochemical distributions of stratigraphic sequences further confirmed our stratigraphic subdivisions in the fhxc profile the geochemical concentrations of the tested elements in ts l0 and s01 layers were much larger than the relevant background values of the elements in l1 meaning that the trace metals accumulated in l0 and s01 had resulted from weathering and pedogenic modification processes especially s01 was fully matured during the warmest and wettest holocene climatic optimum with intensivepedogenesis in favor of trace elements accumulations huang et al 2012 another interesting point is that ts in the surface was disturbed by anthropogenic activities such as mineral exploiting and metal smelting in the fenhe river basin since 1500 however variations in the tested trace elements content in the lfds layers appeared to rapidly decrease between s01 and s02 which were formed in the mid holocene fig 2 the mean concentrations of cr v ni co cu zn rb mn pb and sr in the lfds were in the 65 1 84 6 29 8 13 4 24 1 65 4 93 8 613 8 21 0 and 211 6 ppm ranges respectively the amounts of ten trace elements in lfds were all smaller than those of the parent materials l1 malan loess at the bottom of the fhxc profile suggesting that the lfds had undergone long distance transportation by flooding flows it also indicated that their origins were formed differently from the parent materials a major sink for trace elements suggests that the lfds underwent a series of physicochemical changes such as reduction reaction leaching and migration in the process of flooding inundation remarkable peaks present at the boundary between the top of the flood deposit lfd1 4 and bottom of the s01 at about 125 cm depth suggests that lfds were not affected by weathering and pedogenesis but the higher location of the deposition during high flooding stage represents the more powerful uplift force of flooding in the internal hydrodynamics scenario li et al 2019 results enable a differentiation of the lfds from loess and palaeosols also show that some climate abnormalities existed with extreme flooding in the mid holocene at the study site magnetic susceptibility x was successfully used to identify flooding deposits from loess and palaeosol sequences in the yellow river basin huang et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 the trend variations of xlf and xhf curves in the fhxc profile are consistent the xlf values of lfd samples in the fhxc profile vary from 37 8 to 42 1 10 8 m3 kg with an average value of 39 6 10 8 m3 kg and this is lower than the mean values of eolian loess l0 and l1 44 7 and 41 4 10 8 m3 kg and the mean values of mid holocene palaeosol s01 and s02 43 3 and 42 8 10 8 m3 kg in a flooded environment the magnetite usually presents selective dissolution which leads to xlf values of lfd samples being low the differences in magnetic susceptibility of the fhxc profile indicate that the lfds formed during or shortly after flood peak recession without experiencing weathering and pedogenesis furthermore their traits depend on the suspended sediments being carried by flooding flows 4 2 sedimentary environment of lfds particle size analysis provides a more precise identification and characterization of the flooding sediments and their depositional setting huang et al 2017 the particle size parameters reveal depositional process hydrodynamic conditions and transportation mechanism in this stretch of the river the psd curves in fig 3 reveal that the amounts of coarse silt 16 63 μm in the lfds are higher than those of aeolian deposits including ts l0 l1 lt and s0 in the fhxc profile and the typical loess the amount of 42 8 in this region li et al 2013 in contrast the amount of fine silt 2 16 μm are smaller than those of aeolian deposits in the fhxc profile and the typical loess the amounts of 47 6 in this region li et al 2013 thus the lfds are dominated by coarse silt the amounts of fine sand 63 125 μm and sand 100 μm in the lfds are lower than those of aeolian deposits including l1 lt and s0 but they all are less than 10 in the profile it means that the lfds and aeolian deposits were delivered by different driving forces one is northwest wind the other is flood the frequency curves of psd in the palaeosol s01 and s02 and loess l0 l1 and lt exhibit two peak values 6 12 μm and 35 55 μm but the lfds curves in the fhxc profile present a single peak value 25 45 μm fig 4 a the particle size cumulative frequency curves show that aeolian deposits loess and palaeosol are dominated by fine silt while the lfds are mainly composed of coarse silt in the fhxc profile fig 4b median particle size md values of lfds ranging from 17 99 μm to 21 12 μm and their mean particle size mz values ranging from 22 62 μm to 24 63 μm are higher than those of other stratigraphic sequences in the fhxc profile the combination of psd frequency curves md and mz indexes means that these lfds are dominated by coarse grained sediments confirming that high energy sedimentation had occurred in this lfds unit furthermore the triangular diagram of psd demonstrates that all the lfds layers in the fhxc profile are clayey silt in nature and different from loess and palaeosols fig 4c the proportions of clay in the deposits reflect the link between finer composite particles in stagnant flooding with low velocities particle size probability cumulative curves illustrate that the lfds were deposited mainly from suspension load fraction transported by the flooding with an average proportion of about 72 while saltation population accounted for 27 fig 4d sorting σ values between 1 48 and 1 77 mean that the lfds are well sorted the sharpness or peakedness of the particle size frequency curve and the degree of symmetry of particle size distribution are measured by the kurtosis kg of 1 01 and skewness sk of 0 30 respectively these particle size parameters show that lfds are mostly coarse silt well sorted coarse skewed and leptokurtic this consequently indicates that the lfds were carried in suspension during high energy extreme flooding currents characterized by firstly a high water level and secondly the river having a relatively stagnant environment 4 3 magnitudes of low frequency flooding events in situ reconstruction of flooding magnitudes based on geological archives can provide a real long term record li et al 2019 the bottom elevations of lfds at the fhxc site ranged from 572 18 to 572 33 m a s l based on the slackwater flow depth method i e eqs 1 and 2 palaeoflood depths of four lfds layers were between 22 35 and 22 50 m thus peak stages of well documented lfds at the study site varied from 572 35 and 572 50 m a s l table 2 the river channel geometry in relation to the cross section i i is presented in fig 1c and fig 5 a b the river reach at the fhxc site lies in a narrow and deep bedrock valley and the channel bottom is relatively stable resulting in a single channel system with bedrock protrusions the bedrock confined channel geometry at the maximum stage is known or can be approximated because no major changes can be assumed to have occurred throughout the holocene liu et al 2015 li and huang 2017 based on contour maps and field measurement the average channel slope is 1 11 in this river stretch the channel was characterized by a straight bank some pools and shoals clean lower stages more ineffective slopes and sections stony sections which points to the roughness coefficient n is 0 040 at the study site based on the peak stages the maximum peak discharges of lfds were estimated to be 13 480 13 590 m3 s according to the sam method i e eq 3 at the fhxc site table 2 these reconstructed palaeoflood peak discharges are larger than twice the maximum systematic gauged record of 2800 m3 s july 25th 1957 at the zhaocheng gauging station on the fenhe river as already found in previous studies reconstructed palaeoflood peak discharges are higher than 2 5 3 0 times the maximum documented flooding data on the jinghe river beiluohe river and yellow river huang et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 guo et al 2017 li et al 2019 these reconstructed palaeoflood results agree wellwith the relationship between peak discharges and drainage areas of global maximum flooding events expressed by the equation q 21d0 73 fig 5c and established by baker 2006 the curves offer further convincing support to the conclusion that reconstructions of low frequency discharges are reliable in the stable bedrock reaches of the fenhe river 4 4 timing of low frequency flooding events a reliable chronology of each event stratigraphy was established by the osl dating and stratigraphic correlations with other existing well dated jh ygz huang et al 2012 blh chz profiles zhang et al 2015 in the middle reaches of the yellow river fig 1a stratigraphic correlations witnessed that event stratigraphies of low frequency flooding in the fhxc profile were mainly formed in the mid holocene fig 6 three samples of lfds in the fhxc profile were dated to 4190 580 a 4020 450 a and 3910 580 a respectively table 3 these osl dates suggest that these low frequency flooding events took place during 4200 3900 a bp which is defined the beginning of the current meghalayan age in the holocene epoch the interval was contemporaneous with the transition fromthe late longshan culture 4400 4000 a bp to xia shang periods 4000 3100 a bp corresponding to the taosi culture period in the fenhe river basin three luminescence ages of the fhxc profile also demonstrate an increase in age with depth table 3 reflecting the lfds deposition over time under stable sedimentary environmental conditions especially during the interval of climatic deterioration at 4200 3900 a bp settlers responded to the abrupt climatic events that coincided with extreme flooding by leaving the plains that susceptible to flooding for the plateaus hills and mountains with high elevations in the fenhe river basin timmermann and friedrich 2016 li et al 2017a in fact the taosi site located on the terrace with an elevation of 600 m a s l was ca 40 m higher than the water level of the fenhe river that was further confirmed the overbank flooding occurred frequently during the period fig 5d furthermore episodes of social destabilization wars and dynastic cycles in china were more frequent during the interval hosner et al 2016 wang et al 2016 some other prominent low frequency flooding records at 3900 4200 a bp of the climatic transitional period were found on the yellow river and its other tributaries fig 6 such as the jinghe river huang et al 2012 and beiluohe river zhang et al 2015 also it was reported that two extreme flooding events occurred at 4900 4600 a bp and 4100 3800 a bp in the middle yangtze river that have accelerated the decline of the shijiahe culture 4100 3800 a bp wu et al 2017 as well the cooling arid climatic event at 4200 a bp was well documented by a stalagmite from dongge cave wang et al 2005 the late neolithic cultures such as the qijia culture in the upper yellow river and the laohushan culture in southern inner mongolia in china terminated abruptly at 4000 a bp dong et al 2013 wang et al 2016 in these cases the remarkable climatic shift involving a sharp increase in occurrences of drought cooling arid conditions or high magnitude low frequency flooding played an important role in the transition of neolithic bronze cultures throughout china consequently the ancient settlement migrations and devastation of the taosi culture in the fenhe river basin mainly resulted from the regional dramatic climate fluctuations a finding that is consistent with frequent extreme flooding events li et al 2014 li et al 2017a in addition pollen percentages from dali lake wen et al 2017 and gonghai lake chen et al 2015 and the stalagmite oxygen isotope values from theshang cave wang et al 2018 all of which are located in the domain of the east asian summer monsoon suggested that the monsoon precipitation fluctuated but with an overall decreasing trend in northern and central china during the period of 4200 3900 a bp corresponding to the 4200 a bp cooling climatic event worldwide caused by the weaker east asia summer monsoon li et al 2015 as well as relatively strong el niño southern oscillation enso activities zhu et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 again it indicated that extreme floods triggered by heavy rainstorms occurred in the study region accompanied by frequent droughts during the 4200 a bp event 4 5 frequency of long term flooding events the log pearson type iii lp iii distribution method is extensively used for flooding frequency estimation of non continuous data series including extreme values schendel and thongwichian 2017 solari et al 2017 burn and whitfield 2018 a statistical analysis of reconstructed low frequency flooding historical flooding and observed annual flooding series afs 1951 2008 at the zhaocheng station was performed by fitting a lp iii distribution fig 7 a regional long term flooding frequency curve built as a red line in fig 7 reveals that frequencies of reconstructed palaeoflood peak discharges were 0 01 in the lower quantile of the curve as a result the reconstructed peak discharge of 13 590 m3 s corresponds to a large return period lasting 10 000 years table 4 the discharges for 1000 and 100 year flooding events were 10 600 m3 s and 4550 m3 s respectively statistics show that 78 6 of extreme floods were caused by large scale rainstorms in the basin and the flood hydrograph was characterized by a rapid rise and mitigatory recession shanxi province department of water resources 2014 such as a severe flood of the wuding river occurred in 2017 and its peak stage rose nearly 20 m in suide county yao et al 2018 5 conclusions in the case study low frequency flooding events that occurred on the middle fenhe river during 4200 3900 a bp were identified based on event stratigraphy multi proxy indexed were applied to reveal that lfds were well sorted clayey silt in nature and carried in suspension during high energy extreme flooding currents with a high water level and the river having a relatively stagnant environment combining the slackwater flow depths inferred by the thicknesses of lfds magnitudes of low frequency flooding at the studied site were reconstructed to be 13 480 13 590 m3 s with peak stages varying from 572 35 and 572 50 m a s l at the study site the results were larger than twice of the maximum systematic gauged record of 2800 m3 s and the peak discharges drainage area relationship for the fenhe river basin could be expressed as q 21d0 73 coupling with real low frequency flooding data a regional long term magnitude frequency curve was obtained which improved the precise of flood risk assessment and prediction future low frequency flooding events in the basin the high magnitude low frequency flooding events were highly sensitive to regional monsoonal climatic variability in the holocene a flooding clusters episode at 4200 3900 a bp is comparable with the ancient settlement migrations and devastation of the taosi culture in the fenhe river basin moreover synchronous high magnitude low frequency flooding on the yellow river and yangtze river played an important role in the transition of neolithic bronze age in china these findings potentially contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between prehistoric cultural decline and regional hydro climatic deterioration credit authorship contribution statement yuqin li conceptualization methodology investigation writing

3928,non stationarity due to climate change and or variability can reduce the capabilities of drought prediction models the objective of this study is to improve drought prediction by eliminating non stationarity from temperature time series a key factor in development and propagation of droughts in a changing climate in order to relax the assumption of stationarity an ensemble stationary based support vector regression essvr method was developed and compared with the traditional support vector regression svr three types of drought indices in three time scales monthly seasonal and semiannual including multivariate bivariate standardized drought indices and univariate standardized drought indices were used as the target variables in an application to the red river of the north basin rrb the north american land data assimilation system nldas data from 1979 to 2016 were used for the training and testing of the prediction model the pearson correlation root mean square error rmse and taylor diagram were used to evaluate the performances of the essvr remarkably the distribution of identified change points varies by climate divisions the results of the svr and essvr in the rrb were compared demonstrating the better performances of the essvr for most of the drought indices particularly those with higher sensitivity to temperature it was found that the extreme high and low values of hyperparameters mostly assigned by svr cause a higher risk of overfitting for svr in contrast essvr improves the drought prediction by removing the non stationarity thus providing more accurate drought predictions especially for a warming climate keywords drought prediction support vector regression nonstationary time series climate change change point detection tuning hyperparameters 1 introduction drought prediction is crucial for water resource management despite a large amount of literature there are still fundamental limitations in drought prediction models wood et al 2015 natural or anthropogenic changes in climatic hydrologic and or landscape processes cause non stationary conditions in time series of hydroclimatic variables ryberg et al 2020 jehanzaib et al 2020 and hence pose a challenge for reliable drought prediction hao et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 dutta and maity 2021 non stationarity of time series and change points points in a time series where the statistical properties change killick et al 2012 can cause violation of critical assumptions in drought prediction the 2012 drought which hit the upper great plains in the u s is one of the droughts that was not captured by the existing drought prediction models due to warming climate and non stationary time series hoerling et al 2014 thus the performances of drought prediction models may not be satisfactory unless the changes in climate are captured from historical records hao et al 2018 brunner et al 2021 therefore it is critical to consider non stationarity in drought prediction models ju et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2018 data driven statistical drought prediction models have the advantages of minimum data requirement and rapid development over dynamic models adamowski 2008 artificial neural network ann and support vector regression svr vapnik 1995 are among the well known drought prediction models ganguli and reddy 2014 yu et al 2006 to avoid the non stationarity problem in data driven drought prediction models various methodologies have been proposed for example decomposition methods e g wavelet transformation have been used extensively for drought prediction maity et al 2016 ozger et al 2011 wavelet ann deo et al 2017 kim and valdés 2003 wavelet svr belayneh et al 2014 and wavelet based hybrid ann arima khan et al 2020 are among these improved drought prediction models there are some studies investigating the impacts of non stationarity in svr in other fields for example dynamic support vector machines dsvms were proposed to model non stationary time series cao and gu 2002 to deal with the structural changes in the data the dsvms used an exponentially increasing regularization constant and an exponentially decreasing tube size instead of fixed values of the regularization constant and the tube size for all training data points cao and gu 2002 fan and tang 2013 decomposed the non stationary time series with monotonic trend items into a finite and often small number of intrinsic mode functions and a monotone residual trend item by the empirical mode decomposition emd and then applied the svr on each subset of data and finally integrated the results grinblat et al 2015 introduced a time adaptive support vector regression ta svr to improve prediction a novel regressor as twin svr was proposed by peng 2010 three different methods of transformation namely relative difference in percentages z score and natural logarithm transformations were applied to the data series ojemakinde 2006 in these studies better results were obtained after accounting for the non stationarity in time series change point detection techniques also can be used for drought analysis to overcome the non stationarity problem in data driven models change point analysis is an active area in statistics and an area of great interest in hydrology ryberg et al 2020 tavakol et al 2020 employed the mann kendall and pettitt tests to identify change points and nonstationary conditions of temperature indices for the missouri river basin ryberg et al 2020 conducted a study to detect change points of annual peak streamflow in the united states huang et al 2016 employed the heuristic segmentation method pedro et al 2001 to detect the changing points of annual streamflow time series from 1960 to 2012 in the columbia river basin jehanzaib et al 2020 investigated the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological drought by developing non stationary approaches significant decreases in precipitation and streamflow were observed after considering change points duggins et al 2010 developed a new method based on the empirical transition matrix generated by the standardized precipitation index spi for identification of change point s in the time series mazdiyansi and aghakouchak 2015 employed the cramer von mises change point detection method and found a significant shift in the distributions of droughts across the contiguous u s change point detection methods have been increasingly used in drought studies to overcome the aforementioned non stationarity problem ju et al 2021 achour et al 2020 in this study a change point detection technique is specifically coupled with the widely used svr to improve its performance for drought prediction the objective of this research is to improve the prediction of droughts in a changing climate by developing a new ensemble stationary based support vector regression essvr method correspondingly a new drought identification categorization and prediction dic predict system is developed for drought analyses to highlight the importance of snow drought in the warming climate dic predict is tested in a cold climate region in which snow snowmelt and snow accumulation are critical in drought identification especially in a warming climate this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology algorithm and framework of the essvr model and the evaluation of essvr section 3 provides the results of essvr and traditional svr and their comparisons while section 4 discusses the results finally section 5 summarizes the conclusions and findings from this study 2 methodology the non stationarity issue in the traditional svr model reduces the capability of svr in prediction of droughts in a warming climate using a change point detection technique helps to identify where the changes in statistical properties of a temperature time series occur thus the dataset can be split into a set of stationery datasets based on the identified change points applying svr on each stationary dataset and implementing a weighting approach to ensemble the prediction results from all stationary svr models improve drought prediction 2 1 essvr model fig 1 shows the flowchart for the essvr method prior to applying the proposed methodology two tests are conducted to examine the stationarity non stationarity of the temperature time series specifically augmented dickey fuller adf dickey and fuller 1979 and kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss kwiatkowski et al 1992 tests are used in this study if the non stationarity of the time series is confirmed by these tests a fast approximate window based change point detection method window sliding truong et al 2020 is used to split the nonstationary time series into multiple stationary time series svr is further conducted on each stationary subset of the training data an initial weight is assigned to the predicted values by svr on each subset of data and it is updated by comparison with the actual values and higher weights assigned to those with higher accuracy finally the prediction with the higher weight is selected as the final prediction for a temperature time series of t 1 j t 2 j t m j if the regime switches at month τ for grid j change point then t 1 j t τ j differ from t τ 1 j t m j in some statistical properties for example the means differ in series

change points in the temperature time series in the window sliding algorithm the discrepancies d between two adjacent windows that slide along the dataset are computed for a given cost function c the discrepancy between two subsets is given by truong et al 2020 2 d t a i t i b c t a b c t a i c t i b where c is a cost loss or error function for a given segment a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the sliding window once the computation of all discrepancies for all windows is completed a peak search procedure is performed to find the major change points truong et al 2020 fig 2 shows the svr model a with and b without assumption of stationarity the changing tube size instead of a fixed tube size in all the training data points is crucial to relax the assumption of stationarity in a prediction model the change point detection is used to identify the changes in the tube size and the corresponding hyperparameters in the svr if l change points are detected in the temperature time series the dataset is divided into l time series and svr is performed on each time series by removing the impacts of change points each time series is turned to l stationary time series the svr is a general regression model based on the relationship between predictor s x i j l and predictand i e drought indices di i j l f x i j l a nonlinear function is estimated as f x i j l by sum of a set of kernel functions the purpose of using the kernel function here is to transform the space from nonlinear to linear for input vector x i j l 3 di i j l f x i j l e j l where e j l is the error and f x i j l is estimated by vapnik 1995 4 f x i j l w j l x i j l b j l where w j l indicates the support vector weights basis functions and b j l is a bias term similar to the intercept in linear regression for each stationary time series in each grid the angle brackets represent a dot product the following regularized risk function needs to minimize the complexity i e the magnitude of w j l to estimate f x i j l during the training vapnik 1995 5 min 1 2 w j l 2 c j l i 1 n ξ i j l ξ i j l based on the ε insensetive approach the regularized risk function is subject to vapnik 1995 6 f x i j l w j l x

with an error more than ε j l are penalized in construction of the predictor f x i j l errors will be tolerated to the degree of ε j l this optimization problem is solved by lagrange multipliers using scikit learn package pedregosa et al 2011 2 2 tuning hyperparameters in cross validation of svr the hyperparameters in an svr model play a key role in the performance of a prediction model therefore the spatial distributions of cost value c epsilon ε and gamma g are compared in svr and essvr c ε and g values affect the model complexity in different ways parameter c determines the tradeoff between the model complexity flatness and the training error joachims 2002 which is the degree to which deviations larger than ε are tolerated in the optimization formulation for example if c is too large infinity the objective is to minimize the empirical risk only without considering the model complexity in the optimization formulation a small value of c increases the training errors while a large c leads to a behavior similar to that of a hard margin svm joachims 2002 the margin is defined as the minimum distance from the decision boundary to the training points and a hard margin svm makes the svm overly sensitive to any noise in the data parameter ε controls the width of the ε insensitive zone used to fit the training data the value of ε has an effect on the smoothness of the svr s response and can affect the support vectors used to construct the regression function the bigger ε is the fewer support vectors are selected on the other hand bigger ε values result in more flat estimates if ε is greater than the range of the target values good result cannot be obtained schölkopf and smola 2002 on the other hand if ε is equal to zero overfitting occurs the optimal value of ε varies linearly with g variance of the gaussian noise schölkopf and smola 2002 which is a kernel parameter that reduces the model space and controls the complexity of the solution kisi and cimen 2011 cherkassky and mulier 1998 suggested the use of cross validation for the svm parameter choice a gird search cross validation approach is used for selection of the best hyperparameters in each stationary dataset fig 3 shows the cross validation in the traditional svr and essvr the hyperparameters are tuned by splitting the training data into several stationary subsets and the cross validation is performed on each subset for each subset the drought index is predicted for the same testing period the prediction that is closer to the actual values based on rmse is selected as the final prediction an ensemble technique is developed and employed on the outputs of essvr on stationary subsets of data di i j l this selective ensemble is developed as due to the variability or change in climate each subset of training data with different statistical properties identified and split by the change point techniques can potentially have different prediction results for a specific period the predicted values closer to the actual values are selected as the final prediction result the following algorithm is used for this selective ensemble technique on the results of the svr on each subset for l 1 2 l 1a initialize w 1 w 2 w l 1 l 1b draw a stationary subset s l from the training data for time step i 1 2 n 2a train regressor f l on s l 2b estimate the risk of f l according to the probability of discrepancy between the predicted and actual values p 1 p 2 p n 9 r l i 1 n p i di i f l x i 2c update w l w l 1 1 r l select the prediction with the highest weight which has the lowest risk 2 3 assessment of essvr root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 are used to compare the overall areal average performances of essvr and the traditional svr hereafter svr then a taylor diagram taylor 2001 for the grid with the largest difference between rmse values in essvr and svr is created to compare the performance of these two models to overcome the challenge in selecting the best performance measures the taylor diagram is commonly used in climate and environment studies to facilitate comparative assessment of different models it is used to quantify the degree of correspondence and correlation between the predicted and actual values in terms of three performance measures the pearson correlation coefficient the root mean square error rmse and the standard deviation the azimuthal angle depicts the pearson correlation coefficient the centered rmse in the predicted values is proportional to the distance from the actual values on the x axis the standard deviation of the predicted pattern is proportional to the radial distance from the origin 2 4 setup of essvr model to address different types of drought three types of drought indices in different time scales monthly seasonal and semiannual are used to set up the essvr model the target variables consist of multivariate hydroclimatic aggregate drought index hadi bazrkar et al 2020 and snow based hydroclimatic aggregate drought index shadi bazrkar and chu 2021 bivariate standardized drought indices based on the difference between precipitation and actual evapotranspiration spei and the summation of snowmelt and rainfall and univariate standardized drought indices based on precipitation surface runoff baseflow soil moisture snowpack and snow water equivalent standardized precipitation index spi standardized runoff index sri standardized baseflow index sbfi bazrkar and chu 2020 standardized soil moisture index ssi xu et al 2018 standardized snowpack index sspi and standardized snow water equivalent index sswei huning and aghakouchak 2018 are calculated by using the same method as the one by farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 by applying gringorten plotting position for each dataset and then standardizing the cumulative distribution function cdf the same method is applied on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration dfct and the summation of snowmelt and rainfall to calculate spei and standardized snowmelt and rain index smri staudinger et al 2014 respectively hadi is calculated by standardizing the first principal component in the principal component analysis pca on rainfall snowmelt surface runoff and soil moisture while shadi is computed by using precipitation and snowpack instead of rainfall and snowmelt to account for snow drought depending on the specific drought index that is used as the target variable in the prediction model different types of predictor s are used table 1 shows the predictands and their associated predictors precipitation p is used as a predictor for prediction of all drought indices temperature t is also used for prediction of spei smri sspi and sswei in addition actual evapotranspiration et and dfct are added in the prediction of hadi shadi ssi sri and sbfi the training and testing periods range from 1979 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2016 respectively the input data for calculation of the drought indices and drought prediction are obtained from the north american land data assimilation system nldas mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012 the goal of the nldas is to construct quality controlled and spatially and temporally consistent land surface model lsm datasets from the best available observations and model output to support modeling activities the nldas products are used in modeling research and applications such as drought and flood monitoring watershed and water quality management and case studies of extreme events there are two phases referred to as nldas 1 and nldas 2 the latter which spans january 1979 present is used in this study nldas integrates a large quantity of observation based and model reanalyzed data at 1 8th degree grid spacing over central north america mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012 2 5 study area the red river of the north basin rrb fig 4 a typical cold climate region in the northern great plain covers over 90 000 km2 in the u s part of rrb according to the noaa 2021 data the western part of the rrb is drier than the eastern part and the northern part is colder than the southern part the 100 year mean dataset fig 4 shows that the order of climate divisions cds from the driest to the wettest is as follows 3202 3205 3203 3206 3209 3903 2101 2104 and 2102 the same dataset also indicates the order of cds from the coldest to the warmest 2101 3203 3202 2101 3205 3206 3209 2104 and 3903 drought has significant impacts on the rrb since a great portion of the rrb is covered by cultivated croplands a variety of drought indices are used to test the essvr in the rrb in this study 3 results 3 1 results of change point detection the null hypothesis the time series is not stationary in the adf test failed to be rejected by a significance level of 5 for all grids the null hypothesis for the kpss test the time series is stationary is rejected by a significance level of 10 for all girds the spatial patterns of the first and the second identified change points on the monthly temperature time series are shown in fig 5 the numbers in the legend refer to time steps starting from january 1979 wherein 45 160 195 220 255 260 275 and 300 are related to september 1982 april 1992 march 1995 april 1997 march 2000 august 2000 november 2001 and december 2003 respectively the first change point is identified in august 2000 for a great portion of the area 45 in cds 3206 and 3209 and cd 2101 in the southern part in 28 of the rrb mostly in northeastern part of cd 2101 and that part of cd 2102 the first change points were identified in april 1997 grid 261 highlighted in fig 5 was one of these grids the temperature time series and the identified change points are shown in fig 5 the second change point for this grid is identified in november 2001 when 65 of the rrb cds 3206 3209 3903 2104 2101 and 2102 has the same second change point august 2000 was identified as the second change points in 23 of the rrb cd 3203 the average values of monthly temperature through the entire training period the period from january 1979 to the first change point and the period between the first and the second change points are 4 48 3 80 and 6 54 respectively there also are slight changes in the standard deviation values namely 12 63 12 86 and 11 64 were the standard deviations of the entire training period the period from january 1979 to the first change point and the period between the first and the second change points respectively 3 2 assessment of essvr by comparison with the traditional svr to measure the performance of essvr it is compared with svr without considering the non stationarity in the temperature times series the comparison of the performances of essvr and svr for the monthly indices is conducted based on the difference between the rmse of the results for svr and essvr figs 6 8 in these figures blue spots show the points with superiority of essvr and the red spots depict the points with inferiority of the essvr for spi and sri the blue spots are accumulated in cd 3203 the 3rd driest and the 2nd coldest cd in the rrb fig 6 the blue spots for ssi were mostly located in cd 2101 the 3rd wettest and the 4th coldest cd in the rrb fig 6 for sbfi cd 2102 the wettest and coldest region showed the superiority of essvr over svr due to the accumulation of the blue spots fig 6 for sspi sswei spei and hadi the blue spots were piled up in cd 3206 the 4th driest and the 4th warmest cd in the rrb figs 6 8 for shadi the blue spots were gathered in cds 3203 and 3202 fig 8 fig 9 shows the various ranges of the differences between the rmse values in svr and essvr for monthly seasonal and semi annual drought indices overall essvr for shadi had lower rmse values in 71 of the rrb which was the highest coverage among monthly drought indices 54 45 38 33 and 28 were the coverage percentages of superiority essvr over svr with the ranges of the differences of rmse higher than 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 respectively the monthly ssi and spei had the second largest area coverage 51 with lower rmse for essvr than that of svr among the seasonal indices sri had the highest area coverage for all ranges of the differences in the rmse values for essvr and svr except for the difference greater than 0 05 sbfi had the largest coverage for the difference greater 0 05 36 for sri 64 52 46 42 37 and 32 were the coverage percentages of superiority of essvr over svr with the range greater than 0 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 respectively like the monthly indices the largest coverage of superiority of essvr over svr was observed for the semi annual shadi for shadi 66 60 54 49 46 and 42 were the coverage percentages of superiority of essvr over svr with the range greater than 0 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 respectively generally the coverage percentage of superiority of essvr over svr increased by increasing the time scales of drought indices overall the monthly ssi spei and shadi and the seasonal sri ssi sbfi spei smri hadi and shadi and the semi annual ssi sbfi sspi sswei spei hadi and shadi were among the indices with more than 50 of the area showing better performances of essvr than svr 3 3 spatial distributions of hyperparameters in svr and essvr the spatial distributions of c epsilon ε and gamma g in svr and essvr were compared fig 10 considering shadi as the target variable shadi was selected since it had the largest coverage of the differences in rmse for svr and essvr fig 9 thus it can be helpful to investigate the reasons behind the superiority of essvr over svr the spatial patterns of c values were almost the same for svr and essvr and there was only a minor discrepancy the same percentage of rrb was assigned to the c values equal to 1 73 and 25 4 for both svr and essvr however a slightly higher percentage of the area was covered by c values of 15 4 and 20 2 in essvr comparing with 1 and 1 respectively in svr 14 and 6 of the rrb were covered by c values of 5 and 10 for svr however a slightly smaller percentage was assigned to the same values of c in essvr 12 and 5 overall the difference was not significant but it can be concluded that the smaller values of c were covered by a higher percentage of the rrb in svr and higher values of c such as 15 and 20 were assigned in a higher percentage of the rrb in essvr fig 10 shows a smaller area coverage 41 in essvr comparing with 46 in svr covered by ε equal to 1 a smaller coverage i e 5 for svr comparing with 4 for essvr is also assigned to ε of 0 001 however a larger coverage 36 was for a value of 0 1 for essvr comparing with 30 for svr similarly 9 coverage for 0 0001 and 10 coverage for 0 01 were observed for svr and essvr respectively ignoring the similar coverage for 0 0001 and 0 01 higher coverage percentages were assigned for the relatively high e g 1 and low values of ε e g 0 001 for svr significant differences between the coverages of g values in svr and essvr were observed for g equal to 0 1 and 5 80 of the rrb was covered by g equal to 0 1 i e the lowest g value in this study for essvr the corresponding percentage for svr was 60 however for the highest value of g equal to 5 a higher percentage 18 was covered for svr comparing with 5 for essvr thus essvr was inclined to the lower values of g according to schölkopf and smola 2002 g values are related to ε while higher values of c were assigned for essvr it inclined to assign lower values of g 3 4 grid based analysis of performances of essvr and svr finally the grid with the largest difference in rmse of svr and essvr for each drought index was identified and a taylor diagram was created to compare the performances of svr and essvr among the monthly drought indices fig 11 the highest improvement was observed for sri the rmse increased by 0 19 and r2 increased from 0 06 to 0 62 comparing essvr and svr the standard deviations of the predicted values by essvr were much closer to those of the observed values for the monthly sbfi both svr and essvr were out of range of the taylor diagram since their r2 values were negative the application of a seasonal time scale for sbfi caused no change fig 12 while there was a slight improvement in the results after a semi annual time scale was used fig 13 the results of svr for hadi and shadi were not acceptable based on the r2 values however the implication of essvr led to an improvement in the results almost the same results were observed for the seasonal and semi annual indices figs 12 and 13 for the seasonal indices minor differences existed for ssi where a negative correlation was observed for svr however the application of essvr led to an improvement in the results r2 increased from 0 61 to 0 39 and rmse had a decrease of 0 29 in rmse although a similar improvement was not observed after the application of the semi annual time scale for ssi for all other drought indices noticeable improvements in the results were observed for the semi annual indices fig 13 the top three highest decreases in rmse were for sri sbfi and shadi for sri r2 increased from 0 56 to 0 46 and rmse decreased by 0 45 for shadi and sbfi decreases by 0 46 and 0 43 in rmse were observed respectively despite a decrease in rmse of essvr the r2 values for both svr and essvr were negative and not in the range of the taylor diagram 4 discussion the results of the adf and kpss tests confirm that the temperature time series in all grids are non stationary thus the change point detection was conducted on the temperature time series there existed an agreement between the cds and the first change points the spatial pattern of the second change points can be divided into the northern and southern parts of the rrb the statistical properties of the temperature time series confirmed the accuracy of the identified change points and highlighted the necessity of considering the non stationarity for prediction of droughts in a warming climate various reasons such as natural and or anthropogenic changes in climatic hydrologic and or landscape processes can be accounted for the identified change points in the datasets however since the change point detection analysis is conducted on the temperature time series it can be concluded that the non stationarity and the identified change points on the time series of temperature a key hydroclimatic variable in warming climate can be attributed to climate change the identified change points can be regarded as a result of trend varying mean through time and or seasonality time dependent variance in both cases non stationarity is captured from the historical records and drought prediction is improved overall there are various reasons for the superiority of essvr over svr for each drought index since the predictor for spi is precipitation the impact of consideration of the non stationarity in the temperature time series is attributed to the separation of snowfall and rainfall in this cold climate region thus the superiority of essvr over svr in cold and dry climate for cd 3203 is related to the higher sensitivity of spi to temperature in a relatively colder and drier region shukla and wood 2008 suggested to use sri for the regions with prevalent snowmelt the impact of removing the non stationarity in temperature as one of the predictors of sri is reflected on the superiority of essvr in a relatively colder and snowmelt dominant region ssi and sbfi are related to soil moisture and baseflow respectively the superiority of essvr in the wetter and colder regions for these two indices is related to the effect of frozen ground and its relation to the soil moisture and baseflow in the rrb sspi sswei spei and hadi are more sensitive to temperature which can be the main reason for the superiority of essvr cds 3203 and 3209 the 4th wettest cd and the 3rd warmest cd in the rrb have the densest accumulation of blue spots for smri fig 7 based on the summation of rainfall and snowmelt using essvr in a warmer and wetter region is more beneficial since rainfall is dominant in such a region cd 3202 is the driest and the 3rd coldest cd in the rrb shadi has been primarily developed to identify snow drought by considering snowpack in its calculation the superiority of essvr in cds 3203 and 3202 which are among the top driest and coldest cds in this region is related to this feature of shadi overall the results suggested that 1 by increasing the time scales more drought indices showed better performances by considering the stationarity in essvr and 2 regardless of the time scale essvr outperformed svr when ssi sbfi and shadi were selected as the target variables since these indices are sensitive to temperature considering the relationships of soil moisture and baseflow to frozen ground in ssi and sbfi and snowpack in shadi consideration of the stationarity of the temperature as one of the predictors improved the drought prediction hyperparameters play key roles in the performances of svr and essvr models smaller c values in svr can increase the training errors while larger c values in essvr can lead to a hard margin svm and higher sensitivity in the data noises the better performance of essvr than svr can be related to the fact that larger ε values can lead to more flat estimates and smaller ε values can cause overfitting when larger values of c were assigned by essvr it inclined to assign smaller values of g this finding confirmed the results by schölkopf and smola 2002 about the relationship between c and g similar to the findings by cao and gu 2002 essvr was better than the traditional svr in the prediction of non stationary time series in addition the results indicated that essvr used fewer support vectors resulting in a sparser representation of the solutions generally essvr outperformed svr for all monthly standardized univariate except sbfi standardized bivariate and multivariate drought indices this improvement was observed for all the seasonal and semi annual indices except for ssi although the implication of essvr resulted in remarkable improvements in the results of sbfi ssi sri hadi and shadi not all the results were acceptable these indices are based on baseflow soil moisture and surface runoff in addition to other hydroclimatic variables which are more complex than the observed hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation rainfall snowpack snowmelt and evapotranspiration required for estimation of other drought indices in this study thus these drawbacks can be due to the following factors 1 the dominant hydroclimatic process such as frozen ground has been neglected in the nldas hence the unique features of cold climate regions have not been reflected in the simulated hydroclimatic variables by the nldas 2 the accumulation process of drought indices for conversion to larger time scales may cause these shortcomings especially for the bivariate and multivariate indices e g the performances of both essvr and svr for hadi and shadi unlike other standardized univariate indices became worse when larger time scales were used and 3 the employed predictors are not suitable for prediction of these drought indices and large scale climate indices that reflect the atmosphere ocean circulation pattern e g sea surface temperature southern oscillation index and north atlantic oscillation and instead local climate variables e g precipitation and temperature need to be used overall according to the results essvr had considerable improvements especially for the cases in which the drought prediction by svr was unacceptable therefore essvr can improve drought prediction especially for drought indices with high sensitivity to temperature in a warming climate 5 conclusions essvr for ssi and sbfi outperformed svr in the wetter and colder areas sspi sswei spei and hadi suggested the superiority of essvr in relatively drier and warmer areas essvr also showed the superiority for shadi in the colder areas for larger time scales for a broader variety of drought indices essvr outperformed svr regardless of the time scales of drought indices essvr outperformed svr when ssi sbfi and shadi were selected as the target variables despite noticeable similarities of spatial distributions of c values in svr and essvr smaller values of c were covered by higher percentages of the rrb in svr and higher values of c such as 15 and 20 were assigned in a higher percentage of the rrb in essvr the smaller c values in svr increased the training errors while the larger c values in essvr led to a hard margin svm and more sensitivity to the data noises despite the same coverage for ε values a larger coverage was assigned for the relatively higher and relatively lower values of ε for svr since the bigger ε values lad to more flat estimates and smaller ε values caused overfitting the better performance of essvr than svr was justified when essvr was employed the highest improvement was observed for sri among the monthly drought indices a significant decrease in rmse and a noticeable increase in r2 were observed for the monthly hadi and shadi for the girds with the highest improvement the application of essvr led to movement for r2 from negative to positive values the same results were observed for the seasonal indices except for ssi where a negative correlation was observed for svr the top three highest decreases in rmse values were observed for the semi annual sri sbfi and shadi the results were in accordance with other studies e g xu et al 2018 ali et al 2018 that reported improvements in prediction after applications of the ensemble methods in this study instead of using different models for the ensemble techniques the prediction models were developed based on the stationary subsets and the one with the highest accuracy was selected in addition like other similar studies cao and gu 2002 fan and tang 2013 grinblat et al 2015 peng 2010 ojemakinde 2006 better results were obtained for drought prediction after the application of essvr the levels of improvement varied depending upon the employed drought indices and their time scales there exist some limitations in this study which can be addressed in the future studies for example in this study by testing different change point detection methods and different numbers of change points two change points and window based change point detection method were used to convert a non stationary time series of temperature into stationary sub datasets using longer time series and correspondingly more change points can be considered for further analyses in this study a two year period was selected as the band for sliding window for change point to remove the impacts of monthly seasonal and interannual variabilities of temperature and identify the major change points due to a warming climate a wider band can be examined in the future studies different values of the hyperparameters were tested in the grid search cross validation and finally a limited number of values of the hyperparameters were selected for the prediction model based on the initial performance of the model and the suggested values in the literature using a wider range of the hyperparameters the model can be tested for further studies in this study the training dataset was divided into stationary sub datasets by change points and then each stationary dataset was further divided into k folds for cross validation however the training dataset can be divided into k folds based on the change points in the future studies overall the results suggested an improvement over the traditional svr model for prediction of droughts by considering the non stationarity in the temperature time series in a changing climate the proposed essvr model for improvement of drought prediction is able to provide more accurate drought prediction

3928,non stationarity due to climate change and or variability can reduce the capabilities of drought prediction models the objective of this study is to improve drought prediction by eliminating non stationarity from temperature time series a key factor in development and propagation of droughts in a changing climate in order to relax the assumption of stationarity an ensemble stationary based support vector regression essvr method was developed and compared with the traditional support vector regression svr three types of drought indices in three time scales monthly seasonal and semiannual including multivariate bivariate standardized drought indices and univariate standardized drought indices were used as the target variables in an application to the red river of the north basin rrb the north american land data assimilation system nldas data from 1979 to 2016 were used for the training and testing of the prediction model the pearson correlation root mean square error rmse and taylor diagram were used to evaluate the performances of the essvr remarkably the distribution of identified change points varies by climate divisions the results of the svr and essvr in the rrb were compared demonstrating the better performances of the essvr for most of the drought indices particularly those with higher sensitivity to temperature it was found that the extreme high and low values of hyperparameters mostly assigned by svr cause a higher risk of overfitting for svr in contrast essvr improves the drought prediction by removing the non stationarity thus providing more accurate drought predictions especially for a warming climate keywords drought prediction support vector regression nonstationary time series climate change change point detection tuning hyperparameters 1 introduction drought prediction is crucial for water resource management despite a large amount of literature there are still fundamental limitations in drought prediction models wood et al 2015 natural or anthropogenic changes in climatic hydrologic and or landscape processes cause non stationary conditions in time series of hydroclimatic variables ryberg et al 2020 jehanzaib et al 2020 and hence pose a challenge for reliable drought prediction hao et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 dutta and maity 2021 non stationarity of time series and change points points in a time series where the statistical properties change killick et al 2012 can cause violation of critical assumptions in drought prediction the 2012 drought which hit the upper great plains in the u s is one of the droughts that was not captured by the existing drought prediction models due to warming climate and non stationary time series hoerling et al 2014 thus the performances of drought prediction models may not be satisfactory unless the changes in climate are captured from historical records hao et al 2018 brunner et al 2021 therefore it is critical to consider non stationarity in drought prediction models ju et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2018 data driven statistical drought prediction models have the advantages of minimum data requirement and rapid development over dynamic models adamowski 2008 artificial neural network ann and support vector regression svr vapnik 1995 are among the well known drought prediction models ganguli and reddy 2014 yu et al 2006 to avoid the non stationarity problem in data driven drought prediction models various methodologies have been proposed for example decomposition methods e g wavelet transformation have been used extensively for drought prediction maity et al 2016 ozger et al 2011 wavelet ann deo et al 2017 kim and valdés 2003 wavelet svr belayneh et al 2014 and wavelet based hybrid ann arima khan et al 2020 are among these improved drought prediction models there are some studies investigating the impacts of non stationarity in svr in other fields for example dynamic support vector machines dsvms were proposed to model non stationary time series cao and gu 2002 to deal with the structural changes in the data the dsvms used an exponentially increasing regularization constant and an exponentially decreasing tube size instead of fixed values of the regularization constant and the tube size for all training data points cao and gu 2002 fan and tang 2013 decomposed the non stationary time series with monotonic trend items into a finite and often small number of intrinsic mode functions and a monotone residual trend item by the empirical mode decomposition emd and then applied the svr on each subset of data and finally integrated the results grinblat et al 2015 introduced a time adaptive support vector regression ta svr to improve prediction a novel regressor as twin svr was proposed by peng 2010 three different methods of transformation namely relative difference in percentages z score and natural logarithm transformations were applied to the data series ojemakinde 2006 in these studies better results were obtained after accounting for the non stationarity in time series change point detection techniques also can be used for drought analysis to overcome the non stationarity problem in data driven models change point analysis is an active area in statistics and an area of great interest in hydrology ryberg et al 2020 tavakol et al 2020 employed the mann kendall and pettitt tests to identify change points and nonstationary conditions of temperature indices for the missouri river basin ryberg et al 2020 conducted a study to detect change points of annual peak streamflow in the united states huang et al 2016 employed the heuristic segmentation method pedro et al 2001 to detect the changing points of annual streamflow time series from 1960 to 2012 in the columbia river basin jehanzaib et al 2020 investigated the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological drought by developing non stationary approaches significant decreases in precipitation and streamflow were observed after considering change points duggins et al 2010 developed a new method based on the empirical transition matrix generated by the standardized precipitation index spi for identification of change point s in the time series mazdiyansi and aghakouchak 2015 employed the cramer von mises change point detection method and found a significant shift in the distributions of droughts across the contiguous u s change point detection methods have been increasingly used in drought studies to overcome the aforementioned non stationarity problem ju et al 2021 achour et al 2020 in this study a change point detection technique is specifically coupled with the widely used svr to improve its performance for drought prediction the objective of this research is to improve the prediction of droughts in a changing climate by developing a new ensemble stationary based support vector regression essvr method correspondingly a new drought identification categorization and prediction dic predict system is developed for drought analyses to highlight the importance of snow drought in the warming climate dic predict is tested in a cold climate region in which snow snowmelt and snow accumulation are critical in drought identification especially in a warming climate this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the methodology algorithm and framework of the essvr model and the evaluation of essvr section 3 provides the results of essvr and traditional svr and their comparisons while section 4 discusses the results finally section 5 summarizes the conclusions and findings from this study 2 methodology the non stationarity issue in the traditional svr model reduces the capability of svr in prediction of droughts in a warming climate using a change point detection technique helps to identify where the changes in statistical properties of a temperature time series occur thus the dataset can be split into a set of stationery datasets based on the identified change points applying svr on each stationary dataset and implementing a weighting approach to ensemble the prediction results from all stationary svr models improve drought prediction 2 1 essvr model fig 1 shows the flowchart for the essvr method prior to applying the proposed methodology two tests are conducted to examine the stationarity non stationarity of the temperature time series specifically augmented dickey fuller adf dickey and fuller 1979 and kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin kpss kwiatkowski et al 1992 tests are used in this study if the non stationarity of the time series is confirmed by these tests a fast approximate window based change point detection method window sliding truong et al 2020 is used to split the nonstationary time series into multiple stationary time series svr is further conducted on each stationary subset of the training data an initial weight is assigned to the predicted values by svr on each subset of data and it is updated by comparison with the actual values and higher weights assigned to those with higher accuracy finally the prediction with the higher weight is selected as the final prediction for a temperature time series of t 1 j t 2 j t m j if the regime switches at month τ for grid j change point then t 1 j t τ j differ from t τ 1 j t m j in some statistical properties for example the means differ in series

change points in the temperature time series in the window sliding algorithm the discrepancies d between two adjacent windows that slide along the dataset are computed for a given cost function c the discrepancy between two subsets is given by truong et al 2020 2 d t a i t i b c t a b c t a i c t i b where c is a cost loss or error function for a given segment a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the sliding window once the computation of all discrepancies for all windows is completed a peak search procedure is performed to find the major change points truong et al 2020 fig 2 shows the svr model a with and b without assumption of stationarity the changing tube size instead of a fixed tube size in all the training data points is crucial to relax the assumption of stationarity in a prediction model the change point detection is used to identify the changes in the tube size and the corresponding hyperparameters in the svr if l change points are detected in the temperature time series the dataset is divided into l time series and svr is performed on each time series by removing the impacts of change points each time series is turned to l stationary time series the svr is a general regression model based on the relationship between predictor s x i j l and predictand i e drought indices di i j l f x i j l a nonlinear function is estimated as f x i j l by sum of a set of kernel functions the purpose of using the kernel function here is to transform the space from nonlinear to linear for input vector x i j l 3 di i j l f x i j l e j l where e j l is the error and f x i j l is estimated by vapnik 1995 4 f x i j l w j l x i j l b j l where w j l indicates the support vector weights basis functions and b j l is a bias term similar to the intercept in linear regression for each stationary time series in each grid the angle brackets represent a dot product the following regularized risk function needs to minimize the complexity i e the magnitude of w j l to estimate f x i j l during the training vapnik 1995 5 min 1 2 w j l 2 c j l i 1 n ξ i j l ξ i j l based on the ε insensetive approach the regularized risk function is subject to vapnik 1995 6 f x i j l w j l x i j l b j l ε j l ξ i j l 7 w j l x i j l b f x i j l ε j l ξ i j l 8 ξ i j l ξ i j l 0 where ξ i j l and ξ i j l are the slack variables used to determine the degree to which the state space samples with an error more than ε j l are penalized in construction of the predictor f x i j l errors will be tolerated to the degree of ε j l this optimization problem is solved by lagrange multipliers using scikit learn package pedregosa et al 2011 2 2 tuning hyperparameters in cross validation of svr the hyperparameters in an svr model play a key role in the performance of a prediction model therefore the spatial distributions of cost value c epsilon ε and gamma g are compared in svr and essvr c ε and g values affect the model complexity in different ways parameter c determines the tradeoff between the model complexity flatness and the training error joachims 2002 which is the degree to which deviations larger than ε are tolerated in the optimization formulation for example if c is too large infinity the objective is to minimize the empirical risk only without considering the model complexity in the optimization formulation a small value of c increases the training errors while a large c leads to a behavior similar to that of a hard margin svm joachims 2002 the margin is defined as the minimum distance from the decision boundary to the training points and a hard margin svm makes the svm overly sensitive to any noise in the data parameter ε controls the width of the ε insensitive zone used to fit the training data the value of ε has an effect on the smoothness of the svr s response and can affect the support vectors used to construct the regression function the bigger ε is the fewer support vectors are selected on the other hand bigger ε values result in more flat estimates if ε is greater than the range of the target values good result cannot be obtained schölkopf and smola 2002 on the other hand if ε is equal to zero overfitting occurs the optimal value of ε varies linearly with g variance of the gaussian noise schölkopf and smola 2002 which is a kernel parameter that reduces the model space and controls the complexity of the solution kisi and cimen 2011 cherkassky and mulier 1998 suggested the use of cross validation for the svm parameter choice a gird search cross validation approach is used for selection of the best hyperparameters in each stationary dataset fig 3 shows the cross validation in the traditional svr and essvr the hyperparameters are tuned by splitting the training data into several stationary subsets and the cross validation is performed on each subset for each subset the drought index is predicted for the same testing period the prediction that is closer to the actual values based on rmse is selected as the final prediction an ensemble technique is developed and employed on the outputs of essvr on stationary subsets of data di i j l this selective ensemble is developed as due to the variability or change in climate each subset of training data with different statistical properties identified and split by the change point techniques can potentially have different prediction results for a specific period the predicted values closer to the actual values are selected as the final prediction result the following algorithm is used for this selective ensemble technique on the results of the svr on each subset for l 1 2 l 1a initialize w 1 w 2 w l 1 l 1b draw a stationary subset s l from the training data for time step i 1 2 n 2a train regressor f l on s l 2b estimate the risk of f l according to the probability of discrepancy between the predicted and actual values p 1 p 2 p n 9 r l i 1 n p i di i f l x i 2c update w l w l 1 1 r l select the prediction with the highest weight which has the lowest risk 2 3 assessment of essvr root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 are used to compare the overall areal average performances of essvr and the traditional svr hereafter svr then a taylor diagram taylor 2001 for the grid with the largest difference between rmse values in essvr and svr is created to compare the performance of these two models to overcome the challenge in selecting the best performance measures the taylor diagram is commonly used in climate and environment studies to facilitate comparative assessment of different models it is used to quantify the degree of correspondence and correlation between the predicted and actual values in terms of three performance measures the pearson correlation coefficient the root mean square error rmse and the standard deviation the azimuthal angle depicts the pearson correlation coefficient the centered rmse in the predicted values is proportional to the distance from the actual values on the x axis the standard deviation of the predicted pattern is proportional to the radial distance from the origin 2 4 setup of essvr model to address different types of drought three types of drought indices in different time scales monthly seasonal and semiannual are used to set up the essvr model the target variables consist of multivariate hydroclimatic aggregate drought index hadi bazrkar et al 2020 and snow based hydroclimatic aggregate drought index shadi bazrkar and chu 2021 bivariate standardized drought indices based on the difference between precipitation and actual evapotranspiration spei and the summation of snowmelt and rainfall and univariate standardized drought indices based on precipitation surface runoff baseflow soil moisture snowpack and snow water equivalent standardized precipitation index spi standardized runoff index sri standardized baseflow index sbfi bazrkar and chu 2020 standardized soil moisture index ssi xu et al 2018 standardized snowpack index sspi and standardized snow water equivalent index sswei huning and aghakouchak 2018 are calculated by using the same method as the one by farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 by applying gringorten plotting position for each dataset and then standardizing the cumulative distribution function cdf the same method is applied on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration dfct and the summation of snowmelt and rainfall to calculate spei and standardized snowmelt and rain index smri staudinger et al 2014 respectively hadi is calculated by standardizing the first principal component in the principal component analysis pca on rainfall snowmelt surface runoff and soil moisture while shadi is computed by using precipitation and snowpack instead of rainfall and snowmelt to account for snow drought depending on the specific drought index that is used as the target variable in the prediction model different types of predictor s are used table 1 shows the predictands and their associated predictors precipitation p is used as a predictor for prediction of all drought indices temperature t is also used for prediction of spei smri sspi and sswei in addition actual evapotranspiration et and dfct are added in the prediction of hadi shadi ssi sri and sbfi the training and testing periods range from 1979 to 2010 and from 2011 to 2016 respectively the input data for calculation of the drought indices and drought prediction are obtained from the north american land data assimilation system nldas mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012 the goal of the nldas is to construct quality controlled and spatially and temporally consistent land surface model lsm datasets from the best available observations and model output to support modeling activities the nldas products are used in modeling research and applications such as drought and flood monitoring watershed and water quality management and case studies of extreme events there are two phases referred to as nldas 1 and nldas 2 the latter which spans january 1979 present is used in this study nldas integrates a large quantity of observation based and model reanalyzed data at 1 8th degree grid spacing over central north america mitchell et al 2004 xia et al 2012 2 5 study area the red river of the north basin rrb fig 4 a typical cold climate region in the northern great plain covers over 90 000 km2 in the u s part of rrb according to the noaa 2021 data the western part of the rrb is drier than the eastern part and the northern part is colder than the southern part the 100 year mean dataset fig 4 shows that the order of climate divisions cds from the driest to the wettest is as follows 3202 3205 3203 3206 3209 3903 2101 2104 and 2102 the same dataset also indicates the order of cds from the coldest to the warmest 2101 3203 3202 2101 3205 3206 3209 2104 and 3903 drought has significant impacts on the rrb since a great portion of the rrb is covered by cultivated croplands a variety of drought indices are used to test the essvr in the rrb in this study 3 results 3 1 results of change point detection the null hypothesis the time series is not stationary in the adf test failed to be rejected by a significance level of 5 for all grids the null hypothesis for the kpss test the time series is stationary is rejected by a significance level of 10 for all girds the spatial patterns of the first and the second identified change points on the monthly temperature time series are shown in fig 5 the numbers in the legend refer to time steps starting from january 1979 wherein 45 160 195 220 255 260 275 and 300 are related to september 1982 april 1992 march 1995 april 1997 march 2000 august 2000 november 2001 and december 2003 respectively the first change point is identified in august 2000 for a great portion of the area 45 in cds 3206 and 3209 and cd 2101 in the southern part in 28 of the rrb mostly in northeastern part of cd 2101 and that part of cd 2102 the first change points were identified in april 1997 grid 261 highlighted in fig 5 was one of these grids the temperature time series and the identified change points are shown in fig 5 the second change point for this grid is identified in november 2001 when 65 of the rrb cds 3206 3209 3903 2104 2101 and 2102 has the same second change point august 2000 was identified as the second change points in 23 of the rrb cd 3203 the average values of monthly temperature through the entire training period the period from january 1979 to the first change point and the period between the first and the second change points are 4 48 3 80 and 6 54 respectively there also are slight changes in the standard deviation values namely 12 63 12 86 and 11 64 were the standard deviations of the entire training period the period from january 1979 to the first change point and the period between the first and the second change points respectively 3 2 assessment of essvr by comparison with the traditional svr to measure the performance of essvr it is compared with svr without considering the non stationarity in the temperature times series the comparison of the performances of essvr and svr for the monthly indices is conducted based on the difference between the rmse of the results for svr and essvr figs 6 8 in these figures blue spots show the points with superiority of essvr and the red spots depict the points with inferiority of the essvr for spi and sri the blue spots are accumulated in cd 3203 the 3rd driest and the 2nd coldest cd in the rrb fig 6 the blue spots for ssi were mostly located in cd 2101 the 3rd wettest and the 4th coldest cd in the rrb fig 6 for sbfi cd 2102 the wettest and coldest region showed the superiority of essvr over svr due to the accumulation of the blue spots fig 6 for sspi sswei spei and hadi the blue spots were piled up in cd 3206 the 4th driest and the 4th warmest cd in the rrb figs 6 8 for shadi the blue spots were gathered in cds 3203 and 3202 fig 8 fig 9 shows the various ranges of the differences between the rmse values in svr and essvr for monthly seasonal and semi annual drought indices overall essvr for shadi had lower rmse values in 71 of the rrb which was the highest coverage among monthly drought indices 54 45 38 33 and 28 were the coverage percentages of superiority essvr over svr with the ranges of the differences of rmse higher than 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 respectively the monthly ssi and spei had the second largest area coverage 51 with lower rmse for essvr than that of svr among the seasonal indices sri had the highest area coverage for all ranges of the differences in the rmse values for essvr and svr except for the difference greater than 0 05 sbfi had the largest coverage for the difference greater 0 05 36 for sri 64 52 46 42 37 and 32 were the coverage percentages of superiority of essvr over svr with the range greater than 0 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 respectively like the monthly indices the largest coverage of superiority of essvr over svr was observed for the semi annual shadi for shadi 66 60 54 49 46 and 42 were the coverage percentages of superiority of essvr over svr with the range greater than 0 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 respectively generally the coverage percentage of superiority of essvr over svr increased by increasing the time scales of drought indices overall the monthly ssi spei and shadi and the seasonal sri ssi sbfi spei smri hadi and shadi and the semi annual ssi sbfi sspi sswei spei hadi and shadi were among the indices with more than 50 of the area showing better performances of essvr than svr 3 3 spatial distributions of hyperparameters in svr and essvr the spatial distributions of c epsilon ε and gamma g in svr and essvr were compared fig 10 considering shadi as the target variable shadi was selected since it had the largest coverage of the differences in rmse for svr and essvr fig 9 thus it can be helpful to investigate the reasons behind the superiority of essvr over svr the spatial patterns of c values were almost the same for svr and essvr and there was only a minor discrepancy the same percentage of rrb was assigned to the c values equal to 1 73 and 25 4 for both svr and essvr however a slightly higher percentage of the area was covered by c values of 15 4 and 20 2 in essvr comparing with 1 and 1 respectively in svr 14 and 6 of the rrb were covered by c values of 5 and 10 for svr however a slightly smaller percentage was assigned to the same values of c in essvr 12 and 5 overall the difference was not significant but it can be concluded that the smaller values of c were covered by a higher percentage of the rrb in svr and higher values of c such as 15 and 20 were assigned in a higher percentage of the rrb in essvr fig 10 shows a smaller area coverage 41 in essvr comparing with 46 in svr covered by ε equal to 1 a smaller coverage i e 5 for svr comparing with 4 for essvr is also assigned to ε of 0 001 however a larger coverage 36 was for a value of 0 1 for essvr comparing with 30 for svr similarly 9 coverage for 0 0001 and 10 coverage for 0 01 were observed for svr and essvr respectively ignoring the similar coverage for 0 0001 and 0 01 higher coverage percentages were assigned for the relatively high e g 1 and low values of ε e g 0 001 for svr significant differences between the coverages of g values in svr and essvr were observed for g equal to 0 1 and 5 80 of the rrb was covered by g equal to 0 1 i e the lowest g value in this study for essvr the corresponding percentage for svr was 60 however for the highest value of g equal to 5 a higher percentage 18 was covered for svr comparing with 5 for essvr thus essvr was inclined to the lower values of g according to schölkopf and smola 2002 g values are related to ε while higher values of c were assigned for essvr it inclined to assign lower values of g 3 4 grid based analysis of performances of essvr and svr finally the grid with the largest difference in rmse of svr and essvr for each drought index was identified and a taylor diagram was created to compare the performances of svr and essvr among the monthly drought indices fig 11 the highest improvement was observed for sri the rmse increased by 0 19 and r2 increased from 0 06 to 0 62 comparing essvr and svr the standard deviations of the predicted values by essvr were much closer to those of the observed values for the monthly sbfi both svr and essvr were out of range of the taylor diagram since their r2 values were negative the application of a seasonal time scale for sbfi caused no change fig 12 while there was a slight improvement in the results after a semi annual time scale was used fig 13 the results of svr for hadi and shadi were not acceptable based on the r2 values however the implication of essvr led to an improvement in the results almost the same results were observed for the seasonal and semi annual indices figs 12 and 13 for the seasonal indices minor differences existed for ssi where a negative correlation was observed for svr however the application of essvr led to an improvement in the results r2 increased from 0 61 to 0 39 and rmse had a decrease of 0 29 in rmse although a similar improvement was not observed after the application of the semi annual time scale for ssi for all other drought indices noticeable improvements in the results were observed for the semi annual indices fig 13 the top three highest decreases in rmse were for sri sbfi and shadi for sri r2 increased from 0 56 to 0 46 and rmse decreased by 0 45 for shadi and sbfi decreases by 0 46 and 0 43 in rmse were observed respectively despite a decrease in rmse of essvr the r2 values for both svr and essvr were negative and not in the range of the taylor diagram 4 discussion the results of the adf and kpss tests confirm that the temperature time series in all grids are non stationary thus the change point detection was conducted on the temperature time series there existed an agreement between the cds and the first change points the spatial pattern of the second change points can be divided into the northern and southern parts of the rrb the statistical properties of the temperature time series confirmed the accuracy of the identified change points and highlighted the necessity of considering the non stationarity for prediction of droughts in a warming climate various reasons such as natural and or anthropogenic changes in climatic hydrologic and or landscape processes can be accounted for the identified change points in the datasets however since the change point detection analysis is conducted on the temperature time series it can be concluded that the non stationarity and the identified change points on the time series of temperature a key hydroclimatic variable in warming climate can be attributed to climate change the identified change points can be regarded as a result of trend varying mean through time and or seasonality time dependent variance in both cases non stationarity is captured from the historical records and drought prediction is improved overall there are various reasons for the superiority of essvr over svr for each drought index since the predictor for spi is precipitation the impact of consideration of the non stationarity in the temperature time series is attributed to the separation of snowfall and rainfall in this cold climate region thus the superiority of essvr over svr in cold and dry climate for cd 3203 is related to the higher sensitivity of spi to temperature in a relatively colder and drier region shukla and wood 2008 suggested to use sri for the regions with prevalent snowmelt the impact of removing the non stationarity in temperature as one of the predictors of sri is reflected on the superiority of essvr in a relatively colder and snowmelt dominant region ssi and sbfi are related to soil moisture and baseflow respectively the superiority of essvr in the wetter and colder regions for these two indices is related to the effect of frozen ground and its relation to the soil moisture and baseflow in the rrb sspi sswei spei and hadi are more sensitive to temperature which can be the main reason for the superiority of essvr cds 3203 and 3209 the 4th wettest cd and the 3rd warmest cd in the rrb have the densest accumulation of blue spots for smri fig 7 based on the summation of rainfall and snowmelt using essvr in a warmer and wetter region is more beneficial since rainfall is dominant in such a region cd 3202 is the driest and the 3rd coldest cd in the rrb shadi has been primarily developed to identify snow drought by considering snowpack in its calculation the superiority of essvr in cds 3203 and 3202 which are among the top driest and coldest cds in this region is related to this feature of shadi overall the results suggested that 1 by increasing the time scales more drought indices showed better performances by considering the stationarity in essvr and 2 regardless of the time scale essvr outperformed svr when ssi sbfi and shadi were selected as the target variables since these indices are sensitive to temperature considering the relationships of soil moisture and baseflow to frozen ground in ssi and sbfi and snowpack in shadi consideration of the stationarity of the temperature as one of the predictors improved the drought prediction hyperparameters play key roles in the performances of svr and essvr models smaller c values in svr can increase the training errors while larger c values in essvr can lead to a hard margin svm and higher sensitivity in the data noises the better performance of essvr than svr can be related to the fact that larger ε values can lead to more flat estimates and smaller ε values can cause overfitting when larger values of c were assigned by essvr it inclined to assign smaller values of g this finding confirmed the results by schölkopf and smola 2002 about the relationship between c and g similar to the findings by cao and gu 2002 essvr was better than the traditional svr in the prediction of non stationary time series in addition the results indicated that essvr used fewer support vectors resulting in a sparser representation of the solutions generally essvr outperformed svr for all monthly standardized univariate except sbfi standardized bivariate and multivariate drought indices this improvement was observed for all the seasonal and semi annual indices except for ssi although the implication of essvr resulted in remarkable improvements in the results of sbfi ssi sri hadi and shadi not all the results were acceptable these indices are based on baseflow soil moisture and surface runoff in addition to other hydroclimatic variables which are more complex than the observed hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation rainfall snowpack snowmelt and evapotranspiration required for estimation of other drought indices in this study thus these drawbacks can be due to the following factors 1 the dominant hydroclimatic process such as frozen ground has been neglected in the nldas hence the unique features of cold climate regions have not been reflected in the simulated hydroclimatic variables by the nldas 2 the accumulation process of drought indices for conversion to larger time scales may cause these shortcomings especially for the bivariate and multivariate indices e g the performances of both essvr and svr for hadi and shadi unlike other standardized univariate indices became worse when larger time scales were used and 3 the employed predictors are not suitable for prediction of these drought indices and large scale climate indices that reflect the atmosphere ocean circulation pattern e g sea surface temperature southern oscillation index and north atlantic oscillation and instead local climate variables e g precipitation and temperature need to be used overall according to the results essvr had considerable improvements especially for the cases in which the drought prediction by svr was unacceptable therefore essvr can improve drought prediction especially for drought indices with high sensitivity to temperature in a warming climate 5 conclusions essvr for ssi and sbfi outperformed svr in the wetter and colder areas sspi sswei spei and hadi suggested the superiority of essvr in relatively drier and warmer areas essvr also showed the superiority for shadi in the colder areas for larger time scales for a broader variety of drought indices essvr outperformed svr regardless of the time scales of drought indices essvr outperformed svr when ssi sbfi and shadi were selected as the target variables despite noticeable similarities of spatial distributions of c values in svr and essvr smaller values of c were covered by higher percentages of the rrb in svr and higher values of c such as 15 and 20 were assigned in a higher percentage of the rrb in essvr the smaller c values in svr increased the training errors while the larger c values in essvr led to a hard margin svm and more sensitivity to the data noises despite the same coverage for ε values a larger coverage was assigned for the relatively higher and relatively lower values of ε for svr since the bigger ε values lad to more flat estimates and smaller ε values caused overfitting the better performance of essvr than svr was justified when essvr was employed the highest improvement was observed for sri among the monthly drought indices a significant decrease in rmse and a noticeable increase in r2 were observed for the monthly hadi and shadi for the girds with the highest improvement the application of essvr led to movement for r2 from negative to positive values the same results were observed for the seasonal indices except for ssi where a negative correlation was observed for svr the top three highest decreases in rmse values were observed for the semi annual sri sbfi and shadi the results were in accordance with other studies e g xu et al 2018 ali et al 2018 that reported improvements in prediction after applications of the ensemble methods in this study instead of using different models for the ensemble techniques the prediction models were developed based on the stationary subsets and the one with the highest accuracy was selected in addition like other similar studies cao and gu 2002 fan and tang 2013 grinblat et al 2015 peng 2010 ojemakinde 2006 better results were obtained for drought prediction after the application of essvr the levels of improvement varied depending upon the employed drought indices and their time scales there exist some limitations in this study which can be addressed in the future studies for example in this study by testing different change point detection methods and different numbers of change points two change points and window based change point detection method were used to convert a non stationary time series of temperature into stationary sub datasets using longer time series and correspondingly more change points can be considered for further analyses in this study a two year period was selected as the band for sliding window for change point to remove the impacts of monthly seasonal and interannual variabilities of temperature and identify the major change points due to a warming climate a wider band can be examined in the future studies different values of the hyperparameters were tested in the grid search cross validation and finally a limited number of values of the hyperparameters were selected for the prediction model based on the initial performance of the model and the suggested values in the literature using a wider range of the hyperparameters the model can be tested for further studies in this study the training dataset was divided into stationary sub datasets by change points and then each stationary dataset was further divided into k folds for cross validation however the training dataset can be divided into k folds based on the change points in the future studies overall the results suggested an improvement over the traditional svr model for prediction of droughts by considering the non stationarity in the temperature time series in a changing climate the proposed essvr model for improvement of drought prediction is able to provide more accurate drought prediction

3929,in this study a linear discriminant analysis lda based nomenclature system have been used for the classification of groundwater samples in a coastal aquifer the capability of three models 7 hlr 7 m conc and greater molar conc in determining the water types has been investigated the results show that ca hco3 na cl and na hco3 and ca hco3 na hco3 and na cl are the three dominant water types for the wet and dry seasons respectively the results of 7 hlr basic hybrid model as the best option show that 42 and 27 water types can be identified for wet and dry seasons respectively twenty four physicochemical components have been used for the hydrogeochemical study of selected water resources based on kohonen s self organizing map som method the k means clustering tool detected 7 and 6 clusters using the davies bouldin index dbi for the wet and dry seasons respectively hydrogeochemical assessment of duplicated samples showed that the seasonal changes can not cause significant changes in the chemical composition of groundwater resources of this aquifer radar diagrams of physicochemical variables showed some changes in the chemical composition of groundwater in some locations due to water rock interaction as well as pollutants produced by human activities comparison of the results of classification of water samples by som and principal component analysis pca shows that both methods can perform clustering of samples correctly however the som method provides more accurate clustering without any overlap between different clusters keywords groundwater classification linear discriminant analysis self organizing maps k means clustering principal component analysis coastal aquifer 1 introduction many people around the world live in coastal areas and their lives depend on available natural resources such as access to water population growth and increased human activities have caused the production of various pollutants and this along with climate change has exacerbated adverse conditions in such areas khan et al 2021a 2021b continuation of these conditions can lead to environmental degradation endangering living organisms and human health li et al 2018 shukla and saxena 2020 2021 wang et al 2020 sohrabi et al 2021 therefore it seems that urgent measures should be taken to manage and protect groundwater resources exposed to pollution especially in arid and semi arid coastal areas facing groundwater scarcity amiri et al 2021a 2021b wu et al 2021 hydrogeochemical assessment and spatiotemporal determination of groundwater chemical type can help identify the potential for sustainable development in these areas and prevent adverse health consequences in the future wu et al 2017 li et al 2021 numerous researchers have attempted to classify water samples using a variety of methods e g hill 1940 piper 1944 romani 1981 chadha 1999 güler et al 2002 gimenez forcada 2010 perez espinosa et al 2019 in many of these endeavors appropriate computer programs are also provided the hill piper classification method which can identify 5 general types of water has been used in many studies as an ideal method for determining the quality and chemical type of water the researchers tried to optimize the structure of the hill piper diagram to improve its performance in identifying the further water types for example durov 1948 used a rectangular field to represent water types subsequently stiff 1951 attempted to provide a schematic pattern of changes in the concentration of major ions in water samples handa 1965 also proposed a water division system for irrigation taking into account the salinity of water in addition to the major ions lioyd 1965 also presented an improved version of durov diagrams after the studies mentioned the researchers tried to consider more parameters for classifying water samples e g kemp 1971 in this regard d amore et al 1983 and stuyfzand 1989 also focused on improving methods and diagrams one of the most important shortcomings of the discussed methods especially in identifying the mechanisms controlling the chemical composition of water is considering the linear trend for mixing waters of different qualities e g saline water and freshwater verma et al 2021 for example groundwater mixing ratios are a function of various hydrogeochemical processes such as carbonate dissolution cation exchange and redox potential in addition in the hill piper method and its other modifications no clear boundaries between different types of water can be identified and they are mostly overlapping haselbeck et al 2019 therefore it seems that accurate identification and analysis of these complex hydrogeochemical mechanisms requires the use of the most robust methods such as log ratio transformations not conventional methods based on ternary diagrams verma 2015 2020 the log ratio transformation method has already been used by shelton et al 2018 however similar to ternary diagrams they use the sum of na and k as well as hco3 and co3 in the analyzes verma et al 2021 believed that there was no geochemical reason for using a combination of these cations and anions in other words to identify the exact mechanism of change in the chemical composition of water in an aquifer small changes must be examined which means identifying more water types using hybrid log ratios of the molar concentration of major 8 ions through linear discriminant analysis lda can lead to much more detailed results than other available methods verma et al 2021 despite the ability of this method to distinguish different types of water it should be noted that it is based only on 4 cations and 4 anions therefore to study the hydrogeochemical conditions and analyze the natural and human factors in changing the water quality more chemical components should be considered on the other hand providing accurate and reliable interpretation as well as identifying patterns and complex relationships between different types of water requires reducing the size of the data and their clustering li et al 2018 clark et al 2020 multivariate approaches such as principal component analysis pca hierarchical cluster analysis hca discriminant analysis da and self organizing maps som are among the most widely used tools for assessing spatiotemporal changes in groundwater chemical composition wu et al 2014 2019 li et al 2019 amiri et al 2017 nakagawa et al 2020 santos et al 2020 some studies have shown that in complex data sets with abundant physicochemical components it is impossible to determine the exact correlation between parameters and their classification simultaneously by hca and pca approaches choi et al 2014 qu et al 2021 however r mode and q mode hca can provide better results compared to pca because in nonlinear problems the pca method cannot place samples in appropriate clusters haselbeck et al 2019 in contrast som kohonen 1982 1990 kohonen et al 2001 as an artificial intelligence network can provide better results in complex and linear problems astel et al 2007 because the results of this method are not affected by errors noise due to sampling process and laboratory measurements in addition the presence of outliers in complex high dimensional datasets that are found in many contaminated aquifers with different land uses cannot cause errors in the results li et al 2018 clark et al 2020 santos et al 2020 qu et al 2021 in this method high dimensional datasets are converted onto a two dimensional network of nodes based on the dissimilarity of the samples this representation known as component planes is done by maintaining the original topological relationship of the input data component planes can be generated for each of the variables and thus it is possible to compare them node by node wu et al 2021 in addition k means clustering can be used to determine the similarity between different samples and nodes as well as the optimal number of clusters brentan et al 2018 santos et al 2020 due to the high capabilities of the som method it has been used in sciences such as hydrology wallner et al 2013 farsadnia et al 2014 meteorology nishiyama et al 2007 duviver et al 2016 and soil quality rivera et al 2015 this method can also be a powerful tool for analyzing hydrogeological data such as groundwater level changes nourani et al 2016 wunsch et al 2018 nakagawa et al 2019 and groundwater quality classification nguyen et al 2015 nakagawa et al 2017 he et al 2019 he and wu 2019 lee et al 2019 kim et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 in this study a lda based nomenclature system has been used to classify the groundwater samples in addition the results are compared with the results of classification based on greater molar concentration then a combination of som and k means methods have been used to study the spatiotemporal changes of groundwater and to identify the relationships between physicochemical components in the coastal aquifer of urmia northwestern iran also the pca method has been used to interpret the relationships between different clusters and the role of natural and anthropogenic factors in controlling the chemical composition of groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area urmia aquifer is located in the west of the urmia lake ul northwest of iran this alluvial aquifer with an area of about 750 km2 is known as the most important source of water supply for various uses of drinking agriculture and industry fig 1 this highly heterogeneous aquifer is composed of sediments of different sizes the maximum thickness of this aquifer in the northern and southern parts is about 160 to 130 m respectively amiri et al 2021c according to the topography of this region the direction of groundwater flow is from west to east adjacent to ul the aquifer is surrounded by sedimentary such as limestone sandstone conglomerate igneous such as granite gabbro basalt and metamorphic such as gneiss quartzite and marble rocks from precambrian to tertiary supplementary fig s1 sohrabi et al 2017 the existence of mineral reserves in some igneous and metamorphic formations has led to the development of mining activities in some areas this aquifer is directly recharged by mediterranean climatic currents the average long term rainfall is about 346 mm sohrabi et al 2021 which is about 60 mm more than the average rainfall in iran as an arid and semi arid region however high population density development of agricultural activities industrial activities as well as reduced rainfall rates have caused the water resources of this area to be under additional stress also the activity of more than 18 000 authorized wells and 25 000 unauthorized wells has caused the groundwater abstraction rate to increase and be uncontrollable all of these conditions lead to a nearly 540 cm decrease in groundwater level over the past 34 years amiri et al 2021d 2 2 sample collection and analysis in this study 84 and 58 groundwater samples were collected in the wet and dry seasons respectively to determine the spatial variation of groundwater quality the second sampling period was repeated at 58 points these samples have a good distribution in the coastal areas and can provide groundwater quality changes without a significant gap samples were collected according to recommended procedures apha 1985 iso 5667 11 1993 and from production wells with depths between 10 and 120 m to provide fresh water and avoid errors in the results due to stagnant water and well storage the samples were pumped after at least a few tens of minutes and prepared directly from the well outlet at each sampling point two 250 ml pet bottles were stored after passing through a 0 45 μm filter the water of one of these bottles was acidified by adding ultra pure nitric acid ph 2 and used to determine the concentration of cations and metal components another non acidified bottle was taken to the laboratory to determine the concentration of anions before delivering the samples to the laboratory they were kept at 4 c in this study the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms method was used to determine the concentration of calcium ca magnesium mg potassium k sodium na arsenic as boron b aluminum al barium ba rubidium rb silica si uranium u zinc zn strontium sr ph titration with h2so4 to measure carbonate co3 and bicarbonate hco3 concentration ion chromatography to determine the concentration of bromide br and fluoride f aquakem discrete analyzer to detect the concentration of chloride cl and sulfate so4 and a spectrophotometer was used to measure the concentration of nitrate no3 some parameters including ec tds ph and eh are also measured onsite using a portable hach multimeter a statistical summary of the results of the chemical analysis of water samples in both wet and dry seasons is presented in table 1 2 3 water molar classification system from lda this method uses the concentration of 4 major cations ca na mg and k and 4 major anions hco3 co3 so4 and cl and includes three models 7 hybrid log ratio 7 hlr 7 m concentration 7 m conc and greater molar concentration greater molar conc first using the concept of the greater molar concentration known as the greater molar conc model 16 main types of water is determined the main idea of this proposed classification method is the independence of 4 major cations and 4 major anions from each other then 7 hybrid log ratio hlr2 hlr8 was used for linear discriminant analysis and determination of 16 discriminant functions in the 7 hlr model the hlr calculation for each sample is determined using the following equation verma et al 2021 1 hl r i 1 ln g e e i 1 where ge represents the geometric mean of the 8 major ions and e represents the chemical component in this way seven hlr 7 hlr can be set for example 2 hl r 2 ln c a m g n a k s o 4 c l h c o 3 c o 3 1 8 mg the lda uses discriminant functions as follows 3 d f α h τ h c 2 h l r 2 h c 3 h l r 3 h c 4 h l r 4 h c 5 h l r 5 h c 6 h l r 6 h c 7 h l r 7 h c 8 h l r 8 h c 0 where α is 1 or 2 τ represents the type of diagram h represents hlr and hc are the empirical coefficients which are presented by verma et al 2021 after applying the discriminant functions of the 7 hlr model and determining the cation and anion probabilities and comparing them the final decision of the 7 hlr model can be obtained the obtained results will be available in two basic i e selection of the final cation and anion and basic hybrid i e two major cations and two major anions it should be noted that the basic hybrid option can identify up to 256 water types lda is performed without any log transformation on the molar concentrations of the chemical components and this model is known as 7 m conc model to determine the water type using the 7 m conc model the discriminant functions of the 7 m conc model should also be applied in this method after calculating the cation and anion probabilities and comparison of probabilities the water type can be determined based on the 7 m conc model method in this model as in the 7 hlr model the lda uses the following discriminant functions 4 d f α m τ m c 2 m c e l e m 2 m c 3 m c e l e m 3 m c 4 m c e l e m 4 m c 5 m c e l e m 5 m c 6 m c e l e m 6 m c 7 m c e l e m 7 m c 8 m c e l e m 8 m c 0 where α is 1 or 2 τ represents the type of diagram mcelem represents molar concentration and mc are the empirical coefficients which are presented by verma et al 2021 in these three models after determining the water type of the original samples robustness and uncertainty of classifications are examined for this purpose 2200 new compositions are simulated based on the original data set using the monte carlo simulation procedure then with the same method the water type of this synthetic data set is determined again in this way these results can be compared with the results of the classification original data set and their accuracy can be evaluated details of this method can be found in verma et al 2021 and verma 2020 in this study an online computer program watermclasys lda http tlaloc ier unam mx was used to run the 7 hlr 7 m conc and greater molar conc models 2 4 self organizing map som som as an artificial neural network can reduce the dimensions of high dimensional data sets based on similarities and turn them into a two dimensional structure jin et al 2011 the main purpose of this method is to identify reference also weight or prototype vectors through an iterative process in the training phase nguyen et al 2015 the som training algorithm uses the euclidean distance between the concentrations of chemical components as input vectors haselbeck et al 2019 in general the steps of creating a som include i designing and constructing an input data matrix ii initial data processing including standardization normalization and transformation iii designing a som structure including calculating the number of nodes and their configuration iv selection of a right initializing method v proper som training and vi display of samples on a map based on their degree of matching with the nearest node clark et al 2020 the accuracy of som results is a function of the number of map nodes accordingly small maps may not detect some patterns in the data set cereghino and park 2009 on the other hand the larger size of the som increases the model s ability to identify patterns in the data set structure liu et al 2006 nguyen et al 2015 however in large maps some nodes may be empty and no water sample may match them this means that the patterns identified by these nodes do not actually exist in the data set kohonen 2013 clark et al 2017 2020 a quick and easy way to determine the size number of nodes of a map is to use thumb or heuristics rules according to the most widely used method the number of nodes should be approximately equal to 5 number of samples nakagawa et al 2020 after the training process and determination of reference vectors clustering can be done using existing methods there are various clustering methods one of the most important and widely used for som is the k means algorithm li et al 2018 clark et al 2020 the optimal number of clusters can be determined based on the k means method and using the davies bouldin index dbi since this index provides the average similarity between clusters its lowest value indicates the highest dissimilarity between clusters and is considered as the number of optimal clusters santos et al 2020 another effective way to determine clusters is to use within cluster sum of squares wcss which works by finding a point called elbow point haselbeck et al 2019 complementing this method is the use of the silhouette coefficient in this study calculations and visualization of som were performed using the som toolbox in matlab 5 vesanto et al 2000 3 results and discussion 3 1 lda based nomenclature of water one of the most important steps to be taken for water classification using the lda method is to convert the concentrations from mg l to meq l and then to meq l to mmol l supplementary tables s1 and s4 provide a statistical summary of the original and simulated data sets in the wet and dry seasons respectively the results show that the minimum maximum average and standard deviation of the original and simulated data sets are very close to each other in this study the capability of three models 7 hlr 7 m conc and greater molar conc in determining the water types has been investigated in the first attempt the water types for both wet and dry seasons are determined based on the classic greater molar conc model tables 2 and 3 these results have been used for examining the degree of compatibility of the other two methods the results show that ca hco3 na cl and na hco3 and ca hco3 na hco3 and na cl are the three dominant water types for the wet and dry seasons respectively thus na appears to be the predominant cation in more than 50 of the samples similar results by amiri et al 2016c have been reported in a study aimed at investigating the possible impact of ul on the chemical composition of groundwater using hydrochemical facies evolution hfe diagram gimenez forcada 2010 it should be noted that the hfe diagram can also identify 16 water types which in this respect works similar to the 7 hlr basic model therefore the similarity of the results of these two approaches is to be expected the lda approach is used to determine the water type using 7 hlr and 7 m conc models before that for the 7 hlr model the values hlr2 hlr8 must be determined and then used to prepare df1hτ and df2hτ for different cations and anions in this study after calculating the values of hlr2 hlr8 supplementary table s5 and s6 the values of df1h and df2h for 4 groups of cations including mg na and k ca mg and na ca mg and k and finally ca na and k were prepared for both wet and dry seasons in addition the values of df1h and df2h for 4 classes of anions also include so4 cl and hco3 so4 cl and co3 so4 hco3 and co3 and finally cl hco3 and co3 are prepared for both wet and dry seasons supplementary figs s2 and s3 it should be noted that after calculating hlrs and df1hτ and df2hτ based on the original data set these calculations are also done for the simulated data set based on the monte carlo simulation law and kelton 2000 verma and quiroz ruiz 2006 for evaluating the uncertainty of results supplementary figs s4 and s5 the results clearly show that the types determined based on the 7 hlr model for both wet and dry seasons are very similar to those determined by the greater molar conc model in general 10 and 8 general water types have been identified for water samples in the wet and dry seasons respectively these results are based on the 7 hlr basic model and as expected this option can determine up to 16 water types using 8 main ions due to the high similarity of the results of the 7 hlr basic model with the greater molar conc model it seems that it can be introduced as the optimal model verma et al 2021 have reported similar results however the 7 hlr basic hybrid model is capable of identifying 256 water types it should be noted that this model also uses 8 major ions with the difference that up to two main cations and two anions can be introduced for each water type accordingly table 4 presents the results of the nomenclature of water samples the results show that 42 and 27 water types can be identified for wet and dry seasons respectively the lower number of identified water types for the dry season may be due to the smaller size of the data set compared to the wet season the number of water types determined based on the 7 hlr method basic hybrid in the simulated data set also shows that 84 and 55 water types can be identified for wet and dry seasons respectively supplementary tables s7 and s8 according to the results presented in tables 2 and 3 and the comparison of all three naming models the results of 7 m conc model are more different from the other two models therefore the classification results of the original and the simulated data sets by 7 m conc model for wet and dry seasons are presented in supplementary tables s9 s12 in addition the classification results for simulated data set by the greater molar conc model in both seasons are presented in supplementary tables s13 s16 details of classification and water types determined by different models are also provided in supplementary tables s17 and s18 as mentioned earlier the results of the water nomenclature by 7 hlr basic model are very similar to the greater molar conc model 7 hlr basic hybrid option can provide better conditions for interpretation of hydrogeochemical status and the reactions that sometimes occur between different ions e g cation exchange process as mentioned na and ca are the two dominant cations and hco3 and cl are the two dominant anions in these samples several water types can be identified according to the concentration of these ions therefore according to tables 2 and 3 ca hco3 as the dominance of freshwater na cl as the dominance of saline water and na hco3 as the indicator of the effect of saline water by direct cation exchange are the main water types in this area amiri et al 2016b in addition the presence of some geological compounds containing mg e g dolomite as well as sulfur e g gypsum and the performance of processes such as dedolomitization and dissolution can create other water types containing mg and so4 supplementary fig s1 the position of the main water types identified by the 7 hlr basic model fig 2 shows that the samples commonly known as freshwater ca mg hco3 co3 cover a large part of the study area in contrast samples with na cl composition which are known as saline and unsuitable waters for various uses are mainly found in areas very close to the shore of ul or in the vicinity of rock structures the interaction of water with these rock formations as well as the presence of salty playa near the lake can be the source of cl and na in these samples amiri et al 2017 the na hco3 na co3 and na so4 water types which have been identified in many samples also indicate the replacement of ca mg and na through the direct cation exchange process on the other hand the ca cl type also indicates the mechanism of reverse cation exchange in other words these samples have a cation similar to freshwaters but their anion is similar to saline water these samples are also in the middle of the path from freshwaters to saline waters performance of ion exchange process and enrichment or depletion of some cations in some water samples in this part of the aquifer is described by amiri et al 2016a 2016b 3 2 clustering of samples by som in this study 24 physicochemical components table 1 have been used for the hydrogeochemical study of groundwater data sets based on the som method accordingly the number of som computational nodes which is a function of data set size for wet and dry seasons was about 48 and 38 respectively thus to prevent the loss of some data the final size of som nodes in these two seasons was considered to be 50 and 40 respectively the component planes of the 24 physicochemical variables for the wet and dry seasons are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively as shown in fig 3 some components such as ec tds cl mg k co3 hco3 rb b and br have strong positive correlations a strong positive correlation can also be observed between sr so4 no3 and ca the correlation between ca and so4 refers to the role of geogenic factors such as gypsum and anhydrite dissolution in this case the role of anthropogenic factors such as agricultural activities and leakage of domestic and industrial wastewater in increasing the concentration of these components especially no3 should be considered amiri et al 2016c the moderate correlation between ca and f can also indicate the role of the dissolution of minerals containing these two elements such as fluorite caf2 in increasing their concentration in water sources given the distribution of geological formations and their chemical composition in this region a strong positive correlation between al and as also indicates their common geological origin sohrabi et al 2021 some other elements such as u and br also have moderate correlation which can be a function of different processes due to the overlap with other components for example sohrabi et al 2018 and amiri et al 2017 showed that the highest u concentration was recorded near igneous rocks they also cited factors such as the desorption of u from the surface of fe containing minerals and clay minerals as mechanisms for controlling u concentration as shown in fig 4 similar to what was previously said for the physicochemical components of the wet season data set some obvious relationships can also be observed between the physicochemical components in the dry season data set in this case there is a strong correlation between ec and tds with the major ions including cl na mg k as well as some variables including ba and rb also the strong positive correlation of co3 ca and so4 indicates the role of the dissolution process in controlling the concentration of these components component planes cannot provide an accurate and comprehensive interpretation of the hydrogeochemical state of the area and therefore their information must be combined optimal data clustering is one of the most important steps to be taken to reduce the size of the data set and find patterns based on maximum similarity k means clustering is a complementary tool that can statistically place samples in the optimal number of clusters this is based on the quantitative dbi index and can help to better interpret the component planes produced by som in this study the dbi value for wet and dry season data sets is calculated fig 5 in general the number of clusters can vary between 2 and the total number of nodes nguyen et al 2015 thus according to the number of som nodes the maximum theoretical clusters for wet and dry seasons are 50 and 40 respectively however the results show that the minimum value of dbi optimal number of clusters in both seasons is 7 examination of the outputs showed that no sample was placed in one of the clusters designated for the dry season therefore by merging it with other clusters the number of final clusters was reduced to 6 fig 5 right the som matrix prepared for the wet season fig 6 a shows that most of the samples are in 3 clusters including cluster 1 32 samples 38 cluster 3 19 samples 22 62 and cluster 4 14 samples 16 67 respectively other samples are located in cluster 7 9 samples 10 71 cluster 6 4 samples 4 76 and clusters 2 and 5 each with 3 samples and 3 57 the dendrograms of the designated clusters also clearly show the correlation between clusters 1 3 and 4 meanwhile the other 4 clusters with about 25 of the total samples also have a high correlation fig 6c on the other hand most of the samples in the som matrix prepared for the dry season fig 6b are placed in clusters 1 18 samples 31 03 cluster 3 15 samples 25 86 and cluster 6 10 samples 17 24 respectively other samples are placed in cluster 4 9 samples 15 52 cluster 5 4 samples 6 90 and cluster 2 2 samples 2 45 respectively the determined dendrogram also shows a high correlation between clusters 2 and 6 fig 6d examination of the position of the samples of these two clusters shows that their equivalents in the wet season are clusters 6 and 7 as mentioned before the changes in the chemical composition of these samples are more than in other parts of the aquifer other clusters including cluster 1 cluster 3 cluster 4 and cluster 5 also have high correlations seasonal variation is one of the factors that can change the chemical composition of samples as well as change the correlation between them and different clusters the positions and corresponding clusters of duplicate samples in the dry season are separated in table 5 in other words the displacement of these samples between different clusters is presented as a function of seasonal change the results show that the duplicate samples of cluster 1 wet season are mainly located in clusters 3 and 4 dry season as shown in fig 6d these two clusters have the highest correlation and are somewhat equivalent to cluster 1 in the wet season on the other hand three other samples are located in clusters 1 and 6 which according to fig 6d the correlation of cluster 1 with two clusters 3 and 4 can also rule out the role of seasonal changes in changing their chemical composition thus only one example is likely to be affected by temporal changes of course amiri et al 2016b 2016c also showed that except in some places seasonal changes can not cause significant changes in the chemical composition of groundwater resources of this aquifer all samples of cluster 2 wet season in the dry season are also placed in cluster 6 almost similar conditions can be seen in cluster 3 wet season the results show that about 82 of the duplicate samples of this cluster in the dry season are placed in cluster 1 in other words these two clusters are equivalent to each other in wet and dry seasons similarly the samples located in clusters 4 and 5 wet season are distributed in 5 and 3 different clusters respectively it seems that considering that many of these samples are located at the closest distance to the shoreline and are also close to perennial rivers the change of seasons can cause a change in the chemical composition of the 6 samples of these clusters the samples of clusters 6 and 7 wet season are also located in clusters 2 and 6 the position of different clusters in both wet and dry seasons can show the relationship between them fig 7 in the wet season clusters 7 6 2 and 5 and equivalent clusters in the dry season seem to have the most differences with the main water body of this aquifer in other words changes due to water rock interaction as well as some pollutants produced by human activities can change the natural chemical composition of groundwater in these clusters examining the changes in physicochemical components in different clusters can help to better understand the hydrogeochemical conditions changes in the normalized concentrations of the 24 variables used in the wet season indicate that the 32 samples in cluster 1 have high concentrations of ca hco3 no3 and b fig 8 dissolution of carbonates e g limestone is one of the most important factors in increasing ca and hco3 in addition agricultural activities in the area and the use of fertilizers effluent leakage as well as natural processes such as ammonia oxidation can cause no3 concentration amiri et al 2021c nakhaei et al 2015 most samples of this cluster are freshwater see fig 2 and usually the concentration of b in such water bodies is high vinson 2011 however by changing the chemical type of water from ca hco3 co3 to other types such as na hco3 co3 and increasing the amount of ec the concentration of b is expected to increase as well vengosh et al 2005 such conditions can be observed in cluster 3 and to some extent cluster 4 which is to be expected due to their high correlation fig 6c cluster 1 in the dry season also follows a similar trend fig 9 cluster 2 has high normalized concentrations of ca and f fig 8 the correlation between these two components can indicate the role of geogenic factors in increasing the concentration of these elements in water samples amiri and berndtsson 2020 showed that some samples close to rock formations especially volcanic rocks have high concentrations of fluoride however the highest f concentrations have been recorded mainly in shallow water which may be due to anthropogenic activities such as agricultural fertilizers the high concentrations of no3 and so4 in the samples of this cluster can also confirm this claim fig 8 as shown in fig 6c the geochemical status of the water samples in cluster 7 has a similar interpretation the samples in cluster 4 have high concentrations of ba b and mg fig 8 amiri et al 2017 showed that the increase in ba concentration in some places especially in the shallow water is due to the dissolution of fe oxides in reducing conditions however the concentration of ba except in some places is mainly low and this is due to the low solubility of barite as the most important source of ba in groundwater and low mobility of ba due to the formation of insoluble salts nordberg et al 2014 the moderate correlation between ba and hco3 can indicate the role of freshwater geochemistry in increasing their concentration fig 8 the samples in cluster 5 in wet season and cluster 2 in dry season have moderate concentrations of most of the studied variables in wet and dry seasons respectively and it seems that different geogenic and anthropogenic factors should be responsible for controlling their chemical composition figs 8 and 9 the samples in cluster 6 have high concentrations of different variables such as u zn sr rb ba as al and br fig 8 also there is a strong correlation between these variables with na cl and tds the three samples located in this cluster are located at the closest distance to ul and also have a short distance to the rock formations containing the mentioned metals on the other hand the correlation of ba with tds and ec may be due to the non conservative behavior of ba as has also been reported by amiri et al 2017 changes in physicochemical components for the dry season indicate that samples of clusters 3 and 4 have moderate to high concentrations of no3 and as fig 9 the presence of these parameters indicates the role of anthropogenic factors such as agricultural activities selck 2016 barringer and reilly 2013 showed that agricultural activities can change the geochemical behavior of as as a function of oxidation reduction potential orp the strong correlation of as with eh also refers to this process fig 9 in addition the chemical composition of rocks in this area indicates that water rock interaction can also release as into groundwater sohrabi et al 2021 the correlations of clusters 3 4 and 5 are also shown in fig 6d therefore it can be expected that the pattern of change in physicochemical variables of these clusters is almost similar cluster 6 has similarities such as no3 and as correlations with clusters 3 4 and 5 however as mentioned this cluster is equivalent to cluster 7 in the wet season the high concentrations of ca so4 f ba and si and their correlation with ec and tds indicate the role of geogenic factors in controlling these components fig 9 3 3 comparison of som and pca pca results using 24 selected physicochemical variables show that about 73 and 72 of the chemical changes of wet and dry data sets can be examined by 5 principal components or factor f respectively table 6 these factors have been identified based on eigenvalues greater than 1 alvarez guerra et al 2008 for both seasons the first two factors after the varimax rotation kaiser normalization can control about 53 and 52 of the hydrochemical changes respectively accordingly the scatter plot of loadings of physicochemical variables for f1 and f2 is shown in fig 10 a b the results show a positive correlation of most variables in both seasons this relationship is mainly seen for the dry season however ba and as have different behaviors that can to some extent indicate the role of acidity and also eh in controlling these variables scatter plot of scores of water samples for f1 and f2 shows that the results of som clustering in wet and dry seasons can be identified with good accuracy fig 10c d for example similar to fig 6c clusters 3 and 4 are mostly characterized by negative scores of f2 also similar to fig 6d clusters 1 3 and 5 are mainly represented by negative scores of f2 however these clusters overlap in some places which can make them difficult to interpret in situations where only pca is used to cluster the samples thus som can lead to more detailed clustering or classification which is in good agreement with the findings of some other studies e g subida et al 2013 li et al 2018 4 conclusion in this study the capability of three models 7 hlr 7 m conc and greater molar conc in determining the water types has been investigated the results show that ca hco3 na cl and na hco3 and ca hco3 na hco3 and na cl are the three dominant water types for the wet and dry seasons respectively the results of 7 hlr basic hybrid model as the optimum option that show 42 and 27 water types can be identified for wet and dry seasons respectively the results show that due to the ability of 7 hlr basic model and hfe diagram to identify 16 chemical classes of water they provided almost the same classification twenty four physicochemical components have been used for the hydrogeochemical study of selected water resources based on som method the k means clustering tool detected 7 and 6 clusters using the dbi for the wet and dry seasons respectively radar diagrams of physicochemical variables showed some changes in the groundwater chemistry in some locations due to natural and anthropogenic factors pca results using 24 selected physicochemical variables show that about 72 of the chemical changes in both seasons can be explained by 5 principal components for both seasons the first two factors after the varimax rotation can control about 53 and 52 of the hydrochemical changes respectively comparison of som and pca shows that both methods can perform clustering of samples correctly however the som method provides more accurate clustering without any overlap between different clusters credit authorship contribution statement vahab amiri conceptualization methodology resources software writing original

3929,in this study a linear discriminant analysis lda based nomenclature system have been used for the classification of groundwater samples in a coastal aquifer the capability of three models 7 hlr 7 m conc and greater molar conc in determining the water types has been investigated the results show that ca hco3 na cl and na hco3 and ca hco3 na hco3 and na cl are the three dominant water types for the wet and dry seasons respectively the results of 7 hlr basic hybrid model as the best option show that 42 and 27 water types can be identified for wet and dry seasons respectively twenty four physicochemical components have been used for the hydrogeochemical study of selected water resources based on kohonen s self organizing map som method the k means clustering tool detected 7 and 6 clusters using the davies bouldin index dbi for the wet and dry seasons respectively hydrogeochemical assessment of duplicated samples showed that the seasonal changes can not cause significant changes in the chemical composition of groundwater resources of this aquifer radar diagrams of physicochemical variables showed some changes in the chemical composition of groundwater in some locations due to water rock interaction as well as pollutants produced by human activities comparison of the results of classification of water samples by som and principal component analysis pca shows that both methods can perform clustering of samples correctly however the som method provides more accurate clustering without any overlap between different clusters keywords groundwater classification linear discriminant analysis self organizing maps k means clustering principal component analysis coastal aquifer 1 introduction many people around the world live in coastal areas and their lives depend on available natural resources such as access to water population growth and increased human activities have caused the production of various pollutants and this along with climate change has exacerbated adverse conditions in such areas khan et al 2021a 2021b continuation of these conditions can lead to environmental degradation endangering living organisms and human health li et al 2018 shukla and saxena 2020 2021 wang et al 2020 sohrabi et al 2021 therefore it seems that urgent measures should be taken to manage and protect groundwater resources exposed to pollution especially in arid and semi arid coastal areas facing groundwater scarcity amiri et al 2021a 2021b wu et al 2021 hydrogeochemical assessment and spatiotemporal determination of groundwater chemical type can help identify the potential for sustainable development in these areas and prevent adverse health consequences in the future wu et al 2017 li et al 2021 numerous researchers have attempted to classify water samples using a variety of methods e g hill 1940 piper 1944 romani 1981 chadha 1999 güler et al 2002 gimenez forcada 2010 perez espinosa et al 2019 in many of these endeavors appropriate computer programs are also provided the hill piper classification method which can identify 5 general types of water has been used in many studies as an ideal method for determining the quality and chemical type of water the researchers tried to optimize the structure of the hill piper diagram to improve its performance in identifying the further water types for example durov 1948 used a rectangular field to represent water types subsequently stiff 1951 attempted to provide a schematic pattern of changes in the concentration of major ions in water samples handa 1965 also proposed a water division system for irrigation taking into account the salinity of water in addition to the major ions lioyd 1965 also presented an improved version of durov diagrams after the studies mentioned the researchers tried to consider more parameters for classifying water samples e g kemp 1971 in this regard d amore et al 1983 and stuyfzand 1989 also focused on improving methods and diagrams one of the most important shortcomings of the discussed methods especially in identifying the mechanisms controlling the chemical composition of water is considering the linear trend for mixing waters of different qualities e g saline water and freshwater verma et al 2021 for example groundwater mixing ratios are a function of various hydrogeochemical processes such as carbonate dissolution cation exchange and redox potential in addition in the hill piper method and its other modifications no clear boundaries between different types of water can be identified and they are mostly overlapping haselbeck et al 2019 therefore it seems that accurate identification and analysis of these complex hydrogeochemical mechanisms requires the use of the most robust methods such as log ratio transformations not conventional methods based on ternary diagrams verma 2015 2020 the log ratio transformation method has already been used by shelton et al 2018 however similar to ternary diagrams they use the sum of na and k as well as hco3 and co3 in the analyzes verma et al 2021 believed that there was no geochemical reason for using a combination of these cations and anions in other words to identify the exact mechanism of change in the chemical composition of water in an aquifer small changes must be examined which means identifying more water types using hybrid log ratios of the molar concentration of major 8 ions through linear discriminant analysis lda can lead to much more detailed results than other available methods verma et al 2021 despite the ability of this method to distinguish different types of water it should be noted that it is based only on 4 cations and 4 anions therefore to study the hydrogeochemical conditions and analyze the natural and human factors in changing the water quality more chemical components should be considered on the other hand providing accurate and reliable interpretation as well as identifying patterns and complex relationships between different types of water requires reducing the size of the data and their clustering li et al 2018 clark et al 2020 multivariate approaches such as principal component analysis pca hierarchical cluster analysis hca discriminant analysis da and self organizing maps som are among the most widely used tools for assessing spatiotemporal changes in groundwater chemical composition wu et al 2014 2019 li et al 2019 amiri et al 2017 nakagawa et al 2020 santos et al 2020 some studies have shown that in complex data sets with abundant physicochemical components it is impossible to determine the exact correlation between parameters and their classification simultaneously by hca and pca approaches choi et al 2014 qu et al 2021 however r mode and q mode hca can provide better results compared to pca because in nonlinear problems the pca method cannot place samples in appropriate clusters haselbeck et al 2019 in contrast som kohonen 1982 1990 kohonen et al 2001 as an artificial intelligence network can provide better results in complex and linear problems astel et al 2007 because the results of this method are not affected by errors noise due to sampling process and laboratory measurements in addition the presence of outliers in complex high dimensional datasets that are found in many contaminated aquifers with different land uses cannot cause errors in the results li et al 2018 clark et al 2020 santos et al 2020 qu et al 2021 in this method high dimensional datasets are converted onto a two dimensional network of nodes based on the dissimilarity of the samples this representation known as component planes is done by maintaining the original topological relationship of the input data component planes can be generated for each of the variables and thus it is possible to compare them node by node wu et al 2021 in addition k means clustering can be used to determine the similarity between different samples and nodes as well as the optimal number of clusters brentan et al 2018 santos et al 2020 due to the high capabilities of the som method it has been used in sciences such as hydrology wallner et al 2013 farsadnia et al 2014 meteorology nishiyama et al 2007 duviver et al 2016 and soil quality rivera et al 2015 this method can also be a powerful tool for analyzing hydrogeological data such as groundwater level changes nourani et al 2016 wunsch et al 2018 nakagawa et al 2019 and groundwater quality classification nguyen et al 2015 nakagawa et al 2017 he et al 2019 he and wu 2019 lee et al 2019 kim et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 in this study a lda based nomenclature system has been used to classify the groundwater samples in addition the results are compared with the results of classification based on greater molar concentration then a combination of som and k means methods have been used to study the spatiotemporal changes of groundwater and to identify the relationships between physicochemical components in the coastal aquifer of urmia northwestern iran also the pca method has been used to interpret the relationships between different clusters and the role of natural and anthropogenic factors in controlling the chemical composition of groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area urmia aquifer is located in the west of the urmia lake ul northwest of iran this alluvial aquifer with an area of about 750 km2 is known as the most important source of water supply for various uses of drinking agriculture and industry fig 1 this highly heterogeneous aquifer is composed of sediments of different sizes the maximum thickness of this aquifer in the northern and southern parts is about 160 to 130 m respectively amiri et al 2021c according to the topography of this region the direction of groundwater flow is from west to east adjacent to ul the aquifer is surrounded by sedimentary such as limestone sandstone conglomerate igneous such as granite gabbro basalt and metamorphic such as gneiss quartzite and marble rocks from precambrian to tertiary supplementary fig s1 sohrabi et al 2017 the existence of mineral reserves in some igneous and metamorphic formations has led to the development of mining activities in some areas this aquifer is directly recharged by mediterranean climatic currents the average long term rainfall is about 346 mm sohrabi et al 2021 which is about 60 mm more than the average rainfall in iran as an arid and semi arid region however high population density development of agricultural activities industrial activities as well as reduced rainfall rates have caused the water resources of this area to be under additional stress also the activity of more than 18 000 authorized wells and 25 000 unauthorized wells has caused the groundwater abstraction rate to increase and be uncontrollable all of these conditions lead to a nearly 540 cm decrease in groundwater level over the past 34 years amiri et al 2021d 2 2 sample collection and analysis in this study 84 and 58 groundwater samples were collected in the wet and dry seasons respectively to determine the spatial variation of groundwater quality the second sampling period was repeated at 58 points these samples have a good distribution in the coastal areas and can provide groundwater quality changes without a significant gap samples were collected according to recommended procedures apha 1985 iso 5667 11 1993 and from production wells with depths between 10 and 120 m to provide fresh water and avoid errors in the results due to stagnant water and well storage the samples were pumped after at least a few tens of minutes and prepared directly from the well outlet at each sampling point two 250 ml pet bottles were stored after passing through a 0 45 μm filter the water of one of these bottles was acidified by adding ultra pure nitric acid ph 2 and used to determine the concentration of cations and metal components another non acidified bottle was taken to the laboratory to determine the concentration of anions before delivering the samples to the laboratory they were kept at 4 c in this study the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms method was used to determine the concentration of calcium ca magnesium mg potassium k sodium na arsenic as boron b aluminum al barium ba rubidium rb silica si uranium u zinc zn strontium sr ph titration with h2so4 to measure carbonate co3 and bicarbonate hco3 concentration ion chromatography to determine the concentration of bromide br and fluoride f aquakem discrete analyzer to detect the concentration of chloride cl and sulfate so4 and a spectrophotometer was used to measure the concentration of nitrate no3 some parameters including ec tds ph and eh are also measured onsite using a portable hach multimeter a statistical summary of the results of the chemical analysis of water samples in both wet and dry seasons is presented in table 1 2 3 water molar classification system from lda this method uses the concentration of 4 major cations ca na mg and k and 4 major anions hco3 co3 so4 and cl and includes three models 7 hybrid log ratio 7 hlr 7 m concentration 7 m conc and greater molar concentration greater molar conc first using the concept of the greater molar concentration known as the greater molar conc model 16 main types of water is determined the main idea of this proposed classification method is the independence of 4 major cations and 4 major anions from each other then 7 hybrid log ratio hlr2 hlr8 was used for linear discriminant analysis and determination of 16 discriminant functions in the 7 hlr model the hlr calculation for each sample is determined using the following equation verma et al 2021 1 hl r i 1 ln g e e i 1 where ge represents the geometric mean of the 8 major ions and e represents the chemical component in this way seven hlr 7 hlr can be set for example 2 hl r 2 ln c a m g n a k s o 4 c l h c o 3 c o 3 1 8 mg the lda uses discriminant functions as follows 3 d f α h τ h c 2 h l r 2 h c 3 h l r 3 h c 4 h l r 4 h c 5 h l r 5 h c 6 h l r 6 h c 7 h l r 7 h c 8 h l r 8 h c 0 where α is 1 or 2 τ represents the type of diagram h represents hlr and hc are the empirical coefficients which are presented by verma et al 2021 after applying the discriminant functions of the 7 hlr model and determining the cation and anion probabilities and comparing them the final decision of the 7 hlr model can be obtained the obtained results will be available in two basic i e selection of the final cation and anion and basic hybrid i e two major cations and two major anions it should be noted that the basic hybrid option can identify up to 256 water types lda is performed without any log transformation on the molar concentrations of the chemical components and this model is known as 7 m conc model to determine the water type using the 7 m conc model the discriminant functions of the 7 m conc model should also be applied in this method after calculating the cation and anion probabilities and comparison of probabilities the water type can be determined based on the 7 m conc model method in this model as in the 7 hlr model the lda uses the following discriminant functions 4 d f α m τ m c 2 m c e l e m 2 m c 3 m c e l e m 3 m c 4 m c e l e m 4 m c 5 m c e l e m 5 m c 6 m c e l e m 6 m c 7 m c e l e m 7 m c 8 m c e l e m 8 m c 0 where α is 1 or 2 τ represents the type of diagram mcelem represents molar concentration and mc are the empirical coefficients which are presented by verma et al 2021 in these three models after determining the water type of the original samples robustness and uncertainty of classifications are examined for this purpose 2200 new compositions are simulated based on the original data set using the monte carlo simulation procedure then with the same method the water type of this synthetic data set is determined again in this way these results can be compared with the results of the classification original data set and their accuracy can be evaluated details of this method can be found in verma et al 2021 and verma 2020 in this study an online computer program watermclasys lda http tlaloc ier unam mx was used to run the 7 hlr 7 m conc and greater molar conc models 2 4 self organizing map som som as an artificial neural network can reduce the dimensions of high dimensional data sets based on similarities and turn them into a two dimensional structure jin et al 2011 the main purpose of this method is to identify reference also weight or prototype vectors through an iterative process in the training phase nguyen et al 2015 the som training algorithm uses the euclidean distance between the concentrations of chemical components as input vectors haselbeck et al 2019 in general the steps of creating a som include i designing and constructing an input data matrix ii initial data processing including standardization normalization and transformation iii designing a som structure including calculating the number of nodes and their configuration iv selection of a right initializing method v proper som training and vi display of samples on a map based on their degree of matching with the nearest node clark et al 2020 the accuracy of som results is a function of the number of map nodes accordingly small maps may not detect some patterns in the data set cereghino and park 2009 on the other hand the larger size of the som increases the model s ability to identify patterns in the data set structure liu et al 2006 nguyen et al 2015 however in large maps some nodes may be empty and no water sample may match them this means that the patterns identified by these nodes do not actually exist in the data set kohonen 2013 clark et al 2017 2020 a quick and easy way to determine the size number of nodes of a map is to use thumb or heuristics rules according to the most widely used method the number of nodes should be approximately equal to 5 number of samples nakagawa et al 2020 after the training process and determination of reference vectors clustering can be done using existing methods there are various clustering methods one of the most important and widely used for som is the k means algorithm li et al 2018 clark et al 2020 the optimal number of clusters can be determined based on the k means method and using the davies bouldin index dbi since this index provides the average similarity between clusters its lowest value indicates the highest dissimilarity between clusters and is considered as the number of optimal clusters santos et al 2020 another effective way to determine clusters is to use within cluster sum of squares wcss which works by finding a point called elbow point haselbeck et al 2019 complementing this method is the use of the silhouette coefficient in this study calculations and visualization of som were performed using the som toolbox in matlab 5 vesanto et al 2000 3 results and discussion 3 1 lda based nomenclature of water one of the most important steps to be taken for water classification using the lda method is to convert the concentrations from mg l to meq l and then to meq l to mmol l supplementary tables s1 and s4 provide a statistical summary of the original and simulated data sets in the wet and dry seasons respectively the results show that the minimum maximum average and standard deviation of the original and simulated data sets are very close to each other in this study the capability of three models 7 hlr 7 m conc and greater molar conc in determining the water types has been investigated in the first attempt the water types for both wet and dry seasons are determined based on the classic greater molar conc model tables 2 and 3 these results have been used for examining the degree of compatibility of the other two methods the results show that ca hco3 na cl and na hco3 and ca hco3 na hco3 and na cl are the three dominant water types for the wet and dry seasons respectively thus na appears to be the predominant cation in more than 50 of the samples similar results by amiri et al 2016c have been reported in a study aimed at investigating the possible impact of ul on the chemical composition of groundwater using hydrochemical facies evolution hfe diagram gimenez forcada 2010 it should be noted that the hfe diagram can also identify 16 water types which in this respect works similar to the 7 hlr basic model therefore the similarity of the results of these two approaches is to be expected the lda approach is used to determine the water type using 7 hlr and 7 m conc models before that for the 7 hlr model the values hlr2 hlr8 must be determined and then used to prepare df1hτ and df2hτ for different cations and anions in this study after calculating the values of hlr2 hlr8 supplementary table s5 and s6 the values of df1h and df2h for 4 groups of cations including mg na and k ca mg and na ca mg and k and finally ca na and k were prepared for both wet and dry seasons in addition the values of df1h and df2h for 4 classes of anions also include so4 cl and hco3 so4 cl and co3 so4 hco3 and co3 and finally cl hco3 and co3 are prepared for both wet and dry seasons supplementary figs s2 and s3 it should be noted that after calculating hlrs and df1hτ and df2hτ based on the original data set these calculations are also done for the simulated data set based on the monte carlo simulation law and kelton 2000 verma and quiroz ruiz 2006 for evaluating the uncertainty of results supplementary figs s4 and s5 the results clearly show that the types determined based on the 7 hlr model for both wet and dry seasons are very similar to those determined by the greater molar conc model in general 10 and 8 general water types have been identified for water samples in the wet and dry seasons respectively these results are based on the 7 hlr basic model and as expected this option can determine up to 16 water types using 8 main ions due to the high similarity of the results of the 7 hlr basic model with the greater molar conc model it seems that it can be introduced as the optimal model verma et al 2021 have reported similar results however the 7 hlr basic hybrid model is capable of identifying 256 water types it should be noted that this model also uses 8 major ions with the difference that up to two main cations and two anions can be introduced for each water type accordingly table 4 presents the results of the nomenclature of water samples the results show that 42 and 27 water types can be identified for wet and dry seasons respectively the lower number of identified water types for the dry season may be due to the smaller size of the data set compared to the wet season the number of water types determined based on the 7 hlr method basic hybrid in the simulated data set also shows that 84 and 55 water types can be identified for wet and dry seasons respectively supplementary tables s7 and s8 according to the results presented in tables 2 and 3 and the comparison of all three naming models the results of 7 m conc model are more different from the other two models therefore the classification results of the original and the simulated data sets by 7 m conc model for wet and dry seasons are presented in supplementary tables s9 s12 in addition the classification results for simulated data set by the greater molar conc model in both seasons are presented in supplementary tables s13 s16 details of classification and water types determined by different models are also provided in supplementary tables s17 and s18 as mentioned earlier the results of the water nomenclature by 7 hlr basic model are very similar to the greater molar conc model 7 hlr basic hybrid option can provide better conditions for interpretation of hydrogeochemical status and the reactions that sometimes occur between different ions e g cation exchange process as mentioned na and ca are the two dominant cations and hco3 and cl are the two dominant anions in these samples several water types can be identified according to the concentration of these ions therefore according to tables 2 and 3 ca hco3 as the dominance of freshwater na cl as the dominance of saline water and na hco3 as the indicator of the effect of saline water by direct cation exchange are the main water types in this area amiri et al 2016b in addition the presence of some geological compounds containing mg e g dolomite as well as sulfur e g gypsum and the performance of processes such as dedolomitization and dissolution can create other water types containing mg and so4 supplementary fig s1 the position of the main water types identified by the 7 hlr basic model fig 2 shows that the samples commonly known as freshwater ca mg hco3 co3 cover a large part of the study area in contrast samples with na cl composition which are known as saline and unsuitable waters for various uses are mainly found in areas very close to the shore of ul or in the vicinity of rock structures the interaction of water with these rock formations as well as the presence of salty playa near the lake can be the source of cl and na in these samples amiri et al 2017 the na hco3 na co3 and na so4 water types which have been identified in many samples also indicate the replacement of ca mg and na through the direct cation exchange process on the other hand the ca cl type also indicates the mechanism of reverse cation exchange in other words these samples have a cation similar to freshwaters but their anion is similar to saline water these samples are also in the middle of the path from freshwaters to saline waters performance of ion exchange process and enrichment or depletion of some cations in some water samples in this part of the aquifer is described by amiri et al 2016a 2016b 3 2 clustering of samples by som in this study 24 physicochemical components table 1 have been used for the hydrogeochemical study of groundwater data sets based on the som method accordingly the number of som computational nodes which is a function of data set size for wet and dry seasons was about 48 and 38 respectively thus to prevent the loss of some data the final size of som nodes in these two seasons was considered to be 50 and 40 respectively the component planes of the 24 physicochemical variables for the wet and dry seasons are shown in figs 3 and 4 respectively as shown in fig 3 some components such as ec tds cl mg k co3 hco3 rb b and br have strong positive correlations a strong positive correlation can also be observed between sr so4 no3 and ca the correlation between ca and so4 refers to the role of geogenic factors such as gypsum and anhydrite dissolution in this case the role of anthropogenic factors such as agricultural activities and leakage of domestic and industrial wastewater in increasing the concentration of these components especially no3 should be considered amiri et al 2016c the moderate correlation between ca and f can also indicate the role of the dissolution of minerals containing these two elements such as fluorite caf2 in increasing their concentration in water sources given the distribution of geological formations and their chemical composition in this region a strong positive correlation between al and as also indicates their common geological origin sohrabi et al 2021 some other elements such as u and br also have moderate correlation which can be a function of different processes due to the overlap with other components for example sohrabi et al 2018 and amiri et al 2017 showed that the highest u concentration was recorded near igneous rocks they also cited factors such as the desorption of u from the surface of fe containing minerals and clay minerals as mechanisms for controlling u concentration as shown in fig 4 similar to what was previously said for the physicochemical components of the wet season data set some obvious relationships can also be observed between the physicochemical components in the dry season data set in this case there is a strong correlation between ec and tds with the major ions including cl na mg k as well as some variables including ba and rb also the strong positive correlation of co3 ca and so4 indicates the role of the dissolution process in controlling the concentration of these components component planes cannot provide an accurate and comprehensive interpretation of the hydrogeochemical state of the area and therefore their information must be combined optimal data clustering is one of the most important steps to be taken to reduce the size of the data set and find patterns based on maximum similarity k means clustering is a complementary tool that can statistically place samples in the optimal number of clusters this is based on the quantitative dbi index and can help to better interpret the component planes produced by som in this study the dbi value for wet and dry season data sets is calculated fig 5 in general the number of clusters can vary between 2 and the total number of nodes nguyen et al 2015 thus according to the number of som nodes the maximum theoretical clusters for wet and dry seasons are 50 and 40 respectively however the results show that the minimum value of dbi optimal number of clusters in both seasons is 7 examination of the outputs showed that no sample was placed in one of the clusters designated for the dry season therefore by merging it with other clusters the number of final clusters was reduced to 6 fig 5 right the som matrix prepared for the wet season fig 6 a shows that most of the samples are in 3 clusters including cluster 1 32 samples 38 cluster 3 19 samples 22 62 and cluster 4 14 samples 16 67 respectively other samples are located in cluster 7 9 samples 10 71 cluster 6 4 samples 4 76 and clusters 2 and 5 each with 3 samples and 3 57 the dendrograms of the designated clusters also clearly show the correlation between clusters 1 3 and 4 meanwhile the other 4 clusters with about 25 of the total samples also have a high correlation fig 6c on the other hand most of the samples in the som matrix prepared for the dry season fig 6b are placed in clusters 1 18 samples 31 03 cluster 3 15 samples 25 86 and cluster 6 10 samples 17 24 respectively other samples are placed in cluster 4 9 samples 15 52 cluster 5 4 samples 6 90 and cluster 2 2 samples 2 45 respectively the determined dendrogram also shows a high correlation between clusters 2 and 6 fig 6d examination of the position of the samples of these two clusters shows that their equivalents in the wet season are clusters 6 and 7 as mentioned before the changes in the chemical composition of these samples are more than in other parts of the aquifer other clusters including cluster 1 cluster 3 cluster 4 and cluster 5 also have high correlations seasonal variation is one of the factors that can change the chemical composition of samples as well as change the correlation between them and different clusters the positions and corresponding clusters of duplicate samples in the dry season are separated in table 5 in other words the displacement of these samples between different clusters is presented as a function of seasonal change the results show that the duplicate samples of cluster 1 wet season are mainly located in clusters 3 and 4 dry season as shown in fig 6d these two clusters have the highest correlation and are somewhat equivalent to cluster 1 in the wet season on the other hand three other samples are located in clusters 1 and 6 which according to fig 6d the correlation of cluster 1 with two clusters 3 and 4 can also rule out the role of seasonal changes in changing their chemical composition thus only one example is likely to be affected by temporal changes of course amiri et al 2016b 2016c also showed that except in some places seasonal changes can not cause significant changes in the chemical composition of groundwater resources of this aquifer all samples of cluster 2 wet season in the dry season are also placed in cluster 6 almost similar conditions can be seen in cluster 3 wet season the results show that about 82 of the duplicate samples of this cluster in the dry season are placed in cluster 1 in other words these two clusters are equivalent to each other in wet and dry seasons similarly the samples located in clusters 4 and 5 wet season are distributed in 5 and 3 different clusters respectively it seems that considering that many of these samples are located at the closest distance to the shoreline and are also close to perennial rivers the change of seasons can cause a change in the chemical composition of the 6 samples of these clusters the samples of clusters 6 and 7 wet season are also located in clusters 2 and 6 the position of different clusters in both wet and dry seasons can show the relationship between them fig 7 in the wet season clusters 7 6 2 and 5 and equivalent clusters in the dry season seem to have the most differences with the main water body of this aquifer in other words changes due to water rock interaction as well as some pollutants produced by human activities can change the natural chemical composition of groundwater in these clusters examining the changes in physicochemical components in different clusters can help to better understand the hydrogeochemical conditions changes in the normalized concentrations of the 24 variables used in the wet season indicate that the 32 samples in cluster 1 have high concentrations of ca hco3 no3 and b fig 8 dissolution of carbonates e g limestone is one of the most important factors in increasing ca and hco3 in addition agricultural activities in the area and the use of fertilizers effluent leakage as well as natural processes such as ammonia oxidation can cause no3 concentration amiri et al 2021c nakhaei et al 2015 most samples of this cluster are freshwater see fig 2 and usually the concentration of b in such water bodies is high vinson 2011 however by changing the chemical type of water from ca hco3 co3 to other types such as na hco3 co3 and increasing the amount of ec the concentration of b is expected to increase as well vengosh et al 2005 such conditions can be observed in cluster 3 and to some extent cluster 4 which is to be expected due to their high correlation fig 6c cluster 1 in the dry season also follows a similar trend fig 9 cluster 2 has high normalized concentrations of ca and f fig 8 the correlation between these two components can indicate the role of geogenic factors in increasing the concentration of these elements in water samples amiri and berndtsson 2020 showed that some samples close to rock formations especially volcanic rocks have high concentrations of fluoride however the highest f concentrations have been recorded mainly in shallow water which may be due to anthropogenic activities such as agricultural fertilizers the high concentrations of no3 and so4 in the samples of this cluster can also confirm this claim fig 8 as shown in fig 6c the geochemical status of the water samples in cluster 7 has a similar interpretation the samples in cluster 4 have high concentrations of ba b and mg fig 8 amiri et al 2017 showed that the increase in ba concentration in some places especially in the shallow water is due to the dissolution of fe oxides in reducing conditions however the concentration of ba except in some places is mainly low and this is due to the low solubility of barite as the most important source of ba in groundwater and low mobility of ba due to the formation of insoluble salts nordberg et al 2014 the moderate correlation between ba and hco3 can indicate the role of freshwater geochemistry in increasing their concentration fig 8 the samples in cluster 5 in wet season and cluster 2 in dry season have moderate concentrations of most of the studied variables in wet and dry seasons respectively and it seems that different geogenic and anthropogenic factors should be responsible for controlling their chemical composition figs 8 and 9 the samples in cluster 6 have high concentrations of different variables such as u zn sr rb ba as al and br fig 8 also there is a strong correlation between these variables with na cl and tds the three samples located in this cluster are located at the closest distance to ul and also have a short distance to the rock formations containing the mentioned metals on the other hand the correlation of ba with tds and ec may be due to the non conservative behavior of ba as has also been reported by amiri et al 2017 changes in physicochemical components for the dry season indicate that samples of clusters 3 and 4 have moderate to high concentrations of no3 and as fig 9 the presence of these parameters indicates the role of anthropogenic factors such as agricultural activities selck 2016 barringer and reilly 2013 showed that agricultural activities can change the geochemical behavior of as as a function of oxidation reduction potential orp the strong correlation of as with eh also refers to this process fig 9 in addition the chemical composition of rocks in this area indicates that water rock interaction can also release as into groundwater sohrabi et al 2021 the correlations of clusters 3 4 and 5 are also shown in fig 6d therefore it can be expected that the pattern of change in physicochemical variables of these clusters is almost similar cluster 6 has similarities such as no3 and as correlations with clusters 3 4 and 5 however as mentioned this cluster is equivalent to cluster 7 in the wet season the high concentrations of ca so4 f ba and si and their correlation with ec and tds indicate the role of geogenic factors in controlling these components fig 9 3 3 comparison of som and pca pca results using 24 selected physicochemical variables show that about 73 and 72 of the chemical changes of wet and dry data sets can be examined by 5 principal components or factor f respectively table 6 these factors have been identified based on eigenvalues greater than 1 alvarez guerra et al 2008 for both seasons the first two factors after the varimax rotation kaiser normalization can control about 53 and 52 of the hydrochemical changes respectively accordingly the scatter plot of loadings of physicochemical variables for f1 and f2 is shown in fig 10 a b the results show a positive correlation of most variables in both seasons this relationship is mainly seen for the dry season however ba and as have different behaviors that can to some extent indicate the role of acidity and also eh in controlling these variables scatter plot of scores of water samples for f1 and f2 shows that the results of som clustering in wet and dry seasons can be identified with good accuracy fig 10c d for example similar to fig 6c clusters 3 and 4 are mostly characterized by negative scores of f2 also similar to fig 6d clusters 1 3 and 5 are mainly represented by negative scores of f2 however these clusters overlap in some places which can make them difficult to interpret in situations where only pca is used to cluster the samples thus som can lead to more detailed clustering or classification which is in good agreement with the findings of some other studies e g subida et al 2013 li et al 2018 4 conclusion in this study the capability of three models 7 hlr 7 m conc and greater molar conc in determining the water types has been investigated the results show that ca hco3 na cl and na hco3 and ca hco3 na hco3 and na cl are the three dominant water types for the wet and dry seasons respectively the results of 7 hlr basic hybrid model as the optimum option that show 42 and 27 water types can be identified for wet and dry seasons respectively the results show that due to the ability of 7 hlr basic model and hfe diagram to identify 16 chemical classes of water they provided almost the same classification twenty four physicochemical components have been used for the hydrogeochemical study of selected water resources based on som method the k means clustering tool detected 7 and 6 clusters using the dbi for the wet and dry seasons respectively radar diagrams of physicochemical variables showed some changes in the groundwater chemistry in some locations due to natural and anthropogenic factors pca results using 24 selected physicochemical variables show that about 72 of the chemical changes in both seasons can be explained by 5 principal components for both seasons the first two factors after the varimax rotation can control about 53 and 52 of the hydrochemical changes respectively comparison of som and pca shows that both methods can perform clustering of samples correctly however the som method provides more accurate clustering without any overlap between different clusters credit authorship contribution statement vahab amiri conceptualization methodology resources software writing original
