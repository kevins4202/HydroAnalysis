namely niit and niat our results demonstrate that both two mof membranes with sub nanosized pores exhibit high performance in terms of water permeability and salt rejection the double layer 2 l niit membrane exhibit a fast water flux of 45 l cm2 mpa day with excellent 100 nacl rejection while for the converted nanosheet niat with a minor structural distinction from niit the water permeability can reach above 70 l cm2 day mpa with still a high salt rejection of 96 2d in plane water density distribution analysis reveals that the improvement of water permeability of the niat membrane can be

neighboring layers to sum up our study provides two promising mof membranes for high efficiency desalination and a prospective approach to achieve the precise control of the separation of water and ions at the nanoscale 2 computational methods 2 1 parameters for molecular dynamics simulations the molecular dynamics md simulations in this work were carried out using the gromacs software package abraham et al 2015 spoel et al 2005 universal force field uff garberoglio 2012 was used in all simulations in this work the spc e water model berweger et al 1995 was adopted for water molecules the atomic charges of niit niat membranes were obtained from the esp fitting by gaussian 09 frisch et al 2009 at the b3lyp 6 31g d level the detailed charge information for the niit niat was shown in fig s1 in the esi the lincs constraints hess 2008 hess et al 1997 were used for all bonds that involved hydrogen long range electrostatic interactions were handled by pme summation darden et al 1993 and the van der waals interactions were treated with a distance cutoff of 12 å a typical simulation box had a dimension of approximately 4 2 nm 4 8 nm 33 nm in x y and z directions about 53 sodium and chloride ions were added in the seawater region corresponding to a salt concentration of 0 4 m according to previous experimental results multilayered mof nanosheets of aa stacking top and bottom layers are completely overlapped with each other with interlayer spacing of 4 2 å are considered in this study sun et al 2017a 2017b the system box was first relaxed by coupling with the nosé hoover thermostat hoover 1985 nosé 2006 at 300 k for 1 ns in the subsequent production run a constant external force 300 1200 kj mol nm corresponding to 25 100 mpa acted on piston 1 while another constant force equivalent to ambient pressure 0 1 mpa acted on piston 2 fig 1 the atomic positions of mof membranes were fixed during the simulation in order to maintain structural integrity 2 2 calculation of potential of mean forces the potential of mean forces pmf for na cl and water passing through niat niit membrane was investigated by the umbrella sampling method torrie and valleau 1977 and the profiles were calculated by wham method kumar et al 1992 the normal direction of the membrane was chosen as the reaction coordinate and the selected molecule water na cl was restrained by a harmonic constraint in this direction the sampling window spanned around 3 nm across the mof membranes at 0 1 nm intervals for each sampling window a 15 ns simulation was carried out under the canonical ensemble to generate enough data 3 results and discussion 3 1 the setup of simulation models the structures of niit and niat mof are shown in fig 1a and b both mofs are composed of the same elements ni s c n and h and share a hexagonal structure except that niat has one more h at each n atom considering the van der waals radius of atoms the effective radius of the pore is estimated to be around 7 3 å for both mofs fig 1c depicts a typical simulation box which consists of two graphene pistons a region of fresh water and a region of seawater 0 4 m nacl separated by the mof materials external pressures p1 and p2 are oppositely applied to the system to stimulate water molecules to flow from the seawater region to the fresh water region through the mofs membrane where p1 from 25 to 100 mpa in various simulations was imposed on piston 1 and p2 0 1 mpa equivalent to ambient pressure on piston 2 therefore a net pressure drop was generated across the mof membrane 3 2 water permeability and salt rejection water flux and salt rejection rate are two indicative factors to evaluate the desalination efficiency of a semipermeable membrane fig 2 a and b shows the number of water molecules permeating through the niat niit membrane during 10 ns simulation at a variety of p1 pressure from 25 to 100 mpa for both niat and niit membranes the number of filtered waters increases proportionally to simulation time at each pressure and moreover the speed of water slope of the curve through the mof membrane increases as the pressure rises obviously water molecules pass through the single layer 1 l membrane slightly faster than the 2 l membrane at the same pressure subsequently the water flux was estimated by calculating the slope of the filtered water number with respect to simulation time as shown in fig 2c and d under the external pressure of 100 mpa the water fluxes of 1 l niat and niit membrane can reach 662 water molecules ns and 538 water molecules ns while those of the 2 l membranes decline slightly 486 water molecules ns for niat and 347 water molecules ns for niit at the same time the 1 l mof membranes exhibit a satisfying salt rejection rate in detail the 1 l niit membrane can prevent 85 nacl even at the high pressure of 100 mpa while for 1 l niat the rejection rate is slightly lower at 80 it should be noted that the addition of a second layer can greatly improve the salt rejection efficiency which can reach 100 for niit and 96 for niat at 100 mpa moreover the linear relationship between the pressure and the water flux indicates a pore flow mechanism of water transport in the niit niat membranes wang et al 2021a this is further confirmed by the water flux results of 3 l to 5 l niit niat membranes under pressure from 25 mpa to 100 mpa shown in fig s2 in the esi to further explore the influence of the number of stacking layers on desalination performance we calculated the water permeability and salt rejection of multilayered 1 5 niit and niat membranes under the external pressure of 50 mpa and the results were summarized in fig 3 for both mofs the 1 l filter exhibits the highest water permeability of 74 l cm2 mpa day for niit and 90 l cm2 mpa day for niat meanwhile the salt rejection ratio reached over 90 the increase of the membrane layers greatly hinders the rapid passage of water molecules for both mof membranes for niit the water permeability gradually decreased with the increase of layers and finally dropped to 25 l cm2 mpa day for the 5 l case for the niat membrane the water permeability is less sensitive to membrane thickness which still maintained a permeability of over 50 l cm2 mpa day for the 5 l membrane which is about twice the value of that of niit meanwhile the increase in membrane thickness enables a remarkable enhancement in ion rejection one can see that niit multilayers 2 l can efficiently block 100 ions while for the niat membranes the salt rejection reaches 99 for 3 l and above it is worth noting that during the preparation of mof membranes microporous defects are inevitably present lu et al 2020 which would largely reduce the salt rejection rate of the membrane therefore multilayer stacked mofs are often utilized in practice to eliminate the effect of defects of the mof membranes furthermore one challenge usually encountered in water filtration based on our simulation model is concentration polarization sablani et al 2001 wang et al 2021a which would impede the high water flux and induce membrane contamination however a cross flow filtration device was often adopted in recent experiments fan et al 2018 liu et al 2019 which significantly reduces the effect of concentration polarization as higher shear force would carry away ions to prevent them from depositing on the membrane surface 3 3 microscopic nature of water density velocity and hydrogen network from the above analyses the niat membrane is less regulated by the membrane thickness albeit with high similarity to the niit structure this might be beneficial for practical applications because the performance of niat membrane will be less affected by the fabrication process to probe the reason for the higher water permeability of niat membrane than niit with similar thickness we further analyzed the density distribution of water oxygen atoms through nanopore of 1 l niit and niat membranes and projected them onto the membrane plane as shown in fig 4 a six intense red regions representing high water probability were detected corresponding to six obvious water channels in the niit nanopores with oxygen atoms pointing to hydrogen atoms at the pore edge in contrast for the niat membrane although six water channels can be identified they are relatively localized in the channel center region which might contribute to the easier passage of water and accordingly the enhanced water flux of niat over niit in the more obvious water channels of the niat membrane a much higher water transport velocity was observed than niit membrane for all types of pore area as summarized in fig 4c more specifically for the niit membrane the water velocity gradually decreases from 5 80 m s to 0 with respect to the distance away from the pore center while for the niat membrane the water velocity decreases from 7 15 m s to 0 it should be noted that the maximum velocity of water reaches as high as 7 15 m s at the pore center of niat membrane which is much larger than previous reports including the ni hab 6 m s porous graphene 4 m s and porous mos2 3 5 m s cao et al 2019 revealing the higher water permeability of the niat membrane in the current study the water transport behavior is highly dependent on the water structure when confined inside the transport channel to characterize the water structure inside the filtration membranes we analyzed the average number of h bonds per water molecule in the pore area in pore and that restricted between two adjacent layers interlayer the results are shown in fig 4d and e as can be seen for both niit and niat most of the water molecules 83 for niit and 77 for niat respectively in the pore area forms 3 or 4 h bonds which is comparable to that of bulk water 3 5 h bonds kumar et al 2007 however for water molecules restricted between two layers only a small ratio of water 33 for niit and 37 for niat forms 3 h bonds and there are about 15 water molecules forming none h bonds with neighboring ones therefore water molecules in the interlayer are more isolated and restricted with a bad structured h bonds network 3 4 water transport resistance analysis to further explore the effect of the stacking patterns of multi layered niit niat membranes on the water permeability we analyzed the transport behavior inside these two multilayered structures computational methods are detailed in esi following previous reports zhang et al 2018b zhou et al 2019 the total transport resistance composed of the interfacial resistance and the interior resistance for both structures are investigated which are illustrated in fig 5 a notable positive correlation is observed between the total transport resistances and the thickness of the multi layered membranes indicating that water molecules pass more slowly through the thicker membranes resulting in the decrease of the water permeability comparing two membranes niat has a smaller transport resistance than niit with the same thickness leading to the higher water permeability of niat this is attributed to the distinct different distribution of the interfacial resistance and the interior resistance of two membranes in detail for the niit membrane the interior resistance raises rapidly with the increase of the layer number and attains to 80 of the total resistance at the 5 l case while for the niat membrane the interior resistance increases much slower with the increase of the layer number and only contributes 53 of the total resistance in the 5 l case these results are in good agreement with the aforementioned water permeability where the performance of niat membrane is less sensitive to the thickness as its interior resistance is less affected by the layer number 3 5 free energy calculations to probe the physical origin of the fast water passage and suppressed ion permeation through the mof membranes the pmf of water na and cl translocating through 1 3 layers of niit niat membranes were explicitly calculated using the umbrella sampling method as can be seen in fig 6 a the free energy barrier of water to pass through the niat membrane is the lowest which is 5 5 kj mol while for ions considerably high energy barriers were detected for na 13 kj mol and cl 18 kj mol we attributed the high barriers to the hard dehydration of salt ions fig s3 in the esi when squeezing through the nanopore for the 2 l mofs membrane as shown in fig 6b the energy barrier for water passing through the niat membranes slightly increased to 6 4 kj mol which is consistent with the lower water permeability for the 2 l niat in the normal simulations moreover a local energy minimum sandwiched by two energy maximums was observed between two layers resulting in a small energy peak of 2 kj mol for water passage for ions the case is similar where the free energy barriers are higher for both na 17 8 kj mol and cl 27 1 kj mol than that in the 1 l case leading to a higher ion rejection rate for the 2 l membrane especially for niat further increasing the layer number to 3 does not affect the energy barriers too much water 6 8 kj mol na 18 kj mol cl 28 1 kj mol as shown in fig 6c however water and ions have to overcome local energy barriers water 2 kj mol na 4 1 kj mol cl 10 kj mol step by step which results in the relatively lower water permeability and higher salt rejection for the multilayered cases as summarized in fig 6d f the water density along the transporting direction is well consistent with the undulation of pmf curves appearing in an obvious negative correlation for the 1 l niat the lowest water density was located in the pore of the membrane corresponding to the energy barrier located at the pore center while two high water density peaks were observed near the membrane consistent with two energy minimums at two sides of the membrane for both the 2 l and 3 l cases a local water density peak can be found between two neighboring layers which is in agreement with the interlayer energy minimum besides pmf profiles for water and ions translocation through niit membranes were summarized in fig s4 in esi where similar trends were observed the niit membrane always imposes stronger regulation on water and ions than niat membrane taking the 3 l niit membrane for example na needs to overcome an additional 2 kj mol to translocate through the nanopore of niit compared to that of niat while for water the situation is the same where the barrier raises to 7 3 kj mol this also supports the higher water flux of niat membrane from the above analyses controlling the thickness of the mof membrane can effectively regulate the energy barriers for water and ion passage increase in membrane thickness makes it more difficult for all molecules to pass through which inevitably slows the water flow meanwhile largely preventing the passage of ions through the mof filters meanwhile the slightly structural distinction between niit and niat would effectively modulate the water permeation and salt rejection of the filter thus in practical applications the performance of the membrane can be well controlled through engineering of the mof structures to reach the balance of considerably high water permeability with a high ion rejection ratio 3 6 comparison between desalination membranes to further demonstrate the high performance of mof membranes we compared the water permeability and ion rejection rate of niit and niat mof membranes with those of previously reported membranes including conventional reverse osmosis membranes e g mfi zeolite and 2d membranes like nanoporous graphene and mos2 cao et al 2019 2020 guillen and hoek 2009 li et al 2004 pendergast and hoek 2011 as shown in fig 7 the 2 l niit mof exhibit excellent salt rejection of 100 and water permeability 45 5 l cm2 mpa day which is about 5 orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional reverse osmosis membranes 5 times higher in magnitude than that of mos2 and graphene but slightly lower than that of 2 l cu hab membrane further thicker niit membranes still exhibited higher performance than most membranes for example a high water permeation of 25 l cm2 mpa day can be obtained for the 5 l niit membrane the water permeability of 2 l niat mof membrane 71 l cm2 mpa day exceeds all the other membranes mentioned above and meanwhile 2 l niat can effectively block 96 nacl for the 5 l niat membrane the water flux can still maintain as high as 50 l cm2 mpa day and the ion rejection increases to 99 therefore niit and niat mofs are two highly competitive candidates for desalination membranes that surely deserve further experimental exploration 4 conclusion to conclude by employing md simulations we theoretically studied the desalination performance of niit and niat mof membranes the water permeability of the 2 l niit mof membrane reaches 45 l cm2 mpa day and complete ion rejection is realized for the 2 l niat mof membrane it has a higher water flux of 71 l cm2 mpa day and prevents 96 nacl passage the in plane water density distribution and transport resistance analyses indicate that the improved water permeation of the niat membrane corresponds to the denser water pack higher water velocity and lower transport resistance through the nanopores of niat furthermore quantitative pmf analysis shows that the free energy barrier of water molecules e g 5 5 kj mol through 1 l niat and 6 4 kj mol through 2 l niat passing through the mof membrane is much lower than that of ion na 13 kj mol and cl 15 8 kj mol through 1 l niat and na 17 8 kj mol and cl 27 kj mol through 2 l niat implying that ions are more difficult to pass through mof membrane than water moreover multilayered membranes slightly suppress the passage of water molecules but are beneficial for the salt blockage this enhanced ion rejection for the multilayered cases is mainly due to the interlayer restriction by neighboring sheets other than the in pore confinement compared to previously reported desalination architectures the mofs membrane demonstrated considerably high performance moreover the water permeability and ion rejection ratio of the mof membrane are adjustable through controlling the mof thickness and fine tuning the structure of the mof membrane offering a possibility for the design of a novel desalination membrane with low energy cost through structural engineering therefore our present study highlights the great potential of niit niat mof membranes as efficient desalination materials which are worth further experimental exploration credit authorship

layers are completely overlapped with each other with interlayer spacing of 4 2 å are considered in this study sun et al 2017a 2017b the system box was first relaxed by coupling with the nosé hoover thermostat hoover 1985 nosé 2006 at 300 k for 1 ns in the subsequent production run a constant external force 300 1200 kj mol nm corresponding to 25 100 mpa acted on piston 1 while another constant force equivalent to ambient pressure 0 1 mpa acted on piston 2 fig 1 the atomic positions of mof membranes were fixed during the simulation in order to maintain structural integrity 2 2 calculation of potential of mean forces the potential of mean forces pmf for na cl and water passing through niat niit membrane was investigated by the umbrella sampling method torrie and valleau 1977 and the profiles were calculated by wham method kumar et al 1992 the normal direction of the membrane was chosen as the reaction coordinate and the selected molecule water na cl was restrained by a harmonic constraint in this direction the sampling window spanned around 3 nm across the mof membranes at 0 1 nm intervals for each sampling window a 15 ns simulation was carried out under the canonical ensemble to generate enough data 3 results and discussion 3 1 the setup of simulation models the structures of niit and niat mof are shown in fig 1a and b both mofs are composed of the same elements ni s c n and h and share a hexagonal structure except that niat has one more h at each n atom considering the van der waals radius of atoms the effective radius of the pore is estimated to be around 7 3 å for both mofs fig 1c depicts a typical simulation box which consists of two graphene pistons a region of fresh water and a region of seawater 0 4 m nacl separated by the mof materials external pressures p1 and p2 are oppositely applied to the system to stimulate water molecules to flow from the seawater region to the fresh water region through the mofs membrane where p1 from 25 to 100 mpa in various simulations was imposed on piston 1 and p2 0 1 mpa equivalent to ambient pressure on piston 2 therefore a net pressure drop was generated across the mof membrane 3 2 water permeability and salt rejection water flux and salt rejection rate are two indicative factors to evaluate the desalination efficiency of a semipermeable membrane fig 2 a and b shows the number of water molecules permeating through the niat niit membrane during 10 ns simulation at a variety of p1 pressure from 25 to 100 mpa for both niat and niit membranes the number of filtered waters increases proportionally to simulation time at each pressure and moreover the speed of water slope of the curve through the mof membrane increases as the pressure rises obviously water molecules pass through the single layer 1 l membrane slightly faster than the 2 l membrane at the same pressure subsequently the water flux was estimated by calculating the slope of the filtered water number with respect to simulation time as shown in fig 2c and d under the external pressure of 100 mpa the water fluxes of 1 l niat and niit membrane can reach 662 water molecules ns and 538 water molecules ns while those of the 2 l membranes decline slightly 486 water molecules ns for niat and 347 water molecules ns for niit at the same time the 1 l mof membranes exhibit a satisfying salt rejection rate in detail the 1 l niit membrane can prevent 85 nacl even at the high pressure of 100 mpa while for 1 l niat the rejection rate is slightly lower at 80 it should be noted that the addition of a second layer can greatly improve the salt rejection efficiency which can reach 100 for niit and 96 for niat at 100 mpa moreover the linear relationship between the pressure and the water flux indicates a pore flow mechanism of water transport in the niit niat membranes wang et al 2021a this is further confirmed by the water flux results of 3 l to 5 l niit niat membranes under pressure from 25 mpa to 100 mpa shown in fig s2 in the esi to further explore the influence of the number of stacking layers on desalination performance we calculated the water permeability and salt rejection of multilayered 1 5 niit and niat membranes under the external pressure of 50 mpa and the results were summarized in fig 3 for both mofs the 1 l filter exhibits the highest water permeability of 74 l cm2 mpa day for niit and 90 l cm2 mpa day for niat meanwhile the salt rejection ratio reached over 90 the increase of the membrane layers greatly hinders the rapid passage of water molecules for both mof membranes for niit the water permeability gradually decreased with the increase of layers and finally dropped to 25 l cm2 mpa day for the 5 l case for the niat membrane the water permeability is less sensitive to membrane thickness which still maintained a permeability of over 50 l cm2 mpa day for the 5 l membrane which is about twice the value of that of niit meanwhile the increase in membrane thickness enables a remarkable enhancement in ion rejection one can see that niit multilayers 2 l can efficiently block 100 ions while for the niat membranes the salt rejection reaches 99 for 3 l and above it is worth noting that during the preparation of mof membranes microporous defects are inevitably present lu et al 2020 which would largely reduce the salt rejection rate of the membrane therefore multilayer stacked mofs are often utilized in practice to eliminate the effect of defects of the mof membranes furthermore one challenge usually encountered in water filtration based on our simulation model is concentration polarization sablani et al 2001 wang et al 2021a which would impede the high water flux and induce membrane contamination however a cross flow filtration device was often adopted in recent experiments fan et al 2018 liu et al 2019 which significantly reduces the effect of concentration polarization as higher shear force would carry away ions to prevent them from depositing on the membrane surface 3 3 microscopic nature of water density velocity and hydrogen network from the above analyses the niat membrane is less regulated by the membrane thickness albeit with high similarity to the niit structure this might be beneficial for practical applications because the performance of niat membrane will be less affected by the fabrication process to probe the reason for the higher water permeability of niat membrane than niit with similar thickness we further analyzed the density distribution of water oxygen atoms through nanopore of 1 l niit and niat membranes and projected them onto the membrane plane as shown in fig 4 a six intense red regions representing high water probability were detected corresponding to six obvious water channels in the niit nanopores with oxygen atoms pointing to hydrogen atoms at the pore edge in contrast for the niat membrane although six water channels can be identified they are relatively localized in the channel center region which might contribute to the easier passage of water and accordingly the enhanced water flux of niat over niit in the more obvious water channels of the niat membrane a much higher water transport velocity was observed than niit membrane for all types of pore area as summarized in fig 4c more specifically for the niit membrane the water velocity gradually decreases from 5 80 m s to 0 with respect to the distance away from the pore center while for the niat membrane the water velocity decreases from 7 15 m s to 0 it should be noted that the maximum velocity of water reaches as high as 7 15 m s at the pore center of niat membrane which is much larger than previous reports including the ni hab 6 m s porous graphene 4 m s and porous mos2 3 5 m s cao et al 2019 revealing the higher water permeability of the niat membrane in the current study the water transport behavior is highly dependent on the water structure when confined inside the transport channel to characterize the water structure inside the filtration membranes we analyzed the average number of h bonds per water molecule in the pore area in pore and that restricted between two adjacent layers interlayer the results are shown in fig 4d and e as can be seen for both niit and niat most of the water molecules 83 for niit and 77 for niat respectively in the pore area forms 3 or 4 h bonds which is comparable to that of bulk water 3 5 h bonds kumar et al 2007 however for water molecules restricted between two layers only a small ratio of water 33 for niit and 37 for niat forms 3 h bonds and there are about 15 water molecules forming none h bonds with neighboring ones therefore water molecules in the interlayer are more isolated and restricted with a bad structured h bonds network 3 4 water transport resistance analysis to further explore the effect of the stacking patterns of multi layered niit niat membranes on the water permeability we analyzed the transport behavior inside these two multilayered structures computational methods are detailed in esi following previous reports zhang et al 2018b zhou et al 2019 the total transport resistance composed of the interfacial resistance and the interior resistance for both structures are investigated which are illustrated in fig 5 a notable positive correlation is observed between the total transport resistances and the thickness of the multi layered membranes indicating that water molecules pass more slowly through the thicker membranes resulting in the decrease of the water permeability comparing two membranes niat has a smaller transport resistance than niit with the same thickness leading to the higher water permeability of niat this is attributed to the distinct different distribution of the interfacial resistance and the interior resistance of two membranes in detail for the niit membrane the interior resistance raises rapidly with the increase of the layer number and attains to 80 of the total resistance at the 5 l case while for the niat membrane the interior resistance increases much slower with the increase of the layer number and only contributes 53 of the total resistance in the 5 l case these results are in good agreement with the aforementioned water permeability where the performance of niat membrane is less sensitive to the thickness as its interior resistance is less affected by the layer number 3 5 free energy calculations to probe the physical origin of the fast water passage and suppressed ion permeation through the mof membranes the pmf of water na and cl translocating through 1 3 layers of niit niat membranes were explicitly calculated using the umbrella sampling method as can be seen in fig 6 a the free energy barrier of water to pass through the niat membrane is the lowest which is 5 5 kj mol while for ions considerably high energy barriers were detected for na 13 kj mol and cl 18 kj mol we attributed the high barriers to the hard dehydration of salt ions fig s3 in the esi when squeezing through the nanopore for the 2 l mofs membrane as shown in fig 6b the energy barrier for water passing through the niat membranes slightly increased to 6 4 kj mol which is consistent with the lower water permeability for the 2 l niat in the normal simulations moreover a local energy minimum sandwiched by two energy maximums was observed between two layers resulting in a small energy peak of 2 kj mol for water passage for ions the case is similar where the free energy barriers are higher for both na 17 8 kj mol and cl 27 1 kj mol than that in the 1 l case leading to a higher ion rejection rate for the 2 l membrane especially for niat further increasing the layer number to 3 does not affect the energy barriers too much water 6 8 kj mol na 18 kj mol cl 28 1 kj mol as shown in fig 6c however water and ions have to overcome local energy barriers water 2 kj mol na 4 1 kj mol cl 10 kj mol step by step which results in the relatively lower water permeability and higher salt rejection for the multilayered cases as summarized in fig 6d f the water density along the transporting direction is well consistent with the undulation of pmf curves appearing in an obvious negative correlation for the 1 l niat the lowest water density was located in the pore of the membrane corresponding to the energy barrier located at the pore center while two high water density peaks were observed near the membrane consistent with two energy minimums at two sides of the membrane for both the 2 l and 3 l cases a local water density peak can be found between two neighboring layers which is in agreement with the interlayer energy minimum besides pmf profiles for water and ions translocation through niit membranes were summarized in fig s4 in esi where similar trends were observed the niit membrane always imposes stronger regulation on water and ions than niat membrane taking the 3 l niit membrane for example na needs to overcome an additional 2 kj mol to translocate through the nanopore of niit compared to that of niat while for water the situation is the same where the barrier raises to 7 3 kj mol this also supports the higher water flux of niat membrane from the above analyses controlling the thickness of the mof membrane can effectively regulate the energy barriers for water and ion passage increase in membrane thickness makes it more difficult for all molecules to pass through which inevitably slows the water flow meanwhile largely preventing the passage of ions through the mof filters meanwhile the slightly structural distinction between niit and niat would effectively modulate the water permeation and salt rejection of the filter thus in practical applications the performance of the membrane can be well controlled through engineering of the mof structures to reach the balance of considerably high water permeability with a high ion rejection ratio 3 6 comparison between desalination membranes to further demonstrate the high performance of mof membranes we compared the water permeability and ion rejection rate of niit and niat mof membranes with those of previously reported membranes including conventional reverse osmosis membranes e g mfi zeolite and 2d membranes like nanoporous graphene and mos2 cao et al 2019 2020 guillen and hoek 2009 li et al 2004 pendergast and hoek 2011 as shown in fig 7 the 2 l niit mof exhibit excellent salt rejection of 100 and water permeability 45 5 l cm2 mpa day which is about 5 orders of magnitude higher than those of conventional reverse osmosis membranes 5 times higher in magnitude than that of mos2 and graphene but slightly lower than that of 2 l cu hab membrane further thicker niit membranes still exhibited higher performance than most membranes for example a high water permeation of 25 l cm2 mpa day can be obtained for the 5 l niit membrane the water permeability of 2 l niat mof membrane 71 l cm2 mpa day exceeds all the other membranes mentioned above and meanwhile 2 l niat can effectively block 96 nacl for the 5 l niat membrane the water flux can still maintain as high as 50 l cm2 mpa day and the ion rejection increases to 99 therefore niit and niat mofs are two highly competitive candidates for desalination membranes that surely deserve further experimental exploration 4 conclusion to conclude by employing md simulations we theoretically studied the desalination performance of niit and niat mof membranes the water permeability of the 2 l niit mof membrane reaches 45 l cm2 mpa day and complete ion rejection is realized for the 2 l niat mof membrane it has a higher water flux of 71 l cm2 mpa day and prevents 96 nacl passage the in plane water density distribution and transport resistance analyses indicate that the improved water permeation of the niat membrane corresponds to the denser water pack higher water velocity and lower transport resistance through the nanopores of niat furthermore quantitative pmf analysis shows that the free energy barrier of water molecules e g 5 5 kj mol through 1 l niat and 6 4 kj mol through 2 l niat passing through the mof membrane is much lower than that of ion na 13 kj mol and cl 15 8 kj mol through 1 l niat and na 17 8 kj mol and cl 27 kj mol through 2 l niat implying that ions are more difficult to pass through mof membrane than water moreover multilayered membranes slightly suppress the passage of water molecules but are beneficial for the salt blockage this enhanced ion rejection for the multilayered cases is mainly due to the interlayer restriction by neighboring sheets other than the in pore confinement compared to previously reported desalination architectures the mofs membrane demonstrated considerably high performance moreover the water permeability and ion rejection ratio of the mof membrane are adjustable through controlling the mof thickness and fine tuning the structure of the mof membrane offering a possibility for the design of a novel desalination membrane with low energy cost through structural engineering therefore our present study highlights the great potential of niit niat mof membranes as efficient desalination materials which are worth further experimental exploration credit authorship

15181,the synergistic metabolism by anammox cultures and nitrate reducers for anaerobic pah biodegradation is largely unknown including whether anammox culture and which kind of anammox bacterium can perform nitrogen metabolism in the anaerobic pah biodegradation processes the inhibitory effect of pah on anammox activity and nitrite on pah degrading nitrate reducers activity and the synergistic metabolic processes herein an anammox culture that can eliminate nitrite accumulation and decrease inorganic carbon emission during anaerobic phenanthrene a model of pah in this study biodegradation the synergistic mechanism for phenanthrene biodegradation by a nitrate reducer and such anammox culture and the inhibition effect of phenanthrene on such anammox culture and nitrite on a phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer were newly discussed the results showed that nitrite largely accumulated during anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation nitrate accumulation is a common phenomenon for the biodegradation of refractory matter including pahs by nitrate reducers by a nitrate reducer phen2 which mineralizes phenanthrene to inorganic carbon and nitrite was verified as an inhibiting factor for further biodegradation anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation rates and nitrite concentrations 0 7 mm appeared to have a negative linear correlation the anammox culture that mainly contained candidatus kuenenia was newly found to efficiently reduce nitrite accumulation and inorganic carbon emissions and significantly promote biodegradation efficiency by 1 94 fold our results showed that phenanthrene absorbed in and on anammox cells had a more direct relationship with the inhibitory effect on anammox activity than phenanthrene in the environment and 15 2 mg gvss phenanthrene absorbed in and on the cells 4 mm concentration in the culture showed nearly complete inhibition of anammox culture in this study in addition few less than 2 abundance anammox bacteria were found to be enough for the removal of nitrite produced from anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation in an ideal world co pollutants of ammonia nitrate phenanthrene and nitrite could be converted to nitrogen gas and biomass by the synergistic metabolism of anammox cultures and nitrate reducers our study reveals a new synergistic process that may exist in our environments for pah elimination by an anammox culture and a nitrate reducer which provides a new strategy for the bioremediation of pah polluted anoxic zones graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox culture anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation nitrite accumulation inorganic carbon emission inhibitory effect synergistic metabolic mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phenanthrene a member of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contamination is of scientific and social interest because of its toxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity frequently phenanthrene pollutants are found in anaerobic environments which include groundwater aquifer sediments wetlands and deep layers of contaminated soil and are also frequently polluted by ammonia nitrate and nitrite bewley and webb 2001 broholm et al 1998 han et al 2013 han et al 2021 liu et al 2021a lu et al 2022 shi et al 2020 wang et al 2022 xu et al 2014 and the concentrations of phenanthrene ammonia nitrate and nitrate in above polluted environments ranged in scale from nanograms to micrograms per liter of water or per kilogram of soil although phenanthrene pollutants in anaerobic environments can be removed by ex situ bioremediation which is easier to monitor and control than in situ bioremediation through aerobic biodegradation by the application of oxygen ex situ bioremediation is much more costly for aeration pumping or excavation and poses a much greater technological hurdle than in situ bioremediation therefore in situ bioremediation of phenanthrene pollutants in anaerobic zones is an attractive bioremediation technique nitrate could be selected as the electron acceptor for bioremediation of phenanthrene contamination due to low cost high water solubility and redox potential close to oxygen dou et al 2009 kuypers et al 2018 shen et al 2015 xu et al 2015 due to the above advantages the anaerobic biodegradation of phenanthrene with nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor has gradually gained more attention on the other hand nitrite accumulation has been observed frequently in nitrate reducing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah including phenanthrene biodegradation processes dou et al 2009 scott et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 2021c in addition anaerobic pah including phenanthrene biodegradation with nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor was found to frequently quit when considerable amounts of pah remained in the culture and nitrite accumulated to a certain amount scott et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 2021c high concentrations of nitrite could lead to high concentrations of free nitrous acid fna and a high concentration of fna might inhibit further biodegradation of pah by inhibiting the growth and respiration of cells encoding metabolic enzymes and increasing the formation of toxic substances ramos et al 2016 wang et al 2018b for other pollutants the activities of nitrate reducing bacteria could be completely inhibited when the concentration of nitrite in the culture reached a high level zhou et al 2011 nevertheless the inhibitory effect of accumulated nitrite on the further biodegradation of pah under nitrate reducing conditions has still not been studied meanwhile nitrite which is a frequently detected pollutant in groundwater drinking water wastewater and soil is highly toxic to life and a serious carcinogen to humans cheng et al 2020 golaki et al 2022 mastrocicco et al 2019 ruiz et al 2003 wang et al 2018a under nitrate reducing conditions previous studies showed that the enriched cultures that mainly contained dechloromonas shinella and pseudomonas stutzeri could be involved in nitrate reducing phenanthrene biodegradation interestingly anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria were found in all of the above enriched cultures and different pah polluted environments ben salem et al 2019 han et al 2021 jiang et al 2016 jin et al 2020 liu et al 2021b zhang et al 2022 2020 however the role of anammox bacteria in the above enriched cultures and environments has not been discussed anammox bacteria of which six known candidatus genera were found by previous studies can utilize ammonia and nitrite to produce nitrogen gas and a certain proportion of nitrate and inorganic carbon including carbon dioxide bicarbonate and carbonate can be utilized by anammox bacteria for amplification fu et al 2021 hu et al 2022 ma et al 2017 zhang and okabe 2020 the anammox bacteria present in the above nitrate reducing phenanthrene degrading enriched cultures may be involved in the removal of nitrite produced by nitrate reducers for anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation which needs to be verified although some studies have shown that some anammox cultures can be applied to remove nitrogen in the presence of different organic carbons including sodium acetate butyric acid and even some single ring aromatic hydrocarbons ali et al 2020 kartal et al 2010 li et al 2011 ni et al 2012 ramos et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a anammox bacteria are also frequently reported to be inhibited by toxic organic matter including alcohol aldehydes phenols antibiotics p nitrophenol o cresol o chlorophenol quinoline and ethane etc due to cell lysis and decreased enzyme activity jin et al 2012 ramos et al 2015 talan et al 2021 tan et al 2022 weralupitiya et al 2021 although some studies found that anammox culture could survive in the enrichment cultures responsible for nitrate reducing anaerobic pah biodegradation zhang et al 2020 whether pah affects anammox is an open question and whether and which kind of anammox culture can perform its activity in the anaerobic pah one kind of toxic organic matter biodegradation processes and the synergistic mechanism between pah degrading nitrate reducers and anammox cultures have not been illustrated in the present study we isolated an anaerobic phenanthrene biodegrading nitrate reducer and enriched an anammox culture from a phenanthrene degrading and nitrate reducing bacterial consortium that contains phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducers and a certain amount of anammox bacteria zhang et al 2020 to explore whether the anammox culture can perform carbon and nitrogen metabolism in anaerobic phenanthrene a model of pah in this study biodegradation with nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor and the synergistic mechanism between phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer and anammox culture in addition the inhibitory effect of nitrite on a phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer and phenanthrene on an anammox culture will be newly discussed the results of this study provide and verify a novel synergistic process for phenanthrene biodegradation that is completed by an anammox culture and a phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer and a new anammox culture that can participate in anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation coupled with nitrate reduction and the results can provide some guidance for the treatment of groundwater wastewater wetlands aquifer sediments and deep layers of contaminated soil that are simultaneously polluted by pah ammonia nitrite or not and nitrate and nitrate assisted pah bioremediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 isolation of phenanthrene degrading and nitrate reducers and enrichment of anammox culture we selected an enrichment culture showing anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation activity of 4 7 μm d in our laboratory to isolate a phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer and enrich an anammox culture zhang et al 2020 one isolate designated phen2 was found to have phenanthrene degrading and nitrate reducing capabilities the methods for the isolation and identification processes of phen2 the measurement of phenanthrene degradation nitrate reduction and nitrite production by phen2 and the detection of metabolic products and genes responsible for nitrate reducing phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 are stated in supplementary materials text s1 s3 the anammox culture was enriched by using 50 ml of anoxic mineral medium suitable for anammox bacterial growth kang et al 2019 after the concentration of ammonia or nitrite decreased to near zero the centrifuged culture from 10 ml of the medium was transferred to a fresh mineral medium that contained approximately 10 mm ammonia and 13 2 mm nitrite an enriched culture containing relatively highly abundant anammox bacteria and exhibiting high anammox activity was obtained after 40 cycles of transfer the community compositions of the enriched anammox culture were measured by sinobiocore biotechnology co ltd beijing china through high throughput sequencing regarding the activity test for the enriched anammox culture 800 μl of sample was collected and filtered by a 0 22 μm membrane every 2 h a total of 12 h and ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations during the culture period were measured using a spectrophotometer uv 1800 japan and the methods set by the american public health association apha 2017 and triplicate measurements were performed for each sample meanwhile the phenanthrene biodegradation ability of the enriched anammox culture was determined as described above all reagents in the current study were purchased from sigma aldrich usa at the highest purity unless otherwise stated 2 2 test of the inhibitory effect of phenanthrene on anammox culture activity to gain further insight into the acute effects of phenanthrene on the activity of anammox culture enriched in this study five concentration gradients 0 1 2 3 4 mm of phenanthrene absorbed on the amberlite xad 7 were added in different anammox cultures that contained 0 2 gvss l biomass 10 mm ammonia and 13 2 mm nitrite then all the anammox cultures were incubated at 30 c and 150 rpm and the liquids were sampled every 8 h a total of 64 h for measurement of ammonia and nitrite concentrations the phenanthrene absorbed on and into the anammox cells was also measured to determine its inhibitory effect on the activity of anammox culture enriched in this study after amberlite xad 7 settled several seconds to settle 10 ml of culture was harvested and the culture was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min then the supernatant was removed the phenanthrene of the settled anammox biomass was extracted by using 10 ml of dichloromethane and ultrasounding at 1 kw for 30 min and measured as described above the inhibitory effect on anammox activity the biomass amount for each culture was the same was calculated by the following equations 1 sa c 0 c t 2 inhibition 1 sa s a 0 100 where c0 and c are the ammonia or nitrite concentrations at time 0 and t and sa and sa0 are anammox activities with different phenanthrene concentrations and without phenanthrene respectively to test the recovery of phenanthrene inhibition on anammox culture the almost completely inhibited cultures were inoculated into new medium and cultivated for another eight days the liquids were sampled every 2 days a total of eight days for measurement of ammonia and nitrite concentrations all of the above test groups were conducted in triplicate 2 3 construction of joint systems by mixing the nitrate reducing phen2 culture and anammox culture our joint systems were constructed by mixing phen2 culture and anammox culture with volatile suspended solid vss ratios g g of 100 1 50 1 25 1 10 1 5 1 and 1 1 a total of 0 2 gvss l for each joint system the culture medium for the joint system was the same as the phenanthrene degrading culture phen2 which contained mineral medium and 1 4 mm phenanthrene and the culture time for each joint system was 16 days the phenanthrene and nitrite concentrations were measured as described above and quadruplicate measurements for phenanthrene and triplicate measurements for nitrite were performed for each sample the ph of each culture was measured by a ph meter thermofisher usa meanwhile the total inorganic carbon including carbon dioxide bicarbonate and carbonate contents of the phen2 culture and the joint system of phen2 culture and anammox culture with a vss ratio g g of 50 1 after acidification were measured every two days and calculated by henry s law as described previously zhang et al 2021b 2 4 determination of anammox bacteria percentage by fish analysis the percentage of anammox bacteria at the 0 and 16th days of each joint system culture period was determined by using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis the methods for fixation of bacterial cells hybridization of total microbes and anammox bacteria and calculation of anammox bacteria percentage were the same as previously described gao et al 2012 2 5 test of the nitrite inhibitory effect on phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 to test the inhibitory effect 0 12 mm nitrite was added initially into each phen2 culture that contained approximately 1 4 mm phenanthrene and 20 mm nitrate subsequently one day of culture short culture time was applied to avoid dramatic changes in nitrite concentrations was performed to calculate the phenanthrene biodegradation rate with different initial concentrations of nitrite with the culture conditions being an initial ph of 7 2 and 32 c in the dark the phenanthrene and nitrite concentrations were measured every two days as described above triplicate measurements were performed for each sample 2 6 further test of the influence of anammox culture on anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by nitrate reducer another 12 days of culture a total of 28 days was performed to test the complete phenanthrene and nitrite accumulation removal ability of the phen2 culture and joint system with different phen2 cultures and anammox bacteria vss ratios samples were taken every 4 days for measurement of phenanthrene and nitrite concentrations triplicate measurements were performed for each sample 2 7 statistical analyses the data obtained from triplicate measurements were used to perform a two sample t test to determine whether their means differed significantly by employing minitab 17 software state college pa usa the conditions of the t test were a confidence level of 95 hypothesized difference of zero and the difference not being equal to the hypothesized difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification and metabolic characteristics of phen2 metabolic processes for phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 and microbial community structure of enriched anammox culture and its activity although anammox bacteria approximately 1 to 7 of abundance were frequently found to exist in the nitrate reducing pah degrading enriched cultures the role of anammox bacteria in these enrichments is still largely unknown han et al 2021 jin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 here we explore the synergistic processes for phenanthrene a model pah in this study biodegradation by a nitrate reducer and an anammox culture by isolating them from a previously enriched culture zhang et al 2020 one colony which was yellow round smooth and opaque was picked and found to have phenanthrene biodegradation and nitrate reduction abilities in this study we named the isolate phen2 and the strain phen2 revealed the highest level of 16s rrna similarity more than 99 over 1408 nucleotides with pseudomonas stutzeri fig 1 a pseudomonas stutzeri has been reported to participate in the anaerobic biodegradation of naphthalene and is probably involved in anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation with nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor rockne et al 2000 zhang et al 2020 our results indicated that phen2 could truly anaerobic biodegradation of phenanthrene the 16s rrna gene sequence of phen2 was submitted to genbank under accession number mz068035 to test the metabolic characteristics of phen2 phenanthrene nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured during a culture period lasting 13 d as fig 1b shows 43 9 48 6 average 46 1 removal rate was observed when phenanthrene was initially added at 1 376 mm with the abiotic losses and nitrate dependent losses being relatively insignificant with averages of 1 1 and 2 respectively fig s1 furthermore phen2 could biodegrade 45 8 of phenanthrene within 7 d but a biodegradation efficiency of 46 1 was achieved only on day 13 the average anaerobic phenanthrene degradation rate of strain phen2 was 46 5 51 μm d which is much higher than that of other reported pure cultures or highly enriched cultures which was 0 07 14 5 μm d liang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 2021c the description of metabolic processes for anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 detected by metabolites genome and reverse transcription quantitative polymeric chain reaction rt qpcr is listed in supplementary materials text s4 after 13 d of anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation 14 81 17 31 mm nitrate consumption was observed in the phen2 culture coupled with anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation and no nitrate losses were found in the abiotic controls data not shown furthermore 9 9 10 6 mm nitrite was produced coupled with nitrate reduction by phen2 fig 1b strain phen2 consumed 24 5 25 9 mm of nitrate per mm of phenanthrene biodegradation indicating that a part of nitrate was not converted completely to nitrogen gas as the consumption amount of nitrate should be 13 2 mm when it is converted completely to nitrogen gas the production of a certain amount of nitrite also indicated that nitrate was not completely reduced during anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 the result of the nitrate conversion processes of phen2 was the same as a previously described highly enriched culture but differed from a previously described pure culture zhang et al 2020 2021c but the accumulation of nitrite was a common phenomenon during anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by the above cultures genome analyses for nitrate reduction showed that phen2 has a complete suite of genes responsible for nitrate transport and the conversion of nitrate to nitrogen table s2 but the accumulation of nitrite may be due to the low bioavailability of phenanthrene jiang et al 2020 lin et al 2019 smreczak et al 2008 the dominant bacterium in the enriched anammox culture belonged to candidatus kuenenia 47 93 relative abundance which belongs to a genus of anammox cultures and has been reported to be involved in the reduction of nitrite produced by anaerobic biodegradation of benzene or other organic matter han et al 2020 li et al 2018 the main reason could be that candidatus kuenenia had a high matrix tolerance of phenanthrene except for the dominant bacterium other bacteria with relatively high abundance in the enriched anammox culture included fusibacter 17 1 relative abundance geosporobacter 4 38 relative abundance tissierella 3 08 relative abundance parvibaculum 2 12 relative abundance oceanibaculum 2 08 relative abundance ignavibacterium 1 88 relative abundance pseudomonas 1 88 relative abundance and gp3 1 77 relative abundance which established a symbiotic system with candidatus kuenenia in addition the sum of other bacteria in the enriched anammox bacteria with abundances below 1 accounted for 17 1 of the microbial community fig 1c to test the activity of the enriched anammox culture the ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured every 2 h during the 12 h of culture the culture could decrease ammonia from a concentration of 9 9 mm to zero coupled with decreasing nitrite from a concentration of 13 1 mm to zero producing a 2 53 mm concentration of nitrate within 12 h fig 1d the activity of the anammox culture in this study falls between the reported activities of common anammox culture and high efficiency anammox culture kang et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 3 2 change in anammox culture activity upon phenanthrene inhibition and recovery whether phenanthrene a model of pah in this study affects anammox is still an open question including whether phenanthrene can inhibit the activity of anammox culture and the inhibitory effect of phenanthrene on the activity of anammox culture as shown in fig 2 a and b the ammonia and nitrite removal rates decreased when the anammox culture was inoculated with 1 4 mm phenanthrene with phenanthrene concentrations of 1 2 3 and 4 mm the anammox culture activity was inhibited by 5 1 12 1 14 1 24 2 71 6 89 9 and 91 8 97 5 compared with the control group without phenanthrene respectively which indicated that phenanthrene could truly affect the anammox culture activity and that the inhibitory effect was concentration dependent the relationship between the inhibition percentages of anammox culture activity and phenanthrene concentrations in the culture is shown in fig 2c which showed a weak linear correlation r2 0 77 0 81 as shown in fig 2d the phenanthrene absorbed on and into the anammox cells increased with increasing added concentration in the culture and the phenanthrene absorbed on and into the anammox cells showed a stronger linear correlation r2 0 99 with the inhibition percentage of anammox culture activity fig 2e which indicated that phenanthrene absorbed on and into the cells affected the anammox activity more directly than phenanthrene in the environment the activity of anammox culture was severely inhibited by an average of 15 2 mg gvss phenanthrene exposure and no recovery of anammox activity was observed after the inhibited anammox was inoculated in fresh medium for eight days fig 2f suggesting that the inhibition of anammox activity by phenanthrene was irreversible this was the same as the irreversible methanol inhibition that damaged the anammox bacteria from microbial poisoning or enzyme inactivation and was different from the reversible ethane inhibition isaka et al 2008 tan et al 2022 the reasons for the inhibition of anammox culture activity by phenanthrene may be cell lysis enzyme activity decreasing and blocking the transmission of ammonia and nitrite 3 3 influence of enriched anammox culture on anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation efficiency anammox bacteria percentage changes and inorganic carbon production the above enriched anammox culture was applied to construct the joint system with the isolated phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer phen2 after 16 days of cultivation the joint system that initially contained phen2 and enriched anammox culture with a vss ratio g g of 50 1 showed the highest phenanthrene degradation efficiency which was 1 94 fold higher than that of the phen2 culture alone meanwhile the phenanthrene degradation efficiencies of joint systems containing phen2 and enriched anammox cultures with initial vss ratios g g of 100 1 25 1 10 1 5 1 and 1 1 were 1 37 1 68 1 47 1 11 and 1 06 fold higher respectively than that of the phen2 culture alone fig 3 a this result suggests that 1 the anammox culture applied in this study could assist in anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by nitrate reducers which was newly reported and 2 few anammox bacteria are enough to construct an excellent performance of joint systems with nitrate reducers for anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation as shown in fig 3b the anammox bacteria percentage of the joint systems changed during the culture period in which the percentages of anammox bacteria of the joint systems with phen2 and enriched anammox culture with vss ratios g g of 100 1 initial 0 48 of anammox bacteria and 50 1 initial 0 94 of anammox bacteria increased whereas the others initial 1 88 4 22 7 86 and 22 87 of anammox bacteria declined the results further indicated that small amounts of anammox culture between 1 and 2 abundance were appropriate for the joint system to anaerobic biodegradation of phenanthrene as shown in fig 3c and d although the joint system of phen2 and anammox culture produced a few more amounts of inorganic carbon than phen2 alone the ratio of produced inorganic carbon and consumed phenanthrene was much lower in the joint system which indicated that the joint system produced much less inorganic carbon with the same phenanthrene consumption than phen2 alone in theory only biomass and nitrogen gas were produced when the phenanthrene ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the environment were in a ratio of 1 y z 1 32z 1 2k x x 0 26z and 5y 0 066z 14 as shown in eqs 1 3 among which c5h7o2n refers to the phen2 cell formulation and ch2o0 5n0 15

mm accumulated in the phen2 culture and less nitrite accumulation was found in the joint systems with anammox bacteria added which indicated that the anammox culture applied in this study could perform nitrite reduction activity in the presence of phenanthrene nitrite accumulation and incomplete biodegradation were observed during phen2 growth on phenanthrene which are phenomena frequently encountered in the biodegradation of refractory organic matter under nitrate reducing conditions burland and edwards 1999 dou et al 2009 keller et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 2021c nitrite accumulation could probably be ascribed to the low carbon bioavailability of refractory organic matter and incomplete biodegradation could be ascribed to the biotoxicity of accumulated nitrite to produce fna boiocchi et al 2017 hartop et al 2017 wang et al 2018b yu et al 2020 the free nitrous acid fna concentration of each culture was calculated according to the equation fna no 2 n exp 2300 273 t 1 0 ph kakar et al 2021 as many as 0 021 mg l fna existed in the phen2 culture on the 16th day which was much more than that in the joint systems 0 000042 0 0041 mg l table 1 3 4 inhibitory effect of nitrite on anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 as shown in fig 4 a phen2 could biodegrade an average of only 44 6 phenanthrene with an initial concentration of 1 39 mm whereas the joint system 1 50 mixture of enriched anammox culture and phen2 could biodegrade an average of 86 7 phenanthrene with an initial concentration of 1 43 mm within 16 days the joint system facilitated approximately 94 4 phenanthrene degradation efficiency additionally the biodegradation of phenanthrene by phen2 almost stopped at day 8 for an unknown reason whereas phenanthrene biodegradation by the joint system could continue as shown in fig 4b the enriched anammox culture had no ability to biodegrade phenanthrene therefore the promoted biodegradation efficiency was not induced by the biodegradation of phenanthrene by the added enriched anammox culture remarkably the joint system not only effectively facilitated the biodegradation efficiency of phenanthrene but also reduced nitrite accumulation by 85 3 fig 4c our results also showed that anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation was affected by nitrite concentrations as shown in fig 4d the anaerobic biodegradation rate of phenanthrene was 92 5 μm d when the concentration of nitrite was zero and the biodegradation rate was almost zero when the nitrite concentration reached 12 mm furthermore the anaerobic biodegradation rate of phenanthrene showed a negative linear relationship with the nitrite concentrations when the concentrations of nitrite ranged from 0 to 7 mm the results suggested that the presence of nitrite could inhibit further biodegradation or the biodegradation rate of phenanthrene by a nitrate reducer anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 was completely inhibited when the nitrite concentration reached 11 6 12 mm at ph 7 2 and 32 c and the calculated fna concentration was 0 021 mgn l which is similar to the concentration when the activity of some denitrifying bacteria was completely restrained wang et al 2018b zhou et al 2011 3 5 synergistic mechanism of phen2 and anammox culture as shown in fig 5 phen2 could utilize phenanthrene as the carbon source with the reduction of nitrate to produce inorganic carbon nitrite and nitrogen inorganic carbon could be utilized for the cell growth of anammox culture and nitrite could be used to produce nitrogen and nitrate coupled with ammonia oxidation by anammox bacteria among which nitrate could return to phen2 culture in summary phenanthrene nitrate ammonia and nitrite could be utilized by the joint system anammox bacteria and phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer phen2 to only produce nitrogen gas and biomass the inorganic carbon was partly removed in this study fig 3c because the nitrite produced by phen2 during anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation was not enough for inorganic carbon utilization by anammox bacteria complete inorganic carbon fixation to form biomass may occur when a certain amount of nitrite is also present in the environment in other words the joint system can simultaneously remove nitrite from the environment in summary a c and n cycle can be formed by the joint system which cannot only bioremediate pah ammonia nitrate and nitrite pollutants but also decrease nitrite and inorganic carbon emissions the synergistic metabolic processes could exist in the real environments as a part of the recirculation of substances the limiting conditions for the cycle included 1 pah ammonia nitrite or not and nitrate simultaneously exist in the environment 2 less than 12 mm nitrite exists in the environment and 3 less than 15 2 mg gvss phenanthrene is absorbed on and into the cells of the environment as shown in table 2 complete removal of phenanthrene and nitrite was observed within 24 days when the initial phen2 culture and enriched anammox culture vss ratio g g was 50 1 and complete or nearly complete removal of phenanthrene and nitrite was observed within 28 days when the initial phen2 culture and enriched anammox culture vss ratios g g were 100 1 25 1 10 1 5 1 and 1 1 in the phen2 culture alone in contrast only 44 4 44 8 of phenanthrene was removed and 11 5 11 6 mm nitrite accumulated in the supernatant the results indicate that other initial vss ratios except 50 1 of phen2 culture and enriched anammox culture can also achieve the complete removal of phenanthrene for a longer time which may be caused by the growth of phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer and community succession of other initial vss ratios of cultures anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia in this study cannot only assist the biodegradation of phenanthrene by nitrate reducers but also reduce the accumulation of nitrite and the production of inorganic carbon meanwhile the anammox culture used in this study does not have the ability to degrade phenanthrene which indicates that the anammox culture assists phenanthrene biodegradation by reducing nitrite in the culture for the total metabolic processes anammox culture can utilize the inorganic carbon and nitrite gao et al 2012 kuenen 2008 produced by phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducers and produce some nitrate to return to phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducers as the terminal electron acceptor to degrade phenanthrene although the activity of most anammox bacteria tends to be inhibited by organic matter especially toxic organic matter cho et al 2019 jin et al 2012 nguyen and tran 2021 an anammox culture in the current study mainly comprising candidatus kuenenia that was enriched from a phenanthrene degrading and nitrate reducing consortia was newly verified to maintain activity in the presence of phenanthrene and metabolites of anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 4 conclusions collectively our results newly indicated that one anammox culture that mainly contained candidatus kuenenia could co operate with a nitrate reducer for anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation meanwhile the inhibitory effects of phenanthrene a model of pah in this study on an anammox culture and nitrite on a phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer were newly discussed in addition our findings provided a new strategy by the cooperation of anammox culture and nitrate reducer for the bioremediation of pah pollution in anaerobic environments to solve the problem of nitrite accumulation incomplete biodegradation of pah and production of inorganic carbon which is extremely beneficial to our environment meanwhile our findings can also provide some guidance for the bioremediation of anaerobic environments simultaneously polluted by pah ammonia nitrate and nitrite although important discoveries were revealed by this study there are also limitations first whether other kinds of anammox bacteria can cooperate with nitrate reducers for anaerobic pah biodegradation needs to be further studied second other kinds of pahs especially high molecular weight pahs which are of great concern to researchers need to be further studied including nitrate reducing degraders and anammox bacteria that can keep activity and contribute to the biodegradation third whether the joint systems can be applied in the real world need to be studied in the future

15181,the synergistic metabolism by anammox cultures and nitrate reducers for anaerobic pah biodegradation is largely unknown including whether anammox culture and which kind of anammox bacterium can perform nitrogen metabolism in the anaerobic pah biodegradation processes the inhibitory effect of pah on anammox activity and nitrite on pah degrading nitrate reducers activity and the synergistic metabolic processes herein an anammox culture that can eliminate nitrite accumulation and decrease inorganic carbon emission during anaerobic phenanthrene a model of pah in this study biodegradation the synergistic mechanism for phenanthrene biodegradation by a nitrate reducer and such anammox culture and the inhibition effect of phenanthrene on such anammox culture and nitrite on a phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer were newly discussed the results showed that nitrite largely accumulated during anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation nitrate accumulation is a common phenomenon for the biodegradation of refractory matter including pahs by nitrate reducers by a nitrate reducer phen2 which mineralizes phenanthrene to inorganic carbon and nitrite was verified as an inhibiting factor for further biodegradation anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation rates and nitrite concentrations 0 7 mm appeared to have a negative linear correlation the anammox culture that mainly contained candidatus kuenenia was newly found to efficiently reduce nitrite accumulation and inorganic carbon emissions and significantly promote biodegradation efficiency by 1 94 fold our results showed that phenanthrene absorbed in and on anammox cells had a more direct relationship with the inhibitory effect on anammox activity than phenanthrene in the environment and 15 2 mg gvss phenanthrene absorbed in and on the cells 4 mm concentration in the culture showed nearly complete inhibition of anammox culture in this study in addition few less than 2 abundance anammox bacteria were found to be enough for the removal of nitrite produced from anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation in an ideal world co pollutants of ammonia nitrate phenanthrene and nitrite could be converted to nitrogen gas and biomass by the synergistic metabolism of anammox cultures and nitrate reducers our study reveals a new synergistic process that may exist in our environments for pah elimination by an anammox culture and a nitrate reducer which provides a new strategy for the bioremediation of pah polluted anoxic zones graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox culture anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation nitrite accumulation inorganic carbon emission inhibitory effect synergistic metabolic mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phenanthrene a member of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contamination is of scientific and social interest because of its toxicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity frequently phenanthrene pollutants are found in anaerobic environments which include groundwater aquifer sediments wetlands and deep layers of contaminated soil and are also frequently polluted by ammonia nitrate and nitrite bewley and webb 2001 broholm et al 1998 han et al 2013 han et al 2021 liu et al 2021a lu et al 2022 shi et al 2020 wang et al 2022 xu et al 2014 and the concentrations of phenanthrene ammonia nitrate and nitrate in above polluted environments ranged in scale from nanograms to micrograms per liter of water or per kilogram of soil although phenanthrene pollutants in anaerobic environments can be removed by ex situ bioremediation which is easier to monitor and control than in situ bioremediation through aerobic biodegradation by the application of oxygen ex situ bioremediation is much more costly for aeration pumping or excavation and poses a much greater technological hurdle than in situ bioremediation therefore in situ bioremediation of phenanthrene pollutants in anaerobic zones is an attractive bioremediation technique nitrate could be selected as the electron acceptor for bioremediation of phenanthrene contamination due to low cost high water solubility and redox potential close to oxygen dou et al 2009 kuypers et al 2018 shen et al 2015 xu et al 2015 due to the above advantages the anaerobic biodegradation of phenanthrene with nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor has gradually gained more attention on the other hand nitrite accumulation has been observed frequently in nitrate reducing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah including phenanthrene biodegradation processes dou et al 2009 scott et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 2021c in addition anaerobic pah including phenanthrene biodegradation with nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor was found to frequently quit when considerable amounts of pah remained in the culture and nitrite accumulated to a certain amount scott et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 2021c high concentrations of nitrite could lead to high concentrations of free nitrous acid fna and a high concentration of fna might inhibit further biodegradation of pah by inhibiting the growth and respiration of cells encoding metabolic enzymes and increasing the formation of toxic substances ramos et al 2016 wang et al 2018b for other pollutants the activities of nitrate reducing bacteria could be completely inhibited when the concentration of nitrite in the culture reached a high level zhou et al 2011 nevertheless the inhibitory effect of accumulated nitrite on the further biodegradation of pah under nitrate reducing conditions has still not been studied meanwhile nitrite which is a frequently detected pollutant in groundwater drinking water wastewater and soil is highly toxic to life and a serious carcinogen to humans cheng et al 2020 golaki et al 2022 mastrocicco et al 2019 ruiz et al 2003 wang et al 2018a under nitrate reducing conditions previous studies showed that the enriched cultures that mainly contained dechloromonas shinella and pseudomonas stutzeri could be involved in nitrate reducing phenanthrene biodegradation interestingly anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria were found in all of the above enriched cultures and different pah polluted environments ben salem et al 2019 han et al 2021 jiang et al 2016 jin et al 2020 liu et al 2021b zhang et al 2022 2020 however the role of anammox bacteria in the above enriched cultures and environments has not been discussed anammox bacteria of which six known candidatus genera were found by previous studies can utilize ammonia and nitrite to produce nitrogen gas and a certain proportion of nitrate and inorganic carbon including carbon dioxide bicarbonate and carbonate can be utilized by anammox bacteria for amplification fu et al 2021 hu et al 2022 ma et al 2017 zhang and okabe 2020 the anammox bacteria present in the above nitrate reducing phenanthrene degrading enriched cultures may be involved in the removal of nitrite produced by nitrate reducers for anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation which needs to be verified although some studies have shown that some anammox cultures can be applied to remove nitrogen in the presence of different organic carbons including sodium acetate butyric acid and even some single ring aromatic hydrocarbons ali et al 2020 kartal et al 2010 li et al 2011 ni et al 2012 ramos et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a anammox bacteria are also frequently reported to be inhibited by toxic organic matter including alcohol aldehydes phenols antibiotics p nitrophenol o cresol o chlorophenol quinoline and ethane etc due to cell lysis and decreased enzyme activity jin et al 2012 ramos et al 2015 talan et al 2021 tan et al 2022 weralupitiya et al 2021 although some studies found that anammox culture could survive in the enrichment cultures responsible for nitrate reducing anaerobic pah biodegradation zhang et al 2020 whether pah affects anammox is an open question and whether and which kind of anammox culture can perform its activity in the anaerobic pah one kind of toxic organic matter biodegradation processes and the synergistic mechanism between pah degrading nitrate reducers and anammox cultures have not been illustrated in the present study we isolated an anaerobic phenanthrene biodegrading nitrate reducer and enriched an anammox culture from a phenanthrene degrading and nitrate reducing bacterial consortium that contains phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducers and a certain amount of anammox bacteria zhang et al 2020 to explore whether the anammox culture can perform carbon and nitrogen metabolism in anaerobic phenanthrene a model of pah in this study biodegradation with nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor and the synergistic mechanism between phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer and anammox culture in addition the inhibitory effect of nitrite on a phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer and phenanthrene on an anammox culture will be newly discussed the results of this study provide and verify a novel synergistic process for phenanthrene biodegradation that is completed by an anammox culture and a phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer and a new anammox culture that can participate in anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation coupled with nitrate reduction and the results can provide some guidance for the treatment of groundwater wastewater wetlands aquifer sediments and deep layers of contaminated soil that are simultaneously polluted by pah ammonia nitrite or not and nitrate and nitrate assisted pah bioremediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 isolation of phenanthrene degrading and nitrate reducers and enrichment of anammox culture we selected an enrichment culture showing anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation activity of 4 7 μm d in our laboratory to isolate a phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer and enrich an anammox culture zhang et al 2020 one isolate designated phen2 was found to have phenanthrene degrading and nitrate reducing capabilities the methods for the isolation and identification processes of phen2 the measurement of phenanthrene degradation nitrate reduction and nitrite production by phen2 and the detection of metabolic products and genes responsible for nitrate reducing phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 are stated in supplementary materials text s1 s3 the anammox culture was enriched by using 50 ml of anoxic mineral medium suitable for anammox bacterial growth kang et al 2019 after the concentration of ammonia or nitrite decreased to near zero the centrifuged culture from 10 ml of the medium was transferred to a fresh mineral medium that contained approximately 10 mm ammonia and 13 2 mm nitrite an enriched culture containing relatively highly abundant anammox bacteria and exhibiting high anammox activity was obtained after 40 cycles of transfer the community compositions of the enriched anammox culture were measured by sinobiocore biotechnology co ltd beijing china through high throughput sequencing regarding the activity test for the enriched anammox culture 800 μl of sample was collected and filtered by a 0 22 μm membrane every 2 h a total of 12 h and ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations during the culture period were measured using a spectrophotometer uv 1800 japan and the methods set by the american public health association apha 2017 and triplicate measurements were performed for each sample meanwhile the phenanthrene biodegradation ability of the enriched anammox culture was determined as described above all reagents in the current study were purchased from sigma aldrich usa at the highest purity unless otherwise stated 2 2 test of the inhibitory effect of phenanthrene on anammox culture activity to gain further insight into the acute effects of phenanthrene on the activity of anammox culture enriched in this study five concentration gradients 0 1 2 3 4 mm of phenanthrene absorbed on the amberlite xad 7 were added in different anammox cultures that contained 0 2 gvss l biomass 10 mm ammonia and 13 2 mm nitrite then all the anammox cultures were incubated at 30 c and 150 rpm and the liquids were sampled every 8 h a total of 64 h for measurement of ammonia and nitrite concentrations the phenanthrene absorbed on and into the anammox cells was also measured to determine its inhibitory effect on the activity of anammox culture enriched in this study after amberlite xad 7 settled several seconds to settle 10 ml of culture was harvested and the culture was centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min then the supernatant was removed the phenanthrene of the settled anammox biomass was extracted by using 10 ml of dichloromethane and ultrasounding at 1 kw for 30 min and measured as described above the inhibitory effect on anammox activity the biomass amount for each culture was the same was calculated by the following equations 1 sa c 0 c t 2 inhibition 1 sa s a 0 100 where c0 and c are the ammonia or nitrite concentrations at time 0 and t and sa and sa0 are anammox activities with different phenanthrene concentrations and without phenanthrene respectively to test the recovery of phenanthrene inhibition on anammox culture the almost completely inhibited cultures were inoculated into new medium and cultivated for another eight days the liquids were sampled every 2 days a total of eight days for measurement of ammonia and nitrite concentrations all of the above test groups were conducted in triplicate 2 3 construction of joint systems by mixing the nitrate reducing phen2 culture and anammox culture our joint systems were constructed by mixing phen2 culture and anammox culture with volatile suspended solid vss ratios g g of 100 1 50 1 25 1 10 1 5 1 and 1 1 a total of 0 2 gvss l for each joint system the culture medium for the joint system was the same as the phenanthrene degrading culture phen2 which contained mineral medium and 1 4 mm phenanthrene and the culture time for each joint system was 16 days the phenanthrene and nitrite concentrations were measured as described above and quadruplicate measurements for phenanthrene and triplicate measurements for nitrite were performed for each sample the ph of each culture was measured by a ph meter thermofisher usa meanwhile the total inorganic carbon including carbon dioxide bicarbonate and carbonate contents of the phen2 culture and the joint system of phen2 culture and anammox culture with a vss ratio g g of 50 1 after acidification were measured every two days and calculated by henry s law as described previously zhang et al 2021b 2 4 determination of anammox bacteria percentage by fish analysis the percentage of anammox bacteria at the 0 and 16th days of each joint system culture period was determined by using fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis the methods for fixation of bacterial cells hybridization of total microbes and anammox bacteria and calculation of anammox bacteria percentage were the same as previously described gao et al 2012 2 5 test of the nitrite inhibitory effect on phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 to test the inhibitory effect 0 12 mm nitrite was added initially into each phen2 culture that contained approximately 1 4 mm phenanthrene and 20 mm nitrate subsequently one day of culture short culture time was applied to avoid dramatic changes in nitrite concentrations was performed to calculate the phenanthrene biodegradation rate with different initial concentrations of nitrite with the culture conditions being an initial ph of 7 2 and 32 c in the dark the phenanthrene and nitrite concentrations were measured every two days as described above triplicate measurements were performed for each sample 2 6 further test of the influence of anammox culture on anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by nitrate reducer another 12 days of culture a total of 28 days was performed to test the complete phenanthrene and nitrite accumulation removal ability of the phen2 culture and joint system with different phen2 cultures and anammox bacteria vss ratios samples were taken every 4 days for measurement of phenanthrene and nitrite concentrations triplicate measurements were performed for each sample 2 7 statistical analyses the data obtained from triplicate measurements were used to perform a two sample t test to determine whether their means differed significantly by employing minitab 17 software state college pa usa the conditions of the t test were a confidence level of 95 hypothesized difference of zero and the difference not being equal to the hypothesized difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification and metabolic characteristics of phen2 metabolic processes for phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 and microbial community structure of enriched anammox culture and its activity although anammox bacteria approximately 1 to 7 of abundance were frequently found to exist in the nitrate reducing pah degrading enriched cultures the role of anammox bacteria in these enrichments is still largely unknown han et al 2021 jin et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 here we explore the synergistic processes for phenanthrene a model pah in this study biodegradation by a nitrate reducer and an anammox culture by isolating them from a previously enriched culture zhang et al 2020 one colony which was yellow round smooth and opaque was picked and found to have phenanthrene biodegradation and nitrate reduction abilities in this study we named the isolate phen2 and the strain phen2 revealed the highest level of 16s rrna similarity more than 99 over 1408 nucleotides with pseudomonas stutzeri fig 1 a pseudomonas stutzeri has been reported to participate in the anaerobic biodegradation of naphthalene and is probably involved in anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation with nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor rockne et al 2000 zhang et al 2020 our results indicated that phen2 could truly anaerobic biodegradation of phenanthrene the 16s rrna gene sequence of phen2 was submitted to genbank under accession number mz068035 to test the metabolic characteristics of phen2 phenanthrene nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured during a culture period lasting 13 d as fig 1b shows 43 9 48 6 average 46 1 removal rate was observed when phenanthrene was initially added at 1 376 mm with the abiotic losses and nitrate dependent losses being relatively insignificant with averages of 1 1 and 2 respectively fig s1 furthermore phen2 could biodegrade 45 8 of phenanthrene within 7 d but a biodegradation efficiency of 46 1 was achieved only on day 13 the average anaerobic phenanthrene degradation rate of strain phen2 was 46 5 51 μm d which is much higher than that of other reported pure cultures or highly enriched cultures which was 0 07 14 5 μm d liang et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 2021c the description of metabolic processes for anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 detected by metabolites genome and reverse transcription quantitative polymeric chain reaction rt qpcr is listed in supplementary materials text s4 after 13 d of anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation 14 81 17 31 mm nitrate consumption was observed in the phen2 culture coupled with anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation and no nitrate losses were found in the abiotic controls data not shown furthermore 9 9 10 6 mm nitrite was produced coupled with nitrate reduction by phen2 fig 1b strain phen2 consumed 24 5 25 9 mm of nitrate per mm of phenanthrene biodegradation indicating that a part of nitrate was not converted completely to nitrogen gas as the consumption amount of nitrate should be 13 2 mm when it is converted completely to nitrogen gas the production of a certain amount of nitrite also indicated that nitrate was not completely reduced during anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 the result of the nitrate conversion processes of phen2 was the same as a previously described highly enriched culture but differed from a previously described pure culture zhang et al 2020 2021c but the accumulation of nitrite was a common phenomenon during anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by the above cultures genome analyses for nitrate reduction showed that phen2 has a complete suite of genes responsible for nitrate transport and the conversion of nitrate to nitrogen table s2 but the accumulation of nitrite may be due to the low bioavailability of phenanthrene jiang et al 2020 lin et al 2019 smreczak et al 2008 the dominant bacterium in the enriched anammox culture belonged to candidatus kuenenia 47 93 relative abundance which belongs to a genus of anammox cultures and has been reported to be involved in the reduction of nitrite produced by anaerobic biodegradation of benzene or other organic matter han et al 2020 li et al 2018 the main reason could be that candidatus kuenenia had a high matrix tolerance of phenanthrene except for the dominant bacterium other bacteria with relatively high abundance in the enriched anammox culture included fusibacter 17 1 relative abundance geosporobacter 4 38 relative abundance tissierella 3 08 relative abundance parvibaculum 2 12 relative abundance oceanibaculum 2 08 relative abundance ignavibacterium 1 88 relative abundance pseudomonas 1 88 relative abundance and gp3 1 77 relative abundance which established a symbiotic system with candidatus kuenenia in addition the sum of other bacteria in the enriched anammox bacteria with abundances below 1 accounted for 17 1 of the microbial community fig 1c to test the activity of the enriched anammox culture the ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured every 2 h during the 12 h of culture the culture could decrease ammonia from a concentration of 9 9 mm to zero coupled with decreasing nitrite from a concentration of 13 1 mm to zero producing a 2 53 mm concentration of nitrate within 12 h fig 1d the activity of the anammox culture in this study falls between the reported activities of common anammox culture and high efficiency anammox culture kang et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 3 2 change in anammox culture activity upon phenanthrene inhibition and recovery whether phenanthrene a model of pah in this study affects anammox is still an open question including whether phenanthrene can inhibit the activity of anammox culture and the inhibitory effect of phenanthrene on the activity of anammox culture as shown in fig 2 a and b the ammonia and nitrite removal rates decreased when the anammox culture was inoculated with 1 4 mm phenanthrene with phenanthrene concentrations of 1 2 3 and 4 mm the anammox culture activity was inhibited by 5 1 12 1 14 1 24 2 71 6 89 9 and 91 8 97 5 compared with the control group without phenanthrene respectively which indicated that phenanthrene could truly affect the anammox culture activity and that the inhibitory effect was concentration dependent the relationship between the inhibition percentages of anammox culture activity and phenanthrene concentrations in the culture is shown in fig 2c which showed a weak linear correlation r2 0 77 0 81 as shown in fig 2d the phenanthrene absorbed on and into the anammox cells increased with increasing added concentration in the culture and the phenanthrene absorbed on and into the anammox cells showed a stronger linear correlation r2 0 99 with the inhibition percentage of anammox culture activity fig 2e which indicated that phenanthrene absorbed on and into the cells affected the anammox activity more directly than phenanthrene in the environment the activity of anammox culture was severely inhibited by an average of 15 2 mg gvss phenanthrene exposure and no recovery of anammox activity was observed after the inhibited anammox was inoculated in fresh medium for eight days fig 2f suggesting that the inhibition of anammox activity by phenanthrene was irreversible this was the same as the irreversible methanol inhibition that damaged the anammox bacteria from microbial poisoning or enzyme inactivation and was different from the reversible ethane inhibition isaka et al 2008 tan et al 2022 the reasons for the inhibition of anammox culture activity by phenanthrene may be cell lysis enzyme activity decreasing and blocking the transmission of ammonia and nitrite 3 3 influence of enriched anammox culture on anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation efficiency anammox bacteria percentage changes and inorganic carbon production the above enriched anammox culture was applied to construct the joint system with the isolated phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer phen2 after 16 days of cultivation the joint system that initially contained phen2 and enriched anammox culture with a vss ratio g g of 50 1 showed the highest phenanthrene degradation efficiency which was 1 94 fold higher than that of the phen2 culture alone meanwhile the phenanthrene degradation efficiencies of joint systems containing phen2 and enriched anammox cultures with initial vss ratios g g of 100 1 25 1 10 1 5 1 and 1 1 were 1 37 1 68 1 47 1 11 and 1 06 fold higher respectively than that of the phen2 culture alone fig 3 a this result suggests that 1 the anammox culture applied in this study could assist in anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by nitrate reducers which was newly reported and 2 few anammox bacteria are enough to construct an excellent performance of joint systems with nitrate reducers for anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation as shown in fig 3b the anammox bacteria percentage of the joint systems changed during the culture period in which the percentages of anammox bacteria of the joint systems with phen2 and enriched anammox culture with vss ratios g g of 100 1 initial 0 48 of anammox bacteria and 50 1 initial 0 94 of anammox bacteria increased whereas the others initial 1 88 4 22 7 86 and 22 87 of anammox bacteria declined the results further indicated that small amounts of anammox culture between 1 and 2 abundance were appropriate for the joint system to anaerobic biodegradation of phenanthrene as shown in fig 3c and d although the joint system of phen2 and anammox culture produced a few more amounts of inorganic carbon than phen2 alone the ratio of produced inorganic carbon and consumed phenanthrene was much lower in the joint system which indicated that the joint system produced much less inorganic carbon with the same phenanthrene consumption than phen2 alone in theory only biomass and nitrogen gas were produced when the phenanthrene ammonia nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the environment were in a ratio of 1 y z 1 32z 1 2k x x 0 26z and 5y 0 066z 14 as shown in eqs 1 3 among which c5h7o2n refers to the phen2 cell formulation and ch2o0 5n0 15

mm accumulated in the phen2 culture and less nitrite accumulation was found in the joint systems with anammox bacteria added which indicated that the anammox culture applied in this study could perform nitrite reduction activity in the presence of phenanthrene nitrite accumulation and incomplete biodegradation were observed during phen2 growth on phenanthrene which are phenomena frequently encountered in the biodegradation of refractory organic matter under nitrate reducing conditions burland and edwards 1999 dou et al 2009 keller et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 2021c nitrite accumulation could probably be ascribed to the low carbon bioavailability of refractory organic matter and incomplete biodegradation could be ascribed to the biotoxicity of accumulated nitrite to produce fna boiocchi et al 2017 hartop et al 2017 wang et al 2018b yu et al 2020 the free nitrous acid fna concentration of each culture was calculated according to the equation fna no 2 n exp 2300 273 t 1 0 ph kakar et al 2021 as many as 0 021 mg l fna existed in the phen2 culture on the 16th day which was much more than that in the joint systems 0 000042 0 0041 mg l table 1 3 4 inhibitory effect of nitrite on anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 as shown in fig 4 a phen2 could biodegrade an average of only 44 6 phenanthrene with an initial concentration of 1 39 mm whereas the joint system 1 50 mixture of enriched anammox culture and phen2 could biodegrade an average of 86 7 phenanthrene with an initial concentration of 1 43 mm within 16 days the joint system facilitated approximately 94 4 phenanthrene degradation efficiency additionally the biodegradation of phenanthrene by phen2 almost stopped at day 8 for an unknown reason whereas phenanthrene biodegradation by the joint system could continue as shown in fig 4b the enriched anammox culture had no ability to biodegrade phenanthrene therefore the promoted biodegradation efficiency was not induced by the biodegradation of phenanthrene by the added enriched anammox culture remarkably the joint system not only effectively facilitated the biodegradation efficiency of phenanthrene but also reduced nitrite accumulation by 85 3 fig 4c our results also showed that anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation was affected by nitrite concentrations as shown in fig 4d the anaerobic biodegradation rate of phenanthrene was 92 5 μm d when the concentration of nitrite was zero and the biodegradation rate was almost zero when the nitrite concentration reached 12 mm furthermore the anaerobic biodegradation rate of phenanthrene showed a negative linear relationship with the nitrite concentrations when the concentrations of nitrite ranged from 0 to 7 mm the results suggested that the presence of nitrite could inhibit further biodegradation or the biodegradation rate of phenanthrene by a nitrate reducer anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 was completely inhibited when the nitrite concentration reached 11 6 12 mm at ph 7 2 and 32 c and the calculated fna concentration was 0 021 mgn l which is similar to the concentration when the activity of some denitrifying bacteria was completely restrained wang et al 2018b zhou et al 2011 3 5 synergistic mechanism of phen2 and anammox culture as shown in fig 5 phen2 could utilize phenanthrene as the carbon source with the reduction of nitrate to produce inorganic carbon nitrite and nitrogen inorganic carbon could be utilized for the cell growth of anammox culture and nitrite could be used to produce nitrogen and nitrate coupled with ammonia oxidation by anammox bacteria among which nitrate could return to phen2 culture in summary phenanthrene nitrate ammonia and nitrite could be utilized by the joint system anammox bacteria and phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer phen2 to only produce nitrogen gas and biomass the inorganic carbon was partly removed in this study fig 3c because the nitrite produced by phen2 during anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation was not enough for inorganic carbon utilization by anammox bacteria complete inorganic carbon fixation to form biomass may occur when a certain amount of nitrite is also present in the environment in other words the joint system can simultaneously remove nitrite from the environment in summary a c and n cycle can be formed by the joint system which cannot only bioremediate pah ammonia nitrate and nitrite pollutants but also decrease nitrite and inorganic carbon emissions the synergistic metabolic processes could exist in the real environments as a part of the recirculation of substances the limiting conditions for the cycle included 1 pah ammonia nitrite or not and nitrate simultaneously exist in the environment 2 less than 12 mm nitrite exists in the environment and 3 less than 15 2 mg gvss phenanthrene is absorbed on and into the cells of the environment as shown in table 2 complete removal of phenanthrene and nitrite was observed within 24 days when the initial phen2 culture and enriched anammox culture vss ratio g g was 50 1 and complete or nearly complete removal of phenanthrene and nitrite was observed within 28 days when the initial phen2 culture and enriched anammox culture vss ratios g g were 100 1 25 1 10 1 5 1 and 1 1 in the phen2 culture alone in contrast only 44 4 44 8 of phenanthrene was removed and 11 5 11 6 mm nitrite accumulated in the supernatant the results indicate that other initial vss ratios except 50 1 of phen2 culture and enriched anammox culture can also achieve the complete removal of phenanthrene for a longer time which may be caused by the growth of phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer and community succession of other initial vss ratios of cultures anammox bacteria candidatus kuenenia in this study cannot only assist the biodegradation of phenanthrene by nitrate reducers but also reduce the accumulation of nitrite and the production of inorganic carbon meanwhile the anammox culture used in this study does not have the ability to degrade phenanthrene which indicates that the anammox culture assists phenanthrene biodegradation by reducing nitrite in the culture for the total metabolic processes anammox culture can utilize the inorganic carbon and nitrite gao et al 2012 kuenen 2008 produced by phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducers and produce some nitrate to return to phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducers as the terminal electron acceptor to degrade phenanthrene although the activity of most anammox bacteria tends to be inhibited by organic matter especially toxic organic matter cho et al 2019 jin et al 2012 nguyen and tran 2021 an anammox culture in the current study mainly comprising candidatus kuenenia that was enriched from a phenanthrene degrading and nitrate reducing consortia was newly verified to maintain activity in the presence of phenanthrene and metabolites of anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation by phen2 4 conclusions collectively our results newly indicated that one anammox culture that mainly contained candidatus kuenenia could co operate with a nitrate reducer for anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation meanwhile the inhibitory effects of phenanthrene a model of pah in this study on an anammox culture and nitrite on a phenanthrene degrading nitrate reducer were newly discussed in addition our findings provided a new strategy by the cooperation of anammox culture and nitrate reducer for the bioremediation of pah pollution in anaerobic environments to solve the problem of nitrite accumulation incomplete biodegradation of pah and production of inorganic carbon which is extremely beneficial to our environment meanwhile our findings can also provide some guidance for the bioremediation of anaerobic environments simultaneously polluted by pah ammonia nitrate and nitrite although important discoveries were revealed by this study there are also limitations first whether other kinds of anammox bacteria can cooperate with nitrate reducers for anaerobic pah biodegradation needs to be further studied second other kinds of pahs especially high molecular weight pahs which are of great concern to researchers need to be further studied including nitrate reducing degraders and anammox bacteria that can keep activity and contribute to the biodegradation third whether the joint systems can be applied in the real world need to be studied in the future

15182,this work is focused on improving the understanding of the complex water matrix interactions occurring during the removal of a microcontaminants mixture acetamiprid carbamazepine and caffeine by solar fe3 edds persulfate process the individual and combined effects of sulfates 100 500 mg l nitrates 20 160 mg l bicarbonates 77 770 mg l and chlorides 300 1500 mg l were assessed by comparing the outcomes obtained in different synthetic and actual water matrices in general the results showed negligible effects of the different anions on fe3 edds concentration and ps consumption profiles while the combination of bicarbonates and chlorides seemed to be the key for the mc removal efficiency decrease found when working with complex matrixes finally the influence of dissolved organic matter on process performance was evaluated it was concluded that there is neither any influence of this variable on fe3 edds concentration and ps consumption profiles in contrast there was a general negative effect on mc removal efficiency which strongly depended on both the concentration and composition of the dissolved organic matter graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords persulfate water matrix contaminants of emerging concern wastewater data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the concern for a new group of pollutants found in different types of water at very low concentration known as contaminants of emerging concern or microcontaminants mcs has grown exponentially in last decades associated to an enhancement of the humanity well being many mcs which include pharmaceuticals and personal care products antibiotics pesticides food additives fire retardant endocrine disrupting drugs of abuse and other recalcitrant organic chemicals are toxic non biodegrade and persistent consequently their bioaccumulation cause problems in the environment and human health due to their very low concentration in water µg l ng l it has not been possible to systematically detect them until recent years despite mcs being for sure present in water bodies since many decades ago thanks to the continuous advances in the analytical chemistry field this environmental problem was raised once the detection techniques demonstrated the occurrence of mc and therefore the scientific community started to study new technologies for its degradation and elimination han et al 2015 acero et al 2018 wang and wang 2018 lado ribeiro et al 2019 many technologies such as activated carbon adsorption ozonation membrane processes and advanced oxidation processes aops have already shown their ability to isolate or to eliminate mcs from water aops are based on hydroxyl radical ho formation which is a strong oxidant specie with a redox potential e0 in the range of 1 8 2 7 v depending on ph fang et al 2012 according to the ho production method aops are classified into chemical photochemical sonochemical and electrochemical processes molinari et al 2017 lately sulfate radical so4 based processes have received increasing attention as an alternative to ho due to the high redox potential of so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v the reactivity of so4 does not depend on ph and it can also react with h2o in a wide ph range yielding ho r 1 2 neta et al 1988 matzek and carter 2016 at circumneutral ph so4 can be more reactive than ho since it is established that the e0 of so4 is higher than e0 of ho oh et al 2016 while the non selective reactivity of ho is very well known neta et al 1977 tully et al 1981 the so4 is electrophilic and its attack through an electron transfer mechanism is very selective and specific with some electron donor groups oh nh2 or or π electrons of aromatic molecules and other compounds with unsaturated bonds in contrast the reaction of so4 with groups such as nitro no2 and carbonyl c o is normally slower oh et al 2016 additionally the so4 has a long useful life t1 2 30 40 µs with respect to ho t1 2 1 µs which allows additional interactions olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 in this context peroxydisulfate based aops are gaining interest as an option for mcs control in water treatments r 3 the so4 is commonly generated from peroxydisulfate ion ps s2o8 2 acero et al 2018 that needs to be activated there are different activation mechanisms uv light ligand to metal charge transfer iron cobalt copper zinc and manganese photocatalytic heat ultrasound microwave alkaline ph carbonaceous based materials and hybrid methods oh et al 2016 matzek and carter 2016 among them some of the most interesting activation mechanisms are probably those based on photocatalysis because solar radiation can be used as energy source this is the case of ps activation by the fe3 edds complex in combination with solar radiation which has already shown its potential for the removal of mcs miralles cuevas et al 2019 in this process the use of edds as iron complexing agent allows working at circumneutral ph because the direct use of fe3 is not possible since it is only soluble at acidic ph detailed information about the reaction mechanism of the solar fe3 edds ps process is described elsewhere miralles cuevas et al 2019 r1 so4 h2o so4 2 ho h r2 so4 oh so4 2 ho r3 so4 mc reaction intermediates so4 2 on the other hand inorganic and organic components present in water matrices can affect the degradation of mcs lado ribeiro et al 2019 some anions such as sulfate bicarbonate and chloride can act as ho scavengers producing less powerful oxidants thus reducing the degradation kinetics márquez brazón et al 2016 they can also affect ps based aops reacting with so4 the effect of natural organic matter nom on mc removal in water is contradictory aliste et al 2020 2021 the components of nom include a wide range of humic fulvic and humic acids and non humic carbohydrates proteins etc substances in general the presence of representative nom substances hinders the elimination of mcs because they can consume ho and or so4 acero et al 2018 lado ribeiro et al 2019 however under some conditions the presence of nom in water can increase the degradation rate of some mcs halladja et al 2007 in these reactions nom acts as a primary chromophore that influences direct photochemical transformations through bonding interactions or indirectly by generating some reactive oxygen species ros and other reaction intermediates including organic radicals mostofa et al 2013 cabrera reina et al 2018 according to acero et al 2018 and depending on the mcs chemical structure carbonate bicarbonate anions and humic acids are the two main components of the water matrix that have impact on the abatement of mcs by uv ps processes with chloride showing a lower impact and sulfate and nitrate presenting negligible effects the initial goal of this work was to delve into the individual effects of sulfates nitrates carbonates bicarbonates and chlorides the most common water matrix inorganic components on the degradation of a mcs mixture by solar fe3 edds ps process acetamiprid ace neonicotinoid insecticide caffeine caf psychoactive drug and carbamazepine carb anticonvulsant drug were used as model of mcs after carefully analyzing the effect of these anions on process performance the combined effect of anions and organic matter was assessed by selecting multiple synthetic and actual water matrices to improve the understanding of the complex interactions occurring in the solar fe3 edds ps process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical

preparing simulated waters were provided by sigma aldrich and panreac 2 2 water matrices the first experiments focused on the study of the individual effects of the inorganic ions usually present in water matrices were carried out in demineralized water at different concentrations of sulfate nitrate bicarbonate and chloride at circumneutral ph in these experiments the bicarbonate concentration was always set to 77 mg l to buffer the ph except in the bicarbonate experimental series in which higher concentrations of bicarbonates were studied this concentration is equivalent to 15 mg l of total inorganic carbon tic that is a lumped parameter commonly used to express the carbonate bicarbonate content because it is easily determined afterwards eight different water matrices were used 1

concentrations were determined with a metrohm 850 professional ic configured for gradient analysis following the method proposed by roccamante et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of anions on solar fe3 edds ps process performance the impact of the inorganic components of the water matrix on the removal of mcs by aops is complex and not deeply studied yet the formation of ros from some of these components or the presence of iron ions among many others may cause an improvement of process performance in contrast scavenging effects or iron complexation also among many others may be negative for process efficiency in this way the water matrix can have neutral promoting or inhibiting effect depending on many factors lado ribeiro et al 2019 in this context different series of experiments were carried out to account for the individual role of sulfate so4 2 100 250 400 and 550 mg l nitrate no3 20 40 60 80 120 and 160 mg l bicarbonate expressed as tic 15 50 100 and 150 mg l and chloride cl 300 700 1100 and 1500 mg l in usual ranges found in many natural waters and treated municipal wastewater as detailed in the following subsections 3 1 1 so4 2 effects the resulting removal of mcs total sum σmcs after 5 min of reaction time was 91 94 96 90 and 95 for the 0 100 250 450 and 550 mg l of sulfate concentration respectively data not shown therefore mcs removal efficiency was not affected by sulfate concentration within the range studied the average pseudo first order kinetic constant of the whole experimental series for the removal of σmcs was 0 59 0 03 min 1 ghauch and tuqan 2012 did neither found any negative effect on the heat activated ps process when they studied caso4 role in bisoprolol degradation rate liu et al 2016 and zhang et al 2016 also found a negligible influence of sulfates on the uv activated ps process based on these reports as well as on the results found in this work it can be assumed that sulfate impact on activated ps processes summarized on r 4 neta et al 1988 and r 5 buxton et al 1988 is very low including this particular case in which ps is activated by the fe3 edds complex under simulated solar light regarding the individual behaviour of the mcs there were very small differences between them since all three compounds were rapidly removed in any case caf was found to be the most persistent mc followed by ace and carb caf is commonly used as a chemical reference for domestic wastewater contamination buerge et al 2003 and it has been previously recommended as a good indicator of process performance in the context of aops kowalska et al 2021 on the other hand almost identical fe3 edds degradation and ps consumption profiles were found independently of the selected sulfate concentration data not shown the average ps consumption at the end of the experiments was 66 8 although the consumption was substantially lower after 5 min 30 when mcs removal was almost complete the fe3 edds complex was completely removed after 30 min of reaction time in all cases and from that moment ps consumption practically stopped r4 so4 2 ho so4 oh r5 so4 2 so4 s2o8 2 eaq 3 1 2 no3 effect as occurred with sulfates mcs removal efficiency was not affected by nitrate concentration within the range studied being the average removal percentage for the σmcs 99 2 at the end of the assays although degradations above 89 were always obtained after only 5 min data not shown the average pseudo first order kinetic constant for the removal of σmcs was 0 54 0 03 min 1 almost equivalent to the one found in the sulfate experimental series the fe3 edds complex and ps decreased from the beginning of the experiments data not shown none of these variables was seriously affected by the nitrate concentration the average ps consumption at the end of the experiments was 73 13 which seems to slightly increase with respect to the sulfate experimental series while fe3 edds complex was almost completely removed from the reaction bulk after 30 min of reaction time in all cases on the one hand this anion did not significantly quench the sulfate and hydroxyl radicals generated but on the other hand the nitrate excitation under uv irradiation which yields various reactive species was neither relevant for process efficiency these results agree with other studies based on uv uv h2o2 and uv ps processes he et al 2014 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 acero et al 2018 where nitrate anions were labelled as non influencer ions because the two possible side reactions with ho and so4 r 6 7 presented very slow reaction rates løgager et al 1993 zhou et al 2018 caf was again the most persistent pollutant followed by ace and carb which was the most rapidly removed mc r6 no3 ho no3 oh r7 no3 so4 no3 so4 2 3 1 3 co3 2 hco3 effects an overall negative impact of carbonate bicarbonate anions on the sulfate based aops has been traditionally assumed bennedsen et al 2012 fig 1 left shows how the removal of the σmcs is affected by tic concentration which was varied between 15 and 150 mg l notice that tic is a lumped measurement of carbonates bicarbonates content the σmcs removal proportionally decreased from 95 to 83 after 5 min of reaction time as carbonates content increased despite this at the end of the experiments 60 min the σmcs attained 99 removal in the assays done with 15 and 50 mg l of tic while the removal for the 100 and 150 mg l of tic assays was 98 and 94 respectively the σmcs removal kinetic constant proportionally decreased as tic increased resulting in 0 58 0 46 0 43 and 0 31 min 1 this efficiency decrease did not affect equally each mc while carb was substantially removed in less than 5 min of reaction time in all cases caf and ace removal efficiency significantly decreased as tic concentration increased especially for ace the undesirable effect of carbonate bicarbonate on mcs removal has been summarized in four possible mechanisms i competition reactions between mcs and carbonate bicarbonate for principal radicals ho and so4 r 8 12 ii formation of carbonate radical co3 which is much less reactive and more selective than ho and so4 r 8 11 iii an excessive increase of ph that impedes the action of so4 and iv absorption or scattering of uv radiation by bicarbonates bennedsen et al 2012 acero et al 2018 lebik elhadi et al 2020 despite all this some electron rich mcs have a strong affinity for carbonate radicals improving their removal indeed acero et al 2018 who studied the uv activated ps process observed how the increasing amount of bicarbonate anion had an inhibitory effect on the removal of some of the contaminants but it also had a positive effect on others therefore depending on the chemical structure of the mcs the carbonate bicarbonate effect will be neutral positive or negative for the degradation rate of mcs which makes it very difficult to predict under actual conditions due to the complex mixtures of mcs always present in mwwtp secondary effluents bennedsen et al 2012 acero et al 2018 lebik elhadi et al 2020 fe3 edds complex fig 1 right decreased from the beginning of the treatment and it was removed 98 from the reaction bulk after 30 min in each case ps average consumption was 65 10 in this way neither fe3 edds complex degradation nor ps consumption were substantially affected by the carbonates bicarbonates concentration r8 co3 2 ho co3 ho r9 co3 2 so4 co3 so4 2 r10 hco3 ho h2o co3 r11 hco3 so4 co3 so4 2 h r12 hco3 so4 hco3 so4 2 3 1 4 cl effects radical scavenging by cl in so4 based aops is a major challenge if compared to ho based aops the reaction between cl and ho yields clho r 13 however this is a reversible reaction that mostly reverts to ho buxton et al 1988 in contrast so4 produces cl through one electron abstraction from cl r 14 which is often reflected in lower efficiencies in the removal of organic pollutants as well as higher generation of reactive chlorine species cl2 clo2 clo and cloh chawla and fessenden 1975 lee et al 2020 chloride concentration in the water matrix was increased from 300 to 1500 mg l resulting in a very similar and fast degradation of the σmcs to an average value of 62 2 in the first 5 min fig 2 left from that moment the σmcs degradation rate slowed down so that 74 2 was the final σmcs removal at 60 min of reaction time although negligible differences for the σmcs degradation profiles were found between the experiments carried out at different concentrations of chloride the mcs removal efficiency significantly decreased with respect to the rest of experimental series shown in previous sections indeed the average kinetic constant for the σmcs removal was 0 062 0 007 min 1 which is about ten times lower than the ones found in the previous experiments fe3 edds concentration profiles did not show any difference with respect to the experimental series also shown in previous sections fig 2 right neither ps consumptions showed significant differences the fe3 edds complex concentration decreased from the beginning of the treatment until 99 disappearing from the reaction bulk after 30 min the average ps consumption for all the assays was 58 11 for a better understanding of these results an individual analysis about the behavior of each pollutant is needed fig 3 ace was the most affected mc by the presence of chlorides while it showed more than 99 removal in 20 min in the absence of chlorides this value was never achieved in any other assay even after 60 min the final removal percentages for ace were 32 26 13 and 19 when 300 700 1100 and 1500 mg l of chloride were added respectively thus ace degradation efficiency diminished as the chloride concentration increased which can be justified by the low reactivity of the pyridine ring of its chemical structure as occurred in the work carried out by vallés et al 2021 when treating a mixture of mcs by photo fenton process conversely the increase of chloride concentration favored caf and carb degradation while 30 and 20 min were needed to achieve 90 degradation at the lowest chloride concentration respectively these times diminished to 15 and 10 min for the highest chloride concentration thus no substantial difference between the σmcs removal profiles was found because the decrease in ace degradation rate was compensated by the improvement of caf and carb removal which demonstrated to be more susceptible to oxidation by chlorine species compared to so4 it is interesting to note that lee et al 2020 reported that this has caused some erroneous claims of the positive effects of chlorides on ps based aops in any case as occurred with carbonates these results show the high complexity of predicting the impact of even a solely anion on mcs removal r13 cl ho cloh r14 cl so4 cl so4 2 3 2 combined effect of anions in different water matrices after studying the individual effects of the most important inorganic anions on the solar fe3 edds ps process their combined effect was then assessed by selecting different water matrices with significantly different physic chemical characteristics thus a new experimental series was carried out with the same pollutants ace caf and carb at the same initial concentrations 200 µg l each but changing the water matrix as follows i sfw ii nw iii 1 2nw iv 1 4nw and v snf concentrate the results corresponding to the decontamination process expressed as the normalized removal profile of the ʃmcs and the normalized average decrease of fe3 edds complex and ps concentrations are presented in fig 4 the water matrices which basically differed in the inorganic content had no significant influence on the fe3 edds complex concentration evolution indeed the fe3 edds complex decrease was always 99 in 30 min and the decontamination process stopped from that moment due to the absence of iron in solution since there were no important differences between fe3 edds profiles neither there were substantial differences between ps consumptions the average ps consumption of the whole experimental series was 57 7 mg l in contrast the water matrix did present a substantial effect on ʃmc removal being always ace the most affected mc followed by caf and finally carb while 80 ʃmc removal was achieved for sfw and snf concentrate after 5 and 10 min of reaction time respectively this value could not be achieved for any of the experiments carried out in nw neither when it was diluted the ʃmc removal levels at the end of the treatment 60 min for nw 1 2nw and 1 4nw were 49 54 and 65 respectively regarding the individual behaviour of the mcs ace was by far the most recalcitrant pollutant followed by caf and carb fig s1 supplementary material since the fe3 edds concentration profiles and ps consumption curves were extremely similar for all the experiments the differences found in the ʃmc removal profiles should be mainly attributed to the side reactions in which the so4 is transformed into less reactive species as occurred when studying the individual effects of the different anions present in the water matrix it can be concluded the low impact of nitrates and sulfates on process performance despite snf concentrate showing the highest concentrations of the whole experimental series for these two components 62 and 1314 mg l respectively the ʃmc removal rate was much higher k 0 19 min 1 than the ones obtained with actual waters k 0 012 min 1 k 0 015 min 1 and k 0 025 min 1 for nw 1 2nw and 1 4nw respectively for which the highest concentrations of these anions corresponding to nw were under detection limit and 162 mg l following the same order disregarding any significant effect of nitrates and sulfates the justification of the obtained results needs to be focused on carbonates and chlorides content according to the results found when assessing the individual effects of anions chlorides presented the most significant impact on process performance however the second fastest ʃmc removal rate in this experimental series was obtained with the snf concentrate water matrix despite presenting the highest chloride concentration this can be only justified by the extremely low concentration of carbonates in the snf concentrate 2 mg l that caused the decrease of the ph during the process from 6 4 to 4 1 the rest of assays presented a stable ph around 7 5 8 somehow this variation of ph allowed substantially neutralizing the negative effect of chlorides on process performance although a common strategy when using aops for mc removal in actual mwwtp effluents is to diminish the tic content of the water matrix to 15 mg l cabrera reina et al 2021 these results suggest that decreasing the carbonates concentration to a minimum content could result in a significant advantage that deserves further attention if the carbonates bicarbonates content is not enough to buffer the ph it will naturally decrease during the process and therefore the negative impact of chlorides will be also minimized the presence of high chloride concentrations has been reported to increase mineralization rates in photo fenton process when carried out at acidic ph zapata et al 2009 according to the mechanism proposed elsewhere le truong et al 2004 in a similar way this could positively contribute to remove mcs in the solar fe3 edds ps process on the other hand the slowest ʃmc removal rate was found for nw which is coherent with its high content of carbonates and chlorides 879 mg l and 258 mg l respectively furthermore the higher the nw dilution the higher the ʃmc removal rate finally the results corresponding to the sfw k 0 31 min 1 assay are also in agreement with the importance of the coupled effect of carbonates and chlorides for the solar fe3 edds ps process the low content of carbonates 13 4 mg l in terms of tic combined with the low content of chlorides 3 7 mg l resulted in the fastest ʃmc removal rate of the whole experimental series 3 3 the effect of dissolved organic matter in addition to the important influence of the inorganic components present in the water matrix it is well known that dom accompanying the mcs also presents a critical impact on aops performance lado ribeiro et al 2019 although irradiation of waters including dom yields the photochemical generation of highly reactive species such as singlet oxygen 1o2 or ho vione et al 2014 the contribution of these radicals to mcs removal in so4 based aops will probably be negligible due to the low concentration of radicals produced from dom in contrast dom is an efficient scavenger of so4 and other radicals that may be generated due to so4 interaction with water matrix and acts as solar radiation filter so that a substantial decrease of aops efficiency can be inferred in the present study further experiments were carried out in the presence of dom specifically i 15 mg l of dom added as a mixture of organic content sources in demineralized water with carbonates 15 mg l expressed as tic ii synthetic mwwtp secondary effluent and iii actual mwwtp secondary effluent despite all three matrices presenting different inorganic and organic content the results did not show any significant difference on the fe3 edds complex removal and ps consumption profiles fig 5 right in each case fe3 edds complex disappeared in more than 99 from the reaction bulk after 30 min and the final ps consumption was 70 16 it was previously demonstrated that the effect of the inorganic components on these variables is negligible therefore the same conclusion can be drawn for dom content in this way the important differences found in ʃmc removal as fig 5 left shows can be mainly attributed to the interaction between water matrix components and the generated so4 radicals plus the increase of turbidity in the case of mwwtp secondary effluents both synthetic and actual as occurred in the previous experimental series ace was always the most affected mc followed by caf and finally carb fig s2 supplementary material although the ʃmcs could be almost completely removed 97 after 60 min of reaction time in the experiment with demineralized water with 15 mg l tic and 15 mg l dom the presence of dom represented a small delay k 0 18 min 1 with respect to the conditions under which the fastest removal rates of the whole work were obtained k 0 6 min 1 in the synthetic mwwtp secondary effluent experiment ʃmc only reached 61 removal at the end of the assay this removal efficiency is 14 lower than the one obtained in the assay from the chlorides experimental series that presented the same carbonate and chloride concentrations but no dom 75 ʃmc removal this is in agreement with the values of kinetics constants 0 062 min 1 in the chlorides experimental series and 0 018 min 1 in the mwwtp secondary effluent experiment thus it can be concluded that there is a negative contribution of dom due to radical scavenging and turbidity increase it is important to note that although the doc concentration of the added dom experiment and the synthetic mwwtp secondary effluent were equivalent the negative effect of dom in the latter was significantly higher in this way not only the dom concentration is critical for process performance but also its composition this is also in accordance with the results obtained in the actual mwwtp secondary effluent assay being its inorganic and organic species concentrations very similar to the ones of the synthetic mwwtp secondary effluent the final ʃmc removal only reached 36 therefore this poor process performance can be only caused by the type and organic composition of actual dom the lowest pseudo first order kinetic constant was found in the actual mwwtp secondary effluent assay concretely 0 007 min 1 unlike the results found for inorganic species when the negative influence was mainly related to the lower ace removal rate all three mcs were equally affected by dom presence 4 conclusions it has been observed that under the conditions studied sulfates nitrates carbonates bicarbonates and chlorides present no significant influence on the fe3 edds concentration evolution nor on ps consumption neither when some of these are present in the water matrix at the same time therefore the effect of water matrix inorganic components on the solar fe3 edds ps process could be mainly defined as the interaction of the components of the matrix with the oxidizing radicals that are generated during the process regarding mc removal nitrate and sulfate have shown no substantial effect on process efficiency while carbonate and chloride high concentrations probed to have a general negative influence although it was dependent on the chemical structure of the mc in this context the joint influence of carbonates and chlorides seemed to be the key variable for mc removal efficiency in addition the results demonstrated that the negative effect of chlorides could be minimized if the carbonate content is low enough for not buffering the ph the mechanism related to this process performance improvement as well as the possible formation of chlorinated intermediates are interesting issues to be studied in the future it was also concluded that the effect of the organic matter strongly depends on both the concentration and composition of the dom this work gave new insights on the solar fe3 edds ps process and its complex reaction mechanism facilitating the understanding of future works when using actual water matrixes and providing valuable information for the development of kinetic models or new operation strategies to optimize process efficiency this information should be cross linked with other studies dealing with intermediate evaluation and toxicity evolution during the process

15182,this work is focused on improving the understanding of the complex water matrix interactions occurring during the removal of a microcontaminants mixture acetamiprid carbamazepine and caffeine by solar fe3 edds persulfate process the individual and combined effects of sulfates 100 500 mg l nitrates 20 160 mg l bicarbonates 77 770 mg l and chlorides 300 1500 mg l were assessed by comparing the outcomes obtained in different synthetic and actual water matrices in general the results showed negligible effects of the different anions on fe3 edds concentration and ps consumption profiles while the combination of bicarbonates and chlorides seemed to be the key for the mc removal efficiency decrease found when working with complex matrixes finally the influence of dissolved organic matter on process performance was evaluated it was concluded that there is neither any influence of this variable on fe3 edds concentration and ps consumption profiles in contrast there was a general negative effect on mc removal efficiency which strongly depended on both the concentration and composition of the dissolved organic matter graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords persulfate water matrix contaminants of emerging concern wastewater data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction the concern for a new group of pollutants found in different types of water at very low concentration known as contaminants of emerging concern or microcontaminants mcs has grown exponentially in last decades associated to an enhancement of the humanity well being many mcs which include pharmaceuticals and personal care products antibiotics pesticides food additives fire retardant endocrine disrupting drugs of abuse and other recalcitrant organic chemicals are toxic non biodegrade and persistent consequently their bioaccumulation cause problems in the environment and human health due to their very low concentration in water µg l ng l it has not been possible to systematically detect them until recent years despite mcs being for sure present in water bodies since many decades ago thanks to the continuous advances in the analytical chemistry field this environmental problem was raised once the detection techniques demonstrated the occurrence of mc and therefore the scientific community started to study new technologies for its degradation and elimination han et al 2015 acero et al 2018 wang and wang 2018 lado ribeiro et al 2019 many technologies such as activated carbon adsorption ozonation membrane processes and advanced oxidation processes aops have already shown their ability to isolate or to eliminate mcs from water aops are based on hydroxyl radical ho formation which is a strong oxidant specie with a redox potential e0 in the range of 1 8 2 7 v depending on ph fang et al 2012 according to the ho production method aops are classified into chemical photochemical sonochemical and electrochemical processes molinari et al 2017 lately sulfate radical so4 based processes have received increasing attention as an alternative to ho due to the high redox potential of so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v the reactivity of so4 does not depend on ph and it can also react with h2o in a wide ph range yielding ho r 1 2 neta et al 1988 matzek and carter 2016 at circumneutral ph so4 can be more reactive than ho since it is established that the e0 of so4 is higher than e0 of ho oh et al 2016 while the non selective reactivity of ho is very well known neta et al 1977 tully et al 1981 the so4 is electrophilic and its attack through an electron transfer mechanism is very selective and specific with some electron donor groups oh nh2 or or π electrons of aromatic molecules and other compounds with unsaturated bonds in contrast the reaction of so4 with groups such as nitro no2 and carbonyl c o is normally slower oh et al 2016 additionally the so4 has a long useful life t1 2 30 40 µs with respect to ho t1 2 1 µs which allows additional interactions olmez hanci and arslan alaton 2013 in this context peroxydisulfate based aops are gaining interest as an option for mcs control in water treatments r 3 the so4 is commonly generated from peroxydisulfate ion ps s2o8 2 acero et al 2018 that needs to be activated there are different activation mechanisms uv light ligand to metal charge transfer iron cobalt copper zinc and manganese photocatalytic heat ultrasound microwave alkaline ph carbonaceous based materials and hybrid methods oh et al 2016 matzek and carter 2016 among them some of the most interesting activation mechanisms are probably those based on photocatalysis because solar radiation can be used as energy source this is the case of ps activation by the fe3 edds complex in combination with solar radiation which has already shown its potential for the removal of mcs miralles cuevas et al 2019 in this process the use of edds as iron complexing agent allows working at circumneutral ph because the direct use of fe3 is not possible since it is only soluble at acidic ph detailed information about the reaction mechanism of the solar fe3 edds ps process is described elsewhere miralles cuevas et al 2019 r1 so4 h2o so4 2 ho h r2 so4 oh so4 2 ho r3 so4 mc reaction intermediates so4 2 on the other hand inorganic and organic components present in water matrices can affect the degradation of mcs lado ribeiro et al 2019 some anions such as sulfate bicarbonate and chloride can act as ho scavengers producing less powerful oxidants thus reducing the degradation kinetics márquez brazón et al 2016 they can also affect ps based aops reacting with so4 the effect of natural organic matter nom on mc removal in water is contradictory aliste et al 2020 2021 the components of nom include a wide range of humic fulvic and humic acids and non humic carbohydrates proteins etc substances in general the presence of representative nom substances hinders the elimination of mcs because they can consume ho and or so4 acero et al 2018 lado ribeiro et al 2019 however under some conditions the presence of nom in water can increase the degradation rate of some mcs halladja et al 2007 in these reactions nom acts as a primary chromophore that influences direct photochemical transformations through bonding interactions or indirectly by generating some reactive oxygen species ros and other reaction intermediates including organic radicals mostofa et al 2013 cabrera reina et al 2018 according to acero et al 2018 and depending on the mcs chemical structure carbonate bicarbonate anions and humic acids are the two main components of the water matrix that have impact on the abatement of mcs by uv ps processes with chloride showing a lower impact and sulfate and nitrate presenting negligible effects the initial goal of this work was to delve into the individual effects of sulfates nitrates carbonates bicarbonates and chlorides the most common water matrix inorganic components on the degradation of a mcs mixture by solar fe3 edds ps process acetamiprid ace neonicotinoid insecticide caffeine caf psychoactive drug and carbamazepine carb anticonvulsant drug were used as model of mcs after carefully analyzing the effect of these anions on process performance the combined effect of anions and organic matter was assessed by selecting multiple synthetic and actual water matrices to improve the understanding of the complex interactions occurring in the solar fe3 edds ps process 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical

water matrices were carried out in demineralized water at different concentrations of sulfate nitrate bicarbonate and chloride at circumneutral ph in these experiments the bicarbonate concentration was always set to 77 mg l to buffer the ph except in the bicarbonate experimental series in which higher concentrations of bicarbonates were studied this concentration is equivalent to 15 mg l of total inorganic carbon tic that is a lumped parameter commonly used to express the carbonate bicarbonate content because it is easily determined afterwards eight different water matrices were used 1

concentrations were determined with a metrohm 850 professional ic configured for gradient analysis following the method proposed by roccamante et al 2022 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of anions on solar fe3 edds ps process performance the impact of the inorganic components of the water matrix on the removal of mcs by aops is complex and not deeply studied yet the formation of ros from some of these components or the presence of iron ions among many others may cause an improvement of process performance in contrast scavenging effects or iron complexation also among many others may be negative for process efficiency in this way the water matrix can have neutral promoting or inhibiting effect depending on many factors lado ribeiro et al 2019 in this context different series of experiments were carried out to account for the individual role of sulfate so4 2 100 250 400 and 550 mg l nitrate no3 20 40 60 80 120 and 160 mg l bicarbonate expressed as tic 15 50 100 and 150 mg l and chloride cl 300 700 1100 and 1500 mg l in usual ranges found in many natural waters and treated municipal wastewater as detailed in the following subsections 3 1 1 so4 2 effects the resulting removal of mcs total sum σmcs after 5 min of reaction time was 91 94 96 90 and 95 for the 0 100 250 450 and 550 mg l of sulfate concentration respectively data not shown therefore mcs removal efficiency was not affected by sulfate concentration within the range studied the average pseudo first order kinetic constant of the whole experimental series for the removal of σmcs was 0 59 0 03 min 1 ghauch and tuqan 2012 did neither found any negative effect on the heat activated ps process when they studied caso4 role in bisoprolol degradation rate liu et al 2016 and zhang et al 2016 also found a negligible influence of sulfates on the uv activated ps process based on these reports as well as on the results found in this work it can be assumed that sulfate impact on activated ps processes summarized on r 4 neta et al 1988 and r 5 buxton et al 1988 is very low including this particular case in which ps is activated by the fe3 edds complex under simulated solar light regarding the individual behaviour of the mcs there were very small differences between them since all three compounds were rapidly removed in any case caf was found to be the most persistent mc followed by ace and carb caf is commonly used as a chemical reference for domestic wastewater contamination buerge et al 2003 and it has been previously recommended as a good indicator of process performance in the context of aops kowalska et al 2021 on the other hand almost identical fe3 edds degradation and ps consumption profiles were found independently of the selected sulfate concentration data not shown the average ps consumption at the end of the experiments was 66 8 although the consumption was substantially lower after 5 min 30 when mcs removal was almost complete the fe3 edds complex was completely removed after 30 min of reaction time in all cases and from that moment ps consumption practically stopped r4 so4 2 ho so4 oh r5 so4 2 so4 s2o8 2 eaq 3 1 2 no3 effect as occurred with sulfates mcs removal efficiency was not affected by nitrate concentration within the range studied being the average removal percentage for the σmcs 99 2 at the end of the assays although degradations above 89 were always obtained after only 5 min data not shown the average pseudo first order kinetic constant for the removal of σmcs was 0 54 0 03 min 1 almost equivalent to the one found in the sulfate experimental series the fe3 edds complex and ps decreased from the beginning of the experiments data not shown none of these variables was seriously affected by the nitrate concentration the average ps consumption at the end of the experiments was 73 13 which seems to slightly increase with respect to the sulfate experimental series while fe3 edds complex was almost completely removed from the reaction bulk after 30 min of reaction time in all cases on the one hand this anion did not significantly quench the sulfate and hydroxyl radicals generated but on the other hand the nitrate excitation under uv irradiation which yields various reactive species was neither relevant for process efficiency these results agree with other studies based on uv uv h2o2 and uv ps processes he et al 2014 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 acero et al 2018 where nitrate anions were labelled as non influencer ions because the two possible side reactions with ho and so4 r 6 7 presented very slow reaction rates løgager et al 1993 zhou et al 2018 caf was again the most persistent pollutant followed by ace and carb which was the most rapidly removed mc r6 no3 ho no3 oh r7 no3 so4 no3 so4 2 3 1 3 co3 2 hco3 effects an overall negative impact of carbonate bicarbonate anions on the sulfate based aops has been traditionally assumed bennedsen et al 2012 fig 1 left shows how the removal of the σmcs is affected by tic concentration which was varied between 15 and 150 mg l notice that tic is a lumped measurement of carbonates bicarbonates content the σmcs removal proportionally decreased from 95 to 83 after 5 min of reaction time as carbonates content increased despite this at the end of the experiments 60 min the σmcs attained 99 removal in the assays done with 15 and 50 mg l of tic while the removal for the 100 and 150 mg l of tic assays was 98 and 94 respectively the σmcs removal kinetic constant proportionally decreased as tic increased resulting in 0 58 0 46 0 43 and 0 31 min 1 this efficiency decrease did not affect equally each mc while carb was substantially removed in less than 5 min of reaction time in all cases caf and ace removal efficiency significantly decreased as tic concentration increased especially for ace the undesirable effect of carbonate bicarbonate on mcs removal has been summarized in four possible mechanisms i competition reactions between mcs and carbonate bicarbonate for principal radicals ho and so4 r 8 12 ii formation of carbonate radical co3 which is much less reactive and more selective than ho and so4 r 8 11 iii an excessive increase of ph that impedes the action of so4 and iv absorption or scattering of uv radiation by bicarbonates bennedsen et al 2012 acero et al 2018 lebik elhadi et al 2020 despite all this some electron rich mcs have a strong affinity for carbonate radicals improving their removal indeed acero et al 2018 who studied the uv activated ps process observed how the increasing amount of bicarbonate anion had an inhibitory effect on the removal of some of the contaminants but it also had a positive effect on others therefore depending on the chemical structure of the mcs the carbonate bicarbonate effect will be neutral positive or negative for the degradation rate of mcs which makes it very difficult to predict under actual conditions due to the complex mixtures of mcs always present in mwwtp secondary effluents bennedsen et al 2012 acero et al 2018 lebik elhadi et al 2020 fe3 edds complex fig 1 right decreased from the beginning of the treatment and it was removed 98 from the reaction bulk after 30 min in each case ps average consumption was 65 10 in this way neither fe3 edds complex degradation nor ps consumption were substantially affected by the carbonates bicarbonates concentration r8 co3 2

based aops the reaction between cl and ho yields clho r 13 however this is a reversible reaction that mostly reverts to ho buxton et al 1988 in contrast so4 produces cl through one electron abstraction from cl r 14 which is often reflected in lower efficiencies in the removal of organic pollutants as well as higher generation of reactive chlorine species cl2 clo2 clo and cloh chawla and fessenden 1975 lee et al 2020 chloride concentration in the water matrix was increased from 300 to 1500 mg l resulting in a very similar and fast degradation of the σmcs to an average value of 62 2 in the first 5 min fig 2 left from that moment the σmcs degradation rate slowed down so that 74 2 was the final σmcs removal at 60 min of reaction time although negligible differences for the σmcs degradation profiles were found between the experiments carried out at different concentrations of chloride the mcs removal efficiency significantly decreased with respect to the rest of experimental series shown in previous sections indeed the average kinetic constant for the σmcs removal was 0 062 0 007 min 1 which is about ten times lower than the ones found in the previous experiments fe3 edds concentration profiles did not show any difference with respect to the experimental series also shown in previous sections fig 2 right neither ps consumptions showed significant differences the fe3 edds complex concentration decreased from the beginning of the treatment until 99 disappearing from the reaction bulk after 30 min the average ps consumption for all the assays was 58 11 for a better understanding of these results an individual analysis about the behavior of each pollutant is needed fig 3 ace was the most affected mc by the presence of chlorides while it showed more than 99 removal in 20 min in the absence of chlorides this value was never achieved in any other assay even after 60 min the final removal percentages for ace were 32 26 13 and 19 when 300 700 1100 and 1500 mg l of chloride were added respectively thus ace degradation efficiency diminished as the chloride concentration increased which can be justified by the low reactivity of the pyridine ring of its chemical structure as occurred in the work carried out by vallés et al 2021 when treating a mixture of mcs by photo fenton process conversely the increase of chloride concentration favored caf and carb degradation while 30 and 20 min were needed to achieve 90 degradation at the lowest chloride concentration respectively these times diminished to 15 and 10 min for the highest chloride concentration thus no substantial difference between the σmcs removal profiles was found because the decrease in ace degradation rate was compensated by the improvement of caf and carb removal which demonstrated to be more susceptible to oxidation by chlorine species compared to so4 it is interesting to note that lee et al 2020 reported that this has caused some erroneous claims of the positive effects of chlorides on ps based aops in any case as occurred with carbonates these results show the high complexity of predicting the impact of even a solely anion on mcs removal r13 cl ho cloh r14 cl so4 cl so4 2 3 2 combined effect of anions in different water matrices after studying the individual effects of the most important inorganic anions on the solar fe3 edds ps process their combined effect was then assessed by selecting different water matrices with significantly different physic chemical characteristics thus a new experimental series was carried out with the same pollutants ace caf and carb at the same initial concentrations 200 µg l each but changing the water matrix as follows i sfw ii nw iii 1 2nw iv 1 4nw and v snf concentrate the results corresponding to the decontamination process expressed as the normalized removal profile of the ʃmcs and the normalized average decrease of fe3 edds complex and ps concentrations are presented in fig 4 the water matrices which basically differed in the inorganic content had no significant influence on the fe3 edds complex concentration evolution indeed the fe3 edds complex decrease was always 99 in 30 min and the decontamination process stopped from that moment due to the absence of iron in solution since there were no important differences between fe3 edds profiles neither there were substantial differences between ps consumptions the average ps consumption of the whole experimental series was 57 7 mg l in contrast the water matrix did present a substantial effect on ʃmc removal being always ace the most affected mc followed by caf and finally carb while 80 ʃmc removal was achieved for sfw and snf concentrate after 5 and 10 min of reaction time respectively this value could not be achieved for any of the experiments carried out in nw neither when it was diluted the ʃmc removal levels at the end of the treatment 60 min for nw 1 2nw and 1 4nw were 49 54 and 65 respectively regarding the individual behaviour of the mcs ace was by far the most recalcitrant pollutant followed by caf and carb fig s1 supplementary material since the fe3 edds concentration profiles and ps consumption curves were extremely similar for all the experiments the differences found in the ʃmc removal profiles should be mainly attributed to the side reactions in which the so4 is transformed into less reactive species as occurred when studying the individual effects of the different anions present in the water matrix it can be concluded the low impact of nitrates and sulfates on process performance despite snf concentrate showing the highest concentrations of the whole experimental series for these two components 62 and 1314 mg l respectively the ʃmc removal rate was much higher k 0 19 min 1 than the ones obtained with actual waters k 0 012 min 1 k 0 015 min 1 and k 0 025 min 1 for nw 1 2nw and 1 4nw respectively for which the highest concentrations of these anions corresponding to nw were under detection limit and 162 mg l following the same order disregarding any significant effect of nitrates and sulfates the justification of the obtained results needs to be focused on carbonates and chlorides content according to the results found when assessing the individual effects of anions chlorides presented the most significant impact on process performance however the second fastest ʃmc removal rate in this experimental series was obtained with the snf concentrate water matrix despite presenting the highest chloride concentration this can be only justified by the extremely low concentration of carbonates in the snf concentrate 2 mg l that caused the decrease of the ph during the process from 6 4 to 4 1 the rest of assays presented a stable ph around 7 5 8 somehow this variation of ph allowed substantially neutralizing the negative effect of chlorides on process performance although a common strategy when using aops for mc removal in actual mwwtp effluents is to diminish the tic content of the water matrix to 15 mg l cabrera reina et al 2021 these results suggest that decreasing the carbonates concentration to a minimum content could result in a significant advantage that deserves further attention if the carbonates bicarbonates content is not enough to buffer the ph it will naturally decrease during the process and therefore the negative impact of chlorides will be also minimized the presence of high chloride concentrations has been reported to increase mineralization rates in photo fenton process when carried out at acidic ph zapata et al 2009 according to the mechanism proposed elsewhere le truong et al 2004 in a similar way this could positively contribute to remove mcs in the solar fe3 edds ps process on the other hand the slowest ʃmc removal rate was found for nw which is coherent with its high content of carbonates and chlorides 879 mg l and 258 mg l respectively furthermore the higher the nw dilution the higher the ʃmc removal rate finally the results corresponding to the sfw k 0 31 min 1 assay are also in agreement with the importance of the coupled effect of carbonates and chlorides for the solar fe3 edds ps process the low content of carbonates 13 4 mg l in terms of tic combined with the low content of chlorides 3 7 mg l resulted in the fastest ʃmc removal rate of the whole experimental series 3 3 the effect of dissolved organic matter in addition to the important influence of the inorganic components present in the water matrix it is well known that dom accompanying the mcs also presents a critical impact on aops performance lado ribeiro et al 2019 although irradiation of waters including dom yields the photochemical generation of highly reactive species such as singlet oxygen 1o2 or ho vione et al 2014 the contribution of these radicals to mcs removal in so4 based aops will probably be negligible due to the low concentration of radicals produced from dom in contrast dom is an efficient scavenger of so4 and other radicals that may be generated due to so4 interaction with water matrix and acts as solar radiation filter so that a substantial decrease of aops efficiency can be inferred in the present study further experiments were carried out in the presence of dom specifically i 15 mg l of dom added as a mixture of organic content sources in demineralized water with carbonates 15 mg l expressed as tic ii synthetic mwwtp secondary effluent and iii actual mwwtp secondary effluent despite all three matrices presenting different inorganic and organic content the results did not show any significant difference on the fe3 edds complex removal and ps consumption profiles fig 5 right in each case fe3 edds complex disappeared in more than 99 from the reaction bulk after 30 min and the final ps consumption was 70 16 it was previously demonstrated that the effect of the inorganic components on these variables is negligible therefore the same conclusion can be drawn for dom content in this way the important differences found in ʃmc removal as fig 5 left shows can be mainly attributed to the interaction between water matrix components and the generated so4 radicals plus the increase of turbidity in the case of mwwtp secondary effluents both synthetic and actual as occurred in the previous experimental series ace was always the most affected mc followed by caf and finally carb fig s2 supplementary material although the ʃmcs could be almost completely removed 97 after 60 min of reaction time in the experiment with demineralized water with 15 mg l tic and 15 mg l dom the presence of dom represented a small delay k 0 18 min 1 with respect to the conditions under which the fastest removal rates of the whole work were obtained k 0 6 min 1 in the synthetic mwwtp secondary effluent experiment ʃmc only reached 61 removal at the end of the assay this removal efficiency is 14 lower than the one obtained in the assay from the chlorides experimental series that presented the same carbonate and chloride concentrations but no dom 75 ʃmc removal this is in agreement with the values of kinetics constants 0 062 min 1 in the chlorides experimental series and 0 018 min 1 in the mwwtp secondary effluent experiment thus it can be concluded that there is a negative contribution of dom due to radical scavenging and turbidity increase it is important to note that although the doc concentration of the added dom experiment and the synthetic mwwtp secondary effluent were equivalent the negative effect of dom in the latter was significantly higher in this way not only the dom concentration is critical for process performance but also its composition this is also in accordance with the results obtained in the actual mwwtp secondary effluent assay being its inorganic and organic species concentrations very similar to the ones of the synthetic mwwtp secondary effluent the final ʃmc removal only reached 36 therefore this poor process performance can be only caused by the type and organic composition of actual dom the lowest pseudo first order kinetic constant was found in the actual mwwtp secondary effluent assay concretely 0 007 min 1 unlike the results found for inorganic species when the negative influence was mainly related to the lower ace removal rate all three mcs were equally affected by dom presence 4 conclusions it has been observed that under the conditions studied sulfates nitrates carbonates bicarbonates and chlorides present no significant influence on the fe3 edds concentration evolution nor on ps consumption neither when some of these are present in the water matrix at the same time therefore the effect of water matrix inorganic components on the solar fe3 edds ps process could be mainly defined as the interaction of the components of the matrix with the oxidizing radicals that are generated during the process regarding mc removal nitrate and sulfate have shown no substantial effect on process efficiency while carbonate and chloride high concentrations probed to have a general negative influence although it was dependent on the chemical structure of the mc in this context the joint influence of carbonates and chlorides seemed to be the key variable for mc removal efficiency in addition the results demonstrated that the negative effect of chlorides could be minimized if the carbonate content is low enough for not buffering the ph the mechanism related to this process performance improvement as well as the possible formation of chlorinated intermediates are interesting issues to be studied in the future it was also concluded that the effect of the organic matter strongly depends on both the concentration and composition of the dom this work gave new insights on the solar fe3 edds ps process and its complex reaction mechanism facilitating the understanding of future works when using actual water matrixes and providing valuable information for the development of kinetic models or new operation strategies to optimize process efficiency this information should be cross linked with other studies dealing with intermediate evaluation and toxicity evolution during the process

physicochemical parameters sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 among groundwater karst groundwater widely used worldwide for drinking water supply 20 25 of the global population depends on water from karst aquifers chen et al 2017 has been poorly investigated on the arb dissemination point of view although it is highly vulnerable to urban kaiser et al 2022 and agricultural laroche et al 2010 contaminations indeed due to its heterogeneous structure karst hydrosystem play a crucial role in interconnecting surface and subsurface waters with both slow movement due to infiltration in carbonate matrix and fast transit due to fractures bakalowicz 2005 goldscheider and drew 2007 recent works attest of the importance to consider karst groundwater as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance potentially threatening the human kaiser et al 2022 and environmental zhang et al 2021 health however still little knowledge is produced on the survival dispersal structure of population resistance and virulence of arb within these specific aquifers whereas some characteristics of karsts could be pointed out as affecting the fate of arb we can make two antagonistic hypotheses about the effect of karst on the environmental spread of arb first due to the rapid infiltration from surface water to groundwater bakalowicz 2005 the concentrations and the genetic characteristics of arb in the water may remain unchanged upstream and downstream of a karst aquifer on the opposite the high hardness as well as the low and quite stable temperature of karst groundwater that have been reported to affect the survival of bacterial pathogens such as e coli jang et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 may affect the survival of arb and therefore their concentrations and genetic characteristics to progress on the

approximately 100 km² characterized by a mean annual rainfall of 3 44 mm d 1 during the study period the corresponding mean annual flow rate at the arcier spring was 0 73 m3 s 1 since the roman era the arcier spring has supplied the city of besançon 117 000 inhabitants with drinking water nowadays approximately half of the drinking water of besançon comes from this karst spring two wwtps are

and hydrology of the karst hydrosystem explain in part the observed esbl producing e coli concentrations 4 1 1 origins of esbl producing e coli esbl ec isolates belonging to phylogroups a b2 and d were predominant in the studied watershed isolates belonging to phylogroups a and b2 are predominant in humans escobar páramo et al 2006 isolates belonging to the b2 and d phylogroups are the most virulent and frequently involved in extra intestinal infections escobar páramo et al 2006 tourret and denamur 2016 denamur et al 2021 among the predominant sts a majority is frequently retrieved in blood stream infections i e st10 st58 st69 st73 st95 st131 kallonen et al 2017 royer et al 2021 and associated with extra intestinal pathogenic e coli expec i e st69 st73 st95 st131 denamur et al 2021 esbl ec isolates st73 and st95 had the highest number of vgs but the lowest number of args and arms fig 4 table s1 st73 and st95 strains are the most prevalent expec clonal complexes after st131 strains and are currently the main ones involved in bloodstream infections worldwide denamur et al 2021 the predominant st4981 is very poorly described in the literature st4981 had mainly been reported in antibiotic resistant e coli from agricultural sources gekenidis et al 2018 homeier bachmann et al 2021 mainly swine lee and yeh 2016 hayer et al 2020 the 26 esbl ec st4981 isolates were clonal 10 snps of difference while collected in different sites and different times this high similarity assumes a common origin of these isolates further investigations are needed to identify the common source of st4981 isolates most esbl ec isolates carried a bla ctx m 15 which is mainly associated with humans bevan et al 2017 two esbl ec st10 isolates carried a bla oxa 244 table s1 the bla oxa 244 gene is a single point mutant derivative of bla oxa 48 displaying reduced carbapenemase activity and usually associated with st38 ecdpc 2021 the bla oxa 244 gene has been retrieved in health care facilities and in wastewater ecdpc 2021 but very rarely in the environment abualshaar et al 2022 overall the identified phylogroups sts and bla ctx m suggest that the studied karst hydrosystem was contaminated by esbl ec strains of which the origin appears to be mainly human which is not surprising considering the relative frequent intestinal carriage of these arb in the community broussier et al 2020 bezabih et al 2021 4 1 2 heterogeneous concentrations of esbl producing e coli at the hydrosystem scale esbl ec concentrations were higher in the western part of the watershed than in its eastern part caffeine used as a proxy of anthropisation buerge et al 2003 had higher concentrations in the west i e w st than in the east i e e sh whereas the spring of arcier had intermediate caffein concentrations this confirms that the western part of the watershed is most anthropised than its eastern part the two wwtps present in the watershed are located in the west the two sites with the highest esbl ec concentrations are located downstream of a wwtp i e w sh1 downstream of wwtp 1 and downstream of the most urbanised area of the watershed i e w sh2 the anthropisation and faecal pollution therefore seem to play a major role in the spatiality of esbl ec contamination in the studied karst hydrosystem as already reported karkman et al 2019 henriot et al 2021 esbl ec could be used as a marker of anthropogenic activity in karst hydrosystems furthermore we can assume wastewater network leaks in the underground stream between the w st and w sh2 higher mean and median concentrations of esbl ec in w sh2 i e downstream close to the significant threshold see section 2 1 4 1 3 similar genetic characteristics of esbl producing e coli at the hydrosystem scale no difference in the phylogroups sts number of args and arms and number of vgs was observed in esbl ec isolates from the eastern i e extensive agriculture and western i e anthropised wwtps parts of the watershed moreover esbl ec isolates were not genetically segregated depending on their sampling location populations of esbl ec are homogeneous regardless of the location probably because the vast majority of these isolates had a human origin i e see section 3 1 1 anses 2020 4 1 4 abiotic parameters influencing esbl producing e coli concentrations beta lactams mainly used in humans more than 75 have not been looked for because they are easily hydrolysed and therefore rarely present in the environment among the 10 measured antibiotics esbl ec concentrations were only correlated with the ofloxacin concentrations spearman correlation ρ 0 40 p value 0 013 the role of fluoroquinolone resistance in the spread of esbl ec has previously been demonstrated ben zakour et al 2016 however all measured antibiotic concentrations were lower than typical environmental antibiotic concentrations observed in france haenni et al 2022 and never exceeded the predicted no effect concentrations pnecs bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the mean measured ofloxacin concentration in arcier was 2500 times lower than the pnec mentioned in bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the role of ofloxacin in the selection of esbl ec in the studied karst hydrosystem is therefore very unlikely this suggests that esbl ec are unlikely to be selected and favoured by antibiotic selection pressure in the studied karst hydrosystem esbl ec concentrations positively correlated with the flow rate at the arcier spring as already reported in a karst hydrosystem laroche et al 2010 high flow periods have already been reported to favour the dissemination of faecal bacteria and arb because of the wwtp outflows and the connexion of different ecosystems chu et al 2014 honda et al 2020 henriot et al 2022 most of the sewer systems of the study watershed is separated i e see section 1 1 the contribution of wwtp effluent during high flow periods could therefore be limited the increase in esbl ec concentrations during high flow periods could also be due to the saturation of the karst and deteriorated sewer systems by the deep aquifer and thus the dissemination of associated fecal bacteria including esbl ec moreover we also observed higher esbl ec concentrations in the 3 months low flow period compared to the rest of the studied period low flow periods have already been linked to high faecal bacteria concentrations because of the lower dilution and therefore the higher contribution of wwtp effluents chu et al 2014 overall karst hydrosystems seem to behave like the other hydrosystems low flows and even more high flows seem to favour high concentrations of faecal bacteria among which arb by concentrating them or by favouring their release and dispersal respectively however the correlation between the esbl ec concentrations and the flow rate at the arcier spring was moderate assuming other factors influencing the measured esbl ec concentrations esbl ec concentrations were positively related to the dissolved oxygen and negatively related to the water temperature this could result from the positive relationship between the esbl ec concentrations and the flow rate indeed the higher flow rates occurred during winter and therefore engendered an increase in the dissolved oxygen concentration of the water and a decrease in the water temperature esbl ec concentrations were also positively related to n no3 an ion associated with anthropogenic activities and rapid water transit water transporting higher esbl ec concentrations thus seems to come preferentially from sites influenced by human density during high flow periods as already discussed i e see section 3 1 2 3 1 4 and reported karkman et al 2019 henriot et al 2021 overall the spatio temporality of sampling i e anthropisation and flow rate seems to mainly explain the measured esbl ec concentrations the previous statement is reinforced by the previously discussed positive correlation between the concentrations of esbl ec and the flow rate of the spring of arcier overall the esbl ec concentrations found in the arcier watershed are therefore mainly explained by i the discharges of esbl ec directly depending on the anthropisation and the sources e g wwtps sewer system and ii its transport by surface and groundwater we can therefore assume that karst hydrosystems do not seem to be an ecological niche for esbl ec strains nevertheless the survival of esbl ec isolates in karst allows their efficient dispersal in and downstream the studied karst aquifer 4 2 there is no effect of karst on esbl producing e coli concentrations nor on its genetic characteristics 4 2 1 similar concentrations of esbl producing e coli upstream and downstream of the karst the main goal of this work was to characterize the effect of karst on antibiotic resistance the answer to this question is probably not unique and multifactorial in this study the spring had lower esbl ec concentrations than the watershed s western sinkhole and higher esbl ec concentrations than the watershed s eastern sinkhole whereas no difference was observed when taking both sinkholes together this last result was the same when focusing on the 3 months low flow period overall the karst does not seem to influence the esbl ec concentrations the concentrations of esbl ec downstream of the karst seems to be a mixture of what enters upstream in the karst the potential contribution of esbl ec from diffuse infiltration of precipitation was impossible to quantify esbl ec strains and args have been retrieved in agricultural soils hartmann et al 2012 and could be leached during rainfall events in the karst antibiotic resistant determinants retrieved downstream in the spring could come in part from this unquantified input however given the similarity observed between the sinkholes and the spring the contribution of the diffuse infiltration seems negligible 4 2 2 similar genetic characteristics of esbl producing e coli upstream and downstream of the karst we observed higher esbl ec isolates belonging to the phylogroup a in the spring compared to the sinkholes significantly different but close to the significance threshold we can assume i an enrichment in esbl ec phylogroup a isolates e g due to the presence of esbl ec sources not considered or ii the favouring of esbl ec phylogroup a isolates over the other phylogroups in the karst this last hypothesis is unlikely because the other phylogroups were homogeneous between the sinkholes and the spring the contamination of the deep aquifer by esbl ec strains could not be characterized but this aquifer could be a source of esbl ec isolates belonging to the phylogroup a except for the difference mentioned above no difference in the other phylogroups sts number of args and arms and number of vgs was observed in esbl ec isolates from upstream and downstream of the karst the same results of similarity between upstream and downstream isolates were observed when focusing on the 3 months low flow period results not shown karst groundwater therefore seem to be a dispersal route for esbl ec strains as discussed above i e see section 3 1 4 and suggested by recently published results kaiser et al 2022 hence karst does not appear to favour or disfavour arb the adverse conditions of karst groundwater i e low temperature high hardness do not seem to affect the survival and dissemination of esbl ec strains the low temperatures have been shown to decrease the decay of e coli concentration in water jang et al 2017 which could explain in part this survival nevertheless this is surprising to observe that esbl ec isolates often considered as poorly adapted in environments without any antibiotic selective pressure andersson and hughes 2010 can survive in the environment at least in the studied karst groundwater real life measurements have suggested that arb are not disadvantaged over other markers of faecal pollution karkman et al 2019 therefore the fitness cost of antibiotic resistance could be attenuated or compensated in complex environments as karst groundwater 5 conclusions in summary this one health study provides evidence about the fate of esbl ec strains in a karst hydrosystem and characterized its fluxes and genetic population structure processes highlighted in this study are based on a single and relatively sparsely anthropised watershed and cannot be extended to all karst hydrosystems especially those with high selection pressure i e high antibiotics metals and biocides concentrations and high anthropisation despite this limitation we showed that esbl ec concentrations appear to be predominantly influenced by anthropogenic i e wwtps population density and hydrodynamic i e flow rate parameters and can therefore be good indicators of the functioning of hydrosystems furthermore the studied karst does not appear to have any filtration effect on the esbl ec concentrations or its genetic characteristics our findings demonstrate that esbl ec strains survive in karst hydrosystem and thus easily disperse in and downstream of karst aquifers with the current climate change and the scarcity of water resources it is likely that karst aquifers will be increasingly exploited it is therefore necessary to deepen and extend the findings of this study to heterogeneous karst hydrosystems i e in terms of climate anthropisation hydrology etc finally measures can be taken to minimize the arb inputs in karst hydrosystems such as separating the wastewater and stormwater systems to avoid combined sewer overflows increasing the monitoring of sewer systems to ensure their good condition and limiting the sewage sludge application in karst watersheds

aquifers chen et al 2017 has been poorly investigated on the arb dissemination point of view although it is highly vulnerable to urban kaiser et al 2022 and agricultural laroche et al 2010 contaminations indeed due to its heterogeneous structure karst hydrosystem play a crucial role in interconnecting surface and subsurface waters with both slow movement due to infiltration in carbonate matrix and fast transit due to fractures bakalowicz 2005 goldscheider and drew 2007 recent works attest of the importance to consider karst groundwater as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance potentially threatening the human kaiser et al 2022 and environmental zhang et al 2021 health however still little knowledge is produced on the survival dispersal structure of population resistance and virulence of arb within these specific aquifers whereas some characteristics of karsts could be pointed out as affecting the fate of arb we can make two antagonistic hypotheses about the effect of karst on the environmental spread of arb first due to the rapid infiltration from surface water to groundwater bakalowicz 2005 the concentrations and the genetic characteristics of arb in the water may remain unchanged upstream and downstream of a karst aquifer on the opposite the high hardness as well as the low and quite stable temperature of karst groundwater that have been reported to affect the survival of bacterial pathogens such as e coli jang et al 2017 zeng et al 2019 may affect the survival of arb and therefore their concentrations and genetic characteristics to progress on the

approximately 100 km² characterized by a mean annual rainfall of 3 44 mm d 1 during the study period the corresponding mean annual flow rate at the arcier spring was 0 73 m3 s 1 since the roman era the arcier spring has supplied the city of besançon 117 000 inhabitants with drinking water nowadays approximately half of the drinking water of besançon comes from this karst spring two wwtps are

and hydrology of the karst hydrosystem explain in part the observed esbl producing e coli concentrations 4 1 1 origins of esbl producing e coli esbl ec isolates belonging to phylogroups a b2 and d were predominant in the studied watershed isolates belonging to phylogroups a and b2 are predominant in humans escobar páramo et al 2006 isolates belonging to the b2 and d phylogroups are the most virulent and frequently involved in extra intestinal infections escobar páramo et al 2006 tourret and denamur 2016 denamur et al 2021 among the predominant sts a majority is frequently retrieved in blood stream infections i e st10 st58 st69 st73 st95 st131 kallonen et al 2017 royer et al 2021 and associated with extra intestinal pathogenic e coli expec i e st69 st73 st95 st131 denamur et al 2021 esbl ec isolates st73 and st95 had the highest number of vgs but the lowest number of args and arms fig 4 table s1 st73 and st95 strains are the most prevalent expec clonal complexes after st131 strains and are currently the main ones involved in bloodstream infections worldwide denamur et al 2021 the predominant st4981 is very poorly described in the literature st4981 had mainly been reported in antibiotic resistant e coli from agricultural sources gekenidis et al 2018 homeier bachmann et al 2021 mainly swine lee and yeh 2016 hayer et al 2020 the 26 esbl ec st4981 isolates were clonal 10 snps of difference while collected in different sites and different times this high similarity assumes a common origin of these isolates further investigations are needed to identify the common source of st4981 isolates most esbl ec isolates carried a bla ctx m 15 which is mainly associated with humans bevan et al 2017 two esbl ec st10 isolates carried a bla oxa 244 table s1 the bla oxa 244 gene is a single point mutant derivative of bla oxa 48 displaying reduced carbapenemase activity and usually associated with st38 ecdpc 2021 the bla oxa 244 gene has been retrieved in health care facilities and in wastewater ecdpc 2021 but very rarely in the environment abualshaar et al 2022 overall the identified phylogroups sts and bla ctx m suggest that the studied karst hydrosystem was contaminated by esbl ec strains of which the origin appears to be mainly human which is not surprising considering the relative frequent intestinal carriage of these arb in the community broussier et al 2020 bezabih et al 2021 4 1 2 heterogeneous concentrations of esbl producing e coli at the hydrosystem scale esbl ec concentrations were higher in the western part of the watershed than in its eastern part caffeine used as a proxy of anthropisation buerge et al 2003 had higher concentrations in the west i e w st than in the east i e e sh whereas the spring of arcier had intermediate caffein concentrations this confirms that the western part of the watershed is most anthropised than its eastern part the two wwtps present in the watershed are located in the west the two sites with the highest esbl ec concentrations are located downstream of a wwtp i e w sh1 downstream of wwtp 1 and downstream of the most urbanised area of the watershed i e w sh2 the anthropisation and faecal pollution therefore seem to play a major role in the spatiality of esbl ec contamination in the studied karst hydrosystem as already reported karkman et al 2019 henriot et al 2021 esbl ec could be used as a marker of anthropogenic activity in karst hydrosystems furthermore we can assume wastewater network leaks in the underground stream between the w st and w sh2 higher mean and median concentrations of esbl ec in w sh2 i e downstream close to the significant threshold see section 2 1 4 1 3 similar genetic characteristics of esbl producing e coli at the hydrosystem scale no difference in the phylogroups sts number of args and arms and number of vgs was observed in esbl ec isolates from the eastern i e extensive agriculture and western i e anthropised wwtps parts of the watershed moreover esbl ec isolates were not genetically segregated depending on their sampling location populations of esbl ec are homogeneous regardless of the location probably because the vast majority of these isolates had a human origin i e see section 3 1 1 anses 2020 4 1 4 abiotic parameters influencing esbl producing e coli concentrations beta lactams mainly used in humans more than 75 have not been looked for because they are easily hydrolysed and therefore rarely present in the environment among the 10 measured antibiotics esbl ec concentrations were only correlated with the ofloxacin concentrations spearman correlation ρ 0 40 p value 0 013 the role of fluoroquinolone resistance in the spread of esbl ec has previously been demonstrated ben zakour et al 2016 however all measured antibiotic concentrations were lower than typical environmental antibiotic concentrations observed in france haenni et al 2022 and never exceeded the predicted no effect concentrations pnecs bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the mean measured ofloxacin concentration in arcier was 2500 times lower than the pnec mentioned in bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 the role of ofloxacin in the selection of esbl ec in the studied karst hydrosystem is therefore very unlikely this suggests that esbl ec are unlikely to be selected and favoured by antibiotic selection pressure in the studied karst hydrosystem esbl ec concentrations positively correlated with the flow rate at the arcier spring as already reported in a karst hydrosystem laroche et al 2010 high flow periods have already been reported to favour the dissemination of faecal bacteria and arb because of the wwtp outflows and the connexion of different ecosystems chu et al 2014 honda et al 2020 henriot et al 2022 most of the sewer systems of the study watershed is separated i e see section 1 1 the contribution of wwtp effluent during high flow periods could therefore be limited the increase in esbl ec concentrations during high flow periods could also be due to the saturation of the karst and deteriorated sewer systems by the deep aquifer and thus the dissemination of associated fecal bacteria including esbl ec moreover we also observed higher esbl ec concentrations in the 3 months low flow period compared to the rest of the studied period low flow periods have already been linked to high faecal bacteria concentrations because of the lower dilution and therefore the higher contribution of wwtp effluents chu et al 2014 overall karst hydrosystems seem to behave like the other hydrosystems low flows and even more high flows seem to favour high concentrations of faecal bacteria among which arb by concentrating them or by favouring their release and dispersal respectively however the correlation between the esbl ec concentrations and the flow rate at the arcier spring was moderate assuming other factors influencing the measured esbl ec concentrations esbl ec concentrations were positively related to the dissolved oxygen and negatively related to the water temperature this could result from the positive relationship between the esbl ec concentrations and the flow rate indeed the higher flow rates occurred during winter and therefore engendered an increase in the dissolved oxygen concentration of the water and a decrease in the water temperature esbl ec concentrations were also positively related to n no3 an ion associated with anthropogenic activities and rapid water transit water transporting higher esbl ec concentrations thus seems to come preferentially from sites influenced by human density during high flow periods as already discussed i e see section 3 1 2 3 1 4 and reported karkman et al 2019 henriot et al 2021 overall the spatio temporality of sampling i e anthropisation and flow rate seems to mainly explain the measured esbl ec concentrations the previous statement is reinforced by the previously discussed positive correlation between the concentrations of esbl ec and the flow rate of the spring of arcier overall the esbl ec concentrations found in the arcier watershed are therefore mainly explained by i the discharges of esbl ec directly depending on the anthropisation and the sources e g wwtps sewer system and ii its transport by surface and groundwater we can therefore assume that karst hydrosystems do not seem to be an ecological niche for esbl ec strains nevertheless the survival of esbl ec isolates in karst allows their efficient dispersal in and downstream the studied karst aquifer 4 2 there is no effect of karst on esbl producing e coli concentrations nor on its genetic characteristics 4 2 1 similar concentrations of esbl producing e coli upstream and downstream of the karst the main goal of this work was to characterize the effect of karst on antibiotic resistance the answer to this question is probably not unique and multifactorial in this study the spring had lower esbl ec concentrations than the watershed s western sinkhole and higher esbl ec concentrations than the watershed s eastern sinkhole whereas no difference was observed when taking both sinkholes together this last result was the same when focusing on the 3 months low flow period overall the karst does not seem to influence the esbl ec concentrations the concentrations of esbl ec downstream of the karst seems to be a mixture of what enters upstream in the karst the potential contribution of esbl ec from diffuse infiltration of precipitation was impossible to quantify esbl ec strains and args have been retrieved in agricultural soils hartmann et al 2012 and could be leached during rainfall events in the karst antibiotic resistant determinants retrieved downstream in the spring could come in part from this unquantified input however given the similarity observed between the sinkholes and the spring the contribution of the diffuse infiltration seems negligible 4 2 2 similar genetic characteristics of esbl producing e coli upstream and downstream of the karst we observed higher esbl ec isolates belonging to the phylogroup a in the spring compared to the sinkholes significantly different but close to the significance threshold we can assume i an enrichment in esbl ec phylogroup a isolates e g due to the presence of esbl ec sources not considered or ii the favouring of esbl ec phylogroup a isolates over the other phylogroups in the karst this last hypothesis is unlikely because the other phylogroups were homogeneous between the sinkholes and the spring the contamination of the deep aquifer by esbl ec strains could not be characterized but this aquifer could be a source of esbl ec isolates belonging to the phylogroup a except for the difference mentioned above no difference in the other phylogroups sts number of args and arms and number of vgs was observed in esbl ec isolates from upstream and downstream of the karst the same results of similarity between upstream and downstream isolates were observed when focusing on the 3 months low flow period results not shown karst groundwater therefore seem to be a dispersal route for esbl ec strains as discussed above i e see section 3 1 4 and suggested by recently published results kaiser et al 2022 hence karst does not appear to favour or disfavour arb the adverse conditions of karst groundwater i e low temperature high hardness do not seem to affect the survival and dissemination of esbl ec strains the low temperatures have been shown to decrease the decay of e coli concentration in water jang et al 2017 which could explain in part this survival nevertheless this is surprising to observe that esbl ec isolates often considered as poorly adapted in environments without any antibiotic selective pressure andersson and hughes 2010 can survive in the environment at least in the studied karst groundwater real life measurements have suggested that arb are not disadvantaged over other markers of faecal pollution karkman et al 2019 therefore the fitness cost of antibiotic resistance could be attenuated or compensated in complex environments as karst groundwater 5 conclusions in summary this one health study provides evidence about the fate of esbl ec strains in a karst hydrosystem and characterized its fluxes and genetic population structure processes highlighted in this study are based on a single and relatively sparsely anthropised watershed and cannot be extended to all karst hydrosystems especially those with high selection pressure i e high antibiotics metals and biocides concentrations and high anthropisation despite this limitation we showed that esbl ec concentrations appear to be predominantly influenced by anthropogenic i e wwtps population density and hydrodynamic i e flow rate parameters and can therefore be good indicators of the functioning of hydrosystems furthermore the studied karst does not appear to have any filtration effect on the esbl ec concentrations or its genetic characteristics our findings demonstrate that esbl ec strains survive in karst hydrosystem and thus easily disperse in and downstream of karst aquifers with the current climate change and the scarcity of water resources it is likely that karst aquifers will be increasingly exploited it is therefore necessary to deepen and extend the findings of this study to heterogeneous karst hydrosystems i e in terms of climate anthropisation hydrology etc finally measures can be taken to minimize the arb inputs in karst hydrosystems such as separating the wastewater and stormwater systems to avoid combined sewer overflows increasing the monitoring of sewer systems to ensure their good condition and limiting the sewage sludge application in karst watersheds

15184,the oxidative dissolution of as from arsenopyrite one important arsenic mineral in reducing conditions poses an environmental hazard to natural aquatic systems the dissolution of arsenopyrite occurs slowly due to the surface precipitates of iron oxides in circumneutral oxic environments however the presence of natural ligands and coexisting metals may change the release of fe species which would be of critical importance to the dissolution of arsenopyrite here we investigated the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite induced by pyrophosphate pp and dissolved mn iii species as a natural occurring mn species with strong complexation affinity to pp with the presence of pp the formation of fe ii pp complexes and its rapid oxidation to dissolved fe iii pp species resulted in a substantial increase in the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh under ambient dark conditions contributing to faster dissolution of arsenopyrite and higher percentage of as v in the dissolved products dissolved mn iii though considered as an extra oxidant besides oxygen unexpectedly acted as a radical scavenger for oh and inhibited the production of as v moreover the oxidation of sulfur species differed in the two systems as significant formation of thiosulfate was observed with the presence of pp which did not occur in the system with dissolved mn iii overall the effects of dissolved mn iii and pp on the dissolution of arsenopyrite and the subsequent transformation of fe as and s species have important implications for disentangling the interactions among these metastable elements and for assessing their transport and environmental impacts in aquatic systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved mn iii arsenopyrite arsenite arsenate pyrophosphate ros data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic as a group i carcinogen has threatened the health of millions of people worldwide because of its contamination of groundwater both anthropogenic and natural sources of as are responsible for its high concentration ahmed et al 2004 neumann et al 2010 yu et al 2022 and the dissolution of arsenic sulfide minerals is considered as a pivotal way to release as to the environments smedley and kinniburgh 2002 yin et al 2022 among the more than 300 kinds of as bearing sulfide minerals listed in the online database www mindat org arsenopyrite feass is one of the most abundant and widespread arsenic mineral anthony et al 2001 mandal and suzuki 2002 which occurs widely in mine tailings morales pérez et al 2021 ono et al 2016 the weathering products of feass include sulfuric acid arsenite as iii and arsenate as v which are the essential sources for as pollution of surface runoff and the formation of acid mine drainage amd corkhill and vaughan 2009 paikaray 2015 arsenopyrite also prevails in subsurface environments and turns into a non negligible source of as when encounters with oxic groundwaters due to natural disruptions the fluctuation of seasonal water table levels verplanck et al 2008 or anthropogenic activities such as managed aquifer recharge mar fakhreddine et al 2021 wu et al 2019 therefore investigating the dissolution behaviors of arsenopyrite is of great significance for thorough understanding of the geochemical fate of as and the effective control of its pollution in the above scenarios the dissolution process of arsenopyrite has been extensively studied corkhill and vaughan 2009 generally studies to date have suggested that the dissolution of arsenopyrite is an oxidation process involving the intricate transformation of various metastable intermediate species of fe as and s in varied aqueous geochemistry conditions under acidic oxic conditions fe in the arsenopyrite mineral was preferentially released to the aqueous phase as fe ii but its further oxidation to fe iii by dissolved oxygen was slow jones et al 2015 however due to the widely distributed acidophilic iron oxidizing bacteria in amd environments aqueous fe ii could be oxidized to fe iii which then acted as a strong oxidant to accelerate the dissolution of arsenopyrite corkhill et al 2008 wang et al 2018b zhu et al 2014 such process resulted in as and s rich products in the remaining solid phase asta et al 2010 meanwhile sulfur was oxidized to sulfate through numerous intermediate species including the most common one as the elemental sulfur cornejo garrido et al 2008 mcguire et al 2001 at circumneutral ph under oxic conditions fe ii released from arsenopyrite would be oxidized readily to fe iii by dissolved oxygen which subsequently transformed to ferric oxides and precipitated on the mineral surface inhibiting the subsequent dissolution and release of as in the later period inhibiting further dissolution of arsenopyrite walker et al 2006 yu et al 2007 during alkaline arsenopyrite dissolution arsenite and sulfide recombine in the aqueous phase to form thioarsenic species further complicating the fate of arsenic and sulfur suess and planer friedrich 2012 overall the co existence of various metastable species of fe as and s results in complicated dissolution process of arsenopyrite the minerals water interfacial reactions further control the mineral dissolution dynamics and the subsequent geochemical cycles of metals especially due to the ubiquitous distribution of inorganic or low molecular weight organic acids which can be present in concentration up to 1 mm strathmann et al 2011 and commonly form complex with metals ions and affect the mineral dissolution brantley 2008 furrer and stumm 1986 the oxidative dissolution behavior of arsenopyrite could be significantly altered in the presence of ligands citrate anthropogenic ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta or desferrioxamine b dfob a biogenic iron binding ligand for fe transportation by plants crowley 2000 all considerably promote the dissolution of arsenopyrite in neutral environment by complexing with fe to inhibit the formation of iron oxides precipitates cornejo garrido et al 2008 hong et al 2020 wang et al 2018a photo fenton reactions mediated by fe iii citrate complex under the uv light irradiation generate reactive oxygen species ros further accelerating mineral dissolution and subsequent arsenic oxidation processes hong et al 2020 however in the system with edta no obvious as iii or fe ii oxidation was observed even at circumneutral ph under oxic conditions while dfob acted as the radical scavenger during the oxidative degradation of lipids in cell membranes by arsenopyrite induced radicals cervini silva et al 2013 therefore although natural occurring ligands notably promoted the overall oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite their effects on the dissolution dynamics and transformation of intermediates are not fully understood pyrophosphate pp derived from the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate and a variety of biosynthetic reactions occurred widely in natural environments ikotun et al 2010 trouwborst et al 2006 worsfold et al 2008 and had a strong ability to complex with metal ions including fe ii and fe iii lemire et al 2020 however the role of pp with or without the co presence of metals during the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite is mostly unknown but would be essential in better constraining predictions on as occurrence or the transformation of fe and s intermediate species in the aquatic systems the metastable species dissolved mn iii has gained attention due to its high reactivity in diverse aquatic systems and its ability to donate or accept electrons in redox reactions kostka et al 1995 li et al 2021 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 2014 however little is known about its impact on the release of as from natural occurring minerals and subsequent transformation of as especially in the complex system involving fe species and dissolved oxygen wang et al 2022 ying et al 2020 mn iii could also be strongly complexed by pp which has recently been used as a model ligand for investigating the environmental behavior of dissolved mn iii karolewski et al 2021 qian et al 2019 in the mar operation that used reclaimed wastewater containing high concentrations of nutrient hazardous phosphorus compounds fakhreddine et al 2021 vanderzalm et al 2013 dissolved mn iii pp complex could be formed by the reductive or non reductive dissolution of mn iv mn iii oxides kostka et al 1995 our previous study on the dissolution of realgar and orpiment decoupled the complex dynamics and interactions of mn as and s species in the presence of mn iii pp where sulfide and thioarsenic species were found to be oxidized to arsenate and sulfate by dissolved mn iii under oxic conditions wang et al 2022 however the transformation of arsenic and sulfur in the quaternary system containing redox active elements fe mn as and s and the role of mn and fe during the process remain poorly understood the complicate coupling among redox active elements with multi valence states is a major challenge to unravel their geochemical cycling processes hansel and learman 2015 peiffer et al 2021 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the dissolution behaviors of arsenopyrite in the presence of pp or dissolved mn iii pp 2 explore the transformation of fe as and s species during the dissolution 3 provide direct insights into the complicated geochemical interactions among multiple metastable elements including mn fe as and s in the presence of natural occurring ligand with strong complexation ability in the aquatic environments our present investigation on the effect of pp and dissolved mn iii as mn iii pp complex on the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite by bench scale experiments could provide insights into the interactions between metastable elements as fe s and mn which would help to deepen the understanding of the mobilization of arsenic in natural aquatic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation arsenopyrite samples were procured from inner mongolia mineral samples were milled and sieved to the particle size of 200 mesh and then cleaned prior to further usage the preparation and purity verification of dissolved mn iii stock solution were conducted according to our previous studies qian et al 2019 wang et al 2020 2014 the detailed information of sample preparations and characterizations were provided in si supporting information 2 2 batch experiments and analysis methods the effect of pp and dissolved mn iii on the dissolution of arsenopyrite were evaluated with three sets of batch experiments 1 blank control with only arsenopyrite 2 in the presence of pp and 3 in the presence of mn iii pp all experiments were performed in triplicate and the total volume of each experiment was 100 ml where 0 1 mm 1 mm or 10 mm of pp and 1 mm of arsenopyrite as arsenic were prepared different ratios of the pp to the mineral were set to explore the effect of the ligand on the dissolution of the mineral including the conditions of low ligand concentration and oversaturated ligand concentration the detailed experimental conditions were summarized in table 1 a control group containing only mineral and acetate was conducted to examine the effect of acetate from the mn iii pp stock solution on the dissolution of arsenopyrite aliquots were taken at desired time intervals and filtered 0 22 μm mixed cellulose esters syringe filters to remove precipitates and the supernatants were subjected to wet chemical analysis of sulfide dissolved fe ii dissolved mn iii and total dissolved mn fe and as the concentration of as species was determined by high performance liquid chromatography combining with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icp ms the concentration of sulfate and thiosulfate was analyzed by ion chromatography the concentration of hydroxyl radicals oh was determined by using benzoic acid ba as the probe which could be converted to p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba and was then analyzed by hplc joo et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 at the end of each experiment solutions were filtered and residues were freeze dried to be stored in the dark in an anoxic glovebox prior to analysis x ray powder diffraction xrd raman and scanning electron microscope sem analysis were conducted to obtain the elemental and species information of the solids surface elemental composition and species information were obtained by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps to compare the dissolution of arsenopyrite in different experimental conditions dissolution rates were calculated by liner fitting of the concentration of total dissolved arsenic in the first five days with the slope being acquired as apparent zero order rate constants all rate constants were normalized by the surface area of minerals to a unit of mol m 2 s 1 table 1 the detailed experimental and analysis information were presented in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 the ligand promoted dissolution of arsenopyrite in the arsenopyrite only control experiments the concentration of total dissolved as increased relatively faster in the early stage within 1 day compared to the following slower release process 1 to 5 day fig s1a and 1a the apparent dissolution kinetic of arsenopyrite followed a parabolic rate law fig s1a which is consistent with the transport controlled mineral dissolution behavior steefel 2008 stumm and morgan 1996 previous studies demonstrated that the rate determining step of arsenopyrite dissolution was the electron transfer process between the mineral and the oxidant corkhill and vaughan 2009 the concentration of dissolved fe was at a lower level compared to that of as and decreased obviously after 1 day fig s1b indicating the formation of fe precipitates the newly precipitated solids on the mineral surface may block the access of oxygen to the surface of mineral inhibiting the subsequent dissolution and release of as in the later period more discussed in section 3 4 above results were consistent with previous observations that fe was preferentially released from the crystalline lattice mckibben et al 2008 rapidly oxidized and precipitated as hydrous ferric oxides at circumneutral ph under oxic conditions yu et al 2007 the presence of pp significantly promoted the arsenopyrite dissolution the concentration of dissolved fe showed a congruent increase with that of as during the first 3 days fig 1 a and 2 c at the end of the experiments with 10 mm pp the concentration of as reached 930 μm which were about 6 times higher than that of arsenopyrite only control fig 1a in the presence of 0 1 or 1 mm pp the release of as were promoted to different degrees the apparent linear dissolution kinetics observed for the dissolution of arsenopyrite in the presence of pp indicated that the dissolution process was controlled by a surface reaction the fe released from the arsenopyrite lattice was complexed with pp to form surface complexes which were then detached into the solution resulting in the preferential release of fe and the promotion of arsenopyrite dissolution such process could be described by the classical surface controlled dissolution model stumm and morgan 1996 where the detachment of fe ii pp complexes from the mineral surface was considered as the rate limiting step which was similar to the ligand promoted dissolution of aluminum oxide iron oxide and uranyl oxyhydroxide minerals ferguson et al 2022 furrer and stumm 1986 wang et al 2014 meanwhile the higher ratio of pp to minerals induced higher extent of the detachment of surface fe ii pp complexes increasing the arsenopyrite dissolution rate 1 38 0 17 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 0 1 pp 2 73 0 47 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 1 pp 3 88 0 43 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 10 pp however no liner relationship was observed between the dissolution rate and the ratio of pp to mineral fig 1c which was attributed to that excess ligands saturated the mineral surface and inhibited the release of fe ligand complexes into the solution ferguson et al 2022 kraemer and hering 1997 therefore no significant increase of the dissolution rate of arsenopyrite was observed when excess pp were present in the system 3 2 the effect of pp on the transformation of fe as and s species during arsenopyrite dissolution 3 2 1 aqueous fe species incongruous release of fe and as were observed throughout the arsenopyrite only control experiment figs 1a 2c and s1b the dissolved fe mainly existed as fe ii fig 2a compared to the steady increase of dissolved as that reached 160 μm at the end of the experiment only 30 μm dissolved fe was detected at 1 day and then gradually decreased mainly being attributed to the oxidation of released ferrous iron by dissolved oxygen and the formation of ferric oxides precipitates walker et al 2006 yu et al 2007 compared to the arsenopyrite only control the presence of pp significantly increased the concentration of dissolved fe suggesting the congruent release of dissolved as and fe during the arsenopyrite dissolution fig 1a and 2c although relatively more fe were released in the presence of pp 0 1 1 and 10 mm the concentration of fe ii was lower than that of the control group compared to the condition of 0 1 mm pp less fe ii was accumulated in the presence of higher concentration of pp fig 2a the results indicated that pp not only promoted the detachment of fe from arsenopyrite but also affected the subsequent oxidation of fe ii to fe iii previous studies found that the electron density was pushed towards the fe ii in the fe ii ligand complex which induced its faster oxidation by oxygen than that of free fe ii luther et al 1992 zhou et al 2021 therefore higher concentration of pp induced higher extent of fe ii oxidation resulting in lower detectable fe ii our thermodynamic calculations indicated that all dissolved fe iii species were complexed by pp as the form of fe iii pp feiiip2o7 oh 2 3 table s1 supporting the presence of dissolved fe as fe iii pp complex in the aqueous phase 3 2 2 aqueous as species at the end of the arsenopyrite only control experiment the amounts of as iii and as v accounted for approximately 67 and 33 of the total dissolved as correspondingly figs 3 a c and 4 during the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite as i was oxidized by dissolved oxygen to as iii and as v via a series of one electron transfer steps nesbitt et al 1995 however the oxidation of as iii by dissolved oxygen was relatively slow kim and nriagu 2000 after 5 day dissolution 2 μm oh were detected fig 5 which was considered as an effective oxidant towards as iii hug and leupin 2003 during the dissolution of iron sulfide minerals pyrite and arsenopyrite in the presence of dissolved oxygen hong et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 the formation of oh has been identified due to the oxidation of adsorbed fe ii by oxygen on the mineral surface the oxidation of dissolved fe ii complexes by oxygen or the oxidation of h2o on surface sulfur defects zhang and yuan 2017 the presence of pp not only enhanced the release of as during arsenopyrite dissolution by ligand promoted effect as discussed in section 3 1 but also promoted the oxidation process at the end of the experiments the ratio of as v to total dissolved as were 59 54 and 44 in the presence of 0 1 1 and 10 mm pp respectively which were all higher than that in the arsenopyrite only control 31 fig 4 the presence of pp increased the release of fe from arsenopyrite to the aqueous phase as fe ii pp complexes which were more readily to be oxidized by dissolved oxygen significant accumulation of oh was observed and the final concentration reached 306 μm in the 10 mm pp group fig 5 the promotional effect of citrate on the oh production has been reported during the oxygen induced oxidative dissolution of pyrite and arsenopyrite hong et al 2020 zhang and yuan 2017 such effect was also observed during the soil remediation or contaminants degradation processes when chelating agents were applied to modify the fenton process checa fernandez et al 2021 xie et al 2021 therefore massive formation of oh could be the main reason for the higher extent of oxidation of as iii and higher ratios of as v to total dissolved as than that of the arsenopyrite only control 3 2 3 aqueous s species during arsenopyrite dissolution at circumneutral ph under oxic conditions the oxidation of sulfur occurred with detectable thiosulfate as the intermediate species and the presence of pp remarkably promoted the thiosulfate formation fig 6 c in the arsenopyrite only control the concentration of sulfide s2 in h2s hs and polysulfide was near the detection limit through the experimental course and only a small amount of thiosulfate 4 μm was observed while up to 114 μm of sulfate accumulated at the end of experiments fig 6a c and e the summation of sulfide sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations 118 μm was close to the total dissolved arsenic concentration 159 μm at the end of experiments according to the established mineralogy dependent sulfide oxidation pathway bao et al 2022 the oxidation of sulfur in arsenopyrite was proposed to follow the polysulfide pathway rohwerder et al 2003 steudel 1996 after the broken of fe s bond by oxidants or proton attack sulfur moiety was transformed to more a stable form as elemental sulfur through a series of intermediates including free disulfide h2s2 sulfide cations h2s and polysulfide sn 2 rohwerder et al 2003 elemental sulfur was eventually oxidized to the most stable product as sulfate so4 2 via diverse sulfur oxyanions including thiosulfate s2o3 2 tetrathionate s4o6 2 sulfite so3 2 findlay and kamyshny 2017 in the control experiment without pp comparison between the concentrations of sulfur fig 6a c and e and arsenic species fig 1a indicated that the molar ratio of total sulfur to arsenic species 0 75 1 was close to the ratio 1 1 in the formula of arsenopyrite feass although a minor deviation existed probably due to the underestimated sulfur species from the incomplete oxidation of sulfur intermediates most of the sulfur species was oxidized to sulfate as the final product which was different from previous studies that had elemental sulfur as the principal product in acidic solution that mimic acid mine drainage conditions mcguire et al 2001 zhang et al 2020 given that the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints on the sulfide oxidation by oxygen luther et al 2011 the newly precipitated fe iii oxides under the circumneutral oxic conditions as discussed in section of 3 4 1 were considered to promote the oxidation of sulfide to thiosulfate poulton et al 2004 pyzik and sommer 1981 which was further transformed to sulfate in the presence of oxygen findlay and kamyshny 2017 compared to the control group the presence of pp promoted the formation of thiosulfate the concentration of which showed a steady increase and finally reached 40 166 and 246 μm in the presence of 0 1 1 and 10 mm pp respectively fig 6c the concentration of sulfide was all near the detection limitation after 5 day dissolution fig 6a the concentration of sulfate was not obviously affected by different amounts of pp addition and showed similar level as that of the minerals only control experiment fig 6e while a positive correlation was observed between the concentration of thiosulfate and the amount of pp addition the results indicated that pp only affected the initial oxidation of sulfur to thiosulfate but not on its further oxidation the molar ratio of total sulfur to arsenic species was 0 40 1 0 42 1 and 0 45 1 in the presence of 0 1 1 and 10 mm pp respectively the relatively lower ratio compared to that of mineral only control 0 75 1 indicated that less proportion of sulfur intermediates was oxidized into final sulfate and higher amount of sulfur intermediates existed as speices that could not be quantified given that almost all fe species was in the form of dissolved fe iii section 3 2 1 there would be less oxidation of sulfur species by fe iii oxides above results indicated that the aqueous fe iii pp showed less reactivity towards the oxidation of sulfur species into higher valence products than solid fe iii oxides during the arsenopyrite dissolution 3 3 the effect of dissolved mn iii pp on the arsenopyrite dissolution 3 3 1 the dissolution kinetics the presence of dissolved mn iii pp complexes promoted the dissolution of arsenopyrite while a slower kinetic process was observed when compared to the experiments with the same concentration of pp fig 1 the release rate of as was 2 22 0 15 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 in the presence of 1 mm mn iii with 6 mm pp and was 3 24 0 15 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 for 1 mm mn iii with 10 mm pp fig 1b and table 1 the results suggested that the dissolution rate increased with increasing ratios of pp to mn iii which was consistent with the previously discussed ligand promoted dissolution behavior with increased pp addition section 3 1 intriguingly the dissolution rate in the presence of 1 mm mn iii with 6 mm pp 2 22 0 15 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 was lower than that in 1 mm pp group 2 73 0 15 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 fig 1a 1b and table 1 based on our previous determination that fivefold concentration of pp was required to stabilize mn iii qian et al 2019 1 mm excess of free pp should be present in the 1 mn iii 6 pp system however the presence of excess 1 mm free pp in the mn iii pp system was still less efficient in promoting arsenopyrite dissolution than that in 1 mm pp group the result ruled out the ligand competition effect as the only reason for the slower as release in the mn iii pp system compared to the pp only system 3 3 2 the transformation of fe as and s species although rapid congruous release of fe and as was observed during the arsenopyrite dissolution in the presence of mn iii pp figs 1b and 2d the percentage of as v were remarkably lower than that of the groups with only pp fig 4 after a steady release of fe at the beginning the concentration of total dissolved fe declined after 3 days fig 2d indicating the formation of fe precipitates no accumulation of fe ii was observed whereas fe iii accounted for all the dissolved fe fig 2b in addition to that the presence of pp promoted the oxidation of fe ii section 3 1 dissolved mn iii was able to oxidize fe ii kostka et al 1995 contributing to the low concentration of fe ii consistent with the linear increase of total dissolved as the concentration of as iii and as v also increased steadily fig 3 the ratios of as v to total dissolved as were relatively small and similar 31 throughout the dissolution course 1 mn iii 10 pp and 1 mn iii 6 pp group at the end of the experiments which were significantly lower than that of the pp groups but close to the arsenopyrite only control fig 4 the consumption of ros by mn iii was proposed to be the main reason for the less oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite in the presence of mn iii compared to the pp systems although oh was continuously formed in the 1 mn iii 10 pp group its final concentration only reached 5 of that in the 10 mm pp group fig 5 the results were consistent with previous studies that there was less formation of oh in the presence of mn ii and mn iii which could scavenge oh to form mn iv species gao et al 2022 hussain and ali 1999 on the other side peroxide formed during the oxidation of fe ii by o2 cohn et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 could again reduce mn iv to mn iii and mn ii learman et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 such redox cycle among mn species effectively consumed oh resulting in less oh that would participate in the arsenopyrite dissolution and the oxidation of as iii consequently the proportion of as v in the presence of mn iii pp was smaller than that of the experiments with only pp the concentration of sulfate in the presence of mn iii pp showed the similar change as that of the pp groups and the arsenopyrite only control however the formation of thiosulfate showed different trends fig 6c f the concentration of thiosulfate finally reached 40 and 71 μm in the 1 mn iii 6 pp group and the 1 mn iii 10 pp group respectively which were both remarkedly lower than that in the pp group as the discussions in section 3 2 3 the accumulation of fe iii pp in the presence of pp affected the oxidation of sulfur species and was proposed to be the reason for the massive formation of thiosulfate the relatively lower concentration of dissolved fe iii in the mn iii pp groups fig 2b and 2d accounted for the less formation of thiosulfate thermodynamic calculations showed that the sulfide oxidation by oh was favorable luther et al 2011 luther 2010 which probably contributed to the oxidation of sulfur species however although mn iii consumed most oh the concentration of sulfate was in the similar level as that in the pp group suggesting that oh did not show obvious effect on the oxidation of sulfur intermediates into the final product of sulfate in the mn iii pp groups fig 6c and f 3 4 the transformation of solid products 3 4 1 in the presence of pp during the dissolution of arsenopyrite at neutral ph under the oxic condition ferric oxides precipitated on the mineral surface while the presence of pp effectively inhibited the formation of iron oxides precipitates the sem images and eds mapping of the arsenopyrite only control sample showed the accumulation of iron oxides particles on the mineral surface figs 7 a1 5 xps analysis of fe 2p3 2 confirmed the accumulation of fe iii species on the mineral surface fig 8 a table s2 the as 3d xps spectra showed that the surface arsenic species was mainly in the form of as v which accounted for 86 of total as fig 9 a and table s3 this result was consistent with previous study that the adsorption capacity of iron oxides for as v was higher than that for as iii under at near neutral ph lei et al 2018 there was no obvious signal for s due to its low amount on the surface table s4 above results indicated that the mineral surface was covered by ferric oxides which inhibited the further dissolution of arsenopyrite the presence of pp effectively alleviated the precipitation of iron oxides and therefore arsenopyrite continuously dissolved to produce higher concentration of dissolved as and fe than that of arsenopyrite only control sem eds mapping analysis showed smooth surface of the solids and no obvious presence of iron oxides particles figs 7b1 6 the iron content of the surface of the solid products was lower than that in the blank control table s4 and the percentage of fe ii species exceeded 45 in the presence of 10 mm pp fig 8d and table s2 although in the system with high concentration of pp more mineral dissolution led to a lower signal to noise ratio of xps spectra the fitting results of the species ratio for each element still clearly indicated the percentage of surface as v gradually decreased with the increasing amount of pp fig 9a d and table s3 which was consistent with the decreasing trend of dissolved as v in higher concentration of pp fig 4 on the other hand most iron species existed as dissolved species in the presence of pp fig 2a and c and less fe iii oxides occurred on the mineral surface therefore less amount of as v was adsorbed on the mineral surface in contrast the amount of surface sulfur species increased with increasing pp dosage table s4 and most of them existed as low valence sulfur species that referred to the original mineral fig 9e f and s5 the above changes of the content and species of fe as and s concretely illustrate the ligand promoted effect of pp during the arsenopyrite dissolution although thermodynamic calculations showed that all fe species should be present in the form of dissolved fe iii pp feiiip2o7 oh 2 3 table s1 part of the fe precipitated with phosphate at the later stage in the experiments with 1 and 10 mm pp the hydrolysis of pp fig s2 probably results in the localized supersaturation and the precipitation of fe iii phosphate species on the mineral surface thus decreasing the concentration of dissolved fe in the later stage the accumulation of p on the surface of the solid products was observed by the xps analysis table s4 and sem eds mapping fig 7b6 and table s6 raman analysis showed one species with main peak at about 1000 cm 1 fig s3 which was similar to that of the iron phosphate fepo4 zaghib and julien 2005 3 4 2 in the presence of dissolved mn iii pp after the dissolved mn iii was consumed by oh formed by the dissolution of arsenopyrite section 3 3 2 mn ii precipitated out with phosphate resulting in the loss of aqueous mn species the sem eds mapping showed the accumulation of p o and mn elements on the arsenopyrite residues fig 7 the peak at about 9 5 in the xrd spectra indicated the formation of mn containing phosphate precipitates mn3 po4 2 oh 2 4h2o indexed as pdf 27 0712 fig 10 xps analysis also showed that these three elements were the major constituents on the mineral surface more than 70 table s4 the peak position and profile of mn 2p 3 2 xps spectra fig s4 were identical to that of reported mn phosphate compounds huang et al 2014 our previous study found that mn ii from the reduction of mn iii mainly precipitated with pp when pp was less hydrolyzed wang et al 2014 the hydrolysis of about 13 of the pp in the experiments with 1 mm mn iii and 10 mm pp yielded a high concentration of phosphate up to about 2500 μm fig s2 which then precipitated out with mn ii the absence of as and s signals in the xps spectra indicated that the mineral surface was covered by mn phosphate table s4 which probably inhibited the access of oxidants and ligands to the mineral surface and resulted in slower dissolution of arsenopyrite in the presence of dissolved mn iii 4 conclusions and environmental implications we investigated the effects of pyrophosphate pp and dissolved mn iii pp on the dissolution behavior of arsenopyrite feass at neutral ph under oxic conditions the ligand promoted effect of pp significantly enhanced the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite iron oxides precipitation under neutral conditions was alleviated due to the complexation of fe with pp to maintain as dissolved form the further oxidation of fe ii was also promoted in the presence of pp the above redox cycle of iron species resulted in a substantial increase of the production of oh in the dark which induced faster arsenopyrite dissolution and higher concentration of as v though the presence of mn iii pp also promoted arsenopyrite dissolution the lower production of oh resulted in slower arsenopyrite dissolution rate and lower percentage of as v compared to the experiments with only pp in the neutral atmospheric environments arsenopyrite dissolves slowly due to the release of fe as the rate limiting step and the precipitation of iron oxides in the presence of ligands such as citrate edta and dfob the ligand promoted effect accelerated the dissolution of arsenopyrite and showed diverse effect on the oxidation of dissolved fe and as species cervini silva et al 2013 hong et al 2020 wang et al 2018a the presence of citrate and pp allows the oxidation of fe ii in the fe ii ligand complexes promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species from the fenton reaction accelerating arsenopyrite dissolution and the oxidation of as species meanwhile redox active metals such as mn iii that complexed by these ligands can consume radicals and reduce the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite our investigations on the effects of ligands and metal complexes on the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite provide useful mechanistic understanding towards arsenic release and oxidation especially in natural settings with groundwater disturbance including the managed aquifer recharge mar operation fakhreddine et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the observation of oh during the dissolution of arsenopyrite also helps to deepen the understanding of the effect of low molecular weight organic acids and coexisting metals on the formation of reactive oxygen species in dark conditions caused by the oxidation of fe species in natural aquatic systems different from the previously investigated ternary system involving mn as and s species where mn species constrained the oxidation of as and s wang et al 2022 in the quaternary system involving mn as fe and s species at circumneutral ph the presence of fe redox cycle and fe oxide precipitates complicates the cycling of metastable species solid phase composition and the generation of free radicals etc therefore in the current dissolution of arsenopyrite with the dissolved mn iii pp the dynamics and interfacial interactions among fe mn as s species on the mineral surface are deconstructed which provide useful insights into the complicated coupling of redox active elements

15184,the oxidative dissolution of as from arsenopyrite one important arsenic mineral in reducing conditions poses an environmental hazard to natural aquatic systems the dissolution of arsenopyrite occurs slowly due to the surface precipitates of iron oxides in circumneutral oxic environments however the presence of natural ligands and coexisting metals may change the release of fe species which would be of critical importance to the dissolution of arsenopyrite here we investigated the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite induced by pyrophosphate pp and dissolved mn iii species as a natural occurring mn species with strong complexation affinity to pp with the presence of pp the formation of fe ii pp complexes and its rapid oxidation to dissolved fe iii pp species resulted in a substantial increase in the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh under ambient dark conditions contributing to faster dissolution of arsenopyrite and higher percentage of as v in the dissolved products dissolved mn iii though considered as an extra oxidant besides oxygen unexpectedly acted as a radical scavenger for oh and inhibited the production of as v moreover the oxidation of sulfur species differed in the two systems as significant formation of thiosulfate was observed with the presence of pp which did not occur in the system with dissolved mn iii overall the effects of dissolved mn iii and pp on the dissolution of arsenopyrite and the subsequent transformation of fe as and s species have important implications for disentangling the interactions among these metastable elements and for assessing their transport and environmental impacts in aquatic systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved mn iii arsenopyrite arsenite arsenate pyrophosphate ros data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction arsenic as a group i carcinogen has threatened the health of millions of people worldwide because of its contamination of groundwater both anthropogenic and natural sources of as are responsible for its high concentration ahmed et al 2004 neumann et al 2010 yu et al 2022 and the dissolution of arsenic sulfide minerals is considered as a pivotal way to release as to the environments smedley and kinniburgh 2002 yin et al 2022 among the more than 300 kinds of as bearing sulfide minerals listed in the online database www mindat org arsenopyrite feass is one of the most abundant and widespread arsenic mineral anthony et al 2001 mandal and suzuki 2002 which occurs widely in mine tailings morales pérez et al 2021 ono et al 2016 the weathering products of feass include sulfuric acid arsenite as iii and arsenate as v which are the essential sources for as pollution of surface runoff and the formation of acid mine drainage amd corkhill and vaughan 2009 paikaray 2015 arsenopyrite also prevails in subsurface environments and turns into a non negligible source of as when encounters with oxic groundwaters due to natural disruptions the fluctuation of seasonal water table levels verplanck et al 2008 or anthropogenic activities such as managed aquifer recharge mar fakhreddine et al 2021 wu et al 2019 therefore investigating the dissolution behaviors of arsenopyrite is of great significance for thorough understanding of the geochemical fate of as and the effective control of its pollution in the above scenarios the dissolution process of arsenopyrite has been extensively studied corkhill and vaughan 2009 generally studies to date have suggested that the dissolution of arsenopyrite is an oxidation process involving the intricate transformation of various metastable intermediate species of fe as and s in varied aqueous geochemistry conditions under acidic oxic conditions fe in the arsenopyrite mineral was preferentially released to the aqueous phase as fe ii but its further oxidation to fe iii by dissolved oxygen was slow jones et al 2015 however due to the widely distributed acidophilic iron oxidizing bacteria in amd environments aqueous fe ii could be oxidized to fe iii which then acted as a strong oxidant to accelerate the dissolution of arsenopyrite corkhill et al 2008 wang et al 2018b zhu et al 2014 such process resulted in as and s rich products in the remaining solid phase asta et al 2010 meanwhile sulfur was oxidized to sulfate through numerous intermediate species including the most common one as the elemental sulfur cornejo garrido et al 2008 mcguire et al 2001 at circumneutral ph under oxic conditions fe ii released from arsenopyrite would be oxidized readily to fe iii by dissolved oxygen which subsequently transformed to ferric oxides and precipitated on the mineral surface inhibiting the subsequent dissolution and release of as in the later period inhibiting further dissolution of arsenopyrite walker et al 2006 yu et al 2007 during alkaline arsenopyrite dissolution arsenite and sulfide recombine in the aqueous phase to form thioarsenic species further complicating the fate of arsenic and sulfur suess and planer friedrich 2012 overall the co existence of various metastable species of fe as and s results in complicated dissolution process of arsenopyrite the minerals water interfacial reactions further control the mineral dissolution dynamics and the subsequent geochemical cycles of metals especially due to the ubiquitous distribution of inorganic or low molecular weight organic acids which can be present in concentration up to 1 mm strathmann et al 2011 and commonly form complex with metals ions and affect the mineral dissolution brantley 2008 furrer and stumm 1986 the oxidative dissolution behavior of arsenopyrite could be significantly altered in the presence of ligands citrate anthropogenic ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta or desferrioxamine b dfob a biogenic iron binding ligand for fe transportation by plants crowley 2000 all considerably promote the dissolution of arsenopyrite in neutral environment by complexing with fe to inhibit the formation of iron oxides precipitates cornejo garrido et al 2008 hong et al 2020 wang et al 2018a photo fenton reactions mediated by fe iii citrate complex under the uv light irradiation generate reactive oxygen species ros further accelerating mineral dissolution and subsequent arsenic oxidation processes hong et al 2020 however in the system with edta no obvious as iii or fe ii oxidation was observed even at circumneutral ph under oxic conditions while dfob acted as the radical scavenger during the oxidative degradation of lipids in cell membranes by arsenopyrite induced radicals cervini silva et al 2013 therefore although natural occurring ligands notably promoted the overall oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite their effects on the dissolution dynamics and transformation of intermediates are not fully understood pyrophosphate pp derived from the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate and a variety of biosynthetic reactions occurred widely in natural environments ikotun et al 2010 trouwborst et al 2006 worsfold et al 2008 and had a strong ability to complex with metal ions including fe ii and fe iii lemire et al 2020 however the role of pp with or without the co presence of metals during the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite is mostly unknown but would be essential in better constraining predictions on as occurrence or the transformation of fe and s intermediate species in the aquatic systems the metastable species dissolved mn iii has gained attention due to its high reactivity in diverse aquatic systems and its ability to donate or accept electrons in redox reactions kostka et al 1995 li et al 2021 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 2014 however little is known about its impact on the release of as from natural occurring minerals and subsequent transformation of as especially in the complex system involving fe species and dissolved oxygen wang et al 2022 ying et al 2020 mn iii could also be strongly complexed by pp which has recently been used as a model ligand for investigating the environmental behavior of dissolved mn iii karolewski et al 2021 qian et al 2019 in the mar operation that used reclaimed wastewater containing high concentrations of nutrient hazardous phosphorus compounds fakhreddine et al 2021 vanderzalm et al 2013 dissolved mn iii pp complex could be formed by the reductive or non reductive dissolution of mn iv mn iii oxides kostka et al 1995 our previous study on the dissolution of realgar and orpiment decoupled the complex dynamics and interactions of mn as and s species in the presence of mn iii pp where sulfide and thioarsenic species were found to be oxidized to arsenate and sulfate by dissolved mn iii under oxic conditions wang et al 2022 however the transformation of arsenic and sulfur in the quaternary system containing redox active elements fe mn as and s and the role of mn and fe during the process remain poorly understood the complicate coupling among redox active elements with multi valence states is a major challenge to unravel their geochemical cycling processes hansel and learman 2015 peiffer et al 2021 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the dissolution behaviors of arsenopyrite in the presence of pp or dissolved mn iii pp 2 explore the transformation of fe as and s species during the dissolution 3 provide direct insights into the complicated geochemical interactions among multiple metastable elements including mn fe as and s in the presence of natural occurring ligand with strong complexation ability in the aquatic environments our present investigation on the effect of pp and dissolved mn iii as mn iii pp complex on the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite by bench scale experiments could provide insights into the interactions between metastable elements as fe s and mn which would help to deepen the understanding of the mobilization of arsenic in natural aquatic systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation arsenopyrite samples were procured from inner mongolia mineral samples were milled and sieved to the particle size of 200 mesh and then cleaned prior to further usage the preparation and purity verification of dissolved mn iii stock solution were conducted according to our previous studies qian et al 2019 wang et al 2020 2014 the detailed information of sample preparations and characterizations were provided in si supporting information 2 2 batch experiments and analysis methods the effect of pp and dissolved mn iii on the dissolution of arsenopyrite were evaluated with three sets of batch experiments 1 blank control with only arsenopyrite 2 in the presence of pp and 3 in the presence of mn iii pp all experiments were performed in triplicate and the total volume of each experiment was 100 ml where 0 1 mm 1 mm or 10 mm of pp and 1 mm of arsenopyrite as arsenic were prepared different ratios of the pp to the mineral were set to explore the effect of the ligand on the dissolution of the mineral including the conditions of low ligand concentration and oversaturated ligand concentration the detailed experimental conditions were summarized in table 1 a control group containing only mineral and acetate was conducted to examine the effect of acetate from the mn iii pp stock solution on the dissolution of arsenopyrite aliquots were taken at desired time intervals and filtered 0 22 μm mixed cellulose esters syringe filters to remove precipitates and the supernatants were subjected to wet chemical analysis of sulfide dissolved fe ii dissolved mn iii and total dissolved mn fe and as the concentration of as species was determined by high performance liquid chromatography combining with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icp ms the concentration of sulfate and thiosulfate was analyzed by ion chromatography the concentration of hydroxyl radicals oh was determined by using benzoic acid ba as the probe which could be converted to p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba and was then analyzed by hplc joo et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 at the end of each experiment solutions were filtered and residues were freeze dried to be stored in the dark in an anoxic glovebox prior to analysis x ray powder diffraction xrd raman and scanning electron microscope sem analysis were conducted to obtain the elemental and species information of the solids surface elemental composition and species information were obtained by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps to compare the dissolution of arsenopyrite in different experimental conditions dissolution rates were calculated by liner fitting of the concentration of total dissolved arsenic in the first five days with the slope being acquired as apparent zero order rate constants all rate constants were normalized by the surface area of minerals to a unit of mol m 2 s 1 table 1 the detailed experimental and analysis information were presented in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 the ligand promoted dissolution of arsenopyrite in the arsenopyrite only control experiments the concentration of total dissolved as increased relatively faster in the early stage within 1 day compared to the following slower release process 1 to 5 day fig s1a and 1a the apparent dissolution kinetic of arsenopyrite followed a parabolic rate law fig s1a which is consistent with the transport controlled mineral dissolution behavior steefel 2008 stumm and morgan 1996 previous studies demonstrated that the rate determining step of arsenopyrite dissolution was the electron transfer process between the mineral and the oxidant corkhill and vaughan 2009 the concentration of dissolved fe was at a lower level compared to that of as and decreased obviously after 1 day fig s1b indicating the formation of fe precipitates the newly precipitated solids on the mineral surface may block the access of oxygen to the surface of mineral inhibiting the subsequent dissolution and release of as in the later period more discussed in section 3 4 above results were consistent with previous observations that fe was preferentially released from the crystalline lattice mckibben et al 2008 rapidly oxidized and precipitated as hydrous ferric oxides at circumneutral ph under oxic conditions yu et al 2007 the presence of pp significantly promoted the arsenopyrite dissolution the concentration of dissolved fe showed a congruent increase with that of as during the first 3 days fig 1 a and 2 c at the end of the experiments with 10 mm pp the concentration of as reached 930 μm which were about 6 times higher than that of arsenopyrite only control fig 1a in the presence of 0 1 or 1 mm pp the release of as were promoted to different degrees the apparent linear dissolution kinetics observed for the dissolution of arsenopyrite in the presence of pp indicated that the dissolution process was controlled by a surface reaction the fe released from the arsenopyrite lattice was complexed with pp to form surface complexes which were then detached into the solution resulting in the preferential release of fe and the promotion of arsenopyrite dissolution such process could be described by the classical surface controlled dissolution model stumm and morgan 1996 where the detachment of fe ii pp complexes from the mineral surface was considered as the rate limiting step which was similar to the ligand promoted dissolution of aluminum oxide iron oxide and uranyl oxyhydroxide minerals ferguson et al 2022 furrer and stumm 1986 wang et al 2014 meanwhile the higher ratio of pp to minerals induced higher extent of the detachment of surface fe ii pp complexes increasing the arsenopyrite dissolution rate 1 38 0 17 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 0 1 pp 2 73 0 47 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 1 pp 3 88 0 43 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 10 pp however no liner relationship was observed between the dissolution rate and the ratio of pp to mineral fig 1c which was attributed to that excess ligands saturated the mineral surface and inhibited the release of fe ligand complexes into the solution ferguson et al 2022 kraemer and hering 1997 therefore no significant increase of the dissolution rate of arsenopyrite was observed when excess pp were present in the system 3 2 the effect of pp on the transformation of fe as and s species during arsenopyrite dissolution 3 2 1 aqueous fe species incongruous release of fe and as were observed throughout the arsenopyrite only control experiment figs 1a 2c and s1b the dissolved fe mainly existed as fe ii fig 2a compared to the steady increase of dissolved as that reached 160 μm at the end of the experiment only 30 μm dissolved fe was detected at 1 day and then gradually decreased mainly being attributed to the oxidation of released ferrous iron by dissolved oxygen and the formation of ferric oxides precipitates walker et al 2006 yu et al 2007 compared to the arsenopyrite only control the presence of pp significantly increased the concentration of dissolved fe suggesting the congruent release of dissolved as and fe during the arsenopyrite dissolution fig 1a and 2c although relatively more fe were released in the presence of pp 0 1 1 and 10 mm the concentration of fe ii was lower than that of the control group compared to the condition of 0 1 mm pp less fe ii was accumulated in the presence of higher concentration of pp fig 2a the results indicated that pp not only promoted the detachment of fe from arsenopyrite but also affected the subsequent oxidation of fe ii to fe iii previous studies found that the electron density was pushed towards the fe ii in the fe ii ligand complex which induced its faster oxidation by oxygen than that of free fe ii luther et al 1992 zhou et al 2021 therefore higher concentration of pp induced higher extent of fe ii oxidation resulting in lower detectable fe ii our thermodynamic calculations indicated that all dissolved fe iii species were complexed by pp as the form of fe iii pp feiiip2o7 oh 2 3 table s1 supporting the presence of dissolved fe as fe iii pp complex in the aqueous phase 3 2 2 aqueous as species at the end of the arsenopyrite only control experiment the amounts of as iii and as v accounted for approximately 67 and 33 of the total dissolved as correspondingly figs 3 a c and 4 during the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite as i was oxidized by dissolved oxygen to as iii and as v via a series of one electron transfer steps nesbitt et al 1995 however the oxidation of as iii by dissolved oxygen was relatively slow kim and nriagu 2000 after 5 day dissolution 2 μm oh were detected fig 5 which was considered as an effective oxidant towards as iii hug and leupin 2003 during the dissolution of iron sulfide minerals pyrite and arsenopyrite in the presence of dissolved oxygen hong et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 the formation of oh has been identified due to the oxidation of adsorbed fe ii by oxygen on the mineral surface the oxidation of dissolved fe ii complexes by oxygen or the oxidation of h2o on surface sulfur defects zhang and yuan 2017 the presence of pp not only enhanced the release of as during arsenopyrite dissolution by ligand promoted effect as discussed in section 3 1 but also promoted the oxidation process at the end of the experiments the ratio of as v to total dissolved as were 59 54 and 44 in the presence of 0 1 1 and 10 mm pp respectively which were all higher than that in the arsenopyrite only control 31 fig 4 the presence of pp increased the release of fe from arsenopyrite to the aqueous phase as fe ii pp complexes which were more readily to be oxidized by dissolved oxygen significant accumulation of oh was observed and the final concentration reached 306 μm in the 10 mm pp group fig 5 the promotional effect of citrate on the oh production has been reported during the oxygen induced oxidative dissolution of pyrite and arsenopyrite hong et al 2020 zhang and yuan 2017 such effect was also observed during the soil remediation or contaminants degradation processes when chelating agents were applied to modify the fenton process checa fernandez et al 2021 xie et al 2021 therefore massive formation of oh could be the main reason for the higher extent of oxidation of as iii and higher ratios of as v to total dissolved as than that of the arsenopyrite only control 3 2 3 aqueous s species during arsenopyrite dissolution at circumneutral ph under oxic conditions the oxidation of sulfur occurred with detectable thiosulfate as the intermediate species and the presence of pp remarkably promoted the thiosulfate formation fig 6 c in the arsenopyrite only control the concentration of sulfide s2 in h2s hs and polysulfide was near the detection limit through the experimental course and only a small amount of thiosulfate 4 μm was observed while up to 114 μm of sulfate accumulated at the end of experiments fig 6a c and e the summation of sulfide sulfate and thiosulfate concentrations 118 μm was close to the total dissolved arsenic concentration 159 μm at the end of experiments according to the established mineralogy dependent sulfide oxidation pathway bao et al 2022 the oxidation of sulfur in arsenopyrite was proposed to follow the polysulfide pathway rohwerder et al 2003 steudel 1996 after the broken of fe s bond by oxidants or proton attack sulfur moiety was transformed to more a stable form as elemental sulfur through a series of intermediates including free disulfide h2s2 sulfide cations h2s and polysulfide sn 2 rohwerder et al 2003 elemental sulfur was eventually oxidized to the most stable product as sulfate so4 2 via diverse sulfur oxyanions including thiosulfate s2o3 2 tetrathionate s4o6 2 sulfite so3 2 findlay and kamyshny 2017 in the control experiment without pp comparison between the concentrations of sulfur fig 6a c and e and arsenic species fig 1a indicated that the molar ratio of total sulfur to arsenic species 0 75 1 was close to the ratio 1 1 in the formula of arsenopyrite feass although a minor deviation existed probably due to the underestimated sulfur species from the incomplete oxidation of sulfur intermediates most of the sulfur species was oxidized to sulfate as the final product which was different from previous studies that had elemental sulfur as the principal product in acidic solution that mimic acid mine drainage conditions mcguire et al 2001 zhang et al 2020 given that the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints on the sulfide oxidation by oxygen luther et al 2011 the newly precipitated fe iii oxides under the circumneutral oxic conditions as discussed in section of 3 4 1 were considered to promote the oxidation of sulfide to thiosulfate poulton et al 2004 pyzik and sommer 1981 which was further transformed to sulfate in the presence of oxygen findlay and kamyshny 2017 compared to the control group the presence of pp promoted the formation of thiosulfate the concentration of which showed a steady increase and finally reached 40 166 and 246 μm in the presence of 0 1 1 and 10 mm pp respectively fig 6c the concentration of sulfide was all near the detection limitation after 5 day dissolution fig 6a the concentration of sulfate was not obviously affected by different amounts of pp addition and showed similar level as that of the minerals only control experiment fig 6e while a positive correlation was observed between the concentration of thiosulfate and the amount of pp addition the results indicated that pp only affected the initial oxidation of sulfur to thiosulfate but not on its further oxidation the molar ratio of total sulfur to arsenic species was 0 40 1 0 42 1 and 0 45 1 in the presence of 0 1 1 and 10 mm pp respectively the relatively lower ratio compared to that of mineral only control 0 75 1 indicated that less proportion of sulfur intermediates was oxidized into final sulfate and higher amount of sulfur intermediates existed as speices that could not be quantified given that almost all fe species was in the form of dissolved fe iii section 3 2 1 there would be less oxidation of sulfur species by fe iii oxides above results indicated that the aqueous fe iii pp showed less reactivity towards the oxidation of sulfur species into higher valence products than solid fe iii oxides during the arsenopyrite dissolution 3 3 the effect of dissolved mn iii pp on the arsenopyrite dissolution 3 3 1 the dissolution kinetics the presence of dissolved mn iii pp complexes promoted the dissolution of arsenopyrite while a slower kinetic process was observed when compared to the experiments with the same concentration of pp fig 1 the release rate of as was 2 22 0 15 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 in the presence of 1 mm mn iii with 6 mm pp and was 3 24 0 15 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 for 1 mm mn iii with 10 mm pp fig 1b and table 1 the results suggested that the dissolution rate increased with increasing ratios of pp to mn iii which was consistent with the previously discussed ligand promoted dissolution behavior with increased pp addition section 3 1 intriguingly the dissolution rate in the presence of 1 mm mn iii with 6 mm pp 2 22 0 15 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 was lower than that in 1 mm pp group 2 73 0 15 10 10 mol m 2 s 1 fig 1a 1b and table 1 based on our previous determination that fivefold concentration of pp was required to stabilize mn iii qian et al 2019 1 mm excess of free pp should be present in the 1 mn iii 6 pp system however the presence of excess 1 mm free pp in the mn iii pp system was still less efficient in promoting arsenopyrite dissolution than that in 1 mm pp group the result ruled out the ligand competition effect as the only reason for the slower as release in the mn iii pp system compared to the pp only system 3 3 2 the transformation of fe as and s species although rapid congruous release of fe and as was observed during the arsenopyrite dissolution in the presence of mn iii pp figs 1b and 2d the percentage of as v were remarkably lower than that of the groups with only pp fig 4 after a steady release of fe at the beginning the concentration of total dissolved fe declined after 3 days fig 2d indicating the formation of fe precipitates no accumulation of fe ii was observed whereas fe iii accounted for all the dissolved fe fig 2b in addition to that the presence of pp promoted the oxidation of fe ii section 3 1 dissolved mn iii was able to oxidize fe ii kostka et al 1995 contributing to the low concentration of fe ii consistent with the linear increase of total dissolved as the concentration of as iii and as v also increased steadily fig 3 the ratios of as v to total dissolved as were relatively small and similar 31 throughout the dissolution course 1 mn iii 10 pp and 1 mn iii 6 pp group at the end of the experiments which were significantly lower than that of the pp groups but close to the arsenopyrite only control fig 4 the consumption of ros by mn iii was proposed to be the main reason for the less oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite in the presence of mn iii compared to the pp systems although oh was continuously formed in the 1 mn iii 10 pp group its final concentration only reached 5 of that in the 10 mm pp group fig 5 the results were consistent with previous studies that there was less formation of oh in the presence of mn ii and mn iii which could scavenge oh to form mn iv species gao et al 2022 hussain and ali 1999 on the other side peroxide formed during the oxidation of fe ii by o2 cohn et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 could again reduce mn iv to mn iii and mn ii learman et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 such redox cycle among mn species effectively consumed oh resulting in less oh that would participate in the arsenopyrite dissolution and the oxidation of as iii consequently the proportion of as v in the presence of mn iii pp was smaller than that of the experiments with only pp the concentration of sulfate in the presence of mn iii pp showed the similar change as that of the pp groups and the arsenopyrite only control however the formation of thiosulfate showed different trends fig 6c f the concentration of thiosulfate finally reached 40 and 71 μm in the 1 mn iii 6 pp group and the 1 mn iii 10 pp group respectively which were both remarkedly lower than that in the pp group as the discussions in section 3 2 3 the accumulation of fe iii pp in the presence of pp affected the oxidation of sulfur species and was proposed to be the reason for the massive formation of thiosulfate the relatively lower concentration of dissolved fe iii in the mn iii pp groups fig 2b and 2d accounted for the less formation of thiosulfate thermodynamic calculations showed that the sulfide oxidation by oh was favorable luther et al 2011 luther 2010 which probably contributed to the oxidation of sulfur species however although mn iii consumed most oh the concentration of sulfate was in the similar level as that in the pp group suggesting that oh did not show obvious effect on the oxidation of sulfur intermediates into the final product of sulfate in the mn iii pp groups fig 6c and f 3 4 the transformation of solid products 3 4 1 in the presence of pp during the dissolution of arsenopyrite at neutral ph under the oxic condition ferric oxides precipitated on the mineral surface while the presence of pp effectively inhibited the formation of iron oxides precipitates the sem images and eds mapping of the arsenopyrite only control sample showed the accumulation of iron oxides particles on the mineral surface figs 7 a1 5 xps analysis of fe 2p3 2 confirmed the accumulation of fe iii species on the mineral surface fig 8 a table s2 the as 3d xps spectra showed that the surface arsenic species was mainly in the form of as v which accounted for 86 of total as fig 9 a and table s3 this result was consistent with previous study that the adsorption capacity of iron oxides for as v was higher than that for as iii under at near neutral ph lei et al 2018 there was no obvious signal for s due to its low amount on the surface table s4 above results indicated that the mineral surface was covered by ferric oxides which inhibited the further dissolution of arsenopyrite the presence of pp effectively alleviated the precipitation of iron oxides and therefore arsenopyrite continuously dissolved to produce higher concentration of dissolved as and fe than that of arsenopyrite only control sem eds mapping analysis showed smooth surface of the solids and no obvious presence of iron oxides particles figs 7b1 6 the iron content of the surface of the solid products was lower than that in the blank control table s4 and the percentage of fe ii species exceeded 45 in the presence of 10 mm pp fig 8d and table s2 although in the system with high concentration of pp more mineral dissolution led to a lower signal to noise ratio of xps spectra the fitting results of the species ratio for each element still clearly indicated the percentage of surface as v gradually decreased with the increasing amount of pp fig 9a d and table s3 which was consistent with the decreasing trend of dissolved as v in higher concentration of pp fig 4 on the other hand most iron species existed as dissolved species in the presence of pp fig 2a and c and less fe iii oxides occurred on the mineral surface therefore less amount of as v was adsorbed on the mineral surface in contrast the amount of surface sulfur species increased with increasing pp dosage table s4 and most of them existed as low valence sulfur species that referred to the original mineral fig 9e f and s5 the above changes of the content and species of fe as and s concretely illustrate the ligand promoted effect of pp during the arsenopyrite dissolution although thermodynamic calculations showed that all fe species should be present in the form of dissolved fe iii pp feiiip2o7 oh 2 3 table s1 part of the fe precipitated with phosphate at the later stage in the experiments with 1 and 10 mm pp the hydrolysis of pp fig s2 probably results in the localized supersaturation and the precipitation of fe iii phosphate species on the mineral surface thus decreasing the concentration of dissolved fe in the later stage the accumulation of p on the surface of the solid products was observed by the xps analysis table s4 and sem eds mapping fig 7b6 and table s6 raman analysis showed one species with main peak at about 1000 cm 1 fig s3 which was similar to that of the iron phosphate fepo4 zaghib and julien 2005 3 4 2 in the presence of dissolved mn iii pp after the dissolved mn iii was consumed by oh formed by the dissolution of arsenopyrite section 3 3 2 mn ii precipitated out with phosphate resulting in the loss of aqueous mn species the sem eds mapping showed the accumulation of p o and mn elements on the arsenopyrite residues fig 7 the peak at about 9 5 in the xrd spectra indicated the formation of mn containing phosphate precipitates mn3 po4 2 oh 2 4h2o indexed as pdf 27 0712 fig 10 xps analysis also showed that these three elements were the major constituents on the mineral surface more than 70 table s4 the peak position and profile of mn 2p 3 2 xps spectra fig s4 were identical to that of reported mn phosphate compounds huang et al 2014 our previous study found that mn ii from the reduction of mn iii mainly precipitated with pp when pp was less hydrolyzed wang et al 2014 the hydrolysis of about 13 of the pp in the experiments with 1 mm mn iii and 10 mm pp yielded a high concentration of phosphate up to about 2500 μm fig s2 which then precipitated out with mn ii the absence of as and s signals in the xps spectra indicated that the mineral surface was covered by mn phosphate table s4 which probably inhibited the access of oxidants and ligands to the mineral surface and resulted in slower dissolution of arsenopyrite in the presence of dissolved mn iii 4 conclusions and environmental implications we investigated the effects of pyrophosphate pp and dissolved mn iii pp on the dissolution behavior of arsenopyrite feass at neutral ph under oxic conditions the ligand promoted effect of pp significantly enhanced the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite iron oxides precipitation under neutral conditions was alleviated due to the complexation of fe with pp to maintain as dissolved form the further oxidation of fe ii was also promoted in the presence of pp the above redox cycle of iron species resulted in a substantial increase of the production of oh in the dark which induced faster arsenopyrite dissolution and higher concentration of as v though the presence of mn iii pp also promoted arsenopyrite dissolution the lower production of oh resulted in slower arsenopyrite dissolution rate and lower percentage of as v compared to the experiments with only pp in the neutral atmospheric environments arsenopyrite dissolves slowly due to the release of fe as the rate limiting step and the precipitation of iron oxides in the presence of ligands such as citrate edta and dfob the ligand promoted effect accelerated the dissolution of arsenopyrite and showed diverse effect on the oxidation of dissolved fe and as species cervini silva et al 2013 hong et al 2020 wang et al 2018a the presence of citrate and pp allows the oxidation of fe ii in the fe ii ligand complexes promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species from the fenton reaction accelerating arsenopyrite dissolution and the oxidation of as species meanwhile redox active metals such as mn iii that complexed by these ligands can consume radicals and reduce the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite our investigations on the effects of ligands and metal complexes on the oxidative dissolution of arsenopyrite provide useful mechanistic understanding towards arsenic release and oxidation especially in natural settings with groundwater disturbance including the managed aquifer recharge mar operation fakhreddine et al 2021 wu et al 2019 the observation of oh during the dissolution of arsenopyrite also helps to deepen the understanding of the effect of low molecular weight organic acids and coexisting metals on the formation of reactive oxygen species in dark conditions caused by the oxidation of fe species in natural aquatic systems different from the previously investigated ternary system involving mn as and s species where mn species constrained the oxidation of as and s wang et al 2022 in the quaternary system involving mn as fe and s species at circumneutral ph the presence of fe redox cycle and fe oxide precipitates complicates the cycling of metastable species solid phase composition and the generation of free radicals etc therefore in the current dissolution of arsenopyrite with the dissolved mn iii pp the dynamics and interfacial interactions among fe mn as s species on the mineral surface are deconstructed which provide useful insights into the complicated coupling of redox active elements
