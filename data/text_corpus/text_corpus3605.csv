18025,urban pluvial flood models need to be calibrated with data from actual flood events in order to validate and improve model performance due to the lack of conventional sensor solutions alternative sources of data such as citizen science social media and surveillance cameras have been proposed in literature some of the methods proposed boast high scalability but without an on site survey they can only provide proxy measurements for physical flooding variables such as water level in this study the potential value of such proxy measurements was evaluated by calibrating an urban pluvial flood model with data from experimental flood events conducted in a 25 25 m facility monitored with surveillance cameras and conventional sensors in parallel both ideal proxy data and actual image based proxy measurements with noise were tested and the effects of measurement location and measurement noise were investigated separately the results with error free proxy data confirm the theoretic potential of such measurements as in half of the calibration configurations tested ideal proxy data increases model performance by at least 70 compared to sensor data however image based proxy data can contain complex correlated errors which have a complex and predominantly negative effect on performance keywords urban pluvial flooding proxy measurements flood monitoring model calibration measurement error sensor placement 1 introduction 1 1 the need for flood monitoring data urban pluvial floods also known as nuisance floods or flash floods occur when a city s drainage system does not have the capacity to drain local rainfall during storms as climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall events field et al 2012 it is expected that the frequency and intensity of urban pluvial floods will also increase such flooding is further aggravated by the reduction of pervious surfaces due to urbanization skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 according to certain studies the societal cost of urban pluvial flooding is comparable to that of coastal or river flooding because these tend to occur less frequently jiang et al 2018 ten veldhuis 2011 the issue of urban pluvial floods is of growing importance and demands adequate planning and mitigation tools to assess the risk of urban pluvial flooding and design prevention solutions urban drainage experts use numerical models tools to simulate the flow and accumulation of water in urban catchments these models can be of varying complexity depending mainly on how surface flow is represented the completeness of the flow equations solved if any and the complexity of sewer surface interactions if any overviews of the different numerical models used for urban flood modelling can be found in literature ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 zoppou 2001 regardless of the model used there are often parameters with poorly defined values which can introduce uncertainty in the modelling results but despite the recognized necessity of calibration to reduce these uncertainties calibration of urban drainage models is rarely performed in practice tscheikner gratl et al 2016 the probable cause for this is a lack of monitoring data thorndahl et al 2008 a problem that is aggravated when it comes to measuring surface flooding conventional sensors designed for sewer pipes or well defined channels are not suited to the open urban environment with its complex geometries moving objects and risk of vandalism 1 2 proxy water level measurements from images the difficulty in monitoring urban pluvial floods with conventional sensors has encouraged researchers to explore alternative sources of flooding data such as social media assumpção et al 2018 chaudhary et al 2019 hénonin et al 2015 wang et al 2018 or surveillance cameras bhola et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 leitão et al 2018 lv et al 2018 moy de vitry et al 2019a of the different methods proposed that of moy de vitry et al 2019a stands out because the measurements obtained do not correspond directly to a physical flooding variable but instead contain information on how the water level changes over time the method exploits the assumption that the amount of visible water in the images of a static surveillance camera is associated with the actual flooding water level concretely the method uses a deep convolutional neural network dcnn to periodically segment water in images from a static surveillance camera the area covered by water in each image is expressed as a fraction of the whole image and called the static observer flood index sofi when the method was proposed it was tested on a range of different surveillance video qualities and contexts outdoors and indoors during night and day etc the initial results showed that sofi data had an average correlation of 75 with the actual water level although the variability between videos was high minimum of around 35 maximum around 90 this correlation though imperfect established sofi as a proxy measurement for flood water level the original publication describes the method and results in detail and lists measures by which the quality of the sofi measurements can be improved although the information type provided by sofi is non standard the method has a potential advantage in scalability that justifies further study in principle the assumption sofi relies on association of water level with visible water is so general that sofi can be applied to any static surveillance camera footage without the need for any on site measurements thus sofi is well suited to very large networks of surveillance cameras especially those for which privacy is an issue and human access to the footage is restricted 1 3 hydraulic and hydrologic model calibration with proxy measurements a measurement can be considered a proxy for a physical variable if it has a correlation with that variable in urban pluvial flood modelling proxy measurements could be obtained via surveillance cameras as described in section 1 2 or from conventional sensors that were not correctly calibrated proxy measurements differ from conventional sensor data in that they contain information not in the absolute values of the data but in the shape of the data series as proxy measurements cannot be directly compared with the values of a model simulation metrics like the nash sutcliffe efficiency which is commonly used for model calibration cannot be used despite this challenge the lack of suitable sensing techniques motivates the investigation of how proxy measurements could help calibrate urban pluvial flood models while there are no known examples from urban flood modelling model calibration with proxy measurements has been performed in stream hydrology where van meerveld et al 2017 investigated the value of stream level classes reported by citizen scientists the authors successfully used the spearman rank correlation coefficient spearman 1904 as an objective function for calibration to maximize correlation between observed stream level classes and the linked but not equivalent stream discharge represented as a state variable the spearman rank correlation has also been used in another study jian et al 2017 to calibrate a hydrologic model with water level data without a rating curve which is an equivalent problem 1 4 objective of the current study the objective of this study is to assess the value of proxy measurements as compared to data from conventional sensors when calibrating an urban pluvial flood model the motivation to investigate proxy measurements from alternative data sources is the need for monitoring data for numeric model calibration and the lack of conventional sensor solutions in particular the study uses the sofi method moy de vitry et al 2019a as a possible source of proxy measurements using a large lab like setup the study first investigated the potential value of ideal noise free proxy data under different measurement configurations second the study investigated the impact that noise in proxy measurements have on model performance after calibration noise with a complex correlated structure and with a gaussian distribution were considered separately due to the restricted dimensions of the setup and the experimental nature of the flooding events simulated the aim of this study was primarily of exploratory nature to assess the novel concept of urban pluvial flood model calibration with proxy water level measurements 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental urban catchment for flood events the data used in this study was collected in a 25 25 m lab like facility the facility is a simplified urban catchment with a drainage network and a small building with a basement that can be flooded fig 1 designed for training civil protection forces for flood events the facility was temporarily outfitted with sensors and cameras to collect unique datasets that were documented and shared in previous work moy de vitry et al 2017 the datasets provide both conventional monitoring data and surveillance video documentation for multiple flash flood events despite the facility s limited size it was possible to reproduce different phenomena common to urban pluvial flooding such as shallow overland flow manhole overflow ponding and basement flooding however rainfall runoff processes could not be reproduced in the catchment from the original experiments four sensors and one camera were selected for inclusion in this study a magnetic inductive flow meter provides data about the flow of water into the system and three ultrasonic water level sensors provide flood level data at three separate locations of the catchment the ultrasonic sensors and camera provide the calibration data for this study as described in sections 2 2 2 3 and 2 6 each flood event consisted in manually regulating a valve to let water from a reservoir into the facility for the present study five flood events with different characteristics were used table 1 and fig 2 the flood events were selected based on sensor availability lighting conditions for the cameras and the occurrence of flooding in the basement 2 2 conventional sensor data data from five conventional sensors were used to support this study flow into the facility was measured with a magnetic inductive flow meter situated in the pipe leading to the inlet of the flood facility this inflow data was used as input data for the swmm model in addition three ultrasonic rangefinders provide water level at three locations where accumulation would occur the pond basement and outlet shaft the error of these sensors is assumed to be negligible ultrasonic water level data is both used as reference data and is degraded into ideal and noisy proxy data the characteristics of each sensor are listed in table 2 2 3 proxy water level measurements in this study the sofi measurement method introduced by moy de vitry et al 2019a and briefly described in section 1 2 was investigated as a proxy for water level different qualities of sofi data both real and hypothetical are explored table 3 provides an overview of the data series created which are explained in the following sections 2 3 1 raw proxy measurements from surveillance cameras raw proxy measurements raw were obtained from surveillance footage of the pond using the sofi method described in section 1 2 and by moy de vitry et al 2019a as can be seen in the example frame provided in fig 4 the image quality did not always allow clear differentiation between flooded and wet surfaces this ambiguity is reflected in the results of the dcnn prediction and in the proxy measurements where noise with a complex correlation structure is visible fig 3f the spearman correlation of the raw proxy measurements with the sensor data varies between 40 and 80 from event to event see table s1 in the supporting information 2 3 2 synthetic ideal proxy data ideal proxy data ideal 100 was created by normalizing water level sensor data thus retaining 100 correlation with the water level but losing all absolute water level information it represents perfect proxy measurements that could be obtained if the image segmentation was improved to be error free and if moving visual obstructions could be avoided fig 3a although proxy data of such high quality may not be obtainable from surveillance cameras and automatic image analysis such data could come from an uncalibrated water level sensor within the sewer network for the purpose of this study these ideal synthetic proxy data allow the theoretic potential of proxy measurements for model calibration to be assessed 2 3 3 synthetic proxy data with complex correlated noise to assess the impact of noise on the utility of proxy data for calibration the level of noise in the raw proxy measurements was modified to predefined levels cor 60 to cor 90 see table 3 the modification was performed by linear combination of the raw proxy measurements with the ideal proxy data to achieve synthetic proxy data with the same noise structure as the raw proxy measurements fig 3g j the method for combining the raw and ideal proxy measurements is described in the supporting information section s1 2 3 4 synthetic proxy data with gaussian noise synthetic proxy data with pure gaussian noise were created to provide further insight into the role of error structure on model calibration gau 60 to gau 90 see table 3 these synthetic proxy data fig 3b e were created by linear combinations of gaussian distributed noise with the ideal proxy data as described in the supporting information in section s1 the synthetic proxy data gaussian noise were designed to have the same spearman correlation with the sensor data as the synthetic proxy data with complex correlated noise 2 4 hydraulic modelling with epa swmm to model the flood events the epa swmm 5 1 software rossman 2010 was used for both the drainage system and the surface flows epa swmm aka swmm is an established urban drainage modelling software that has the additional advantage of being open source which facilitates dissemination of this work swmm only allows creation of one dimensional models but this was not critical thanks to the simplicity of the flooding in the experimental catchment the surface flows which had mostly been channeled with sandbags were approximated as conduit links in the model depressions where water could pond were modelled as storage nodes with appropriate depth area curves the high similarity between simulations and measurements confirmed that the use of a 1d model was acceptable 2 5 model calibration and evaluation 2 5 1 calibration parameters seven parameters were selected for calibration based on the uncertainty or heuristic nature of their values these parameters including their respective value ranges are provided in table 4 these parameters were selected for calibration because their values were not measured or could not be directly measured during the experiments the roughness of pipe p3 is considered separately from that of other pipes because pipe p3 has sharp bends that could increase flow resistance 2 5 2 calibration algorithm calibration was conducted with the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 a global search algorithm implemented in the spotpy python package houska et al 2018 the sce ua algorithm begins with points sampled randomly in the parameter space and divided into groups complexes optimization is conducted in cycles wherein the complexes are incrementally optimized in parallel complex competitive evolution at the end of each evolution cycle if stopping criteria are not met then information is shared shuffled between all complexes and a new cycle begins the competitive evolution gives sce ua efficiency and the complex shuffling exploits the information contained in the initial population when the stopping criteria are met the parameter combination that gave the best performance during the whole calibration procedure is retained with the 10 fold repetition of each calibration exercise a qualitative understanding of uncertainty can be gained sce ua does not have parameters that need to be tuned unlike algorithms such as simulated annealing which is favorable for conducting automatic calibration on different combinations of data 2 5 3 objective function for proxy data the original spearman rank order correlation coefficient spearman 1904 measures the degree of association between two synchronous signals and was previously used for the study presented by van meerveld et al 2017 to assimilate categorical proxy measurements for the water level of rivers the spearman rank order correlation coefficient or spearman correlation is suited for comparisons between signals of differing orders of magnitude even with non linear relationships the coefficient is computed by first determining the relative rank of each signal value and computing the pearson correlation coefficient between the ranks for signals with duplicate values ranks can be tied and the spearman correlation ρ is then given by ρ x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 where x i and y i are the ranks of the two signals for time step i and where x and y are the mean ranks of the sofi and water level signals respectively a spearman correlation of 1 indicates a perfectly monotonic increasing relationship between two signals whereas a correlation of 0 indicates absence of correlation positive or negative between two signals in the present study the implementation of the spearman correlation of the pandas python library mckinney 2010 was used the spearman correlation cannot be computed if all data points in one of the series has the same rank as this leads to a division by zero this was problematic for flood events 2 and 4 of this study for which no flooding occurs in the basement leading to all zero values in the water level in literature the issue of undefined objective functions has been solved by modifying the objective function to remove singularities haupt et al 2009 this solution is not satisfactory for the current problem because although it would be possible to add terms to avoid singularity the resulting function would have a constant value in situations without flooding thus for flood events 2 and 4 calibration with proxy data from the basement would not be possible the solution found was to use the intersection over union iou to evaluate the agreement between the proxy and sensor data when either signal has only zero values i o u n s 0 t 0 n s 0 t 0 where n s 0 t 0 is the number of time steps for which both the sensor data and proxy measurements have values of zero and n s 0 t 0 is the number of time steps for which either the sensor data or the proxy data have values of zero the iou also varies between 0 no agreement and 1 perfect agreement in this study a hybrid spearman correlation that combines the iou and spearman correlation was used to evaluate model simulations with proxy data ρ i o u i o u i f a n y s i g n a l h a s o n l y z e r o v a l u e s ρ i f n e i t h e r s i g n a l h a s o n l y z e r o v a l u e s again this metric reaches a value of 1 for perfect correspondence between the two signals another possible solution to the problem of signals with only zero values would have been to append identical non zero values to both signals 2 5 4 aggregated objective function the sce ua algorithm is a single objective search algorithm so when calibrating with multiple data sources the objective functions need to be aggregated aggregation of multiple objective functions is common in hydrological modeling madsen 2003 was among the first to demonstrate this approach for a catchment with multiple measurement locations and measurement types more recently garcia et al 2017 combined two objective functions to fit both high and low flow regimes vis et al 2015 also used function aggregation with the particularity of combining up to four objective functions of different types the spearman correlation being among them in all cases the aggregate objective functions lead to satisfactory model calibration the aggregated objective function used in this study is a weighted sum of the root mean square of errors rmse for available sensor data and the hybrid spearman correlation ρ i o u for proxy data since the sce ua algorithm performs minimization of the objective function the hybrid spearman correlation was inverted so the best attainable value is zero additionally the hybrid spearman correlations were given a weight of 0 5 because the expected range of the spearman correlation is about twice that of rmse values o f i r m s e i 0 5 j 1 ρ i o u j where i represents locations where sensor data is available and j represents locations where proxy data are available the weight of 0 5 was validated by comparing the distributions of the combined rmse terms μ 0 27 σ 0 14 and the weighted spearman terms μ 0 36 σ 0 11 for flood event 1 with all measurement locations and uniformly sampled parameters 2 5 5 convergence criteria and computation cost the sce ua algorithm was run with seven simultaneous complex evolutions mirroring the number of calibration parameters calibration was considered successful if the value of the objective function did not improve more than 0 5 over five consecutive evolution cycles the algorithm was capped by an upper limit of 2000 model runs but this limit was rarely reached a typical model calibration took approximately 1500 s on a computer with 8 gb of ram and an intel core i7 3770k 3 5 ghz processor 2 5 6 evaluation of model performance with benchmarks model prediction error was evaluated with the sum of rmses computed by comparing the simulated water level with the sensor data at the pond basement and outlet shaft r m s e r m s e p o n d r m s e b a s e m e n t r m s e o u t l e t while in practice the different errors are usually weighed based on the desired application of the model the present model did not have a clearly defined application and differentiated weighting would be arbitrary in order to evaluate model performance despite flooding events of different magnitudes a model performance index was used to normalize each of the five flood experiments separately doing so makes it possible to aggregate the performance of multiple events without having one event with consistently large errors dominate the results the performance index chosen described by seibert et al 2018 uses an upper benchmark that represents the best attainable model performance with the available monitoring data and a lower benchmark that represents the expected model performance attainable without monitoring data in this study the upper benchmark was computed using sensor data for water level at all three measurement locations and the lower benchmark was computed as the median validation performance of 100 uncalibrated model realizations where parameter values were sampled with latin hypercube sampling lhs the normalized performance p i j of a model calibrated with a combination i of data sources see table 5 for the list of possible combinations and a flood event j can then be written as p i j r m s e l o w e r j r m s e i j r m s e l o w e r j r m s e u p p e r j this normalized model performance p i j takes values between 0 and 1 with 0 corresponding to the performance of an uncalibrated model and 1 corresponding to the performance of a model calibrated with all available data for that experiment the normalized model performance is always evaluated on events that were not used for model calibration using the normalized performance two aggregate performance indicators can be defined first the median model performance m p i is the median normalized model performance of one or multiple combinations i of data sources and all flood events m p i m e d i a n p i j j 1 5 second the marginal performance increase m p i i k is the median change in performance m p when adding an additional data source k either sensor data or proxy data to a given combination i of data sources the mpi provides a way to quantify the benefit of additional sensor or proxy data to a system in which some monitoring data is already available 2 6 calibration experiments 2 6 1 calibration with ideal proxy data in these experiments the value of calibrating with ideal noise free water level proxy data was compared to the value of calibrating with actual water level sensor data holding all other experimental variables like sensor location and measurement errors constant to perform this comparison the swmm model was calibrated with different combinations of either sensor data or the corresponding proxy data at the three monitoring locations pond basement or outlet shaft for example proxy data from the pond and sensor data from the outlet shaft are one possible combination but it was not allowed to calibrate with both proxy data and sensor data from the pond at the same time the full list of 26 possible combinations can be found in table 5 for each combination the model was calibrated 10 times on each of the five flood events each calibrated model was validated with the four other flood events 2 6 2 calibration with noisy proxy data the swmm model was also calibrated with the synthetic proxy data containing complex correlated noise and gaussian noise the objective was to gain insight into how the structure and magnitude of noise in proxy measurements affects the utility of proxy measurements for calibration the synthetic proxy data allow an isolation of the effects of noise structure and magnitude e g fig 3g j share the same noise structure first the situation was considered where only noisy proxy data from the pond are available second the situation was considered where noisy proxy data from the pond were complemented by ideal proxy data from the basement for each situation and each quality of proxy data the swmm model was calibrated 10 times on each of the five flood events each calibrated model was then validated with the four other flood events 3 results 3 1 model calibration with ideal proxy data to illustrate typical model calibration results hydrographs for event 5 are plotted for an uncalibrated model fig 5 a a model calibrated with sensor data at all three possible measurement locations fig 5b and a model calibrated with ideal proxy data ideal 100 at the same locations fig 5c while the level of agreement is very high for the calibrated models certain features of the curves do not perfectly fit the measured data in the pond for example simulated flooding ends more abruptly than the measured data these differences can be due to simplifying assumptions used when setting up the model or small inconsistencies between where the water level was measured and where it is reported from the model comparing the models calibrated with sensor data fig 5b vs with proxy data fig 5c the proxy based calibration gives priority to matching the end of the flooding in the basement and at the outlet shaft as expected it is surprising that although only proxy data are used for the model shown in fig 5c the absolute errors are still relatively small calibration experiments that failed to converge were filtered out of the dataset such failures occurred almost exclusively when calibrating with trend like data in the basement from event 3 this issue which appears to be caused by a local minimum in the objective function is documented in the supporting information section s3 3 2 benchmarks fig 6 shows the distribution of absolute modelling error achieved for uncalibrated models blue and for models calibrated with all available sensor data red the calibrated models have such consistent performance that variability is not visible at the scale of the figure the diamonds indicate the median model error of each case which are used for the upper and lower benchmarks described in section 2 5 6 flood event 5 stands out from the other events with higher error rates for both the upper and lower benchmarks this difference can probably be explained by the fact that flood event 5 involved roughly two times the water volume compared to the other events see table 1 resulting in higher water levels and therefore higher possible errors 3 3 ideal proxy data would be competition for sensor data this section presents the results of the first calibration experiment described in section 2 6 which explores the calibration value of ideal proxy data ideal 100 which represent a hypothetical situation where surveillance footage analysis has been perfected and no moving obstructions affect the measurement in fig 7 the 26 data source combinations have been summarized by the number of proxy and sensor data sources used the model performance distributions are depicted with boxplots showing the median 25th and 75th percentiles the whiskers show the full extent of each distribution but extend at most 1 5 times the inter quartile range the distance between the 25th and 75th percentiles any data beyond that limit are considered outliers and plotted as individual points the situation where neither sensor nor proxy data are used left most boxplot in fig 7 groups together all uncalibrated model runs for which median model performance mp is zero by definition of the lower benchmark in section 2 5 6 as the number of data sources used for calibration increases performance tends to increase as well as might be expected models calibrated with sensor data perform better than models calibrated with the same number of proxy data sources even models calibrated with just two sensors mp 97 tend to perform better than models calibrated with three proxy data sources mp 90 2 models calibrated with just one data source have high variability in performance both for sensor and proxy data different factors contribute to the variability in performance one factor is that model performance depends not only on the type proxy or sensor of the data used for calibration but also on their location pond basement or outlet shaft for example upstream measurement locations are less informative than downstream measurement locations in certain cases some of the parameters remain poorly defined after calibration another factor is linked to the discrepancies between model and measurement which are visible in the calibrated models plotted in fig 5b and c these discrepancies represent a risk of overfitting if only certain locations are available for calibration and overfitting leads to higher errors during validation which is always performed with all measurement locations an example and analysis of overfitting is provided in the supporting information section s4 diving deeper into the results fig 8 presents the marginal performance increase mpi when adding a data source either a sensor or an ideal proxy measurement at a given location for various initial data source combinations initial data source combinations are defined by the number of sensors and or proxy measurements used for calibration as indicated on the heatmap axes for example the 94 of the heat map in the upper right tells us that compared to the median uncalibrated model zero initial sensors and zero initial proxy measurements adding a sensor to the outlet shaft will result in a median increase of 94 percentage points median value since there are multiple variations for each situation for instance different flood events to calibrate on the mpi is computed as the median increase of mp across all possible combinations as might be expected the highest mpi is achieved when adding a sensor or proxy measurement to an initially ungauged system lower left of each heatmap as the number of initial measurement locations rises and the system is saturated with data the mpi decreases thus mpi is under 5 for all situations where two sensors are already present in the system uppermost cell in each heatmap there are systematic differences between the three measurement locations adding a data source to the pond which is furthest upstream in the catchment has the lowest impact whereas a measurement in the outlet shaft which is furthest downstream increases the performance significantly more although sensor data delivers a higher mpi than proxy data at the outlet shaft proxy data generally provides a high improvement at the pond and in the basement again the surprising advantage of proxy data is linked to overfitting as described in the supporting information section s4 on average over all situations the median mpi from using additional proxy data is 5 8 whereas the median mpi from using additional sensor data is 10 1 by comparing proxy and sensor data on a case by case basis with each case representing an initial configuration of sensors and data and given calibration and validation events the mpi of proxy data is just over 70 that of sensor data from the same location median value 3 4 costs and benefits of noise in this section the impact of noise on the calibration value of proxy data is assessed both complex correlated noise and simple gaussian noise are assessed with the help of the synthetic proxy data presented in section 2 3 this analysis has an illustrative purpose and limits itself to two situations that have measurements at the pond and or in the basement these locations were selected because measurements at the outlet shaft are too redundant with the other two locations 3 4 1 situation 1 calibration with proxy data from pond only in the first situation a single measurement point at the pond is available at the pond the following possible data are considered none uncalibrated sensor data ideal proxy data proxy data with gaussian noise fig 9 a and proxy data with complex correlated noise fig 9b the situation with no data data series at pond none corresponds to the uncalibrated model simulations from which the lower benchmark was computed compared to the uncalibrated models models calibrated with ideal proxy data ideal 100 or with sensor data have higher performance and lower variability nevertheless variability is still high with a significant portion of models performing worse than the median uncalibrated model this variability has to do with parameter uncertainty and overfitting as discussed in relation to fig 7 overfitting is also the reason why models calibrated with ideal 100 have a higher mp 48 than those calibrated with sensor data 35 as explained in the supporting information section s4 the presence of gaussian noise does not seem to have a strong negative impact on the mp which hovers below 50 for all quality levels above gau 60 fig 10 a for gau 60 overall performance is lower closer to that of the uncalibrated models surprisingly it appears that overall performance is highest for gau 80 which could be linked to a reduction of the overfitting mentioned in the previous paragraph correlated errors fig 9b have a visible impact on model performance with the mp for cor 60 near 0 nevertheless the overall performance is improved by a reduction in variance as compared to the uncalibrated models as the quality of the proxy data increases the calibration performance increases as well although the change is slight and even cor 90 has a distinctly lower performance than ideal 100 further differences appear when distinguishing performance based on the event used for calibration a discussion of the differences is provided in the supporting information section s5 3 4 2 situation 2 calibration with proxy data from pond and basement the second situation is equivalent to the first except that the noisy proxy data from the pond are supplemented with ideal proxy data ideal 100 from the basement fig 10 the base case data series at pond none now corresponds to models calibrated only with ideal proxy data from the basement hence the improved performance relative to fig 9 considering that the performance with sensor data at the pond is now clearly better than the performance with ideal proxy data at the pond it now appears that the problem with overfitting which occurred in absence of other data sources fig 9 is resolved again the proxy data with gaussian noise are not systematically worse than the proxy data with no noise fig 10a although the variability is higher for all cases the mp is higher than if only calibrating with ideal trend like data from the basement the none base case even gau 60 for which the noise previously appeared to negatively affect the mp performs no worse than the other proxy data series with gaussian noise in contrast calibrating with trend like data with complex correlated noise decreases the mp as compared to the base case fig 10b even when the magnitude of noise is small cor 90 performance does seem to correlate positively with data quality but the relationship is weak the poorly performing models and increased variability for cor 80 and cor 90 are again linked to overfitting that occurs specifically when calibrating with events 2 and 4 which are the only events to lack flooding in the basement 4 discussion 4 1 significance of this work 4 1 1 importance and novelty no conventional sensor solution exists for measuring small scale surface flooding in urban areas even though such measurements are needed to ensure the reliability of models and thus the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures thanks to a unique case study this work sheds light on a new opportunity for urban pluvial flood model calibration with alternative data sources namely with proxy data automatically obtained from surveillance footage the aspect of automatic image analysis is particularly important for privacy reasons which are one of the main risks associated to smart urban water solutions moy de vitry et al 2019b while many studies have looked into the collection of flooding data from alternative sources including social media and drones few are known to have investigated the actual benefits that such data provides this work tackles that question specifically while at the same time differentiating between sensor placement and different data qualities 4 1 2 why overfitting was tolerated discrepancies between model and data which sometimes led to overfitting were observed in this study these discrepancies were tolerated even though they complicated the analysis and could have been resolved e g by optimizing model structure the presence of such discrepancies can be attributed to the realism of the case study which gives significant practical value to the findings in particular this rather unique approach reduces the risk of overestimating the value of trend like data as might occur when using simulated data viero 2018 4 2 could cameras replace sensors 4 2 1 error free proxy data are almost as useful as sensor data in this study ideal error free proxy data were used to calibrate a simple flash flood model and were found to improve validation performance of the model in a consistent manner this finding suggests that proxy measurements have the potential to satisfy the lack of monitoring data for urban pluvial flood model calibration other studies have come to comparable conclusions for other alternative data sources for example regarding the use of citizen science to calibrate hydrologic river models van meerveld et al 2017 or the use of binary sensors to calibrate an urban drainage model wani et al 2017 this study also found that the difference in value between sensor data and error free proxy data is smaller than might be expected in more than half of all the calibration situations analyzed proxy data provided at least 70 of the benefit of sensor data to take a more specific example calibrating with proxy data at all available locations provided a median performance that was only 4 5 poorer than when calibrating with sensor data at the same locations in situations where overfitting is a risk such as when calibrating with only one upstream measurement in a catchment the results point to the surprising conclusion that ideal proxy data can provide more robust models than sensor data this was explained by the fact that proxy based calibration is less opinionated as compared to calibration with sensor data and objective functions that favor perfect fitting of the model to measurement values 4 2 2 measurement noise is usually detrimental the proxy data that were automatically extracted from surveillance footage of the case study contained noise and although there are ways to reduce it it is unlikely that such noise can be completely resolved the errors are due to classification problems and changes in the flooding scene moy de vitry et al 2019a and they have a complex autocorrelation structure in the present study the effect of complex correlated noise was usually detrimental in the worst cases even the proxy data with the lowest level of noise cor 90 would give significantly lower performance than the ideal proxy data ideal 100 gaussian noise random noise with low autocorrelation in contrast to complex correlated noise had a vastly different effect on performance when calibrating with proxy data from the pond alone then only the highest noise level gau 60 provoked a clear reduction in performance compared to the ideal proxy data in the other cases performance was similar or even higher than the ideal proxy data compared to previous research that suggests that random noise in calibration data do not have a strong negative effect during calibration dotto et al 2014 we go a step further and suggest that some noise could even be beneficial in situations where model overfitting is a risk it follows that until complex correlated noise is kept below an acceptable threshold which remains to be defined proxy data obtained from surveillance footage should be used for calibration only with extreme care possible approaches for reducing errors have been outlined by moy de vitry et al 2019a until then proxy based calibration should be limited to the assimilation of proxy data with uncorrelated errors such as proxy measurements from uncalibrated conventional sensors data from uncalibrated sensors do have systematic errors but these do not affect the trend information contained in the data 4 3 outlook and future research 4 3 1 suitability of the spearman correlation for calibrating proxy data the hybrid spearman correlation used in this study was effective in fitting the swmm model to the shape of the proxy data even when a large amount of noise was present the use of the iou in cases where the proxy data were flat e g when no flooding occurred in the basement proved to be effective for calibration although future research could investigate whether there are better alternatives to the proposed solution there are situations in which calibration with the spearman correlation is difficult for flood event 3 which involves a very short and shallow flood in the basement calibrations were sometimes unsuccessful because they would stop at a local minimum it appears that such issues could be avoided by making the calibration stopping criteria more strict a strong downside of the spearman correlation for describing data quality is that it is not very telling of the noise structure as seen in the results two proxy measurements with the same spearman correlation can give very different results during calibration better characterization of the noise structure would possibly also allow for correlated errors in the measurement data to be accounted for 4 3 2 further experiments are necessary the floodx data sets are of unique value thanks to their provision of multiple flood events on which flood models can be calibrated and validated nevertheless they are limited due to the small size of the facility in this study the small catchment size meant that with three sensors redundancy was higher than what is expected in a real catchment with perhaps a thousand times more components this led to interdependence between measurement locations meaning that it was not completely possible to isolate the effect of measurement location from the effect of other measurements thus larger case studies should be considered in the future measurement location was found to have a strong influence on the value of the monitoring data which underlines the importance of research for identification of optimal sensor placement for monitoring campaigns vonach et al 2018 compared to reality the flooding events studied in this paper lacked rainfall runoff processes in cases where these processes need to be modelled they can introduce parameter uncertainty that might shift the need for monitoring data upstream therefore it is also important that future case studies include such rainfall runoff processes it is expected that these processes increase modelling complexity and uncertainty thereby increasing the need for data especially surface flooding data and the potential benefit of proxy measurements as this study focused only on proxy measurements for water level from cameras using the sofi method future studies should consider combining sofi proxy measurements with other data sources examples include flow velocity data from surveillance cameras leitão et al 2018 citizens le boursicaud et al 2016 and drones perks et al 2016 or water level information obtained from social media chaudhary et al 2019 4 3 3 implications for model calibration with alternative data sources in this study the identifiability of parameters was found to depend on measurement location data type and data quality for example proxy data from the pond was found to provide only limited information on parameters downstream in certain cases this led to the selection of extreme parameter values in future studies calibration parameters should be defined according to a sensitivity analysis based on the available measurement data alternatively parameters that remain undefined after calibration should be assigned a value based on prior knowledge while a bayesian approach may be applicable in certain cases the definition of appropriate likelihood functions may be difficult as in the case of proxy data the presence of complex correlated noise was found to be a critical factor influencing model calibration in this study since such noise might be expected in practice a method is needed to identify and screen erroneous data before calibration accurate characterization of noise structure is also necessary for effective bayesian parameter estimation wani et al 2019 the spearman correlation seems to be an insufficient indicator of quality in this regard a similar call was issued concerning erroneous crowd sourced data in hydrological modelling mazzoleni et al 2017 once the reliability of a data source has been assessed it can be used or rejected based on a threshold alternatively when calibrating with multiple sources of data the reliability of each source can be used to weigh its objective function so that information that is more reliable has more significance 5 conclusions the lack of overland flood monitoring data is a recognized issue in urban pluvial flood modelling but in most situations conventional sensor solutions are very impractical if not impossible to deploy alternative data sources like social media and surveillance cameras appeal as a novel and cost effective approach to the problem this study assessed the potential of proxy measurements such as could be obtained from surveillance footage by automatically tracking the evolution of the visible flood extent with computer vision data from five flood events were used to calibrate and validate a one dimensional dual drainage epa swmm model with different combinations of proxy and sensor data overall the results showed that ideal proxy data with no errors or with gaussian noise are almost as useful as sensor data however the complex correlated errors currently featured in camera sourced proxy measurements are detrimental and can completely cancel any benefits of the proxy data the use of multiple measurement locations for calibration is also important for model performance the main contributions of this study are an objective function based on the spearman rank correlation coefficient was proposed and demonstrated for calibrating with water level proxy data it worked in most cases but experienced difficulty with one very short and shallow flooding event the results confirmed that proxy data have a strong potential to improve a urban pluvial flood model s predictive performance for example models calibrated with three ideal proxy data series had a median performance of 90 that of a perfectly calibrated model however complex correlated noise reduces the utility of proxy data and can even be counter productive gaussian noise was generally unproblematic and was sometimes beneficial in making the model more robust inevitable discrepancies in the model and data for example due to modelling assumptions can be harmless if a sufficient number of measurements are available too few measurements can lead to overfitting in which case performance was sometimes improved when data contained gaussian noise the spearman correlation is not a sufficient indicator of the presence of complex correlated noise as opposed to random gaussian noise which is a critical factor for model calibration in practice alternative data sources such as surveillance cameras are not expected to provide perfect data so the issue of data quality assessment and screening should be investigated further code and data availability the code used in this work for creating training and evaluating the dcnn as well as

18025,urban pluvial flood models need to be calibrated with data from actual flood events in order to validate and improve model performance due to the lack of conventional sensor solutions alternative sources of data such as citizen science social media and surveillance cameras have been proposed in literature some of the methods proposed boast high scalability but without an on site survey they can only provide proxy measurements for physical flooding variables such as water level in this study the potential value of such proxy measurements was evaluated by calibrating an urban pluvial flood model with data from experimental flood events conducted in a 25 25 m facility monitored with surveillance cameras and conventional sensors in parallel both ideal proxy data and actual image based proxy measurements with noise were tested and the effects of measurement location and measurement noise were investigated separately the results with error free proxy data confirm the theoretic potential of such measurements as in half of the calibration configurations tested ideal proxy data increases model performance by at least 70 compared to sensor data however image based proxy data can contain complex correlated errors which have a complex and predominantly negative effect on performance keywords urban pluvial flooding proxy measurements flood monitoring model calibration measurement error sensor placement 1 introduction 1 1 the need for flood monitoring data urban pluvial floods also known as nuisance floods or flash floods occur when a city s drainage system does not have the capacity to drain local rainfall during storms as climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall events field et al 2012 it is expected that the frequency and intensity of urban pluvial floods will also increase such flooding is further aggravated by the reduction of pervious surfaces due to urbanization skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 according to certain studies the societal cost of urban pluvial flooding is comparable to that of coastal or river flooding because these tend to occur less frequently jiang et al 2018 ten veldhuis 2011 the issue of urban pluvial floods is of growing importance and demands adequate planning and mitigation tools to assess the risk of urban pluvial flooding and design prevention solutions urban drainage experts use numerical models tools to simulate the flow and accumulation of water in urban catchments these models can be of varying complexity depending mainly on how surface flow is represented the completeness of the flow equations solved if any and the complexity of sewer surface interactions if any overviews of the different numerical models used for urban flood modelling can be found in literature ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 zoppou 2001 regardless of the model used there are often parameters with poorly defined values which can introduce uncertainty in the modelling results but despite the recognized necessity of calibration to reduce these uncertainties calibration of urban drainage models is rarely performed in practice tscheikner gratl et al 2016 the probable cause for this is a lack of monitoring data thorndahl et al 2008 a problem that is aggravated when it comes to measuring surface flooding conventional sensors designed for sewer pipes or well defined channels are not suited to the open urban environment with its complex geometries moving objects and risk of vandalism 1 2 proxy water level measurements from images the difficulty in monitoring urban pluvial floods with conventional sensors has encouraged researchers to explore alternative sources of flooding data such as social media assumpção et al 2018 chaudhary et al 2019 hénonin et al 2015 wang et al 2018 or surveillance cameras bhola et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 leitão et al 2018 lv et al 2018 moy de vitry et al 2019a of the different methods proposed that of moy de vitry et al 2019a stands out because the measurements obtained do not correspond directly to a physical flooding variable but instead contain information on how the water level changes over time the method exploits the assumption that the amount of visible water in the images of a static surveillance camera is associated with the actual flooding water level concretely the method uses a deep convolutional neural network dcnn to periodically segment water in images from a static surveillance camera the area covered by water in each image is expressed as a fraction of the whole image and called the static observer flood index sofi when the method was proposed it was tested on a range of different surveillance video qualities and contexts outdoors and indoors during night and day etc the initial results showed that sofi data had an average correlation of 75 with the actual water level although the variability between videos was high minimum of around 35 maximum around 90 this correlation though imperfect established sofi as a proxy measurement for flood water level the original publication describes the method and results in detail and lists measures by which the quality of the sofi measurements can be improved although the information type provided by sofi is non standard the method has a potential advantage in scalability that justifies further study in principle the assumption sofi relies on association of water level with visible water is so general that sofi can be applied to any static surveillance camera footage without the need for any on site measurements thus sofi is well suited to very large networks of surveillance cameras especially those for which privacy is an issue and human access to the footage is restricted 1 3 hydraulic and hydrologic model calibration with proxy measurements a measurement can be considered a proxy for a physical variable if it has a correlation with that variable in urban pluvial flood modelling proxy measurements could be obtained via surveillance cameras as described in section 1 2 or from conventional sensors that were not correctly calibrated proxy measurements differ from conventional sensor data in that they contain information not in the absolute values of the data but in the shape of the data series as proxy measurements cannot be directly compared with the values of a model simulation metrics like the nash sutcliffe efficiency which is commonly used for model calibration cannot be used despite this challenge the lack of suitable sensing techniques motivates the investigation of how proxy measurements could help calibrate urban pluvial flood models while there are no known examples from urban flood modelling model calibration with proxy measurements has been performed in stream hydrology where van meerveld et al 2017 investigated the value of stream level classes reported by citizen scientists the authors successfully used the spearman rank correlation coefficient spearman 1904 as an objective function for calibration to maximize correlation between observed stream level classes and the linked but not equivalent stream discharge represented as a state variable the spearman rank correlation has also been used in another study jian et al 2017 to calibrate a hydrologic model with water level data without a rating curve which is an equivalent problem 1 4 objective of the current study the objective of this study is to assess the value of proxy measurements as compared to data from conventional sensors when calibrating an urban pluvial flood model the motivation to investigate proxy measurements from alternative data sources is the need for monitoring data for numeric model calibration and the lack of conventional sensor solutions in particular the study uses the sofi method moy de vitry et al 2019a as a possible source of proxy measurements using a large lab like setup the study first investigated the potential value of ideal noise free proxy data under different measurement configurations second the study investigated the impact that noise in proxy measurements have on model performance after calibration noise with a complex correlated structure and with a gaussian distribution were considered separately due to the restricted dimensions of the setup and the experimental nature of the flooding events simulated the aim of this study was primarily of exploratory nature to assess the novel concept of urban pluvial flood model calibration with proxy water level measurements 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental urban catchment for flood events the data used in this study was collected in a 25 25 m lab like facility the facility is a simplified urban catchment with a drainage network and a small building with a basement that can be flooded fig 1 designed for training civil protection forces for flood events the facility was temporarily outfitted with sensors and cameras to collect unique datasets that were documented and shared in previous work moy de vitry et al 2017 the datasets provide both conventional monitoring data and surveillance video documentation for multiple flash flood events despite the facility s limited size it was possible to reproduce different phenomena common to urban pluvial flooding such as shallow overland flow manhole overflow ponding and basement flooding however rainfall runoff processes could not be reproduced in the catchment from the original experiments four sensors and one camera were selected for inclusion in this study a magnetic inductive flow meter provides data about the flow of water into the system and three ultrasonic water level sensors provide flood level data at three separate locations of the catchment the ultrasonic sensors and camera provide the calibration data for this study as described in sections 2 2 2 3 and 2 6 each flood event consisted in manually regulating a valve to let water from a reservoir into the facility for the present study five flood events with different characteristics were used table 1 and fig 2 the flood events were selected based on sensor availability lighting conditions for the cameras and the occurrence of flooding in the basement 2 2 conventional sensor data data from five conventional sensors were used to support this study flow into the facility was measured with a magnetic inductive flow meter situated in the pipe leading to the inlet of the flood facility this inflow data was used as input data for the swmm model in addition three ultrasonic rangefinders provide water level at three locations where accumulation would occur the pond basement and outlet shaft the error of these sensors is assumed to be negligible ultrasonic water level data is both used as reference data and is degraded into ideal and noisy proxy data the characteristics of each sensor are listed in table 2 2 3 proxy water level measurements in this study the sofi measurement method introduced by moy de vitry et al 2019a and briefly described in section 1 2 was investigated as a proxy for water level different qualities of sofi data both real and hypothetical are explored table 3 provides an overview of the data series created which are explained in the following sections 2 3 1 raw proxy measurements from surveillance cameras raw proxy measurements raw were obtained from surveillance footage of the pond using the sofi method described in section 1 2 and by moy de vitry et al 2019a as can be seen in the example frame provided in fig 4 the image quality did not always allow clear differentiation between flooded and wet surfaces this ambiguity is reflected in the results of the dcnn prediction and in the proxy measurements where noise with a complex correlation structure is visible fig 3f the spearman correlation of the raw proxy measurements with the sensor data varies between 40 and 80 from event to event see table s1 in the supporting information 2 3 2 synthetic ideal proxy data ideal proxy data ideal 100 was created by normalizing water level sensor data thus retaining 100 correlation with the water level but losing all absolute water level information it represents perfect proxy measurements that could be obtained if the image segmentation was improved to be error free and if moving visual obstructions could be avoided fig 3a although proxy data of such high quality may not be obtainable from surveillance cameras and automatic image analysis such data could come from an uncalibrated water level sensor within the sewer network for the purpose of this study these ideal synthetic proxy data allow the theoretic potential of proxy measurements for model calibration to be assessed 2 3 3 synthetic proxy data with complex correlated noise to assess the impact of noise on the utility of proxy data for calibration the level of noise in the raw proxy measurements was modified to predefined levels cor 60 to cor 90 see table 3 the modification was performed by linear combination of the raw proxy measurements with the ideal proxy data to achieve synthetic proxy data with the same noise structure as the raw proxy measurements fig 3g j the method for combining the raw and ideal proxy measurements is described in the supporting information section s1 2 3 4 synthetic proxy data with gaussian noise synthetic proxy data with pure gaussian noise were created to provide further insight into the role of error structure on model calibration gau 60 to gau 90 see table 3 these synthetic proxy data fig 3b e were created by linear combinations of gaussian distributed noise with the ideal proxy data as described in the supporting information in section s1 the synthetic proxy data gaussian noise were designed to have the same spearman correlation with the sensor data as the synthetic proxy data with complex correlated noise 2 4 hydraulic modelling with epa swmm to model the flood events the epa swmm 5 1 software rossman 2010 was used for both the drainage system and the surface flows epa swmm aka swmm is an established urban drainage modelling software that has the additional advantage of being open source which facilitates dissemination of this work swmm only allows creation of one dimensional models but this was not critical thanks to the simplicity of the flooding in the experimental catchment the surface flows which had mostly been channeled with sandbags were approximated as conduit links in the model depressions where water could pond were modelled as storage nodes with appropriate depth area curves the high similarity between simulations and measurements confirmed that the use of a 1d model was acceptable 2 5 model calibration and evaluation 2 5 1 calibration parameters seven parameters were selected for calibration based on the uncertainty or heuristic nature of their values these parameters including their respective value ranges are provided in table 4 these parameters were selected for calibration because their values were not measured or could not be directly measured during the experiments the roughness of pipe p3 is considered separately from that of other pipes because pipe p3 has sharp bends that could increase flow resistance 2 5 2 calibration algorithm calibration was conducted with the shuffled complex evolution university of arizona sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 a global search algorithm implemented in the spotpy python package houska et al 2018 the sce ua algorithm begins with points sampled randomly in the parameter space and divided into groups complexes optimization is conducted in cycles wherein the complexes are incrementally optimized in parallel complex competitive evolution at the end of each evolution cycle if stopping criteria are not met then information is shared shuffled between all complexes and a new cycle begins the competitive evolution gives sce ua efficiency and the complex shuffling exploits the information contained in the initial population when the stopping criteria are met the parameter combination that gave the best performance during the whole calibration procedure is retained with the 10 fold repetition of each calibration exercise a qualitative understanding of uncertainty can be gained sce ua does not have parameters that need to be tuned unlike algorithms such as simulated annealing which is favorable for conducting automatic calibration on different combinations of data 2 5 3 objective function for proxy data the original spearman rank order correlation coefficient spearman 1904 measures the degree of association between two synchronous signals and was previously used for the study presented by van meerveld et al 2017 to assimilate categorical proxy measurements for the water level of rivers the spearman rank order correlation coefficient or spearman correlation is suited for comparisons between signals of differing orders of magnitude even with non linear relationships the coefficient is computed by first determining the relative rank of each signal value and computing the pearson correlation coefficient between the ranks for signals with duplicate values ranks can be tied and the spearman correlation ρ is then given by ρ x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 where x i and y i are the ranks of the two signals for time step i and where x and y are the mean ranks of the sofi and water level signals respectively a spearman correlation of 1 indicates a perfectly monotonic increasing relationship between two signals whereas a correlation of 0 indicates absence of correlation positive or negative between two signals in the present study the implementation of the spearman correlation of the pandas python library mckinney 2010 was used the spearman correlation cannot be computed if all data points in one of the series has the same rank as this leads to a division by zero this was problematic for flood events 2 and 4 of this study for which no flooding occurs in the basement leading to all zero values in the water level in literature the issue of undefined objective functions has been solved by modifying the objective function to remove singularities haupt et al 2009 this solution is not satisfactory for the current problem because although it would be possible to add terms to avoid singularity the resulting function would have a constant value in situations without flooding thus for flood events 2 and 4 calibration with proxy data from the basement would not be possible the solution found was to use the intersection over union iou to evaluate the agreement between the proxy and sensor data when either signal has only zero values i o u n s 0 t 0 n s 0 t 0 where n s 0 t 0 is the number of time steps for which both the sensor data and proxy measurements have values of zero and n s 0 t 0 is the number of time steps for which either the sensor data or the proxy data have values of zero the iou also varies between 0 no agreement and 1 perfect agreement in this study a hybrid spearman correlation that combines the iou and spearman correlation was used to evaluate model simulations with proxy data ρ i o u i o u i f a n y s i g n a l h a s o n l y z e r o v a l u e s ρ i f n e i t h e r s i g n a l h a s o n l y z e r o v a l u e s again this metric reaches a value of 1 for perfect correspondence between the two signals another possible solution to the problem of signals with only zero values would have been to append identical non zero values to both signals 2 5 4 aggregated objective function the sce ua algorithm is a single objective search algorithm so when calibrating with multiple data sources the objective functions need to be aggregated aggregation of multiple objective functions is common in hydrological modeling madsen 2003 was among the first to demonstrate this approach for a catchment with multiple measurement locations and measurement types more recently garcia et al 2017 combined two objective functions to fit both high and low flow regimes vis et al 2015 also used function aggregation with the particularity of combining up to four objective functions of different types the spearman correlation being among them in all cases the aggregate objective functions lead to satisfactory model calibration the aggregated objective function used in this study is a weighted sum of the root mean square of errors rmse for available sensor data and the hybrid spearman correlation ρ i o u for proxy data since the sce ua algorithm performs minimization of the objective function the hybrid spearman correlation was inverted so the best attainable value is zero additionally the hybrid spearman correlations were given a weight of 0 5 because the expected range of the spearman correlation is about twice that of rmse values o f i r m s e i 0 5 j 1 ρ i o u j where i represents locations where sensor data is available and j represents locations where proxy data are available the weight of 0 5 was validated by comparing the distributions of the combined rmse terms μ 0 27 σ 0 14 and the weighted spearman terms μ 0 36 σ 0 11 for flood event 1 with all measurement locations and uniformly sampled parameters 2 5 5 convergence criteria and computation cost the sce ua algorithm was run with seven simultaneous complex evolutions mirroring the number of calibration parameters calibration was considered successful if the value of the objective function did not improve more than 0 5 over five consecutive evolution cycles the algorithm was capped by an upper limit of 2000 model runs but this limit was rarely reached a typical model calibration took approximately 1500 s on a computer with 8 gb of ram and an intel core i7 3770k 3 5 ghz processor 2 5 6 evaluation of model performance with benchmarks model prediction error was evaluated with the sum of rmses computed by comparing the simulated water level with the sensor data at the pond basement and outlet shaft r m s e r m s e p o n d r m s e b a s e m e n t r m s e o u t l e t while in practice the different errors are usually weighed based on the desired application of the model the present model did not have a clearly defined application and differentiated weighting would be arbitrary in order to evaluate model performance despite flooding events of different magnitudes a model performance index was used to normalize each of the five flood experiments separately doing so makes it possible to aggregate the performance of multiple events without having one event with consistently large errors dominate the results the performance index chosen described by seibert et al 2018 uses an upper benchmark that represents the best attainable model performance with the available monitoring data and a lower benchmark that represents the expected model performance attainable without monitoring data in this study the upper benchmark was computed using sensor data for water level at all three measurement locations and the lower benchmark was computed as the median validation performance of 100 uncalibrated model realizations where parameter values were sampled with latin hypercube sampling lhs the normalized performance p i j of a model calibrated with a combination i of data sources see table 5 for the list of possible combinations and a flood event j can then be written as p i j r m s e l o w e r j r m s e i j r m s e l o w e r j r m s e u p p e r j this normalized model performance p i j takes values between 0 and 1 with 0 corresponding to the performance of an uncalibrated model and 1 corresponding to the performance of a model calibrated with all available data for that experiment the normalized model performance is always evaluated on events that were not used for model calibration using the normalized performance two aggregate performance indicators can be defined first the median model performance m p i is the median normalized model performance of one or multiple combinations i of data sources and all flood events m p i m e d i a n p i j j 1 5 second the marginal performance increase m p i i k is the median change in performance m p when adding an additional data source k either sensor data or proxy data to a given combination i of data sources the mpi provides a way to quantify the benefit of additional sensor or proxy data to a system in which some monitoring data is already available 2 6 calibration experiments 2 6 1 calibration with ideal proxy data in these experiments the value of calibrating with ideal noise free water level proxy data was compared to the value of calibrating with actual water level sensor data holding all other experimental variables like sensor location and measurement errors constant to perform this comparison the swmm model was calibrated with different combinations of either sensor data or the corresponding proxy data at the three monitoring locations pond basement or outlet shaft for example proxy data from the pond and sensor data from the outlet shaft are one possible combination but it was not allowed to calibrate with both proxy data and sensor data from the pond at the same time the full list of 26 possible combinations can be found in table 5 for each combination the model was calibrated 10 times on each of the five flood events each calibrated model was validated with the four other flood events 2 6 2 calibration with noisy proxy data the swmm model was also calibrated with the synthetic proxy data containing complex correlated noise and gaussian noise the objective was to gain insight into how the structure and magnitude of noise in proxy measurements affects the utility of proxy measurements for calibration the synthetic proxy data allow an isolation of the effects of noise structure and magnitude e g fig 3g j share the same noise structure first the situation was considered where only noisy proxy data from the pond are available second the situation was considered where noisy proxy data from the pond were complemented by ideal proxy data from the basement for each situation and each quality of proxy data the swmm model was calibrated 10 times on each of the five flood events each calibrated model was then validated with the four other flood events 3 results 3 1 model calibration with ideal proxy data to illustrate typical model calibration results hydrographs for event 5 are plotted for an uncalibrated model fig 5 a a model calibrated with sensor data at all three possible measurement locations fig 5b and a model calibrated with ideal proxy data ideal 100 at the same locations fig 5c while the level of agreement is very high for the calibrated models certain features of the curves do not perfectly fit the measured data in the pond for example simulated flooding ends more abruptly than the measured data these differences can be due to simplifying assumptions used when setting up the model or small inconsistencies between where the water level was measured and where it is reported from the model comparing the models calibrated with sensor data fig 5b vs with proxy data fig 5c the proxy based calibration gives priority to matching the end of the flooding in the basement and at the outlet shaft as expected it is surprising that although only proxy data are used for the model shown in fig 5c the absolute errors are still relatively small calibration experiments that failed to converge were filtered out of the dataset such failures occurred almost exclusively when calibrating with trend like data in the basement from event 3 this issue which appears to be caused by a local minimum in the objective function is documented in the supporting information section s3 3 2 benchmarks fig 6 shows the distribution of absolute modelling error achieved for uncalibrated models blue and for models calibrated with all available sensor data red the calibrated models have such consistent performance that variability is not visible at the scale of the figure the diamonds indicate the median model error of each case which are used for the upper and lower benchmarks described in section 2 5 6 flood event 5 stands out from the other events with higher error rates for both the upper and lower benchmarks this difference can probably be explained by the fact that flood event 5 involved roughly two times the water volume compared to the other events see table 1 resulting in higher water levels and therefore higher possible errors 3 3 ideal proxy data would be competition for sensor data this section presents the results of the first calibration experiment described in section 2 6 which explores the calibration value of ideal proxy data ideal 100 which represent a hypothetical situation where surveillance footage analysis has been perfected and no moving obstructions affect the measurement in fig 7 the 26 data source combinations have been summarized by the number of proxy and sensor data sources used the model performance distributions are depicted with boxplots showing the median 25th and 75th percentiles the whiskers show the full extent of each distribution but extend at most 1 5 times the inter quartile range the distance between the 25th and 75th percentiles any data beyond that limit are considered outliers and plotted as individual points the situation where neither sensor nor proxy data are used left most boxplot in fig 7 groups together all uncalibrated model runs for which median model performance mp is zero by definition of the lower benchmark in section 2 5 6 as the number of data sources used for calibration increases performance tends to increase as well as might be expected models calibrated with sensor data perform better than models calibrated with the same number of proxy data sources even models calibrated with just two sensors mp 97 tend to perform better than models calibrated with three proxy data sources mp 90 2 models calibrated with just one data source have high variability in performance both for sensor and proxy data different factors contribute to the variability in performance one factor is that model performance depends not only on the type proxy or sensor of the data used for calibration but also on their location pond basement or outlet shaft for example upstream measurement locations are less informative than downstream measurement locations in certain cases some of the parameters remain poorly defined after calibration another factor is linked to the discrepancies between model and measurement which are visible in the calibrated models plotted in fig 5b and c these discrepancies represent a risk of overfitting if only certain locations are available for calibration and overfitting leads to higher errors during validation which is always performed with all measurement locations an example and analysis of overfitting is provided in the supporting information section s4 diving deeper into the results fig 8 presents the marginal performance increase mpi when adding a data source either a sensor or an ideal proxy measurement at a given location for various initial data source combinations initial data source combinations are defined by the number of sensors and or proxy measurements used for calibration as indicated on the heatmap axes for example the 94 of the heat map in the upper right tells us that compared to the median uncalibrated model zero initial sensors and zero initial proxy measurements adding a sensor to the outlet shaft will result in a median increase of 94 percentage points median value since there are multiple variations for each situation for instance different flood events to calibrate on the mpi is computed as the median increase of mp across all possible combinations as might be expected the highest mpi is achieved when adding a sensor or proxy measurement to an initially ungauged system lower left of each heatmap as the number of initial measurement locations rises and the system is saturated with data the mpi decreases thus mpi is under 5 for all situations where two sensors are already present in the system uppermost cell in each heatmap there are systematic differences between the three measurement locations adding a data source to the pond which is furthest upstream in the catchment has the lowest impact whereas a measurement in the outlet shaft which is furthest downstream increases the performance significantly more although sensor data delivers a higher mpi than proxy data at the outlet shaft proxy data generally provides a high improvement at the pond and in the basement again the surprising advantage of proxy data is linked to overfitting as described in the supporting information section s4 on average over all situations the median mpi from using additional proxy data is 5 8 whereas the median mpi from using additional sensor data is 10 1 by comparing proxy and sensor data on a case by case basis with each case representing an initial configuration of sensors and data and given calibration and validation events the mpi of proxy data is just over 70 that of sensor data from the same location median value 3 4 costs and benefits of noise in this section the impact of noise on the calibration value of proxy data is assessed both complex correlated noise and simple gaussian noise are assessed with the help of the synthetic proxy data presented in section 2 3 this analysis has an illustrative purpose and limits itself to two situations that have measurements at the pond and or in the basement these locations were selected because measurements at the outlet shaft are too redundant with the other two locations 3 4 1 situation 1 calibration with proxy data from pond only in the first situation a single measurement point at the pond is available at the pond the following possible data are considered none uncalibrated sensor data ideal proxy data proxy data with gaussian noise fig 9 a and proxy data with complex correlated noise fig 9b the situation with no data data series at pond none corresponds to the uncalibrated model simulations from which the lower benchmark was computed compared to the uncalibrated models models calibrated with ideal proxy data ideal 100 or with sensor data have higher performance and lower variability nevertheless variability is still high with a significant portion of models performing worse than the median uncalibrated model this variability has to do with parameter uncertainty and overfitting as discussed in relation to fig 7 overfitting is also the reason why models calibrated with ideal 100 have a higher mp 48 than those calibrated with sensor data 35 as explained in the supporting information section s4 the presence of gaussian noise does not seem to have a strong negative impact on the mp which hovers below 50 for all quality levels above gau 60 fig 10 a for gau 60 overall performance is lower closer to that of the uncalibrated models surprisingly it appears that overall performance is highest for gau 80 which could be linked to a reduction of the overfitting mentioned in the previous paragraph correlated errors fig 9b have a visible impact on model performance with the mp for cor 60 near 0 nevertheless the overall performance is improved by a reduction in variance as compared to the uncalibrated models as the quality of the proxy data increases the calibration performance increases as well although the change is slight and even cor 90 has a distinctly lower performance than ideal 100 further differences appear when distinguishing performance based on the event used for calibration a discussion of the differences is provided in the supporting information section s5 3 4 2 situation 2 calibration with proxy data from pond and basement the second situation is equivalent to the first except that the noisy proxy data from the pond are supplemented with ideal proxy data ideal 100 from the basement fig 10 the base case data series at pond none now corresponds to models calibrated only with ideal proxy data from the basement hence the improved performance relative to fig 9 considering that the performance with sensor data at the pond is now clearly better than the performance with ideal proxy data at the pond it now appears that the problem with overfitting which occurred in absence of other data sources fig 9 is resolved again the proxy data with gaussian noise are not systematically worse than the proxy data with no noise fig 10a although the variability is higher for all cases the mp is higher than if only calibrating with ideal trend like data from the basement the none base case even gau 60 for which the noise previously appeared to negatively affect the mp performs no worse than the other proxy data series with gaussian noise in contrast calibrating with trend like data with complex correlated noise decreases the mp as compared to the base case fig 10b even when the magnitude of noise is small cor 90 performance does seem to correlate positively with data quality but the relationship is weak the poorly performing models and increased variability for cor 80 and cor 90 are again linked to overfitting that occurs specifically when calibrating with events 2 and 4 which are the only events to lack flooding in the basement 4 discussion 4 1 significance of this work 4 1 1 importance and novelty no conventional sensor solution exists for measuring small scale surface flooding in urban areas even though such measurements are needed to ensure the reliability of models and thus the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures thanks to a unique case study this work sheds light on a new opportunity for urban pluvial flood model calibration with alternative data sources namely with proxy data automatically obtained from surveillance footage the aspect of automatic image analysis is particularly important for privacy reasons which are one of the main risks associated to smart urban water solutions moy de vitry et al 2019b while many studies have looked into the collection of flooding data from alternative sources including social media and drones few are known to have investigated the actual benefits that such data provides this work tackles that question specifically while at the same time differentiating between sensor placement and different data qualities 4 1 2 why overfitting was tolerated discrepancies between model and data which sometimes led to overfitting were observed in this study these discrepancies were tolerated even though they complicated the analysis and could have been resolved e g by optimizing model structure the presence of such discrepancies can be attributed to the realism of the case study which gives significant practical value to the findings in particular this rather unique approach reduces the risk of overestimating the value of trend like data as might occur when using simulated data viero 2018 4 2 could cameras replace sensors 4 2 1 error free proxy data are almost as useful as sensor data in this study ideal error free proxy data were used to calibrate a simple flash flood model and were found to improve validation performance of the model in a consistent manner this finding suggests that proxy measurements have the potential to satisfy the lack of monitoring data for urban pluvial flood model calibration other studies have come to comparable conclusions for other alternative data sources for example regarding the use of citizen science to calibrate hydrologic river models van meerveld et al 2017 or the use of binary sensors to calibrate an urban drainage model wani et al 2017 this study also found that the difference in value between sensor data and error free proxy data is smaller than might be expected in more than half of all the calibration situations analyzed proxy data provided at least 70 of the benefit of sensor data to take a more specific example calibrating with proxy data at all available locations provided a median performance that was only 4 5 poorer than when calibrating with sensor data at the same locations in situations where overfitting is a risk such as when calibrating with only one upstream measurement in a catchment the results point to the surprising conclusion that ideal proxy data can provide more robust models than sensor data this was explained by the fact that proxy based calibration is less opinionated as compared to calibration with sensor data and objective functions that favor perfect fitting of the model to measurement values 4 2 2 measurement noise is usually detrimental the proxy data that were automatically extracted from surveillance footage of the case study contained noise and although there are ways to reduce it it is unlikely that such noise can be completely resolved the errors are due to classification problems and changes in the flooding scene moy de vitry et al 2019a and they have a complex autocorrelation structure in the present study the effect of complex correlated noise was usually detrimental in the worst cases even the proxy data with the lowest level of noise cor 90 would give significantly lower performance than the ideal proxy data ideal 100 gaussian noise random noise with low autocorrelation in contrast to complex correlated noise had a vastly different effect on performance when calibrating with proxy data from the pond alone then only the highest noise level gau 60 provoked a clear reduction in performance compared to the ideal proxy data in the other cases performance was similar or even higher than the ideal proxy data compared to previous research that suggests that random noise in calibration data do not have a strong negative effect during calibration dotto et al 2014 we go a step further and suggest that some noise could even be beneficial in situations where model overfitting is a risk it follows that until complex correlated noise is kept below an acceptable threshold which remains to be defined proxy data obtained from surveillance footage should be used for calibration only with extreme care possible approaches for reducing errors have been outlined by moy de vitry et al 2019a until then proxy based calibration should be limited to the assimilation of proxy data with uncorrelated errors such as proxy measurements from uncalibrated conventional sensors data from uncalibrated sensors do have systematic errors but these do not affect the trend information contained in the data 4 3 outlook and future research 4 3 1 suitability of the spearman correlation for calibrating proxy data the hybrid spearman correlation used in this study was effective in fitting the swmm model to the shape of the proxy data even when a large amount of noise was present the use of the iou in cases where the proxy data were flat e g when no flooding occurred in the basement proved to be effective for calibration although future research could investigate whether there are better alternatives to the proposed solution there are situations in which calibration with the spearman correlation is difficult for flood event 3 which involves a very short and shallow flood in the basement calibrations were sometimes unsuccessful because they would stop at a local minimum it appears that such issues could be avoided by making the calibration stopping criteria more strict a strong downside of the spearman correlation for describing data quality is that it is not very telling of the noise structure as seen in the results two proxy measurements with the same spearman correlation can give very different results during calibration better characterization of the noise structure would possibly also allow for correlated errors in the measurement data to be accounted for 4 3 2 further experiments are necessary the floodx data sets are of unique value thanks to their provision of multiple flood events on which flood models can be calibrated and validated nevertheless they are limited due to the small size of the facility in this study the small catchment size meant that with three sensors redundancy was higher than what is expected in a real catchment with perhaps a thousand times more components this led to interdependence between measurement locations meaning that it was not completely possible to isolate the effect of measurement location from the effect of other measurements thus larger case studies should be considered in the future measurement location was found to have a strong influence on the value of the monitoring data which underlines the importance of research for identification of optimal sensor placement for monitoring campaigns vonach et al 2018 compared to reality the flooding events studied in this paper lacked rainfall runoff processes in cases where these processes need to be modelled they can introduce parameter uncertainty that might shift the need for monitoring data upstream therefore it is also important that future case studies include such rainfall runoff processes it is expected that these processes increase modelling complexity and uncertainty thereby increasing the need for data especially surface flooding data and the potential benefit of proxy measurements as this study focused only on proxy measurements for water level from cameras using the sofi method future studies should consider combining sofi proxy measurements with other data sources examples include flow velocity data from surveillance cameras leitão et al 2018 citizens le boursicaud et al 2016 and drones perks et al 2016 or water level information obtained from social media chaudhary et al 2019 4 3 3 implications for model calibration with alternative data sources in this study the identifiability of parameters was found to depend on measurement location data type and data quality for example proxy data from the pond was found to provide only limited information on parameters downstream in certain cases this led to the selection of extreme parameter values in future studies calibration parameters should be defined according to a sensitivity analysis based on the available measurement data alternatively parameters that remain undefined after calibration should be assigned a value based on prior knowledge while a bayesian approach may be applicable in certain cases the definition of appropriate likelihood functions may be difficult as in the case of proxy data the presence of complex correlated noise was found to be a critical factor influencing model calibration in this study since such noise might be expected in practice a method is needed to identify and screen erroneous data before calibration accurate characterization of noise structure is also necessary for effective bayesian parameter estimation wani et al 2019 the spearman correlation seems to be an insufficient indicator of quality in this regard a similar call was issued concerning erroneous crowd sourced data in hydrological modelling mazzoleni et al 2017 once the reliability of a data source has been assessed it can be used or rejected based on a threshold alternatively when calibrating with multiple sources of data the reliability of each source can be used to weigh its objective function so that information that is more reliable has more significance 5 conclusions the lack of overland flood monitoring data is a recognized issue in urban pluvial flood modelling but in most situations conventional sensor solutions are very impractical if not impossible to deploy alternative data sources like social media and surveillance cameras appeal as a novel and cost effective approach to the problem this study assessed the potential of proxy measurements such as could be obtained from surveillance footage by automatically tracking the evolution of the visible flood extent with computer vision data from five flood events were used to calibrate and validate a one dimensional dual drainage epa swmm model with different combinations of proxy and sensor data overall the results showed that ideal proxy data with no errors or with gaussian noise are almost as useful as sensor data however the complex correlated errors currently featured in camera sourced proxy measurements are detrimental and can completely cancel any benefits of the proxy data the use of multiple measurement locations for calibration is also important for model performance the main contributions of this study are an objective function based on the spearman rank correlation coefficient was proposed and demonstrated for calibrating with water level proxy data it worked in most cases but experienced difficulty with one very short and shallow flooding event the results confirmed that proxy data have a strong potential to improve a urban pluvial flood model s predictive performance for example models calibrated with three ideal proxy data series had a median performance of 90 that of a perfectly calibrated model however complex correlated noise reduces the utility of proxy data and can even be counter productive gaussian noise was generally unproblematic and was sometimes beneficial in making the model more robust inevitable discrepancies in the model and data for example due to modelling assumptions can be harmless if a sufficient number of measurements are available too few measurements can lead to overfitting in which case performance was sometimes improved when data contained gaussian noise the spearman correlation is not a sufficient indicator of the presence of complex correlated noise as opposed to random gaussian noise which is a critical factor for model calibration in practice alternative data sources such as surveillance cameras are not expected to provide perfect data so the issue of data quality assessment and screening should be investigated further code and data availability the code used in this work for creating training and evaluating the dcnn as well as

particular samples from a pilot scale membrane biological reactor mbr followed by nanofiltration nf advanced water treatment plant are used for the study concentrations of both specific ndma

of contamination but also water reuse is being popularized many studies have already confirmed the presence of unconventional contaminants in surface and wastewater and also those that can be generated during water treatment processes particularly n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which is classified as probable human carcinogens epa 2014 has been detected as emerging disinfection by product dbp in treated waters around the world bond et al 2011 krasner et al 2013 previous studies have shown that dimethlyamine dma could react with chloramines to generate ndma choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002 schreiber and mitch 2006 while others demonstrated that dissolved organic matter dom is also an important pool of ndma precursors sgroi et al 2018a b ndma is listed in the world health organization who drinking water guidelines at 100 ng l limit who 2011 and was also added to the contaminant candidate list 4 of the united states environment protection agency epa 2016 california s department of public health have established a 10 ng l cepa 2014 notification levels for ndma in drinking water while california s office of environmental health hazard assessment have defined 3 ng l as a public health goal 2006 limits have also been established in massachusetts dep 2004 and ontario omoe 2003 previous studies examined the mechanisms of ndma formation during chloramination the main mechanism of ndma formation involves a nucleophilic substitution reaction between an organic nitrogencompound containing the dimethylamino group and dichloramine mitch et al 2003b selbes et al 2013 others studies have also shown that ozone o3 is able to form ndma sgroi et al 2015 because formation of ndma can continue during distribution unless the precursors have been removed or transformed several studies have focused on ndma precursor removal by different water and wastewater processes wang et al 2013 showed that conventional processes could not completely control nitrosamines because the hydrophilic and low molecular weight dom were stronger nitrosamine precursors granular activated carbon gac and reverse osmosis ro are both effective treatments for ndma precursor removal while the efficiency of conventional biological process is limited sgroi et al 2018a b photolysis is the most employed mitigation strategy to control ndma but it is only partially effective at destruction of nitrosamines precursors krasner et al 2013 in this context to identify proxy indicators for ndma precursors and their removal would be helpful because ndma precursor analysis by employing formation potential fp tests is expensive and time consuming farré et al 2019 currently the methods widely used in water treatment system monitoring to evaluate the performance include parameters such as total organic carbon toc conductivity and in the case of membrane processes trans membrane pressure tmp particularly useful for monitoring natural and effluent organic matter are absorbance and fluorescence based parameters reckhow et al 1990 korshin et al 1997 świetlik and sikorska 2004 chow et al 2007 matilainen et al 2011 carstea et al 2016 fluorescence spectroscopy has been suggested as a potential monitoring tool given its high sensitivity and selectivity properties for instance fluorescence has been investigated as a monitoring tool for a range of applications including water quality and pollution monitoring in rivers hudson et al 2008a sgroi et al 2017a process control in conventional and advanced wastewater treatment processes murphy et al 2011 gerrity et al 2012 singh et al 2012

are obtained by combining fluorescence emission spectra measured from a series of different excitation wavelengths since a sub fraction of dissolved organic matter fluoresces when excited with ultraviolet light eem can be used to quantify and characterize changes in dissolved organic matter dom in aquatic environments because the concentration and chemical composition of dom influences the intensity and shape of the fluorescence spectra the interpretation of eems can be very difficult and several factors e g inner filter effect filtration static and dynamic quenching can affect the ensuing fluorescence data sgroi et al 2020a generally the approaches for characterizing eems have relied on identification of peaks and ratios of fluorescence in different regions of the spectrum e g coble 1996 mcknight et al 2001 the most applied techniques are fluorescence regional integration fri parallel factor analysis parafac and principal component analysis pca previous research has investigated the capability of eem to predict ndma fp for example hua and co authors sampled 56 lakes of missouri and investigated the correlation between eem and ndma fp hua et al 2007 and observed that waters with fluorescence center at excitation 290 310 nm emission 330 350 nm were related to high ndma fp yang and coauthors also investigated the correlation between ndma fp and parafac components and assessed the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring ndmafp in drinking water treatment plants yang et al 2015 they concluded that the tryptophan like component c3 showed a good correlation with ndma fp in natural source waters these studies were carried out using natural waters and or drinking water therefore the main objective of the present study is to evaluate the applicability of fluorescence measurements as online monitoring parameters for ndma precursors for water reuse applications throughout a pilot scale advanced wastewater treatment train which included a membrane biological reactor mbr followed by nanofiltration nf the samples used for the study were mbr influent mbr effluent nf feed and nf permeate also the effluent from the conventional full scale

detail in mamo et al 2016 the main parameters to describe the mbr and the nf process are summarized in the table si2 and table si3 of the supporting information 2 3 sample collection sampling was carried out during dry weather flow to avoid the dilution of influent due to a combined sewer system in the city fig 1 shows a scheme of the pilot plant and the sampling points 24 hour composite

2 μm microfiber filter followed by a 0 45 μm nylon membrane filter and stored at 4 c during transportation before being frozen composite samples were taken using an auto sampler which drew a sample every hour over a 24 h period 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 ndma formation potential test and ndma measurement total ndma precursors were quantified by first carrying out an ndma formation potential fp test on the water samples and then analyzing the generated ndma by spme followed by gas chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer gc qqq for the ndma fp test the protocol

minimize interference park and snyder 2018 sgroi et al 2020b fluorescence data were recorded using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer the spectrometer employed a xenon excitation source and the slit widths of excitation and emission were set at 5 nm the eem were collected with corresponding scanning emission em spectra from 250 to 580 nm at 5 nm increments by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 220 to 450 nm at 5 nm sampling intervals the voltage was maintained at 700 v and the scanning speed was set at 2400 nm min the raman scatter effect was minimized by subtracting eems of pure milli q water from the sample eems any negative intensity values produced by this subtraction were converted to zero values then the emission intensity data were normalized to the raman peak area of an emission wavelengths scan of milli q water samples collected at the interval of 1 nm and related to an excitation wavelength of 350 nm to produce fluorescence intensities in raman unit ru non trilinear data related to the rayleigh scattering were eliminated murphy et al 2010 finally inner filter effect correction was accomplished according to the methodology proposed in literature lakowicz 2006 sgroi et al 2020b from the collected fluorescence eem several peaks were derived they reflect the occurrence of specific fluorophores in dom of collected wastewater samples in particular fluorescence regional integration fri was performed according to published literature chen et al 2003 sgroi et al 2017a to calculate the total and regional fluorescence intensities for each sample integration was based on five regions representing i aromatic proteins tyrosine like substances ii aromatic proteins tryptophan like substances iii fulvic like and humic like substances iv microbial byproducts proteins tryptophan like substances and biopolymers and v humic like substances these regions embrace fluorescence eem peaks typical of wastewater matrices chen et al 2003 sgroi et al 2017a fluorescence dom components obtained by fluorescence regional integration of region i ii iii iv and v were denoted as φ1 φ2 φ3 φ4 and φ5 respectively total fluorescence calculated integrating the

al 2012 2013 and on the potential to generate ndma schmidt et al 2006 shen and andrews 2011 a list of specific ndma precursors was created consisting of tetracycline roxithromycin spiramycin chlorotetracycline doxycycline oxytetracycline erythromycin azithromycin clarithromycin tylosin venlafaxine including its metabolite o desmethylvenlafaxine ranitidine and citalopram farré et al 2016 only seven compounds were detected in the study among the fourteen investigated compounds these were erythromycin azithromycin clarithromycin venlafaxine o desmethylvenlafaxine ranitidine and citalopram except ranitidine the remaining identified precursors have a yield of ndma formation below 10 farré et al 2016 shen and andrews 2011 correlation between the concentration of individual ndma precursors detected at the different sampling points and ndma fp was investigated results plotted in fig 2 and figure si1 correspond to the averaged values of the concentrations measured at the six sampling locations consisting of mbr influent mbr effluent nf influent nf permeate ro concentrate and full scale plant effluent as seen in fig 2 some precursors correlated well with the bulk measurement of ndma fp for example the spearman rank coefficient rs value between the concentration of ranitidine which has a high yield of ndma conversion shen and andrews 2011 and ndma fp was rs 0 83 p 0 05 the other compounds showing a positive correlation were azithromycin rs 0 89 p 0 03 erythromycin rs 0 89 p 0 03 and o desmethylvenlafaxine rs 0 94 p 0 01 there was no statistically significant correlation between the remaining specific precursors with lower yield of conversion and ndma fp p 0 1 see figure si1 in a previous study farré et al 2016 concluded that only 2 6 of ndma fp could be explained by the compounds selected but in particular ranitidine was responsible of more than 75 of the identified percentage therefore it is not surprising that a good correlation exists between this compound and the bulk ndma fp measurement zeng and mitch 2015 also found a high association between the concentration of ndma and the presence of the pharmaceutical ranitidine when investigating the contribution of different grey and blackwaters to the formation of ndma during wastewater reuse applications 3 2 correlation between individual ndma precursors and dom fluorescence in this study the correlation between individual ndma precursors and fluorescence peaks were also explored in this case data was normally distributed and therefore the determination coefficient r2 value was used to check correlations statistics showing the normality of the data are included in the supporting information table si4 it was observed that the fluorescence peak i4 shows the best correlation r2 0 8 with specific ndma precursors such as azithromycin o desmethylvenlafaxine clarithromycin and ranitidine fig 3 and figure si2 fig 3 shows such correlation for averaged values of ranitidine r2 0 93 p 0 001 clarithromycin r2 0 99 p 0 00007 azithromycin r2 0 84 p 0 01 and o desmethylvenlafaxine r2 0 93 p 0 002 obtained from the six sampling points throughout the mbr nf pilot plant the determination coefficient values for the remaining compounds is shown in figure si2 it is noteworthy to mention that i4 is a protein like peak see also table si5 that is referred also as tryptophan like and soluble microbial by product like component chen et al 2003 coble et al 2014 carstea et al 2016 sgroi et al 2017a 2017b a prior study yang et al 2015 showed that tryptophan like component located in the soluble microbial by product like region correlated with ndma fp in drinking water treatment plants yang et al 2015 although no individual compounds were studied on the other hand ma and co authors ma et al 2016 found no quantitative correlation between eem volume of protein like region located in the soluble microbial by product like region and ndma formation when also investigating n dbp formation and quantification by eem in mbr treated municipal water results obtained in this study highlight that dom fluorescence may be used to monitor the fate of pharmaceuticals that are specific ndma precursor throughout advanced membrane treatment processes this result adds to the literature on the use of fluorescence to monitor emerging trace organic chemical in advanced treatment processes e g adsorption advanced oxidation processes for wastewater reclamation and reuse gerrity et al 2012 park et al 2017 sgroi et al 2018b 3 3 removal of ndma precursors and fluorescing organic matter by mbr the removal of ndma fp through the mbr was investigated and correlated to the removal of different fluorescence peaks fig 4 shows the percentage of removal of the individual compounds as well as the percentage of bulk removal of ndma precursors measured by the fp test the median percentage of removal was 66 20 85 57 64 74 and 35 for azithromycin citalopram clarithromycin erythromycin o desmethylvenlafaxine ranitidine and venlafaxine respectively the removal of ndma fp ranged between 72 and 97 as seen the percentage of removal varied greatly for all the detected compounds the reason for that variation is probably due to the fact that the nitrification conditions in the mbr were forced with the objective of investigating if the removal of ndma precursors was dependent on the aerobic anaerobic conditions of the mbr batt et al 2006 mamo et al 2016 tran et al 2009 it was observed that conditions favouring nitrification also favour the removal of both specific precursors as well as ndma fp and the results are described in detail in mamo et al 2016 in a previous work investigating the relation of the different eem regions with ndma formation potential we found that the fluorescence region of the eem associated with aromatic proteins and tyrosine like substances was correlated with the ndma precursors finocchiaro et al 2017 hence we further investigated the correlation between the removal of eem signals with the removal of ndma precursors across the mbr pilot plant median values corresponding to the removal of fluorescence dom components obtained by fluorescence regional integration of region i ii iii iv and v were 87 75 43 75 20 and 73 for φ1 φ2 φ3 φ4 φ5 and φt respectively fig 5 a as seen in fig 5a the variability of the removal of each of the regions as well as φt was large in agreement with the variability of the removal of the individual pharmaceuticals compounds presented earlier and as a result of the changing conditions of aeration of the mbr additionally the removal of fluorescence peaks developed based on the peak picking method named as i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 was also investigated and plotted in fig 5b the observed maximum fluorescence intensity in each of the five regions aforementioned i e i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 are located at excitation emission pairs similar to those reported by sgroi et al 2017b i1 225 290 nm i2 225 340 i3 245 440 i4 275 345 and i5 345 440 these excitation emission pairs represent typical eem features to compound classes relevant to effluent organic matter efom similarly to the data obtained by fluorescence regional integration median values corresponding to the removal of i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 were 87 83 25 81 and 13 respectively again the observed ranges of variability may be interpreted as the effect of the changing conditions of the mbr however it is noteworthy that the removal percentage of each eem peaks is very similar to those observed in a prior study sgroi et al 2017b that investigated the eem removal in several conventional secondary wwtps of different sizes indeed sgroi et al 2017b observed that the average removal of eem peak was 87 82 32 73 and 30 for i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 respectively this means that both the conventional biological process employed at the wwtps and the pilot mbr degrade the protein like peaks much better than the humic or fulvic like peaks it seems that the removal of humic and fulvic like material by mbr is better than that observed for conventional activated sludge systems but this require further investigation 3 4 removal of ndma precursors and fluorescing organic matter by nf the effluent of the mbr was fed to the nanofiltration nf membrane system to achieve higher quality suitable for water reuse fig 6 represents the removal of individual pharmaceuticals and whole ndma fp precursors through the nf membrane as expected the removal of all the individual compounds was higher than that observed at the mbr process in particular the removal of those pharmaceuticals selected as ndma precursors was always above 90 independently of the conditions changed in the mbr the removal of φ1 φ2 φ3 φ4 and φ5 as well as i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 through the nf membrane was also investigated as seen in fig 7 the removal percentage of the fluorescence peaks was above 90 with low variations in agreement with the results of the percentage removal reported in fig 6 which represented the removal of specific ndma precursors e g selected pharmaceuticals an exception can be observed for φ1 and i1 for which larger variations of the removal percentage were observed linlin and co authors 2011 evaluated the removal of eem signal of dom and showed that nf removes aromatic humic acid like and fulvic acid like substances efficiently and specially removes dom with mw above 1 0 kda the high removal percentage generated by the nf membranes added data points to examine the correlations between percentage of removal of specific ndma precursors and ndma fp with eem signals these correlations are presented in the following sections 3 5 relationships between ndma precursors and fluorescing organic matter the range of the different aeration conditions investigated in mamo et al 2016 generated a complete set of data that allowed the examination of the correlations between percentage of removal of ndma precursors and the fluorescence indexes during the mbr process correlation of the ndma fp with the different fluorescence peaks obtained by the peak picking method named as i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 was investigated it is noteworthy to mention that the five peaks found in this study are typical of dom fluorescence from municipal wastewaters murphy et al 2011 coble et al 2014 carstea et al 2016 sgroi et al 2017a 2017b as shown in table si5 that compare the peaks detected in prior research the correlation between the removal of the fluorescence peaks i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 and the removal of ndma precursors through the mbr process are presented in table 1 the peaks that had better correlation with ndma fp were i1 i2 which correspond to aromatic proteins and tyrosine like substances these were also removed at high percentage i e 87 and 83 median values respectively during the mbr process while i3 and i5 were removed at 25 and 13 respectively fig 4 wang and coauthors 2017 also showed that mbr technology was efficient to remove protein and soluble microbial byproduct like materials region iv when investigating the nitrogen removal mechanism during wastewater reclamation plant on the other hand fulvic acid like substances region iii and humic acid like region v substances seem to be more difficult to remove by the microorganisms he et al 2011 hudson et al 2008a the observed correlation between the removal of ndma precursors and the removal of protein like material by the mbr reactor is also corroborated by the data obtained from the mbr nf pilot system table 2 shows the regression equations and the related determination coefficients obtained by the correlations between the concentration of ndma precursors vs the corresponding fluorescence peaks i1 i2 i3 i4 or i5 obtained from the samples collected at the different stage of the mbr nf pilot train over the four months sampling campaign in this case the determination coefficients for i1 and i2 are lower than of those observed for the data presented in table 1 while are higher for i4 furthermore a very high correlation r2 0 89 p 0 004 and rs 1 p 0 002 for the three correlations was found between the averaged ndma fp concentrations obtained at each of the six sampling points across the mbr nf treatment plants and the fluorescent peaks i1 i2 and i4 fig 8 figure si3 shows the lack of correlation between i3 i5 and the ndma fp yang et al 2015 interpreted the correlation between the c3 component of parafac tryptophan like component and ndma fp because of the close association of the composition of ndma precursors with proteins rich in nitrogen even though they analyzed waters collected at drinking water treatment plants they highlighted that the investigated source water may be impacted by effluents from wastewater treatment plants in this study the occurrence of protein like peaks is more relevant because the experiments were carried out by using raw and treated wastewater therefore the results obtained in this study are relevant and demonstrate the relationships between ndma precursors and protein like material measured by fluorescence eem indeed although water quality parameters such as ph temperature salinity carbohydrate protein interactions may affect the dom fluorescence senesi 1990 lee 1997 spencer et al 2007 the presented data demonstrate that the selected fluorescence peaks can be used to track the fate of the ndma precursors at varying wastewater quality throughout a membrane based advanced treatment processes this result corroborates prior research that highlights that dom fluorescence can be used to monitor wastewater quality in different full scale wastewater treatment plants murphy et al 2011 sgroi et al 2017b such correlation between dom fluorescence and wastewater quality are usually observed for municipal wastewater at typical environmental conditions but may not be valid for other wastewater furthermore the use of the i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 peaks that are defined as the maximum fluorescence intensity recorded in each of the five typical eem regions chen et al 2003 sgroi et al 2017a 2017b could also help to catch the peak regardless of any spectral shift due to a change in water quality e g ph overall the correlations observed between the ndma fp and the fluorescence peaks i1 i2 and i4 during the mbr process and during the complete pilot treatment train mbr nf highlight that the fate of ndma precursors throughout the membrane based advanced treatment process can be tracked by monitoring the protein like peaks of dom fluorescence 4 conclusions in this study the fate of ndma precursors and dom fluorescence was tracked throughout a pilot scale mbr nf wastewater treatment plants furthermore very strong correlations were found between ndma precursors concentrations and the fluorescence of protein like material sampled at different stage of the mbr nf system based on the results of the study the following conclusions can be drawn removal of pharmaceuticals selected as ndma precursors during the mbr process was compound specific while the removal of the whole ndma precursors ndma fp was higher than such pharmaceuticals mbr removes the protein like peaks of dom fluorescence better than the fulvic and humic like peaks the removal of ndma precursors and of dom fluorescence peaks by nf was higher than 90 and 95 respectively median values strong correlations were found between the averaged concentrations of selected ndma precursors i e ranitidine azithromycin erythromycin o desmethylvenlafaxine and ndma fp throughout the mbr nf pilot system the removal of ndma fp was correlated with the removal of fluorescence peaks that represent protein like materials i1 i2 and i4 during the mbr process r2 0 64 a very strong correlation r2 0 89 was also found between the averaged concentrations of ndma fp and the fluorescence peaks i1 i2 and i4 observed throughout the mbr nf pilot plant the aforementioned results highlight that protein like peaks of fluorescence dom of wastewater can be used to monitor the fate of ndma precursors including specific pharmaceuticals and the whole group of precursors in membrane base advanced treatment

18026,this study investigates the potential of fluorescence excitation emission matrices eem measurement as a tool to predict n nitrosodimethylamine ndma formation in water reuse applications in particular samples from a pilot scale membrane biological reactor mbr followed by nanofiltration nf advanced water treatment plant are used for the study concentrations of both specific ndma precursors and ndma formation potential fp are correlated with different eem peaks the specific precursors investigated are erythromycin azithromycin clarithromycin venlafaxine o desmethylvenlafaxine ranitidine and citalopram while the ndma fp is conventionally measured by the ndma formation potential test eem peaks investigated are obtained by fluorescence regional integration as well as by the peak picking method generating i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 peaks results showed that protein like materials are correlated with the bulk ndma fp and specific ndma precursors additionally selected fluorescence peaks such as i1 i2 and i4 are strongly correlated with ndma precursors throughout the mbr nf pilot plant the removal of ndma precursors and eem peaks also correlated well r2 0 8 this data shows that fluorescence eem can be a promising tool to monitor the concentration of ndma precursors and their removal in water reuse application graphical abstract image 1 keywords n nitrosodimethylamine pharmaceuticals fluorescence excitation emission matrix mbr nf disinfection by products 1 introduction over the last decades water bodies are becoming stressed with higher and more diversified loads of contamination but also water reuse is being popularized many studies have already confirmed the presence of unconventional contaminants in surface and wastewater and also those that can be generated during water treatment processes particularly n nitrosodimethylamine ndma which is classified as probable human carcinogens epa 2014 has been detected as emerging disinfection by product dbp in treated waters around the world bond et al 2011 krasner et al 2013 previous studies have shown that dimethlyamine dma could react with chloramines to generate ndma choi and valentine 2002 mitch and sedlak 2002 schreiber and mitch 2006 while others demonstrated that dissolved organic matter dom is also an important pool of ndma precursors sgroi et al 2018a b ndma is listed in the world health organization who drinking water guidelines at 100 ng l limit who 2011 and was also added to the contaminant candidate list 4 of the united states environment protection agency epa 2016 california s department of public health have established a 10 ng l cepa 2014 notification levels for ndma in drinking water while california s office of environmental health hazard assessment have defined 3 ng l as a public health goal 2006 limits have also been established in massachusetts dep 2004 and ontario omoe 2003 previous studies examined the mechanisms of ndma formation during chloramination the main mechanism of ndma formation involves a nucleophilic substitution reaction between an organic nitrogencompound containing the dimethylamino group and dichloramine mitch et al 2003b selbes et al 2013 others studies have also shown that ozone o3 is able to form ndma sgroi et al 2015 because formation of ndma can continue during distribution unless the precursors have been removed or transformed several studies have focused on ndma precursor removal by different water and wastewater processes wang et al 2013 showed that conventional processes could not completely control nitrosamines because the hydrophilic and low molecular weight dom were stronger nitrosamine precursors granular activated carbon gac and reverse osmosis ro are both effective treatments for ndma precursor removal while the efficiency of conventional biological process is limited sgroi et al 2018a b photolysis is the most employed mitigation strategy to control ndma but it is only partially effective at destruction of nitrosamines precursors krasner et al 2013 in this context to identify proxy indicators for ndma precursors and their removal would be helpful because ndma precursor analysis by employing formation potential fp tests is expensive and time consuming farré et al 2019 currently the methods widely used in water treatment system monitoring to evaluate the performance include parameters such as total organic carbon toc conductivity and in the case of membrane processes trans membrane pressure tmp particularly useful for monitoring natural and effluent organic matter are absorbance and fluorescence based parameters reckhow et al 1990 korshin et al 1997 świetlik and sikorska 2004 chow et al 2007 matilainen et al 2011 carstea et al 2016 fluorescence spectroscopy has been suggested as a potential monitoring tool given its high sensitivity and selectivity properties for instance fluorescence has been investigated as a monitoring tool for a range of applications including water quality and pollution monitoring in rivers hudson et al 2008a sgroi et al 2017a process control in conventional and advanced wastewater treatment processes murphy et al 2011 gerrity et al 2012 singh et al 2012 2015 park et al 2017 sgroi et al 2017b 2018b and disinfection byproduct dbp in drinking water treatment hua et al 2007 roccaro et al 2009 roccaro and vagliasindi 2010 excitation emission matrix eems are obtained by combining fluorescence emission spectra measured from a series of different excitation wavelengths since a sub fraction of dissolved organic matter fluoresces when excited with ultraviolet light eem can be used to quantify and characterize changes in dissolved organic matter dom in aquatic environments because the concentration and chemical composition of dom influences the intensity and shape of the fluorescence spectra the interpretation of eems can be very difficult and several factors e g inner filter effect filtration static and dynamic quenching can affect the ensuing fluorescence data sgroi et al 2020a generally the approaches for characterizing eems have relied on identification of peaks and ratios of fluorescence in different regions of the spectrum e g coble 1996 mcknight et al 2001 the most applied techniques are fluorescence regional integration fri parallel factor analysis parafac and principal component analysis pca previous research has investigated the capability of eem to predict ndma fp for example hua and co authors sampled 56 lakes of missouri and investigated the correlation between eem and ndma fp hua et al 2007 and observed that waters with fluorescence center at excitation 290 310 nm emission 330 350 nm were related to high ndma fp yang and coauthors also investigated the correlation between ndma fp and parafac components and assessed the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring ndmafp in drinking water treatment plants yang et al 2015 they concluded that the tryptophan like component c3 showed a good correlation with ndma fp in natural source waters these studies were carried out using natural waters and or drinking water therefore the main objective of the present study is to evaluate the applicability of fluorescence measurements as online monitoring parameters for ndma precursors for water reuse applications throughout a pilot scale advanced wastewater treatment train which included a membrane biological reactor mbr followed by nanofiltration nf the samples used for the study were mbr influent mbr effluent nf feed and nf permeate also the effluent from the conventional full scale plant was used all the samples were collected during 4 months at varying operating conditions of the pilot plant this paper builds upon a previous study where the removal of ndma precursors dependence on the aeration conditions of the mbr was investigated mamo et al 2016 the measurement of eem and uv of the samples taken in the mamo et al study mamo et al 2016 allowed us to investigate the possibility to use fluorescence to predict ndma precursors 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ndma 5000 μg ml in methanol had a purity of 99 9 and was obtained from supelco deuterated ndma d6 was

methodologies gros et al 2012 2013 more details about the chemical preparation can be found in the supporting information text 1 2 2 wastewater used and pilot treatment plant employed the mbr ro nf pilot plant was installed at the full scale wwtp of quart girona ne spain and thus treating real wastewater with a capacity of 3 4 m3 day the plant shown in fig 1 consists of pre screening followed by primary settling equalization and a bioreactor having a total volume of 2 26 m3 divided into four compartments according to the uct configuration for nutrient removal as described by monclús et al monclús 2010 the submerged flat sheet membrane from kubota had a total surface area of 8 m2 and a pore size of 0 4 μm the operating conditions of the mbr system and the ro system can be found in detail in mamo et al 2016 the main parameters to describe the mbr and the nf process are summarized in the table si2 and table si3 of the supporting information 2 3 sample collection sampling was carried out during dry weather flow to avoid the dilution of influent due to a combined sewer system in the city fig 1 shows a scheme of the pilot plant and the sampling points 24 hour composite samples were taken for the mbr influent mbr effluent while grab samples were taken for the nf feed nf permeate and nf concentrate additional samples were taken from the effluent of the full scale plant overall six sampling points were employed within sixteen sampling events for four months wastewater samples were collected in pre rinsed 1 l pet bottles samples were filtered on site through a 1 2 μm microfiber filter followed by a 0 45 μm nylon membrane filter and stored at 4 c during transportation before being frozen composite samples were taken using an auto sampler which drew a sample every hour over a 24 h period 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 ndma formation potential test and ndma measurement total ndma precursors were quantified by first carrying out an ndma formation potential fp test on the water samples and then analyzing the generated ndma by spme followed by gas chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer gc qqq for the ndma fp test the protocol published by mitch et al 2003a was followed briefly 140 mg l chloramine prepared at ph 8 was added to a 10 mm phosphate buffered filtered sample during the fp test samples were stored in the dark and at ambient conditions t 21 1 c for 7 days after this time chloramines were quenched with 2 5 g l of sodium sulfite the procedure for ndma analysis was modified from the headspace method proposed by grebel et al 2006 and is described in detail in the supporting information text 2 gc qqq analysis was performed by a trace gc ultra thermo fisher gas chromatograph equipped with a triplustm

phenomenex more details on this analysis can be found in the supporting information text 3 2 4 3 fluorescence analysis samples were filtered and conserved according to prior research in order to minimize interference park and snyder 2018 sgroi et al 2020b fluorescence data were recorded using a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer the spectrometer employed a xenon excitation source and the slit widths of excitation and emission were set at 5 nm the eem were collected with corresponding scanning emission em spectra from 250 to 580 nm at 5 nm increments by varying the excitation ex wavelength from 220 to 450 nm at 5 nm sampling intervals the voltage was maintained at 700 v and the scanning speed was set at 2400 nm min the raman scatter effect was minimized by subtracting eems of pure milli q water from the sample eems any negative intensity values produced by this subtraction were converted to zero values then the emission intensity data were normalized to the raman peak area of an emission wavelengths scan of milli q water samples collected at the interval of 1 nm and related to an excitation wavelength of 350 nm to produce fluorescence intensities in raman unit ru non trilinear data related to the rayleigh scattering were eliminated murphy et al 2010 finally inner filter effect correction was accomplished according to the methodology proposed in literature lakowicz 2006 sgroi et al 2020b from the collected fluorescence eem several peaks were derived they reflect the occurrence of specific fluorophores in dom of collected wastewater samples in particular fluorescence regional integration fri was performed according to published literature chen et al 2003 sgroi et al 2017a to calculate the total and regional fluorescence intensities for each sample integration was based on five regions representing i aromatic proteins tyrosine like substances ii aromatic proteins tryptophan like substances iii fulvic like and humic like substances iv microbial byproducts proteins tryptophan like substances and biopolymers and v humic like substances these regions embrace fluorescence eem peaks typical of wastewater matrices chen et al 2003 sgroi et al 2017a fluorescence dom components obtained by fluorescence regional integration of region i ii iii iv and v were denoted as φ1 φ2 φ3 φ4 and φ5 respectively total fluorescence calculated integrating the volume under the whole eem surface was denoted as φt chen et al 2003 fluorescence peaks developed based on the peak picking method were also selected in particular specific excitation emission pairs that correspond to the maximum fluorescence intensity in each of the five regions aforementioned were recorded and referred as i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 sgroi et al 2017a 2017b 2 4 4 other analyses samples

al 2012 2013 and on the potential to generate ndma schmidt et al 2006 shen and andrews 2011 a list of specific ndma precursors was created consisting of tetracycline roxithromycin spiramycin chlorotetracycline doxycycline oxytetracycline erythromycin azithromycin clarithromycin tylosin venlafaxine including its metabolite o desmethylvenlafaxine ranitidine and citalopram farré et al 2016 only seven compounds were detected in the study among the fourteen investigated compounds these were erythromycin azithromycin clarithromycin venlafaxine o desmethylvenlafaxine ranitidine and citalopram except ranitidine the remaining identified precursors have a yield of ndma formation below 10 farré et al 2016 shen and andrews 2011 correlation between the concentration of individual ndma precursors detected at the different sampling points and ndma fp was investigated results plotted in fig 2 and figure si1 correspond to the averaged values of the concentrations measured at the six sampling locations consisting of mbr influent mbr effluent nf influent nf permeate ro concentrate and full scale plant effluent as seen in fig 2 some precursors correlated well with the bulk measurement of ndma fp for example the spearman rank coefficient rs value between the concentration of ranitidine which has a high yield of ndma conversion shen and andrews 2011 and ndma fp was rs 0 83 p 0 05 the other compounds showing a positive correlation were azithromycin rs 0 89 p 0 03 erythromycin rs 0 89 p 0 03 and o desmethylvenlafaxine rs 0 94 p 0 01 there was no statistically significant correlation between the remaining specific precursors with lower yield of conversion and ndma fp p 0 1 see figure si1 in a previous study farré et al 2016 concluded that only 2 6 of ndma fp could be explained by the compounds selected but in particular ranitidine was responsible of more than 75 of the identified percentage therefore it is not surprising that a good correlation exists between this compound and the bulk ndma fp measurement zeng and mitch 2015 also found a high association between the concentration of ndma and the presence of the pharmaceutical ranitidine when investigating the contribution of different grey and blackwaters to the formation of ndma during wastewater reuse applications 3 2 correlation between individual ndma precursors and dom fluorescence in this study the correlation between individual ndma precursors and fluorescence peaks were also explored in this case data was normally distributed and therefore the determination coefficient r2 value was used to check correlations statistics showing the normality of the data are included in the supporting information table si4 it was observed that the fluorescence peak i4 shows the best correlation r2 0 8 with specific ndma precursors such as azithromycin o desmethylvenlafaxine clarithromycin and ranitidine fig 3 and figure si2 fig 3 shows such correlation for averaged values of ranitidine r2 0 93 p 0 001 clarithromycin r2 0 99 p 0 00007 azithromycin r2 0 84 p 0 01 and o desmethylvenlafaxine r2 0 93 p 0 002 obtained from the six sampling points throughout the mbr nf pilot plant the determination coefficient values for the remaining compounds is shown in figure si2 it is noteworthy to mention that i4 is a protein like peak see also table si5 that is referred also as tryptophan like and soluble microbial by product like component chen et al 2003 coble et al 2014 carstea et al 2016 sgroi et al 2017a 2017b a prior study yang et al 2015 showed that tryptophan like component located in the soluble microbial by product like region correlated with ndma fp in drinking water treatment plants yang et al 2015 although no individual compounds were studied on the other hand ma and co authors ma et al 2016 found no quantitative correlation between eem volume of protein like region located in the soluble microbial by product like region and ndma formation when also investigating n dbp formation and quantification by eem in mbr treated municipal water results obtained in this study highlight that dom fluorescence may be used to monitor the fate of pharmaceuticals that are specific ndma precursor throughout advanced membrane treatment processes this result adds to the literature on the use of fluorescence to monitor emerging trace organic chemical in advanced treatment processes e g adsorption advanced oxidation processes for wastewater reclamation and reuse gerrity et al 2012 park et al 2017 sgroi et al 2018b 3 3 removal of ndma precursors and fluorescing organic matter by mbr the removal of ndma fp through the mbr was investigated and correlated to the removal of different fluorescence peaks fig 4 shows the percentage of removal of the individual compounds as well as the percentage of bulk removal of ndma precursors measured by the fp test the median percentage of removal was 66 20 85 57 64 74 and 35 for azithromycin citalopram clarithromycin erythromycin o desmethylvenlafaxine ranitidine and venlafaxine respectively the removal of ndma fp ranged between 72 and 97 as seen the percentage of removal varied greatly for all the detected compounds the reason for that variation is probably due to the fact that the nitrification conditions in the mbr were forced with the objective of investigating if the removal of ndma precursors was dependent on the aerobic anaerobic conditions of the mbr batt et al 2006 mamo et al 2016 tran et al 2009 it was observed that conditions favouring nitrification also favour the removal of both specific precursors as well as ndma fp and the results are described in detail in mamo et al 2016 in a previous work investigating the relation of the different eem regions with ndma formation potential we found that the fluorescence region of the eem associated with aromatic proteins and tyrosine like substances was correlated with the ndma precursors finocchiaro et al 2017 hence we further investigated the correlation between the removal of eem signals with the removal of ndma precursors across the mbr pilot plant median values corresponding to the removal of fluorescence dom components obtained by fluorescence regional integration of region i ii iii iv and v were 87 75 43 75 20 and 73 for φ1 φ2 φ3 φ4 φ5 and φt respectively fig 5 a as seen in fig 5a the variability of the removal of each of the regions as well as φt was large in agreement with the variability of the removal of the individual pharmaceuticals compounds presented earlier and as a result of the changing conditions of aeration of the mbr additionally the removal of fluorescence peaks developed based on the peak picking method named as i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 was also investigated and plotted in fig 5b the observed maximum fluorescence intensity in each of the five regions aforementioned i e i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 are located at excitation emission pairs similar to those reported by sgroi et al 2017b i1 225 290 nm i2 225 340 i3 245 440 i4 275 345 and i5 345 440 these excitation emission pairs represent typical eem features to compound classes relevant to effluent organic matter efom similarly to the data obtained by fluorescence regional integration median values corresponding to the removal of i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 were 87 83 25 81 and 13 respectively again the observed ranges of variability may be interpreted as the effect of the changing conditions of the mbr however it is noteworthy that the removal percentage of each eem peaks is very similar to those observed in a prior study sgroi et al 2017b that investigated the eem removal in several conventional secondary wwtps of different sizes indeed sgroi et al 2017b observed that the average removal of eem peak was 87 82 32 73 and 30 for i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 respectively this means that both the conventional biological process employed at the wwtps and the pilot mbr degrade the protein like peaks much better than the humic or fulvic like peaks it seems that the removal of humic and fulvic like material by mbr is better than that observed for conventional activated sludge systems but this require further investigation 3 4 removal of ndma precursors and fluorescing organic matter by nf the effluent of the mbr was fed to the nanofiltration nf membrane system to achieve higher quality suitable for water reuse fig 6 represents the removal of individual pharmaceuticals and whole ndma fp precursors through the nf membrane as expected the removal of all the individual compounds was higher than that observed at the mbr process in particular the removal of those pharmaceuticals selected as ndma precursors was always above 90 independently of the conditions changed in the mbr the removal of φ1 φ2 φ3 φ4 and φ5 as well as i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 through the nf membrane was also investigated as seen in fig 7 the removal percentage of the fluorescence peaks was above 90 with low variations in agreement with the results of the percentage removal reported in fig 6 which represented the removal of specific ndma precursors e g selected pharmaceuticals an exception can be observed for φ1 and i1 for which larger variations of the removal percentage were observed linlin and co authors 2011 evaluated the removal of eem signal of dom and showed that nf removes aromatic humic acid like and fulvic acid like substances efficiently and specially removes dom with mw above 1 0 kda the high removal percentage generated by the nf membranes added data points to examine the correlations between percentage of removal of specific ndma precursors and ndma fp with eem signals these correlations are presented in the following sections 3 5 relationships between ndma precursors and fluorescing organic matter the range of the different aeration conditions investigated in mamo et al 2016 generated a complete set of data that allowed the examination of the correlations between percentage of removal of ndma precursors and the fluorescence indexes during the mbr process correlation of the ndma fp with the different fluorescence peaks obtained by the peak picking method named as i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 was investigated it is noteworthy to mention that the five peaks found in this study are typical of dom fluorescence from municipal wastewaters murphy et al 2011 coble et al 2014 carstea et al 2016 sgroi et al 2017a 2017b as shown in table si5 that compare the peaks detected in prior research the correlation between the removal of the fluorescence peaks i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 and the removal of ndma precursors through the mbr process are presented in table 1 the peaks that had better correlation with ndma fp were i1 i2 which correspond to aromatic proteins and tyrosine like substances these were also removed at high percentage i e 87 and 83 median values respectively during the mbr process while i3 and i5 were removed at 25 and 13 respectively fig 4 wang and coauthors 2017 also showed that mbr technology was efficient to remove protein and soluble microbial byproduct like materials region iv when investigating the nitrogen removal mechanism during wastewater reclamation plant on the other hand fulvic acid like substances region iii and humic acid like region v substances seem to be more difficult to remove by the microorganisms he et al 2011 hudson et al 2008a the observed correlation between the removal of ndma precursors and the removal of protein like material by the mbr reactor is also corroborated by the data obtained from the mbr nf pilot system table 2 shows the regression equations and the related determination coefficients obtained by the correlations between the concentration of ndma precursors vs the corresponding fluorescence peaks i1 i2 i3 i4 or i5 obtained from the samples collected at the different stage of the mbr nf pilot train over the four months sampling campaign in this case the determination coefficients for i1 and i2 are lower than of those observed for the data presented in table 1 while are higher for i4 furthermore a very high correlation r2 0 89 p 0 004 and rs 1 p 0 002 for the three correlations was found between the averaged ndma fp concentrations obtained at each of the six sampling points across the mbr nf treatment plants and the fluorescent peaks i1 i2 and i4 fig 8 figure si3 shows the lack of correlation between i3 i5 and the ndma fp yang et al 2015 interpreted the correlation between the c3 component of parafac tryptophan like component and ndma fp because of the close association of the composition of ndma precursors with proteins rich in nitrogen even though they analyzed waters collected at drinking water treatment plants they highlighted that the investigated source water may be impacted by effluents from wastewater treatment plants in this study the occurrence of protein like peaks is more relevant because the experiments were carried out by using raw and treated wastewater therefore the results obtained in this study are relevant and demonstrate the relationships between ndma precursors and protein like material measured by fluorescence eem indeed although water quality parameters such as ph temperature salinity carbohydrate protein interactions may affect the dom fluorescence senesi 1990 lee 1997 spencer et al 2007 the presented data demonstrate that the selected fluorescence peaks can be used to track the fate of the ndma precursors at varying wastewater quality throughout a membrane based advanced treatment processes this result corroborates prior research that highlights that dom fluorescence can be used to monitor wastewater quality in different full scale wastewater treatment plants murphy et al 2011 sgroi et al 2017b such correlation between dom fluorescence and wastewater quality are usually observed for municipal wastewater at typical environmental conditions but may not be valid for other wastewater furthermore the use of the i1 i2 i3 i4 and i5 peaks that are defined as the maximum fluorescence intensity recorded in each of the five typical eem regions chen et al 2003 sgroi et al 2017a 2017b could also help to catch the peak regardless of any spectral shift due to a change in water quality e g ph overall the correlations observed between the ndma fp and the fluorescence peaks i1 i2 and i4 during the mbr process and during the complete pilot treatment train mbr nf highlight that the fate of ndma precursors throughout the membrane based advanced treatment process can be tracked by monitoring the protein like peaks of dom fluorescence 4 conclusions in this study the fate of ndma precursors and dom fluorescence was tracked throughout a pilot scale mbr nf wastewater treatment plants furthermore very strong correlations were found between ndma precursors concentrations and the fluorescence of protein like material sampled at different stage of the mbr nf system based on the results of the study the following conclusions can be drawn removal of pharmaceuticals selected as ndma precursors during the mbr process was compound specific while the removal of the whole ndma precursors ndma fp was higher than such pharmaceuticals mbr removes the protein like peaks of dom fluorescence better than the fulvic and humic like peaks the removal of ndma precursors and of dom fluorescence peaks by nf was higher than 90 and 95 respectively median values strong correlations were found between the averaged concentrations of selected ndma precursors i e ranitidine azithromycin erythromycin o desmethylvenlafaxine and ndma fp throughout the mbr nf pilot system the removal of ndma fp was correlated with the removal of fluorescence peaks that represent protein like materials i1 i2 and i4 during the mbr process r2 0 64 a very strong correlation r2 0 89 was also found between the averaged concentrations of ndma fp and the fluorescence peaks i1 i2 and i4 observed throughout the mbr nf pilot plant the aforementioned results highlight that protein like peaks of fluorescence dom of wastewater can be used to monitor the fate of ndma precursors including specific pharmaceuticals and the whole group of precursors in membrane base advanced treatment

18027,access to clean water is one of the targets in the un sustainable development goals however millions of people are still without basic water services predominantly in rural areas in developing nations previous studies have investigated the environmental impacts of water provision but they mostly focused on large scale urban systems this paper considers for the first time the life cycle environmental impacts of different water supply options applicable to remote communities in developing countries focusing on the southeast asia pacific seap context a cradle to grave approach is followed to estimate the impacts of locally sourced groundwater surface water and desalinated seawater as well as externally sourced bottled water the results reveal that surface water is environmentally the most sustainable alternative locally desalinated water powered by diesel electricity has two orders of magnitude higher impacts than surface water however externally sourced water in plastic bottles is the worst option with 4 155 times higher impacts than desalinated water and up to three orders of magnitude higher impacts than surface water this is largely due to the impacts related to the production of bottles doubling their recycling would reduce the impacts by 7 23 but bottled water would still be environmentally the least sustainable option although water in single use bottles currently provides only 3 of the water supply of a representative remote community in the seap region considered in this study it accounts on average for more than 50 of the total impacts from water consumption by 2030 population increase could lead to greater reliance of remote communities on bottled water and 60 73 higher impacts of water consumption per household relying solely on local surface ground and water desalinated using solar power and avoiding bottled water would reduce the impacts by 33 99 relative to the current situation this would also improve considerably water availability and security in remote communities the findings of this study will be of interest to national and local governments developing future policies aimed at increasing access of remote

protection of water sources from contamination and the collection time required satisfactory achievement of these indicators e g 30 min collection time available 12 h day is termed basic water service which was available to 89 of the global population in 2015 who unicef 2017 however this still leaves 844 million people who use contaminated water sources or require more than 30 min to collect water there is also a significant gap in water access between urban and rural areas 95 vs 80 respectively who unicef 2017 while national budgets and development assistance for water are increasing implementation in remote areas is lagging who 2017 given the volume of water required for human consumption the environmental impacts of water technologies and supply have been studied at various scales using life cycle assessment lca however there are many more lca studies at the process and plant scales than at the system level loubet et al 2014 studies comparing different technology options to utilise specific water resources e g groundwater bhakar and singh 2018 pradeleix et al 2015 or seawater raluy et al 2005 have identified energy use as the common hotspot for environmental impacts city and regional scale studies have found consistently that water from natural freshwater sources has the lowest impacts whether based in europe garfí et al 2016 godskesen et al 2011 asia hsien et al 2019 li et al 2016 or north america lyons et al 2009 it has also been reported that desalination has higher impacts due to greater energy requirements while the impacts of bottled water were mainly due to the manufacturing of the bottle garfí et al 2016 existing water networks such as those in mexico city garcía sánchez and güereca 2019 copenhagen godskesen et al 2013 trondheim slagstad and brattebø 2014 segura basin uche et al 2014 and sicily del borghi et al 2013 have also been evaluated using lca they have all found that the main hotspot for most impacts is electricity required for desalination and long distance piping of water recommendations for improving existing water networks include promotion of electricity sources with lower impacts or alternative sources such as water reuse at the highest geographic level the water supply mixes for different countries and basins have been modelled under current conditions leão et al 2018 and projected up to 2040 leão et al 2019b for application in lca changes in climate demographics and technology were used as driving factors to estimate water supply and consumption in future scenarios the regionalisation of water supply including the underlying electricity mix was found to influence significantly the environmental impacts for different user types leão et al 2019a 2019b while these studies were limited by data availability their methods and application to environmental assessment support the use of locally adapted inventories consistent with the scope of the lca performed while lca has been applied to many urban water systems there is a lack of studies of water supply to remote communities without access to the mains water supply planning requires attention in developing rural communities especially where use for irrigation is high when water withdrawals from local sources are limited by well capacity or irrigation demand households may utilise low quality or contaminated water sources or purchase bottled water to meet domestic water demand however these are not ideal solutions due to health risks and increased cost of living respectively desalination may provide an answer to water supply in remote areas but its feasibility will also depend on the electricity available at the location as well as local capacity to manage operations to fill this knowledge gap this study evaluates for the first time the life cycle environmental impacts of different water supply options in remote communities the following sources of potable water are considered groundwater surface water water in single use 1 5 litre bottles and water delivered in 18 9 litre 5 gallon reusable containers desalination of seawater is also included as a potential technology that could be deployed in remote communities in the future the study focuses on the southeast asia region which has over 119 million rural residents 9 6 of total rural population in the region without basic access to water who unicef 2017 both the current situation and possible future 2030 scenarios for water supply are evaluated the insights gained from this work can be used to support development of more sustainable water access programmes and policies in developing regions 2 methodology water supply options and future scenarios have been evaluated using the iso 14040 14044 iso 2006a 2006b guidelines for lca following an attributional approach the lca modelling has been carried out in gabi v7 3 thinkstep 2016 the goal and scope of the study are described next followed by life cycle inventory data and the impact assessment method used in this work 2 1 goal and scope as previously mentioned the goal of the study is to estimate the life cycle environmental impacts of water supply from the above mentioned sources in remote communities with no access to water mains a further goal is to determine the impacts of household water consumption based on the current and possible future supply with differing contributions of surface ground desalinated and bottled water a scenario analysis has been used for evaluating future water supply the scenarios consider the same time horizon 2030 as the un sdgs potential improvements for identified environmental hotspots are explored through a sensitivity analysis the ultimate aim of these analyses is to identify environmentally the most sustainable water supply sources and their mix helping to inform policy development and its implementation in remote communities the scope of the study is from cradle to grave comprising the following life cycle stages raw materials extraction and processing construction and installation operation and maintenance transport and end of life waste management fig 1 two functional units are considered one related to the different water supply options and another to their mix in the current and future supply systems water supply options 1 m 3 of potable water at household and current situation and future scenarios 197 m 3 per four person household per year based on the estimated minimum volume required for socio economic development chenoweth 2008 2 2 inventory data to anchor the study in a particular context the inventory data are specific to the supply of water in the philippines which has numerous remote communities particularly on its many islands similar conditions are found in rural communities in the rest of the southeast asia region and hence the outcomes of the study are generally applicable across the region the data have been sourced from literature and the ecoinvent 3 1 database ecoinvent association 2014 the quality of the data used in this study has been evaluated through a pedigree matrix weidema et al 2013 for the results of the evaluation see tables s6 and s7 in the supplementary information si 2 2 1 water supply options both locally and externally sourced water are considered for the former the infrastructure for utilising groundwater surface water and seawater is assumed to be installed locally externally sourced water hereafter referred to as imported water is produced further away in large freshwater treatment plants and shipped to the remote community in small 1 5 l or large bottles 5 gal the transfer of water from the collection point e g from the hand pump storage tank or purchase point of bottled water to households is on foot for all options hence this activity is not included in the modelling groundwater is extracted using an open and tube well equipped with a submersible pump with a capacity of 24 m3 day the useful life is 35 years for the open well 20 years for the tube well and 29 000 h for the pump pradeleix et al 2015 surface water can be collected from a river lake dam or pond in the locality a construction similar to the open well is assumed to provide a protected collection point for surface water data for the construction of the desalination plant have been obtained from cherif et al 2016 assuming a useful life of 20 years the reverse osmosis modules require replacements every five years and their inventory data are from lawler et al 2015 a pumping station is considered for imported bottled water assumed to last for 70 years with the data sourced from ecoinvent ecoinvent association 2014 further details can be found in table s1 in the si operational requirements for the various water supply options are summarised in table 1 desalination of seawater is by reverse osmosis the most common process for desalination byrne et al 2015 the desalination process has been simulated in the wave software dow chemical company 2017 with 50 water recovery to obtain the energy requirement for seawater reverse osmosis desalination is assumed to be powered by solar photovoltaics pv abdelkareem et al 2018 ghaffour et al 2015 with the pv performance and inventory data sourced from the authors previous work aberilla et al 2020 and ecoinvent ecoinvent association 2014 respectively the pumping station is powered by grid electricity which in the philippines comprises 50 coal 32 gas 8 hydropower 7 geothermal and 3 oil philippine department of energy 2017 the electricity for the groundwater pump and desalination plant is provided by diesel generators as is the case in most off grid communities philippine department of energy 2016 as mentioned earlier imported water is bottled in either 1 5 l single use bottles garfí et al 2016 lagioia et al 2012 or 18 9 l reusable containers mcfarlane 2016 philippine primer 2015 sterling containers llc 2018 see table 2 this translates to approximately 667 single use bottles or 53 reusable containers for 1 m3 of water these are transported 20 km by ferry to the remote community land transport prior to ferry transport is not considered due to a lack of representative data as these distances can vary significantly land transport after the ferry delivery is not expected as water is typically collected on foot in small remote communities and is therefore also excluded the effect on the results of land transport of bottled water is discussed later in the paper the reusable containers are washed with 2 sodium hydroxide solution andoh et al 2013 and reused 33 times mcfarlane 2016 the produced wastewater is treated in a conventional wastewater treatment plant alternative cleaning agents namely sodium metasilicate and detergent formula arendorf et al 2014 are investigated in a sensitivity analysis section 3 1 8 at the end of life plastics aluminium copper and iron are recycled at the rates of 30 47 44 and 39 respectively based on the recycling rates in the region glöser et al 2013 jica and ex corporation 2008 other materials are landfilled as the recycled materials count towards the recycled fraction of materials used in manufacturing at the respective rates of 24 for plastics 19 for aluminium 34 for copper and for 10 steel bir ferrous division 2016 jica and ex corporation 2008 tse 2015 the system has been credited for the balance for avoiding primary production i e for 28 of aluminium 29 of steel and 10 of copper for plastics recycling a bottle to pellet material efficiency of 95 is assumed with 12 of the recycled fraction being returned to bottle manufacturing shen et al 2011 for a single recycling loop this translates to 0 22 kg of avoided virgin pet production per kg of pet used for bottles shen et al 2011 for further details see fig s1 and table s2 in the si 2 2 2 current situation and future scenarios as shown in fig 2 the current water supply mix of a typical remote community comprises primarily of natural freshwater sources 65 groundwater and 22 surface water while 13 is obtained from bottled water 1 5 l and 5 gal brought in externally philippine statistics authority 2017 the current situation is compared with four 2030 scenarios developed in this work business as usual bau independent advanced and advanced independent the contribution of different water supply options in each is shown in fig 2 with the rationale for each described below in all future scenarios it is assumed that total extraction of groundwater and surface water will increase up to the expected water stress level forecasted in the domestic sector by 2030 gassert et al 2014 however accounting for projected population growth un desa population division 2017 this results in a 12 net decrease of availability of natural freshwater sources per household in the bau scenario the remainder of the water demand is supplied by imported water with the proportion of 1 5 l and 18 9 l bottled water the same as in the current situation in the independent scenario imported water is replaced by local desalination to consider the implications of self sufficiency in water supply for the advanced and advanced independent scenarios an increase in water demand to 260 m3 per household per year national average fao 2011 is considered to represent improved living standards of the remote community desalination provides for the additional requirement in the advanced scenario as well as replacing imported water in the advanced independent scenario while it is assumed in the base case for the advanced scenario that only desalination provides the additional demand a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the range that imported water can also contribute to satisfying the increased demand similar to the independent the advanced independent scenario represents a water supply mix that is sourced exclusively locally these scenarios represent a community that has self sufficient local water production and independence from imported bottled water the grid electricity mix assumed for the current situation and the bau and advanced scenarios corresponds to the current supply mix in the philippines i e 50 coal 32 gas 8 hydropower 7 geothermal and 3 oil see the previous section in the independent and advanced independent scenarios diesel electricity generated locally and used for water abstraction and desalination is replaced by solar pv 2 3 life cycle impact assessment the hierarchist midpoint indicators in the recipe 1 08 method goedkoop et al 2013 are used to estimate the environmental impacts to streamline the discussion in the next section the 18 indicators in the recipe methodology are grouped into the following seven environmental issues climate change global warming potential gwp excluding biogenic co2 air pollution ozone depletion odp photochemical oxidant formation pofp and particulate matter formation potentials pmfp eutrophication and acidification freshwater and marine eutrophication potentials fep and mep respectively and terrestrial acidification potential tap ecotoxicity freshwater marine and terrestrial ecotoxicity potentials fetp metp and tetp

occupation potentials ulop and human health human toxicity htp and ionising radiation potentials irp 3 results and discussion this section first discusses the environmental impacts of different water supply options this is followed in section 3 2 by the environmental implications of future scenarios in comparison to the current situation each section also includes a sensitivity analysis carried out to test the effect of key parameters and assumptions that could influence the outcomes of the study 3 1 environmental impacts of water supply options as can be inferred from fig 3 utilisation of locally available resources especially surface water has the lowest impacts across all 18 categories on the other hand imported water in single use bottles has the highest impacts in all categories with values 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of surface water utilisation the only exception is odp for which reusable bottles have the highest impact a similar scale of difference in environmental impacts has been reported in previous studies comparing tap water and packaged water in developed urban areas garfí et al 2016 lagioia et al 2012 bottled water has also 4 155 times higher impacts than desalinated water despite the latter relying on diesel electricity for the reverse osmosis process infrastructure has minimal contribution to the life cycle environmental impacts except for surface water utilisation however poor maintenance of the infrastructure may lead to shorter lifetimes resulting in greater contribution to the impacts per amount of water supplied the operation stage dominates the impacts of groundwater extraction and desalination while manufacturing of bottles is the key hotspot for imported water on average water delivered in 18 9 l reusable bottles has 69 lower impacts than water in single use 1 5 l bottles further discussion of each impact category follows 3 1 1 climate change gwp the gwp of surface water is estimated at 44 g co2 eq m3 while that of ground water is almost ten times higher due to the electricity used for pumping high energy consumption for desalination also results in a gwp almost 100 times higher than for surface water electricity use accounts for 89 and 99 of the impact from groundwater extraction and seawater desalination respectively however imported bottled water has a gwp 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than any of the local options 20 1 kg co2 eq m3 for reusable large bottles and 79 kg co2 eq m3 for single use smaller bottles this is largely due to the impact from the production of the bottles 3 9 kg co2 eq m3 for reusable and 70 kg co2 eq m3 for single use bottles electricity used in the bottling stage has a gwp of 9 2 kg co2 eq m3 while caustic soda for washing of reusable containers adds 6 4 kg co2 eq m3 transportation of bottled water is responsible for 841 g co2 eq m3 which contributes 4 to the total gwp of imported water the rest of the impact is generated during water production 380 g co2 eq m3 at the pumping station primarily due to the coal dominated electricity mix the results obtained in this work are generally comparable to the values reported previously in literature for example gwp values for 1 5 l bottled water range from 75 garfí et al 2016 to 178 kg co2 eq m3 jungbluth 2006 with the impact of 79 4 kg estimated in the current work being closer to the lower end of the literature range the gwp estimates for grid connected desalination vary from 1 3 godskesen et al 2017 to 8 9 kg co2 eq m3 hu et al 2013 with the gwp of 4 26 kg co2 eq m3 determined here being in the middle of the range however the gwp for groundwater extraction determined here is higher 420 g co2 eq m3 than a literature value of 190 g co2 eq m3 godskesen et al 2017 this is due to the latter considering an urban treatment plant in denmark with a lower energy consumption 0 27 compared to 0 35 kwh m3 in this study similarly conventional urban supply from surface water has a higher gwp than in the current work 44 g co2 eq m3 which span a wide range of values from 58 hu et al 2013 to 802 g co2 eq m3 hsien et al 2019 depending on the level of treatment prior to distribution for reusable 18 9 l water bottles a study by jungbluth 2006 reported a 4 5 times higher gwp 90 kg co2 eq m3 but the transportation distance was three times higher than here 3 1 2 air pollution odp pmfp pofp surface water has the lowest odp pmfp and pofp electricity from diesel generators is the primary 95 source of air pollution impacts from the groundwater and desalination processes electricity used for desalination is ten times higher than that for the pumping station but contributions to air pollution impacts are 40 114 times higher almost all 98 of the odp pmfp and pofp of imported water is attributed to the bottling stage for water bottled in 18 9 l reusable containers 88 of the life cycle odp 3 71 mg cfc 11 eq m3 comes from the cleaning step due to ccl4 emissions in the production of caustic soda 3 1 3 eutrophication and acidification fep mep tap desalination has 65 higher fep 48 times higher mep and 22 times higher tap than the pumping station at the operation stage off grid groundwater pump operation also has four times higher mep and double the tap of the on grid pumping station due to higher nox emissions from off grid electricity relative to the grid mix however considering the overall life cycle bottled water has 30 763 higher eutrophication and acidification than groundwater more than 60 of the fep mep and tap of water in 1 5 l bottles is attributed to the bottle for water in 18 9 l bottles the bottle contributes 41 to the mep but energy use in the bottling stage is the main source 45 of fep and tap 3 1 4 ecotoxicity fetp metp tetp ecotoxicity impacts of surface water collection are 0 005 1 8 g 1 4 db eq m3 most of the impacts 82 are generated in the infrastructure stage specifically due to associated emissions in the production of concrete the operation stage contributes 58 84 of the ecotoxicity potential of groundwater extraction and 96 for desalination the impacts of imported bottled water are 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of surface water with almost all of the impacts attributed to the bottling stage for water in single use smaller bottles production of plastics is the key hotspot contributing 85 in fetp and metp and 51 in tetp for the larger reusable bottles cleaning agents used for the cleaning cause 75 to fetp and metp and 40 to tetp 3 1 5 resource depletion fdp mdp wdp trends similar to the previous categories are also found for resource depletion i e surface water has the lowest and 1 5 l bottled water the highest impacts the fdp of the desalination and groundwater extraction is significantly higher than for the other options due to the use of diesel generated electricity the mdp is dominated by the infrastructure stage in the groundwater and surface water systems 69 and 97 respectively but the desalination process leads in mdp contribution 81 due to the greater use of the diesel generator production of single use bottles is responsible for almost all of the mdp of water in 1 5 l bottles 94 cleaning of reusable bottles is the main hotspot for 18 9 l bottles contributing 63 to the total mdp the values for wdp shown in fig 3 include the amount of water delivered to the consumer i e the functional unit of 1 m3 hence the value after subtracting that amount from the total can be interpreted as the virtual or embedded water depletion surface water has 70 l m3 of embedded water mostly due to the construction of the infrastructure groundwater and seawater desalination have similar embedded water estimated at 150 170 l m3 significantly higher embedded water depletion 50 141 m3 m3 is seen for the bottled water resulting from plastics production and bottle cleaning 3 1 6 land use alop nltp ulop land use impacts of groundwater and desalination are proportional to the electricity consumption due to upstream impacts in the extraction and processing of diesel similar to the other impacts the bottled water has the highest land use impacts due to plastics production 50 for alop nltp and ulop and printed paper used for labelling the single use bottles 48 for alop 3 1 7 human health htp irp the htp and irp are the lowest for surface water 17 g 1 4 db eq m3 and 3 g u 235 eq m3 respectively around a half of the htp is attributable to emissions of manganese and zinc from concrete and steel production emissions of rn 222 and c 14 mainly from concrete production are the major sources of irp the htp of infrastructure in the groundwater and desalination systems is comparable to that of surface water but the hotspot in the life cycle of these options can be traced to the diesel supply chain for the production of electricity while the htp and irp per kwh are higher for the grid than for diesel electricity the operation stage of imported water i e pumping station has lower impacts per m3 due to the lower energy requirement nonetheless imported water has up to three orders of magnitude higher htp and irp than locally produced water because of the impacts associated with the bottle single use bottles are responsible for 80 of human health impacts while caustic soda in the cleaning of reusable bottles contributes 62 to htp and 77 to irp 3 1 8 sensitivity analysis for bottled water the results show that imported bottled water has significantly higher impacts than the locally sourced water mainly due to plastic bottles and caustic soda used for washing reusable water containers to evaluate the potential effects of these two parameters on the total impacts of bottled water a sensitivity analysis has been carried out considering different plastics recycling rates and cleaning chemicals 3 1 8 1 plastics recycling as mentioned in section 2 2 1 the end of life recycling rate and the recycled fraction of plastics in the base case are 30 and 24 respectively here they are varied from 25 to 100 yielding end of life recycling rates of 22 5 60 and recycled fractions of 18 48 the lower values approach the global average recycling rates of 14 18 oecd 2018 while the higher values may have already been achieved in informal sectors in developing countries wilson et al 2009 the changes in the seven most affected impact categories are presented in fig 4 for both bottle sizes the results suggest that doubling the recycling of plastics lowers the life cycle impacts by 7 23 for water in 1 5 l bottles and 0 5 10 for water in reusable 18 9 l containers the most sensitive impacts are fetp metp and mep while land use alop nltp and ulop and odp are the least affected in addition to the production process the landfilling of plastics is a main contributor to fetp metp and mep therefore an increase in recycling rate and recycled fraction results in greater reductions in these categories due to avoided impacts in both the production and end of life stages for water in reusable containers odp is not particularly sensitive to the recycling values since the majority of the impact is attributed to the washing stage rather than the containers in summary while there is substantial improvement in the environmental performance resulting from increased recycling especially in developing areas the impacts of bottled water per functional unit remain much higher than for the other options 3 1 8 2 bottle cleaning because cleaning of the reusable containers contributes 29 88 of the life cycle impacts of water in 18 9 l bottles alternative detergents are considered in the sensitivity analysis sodium metasilicate is identified as a substitute for caustic soda as an alkaline detergent in food and beverage applications santos et al 2017 a detergent formula for domestic and industrial dishwashers arendorf et al 2014 is also considered the cleaning agents are assumed to be substitutable based on equivalent sodium composition i e 1 g naoh 2 65 g sodium metasilicate pentahydrate 1 68 g detergent formula given that alkali components are the main decontaminators in cleaning agents nitsch et al 2003 fig 5 shows that using these alternatives increases gwp by 62 111 and 100 in at least eight other categories since sodium metasilicate is produced from the reaction of sodium hydroxide and silica sand zah and hischier 2007 it is not surprising that the additional processing from hydroxide to metasilicate results in higher impacts for this alternative detergent for the detergent formula citric acid which proxies for sodium citrate dihydrate arendorf et al 2014 represents 71 of the impacts of the detergent on average the full dataset for citric acid in the ecoinvent database ecoinvent association 2014 is not publicly available although it is inferred that the purification and waste treatment processes are the primary sources of environmental impacts therefore these results demonstrate that using caustic soda for cleaning is environmentally more sustainable than sodium metasilicate or detergent formula 3 2 environmental impacts of current water supply and future scenarios compared to the current situation the bau scenario has 60 73 higher impacts while the independent scenario has 33 99 lower impacts across the 18 categories fig 6 the higher water demand in the advanced scenario results in increased impacts in ten categories relative to the current situation but a 1 9 reduction in the other eight fep fetp metp mdp wdp alop ulop and htp the advanced independent scenario which also assumes a higher water consumption rate sees an increase in impacts versus the current situation only in ulop all the other impacts are reduced by 72 98 the advanced independent scenario has higher impacts per household than the independent mainly due to greater water consumption overall the independent scenario is the best option for all impact categories because of the absence of bottled water the following sections discuss the results in more detail the discussion refers to the impacts per household for impacts per 1 m3 see table s4 in the si for the contribution analysis for different water supply options in each scenario see fig s2 in the si 3 2 1 climate change gwp the gwp of annual water consumption is estimated at 922 kg co2 eq per household the large majority of this is attributed to bottled water 51 to smaller and 43 to larger bottles the bau scenario has 68 higher impact due to reduced access to local freshwater resources and consequently higher reliance on imported water in contrast the independent scenario has 44 times lower gwp 21 kg co2 eq achieved by replacing imported water with local desalination the advanced scenario has a lower impact per unit of water than the current situation table s4 but the higher household demand increases it by 25 per household the advanced independent scenario demonstrates how a higher water demand can be satisfied while reducing gwp by 96 on the current situation by relying on solar powered desalination and groundwater extraction 3 2 2 air pollution odp pmfp pofp at present imported bottled water contributes disproportionately to the air pollution impacts compared to its share in the supply mix 13 water in the smaller single use bottles has the largest contribution to pmfp 41 and pofp 42 because of plastics production furthermore water in the larger reusable bottles causes 72 of the odp due to the cleaning groundwater also has a significant contribution to pmfp 15 and pofp 22 because of the electricity for pumping the bau scenario has 54 70 higher air pollution impacts than the current situation while the advanced shows an increase of 44 147 the increased impacts in the bau scenario are due to the higher amount of bottled water while in the advanced scenario the increase is mainly attributed to the electricity from diesel used for desalination as a result the latter has a higher contribution to the air pollution impacts in the advanced scenario than bottled water the impacts of the independent and advanced independent scenarios are reduced on average by 97 and 95 respectively due to the absence of bottled water in the supply mix 3 2 3 eutrophication and acidification fep mep tap almost all 97 of the eutrophication impacts fep mep in the current situation are from bottled water it is also the main contributor to tap 90 with groundwater causing the rest of the impact the impacts of the bau scenario are higher for all three impact categories than the current situation in contrast the advanced scenario has 11 lower fep despite its higher water demand due to the addition of desalination to the supply mix both the independent and advanced independent scenarios have significantly lower fep mep and tap than the other scenarios with the former being a better option 3 2 4 ecotoxicity fetp metp tetp the ecotoxicity potentials of the current water supply are dominated by the bottled water with both the smaller and larger bottles having almost equal contributions to fetp and metp but smaller bottles resulting in twice as high tetp as the large containers increased consumption of bottled water in bau leads to 68 72 higher impacts than at present independent and advanced independent the two scenarios without bottled water have 74 95 lower ecotoxicity potentials than the current water supply in the advanced scenario aquatic ecotoxicity potentials fetp and metp are 11 lower but tetp is 7 higher bottled water is the main cause of the impacts in this scenario 77 93 but desalination also contributes significantly to tetp 21 3 2 5 resource depletion fdp mdp wdp in the current situation water in 1 5 l bottles causes 41 62 of resource depletion while water in 18 9 l containers is responsible for 33 49 this is due to the production of plastic bottles as with the previous impact categories the bau scenario has 66 68 higher resource depletion than the current situation because of the greater use of bottled water on the contrary the independent and advanced independent scenarios have the lowest depletion potentials per m3 of water the advanced scenario has lower fdp 8 mdp 25 and wdp 33 than the current water supply however taking into account the annual household demand the higher consumption in the advanced scenario offsets the reductions per m3 resulting in 21 higher fdp and almost equal mdp on the other hand despite the higher consumption total wdp per household is 11 lower in the advanced scenario compared to the current situation due to lower reliance on imported water 3 2 6 land use alop nltp ulop land use impacts especially alop in the current situation are primarily 41 76 caused by water in 1 5 l bottles water in the larger containers contributes a further 22 46 to land requirements as expected the higher share of bottled water in bau results in 62 71 higher land use impacts while its absence in the independent scenario reduces land use by 33 98 interestingly the advanced scenario has 7 lower land occupation alop and ulop than the current situation but 81 higher land transformation potential nltp contribution analysis of this scenario indicates that 54 of the nltp is attributed to desalination more than double that for the bottled water this is associated with diesel derived electricity used for desalination as diesel has a high nltp in the oil extraction stage in the advanced independent scenario reductions in alop and nltp relative to the current situation 95 96 are related to the lower impacts of solar powered desalination which displaces bottled water however the ulop is 43 higher in this scenario due to the urban land occupied by ground pv installations ecoinvent association 2014 3 2 7 human health htp irp almost all 94 of the human health impacts in the current situation are attributed to bottled water all future scenarios except the bau have lower impacts per m3 than the current situation due to lower fractions of imported bottled water in the mix however the higher household consumption in the advanced scenario counteracts the irp reduction resulting in a net 24 higher impact per household in this scenario as with most other impact categories the bau scenario has the highest htp and irp per household while the independent has the lowest in the advanced and advanced independent scenarios desalinated water is the most significant contributor to human health impacts 72 87 mostly attributed to the solar pv system that powers the desalination plant 3 2 8 sensitivity analysis for advanced scenario the results discussed in the previous section indicated that the advanced scenario has lower impacts per m3 in all categories aside from air pollution odp pmfp and pofp tap and nltp however on the basis of the annual household demand the higher water use in this scenario leads to higher impacts in ten categories compared to the current situation unlike the other high consumption scenario advanced independent which meets its higher water demand solely through desalinated water the advanced could meet these requirements with any combination of desalinated and bottled water therefore this sensitivity analysis aims to evaluate the robustness of the above results with respect to the assumed supply mix for the advanced scenario this can also be interpreted as identifying additional sub scenarios with a common basis of increased household water demand the original definition for this scenario assumes the same level of consumption of bottled water as at present with desalination supplying 34 of water to address the shortfall in demand this share of desalinated water is varied from 0 i e the same as the current situation and bau to 42 same as advanced independent scenario with bottled water filling the supply gap the ratio of water supply in 1 5 l and 18 9 l bottles is kept constant as in the base case for this scenario see fig 2 in international contexts the lower desalination shares can represent areas with no access to seawater e g inland communities while the higher end of the sensitivity analysis can refer to regions with greater support for desalination such middle east and north africa international water association 2016 the results in fig 7 indicate that all impact categories are significantly affected by the assumed supply mix fetp fep and metp are most sensitive as they show the highest differences between bottled and desalinated water fig 3 by contrast pmfp and pofp are the least sensitive since they are related to electricity used in the bottled water and desalination systems the former is dominated by coal grid electricity and the latter is generated from diesel with both fuels having comparable pmfp and pofp for the results for the rest of the impacts see table 4 in the si in comparison to the other scenarios the advanced scenario with no desalination pessimistic has per household impacts four times higher than the current situation fig 8 it also has more than twice the impacts of the bau scenario despite having a water demand that is only 32 higher conversely the optimistic variant with the highest desalination share 42 has lower impacts than the current situation in 14 categories while the optimistic case has the same supply mix as the advanced independent scenario this case still depends on diesel generators to operate the desalination process hence pmfp pofp tap and nltp remain higher than in the current situation due to high diesel use in this scenario 4 conclusions and recommendations this study has presented the first life cycle assessment of different water supply options and 2030 scenarios for remote communities in developing countries under current conditions utilisation of local freshwater resources groundwater and surface water has 7 99 lower impacts than off grid desalination as the latter relies on electricity from diesel however imported bottled water has the highest impacts 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than the local groundwater or surface water although bottled water transportation is a considerable contributor the main hotspots for the bottled water are single use bottles and the cleaning of reusable containers doubling the current recycling rate would reduce the impacts of water in single use bottles by 7 23 and in reusable containers by 0 5 10 however bottled water would still remain the worst option this work can also be expanded to include alternative water sources such as water recycling and rainwater harvesting as well as to add wastewater treatment in the scope based on the current water supply mix of typical remote islands in the southeast asia pacific region water in single use bottles accounts on average for 50 of the total environmental impacts of domestic water supply despite providing only 3 of the water due to population increase and forecasted constraints on local freshwater availability greater reliance on imported bottled water is expected by 2030 in the business as usual scenario resulting in 54 72 higher environmental impacts than at present the independent scenario wherein imported water is replaced by locally desalinated water shows significant reductions in all 18 impacts even though desalination requires ten times more energy than a pumping station per m3 of water produced the advanced scenario which assumes better quality of life and consequently greater household water demand shows mixed results as eight impacts are reduced and the other impacts are increased compared to the current situation introduction of desalination to the supply mix of this scenario lowers the impacts per m3 except in air pollution acidification and land transformation however higher water use per household counteracts the impact reductions achieved by avoiding imports alternatively if imported water provided for the new demand the impacts of household water use would be more than four times higher than at present finally the advanced independent scenario examines whether water security and demand growth can be satisfied while also reducing the impacts of water consumption the results show that relying on solar powered desalination can achieve these objectives and also lower almost all environmental impacts significantly relative to the current supply and demand of water although the models used in this work correspond to southeast asia pacific conditions the insights gained are applicable to remote communities with similar geographic and socio economic conditions for one off grid desalination is more energy intensive than local water utilisation and hence is less environmentally preferred especially if off grid electricity is generated from traditionally used diesel generators however desalination has significantly lower impacts than imported water which requires plastic bottles and transportation before it can be accessed by households in remote communities the environmental impacts of off grid desalination can be reduced by up to 98 by coupling it with renewable energy sources the environmental savings can even be large enough to allow higher water consumption which is required for community development while simultaneously reducing the impacts per household to adapt the results to specific local conditions primary data will be needed on household water consumption and the water supply mix these can then be used to develop future scenarios based on techno economic or socio political constraints it is also recommended to engage with local stakeholders to elucidate aspirations that can be integrated into the scenario analysis alternative methods for estimating the impacts of water consumption such as aware boulay et al 2018 and water stress index pfister et al 2013 can also be used especially for regionalised water footprints the results from this study demonstrate the challenges in the water energy nexus in remote communities and highlight that planning of water and energy supply systems need to be coordinated with each other if the sustainable development goals are to be met this can be achieved through integrated analyses of energy and water utilities in the context of developing communities furthermore future work should also address the integrated planning and sustainability assessment of utility

18027,access to clean water is one of the targets in the un sustainable development goals however millions of people are still without basic water services predominantly in rural areas in developing nations previous studies have investigated the environmental impacts of water provision but they mostly focused on large scale urban systems this paper considers for the first time the life cycle environmental impacts of different water supply options applicable to remote communities in developing countries focusing on the southeast asia pacific seap context a cradle to grave approach is followed to estimate the impacts of locally sourced groundwater surface water and desalinated seawater as well as externally sourced bottled water the results reveal that surface water is environmentally the most sustainable alternative locally desalinated water powered by diesel electricity has two orders of magnitude higher impacts than surface water however externally sourced water in plastic bottles is the worst option with 4 155 times higher impacts than desalinated water and up to three orders of magnitude higher impacts than surface water this is largely due to the impacts related to the production of bottles doubling their recycling would reduce the impacts by 7 23 but bottled water would still be environmentally the least sustainable option although water in single use bottles currently provides only 3 of the water supply of a representative remote community in the seap region considered in this study it accounts on average for more than 50 of the total impacts from water consumption by 2030 population increase could lead to greater reliance of remote communities on bottled water and 60 73 higher impacts of water consumption per household relying solely on local surface ground and water desalinated using solar power and avoiding bottled water would reduce the impacts by 33 99 relative to the current situation this would also improve considerably water availability and security in remote communities the findings of this study will be of interest to national and local governments developing future policies aimed at increasing access of remote communities to clean water graphical abstract image 1 keywords bottled water desalination groundwater life cycle assessment water energy nexus nomenclature 1 4 db 1 4 dichlorobenzene alop agricultural

protection of water sources from contamination and the collection time required satisfactory achievement of these indicators e g 30 min collection time available 12 h day is termed basic water service which was available to 89 of the global population in 2015 who unicef 2017 however this still leaves 844 million people who use contaminated water sources or require more than 30 min to collect water there is also a significant gap in water access between urban and rural areas 95 vs 80 respectively who unicef 2017 while national budgets and development assistance for water are increasing implementation in remote areas is lagging who 2017 given the volume of water required for human consumption the environmental impacts of water technologies and supply have been studied at various scales using life cycle assessment lca however there are many more lca studies at the process and plant scales than at the system level loubet et al 2014 studies comparing different technology options to utilise specific water resources e g groundwater bhakar and singh 2018 pradeleix et al 2015 or seawater raluy et al 2005 have identified energy use as the common hotspot for environmental impacts city and regional scale studies have found consistently that water from natural freshwater sources has the lowest impacts whether based in europe garfí et al 2016 godskesen et al 2011 asia hsien et al 2019 li et al 2016 or north america lyons et al 2009 it has also been reported that desalination has higher impacts due to greater energy requirements while the impacts of bottled water were mainly due to the manufacturing of the bottle garfí et al 2016 existing water networks such as those in mexico city garcía sánchez and güereca 2019 copenhagen godskesen et al 2013 trondheim slagstad and brattebø 2014 segura basin uche et al 2014 and sicily del borghi et al 2013 have also been evaluated using lca they have all found that the main hotspot for most impacts is electricity required for desalination and long distance piping of water recommendations for improving existing water networks include promotion of electricity sources with lower impacts or alternative sources such as water reuse at the highest geographic level the water supply mixes for different countries and basins have been modelled under current conditions leão et al 2018 and projected up to 2040 leão et al 2019b for application in lca changes in climate demographics and technology were used as driving factors to estimate water supply and consumption in future scenarios the regionalisation of water supply including the underlying electricity mix was found to influence significantly the environmental impacts for different user types leão et al 2019a 2019b while these studies were limited by data availability their methods and application to environmental assessment support the use of locally adapted inventories consistent with the scope of the lca performed while lca has been applied to many urban water systems there is a lack of studies of water supply to remote communities without access to the mains water supply planning requires attention in developing rural communities especially where use for irrigation is high when water withdrawals from local sources are limited by well capacity or irrigation demand households may utilise low quality or contaminated water sources or purchase bottled water to meet domestic water demand however these are not ideal solutions due to health risks and increased cost of living respectively desalination may provide an answer to water supply in remote areas but its feasibility will also depend on the electricity available at the location as well as local capacity to manage operations to fill this knowledge gap this study evaluates for the first time the life cycle environmental impacts of different water supply options in remote communities the following sources of potable water are considered groundwater surface water water in single use 1 5 litre bottles and water delivered in 18 9 litre 5 gallon reusable containers desalination of seawater is also included as a potential technology that could be deployed in remote communities in the future the study focuses on the southeast asia region which has over 119 million rural residents 9 6 of total rural population in the region without basic access to water who unicef 2017 both the current situation and possible future 2030 scenarios for water supply are evaluated the insights gained from this work can be used to support development of more sustainable water access programmes and policies in developing regions 2 methodology water supply options and future scenarios have been evaluated using the iso 14040 14044 iso 2006a 2006b guidelines for lca following an attributional approach the lca modelling has been carried out in gabi v7 3 thinkstep 2016 the goal and scope of the study are described next followed by life cycle inventory data and the impact assessment method used in this work 2 1 goal and scope as previously mentioned the goal of the study is to estimate the life cycle environmental impacts of water supply from the above mentioned sources in remote communities with no access to water mains a further goal is to determine the impacts of household water consumption based on the current and possible future supply with differing contributions of surface ground desalinated and bottled water a scenario analysis has been used for evaluating future water supply the scenarios consider the same time horizon 2030 as the un sdgs potential improvements for identified environmental hotspots are explored through a sensitivity analysis the ultimate aim of these analyses is to identify environmentally the most sustainable water supply sources and their mix helping to inform policy development and its implementation in remote communities the scope of the study is from cradle to grave comprising the following life cycle stages raw materials extraction and processing construction and installation operation and maintenance transport and end of life waste management fig 1 two functional units are considered one related to the different water supply options and another to their mix in the current and future supply systems water supply options 1 m 3 of potable water at household and current situation and future scenarios 197 m 3 per four person household per year based on the estimated minimum volume required for socio economic development chenoweth 2008 2 2 inventory data to anchor the study in a particular context the inventory data are specific to the supply of water in the philippines which has numerous remote communities particularly on its many islands similar conditions are found in rural communities in the rest of the southeast asia region and hence the outcomes of the study are generally applicable across the region the data have been sourced from literature and the ecoinvent 3 1 database ecoinvent association 2014 the quality of the data used in this study has been evaluated through a pedigree matrix weidema et al 2013 for the results of the evaluation see tables s6 and s7 in the supplementary information si 2 2 1 water supply options both locally and externally sourced water are considered for the former the infrastructure for utilising groundwater surface water and seawater is assumed to be installed locally externally sourced water hereafter referred to as imported water is produced further away in large freshwater treatment plants and shipped to the remote community in small 1 5 l or large bottles 5 gal the transfer of water from the collection point e g from the hand pump storage tank or purchase point of bottled water to households is on foot for all options hence this activity is not included in the modelling groundwater is extracted using an open and tube well equipped with a submersible pump with a capacity of 24 m3 day the useful life is 35 years for the open well 20 years for the tube well and 29 000 h for the pump pradeleix et al 2015 surface water can be collected from a river lake dam or pond in the locality a construction similar to the open well is assumed to provide a protected collection point for surface water data for the construction of the desalination plant have been obtained from cherif et al 2016 assuming a useful life of 20 years the reverse osmosis modules require replacements every five years and their inventory data are from lawler et al 2015 a pumping station is considered for imported bottled water assumed to last for 70 years with the data sourced from ecoinvent ecoinvent association 2014 further details can be found in table s1 in the si operational requirements for the various water supply options are summarised in table 1 desalination of seawater is by reverse osmosis the most common process for desalination byrne et al 2015 the desalination process has been simulated in the wave software dow chemical company 2017 with 50 water recovery to obtain the energy requirement for seawater reverse osmosis desalination is assumed to be powered by solar photovoltaics pv abdelkareem et al 2018 ghaffour et al 2015 with the pv performance and inventory data sourced from the authors previous work aberilla et al 2020 and ecoinvent ecoinvent association 2014 respectively the pumping station is powered by grid electricity which in the philippines comprises 50 coal 32 gas 8 hydropower 7 geothermal and 3 oil philippine department of energy 2017 the electricity for the groundwater pump and desalination plant is provided by diesel generators as is the case in most off grid communities philippine department of energy 2016 as mentioned earlier imported water is bottled in either 1 5 l single use bottles garfí et al 2016 lagioia et al 2012 or 18 9 l reusable containers mcfarlane 2016 philippine primer 2015 sterling containers llc 2018 see table 2 this translates to approximately 667 single use bottles or 53 reusable containers for 1 m3 of water these are transported 20 km by ferry to the remote community land transport prior to ferry transport is not considered due to a lack of representative data as these distances can vary significantly land transport after the ferry delivery is not expected as water is typically collected on foot in small remote communities and is therefore also excluded the effect on the results of land transport of bottled water is discussed later in the paper the reusable containers are washed with 2 sodium hydroxide solution andoh et al 2013 and reused 33 times mcfarlane 2016 the produced wastewater is treated in a conventional wastewater treatment plant alternative cleaning agents namely sodium metasilicate and detergent formula arendorf et al 2014 are investigated in a sensitivity analysis section 3 1 8 at the end of life plastics aluminium copper and iron are recycled at the rates of 30 47 44 and 39 respectively based on the recycling rates in the region glöser et al 2013 jica and ex corporation 2008 other materials are landfilled as the recycled materials count towards the recycled fraction of materials used in manufacturing at the respective rates of 24 for plastics 19 for aluminium 34 for copper and for 10 steel bir ferrous division 2016 jica and ex corporation 2008 tse 2015 the system has been credited for the balance for avoiding primary production i e for 28 of aluminium 29 of steel and 10 of copper for plastics recycling a bottle to pellet material efficiency of 95 is assumed with 12 of the recycled fraction being returned to bottle manufacturing shen et al 2011 for a single recycling loop this translates to 0 22 kg of avoided virgin pet production per kg of pet used for bottles shen et al 2011 for further details see fig s1 and table s2 in the si 2 2 2 current situation and future scenarios as shown in fig 2 the current water supply mix of a typical remote community comprises primarily of natural freshwater sources 65 groundwater and 22 surface water while 13 is obtained from bottled water 1 5 l and 5 gal brought in externally philippine statistics authority 2017 the current situation is compared with four 2030 scenarios developed in this work business as usual bau independent advanced and advanced independent the contribution of different water supply options in each is shown in fig 2 with the rationale for each described below in all future scenarios it is assumed that total extraction of groundwater and surface water will increase up to the expected water stress level forecasted in the domestic sector by 2030 gassert et al 2014 however accounting for projected population growth un desa population division 2017 this results in a 12 net decrease of availability of natural freshwater sources per household in the bau scenario the remainder of the water demand is supplied by imported water with the proportion of 1 5 l and 18 9 l bottled water the same as in the current situation in the independent scenario imported water is replaced by local desalination to consider the implications of self sufficiency in water supply for the advanced and advanced independent scenarios an increase in water demand to 260 m3 per household per year national average fao 2011 is considered to represent improved living standards of the remote community desalination provides for the additional requirement in the advanced scenario as well as replacing imported water in the advanced independent scenario while it is assumed in the base case for the advanced scenario that only desalination provides the additional demand a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the range that imported water can also contribute to satisfying the increased demand similar to the independent the advanced independent scenario represents a water supply mix that is sourced exclusively locally these scenarios represent a community that has self sufficient local water production and independence from imported bottled water the grid electricity mix assumed for the current situation and the bau and advanced scenarios corresponds to the current supply mix in the philippines i e 50 coal 32 gas 8 hydropower 7 geothermal and 3 oil see the previous section in the independent and advanced independent scenarios diesel electricity generated locally and used for water abstraction and desalination is replaced by solar pv 2 3 life cycle impact assessment the hierarchist midpoint indicators in the recipe 1 08 method goedkoop et al 2013 are used to estimate the environmental impacts to streamline the discussion in the next section the 18 indicators in the recipe methodology are grouped into the following seven environmental issues climate change global warming potential gwp excluding biogenic co2 air pollution ozone depletion odp photochemical oxidant formation pofp and particulate matter formation potentials pmfp eutrophication and acidification freshwater and marine eutrophication potentials fep and mep respectively and terrestrial acidification potential tap ecotoxicity freshwater marine and terrestrial ecotoxicity potentials fetp metp and tetp

occupation potentials ulop and human health human toxicity htp and ionising radiation potentials irp 3 results and discussion this section first discusses the environmental impacts of different water supply options this is followed in section 3 2 by the environmental implications of future scenarios in comparison to the current situation each section also includes a sensitivity analysis carried out to test the effect of key parameters and assumptions that could influence the outcomes of the study 3 1 environmental impacts of water supply options as can be inferred from fig 3 utilisation of locally available resources especially surface water has the lowest impacts across all 18 categories on the other hand imported water in single use bottles has the highest impacts in all categories with values 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of surface water utilisation the only exception is odp for which reusable bottles have the highest impact a similar scale of difference in environmental impacts has been reported in previous studies comparing tap water and packaged water in developed urban areas garfí et al 2016 lagioia et al 2012 bottled water has also 4 155 times higher impacts than desalinated water despite the latter relying on diesel electricity for the reverse osmosis process infrastructure has minimal contribution to the life cycle environmental impacts except for surface water utilisation however poor maintenance of the infrastructure may lead to shorter lifetimes resulting in greater contribution to the impacts per amount of water supplied the operation stage dominates the impacts of groundwater extraction and desalination while manufacturing of bottles is the key hotspot for imported water on average water delivered in 18 9 l reusable bottles has 69 lower impacts than water in single use 1 5 l bottles further discussion of each impact category follows 3 1 1 climate change gwp the gwp of surface water is estimated at 44 g co2 eq m3 while that of ground water is almost ten times higher due to the electricity used for pumping high energy consumption for desalination also results in a gwp almost 100 times higher than for surface water electricity use accounts for 89 and 99 of the impact from groundwater extraction and seawater desalination respectively however imported bottled water has a gwp 1 3 orders of magnitude higher than any of the local options 20 1 kg co2 eq m3 for reusable large bottles and 79 kg co2 eq m3 for single use smaller bottles this is largely due to the impact from the production of the bottles 3 9 kg co2 eq m3 for reusable and 70 kg co2 eq m3 for single use bottles electricity used in the bottling stage has a gwp of 9 2 kg co2 eq m3 while caustic soda for washing of reusable containers adds 6 4 kg co2 eq m3 transportation of bottled water is responsible for 841 g co2 eq m3 which contributes 4 to the total gwp of imported water the rest of the impact is generated during water production 380 g co2 eq m3 at the pumping station primarily due to the coal dominated electricity mix the results obtained in this work are generally comparable to the values reported previously in literature for example gwp values for 1 5 l bottled water range from 75 garfí et al 2016 to 178 kg co2 eq m3 jungbluth 2006 with the impact of 79 4 kg estimated in the current work being closer to the lower end of the literature range the gwp estimates for grid connected desalination vary from 1 3 godskesen et al 2017 to 8 9 kg co2 eq m3 hu et al 2013 with the gwp of 4 26 kg co2 eq m3 determined here being in the middle of the range however the gwp for groundwater extraction determined here is higher 420 g co2 eq m3 than a literature value of 190 g co2 eq m3 godskesen et al 2017 this is due to the latter considering an urban treatment plant in denmark with a lower energy consumption 0 27 compared to 0 35 kwh m3 in this study similarly conventional urban supply from surface water has a higher gwp than in the current work 44 g co2 eq m3 which span a wide range of values from 58 hu et al 2013 to 802 g co2 eq m3 hsien et al 2019 depending on the level of treatment prior to distribution for reusable 18 9 l water bottles a study by jungbluth 2006 reported a 4 5 times higher gwp 90 kg co2 eq m3 but the transportation distance was three times higher than here 3 1 2 air pollution odp pmfp pofp surface water has the lowest odp pmfp and pofp electricity from diesel generators is the primary 95 source of air pollution impacts from the groundwater and desalination processes electricity used for desalination is ten times higher than that for the pumping station but contributions to air pollution impacts are 40 114 times higher almost all 98 of the odp pmfp and pofp of imported water is attributed to the bottling stage for water bottled in 18 9 l reusable containers 88 of the life cycle odp 3 71 mg cfc 11 eq m3 comes from the cleaning step due to ccl4 emissions in the production of caustic soda 3 1 3 eutrophication and acidification fep mep tap desalination has 65 higher fep 48 times higher mep and 22 times higher tap than the pumping station at the operation stage off grid groundwater pump operation also has four times higher mep and double the tap of the on grid pumping station due to higher nox emissions from off grid electricity relative to the grid mix however considering the overall life cycle bottled water has 30 763 higher eutrophication and acidification than groundwater more than 60 of the fep mep and tap of water in 1 5 l bottles is attributed to the bottle for water in 18 9 l bottles the bottle contributes 41 to the mep but energy use in the bottling stage is the main source 45 of fep and tap 3 1 4 ecotoxicity fetp metp tetp ecotoxicity impacts of surface water collection are 0 005 1 8 g 1 4 db eq m3 most of the impacts 82 are generated in the infrastructure stage specifically due to associated emissions in the production of concrete the operation stage contributes 58 84 of the ecotoxicity potential of groundwater extraction and 96 for desalination the impacts of imported bottled water are 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of surface water with almost all of the impacts attributed to the bottling stage for water in single use smaller bottles production of plastics is the key hotspot contributing 85 in fetp and metp and 51 in tetp for the larger reusable bottles cleaning agents used for the cleaning cause 75 to fetp and metp and 40 to tetp 3 1 5 resource depletion fdp mdp wdp trends similar to the previous categories are also found for resource depletion i e surface water has the lowest and 1 5 l bottled water the highest impacts the fdp of the desalination and groundwater extraction is significantly higher than for the other options due to the use of diesel generated electricity the mdp is dominated by the infrastructure stage in the groundwater and surface water systems 69 and 97 respectively but the desalination process leads in mdp contribution 81 due to the greater use of the diesel generator production of single use bottles is responsible for almost all of the mdp of water in 1 5 l bottles 94 cleaning of reusable bottles is the main hotspot for 18 9 l bottles contributing 63 to the total mdp the values for wdp shown in fig 3 include the amount of water delivered to the consumer i e the functional unit of 1 m3 hence the value after subtracting that amount from the total can be interpreted as the virtual or embedded water depletion surface water has 70 l m3 of embedded water mostly due to the construction of the infrastructure groundwater and seawater desalination have similar embedded water estimated at 150 170 l m3 significantly higher embedded water depletion 50 141 m3 m3 is seen for the bottled water resulting from plastics production and bottle cleaning 3 1 6 land use alop nltp ulop land use impacts of groundwater and desalination are proportional to the electricity consumption due to upstream impacts in the extraction and processing of diesel similar to the other impacts the bottled water has the highest land use impacts due to plastics production 50 for alop nltp and ulop and printed paper used for labelling the single use bottles 48 for alop 3 1 7 human health htp irp the htp and irp are the lowest for surface water 17 g 1 4 db eq m3 and 3 g u 235 eq m3 respectively around a half of the htp is attributable to emissions of manganese and zinc from concrete and steel production emissions of rn 222 and c 14 mainly from concrete production are the major sources of irp the htp of infrastructure in the groundwater and desalination systems is comparable to that of surface water but the hotspot in the life cycle of these options can be traced to the diesel supply chain for the production of electricity while the htp and irp per kwh are higher for the grid than for diesel electricity the operation stage of imported water i e pumping station has lower impacts per m3 due to the lower energy requirement nonetheless imported water has up to three orders of magnitude higher htp and irp than locally produced water because of the impacts associated with the bottle single use bottles are responsible for 80 of human health impacts while caustic soda in the cleaning of reusable bottles contributes 62 to htp and 77 to irp 3 1 8 sensitivity analysis for bottled water the results show that imported bottled water has significantly higher impacts than the locally sourced water mainly due to plastic bottles and caustic soda used for washing reusable water containers to evaluate the potential effects of these two parameters on the total impacts of bottled water a sensitivity analysis has been carried out considering different plastics recycling rates and cleaning chemicals 3 1 8 1 plastics recycling as mentioned in section 2 2 1 the end of life recycling rate and the recycled fraction of plastics in the base case are 30 and 24 respectively here they are varied from 25 to 100 yielding end of life recycling rates of 22 5 60 and recycled fractions of 18 48 the lower values approach the global average recycling rates of 14 18 oecd 2018 while the higher values may have already been achieved in informal sectors in developing countries wilson et al 2009 the changes in the seven most affected impact categories are presented in fig 4 for both bottle sizes the results suggest that doubling the recycling of plastics lowers the life cycle impacts by 7 23 for water in 1 5 l bottles and 0 5 10 for water in reusable 18 9 l containers the most sensitive impacts are fetp metp and mep while land use alop nltp and ulop and odp are the least affected in addition to the production process the landfilling of plastics is a main contributor to fetp metp and mep therefore an increase in recycling rate and recycled fraction results in greater reductions in these categories due to avoided impacts in both the production and end of life stages for water in reusable containers odp is not particularly sensitive to the recycling values since the majority of the impact is attributed to the washing stage rather than the containers in summary while there is substantial improvement in the environmental performance resulting from increased recycling especially in developing areas the impacts of bottled water per functional unit remain much higher than for the other options 3 1 8 2 bottle cleaning because cleaning of the reusable containers contributes 29 88 of the life cycle impacts of water in 18 9 l bottles alternative detergents are considered in the sensitivity analysis sodium metasilicate is identified as a substitute for caustic soda as an alkaline detergent in food and beverage applications santos et al 2017 a detergent formula for domestic and industrial dishwashers arendorf et al 2014 is also considered the cleaning agents are assumed to be substitutable based on equivalent sodium composition i e 1 g naoh 2 65 g sodium metasilicate pentahydrate 1 68 g detergent formula given that alkali components are the main decontaminators in cleaning agents nitsch et al 2003 fig 5 shows that using these alternatives increases gwp by 62 111 and 100 in at least eight other categories since sodium metasilicate is produced from the reaction of sodium hydroxide and silica sand zah and hischier 2007 it is not surprising that the additional processing from hydroxide to metasilicate results in higher impacts for this alternative detergent for the detergent formula citric acid which proxies for sodium citrate dihydrate arendorf et al 2014 represents 71 of the impacts of the detergent on average the full dataset for citric acid in the ecoinvent database ecoinvent association 2014 is not publicly available although it is inferred that the purification and waste treatment processes are the primary sources of environmental impacts therefore these results demonstrate that using caustic soda for cleaning is environmentally more sustainable than sodium metasilicate or detergent formula 3 2 environmental impacts of current water supply and future scenarios compared to the current situation the bau scenario has 60 73 higher impacts while the independent scenario has 33 99 lower impacts across the 18 categories fig 6 the higher water demand in the advanced scenario results in increased impacts in ten categories relative to the current situation but a 1 9 reduction in the other eight fep fetp metp mdp wdp alop ulop and htp the advanced independent scenario which also assumes a higher water consumption rate sees an increase in impacts versus the current situation only in ulop all the other impacts are reduced by 72 98 the advanced independent scenario has higher impacts per household than the independent mainly due to greater water consumption overall the independent scenario is the best option for all impact categories because of the absence of bottled water the following sections discuss the results in more detail the discussion refers to the impacts per household for impacts per 1 m3 see table s4 in the si for the contribution analysis for different water supply options in each scenario see fig s2 in the si 3 2 1 climate change gwp the gwp of annual water consumption is estimated at 922 kg co2 eq per household the large majority of this is attributed to bottled water 51 to smaller and 43 to larger bottles the bau scenario has 68 higher impact due to reduced access to local freshwater resources and consequently higher reliance on imported water in contrast the independent scenario has 44 times lower gwp 21 kg co2 eq achieved by replacing imported water with local desalination the advanced scenario has a lower impact per unit of water than the current situation table s4 but the higher household demand increases it by 25 per household the advanced independent scenario demonstrates how a higher water demand can be satisfied while reducing gwp by 96 on the current situation by relying on solar powered desalination and groundwater extraction 3 2 2 air pollution odp pmfp pofp at present imported bottled water contributes disproportionately to the air pollution impacts compared to its share in the supply mix 13 water in the smaller single use bottles has the largest contribution to pmfp 41 and pofp 42 because of plastics production furthermore water in the larger reusable bottles causes 72 of the odp due to the cleaning groundwater also has a significant contribution to pmfp 15 and pofp 22 because of the electricity for pumping the bau scenario has 54 70 higher air pollution impacts than the current situation while the advanced shows an increase of 44 147 the increased impacts in the bau scenario are due to the higher amount of bottled water while in the advanced scenario the increase is mainly attributed to the electricity from diesel used for desalination as a result the latter has a higher contribution to the air pollution impacts in the advanced scenario than bottled water the impacts of the independent and advanced independent scenarios are reduced on average by 97 and 95 respectively due to the absence of bottled water in the supply mix 3 2 3 eutrophication and acidification fep mep tap almost all 97 of the eutrophication impacts fep mep in the current situation are from bottled water it is also the main contributor to tap 90 with groundwater causing the rest of the impact the impacts of the bau scenario are higher for all three impact categories than the current situation in contrast the advanced scenario has 11 lower fep despite its higher water demand due to the addition of desalination to the supply mix both the independent and advanced independent scenarios have significantly lower fep mep and tap than the other scenarios with the former being a better option 3 2 4 ecotoxicity fetp metp tetp the ecotoxicity potentials of the current water supply are dominated by the bottled water with both the smaller and larger bottles having almost equal contributions to fetp and metp but smaller bottles resulting in twice as high tetp as the large containers increased consumption of bottled water in bau leads to 68 72 higher impacts than at present independent and advanced independent the two scenarios without bottled water have 74 95 lower ecotoxicity potentials than the current water supply in the advanced scenario aquatic ecotoxicity potentials fetp and metp are 11 lower but tetp is 7 higher bottled water is the main cause of the impacts in this scenario 77 93 but desalination also contributes significantly to tetp 21 3 2 5 resource depletion fdp mdp wdp in the current situation water in 1 5 l bottles causes 41 62 of resource depletion while water in 18 9 l containers is responsible for 33 49 this is due to the production of plastic bottles as with the previous impact categories the bau scenario has 66 68 higher resource depletion than the current situation because of the greater use of bottled water on the contrary the independent and advanced independent scenarios have the lowest depletion potentials per m3 of water the advanced scenario has lower fdp 8 mdp 25 and wdp 33 than the current water supply however taking into account the annual household demand the higher consumption in the advanced scenario offsets the reductions per m3 resulting in 21 higher fdp and almost equal mdp on the other hand despite the higher consumption total wdp per household is 11 lower in the advanced scenario compared to the current situation due to lower reliance on imported water 3 2 6 land use alop nltp ulop land use impacts especially alop in the current situation are primarily 41 76 caused by water in 1 5 l bottles water in the larger containers contributes a further 22 46 to land requirements as expected the higher share of bottled water in bau results in 62 71 higher land use impacts while its absence in the independent scenario reduces land use by 33 98 interestingly the advanced scenario has 7 lower land occupation alop and ulop than the current situation but 81 higher land transformation potential nltp contribution analysis of this scenario indicates that 54 of the nltp is attributed to desalination more than double that for the bottled water this is associated with diesel derived electricity used for desalination as diesel has a high nltp in the oil extraction stage in the advanced independent scenario reductions in alop and nltp relative to the current situation 95 96 are related to the lower impacts of solar powered desalination which displaces bottled water however the ulop is 43 higher in this scenario due to the urban land occupied by ground pv installations ecoinvent association 2014 3 2 7 human health htp irp almost all 94 of the human health impacts in the current situation are attributed to bottled water all future scenarios except the bau have lower impacts per m3 than the current situation due to lower fractions of imported bottled water in the mix however the higher household consumption in the advanced scenario counteracts the irp reduction resulting in a net 24 higher impact per household in this scenario as with most other impact categories the bau scenario has the highest htp and irp per household while the independent has the lowest in the advanced and advanced independent scenarios desalinated water is the most significant contributor to human health impacts 72 87 mostly attributed to the solar pv system that powers the desalination plant 3 2 8 sensitivity analysis for advanced scenario the results discussed in the previous section indicated that the advanced scenario has lower impacts per m3 in all categories aside from air pollution odp pmfp and pofp tap and nltp however on the basis of the annual household demand the higher water use in this scenario leads to higher impacts in ten categories compared to the current situation unlike the other high consumption scenario advanced independent which meets its higher water demand solely through desalinated water the advanced could meet these requirements with any combination of desalinated and bottled water therefore this sensitivity analysis aims to evaluate the robustness of the above results with respect to the assumed supply mix for the advanced scenario this can also be interpreted as identifying additional sub scenarios with a common basis of increased household water demand the original definition for this scenario assumes the same level of consumption of bottled water as at present with desalination supplying 34 of water to address the shortfall in demand this share of desalinated water is varied from 0 i e the same as the current situation and bau to 42 same as advanced independent scenario with bottled water filling the supply gap the ratio of water supply in 1 5 l and 18 9 l bottles is kept constant as in the base case for this scenario see fig 2 in international contexts the lower desalination shares can represent areas with no access to seawater e g inland communities while the higher end of the sensitivity analysis can refer to regions with greater support for desalination such middle east and north africa international water association 2016 the results in fig 7 indicate that all impact categories are significantly affected by the assumed supply mix fetp fep and metp are most sensitive as they show the highest differences between bottled and desalinated water fig 3 by contrast pmfp and pofp are the least sensitive since they are related to electricity used in the bottled water and desalination systems the former is dominated by coal grid electricity and the latter is generated from diesel with both fuels having comparable pmfp and pofp for the results for the rest of the impacts see table 4 in the si in comparison to the other scenarios the advanced scenario with no desalination pessimistic has per household impacts four times higher than the current situation fig 8 it also has more than twice the impacts of the bau scenario despite having a water demand that is only 32 higher conversely the optimistic variant with the highest desalination share 42 has lower impacts than the current situation in 14 categories while the optimistic case has the same supply mix as the advanced independent scenario this case still depends on diesel generators to operate the desalination process hence pmfp pofp tap and nltp remain higher than in the current situation due to high diesel use in this scenario 4 conclusions and recommendations this study has presented the first life cycle assessment of different water supply options and 2030 scenarios for remote communities in developing countries under current conditions utilisation of local freshwater resources groundwater and surface water has 7 99 lower impacts than off grid desalination as the latter relies on electricity from diesel however imported bottled water has the highest impacts 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than the local groundwater or surface water although bottled water transportation is a considerable contributor the main hotspots for the bottled water are single use bottles and the cleaning of reusable containers doubling the current recycling rate would reduce the impacts of water in single use bottles by 7 23 and in reusable containers by 0 5 10 however bottled water would still remain the worst option this work can also be expanded to include alternative water sources such as water recycling and rainwater harvesting as well as to add wastewater treatment in the scope based on the current water supply mix of typical remote islands in the southeast asia pacific region water in single use bottles accounts on average for 50 of the total environmental impacts of domestic water supply despite providing only 3 of the water due to population increase and forecasted constraints on local freshwater availability greater reliance on imported bottled water is expected by 2030 in the business as usual scenario resulting in 54 72 higher environmental impacts than at present the independent scenario wherein imported water is replaced by locally desalinated water shows significant reductions in all 18 impacts even though desalination requires ten times more energy than a pumping station per m3 of water produced the advanced scenario which assumes better quality of life and consequently greater household water demand shows mixed results as eight impacts are reduced and the other impacts are increased compared to the current situation introduction of desalination to the supply mix of this scenario lowers the impacts per m3 except in air pollution acidification and land transformation however higher water use per household counteracts the impact reductions achieved by avoiding imports alternatively if imported water provided for the new demand the impacts of household water use would be more than four times higher than at present finally the advanced independent scenario examines whether water security and demand growth can be satisfied while also reducing the impacts of water consumption the results show that relying on solar powered desalination can achieve these objectives and also lower almost all environmental impacts significantly relative to the current supply and demand of water although the models used in this work correspond to southeast asia pacific conditions the insights gained are applicable to remote communities with similar geographic and socio economic conditions for one off grid desalination is more energy intensive than local water utilisation and hence is less environmentally preferred especially if off grid electricity is generated from traditionally used diesel generators however desalination has significantly lower impacts than imported water which requires plastic bottles and transportation before it can be accessed by households in remote communities the environmental impacts of off grid desalination can be reduced by up to 98 by coupling it with renewable energy sources the environmental savings can even be large enough to allow higher water consumption which is required for community development while simultaneously reducing the impacts per household to adapt the results to specific local conditions primary data will be needed on household water consumption and the water supply mix these can then be used to develop future scenarios based on techno economic or socio political constraints it is also recommended to engage with local stakeholders to elucidate aspirations that can be integrated into the scenario analysis alternative methods for estimating the impacts of water consumption such as aware boulay et al 2018 and water stress index pfister et al 2013 can also be used especially for regionalised water footprints the results from this study demonstrate the challenges in the water energy nexus in remote communities and highlight that planning of water and energy supply systems need to be coordinated with each other if the sustainable development goals are to be met this can be achieved through integrated analyses of energy and water utilities in the context of developing communities furthermore future work should also address the integrated planning and sustainability assessment of utility

18028,elevated concentrations of sulfamate the anion of sulfamic acid were found in surface waters and finished drinking water in germany with concentrations up to 580 μg l and 140 μg l respectively wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent was identified as the dominant source of sulfamate in the urban water cycle as sulfamate concentrations correlated positively 0 77 r 0 99 with concentrations of the wastewater tracer carbamazepine in samples from different waterbodies ozonation and activated sludge experiments proved that sulfamate can be formed from chemical and biological degradation of various precursors molar sulfamate yields were highly compound specific and ranged from 2 to 56 however the transformation of precursors to sulfamate in wwtps and wastewater impacted waterbodies was found to be quantitatively irrelevant since concentrations of sulfamate in these compartments are already high presumably due to its primary use as an acidic cleaning agent sulfamate concentrations in the influent and effluent of studied wwtps ranged from 520 μg l to 1900 μg l and from 490 μg l to 1600 μg l respectively laboratory batch experiments were performed to assess the recalcitrance of sulfamate for chemical oxidation in combination with the results from sampling conducted at full scale waterworks it was shown that common drinking water treatment techniques including ozonation and filtration with activated carbon are not capable to remove sulfamate the results of biodegradation tests and from the analysis of samples taken at four bank filtration sites indicate that sulfamate is attenuated in the sediment water interface of aquatic systems and during aquifer passage under aerobic and anaerobic conditions sulfamate concentrations decreased by between 62 and 99 during aquifer passage at the bank filtration sites considering the few data on short term ecotoxicity about 30 of the presented sulfamate levels in ground and surface water samples did exceed the predicted no effect concentration pnec of sulfamate and thus effects of sulfamate on the aquatic ecosystem of wastewater impacted waterbodies in germany cannot be excluded so far toxicological estimations suggest that no risk to human health is expected by concentrations of sulfamate typically encountered in tap water keywords micropollutants sulfamic acid sulfamate urban water cycle formation potential 1 introduction sulfamic acid sa chemical formula h3no3s is a high production volume chemical hpvc which is widely used for scale removal operations and chemical cleaning due to several advantageous properties including its ability to form highly water soluble compounds with most deposits and its considerably lower corrosivity in comparison to other acids such as sulfuric and hydrochloric acid furthermore it is compatible with corrosion inhibitors ph indicators and wetting agents motamedi et al 2013 yoshikubo and suzuki 2000 consequently sa is used in a wide variety of household and industrial applications for example in desalination plants shkir et al 2013 cooling systems videla 2002 and food processing such as in the dairy industry mcelhatton and marshall 2007 being an inexpensive stable odorless non toxic non volatile non hygroscopic and non corrosive chemical sa has recently emerged as a cost effective and green catalyst for organic synthesis oliveira et al 2016 yahya et al 2016 it is also used in pulp bleaching suess 2010 in superplasticizers zhang et al 2016 in disinfectants for livestock farming hancox et al 2013 and in acidizing treatments of oil and gas bearing rock formations to increase the flow rate of oil or gas out of production wells or the flow rate of oil displacing fluids into injection wells speight 2017 moreover sa is a precursor in the production of the artificial sweeteners sodium cyclamate cyc metzger 2000 and acesulfame potassium ace haber et al 2006 o substituted n substituted or di tri substituted derivatives of sa sulfamates showed attractive possibilities for the drug design of various pharmacological agents such as hiv protease inhibitors and anti cancer drugs winum et al 2005 and have been discussed as a novel class of metal extractants and as super acidic ionic liquids dupont et al 2016 metal sulfamate salts are highly soluble due to the zwitterionic nature of sa and therefore are commonly used in electroplating aruna et al 2014 ammonium sulfamate is utilized in non intumescent coating products for wood ryszard and małgorzata 2016 and textile schindler and hauser 2004 protection due to its numerous applications sa is manufactured in high quantities for the united states national aggregate production volumes were between 4500 and 22 700 t in 2015 epa 2019 according to the european chemical agency echa sa is manufactured and or imported in the european union with 10 000 100 000 t per year echa 2019 for china an online database of chemical suppliers currently lists more than 50 manufacturers and

its anionic form sulfamate nh2so3 table s1 in water under environmentally relevant conditions hence the term sulfamate is used in the following since sa and its salts are used in considerable amounts it can be expected that high loads of sulfamate reach wastewater treatment plants wwtps in fact preliminary measurements in three german wwtps revealed that sulfamate concentrations in raw and treated wastewater can reach up to 2 mg l castronovo et al 2017 and thus are much higher than those of most other anthropogenic micropollutants detected in wastewater so far moreover previous results showed that sulfamate can also be formed by biological degradation castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 photodegradation sang et al 2014 scheurer et al 2014 chlorination li et al 2017 and ozonation buchner et al 2019 of ace furthermore sulfamate was identified as one of the oxidation products of cyc during ozonation scheurer et al 2012 it was found that sulfamate can also be a degradation product of topiramate top a sulfamate substituted monosaccharide when heated 70 c li and rossi 1995 surprisingly to the best of our knowledge sulfonamide containing drugs have not been tested yet for their sulfamate formation potential despite the fact that the sulfonamide functional group is the basis of numerous classes of drugs some of these drugs including the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide hct are widely detected in raw waters used for drinking water production huerta fontela et al 2011 in general little is known to what extent sulfamate can be released from the degradation of potential precursors this is especially relevant as studies have shown the potential of precursors present in drinking water and wastewater to form small and mobile transformation products such as trifluoroacetate scheurer et al 2017 and n nitrosodimethylamine schmidt and brauch 2008 during water treatment the existence of diffuse sources of sulfamate was also discussed in some studies ammonia nh3 may interact with sulfur trioxide so3 in the atmosphere to form sa atmospheric nh3 results from animal wastes fertilizers and vehicle and industrial emissions pawlowski et al 2003 atmospheric so3 is mainly formed in the atmosphere by gas phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide so2 the hydrolysis of so3 has been generally considered as the dominant pathway for the loss of so3 due to the high concentration levels of water in the troposphere however in dry and heavily polluted areas with high concentrations of nh3 ammonolysis of so3 may also be a relevant formation pathway of sa li et al 2018a sarkar et al 2019 due to its high polarity sulfamate is considered to be highly mobile in the aquatic system moreover results of the study conducted by notley 1973 indicate that sulfamate is not susceptible to hydrolysis under environmentally relevant conditions castronovo et al 2017 found that sulfamate is not removed during biological wastewater treatment and stated that sulfamate might be a promising conservative wastewater tracer thus due its high mobility and persistence sulfamate might be ubiquitously present in wastewater impacted surface water and prone to reach drinking water resources sulfamate was already widely detected with concentrations up to 128 μg l in environmental waters in ontario canada concentrations were always 0 1 μg l in bulk precipitation samples and streams and sulfamate was also commonly found in groundwater the authors of the study concluded that both widespread atmospheric deposition and localized land based anthropogenic sources of sulfamate may be relevant van stempvoort et al 2019 however so far information on the persistence of sulfamate in the aquatic environment and during drinking water treatment is scarce and to the best of our knowledge the occurrence of sulfamate in bank filtrate and drinking water has not been reported yet this might be to some extent explained by the fact that prioritization approaches often focus on organic micropollutants and that due to its high polarity sulfamate is not amenable to common routine methods based on reversed phase liquid chromatography rp lc coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ms ms seitz et al 2018 similarly also non target approaches which have recently been successfully applied for the identification of so far unknown micropollutants by lc coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry hrms mainly use rp columns for chromatographic separation and often routinely exclude compounds with masses below 100 da such as sulfamate the aim of the current study was i to elucidate the occurrence of sulfamate in various compartments of the urban water cycle including wwtps surface waters bank filtrate and finished drinking water ii to assess the recalcitrance of sulfamate for chemical oxidation in laboratory batch experiments and iii to evaluate the biological degradation at different redox conditions in laboratory batch experiments a further focus was iv on the investigation to what extent sulfamate can be formed from potential precursors by biological degradation or ozonation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals methanol meoh 99 9 and acetonitrile acn 99 9

environmental samples 2 3 sampling sites and protocol 2 3 1 wastewater treatment plants over the course of five consecutive days 24 h flow proportional composite samples of the influent i e raw sewage and treated effluent from a conventional wwtp i e conventional activated sludge system were taken to test the hypothesis whether wastewater can bear a sulfamate formation potential three day n 2 and seven day n 3 composite samples of influents and effluents were additionally collected at five conventional wwtps wwtp 1 wwtp 5 to evaluate whether wwtps equipped with an activated carbon treatment process are capable to remove sulfamate three consecutive 24 h composite samples were collected from the influent after primary clarifier and the effluent after activated carbon treatment and sand filtration of two additional wwtps wwtp 6 wwtp 7 wwtp 6 uses powdered activated carbon pac followed by sand filtration post treatment of the wwtp 7 consists of 4 parallel sand and 2 granulated activated carbon gac units the wwtps analyzed in this study have a capacity between 31 350 and 875 000 population equivalents pe and are all located in germany with the exception of the wwtp 7 which is situated in switzerland all wastewater samples were stored either in 50 ml polypropylene pp centrifugal tubes or in amber glass bottles at 4 c until analysis 2 3 2 surface waters water samples from 13 different sampling locations along the rhine river were taken between the 21st and the 29th of march 2017 samples were collected using 1 l amber glass bottles as 7 day composite samples by automatic sampling devices except for the sampling locations 5 and 10 where grab samples were taken manually all samples from the river rhine were stored in 1 l amber glass bottles samples from the alb river n 11 were taken on the 22nd of september 2017 as grab samples using 15 ml pp centrifugal tubes samples along the elbe river n 25 were taken from a depth of 50 cm below the water surface using a submersible pump between the 24th of june 2017 and the 12th of july 2017 and were stored in 15 ml pp centrifugal tubes additionally 55 discrete samples were collected on the 12th of november 2018 from various surface waters in the state of lower saxony germany fig 1 while for the alb elbe and rhine samples were collected along the longitudinal profile of the respective river sampling in lower saxony was designed to represent a variety of hydrologically independent surface waters including three lakes all of the samples were stored at 4 c for 1 month until analysis to determine fluxes of sulfamate in a major stream 24 h composite samples were taken from the rhine at koblenz fig 1 sampling point 7 between the 4th and the 26th of march 2017 these samples were stored frozen in 15 ml pp centrifugal tubes for 12 months until analysis to elucidate potential natural attenuation of sulfamate during river flow samples were taken at 4 locations along a segment of the usa river in hesse germany downstream of a conventional wwtp 49 000 pe on three consecutive days in july 2016 the river usa can be characterized as a small siliceous mountain brook and the average discharge at the time of sampling was approximately 0 1 m³ s at sampling location a and 0 2 m³ s at sampling locations c and d respectively to account for the compound load from a small tributary the sampling points b and c were located directly upstream and downstream of the mouth of the creek respectively sampling point d was located upstream of the next wwtp the distance between sampling locations a and b and c and d was about 7 7 and 7 5 km respectively fig s1 at each sampling location three consecutive 24 h time proportional composite samples were taken using automatic sampling devices these samples were stored frozen in 15 ml pp centrifugal tubes for 12 months until analysis based on the estimated retention time sampling at location b and c started with a delay of 1 d and at location d with a delay of 2 d 2 3 3 drinking water utilities raw water used for drinking water production and finished drinking water were sampled at seven waterworks in germany from october 2018 to may 2019 the studied waterworks encompass a variety of drinking water treatment techniques table 1 dwtp 1 dwtp 7 sampling was also conducted at three bank filtration sites adjacent to the rhine river in april 2019 dwtp 8 and in august and september 2019 dwtp 9 and 10 the average retention time from the river to the abstraction well at dwtp 8 dwtp 9 and dwtp 10 is approx 24 d 25 d and 35 d respectively additional samples were taken at a bank filtration site which is operated with water from a wastewater impacted lake in june 2016 and in august 2018 dwtp 11 the retention time from the lake to the sampled observation wells is between 1 and 3 months samples at a specific water utility were taken on the same day and stored in amber glass bottles at 4 c until analysis 1 week 2 4 chemical degradability of sulfamate ozonation c0 49 μg l sulfamate and chlorination c0 9 9 μg l sulfamate batch experiments were conducted in 500 ml glass bottles using local tap water the tap water had a ph of 7 4 a hydrogencarbonate concentration of 322 mg l a dissolved organic carbon content doc of 0 9 mg l an acid neutralizing capacity to ph 4 3 of 5 32 mmol l and a base neutralizing capacity to ph 8 2 of 0 66 mmol l two concentrations of ozone 0 5 and 5 mg l were applied by adding defined volumes of an ozone stock solution approx 25 mg l after defined contact times between 5 min and 60 min 10 ml aliquots were taken from the 500 ml bottle and residual ozone was reduced by the addition of 200 μl of a sodium thiosulfate solution 1 65 g l two concentrations of chlorine 0 2 and 1 mg l were applied by adding a defined volume of a hypochlorite stock solution approx 1 g l after defined contact times between 10 min and 24 h 10 ml aliquots were taken from the 500 ml bottles and residual chlorine was reduced by the addition of 140 μl and 700 μl of a sodium thiosulfate solution 0 7 g l for the low and high chlorine concentration respectively 2 5 biological degradability of sulfamate in sediment water studies degradation of sulfamate in contact with river sediment was assessed by lab experiments according to oecd 308 oecd 2002 amber glass bottles were filled with 100 g fresh sediment and 400 ml water taken from the river rhine in the harbor area of koblenz ehrenbreitstein rhine km 591 4 after an equilibration time of 2 weeks at 22 c the batches were spiked with 400 μg l sulfamate and degradation was studied for a period of 30 d three bottles were constantly aerated throughout the whole incubation to establish oxic conditions to study the persistence of sulfamate also under anaerobic conditions three more bottles were flushed vigorously with argon gas for 30 min and the bottles were sealed with ptfe lined butyl rubber seals anaerobic conditions were confirmed by measuring the redox potentials as well as concentrations of fe ii sulfate and or sulfide during the experiments in addition sterile controls were prepared by autoclaving twice for 20 min at 121 c and were also incubated under aerobic ambient air n 3 and anaerobic argon atmosphere n 3 conditions to examine the abiotic degradation of sulfamate samples were stored frozen at 22 c for 1 month until analysis 2 6 formation of sulfamate by biological degradation of potential precursors in activated sludge the biological degradation of two potential precursors cyc and sac was investigated by conducting a modified oecd guideline 302 b zahn wellens test oecd 1992 cyc and sac were selected as they are typically present in high concentrations in wwtp influent li et al 2018b scheurer et al 2009 and contain a sulfamate and a sulfonamide moiety respectively the preparation of the sewage sludge the verification of the biological activity of the washed sludge and the overall test setup are described in detail in an earlier study scheurer et al 2017 the sludge was collected from a wwtp that showed based on the results of a t test no significant difference α 0 05 between the daily mean sulfamate concentrations in the influent and the effluent over a 5 day period data not shown hence the experiment was based on the assumption that sulfamate itself was stable in the zahn wellens test the test batches for the precursors were each prepared in triplicates and were spiked with an aqueous solution of the potential precursor to obtain a final concentration of 10 mg l precursor samples were collected 0 h 20 h 44 h 71 5 h 116 h 211 h and 334 h after the start of the test evaporation losses from the test bottles were determined by weighting the batches and were compensated before each sampling by adding ultrapure water samples were immediately centrifuged and the supernatant was frozen until analysis 2 7 formation of sulfamate by chemical degradation of potential precursors to study the sulfamate evolution potential of possible precursors by ozonation individual solutions of three artificial sweeteners ace cyc sac the diuretic hct and the anticonvulsant top were treated with ozone hct was selected for the experiment as a representative of sulfonamide drugs the sulfamate formation potential of top was tested since its use as an anti obesity drug is forecasted to grow rapidly in the coming years bloomberg 2019 a concentration of 100 μg l of the potential precursor was applied individually in tap water in 500 ml brown glass bottles and two different ozone dosages 0 5 mg l and 5 mg l were used by adding a defined volume of an ozone stock solution the experiments were conducted using the same water matrix as described in 2 4 table s8 depicts the chemical structures of the predominant species of each precursor at ph 7 4 aliquots 50 ml were taken after contact times between 5 min and 60 min and residual ozone was reduced by adding 1 ml of a sodium thiosulfate solution 1 65 g l the ph of the tap water of each glass bottle was measured again at the end of the experiment to assess the potential of sulfamate formation from the ozonation of wastewater influent and corresponding effluent samples from five wwtps either three day or seven day composite samples were treated with different amounts of the aqueous ozone stock solution this experimental setup was conducted with both filtered and native wastewater samples to elucidate if potential precursors are mainly present in the aqueous phase or adsorbed onto particles an initial dose of 0 5 mg ozone per mg doc toc was chosen as 0 5 mg ozone per mg doc is recommended as the maximum dose for the ozonation of wwtp effluents to prevent the formation of bromate lee et al 2016 therefore doc and toc concentrations of all influent and effluent samples were measured prior to ozonation 2 8 eco toxicological relevance to estimate the ecotoxicological risk linked to the exposure of the aquatic ecosystem to sulfamate a risk quotient rq was determined according to the guideline of the european commission ec 2003 as the quotient between the measured environmental concentration mec of individual surface and groundwater samples and the predicted no effect concentration pnec for sulfamate rqs 1 indicate potential risk to aquatic organisms on the contrary if the rq value is below unity adverse effects are not likely to occur the derivation of the pnec for sulfamate is described in text s4 to qualify the risk to human health a guideline value gv for sulfamate was derived according to the world health organization s who guidance who 2011 the gv for a substance is the concentration in drinking water that is tolerable for lifelong consumption based on the daily drinking water consumption and the age dependent body weight it is calculated as gv tdi bw p c where tdi is the tolerable daily intake bw is the body weight p is the fraction of the tdi allocated to drinking water and c is the daily drinking water consumption the tdi is derived as follows tdi noael af where noael is the no observed adverse effect level and af is the assessment factor 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal during wastewater treatment and occurrence in wwtp effluent the statistical evaluation of influent and effluent concentrations of the conventional wwtps fig 2 wwtp 1 5 supports the findings of castronovo et al 2017 that sulfamate is rather stable in contact with activated sludge moreover no statistically significant α 0 05 change in the sulfamate concentration was observed for the two wwtps which were equipped with an activated carbon treatment step fig 2 wwtp 6 and 7 this is in accordance with the high polarity and negative charge of sulfamate which limits a removal by sorption processes furthermore the daily sampling over five consecutive days monday to friday at one wwtp revealed that sulfamate concentrations in the influent and effluent remain rather constant 62 5 kg of sulfamate per day were released by this wwtp 875 000 pe sulfamate concentrations in the influent and effluent of the studied wwtps ranged from 520 μg l to 1900 μg l and from 490 μg l to 1600 μg l respectively this means that typical sulfamate concentrations in wwtp effluent in germany are more than 1000 times higher than the effluent concentrations of the commonly used pharmaceuticals cbz and diclofenac which are generally detected in the mid ng l range margot et al 2015 the sulfamate concentrations in this study are in the same range as previously reported for three other german wwtps castronovo et al 2017 interestingly much lower sulfamate effluent concentrations were recently reported for 14 municipal wwtps across canada van stempvoort et al 2019 where sulfamate concentrations ranged from approx 11 μg l to 720 μg l average 77 μg l since this dissimilarity cannot solely be explained by differences in the per capita drinking water consumption dilution effects or by differences in the overall hardness of drinking water resources of the two countries it is likely that sulfamate is used in much higher per capita quantities in germany compared to canada 3 2 occurrence and main sources of sulfamate in surface waters fig 3 depicts the concentrations of sulfamate and the anticonvulsant cbz along the reaches of the rivers alb rhine and elbe in germany each graph includes the pearson correlation coefficient r as a measure of the linear correlation between the sulfamate and cbz concentrations of the respective surface water cbz was chosen as it is a proven persistent indicator for detecting domestic wastewater in waterbodies warner et al 2019 samples of the alb river taken near its headwater in the northern black forest sampling points 1 and 2 and at downstream rural reaches sampling points 3 to 6 had sulfamate concentrations below or close to the loq of 0 5 μg l cbz concentrations were below its loq of 10 ng l in samples from sites 1 to 6 both sulfamate and cbz showed a substantial increase in concentration at sampling site 7 site 6 and 7 correspond to river stretches before and after the point of discharge from a municipal wwtp 40 000 pe respectively fig 1 the subsequent decrease in the sulfamate and cbz concentrations between site 7 and site 10 can be explained by dilution from alb river tributaries a substantial increase in concentration of both compounds was again observed downstream the outfall of a second municipal wwtp 875 000 pe fig 1 the very strong positive correlation r 0 99 p 0 001 between sulfamate and the wastewater indicator cbz indicates that the predominant source of sulfamate in the alb river are municipal wwtp effluents furthermore sulfamate concentrations in samples from the upper reaches of the alb with minor anthropogenic influence are considerably lower compared to samples from urbanized locations downstream up to 130 μg l a similar picture was obtained for the much larger watershed of the rhine river where changes in the sulfamate concentration were again congruent with changes in the cbz concentration one exception however was sampling point 4a on the left bank of the rhine where a commonly observed cbz concentration of 20 ng l but an elevated sulfamate concentration of 112 μg l was found this can possibly be explained by a relatively high discharge of sulfamate upstream near ludwigshafen a city hosting major chemical industries schlüsener et al 2015 in contrast at sampling point 4b which is located at the same rhine km as sampling point 4a but on the right instead of the left river bank side the sulfamate concentration was much lower with 46 μg l cbz 24 ng l this indicates that industrial discharges may also contribute considerably to the sulfamate budget of surface waters excluding sampling point 4a from the correlation the r between the sulfamate and cbz concentrations for the rhine was 0 91 p 0 001 the graph further shows a general increase in the sulfamate and cbz concentrations in downstream direction which reflects the increase in the effluent fraction of the river from the upper rhine to the lower rhine according to drewes et al 2018 the effluent fraction of the rhine under average flow conditions raises from 5 to 5 10 after the confluence of the neckar river the collection of 24 h composite samples from the rhine at koblenz rhine km 590 3 over the course of 23 consecutive days in march 2017 revealed a similar concentration curve compared to cbz which further supports the assumption that the main proportion of sulfamate in the rhine at this location originates from municipal wastewater rather than from industrial wastewater or diffuse sources data on the discharge of the rhine were available and allowed calculating the daily load of sulfamate during this sampling period of about 3 weeks the average load at koblenz was 10 6 1 9 t d which highlights the high emissions of sulfamate compared to other pollutants such as pharmaceuticals for example the average daily load of cbz during the same period was about 2500 times lower 0 0042 0 00091 t d sulfamate concentrations for the elbe river ranged from 8 9 μg l to 144 μg l a weaker correlation between the concentrations of sulfamate and cbz was found for the elbe river r 0 79 p 0 001 this could indicate a generally stronger influence of industrial discharges of sulfamate in the elbe river compared to the rhine river for the sampling conducted in the state of lower saxony sulfamate concentration ranged from 0 5 μg l to 580 μg l with a median of 31 μg l data not shown the correlation between sulfamate and cbz was weaker r 0 77 p 0 001 however the regression was heavily influenced by the leverage of the data points from two sampling sites which had exceptionally high concentrations of sulfamate 420 μg l and 480 μg l but common concentrations of cbz 140 ng l and 170 ng l without those two outliers the r was 0 91 all three of the sampled lakes showed sulfamate and cbz concentrations below or just above their respective loqs in germany streams in or downstream of urban areas as well as streams with low discharge typically contain between 5 and 20 of effluent under average flow conditions drewes et al 2018 since municipal wwtp effluent concentrations of sulfamate in germany are typically in the high μg l range see 3 1 it is reasonable to assume that for most wastewater impacted surface waters in germany the introduction of sulfamate by diffuse sources atmospheric deposition is greatly exceeded by wwtp effluents these findings are in contrast to the results obtained by van stempvoort et al 2019 in their study the authors assumed that sulfamate detected in environmental water samples from ontario canada was mostly originating from non wastewater sources it has to be noted that the cited study also included precipitation samples and a great number of samples from ground and surface waters with no or minor influence of wastewater more than 75 of the sampled surface waters in canada had a sulfamate concentration 2 μg l which could also indicate a generally lower wastewater influence on waterbodies in canada compared to germany 3 3 removal during drinking water production and occurrence in potable water in 5 of the 7 sampled drinking water samples sulfamate was detected in a concentration range of 1 7 μg l to 140 μg l the comparison of the sulfamate concentration of raw and finished drinking water at seven drinking water treatment plants dwtps suggests that sulfamate is not removed by oxidative treatment techniques further the results show that gac filtration is also inappropriate for sulfamate removal table 1 the correlation r 0 71 p 0 002 between sulfamate and cbz of samples from a dwtp using bank filtration located adjacent to the rhine river dwtp 8 was weaker compared to the surface waters analyzed in this study this could indicate biological degradation of sulfamate in the aquifer since cbz is not susceptible to biodegradation under the prevailing aerobic conditions average dissolved oxygen concentration in groundwater samples 5 5 1 1 mg l a substantial decrease 61 in the dilution corrected sulfamate concentration based on the cbz was observed between the raw water rhine 41 μg l and the water from the extraction well 16 μg l fig 4 the spatial sampling revealed a heterogeneous picture of sulfamate concentrations in the aquifer the lowest dilution corrected sulfamate concentration in well a 9 8 μg l was found at the highest well depths with the exception of well d the lowest dilution corrected concentration at the other observation points was always found at the middle depth of the well according to the operator of the water utility these findings are plausible and can be explained by different microstates specifically the heterogeneous distribution of flow velocities and directions in the aquifer therefore the retention times at the different wells well depths can vary considerably the elevated sulfamate concentrations in the landward groundwater can be explained by the fact that landward groundwater at the site is heavily influenced by the rhine under high flow conditions an even more pronounced removal of sulfamate was observed at two additional dtwps which are also situated adjacent to the rhine and use bank filtration as an additional treatment step again dilution corrected sulfamate concentrations were calculated based on the cbz concentrations of the respective samples on average dilution corrected sulfamate concentrations decreased by 82 and 99 during aquifer passage at dwtp 9 and dwtp 10 respectively table 2 due to the spatial proximity and the similar hydrogeological settings at the two sites differences in the removal of sulfamate are possibly explained by differences in the average residence time average residence time at dwtp 10 is about ten days longer than at dwtp 9 similar high removal was observed at a different bank filtration site which is operated with water from a wastewater impacted lake dwtp 11 during the sampling campaign conducted in june 2006 78 μg l of sulfamate were measured in the lake while concentrations were 1 μg l in the samples from two observation wells retention time 1 3 months sulfamate concentrations in the two observation wells were again 1 μg l in august 2018 the site is characterized by a transition from anoxic nitrate reducing to anaerobic iron and manganese reducing conditions in the summer months the results from these full scale bank filtration sites indicate that sulfamate is degraded during aquifer passage under aerobic and anaerobic conditions the fact that only bank filtration proved to be effective for the attenuation of sulfamate highlights the very importance of bank filtration within the multi barrier approach in water treatment 3 4 chemical degradability of sulfamate typical ozone doses in germany used for ozonation and disinfection purposes during drinking water production are between 0 5 mg l and 1 5 mg l sulfamate proved to be persistent during ozonation under these conditions removal 10 after 30 min at an initial ozone dose of 5 mg l according to the list of treatment agents and disinfection procedures pursuant to section 11 of the drinking water ordinance 2001 the maximum initial concentration of free chlorine for disinfection purposes in germany is 1 2 mg l dvgw 2018 over the course of one day no degradation of sulfamate was observed in drinking water when treated with an initial chlorine dose of 1 mg l fig s3 therefore sulfamate can be considered to be stable in drinking water when treated with realistic contact times and doses of the tested oxidizing agents this is further supported by the results obtained from the monitoring at full scale dwtps see 3 3 3 5 biological degradability of sulfamate in water sediment studies and natural attenuation both under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions a clear decrease of the initial sulfamate concentration c0 410 μg l was observed in contrast no considerable change of concentrations was observed in the autoclaved samples this strongly indicates a biologically mediated degradation of sulfamate under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions the almost linear decrease of concentrations indicated a degradation according to zero order kinetics degradation under anaerobic conditions was slightly but statistically significantly p 0 001 faster calculated t1 2 8 5 0 1 d than under aerobic conditions calculated t1 2 12 2 0 5 d fig 5 these results indicated that in general sulfamate is susceptible to biological degradation under a broad range of redox conditions this is in accordance with the substantial decrease in the dilution corrected sulfamate concentrations observed at several bank filtration sites see 3 3 in contrast the investigation of the natural attenuation of sulfamate in the small river usa located north of frankfurt main in hesse revealed no substantial removal along two river sections of about 7 5 km each fig s4 shows the normalized relative concentrations of sulfamate along both river sections for this the sulfamate concentration at each sampling point was normalized by the respective concentration of cbz to compensate for possible dilution and was then divided by the normalized sulfamate concentration at sampling point a no removal of sulfamate was observed on the first river stretch between a and b on the second stretch between c and d a minor even though statistically significant p 0 05 reduction by about 15 was found however considering the limited residence time of about 1 d for each river stretch a minor attenuation by biological degradation processes is in accordance with the results from batch experiments revealing a half live in the range of several days a minor attenuation of sulfamate in rivers and streams due the limited residence time and the constant discharge at multiple points by wwtps is also supported by the strong correlation of sulfamate and cbz concentrations discussed above 3 2 3 6 formation of sulfamate by biological degradation of potential precursors cyc and sac showed a similar degradation pattern in the zahn wellens test during the first 44 h of the test degradation of the precursors was slow within the following 72 h a much faster degradation of both precursors was observed and concentrations were just above the loq cyc and below the loq sac after 116 h although both artificial sweeteners were completely degraded in the test sulfamate formation was only minor with a molar yield after 14 d of 0 1 and 0 6 for sac and cyc respectively fig 6 even at the end of the test after 28 d of exposure of the precursors to the activated sludge sulfamate concentrations were still very low with a molar sulfamate yield of 0 2 and 0 7 for sac and cyc respectively these results suggest that the presence of sac and cyc in wwtp influents and their subsequent biological degradation do not substantially contribute to the sulfamate load discharged by a wwtp even if the typical concentrations of these precursors in wwtp influents can be in the μg l range 3 7 formation of sulfamate by chemical degradation of potential precursors fig 7 depicts the concentration profiles of potential sulfamate precursors and sulfamate in the ozonation experiments at an ozone dose of 0 5 mg l and an exposure time of 60 min the concentration of ace was reduced to about 20 of its initial value at an ozone dose of 5 mg l ace was decreased by 98 within the first 5 min of exposure in contrast cyc and sac showed slower degradation kinetics with ozone at an ozone dose of 0 5 mg l and an exposure time of 60 min cyc and sac concentrations only decreased to about 80 of their initial values at the higher ozone dose of 5 mg l and an exposure time of 60 min cyc and sac concentrations decreased to 2 and 30 of their initial value respectively fig 7 the overall higher removal rate of ace compared to cyc is in accordance to the findings of an earlier study and can be explained by the presence of a cc double bond in ace which is known to be easily cleaved by ozone according to the criegee mechanism scheurer et al 2012 rapid removal was also found for top whose concentration decreased to 1 of its initial value at an ozone dose of 0 5 mg l and an exposure time of 60 min the fastest reduction of the initial concentration was observed for hct which was completely removed under both ozone doses within the first 5 min of exposure fig 7 a very high reactivity of hct to ozone was also observed in a study conducted by borowska et al 2016 the formation of sulfamate from the degradation of the respective precursors differed considerably after 60 min and an ozone dose of 5 mg l most sulfamate formed on a molar base was from ace 56 in fact ace was nearly completely transformed after 5 min of contact to the ozone the steady increase of sulfamate over the course of the test indicated that intermediates were formed which were further oxidized to sulfamate for cyc a molar yield 35 was reached at an ozone dose of 5 mg l at the end of the experiment sac was the artificial sweetener which not only showed the highest stability to ozone but also had the lowest molar yield of sulfamate 14 at 5 mg l o3 although hct was already completely degraded after 5 min of contact time in the batch with 0 5 mg l and 5 mg l ozone sulfamate formation was only minor with molar yields of 5 and 16 respectively using non target screening borowska et al 2016 identified eight ozonation products of hct with chlorothiazide being the main ozone transformation product however sulfamate was not identified in the aforementioned study this can be explained by their usage of a c18 reversed phase lc column these columns generally do not provide sufficient retention of inorganic and very polar analytes such as sulfamate based on the results obtained for hct it is likely that other compounds containing a sulfonamide moiety are sulfamate precursors as well this is especially relevant as some sulfonamide drugs including the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole and the beta blocker sotalol are commonly present in raw waters used for drinking water production chauveheid and scholdis 2019 willach et al 2017 the lowest molar sulfamate yield of all tested compounds was found for top 3 despite its very fast removal at an ozone dose of 5 mg l fig 7 scheurer et al 2010 studied the performance of multi barrier dwtps for the removal of four artificial sweeteners sac and cyc were present in samples from the rhine which is used as a raw water source for drinking water production at concentrations between 0 03 and 0 18 μg l in contrast ace was found at concentrations 2 μg l in raw waters in the same study no reported concentrations of hct and top in raw water resources in germany could be found however an average concentration of 0 67 μg l of hct was reported for a raw water resource in spain used for drinking water production huerta fontela et al 2011 thus due to the generally high background concentration of sulfamate in tested raw waters see 3 3 it is not clear whether typical loads of potentially present precursors can substantially contribute to the sulfamate balance of a dwtp nevertheless the batch experiments confirm that sulfamate can be formed with highly compound specific yields through ozonation of precursors during drinking water production this is of particular relevance due to the highly mobile and persistent nature of sulfamate and the potentially high number of parent compounds of sulfamate additional studies are needed to get a better understanding which chemical moieties structures determine the potential of a substance to form sulfamate through degradation ozonation also finds increasing application in wastewater treatment as an advanced treatment step for the removal of micropollutants or disinfection purposes however no significant differences in the sulfamate concentration of the ozonated wwtp influent and effluent samples were observed fig s5 in summary the transformation of precursors to sulfamate in wwtps and in wastewater impacted water bodies can be considered to be quantitatively irrelevant due to the already very high concentrations of sulfamate in these compartments in germany subsequent studies are needed elucidate the relevance of different sources of sulfamate in other regions 3 8 eco toxicological relevance about 30 of all studied ground and surface water samples showed an rq 1 thus adverse effects of sulfamate on the aquatic ecosystem of wastewater impacted waterbodies in germany cannot be excluded the highest environmental concentration of sulfamate observed in this study was 580 μg l which is more than eight times the derived pnec 70 μg l text s4 it has to be noted that using an af of 1000 on short term toxicity data is a conservative approach and additional ecotoxicology testing should be conducted to allow for a better assessment of potential risk linked to the exposure of the aquatic ecosystem to sulfamate since sulfamate concentrations in wwtp effluents were as high as 1 6 mg l see 3 1 the concentrations of receiving waters with high proportions of effluent or even effluent dependent streams paretti et al 2019 should be further investigated in subsequent studies to assess the risk to human health a gv for sulfamate was derived based on the noael of 1000 mg kg bw d reported in a feeding study on rats with 90 d exposure period the noael value from this specific study was selected as it was considered to be the best subchronic toxicity study available to calculate the derived no effect level dnel for long term exposure by the european chemicals agency echa 2019 by multiplying the afs for intraspecific variability af 10 interspecific variability af 10 and for extrapolation from subchronic to chronic exposure af 10 an overall af of 1000 was obtained based on a noael of 1000 mg kg bw d and an overall af of 1000 a tdi of 1000 μg kg bw was calculated assuming an average body weight of 60 kg a daily drinking water consumption of 2 l and an allocation of 20 a gv for sulfamate of 6 mg l was derived the highest drinking water concentration of sulfamate observed in this study was 140 μg l which is about 42 times lower than the gv indicating that current sulfamate concentrations in drinking water in germany do not represent any significant risk to human health over a lifetime of consumption further it has to be noted that sa is listed by the united states food and drug administration fda as a substance added indirectly to human food affirmed as generally recognized as safe gras ghazala 2003 however from the standpoint of drinking water hygiene and following the precautionary principle sulfamate concentrations in drinking water should be kept as low as reasonably practicable 4 conclusions sulfamate is ubiquitously present in wwtp effluents as well as in wastewater impacted water bodies in germany the predominant source of sulfamate in major surface waters in germany is wwtp effluent potential atmospheric deposition of sulfamate only plays a minor role in the general sulfamate budget of the urban water cycle ozonation and activated sludge experiments proved that sulfamate can be formed to different extents from chemical and biological degradation of various precursors however the transformation of precursors to sulfamate in wwtps and in wastewater impacted water bodies was found to be quantitatively irrelevant due to the already very high concentrations of sulfamate in these compartments in germany commonly applied treatment techniques in waterworks are not capable to remove sulfamate the results from biological degradation tests and from the analysis of samples taken at a bank filtration site indicate that sulfamate is removed to some extent in the sediment water interface of aquatic systems and during aquifer passage under aerobic and anaerobic conditions a conservative risk quotient based analysis indicates that effects of sulfamate to aquatic organisms in wastewater impacted waterbodies in germany cannot be excluded so far the calculation of a health based guide value for sulfamate portents that current sulfamate concentrations in drinking water in germany do not represent any

18028,elevated concentrations of sulfamate the anion of sulfamic acid were found in surface waters and finished drinking water in germany with concentrations up to 580 μg l and 140 μg l respectively wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent was identified as the dominant source of sulfamate in the urban water cycle as sulfamate concentrations correlated positively 0 77 r 0 99 with concentrations of the wastewater tracer carbamazepine in samples from different waterbodies ozonation and activated sludge experiments proved that sulfamate can be formed from chemical and biological degradation of various precursors molar sulfamate yields were highly compound specific and ranged from 2 to 56 however the transformation of precursors to sulfamate in wwtps and wastewater impacted waterbodies was found to be quantitatively irrelevant since concentrations of sulfamate in these compartments are already high presumably due to its primary use as an acidic cleaning agent sulfamate concentrations in the influent and effluent of studied wwtps ranged from 520 μg l to 1900 μg l and from 490 μg l to 1600 μg l respectively laboratory batch experiments were performed to assess the recalcitrance of sulfamate for chemical oxidation in combination with the results from sampling conducted at full scale waterworks it was shown that common drinking water treatment techniques including ozonation and filtration with activated carbon are not capable to remove sulfamate the results of biodegradation tests and from the analysis of samples taken at four bank filtration sites indicate that sulfamate is attenuated in the sediment water interface of aquatic systems and during aquifer passage under aerobic and anaerobic conditions sulfamate concentrations decreased by between 62 and 99 during aquifer passage at the bank filtration sites considering the few data on short term ecotoxicity about 30 of the presented sulfamate levels in ground and surface water samples did exceed the predicted no effect concentration pnec of sulfamate and thus effects of sulfamate on the aquatic ecosystem of wastewater impacted waterbodies in germany cannot be excluded so far toxicological estimations suggest that no risk to human health is expected by concentrations of sulfamate typically encountered in tap water keywords micropollutants sulfamic acid sulfamate urban water cycle formation potential 1 introduction sulfamic acid sa chemical formula h3no3s is a high production volume chemical hpvc which is widely used for scale removal operations and chemical cleaning due to several advantageous properties including its ability to form highly water soluble compounds with most deposits and its considerably lower corrosivity in comparison to other acids such as sulfuric and hydrochloric acid furthermore it is compatible with corrosion inhibitors ph indicators and wetting agents motamedi et al 2013 yoshikubo and suzuki 2000 consequently sa is used in a wide variety of household and industrial applications for example in desalination plants shkir et al 2013 cooling systems videla 2002 and food processing such as in the dairy industry mcelhatton and marshall 2007 being an inexpensive stable odorless non toxic non volatile non hygroscopic and non corrosive chemical sa has recently emerged as a cost effective and green catalyst for organic synthesis oliveira et al 2016 yahya et al 2016 it is also used in pulp bleaching suess 2010 in superplasticizers zhang et al 2016 in disinfectants for livestock farming hancox et al 2013 and in acidizing treatments of oil and gas bearing rock formations to increase the flow rate of oil or gas out of production wells or the flow rate of oil displacing fluids into injection wells speight 2017 moreover sa is a precursor in the production of the artificial sweeteners sodium cyclamate cyc metzger 2000 and acesulfame potassium ace haber et al 2006 o substituted n substituted or di tri substituted derivatives of sa sulfamates showed attractive possibilities for the drug design of various pharmacological agents such as hiv protease inhibitors and anti cancer drugs winum et al 2005 and have been discussed as a novel class of metal extractants and as super acidic ionic liquids dupont et al 2016 metal sulfamate salts are highly soluble due to the zwitterionic nature of sa and therefore are commonly used in electroplating aruna et al 2014 ammonium sulfamate is utilized in non intumescent coating products for wood ryszard and małgorzata 2016 and textile schindler and hauser 2004 protection due to its numerous applications sa is manufactured in high quantities for the united states national aggregate production volumes were between 4500 and 22 700 t in 2015 epa 2019 according to the european chemical agency echa sa is manufactured and or imported in the european union with 10 000 100 000 t per year echa 2019 for china an online database of chemical suppliers currently lists more than 50 manufacturers and suppliers of sa most of them with an annual production capacity greater than 50 000 metric tons made in china com 2019 as a result of its negative charge pk a 1 benson and spillane 1980 sa occurs in its anionic form sulfamate nh2so3 table s1 in water under environmentally relevant conditions hence the term sulfamate is used in the following since sa and its salts are used in considerable amounts it can be expected that high loads of sulfamate reach wastewater treatment plants wwtps in fact preliminary measurements in three german wwtps revealed that sulfamate concentrations in raw and treated wastewater can reach up to 2 mg l castronovo et al 2017 and thus are much higher than those of most other anthropogenic micropollutants detected in wastewater so far moreover previous results showed that sulfamate can also be formed by biological degradation castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 photodegradation sang et al 2014 scheurer et al 2014 chlorination li et al 2017 and ozonation buchner et al 2019 of ace furthermore sulfamate was identified as one of the oxidation products of cyc during ozonation scheurer et al 2012 it was found that sulfamate can also be a degradation product of topiramate top a sulfamate substituted monosaccharide when heated 70 c li and rossi 1995 surprisingly to the best of our knowledge sulfonamide containing drugs have not been tested yet for their sulfamate formation potential despite the fact that the sulfonamide functional group is the basis of numerous classes of drugs some of these drugs including the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide hct are widely detected in raw waters used for drinking water production huerta fontela et al 2011 in general little is known to what extent sulfamate can be released from the degradation of potential precursors this is especially relevant as studies have shown the potential of precursors present in drinking water and wastewater to form small and mobile transformation products such as trifluoroacetate scheurer et al 2017 and n nitrosodimethylamine schmidt and brauch 2008 during water treatment the existence of diffuse sources of sulfamate was also discussed in some studies ammonia nh3 may interact with sulfur trioxide so3 in the atmosphere to form sa atmospheric nh3 results from animal wastes fertilizers and vehicle and industrial emissions pawlowski et al 2003 atmospheric so3 is mainly formed in the atmosphere by gas phase oxidation of sulfur dioxide so2 the hydrolysis of so3 has been generally considered as the dominant pathway for the loss of so3 due to the high concentration levels of water in the troposphere however in dry and heavily polluted areas with high concentrations of nh3 ammonolysis of so3 may also be a relevant formation pathway of sa li et al 2018a sarkar et al 2019 due to its high polarity sulfamate is considered to be highly mobile in the aquatic system moreover results of the study conducted by notley 1973 indicate that sulfamate is not susceptible to hydrolysis under environmentally relevant conditions castronovo et al 2017 found that sulfamate is not removed during biological wastewater treatment and stated that sulfamate might be a promising conservative wastewater tracer thus due its high mobility and persistence sulfamate might be ubiquitously present in wastewater impacted surface water and prone to reach drinking water resources sulfamate was already widely detected with concentrations up to 128 μg l in environmental waters in ontario canada concentrations were always 0 1 μg l in bulk precipitation samples and streams and sulfamate was also commonly found in groundwater the authors of the study concluded that both widespread atmospheric deposition and localized land based anthropogenic sources of sulfamate may be relevant van stempvoort et al 2019 however so far information on the persistence of sulfamate in the aquatic environment and during drinking water treatment is scarce and to the best of our knowledge the occurrence of sulfamate in bank filtrate and drinking water has not been reported yet this might be to some extent explained by the fact that prioritization approaches often focus on organic micropollutants and that due to its high polarity sulfamate is not amenable to common routine methods based on reversed phase liquid chromatography rp lc coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ms ms seitz et al 2018 similarly also non target approaches which have recently been successfully applied for the identification of so far unknown micropollutants by lc coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry hrms mainly use rp columns for chromatographic separation and often routinely exclude compounds with masses below 100 da such as sulfamate the aim of the current study was i to elucidate the occurrence of sulfamate in various compartments of the urban water cycle including wwtps surface waters bank filtrate and finished drinking water ii to assess the recalcitrance of sulfamate for chemical oxidation in laboratory batch experiments and iii to evaluate the biological degradation at different redox conditions in laboratory batch experiments a further focus was iv on the investigation to what extent sulfamate can be formed from potential precursors by biological degradation or ozonation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals methanol meoh 99 9 and acetonitrile acn 99 9

environmental samples 2 3 sampling sites and protocol 2 3 1 wastewater treatment plants over the course of five consecutive days 24 h flow proportional composite samples of the influent i e raw sewage and treated effluent from a conventional wwtp i e conventional activated sludge system were taken to test the hypothesis whether wastewater can bear a sulfamate formation potential three day n 2 and seven day n 3 composite samples of influents and effluents were additionally collected at five conventional wwtps wwtp 1 wwtp 5 to evaluate whether wwtps equipped with an activated carbon treatment process are capable to remove sulfamate three consecutive 24 h composite samples were collected from the influent after primary clarifier and the effluent after activated carbon treatment and sand filtration of two additional wwtps wwtp 6 wwtp 7 wwtp 6 uses powdered activated carbon pac followed by sand filtration post treatment of the wwtp 7 consists of 4 parallel sand and 2 granulated activated carbon gac units the wwtps analyzed in this study have a capacity between 31 350 and 875 000 population equivalents pe and are all located in germany with the exception of the wwtp 7 which is situated in switzerland all wastewater samples were stored either in 50 ml polypropylene pp centrifugal tubes or in amber glass bottles at 4 c until analysis 2 3 2 surface waters water samples from 13 different sampling locations along the rhine river were taken between the 21st and the 29th of march 2017 samples were collected using 1 l amber glass bottles as 7 day composite samples by automatic sampling devices except for the sampling locations 5 and 10 where grab samples were taken manually all samples from the river rhine were stored in 1 l amber glass bottles samples from the alb river n 11 were taken on the 22nd of september 2017 as grab samples using 15 ml pp centrifugal tubes samples along the elbe river n 25 were taken from a depth of 50 cm below the water surface using a submersible pump between the 24th of june 2017 and the 12th of july 2017 and were stored in 15 ml pp centrifugal tubes additionally 55 discrete samples were collected on the 12th of november 2018 from various surface waters in the state of lower saxony germany fig 1 while for the alb elbe and rhine samples were collected along the longitudinal profile of the respective river sampling in lower saxony was designed to represent a variety of hydrologically independent surface waters including three lakes all of the samples were stored at 4 c for 1 month until analysis to determine fluxes of sulfamate in a major stream 24 h composite samples were taken from the rhine at koblenz fig 1 sampling point 7 between the 4th and the 26th of march 2017 these samples were stored frozen in 15 ml pp centrifugal tubes for 12 months until analysis to elucidate potential natural attenuation of sulfamate during river flow samples were taken at 4 locations along a segment of the usa river in hesse germany downstream of a conventional wwtp 49 000 pe on three consecutive days in july 2016 the river usa can be characterized as a small siliceous mountain brook and the average discharge at the time of sampling was approximately 0 1 m³ s at sampling location a and 0 2 m³ s at sampling locations c and d respectively to account for the compound load from a small tributary the sampling points b and c were located directly upstream and downstream of the mouth of the creek respectively sampling point d was located upstream of the next wwtp the distance between sampling locations a and b and c and d was about 7 7 and 7 5 km respectively fig s1 at each sampling location three consecutive 24 h time proportional composite samples were taken using automatic sampling devices these samples were stored frozen in 15 ml pp centrifugal tubes for 12 months until analysis based on the estimated retention time sampling at location b and c started with a delay of 1 d and at location d with a delay

waterworks encompass a variety of drinking water treatment techniques table 1 dwtp 1 dwtp 7 sampling was also conducted at three bank filtration sites adjacent to the rhine river in april 2019 dwtp 8 and in august and september 2019 dwtp 9 and 10 the average retention time from the river to the abstraction well at dwtp 8 dwtp 9 and dwtp 10 is approx 24 d 25 d and 35 d respectively additional samples were taken at a bank filtration site which is operated with water from a wastewater impacted lake in june 2016 and in august 2018 dwtp 11 the retention time from the lake to the sampled observation wells is between 1 and 3 months samples at a specific water utility were taken on the same day and stored in amber glass bottles at 4 c until analysis 1 week 2 4 chemical degradability of sulfamate ozonation c0 49 μg l sulfamate and chlorination c0 9 9 μg l sulfamate batch experiments were conducted in 500 ml glass bottles using local tap water the tap water had a ph of 7 4 a hydrogencarbonate concentration of 322 mg l a dissolved organic carbon content doc of 0 9 mg l an acid neutralizing capacity to ph 4 3 of 5 32 mmol l and a base neutralizing capacity to ph 8 2 of 0 66 mmol l two concentrations of ozone 0 5 and 5 mg l were applied by adding defined volumes of an ozone stock solution approx 25 mg l after defined contact times between 5 min and 60 min 10 ml aliquots were taken from the 500 ml bottle and residual ozone was reduced by the addition of 200 μl of a sodium thiosulfate solution 1 65 g l two concentrations of chlorine 0 2 and 1 mg l were applied by adding a defined volume of a hypochlorite stock solution approx 1 g l after defined contact times between 10 min and 24 h 10 ml aliquots were taken from the 500 ml bottles and residual chlorine was reduced by the addition of 140 μl and 700 μl of a sodium thiosulfate solution 0 7 g l for the low and high chlorine concentration respectively 2 5 biological degradability of sulfamate in sediment water studies degradation of sulfamate in contact with river sediment was assessed by lab experiments according to oecd 308 oecd 2002 amber glass bottles were filled with 100 g fresh sediment and 400 ml water taken from the river rhine in the harbor area of koblenz ehrenbreitstein rhine km 591 4 after an equilibration time of 2 weeks at 22 c the batches were spiked with 400 μg l sulfamate and degradation was studied for a period of 30 d three bottles were constantly aerated throughout the whole incubation to establish oxic conditions to study the persistence of sulfamate also under anaerobic conditions three more bottles were flushed vigorously with argon gas for 30 min and the bottles were sealed with ptfe lined butyl rubber seals anaerobic conditions were confirmed by measuring the redox potentials as well as concentrations of fe ii sulfate and or sulfide during the experiments in addition sterile controls were prepared by autoclaving twice for 20 min at 121 c and were also incubated under aerobic ambient air n 3 and anaerobic argon atmosphere n 3 conditions to examine the abiotic degradation of sulfamate samples were stored frozen at 22 c for 1 month until analysis 2 6 formation of sulfamate by biological degradation of potential precursors in activated sludge the biological degradation of two potential precursors cyc and sac was investigated by conducting a modified oecd guideline 302 b zahn wellens test oecd 1992 cyc and sac were selected as they are typically present in high concentrations in wwtp influent li et al 2018b scheurer et al 2009 and contain a sulfamate and a sulfonamide moiety respectively the preparation of the sewage sludge the verification of the biological activity of the washed sludge and the overall test setup are described in detail in an earlier study scheurer et al 2017 the sludge was collected from a wwtp that showed based on the results of a t test no significant difference α 0 05 between the daily mean sulfamate concentrations in the influent and the effluent over a 5 day period data not shown hence the experiment was based on the assumption that sulfamate itself was stable in the zahn wellens test the test batches for the precursors were each prepared in triplicates and were spiked with an aqueous solution of the potential precursor to obtain a final concentration of 10 mg l precursor samples were collected 0 h 20 h 44 h 71 5 h 116 h 211 h and 334 h after the start of the test evaporation losses from the test bottles were determined by weighting the batches and were compensated before each sampling by adding ultrapure water samples were immediately centrifuged and the supernatant was frozen until analysis 2 7 formation of sulfamate by chemical degradation of potential precursors to study the sulfamate evolution potential of possible precursors by ozonation individual solutions of three artificial sweeteners ace cyc sac the diuretic hct and the anticonvulsant top were treated with ozone hct was selected for the experiment as a representative of sulfonamide drugs the sulfamate formation potential of top was tested since its use as an anti obesity drug is forecasted to grow rapidly in the coming years bloomberg 2019 a concentration of 100 μg l of the potential precursor was applied individually in tap water in 500 ml brown glass bottles and two different ozone dosages 0 5 mg l and 5 mg l were used by adding a defined volume of an ozone stock solution the experiments were conducted using the same water matrix as described in 2 4 table s8 depicts the chemical structures of the predominant species of each precursor at ph 7 4 aliquots 50 ml were taken after contact times between 5 min and 60 min and residual ozone was reduced by adding 1 ml of a sodium thiosulfate solution 1 65 g l the ph of the tap water of each glass bottle was measured again at the end of the experiment to assess the potential of sulfamate formation from the ozonation of wastewater influent and corresponding effluent samples from five wwtps either three day or seven day composite samples were treated with different amounts of the aqueous ozone stock solution this experimental setup was conducted with both filtered and native wastewater samples to elucidate if potential precursors are mainly present in the aqueous phase or adsorbed onto particles an initial dose of 0 5 mg ozone per mg doc toc was chosen as 0 5 mg ozone per mg doc is recommended as the maximum dose for the ozonation of wwtp effluents to prevent the formation of bromate lee et al 2016 therefore doc and toc concentrations of all influent and effluent samples were measured prior to ozonation 2 8 eco toxicological relevance to estimate the ecotoxicological risk linked to the exposure of the aquatic ecosystem to sulfamate a risk quotient rq was determined according to the guideline of the european commission ec 2003 as the quotient between the measured environmental concentration mec of individual surface and groundwater samples and the predicted no effect concentration pnec for sulfamate rqs 1 indicate potential risk to aquatic organisms on the contrary if the rq value is below unity adverse effects are not likely to occur the derivation of the pnec for sulfamate is described in text s4 to qualify the risk to human health a guideline value gv for sulfamate was derived according to the world health organization s who guidance who 2011 the gv for a substance is the concentration in drinking water that is tolerable for lifelong consumption based on the daily drinking water consumption and the age dependent body weight it is calculated as gv tdi bw p c where tdi is the tolerable daily intake bw is the body weight p is the fraction of the tdi allocated to drinking water and c is the daily drinking water consumption the tdi is derived as follows tdi noael af where noael is the no observed adverse effect level and af is the assessment factor 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal during wastewater treatment and occurrence in wwtp effluent the statistical evaluation of influent and effluent concentrations of the conventional wwtps fig 2 wwtp 1 5 supports the findings of castronovo et al 2017 that sulfamate is rather stable in contact with activated sludge moreover no statistically significant α 0 05 change in the sulfamate concentration was observed for the two wwtps which were equipped with an activated carbon treatment step fig 2 wwtp 6 and 7 this is in accordance with the high polarity and negative charge of sulfamate which limits a removal by sorption processes furthermore the daily sampling over five consecutive days monday to friday at one wwtp revealed that sulfamate concentrations in the influent and effluent remain rather constant 62 5 kg of sulfamate per day were released by this wwtp 875 000 pe sulfamate concentrations in the influent and effluent of the studied wwtps ranged from 520 μg l to 1900 μg l and from 490 μg l to 1600 μg l respectively this means that typical sulfamate concentrations in wwtp effluent in germany are more than 1000 times higher than the effluent concentrations of the commonly used pharmaceuticals cbz and diclofenac which are generally detected in the mid ng l range margot et al 2015 the sulfamate concentrations in this study are in the same range as previously reported for three other german wwtps castronovo et al 2017 interestingly much lower sulfamate effluent concentrations were recently reported for 14 municipal wwtps across canada van stempvoort et al 2019 where sulfamate concentrations ranged from approx 11 μg l to 720 μg l average 77 μg l since this dissimilarity cannot solely be explained by differences in the per capita drinking water consumption dilution effects or by differences in the overall hardness of drinking water resources of the two countries it is likely that sulfamate is used in much higher per capita quantities in germany compared to canada 3 2 occurrence and main sources of sulfamate in surface waters fig 3 depicts the concentrations of sulfamate and the anticonvulsant cbz along the reaches of the rivers alb rhine and elbe in germany each graph includes the pearson correlation coefficient r as a measure of the linear correlation between the sulfamate and cbz concentrations of the respective surface water cbz was chosen as it is a proven persistent indicator for detecting domestic wastewater in waterbodies warner et al 2019 samples of the alb river taken near its headwater in the northern black forest sampling points 1 and 2 and at downstream rural reaches sampling points 3 to 6 had sulfamate concentrations below or close to the loq of 0 5 μg l cbz concentrations were below its loq of 10 ng l in samples from sites 1 to 6 both sulfamate and cbz showed a substantial increase in concentration at sampling site 7 site 6 and 7 correspond to river stretches before and after the point of discharge from a municipal wwtp 40 000 pe respectively fig 1 the subsequent decrease in the sulfamate and cbz concentrations between site 7 and site 10 can be explained by dilution from alb river tributaries a substantial increase in concentration of both compounds was again observed downstream the outfall of a second municipal wwtp 875 000 pe fig 1 the very strong positive correlation r 0 99 p 0 001 between sulfamate and the wastewater indicator cbz indicates that the predominant source of sulfamate in the alb river are municipal wwtp effluents furthermore sulfamate concentrations in samples from the upper reaches of the alb with minor anthropogenic influence are considerably lower compared to samples from urbanized locations downstream up to 130 μg l a similar picture was obtained for the much larger watershed of the rhine river where changes in the sulfamate concentration were again congruent with changes in the cbz concentration one exception however was sampling point 4a on the left bank of the rhine where a commonly observed cbz concentration of 20 ng l but an elevated sulfamate concentration of 112 μg l was found this can possibly be explained by a relatively high discharge of sulfamate upstream near ludwigshafen a city hosting major chemical industries schlüsener et al 2015 in contrast at sampling point 4b which is located at the same rhine km as sampling point 4a but on the right instead of the left river bank side the sulfamate concentration was much lower with 46 μg l cbz 24 ng l this indicates that industrial discharges may also contribute considerably to the sulfamate budget of surface waters excluding sampling point 4a from the correlation the r between the sulfamate and cbz concentrations for the rhine was 0 91 p 0 001 the graph further shows a general increase in the sulfamate and cbz concentrations in downstream direction which reflects the increase in the effluent fraction of the river from the upper rhine to the lower rhine according to drewes et al 2018 the effluent fraction of the rhine under average flow conditions raises from 5 to 5 10 after the confluence of the neckar river the collection of 24 h composite samples from the rhine at koblenz rhine km 590 3 over the course of 23 consecutive days in march 2017 revealed a similar concentration curve compared to cbz which further supports the assumption that the main proportion of sulfamate in the rhine at this location originates from municipal wastewater rather than from industrial wastewater or diffuse sources data on the discharge of the rhine were available and allowed calculating the daily load of sulfamate during this sampling period of about 3 weeks the average load at koblenz was 10 6 1 9 t d which highlights the high emissions of sulfamate compared to other pollutants such as pharmaceuticals for example the average daily load of cbz during the same period was about 2500 times lower 0 0042 0 00091 t d sulfamate concentrations for the elbe river ranged from 8 9 μg l to 144 μg l a weaker correlation between the concentrations of sulfamate and cbz was found for the elbe river r 0 79 p 0 001 this could indicate a generally stronger influence of industrial discharges of sulfamate in the elbe river compared to the rhine river for the sampling conducted in the state of lower saxony sulfamate concentration ranged from 0 5 μg l to 580 μg l with a median of 31 μg l data not shown the correlation between sulfamate and cbz was weaker r 0 77 p 0 001 however the regression was heavily influenced by the leverage of the data points from two sampling sites which had exceptionally high concentrations of sulfamate 420 μg l and 480 μg l but common concentrations of cbz 140 ng l and 170 ng l without those two outliers the r was 0 91 all three of the sampled lakes showed sulfamate and cbz concentrations below or just above their respective loqs in germany streams in or downstream of urban areas as well as streams with low discharge typically contain between 5 and 20 of effluent under average flow conditions drewes et al 2018 since municipal wwtp effluent concentrations of sulfamate in germany are typically in the high μg l range see 3 1 it is reasonable to assume that for most wastewater impacted surface waters in germany the introduction of sulfamate by diffuse sources atmospheric deposition is greatly exceeded by wwtp effluents these findings are in contrast to the results obtained by van stempvoort et al 2019 in their study the authors assumed that sulfamate detected in environmental water samples from ontario canada was mostly originating from non wastewater sources it has to be noted that the cited study also included precipitation samples and a great number of samples from ground and surface waters with no or minor influence of wastewater more than 75 of the sampled surface waters in canada had a sulfamate concentration 2 μg l which could also indicate a generally lower wastewater influence on waterbodies in canada compared to germany 3 3 removal during drinking water production and occurrence in potable water in 5 of the 7 sampled drinking water samples sulfamate was detected in a concentration range of 1 7 μg l to 140 μg l the comparison of the sulfamate concentration of raw and finished drinking water at seven drinking water treatment plants dwtps suggests that sulfamate is not removed by oxidative treatment techniques further the results show that gac filtration is also inappropriate for sulfamate removal table 1 the correlation r 0 71 p 0 002 between sulfamate and cbz of samples from a dwtp using bank filtration located adjacent to the rhine river dwtp 8 was weaker compared to the surface waters analyzed in this study this could indicate biological degradation of sulfamate in the aquifer since cbz is not susceptible to biodegradation under the prevailing aerobic conditions average dissolved oxygen concentration in groundwater samples 5 5 1 1 mg l a substantial decrease 61 in the dilution corrected sulfamate concentration based on the cbz was observed between the raw water rhine 41 μg l and the water from the extraction well 16 μg l fig 4 the spatial sampling revealed a heterogeneous picture of sulfamate concentrations in the aquifer the lowest dilution corrected sulfamate concentration in well a 9 8 μg l was found at the highest well depths with the exception of well d the lowest dilution corrected concentration at the other observation points was always found at the middle depth of the well according to the operator of the water utility these findings are plausible and can be explained by different microstates specifically the heterogeneous distribution of flow velocities and directions in the aquifer therefore the retention times at the different wells well depths can vary considerably the elevated sulfamate concentrations in the landward groundwater can be explained by the fact that landward groundwater at the site is heavily influenced by the rhine under high flow conditions an even more pronounced removal of sulfamate was observed at two additional dtwps which are also situated adjacent to the rhine and use bank filtration as an additional treatment step again dilution corrected sulfamate concentrations were calculated based on the cbz concentrations of the respective samples on average dilution corrected sulfamate concentrations decreased by 82 and 99 during aquifer passage at dwtp 9 and dwtp 10 respectively table 2 due to the spatial proximity and the similar hydrogeological settings at the two sites differences in the removal of sulfamate are possibly explained by differences in the average residence time average residence time at dwtp 10 is about ten days longer than at dwtp 9 similar high removal was observed at a different bank filtration site which is operated with water from a wastewater impacted lake dwtp 11 during the sampling campaign conducted in june 2006 78 μg l of sulfamate were measured in the lake while concentrations were 1 μg l in the samples from two observation wells retention time 1 3 months sulfamate concentrations in the two observation wells were again 1 μg l in august 2018 the site is characterized by a transition from anoxic nitrate reducing to anaerobic iron and manganese reducing conditions in the summer months the results from these full scale bank filtration sites indicate that sulfamate is degraded during aquifer passage under aerobic and anaerobic conditions the fact that only bank filtration proved to be effective for the attenuation of sulfamate highlights the very importance of bank filtration within the multi barrier approach in water treatment 3 4 chemical degradability of sulfamate typical ozone doses in germany used for ozonation and disinfection purposes during drinking water production are between 0 5 mg l and 1 5 mg l sulfamate proved to be persistent during ozonation under these conditions removal 10 after 30 min at an initial ozone dose of 5 mg l according to the list of treatment agents and disinfection procedures pursuant to section 11 of the drinking water ordinance 2001 the maximum initial concentration of free chlorine for disinfection purposes in germany is 1 2 mg l dvgw 2018 over the course of one day no degradation of sulfamate was observed in drinking water when treated with an initial chlorine dose of 1 mg l fig s3 therefore sulfamate can be considered to be stable in drinking water when treated with realistic contact times and doses of the tested oxidizing agents this is further supported by the results obtained from the monitoring at full scale dwtps see 3 3 3 5 biological degradability of sulfamate in water sediment studies and natural attenuation both under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions a clear decrease of the initial sulfamate concentration c0 410 μg l was observed in contrast no considerable change of concentrations was observed in the autoclaved samples this strongly indicates a biologically mediated degradation of sulfamate under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions the almost linear decrease of concentrations indicated a degradation according to zero order kinetics degradation under anaerobic conditions was slightly but statistically significantly p 0 001 faster calculated t1 2 8 5 0 1 d than under aerobic conditions calculated t1 2 12 2 0 5 d fig 5 these results indicated that in general sulfamate is susceptible to biological degradation under a broad range of redox conditions this is in accordance with the substantial decrease in the dilution corrected sulfamate concentrations observed at several bank filtration sites see 3 3 in contrast the investigation of the natural attenuation of sulfamate in the small river usa located north of frankfurt main in hesse revealed no substantial removal along two river sections of about 7 5 km each fig s4 shows the normalized relative concentrations of sulfamate along both river sections for this the sulfamate concentration at each sampling point was normalized by the respective concentration of cbz to compensate for possible dilution and was then divided by the normalized sulfamate concentration at sampling point a no removal of sulfamate was observed on the first river stretch between a and b on the second stretch between c and d a minor even though statistically significant p 0 05 reduction by about 15 was found however considering the limited residence time of about 1 d for each river stretch a minor attenuation by biological degradation processes is in accordance with the results from batch experiments revealing a half live in the range of several days a minor attenuation of sulfamate in rivers and streams due the limited residence time and the constant discharge at multiple points by wwtps is also supported by the strong correlation of sulfamate and cbz concentrations discussed above 3 2 3 6 formation of sulfamate by biological degradation of potential precursors cyc and sac showed a similar degradation pattern in the zahn wellens test during the first 44 h of the test degradation of the precursors was slow within the following 72 h a much faster degradation of both precursors was observed and concentrations were just above the loq cyc and below the loq sac after 116 h although both artificial sweeteners were completely degraded in the test sulfamate formation was only minor with a molar yield after 14 d of 0 1 and 0 6 for sac and cyc respectively fig 6 even at the end of the test after 28 d of exposure of the precursors to the activated sludge sulfamate concentrations were still very low with a molar sulfamate yield of 0 2 and 0 7 for sac and cyc respectively these results suggest that the presence of sac and cyc in wwtp influents and their subsequent biological degradation do not substantially contribute to the sulfamate load discharged by a wwtp even if the typical concentrations of these precursors in wwtp influents can be in the μg l range 3 7 formation of sulfamate by chemical degradation of potential precursors fig 7 depicts the concentration profiles of potential sulfamate precursors and sulfamate in the ozonation experiments at an ozone dose of 0 5 mg l and an exposure time of 60 min the concentration of ace was reduced to about 20 of its initial value at an ozone dose of 5 mg l ace was decreased by 98 within the first 5 min of exposure in contrast cyc and sac showed slower degradation kinetics with ozone at an ozone dose of 0 5 mg l and an exposure time of 60 min cyc and sac concentrations only decreased to about 80 of their initial values at the higher ozone dose of 5 mg l and an exposure time of 60 min cyc and sac concentrations decreased to 2 and 30 of their initial value respectively fig 7 the overall higher removal rate of ace compared to cyc is in accordance to the findings of an earlier study and can be explained by the presence of a cc double bond in ace which is known to be easily cleaved by ozone according to the criegee mechanism scheurer et al 2012 rapid removal was also found for top whose concentration decreased to 1 of its initial value at an ozone dose of 0 5 mg l and an exposure time of 60 min the fastest reduction of the initial concentration was observed for hct which was completely removed under both ozone doses within the first 5 min of exposure fig 7 a very high reactivity of hct to ozone was also observed in a study conducted by borowska et al 2016 the formation of sulfamate from the degradation of the respective precursors differed considerably after 60 min and an ozone dose of 5 mg l most sulfamate formed on a molar base was from ace 56 in fact ace was nearly completely transformed after 5 min of contact to the ozone the steady increase of sulfamate over the course of the test indicated that intermediates were formed which were further oxidized to sulfamate for cyc a molar yield 35 was reached at an ozone dose of 5 mg l at the end of the experiment sac was the artificial sweetener which not only showed the highest stability to ozone but also had the lowest molar yield of sulfamate 14 at 5 mg l o3 although hct was already completely degraded after 5 min of contact time in the batch with 0 5 mg l and 5 mg l ozone sulfamate formation was only minor with molar yields of 5 and 16 respectively using non target screening borowska et al 2016 identified eight ozonation products of hct with chlorothiazide being the main ozone transformation product however sulfamate was not identified in the aforementioned study this can be explained by their usage of a c18 reversed phase lc column these columns generally do not provide sufficient retention of inorganic and very polar analytes such as sulfamate based on the results obtained for hct it is likely that other compounds containing a sulfonamide moiety are sulfamate precursors as well this is especially relevant as some sulfonamide drugs including the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole and the beta blocker sotalol are commonly present in raw waters used for drinking water production chauveheid and scholdis 2019 willach et al 2017 the lowest molar sulfamate yield of all tested compounds was found for top 3 despite its very fast removal at an ozone dose of 5 mg l fig 7 scheurer et al 2010 studied the performance of multi barrier dwtps for the removal of four artificial sweeteners sac and cyc were present in samples from the rhine which is used as a raw water source for drinking water production at concentrations between 0 03 and 0 18 μg l in contrast ace was found at concentrations 2 μg l in raw waters in the same study no reported concentrations of hct and top in raw water resources in germany could be found however an average concentration of 0 67 μg l of hct was reported for a raw water resource in spain used for drinking water production huerta fontela et al 2011 thus due to the generally high background concentration of sulfamate in tested raw waters see 3 3 it is not clear whether typical loads of potentially present precursors can substantially contribute to the sulfamate balance of a dwtp nevertheless the batch experiments confirm that sulfamate can be formed with highly compound specific yields through ozonation of precursors during drinking water production this is of particular relevance due to the highly mobile and persistent nature of sulfamate and the potentially high number of parent compounds of sulfamate additional studies are needed to get a better understanding which chemical moieties structures determine the potential of a substance to form sulfamate through degradation ozonation also finds increasing application in wastewater treatment as an advanced treatment step for the removal of micropollutants or disinfection purposes however no significant differences in the sulfamate concentration of the ozonated wwtp influent and effluent samples were observed fig s5 in summary the transformation of precursors to sulfamate in wwtps and in wastewater impacted water bodies can be considered to be quantitatively irrelevant due to the already very high concentrations of sulfamate in these compartments in germany subsequent studies are needed elucidate the relevance of different sources of sulfamate in other regions 3 8 eco toxicological relevance about 30 of all studied ground and surface water samples showed an rq 1 thus adverse effects of sulfamate on the aquatic ecosystem of wastewater impacted waterbodies in germany cannot be excluded the highest environmental concentration of sulfamate observed in this study was 580 μg l which is more than eight times the derived pnec 70 μg l text s4 it has to be noted that using an af of 1000 on short term toxicity data is a conservative approach and additional ecotoxicology testing should be conducted to allow for a better assessment of potential risk linked to the exposure of the aquatic ecosystem to sulfamate since sulfamate concentrations in wwtp effluents were as high as 1 6 mg l see 3 1 the concentrations of receiving waters with high proportions of effluent or even effluent dependent streams paretti et al 2019 should be further investigated in subsequent studies to assess the risk to human health a gv for sulfamate was derived based on the noael of 1000 mg kg bw d reported in a feeding study on rats with 90 d exposure period the noael value from this specific study was selected as it was considered to be the best subchronic toxicity study available to calculate the derived no effect level dnel for long term exposure by the european chemicals agency echa 2019 by multiplying the afs for intraspecific variability af 10 interspecific variability af 10 and for extrapolation from subchronic to chronic exposure af 10 an overall af of 1000 was obtained based on a noael of 1000 mg kg bw d and an overall af of 1000 a tdi of 1000 μg kg bw was calculated assuming an average body weight of 60 kg a daily drinking water consumption of 2 l and an allocation of 20 a gv for sulfamate of 6 mg l was derived the highest drinking water concentration of sulfamate observed in this study was 140 μg l which is about 42 times lower than the gv indicating that current sulfamate concentrations in drinking water in germany do not represent any significant risk to human health over a lifetime of consumption further it has to be noted that sa is listed by the united states food and drug administration fda as a substance added indirectly to human food affirmed as generally recognized as safe gras ghazala 2003 however from the standpoint of drinking water hygiene and following the precautionary principle sulfamate concentrations in drinking water should be kept as low as reasonably practicable 4 conclusions sulfamate is ubiquitously present in wwtp effluents as well as in wastewater impacted water bodies in germany the predominant source of sulfamate in major surface waters in germany is wwtp effluent potential atmospheric deposition of sulfamate only plays a minor role in the general sulfamate budget of the urban water cycle ozonation and activated sludge experiments proved that sulfamate can be formed to different extents from chemical and biological degradation of various precursors however the transformation of precursors to sulfamate in wwtps and in wastewater impacted water bodies was found to be quantitatively irrelevant due to the already very high concentrations of sulfamate in these compartments in germany commonly applied treatment techniques in waterworks are not capable to remove sulfamate the results from biological degradation tests and from the analysis of samples taken at a bank filtration site indicate that sulfamate is removed to some extent in the sediment water interface of aquatic systems and during aquifer passage under aerobic and anaerobic conditions a conservative risk quotient based analysis indicates that effects of sulfamate to aquatic organisms in wastewater impacted waterbodies in germany cannot be excluded so far the calculation of a health based guide value for sulfamate portents that current sulfamate concentrations in drinking water in germany do not represent any

18029,high solid anaerobic digestion had can directly treat dewatered sewage sludge total solid content 15 with superior volume efficiency sludge stabilization during had is expected to achieve by throughout organic degradation and conversion towards methane rich biogas release and humic formation sewage sludge is the combination of microbial zoogleas and theirs adsorption of organic and inorganic matter in which the extracellular polymeric substances eps account 60 80 of total sludge organic matter inevitably participating most extracellular metabolic pathways the interactions between eps transformation and genetically annotated metabolic pathways were found in this research in brief noticing the highly cross linked structures in eps with major active components of humic substances hs and protein pn as pn hydrolysis and decomposition in eps were enhanced in the high solid anaerobic condition the exposure of aromatic groups and sites in hs were considerable hs release was the main factor shifting the electron exchange capacity and activity which aided in energy metabolism of sludge microorganisms involved in redox reactions especially the methanogenesis thus in turn facilitating the pn degradation then the screened humic groups and active protein derives might act as the beneficial precursors to regenerate neo humic structures whose significant bridging effect and signal role on stimulating amino acid biosynthesis member transport and metallic complexation could further contribute to proteolytic condensation and eps reconstruction hence the in depth sludge stabilization mechanism during had process was established for developing enlightening strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords high solid anaerobic digestion sludge stabilization extracellular polymeric substances humification metagenomics 1 introduction the stabilization and treatment of large amounts of sewage sludge produced from wastewater treatment pose a challenge worldwide highly attributing to the potential risk of secondary pollution including a high content of pathogenic bacteria unstable organic matter micropollutants heavy metals and other harmful substances zeng et al 2019 anaerobic digestion ad is a biochemical popular process used for sludge stabilization with the limitation of development of pathogenic fauna the efficient organic reduction and energy recovery in the form of methane rich biogas 60 70 vol of methane ch4 cieślik et al 2015 in china in order to minimize the volume of waste sludge most municipal sludge before discharge has been dewatered to become high solid sludge with total solid content greater than 10 w w meanwhile compared with low solid anaerobic digestion high solid anaerobic digestion had typically with ts 15 w w using dewatered sludge as substrates is a more economical option due to smaller reactors higher volumetric methane productivity and lower energy demand for heating duan et al 2012 sludge stabilization in had having high organic loading rate is expected to achieve via both biogas recovery based on volatile solid degradation and biomass stabilization arnaiz et al 2006 our previous researches have reported had is superior with much higher volumetric methane production rate and obvious regeneration of aromatic structures of humic acids with significant phytotoxicity reduction duan et al 2012 tang et al 2018 however considering the complicated space configuration of extracellular organic substances mass transfer limitation and complicated microbial response it is still difficult to satisfy the requirement of the oriented throughout conversion for biogas release and humification tang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 thus understanding the biochemical and genomic driving forces of sludge stabilization in had has theoretical and practical significance however the comprehensive mechanism towards enhanced sludge stabilization via had is still lacking of discussion extracellular polymeric substances eps are produced from cell lysis and adsorbed organic matters from wastewater comprising the polysaccharide protein nucleic acids uronic acids humic substances lipids and etc henze et al 2008 sheng et al 2010 eps contain 60 80 of sludge organic matter and play a crucial role on exemplary physiological rheological and physio chemical properties eps further act as the origin of the majority of dissolved organic matter dom i e the easily useable carbon source for biogas producing microorganism thus ad is considered on the basis of eps degradation and conversion conducted by anaerobic bacteria contained in flocs dai et al 2013b xue et al 2015 on the other hand eps are released for resistance to harmful exogenous materials by serving as adsorbing agents to accumulate nutrients and heavy metals from the surrounding environment xiao and zheng 2016 therefore the extracellular organic matter can be hypothesized like the comet tail with the microbial cells as the nucleus because eps make up the major sludge organic culture but actually eps transformation is determined by intracellular metabolism gupta and diwan 2017 pal and a k 2007 wang et al 2018 xiao and zheng 2016 zhu et al 2012 hence a better understanding of the interaction between eps variation and microbial metabolic evolution is necessary for stabilization treatment and resource recovery development however little information about that has displayed during high solid ad process multiple measurements should be used for comprehensive characterization on eps due to the complex structures consisting of various cross linked components and functional groups liu and fang 2002 phoenix et al 2002 recently the corrected lowry method has been widely used as quantitative determination of protein and humic compounds frolund et al 1995 and the novel in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos method was useful to investigate the specific designation and structure change sequence of functional groups in eps ye et al 2018a the fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eem is a quick sensitive and nondestructive characterization on major organic compounds wang et al 2015 gel permeation chromatography gpc is able to assess molecular weight distribution and thereby characterizing the biodegradation and polymerization of eps and the chronoamperometry measurement can quantify the electron accepting capacity and electron donating capacity of eps according to yu et al 2015 moreover the development of metagenomics allows the functional microorganisms and genes to be identified in specific activities wang et al 2016a on basis of these analytical methods considerable information regarding the functional metabolic pathways and corresponding structural and redox changes in eps during high solid anaerobic digestion can be obtained the purpose of this study is to investigate the comprehensive capabilities of organic reconstruction during had and its potential for sludge stabilization according to the correlation analysis between characteristic changes in eps and genomic based functional pathways our results are expected to provide guidance on the in depth organic transformation to all of the challenges associated with process performance and the stabilized degree of sludge

metagenomic analysis were placed at 80 c 2 2 eps extraction and chemical analysis a mixture of 8 g digestate sludge and 80 ml deionized water was centrifuged 6000 g 15 min to separate the solids from solution and the supernatant liquor was collected as the dissolved organic matter dom after using 80 ml deionized water to resuspended the remaining solids the formaldehyde plus naoh method was used to avoid damaging the biopolymer metal complex liu and fang 2002 xu et al 2018 for the following electrochemical tests on the other hand the number of binding sites and complexion capacities of eps are correlated with proteins polysaccharides and humic substances content because of the presence of functional groups such as carboxylates hydroxyls and amines guibaud 2003 lesmana 2009 therefore the masking effect of the structure of mineral eps associations on the characterization of various organic materials and functional groups was nonnegligible and it is difficult to detect the eps transformation by spectroscopic and chromatographic measurements hence we did the acid treatment of eps for deprotonation i e ion exchange before 3deem ftir and gpc analysis in detail taking half of the supernatant obtained by the last step of formaldehyde plus naoh method the solution was adjusted to ph 4 with 3 mol l 1 hcl standing in 4 c for more than 10 h for complete deprotonation after

quantified in terms of humic acids proteins and polysaccharides the concentration of protein and humic acids were analyzed using a enzyme labeled instrument elx800 biotek us following the modified lowry method frolund b et al 1995 whereas the polysaccharide content was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 freeze dried eps samples were dissolved as 1 mg with 10 ml

had as shown in table 2 the vs ts decreased sharply in the start up period from 48 54 had 1d to 44 57 had 8d resulting from intensive organic decomposition by anaerobic microbes and then vs ts reduced slightly during the last 24 days the total degradation rate of sludge organic matter reached 56 61 according to koch et al 2009 in consistent with previous studies dong et al 2013 duan et al 2012 shao et al 2013 the average biogas yield produced from the digesters was 716 ml g 1 vsremoval or 420 ml g 1 vsadded which is consistent with previous results of biogas production dong et al 2013 xue et al 2015 and therein carbon emissions of ch4 and co2 accounted for 94 5 of the total organic carbon degradation see detail calculation below table s1 in supplement information highly meeting the carbon balance guo and dai 2017 the daily biogas production based on vs degradation i e dbp shifted rapidly to the 162 0 ml g 1 vsremoval in had 2d and then continuously turned down to the end the vfa of substrate had drastic shift in first 2 days and rapid reduction from 6 106 to 0 808 mg g 1 in day 2 12 in conjunction with final value of 0 307 mg g 1 indicating the efficient transformation of the acidogenic product so as to having low impact on anaerobic system moreover the high concentration of free nh3 typically from the enhanced anaerobic mineralization of proteinaceous substance with solid content increase is able to contribute more alkalinity and ph growth duan et al 2012 therefore great buffering capacity made slight ph changes and a small rebound during the final 16 days explicable the quick increase of ec from 1 724 ms cm 1 had 1d to the highest level of 2 519 ms cm 1 had 8d imply the intense salinity accumulation li et al 2016 while later the ec drop ended up with 1 310 ms cm 1 had 28d was primarily attributed to the loss of soluble salts by microbial immobilization and or the formation of insoluble salts e g by chelating humic substances bustamante et al 2012 the germination index gi as the important indicator of digestate phytotoxicity significantly recovered from 29 had 12d to final 73 had 28d suggesting the remarkable stabilization progress himanen et al 2012 li et al 2016 tang et al 2018 3 2 chemical compositions of eps from high solid digestate as the had proceeded the total eps of vs decreased from 645 2 4 3 had 1d to 493 6 1 3 had 8d and then increased again to 645 2 3 2 mg had 28d table 3 the lessened eps concentration in the initial 8 days could be explained by the biodegradation of protein pn and polysaccharide ps as a promising carbon and energy source for cell growth in comparation the eps variation in traditional anaerobic treatment was previously reported to end up with a final downward due to nutrient shortage but the eps decrease belong to had appeared and finished much earlier ye et al 2018b high eps concentration is expected to govern to a certain extent the stability of microbial aggregates hence the distinct rebound of eps during had 12 28d would result in greater sludge stability mikkelsen and nielsen 2001 moreover as the organic load rate increasing duan et al 2012 total eps content in this study was the 4 6 times higher than those of low solid methanogenic sludges liu and fang 2002 which was consistent with the results in previous reports an et al 2017 wang et al 2016b furthermore the efficient eps recovery after the drastic consumption in the first 8 days seemed to firmly bound with the changes of proteinaceous materials the initial predominance of pn in the eps is likely due to the presence of a large quantity of exoenzymes frolund b et al 1995 and precisely because the protein binding structures in eps destroyed and hydrolyzed the original hs were allowed to expose from 19 78 had 1d to 22 91 had 8d moreover during had 12 28d the pn proportion evidently enhanced from 37 78 to 48 39 with small drop of ps by 2 04 while the humic substances hs declined from 21 2 to 17 13 comparatively the final percent of pn was higher than that found in the extracted eps of low solid methanogenic sludges 41 whereas hs was obviously lower than the level of 22 8 as previously reported liu and fang 2002 highlighting the greater concentration of pn in eps during had 3 3 interactions between eps transformation and genetically annotated metabolic evolution during had process 3 3 1 evidences of eps reconstruction during had process 3 3 1 1 three dimensional 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy two major components of eps in high solid digestate were detected in eem plots fig 1 peak a and b were identified at excitation emission ex em wavelengths around 289 294 378 383 nm and 325 468 nm respectively which are described as aromatic amino acid e g tryptophan associated to protein like substances pn and humic like substances hs chen et al 2003 the intensity of fluorescent peak a reached to its highest value in had 2d and then drastically turned down to the lowest in had 8d suggesting the intense protein hydrolysis and biodegradation the intensity of hs peak exhibited the small bulge in had 2d and then created a slight growth while pn was decreasing during had 4 8d implying the relative release of hs at the beginning of had then the intensity of pn continuously enhanced to had 28d whereas that of hs declined to the end after reaching its highest in had 12d it is worth noting that the overall decrease of hs seemed to be in contradiction with the commonly assumed refractory characteristics of hs in fact few authors have ever reported an increase in the total amount of hs during the anaerobic treatment of sewage sludge in the view of soil microbiology hs are able to be biodegraded by anaerobic microbes before neo humic production dou and wang 2011 indeed our previous work regards of structural transformation of the humic acid like molecules ha in had process determined the consumption of ha especially in the start up stage suggesting ha in rs are still unstable that could be decomposed as carbon resource though later the aromatic regeneration in ha has also been observed tang et al 2018 in this experiment in the case of initial rapid decrease of volatile solids and total eps content the growth of hs proportion in eps from 19 78 had 1d to 22 91 had 8d as well as the corresponding fluorescent intensity confirm its relative difficulty of degradation by microorganism on the other hand considering the cross linked hs and pn in eps the drastic decomposition of original protein like fraction coagulated in hs may contribute to the total reduction of hs and further aromatic hs core exposure making the initial release of aromatic groups in hs and the decline in total amount explicable however during the last 20 day had the vs ts reduction slowed down with the rebounds of eps concentration and pn percentage hs turned to decrease ending with the lowest level 17 13 in eps in consequence the total consumption of volatile solids and the redistribution in sludge eps determine hs changes in had further molecular investigations are shown in next paragraphs 3 3 1 2 mw distribution the weight average molecular weight mw distribution of eps provides information about the configuration profile fig 2 at the early stage the intensive eps deflocculation and degradation were primarily shown by the accumulated fraction of mw 45 kda by 7 209 during had 1 8d and the obvious downward of those 100 300 kda in had 8d the smaller and smaller molecular substances could be used as carbon and energy source for cell growth duan et al 2014 more et al 2014 nevertheless during the last 20 days as the eps decomposition and vs ts removal slowed down tables 2 and 3 the eps fraction of mw 45 kda evidently rebounded by 15 250 and the super macromolecules characterized with 100 kda regenerated from 50 556 to 65 926 as previously reported the extended eps molecules involve more adsorption points and stronger bridging resulted in polymerization and structural stability of sludge particulate xu et al 2017 2018 moreover the proportion of 20 45 kda almost changed simultaneously with hs while the variation of molecules 100 kda especially 300 kda greatly attributed to pn which were consistent with previous studies duan et al 2014 li et al 2012 compared to the low solid culture zhang et al 2016 the high solid condition seemingly to be beneficial to a rapid eps reconstruction composed of high molecules 3 3 1 3 elemental analysis change in elemental composition and atomic ratios of eps are shown in table 3 and fig 3 a carbon c and hydrogen h had severe consumptions from 33 371 to 5 493 had 1d to 28 465 and 4 543 had 8d and then both c and h rose back to 33 887 and 5 273 had 28d respectively having the lower level than that of rs 2 282 the h c molar ratio had twice drop from 1 975 had 1d to the lowest value of 1 867 had 28d the decrease of h content and h c ratio indicate the dehydration or unsaturation from a carboxyl or carbonyl group wang et al 2019 combining the lysis and destruction of most protein binding structures the relative hs release during had 1 8d confirmed the enhanced aromaticity in eps lü et al 2017 further though hs content actually tended to be less and less during had 8 28d the repolymerization of aromatic structures in hs may induce the second larger drop of h c tang et al 2018 on the other hand after the obvious nitrogen content n loss 3 585 the n growth of 1 981 and the c n drop from 6 699 to 5 698 in final 20 days represented the relative increased nitrogen containing compounds e g proteins to carbon containing compounds e g carbohydrates and lipids wang et al 2019 moreover the declined h c and c n could also pointed out the polycondensation of proteinaceous substrates and aromatic amino acids in neo humic structures amir et al 2006 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 see fig 4 3 3 1 4 electrochemical analysis eps have been reported to act as endogenous redox mediators to participate metabolisms in which mainly donated by functional groups of carboxyl phenol hydroxyl amine and quinine groups in eps ye et al 2018a 2018b the electron exchange capacity and redox activity were measured fig 3b the electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc exhibited the initial loss to 9 56 and 9 67 μmol e g 1 c in had 2d and then both generally increased to the highest levels of 10 75 and 10 54 μmol e g 1 c in had 8d and had 12d respectively later the continuous declinations of eac and edc ended up with 9 93 and 9 80 μmol e g 1 c had 28d considering eps transformation discussed above the sudden eec loss in had 2d may be primally caused by the intense eps decomposition evidenced by reduced eps content weak fraction of mw 20 45 kda and sharp consumption of nitrogen and carbon resource then the values of eac and edc were almost equal and both significantly enhanced during had 2 12d at the same period the content and fluorescent intensity of hs also had the strong increase trends more redox active mediators such as hs particularly in tight bound eps could accelerate the interspecies electron transfer process between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea which highlighted the hs release and exposure as extracellular electron shuttles promoting methane production jie and andreas 2008 li et al 2013 finally the eec turned down to the lowest value highly explained by hs decrease and eps repolymerization regarding to op and rp the absolute values of oxidation and reduction peaks the smaller values the more likely the redox actions in eps are able to occur as shown in fig 3b the op and rp declined from 0 436v to 1 019v had 1d to 0 358v and 0 997v had 8d while later their reinforcements reached to 0 512v and 1 073v as the highest points had 28d in addition the end op and rp were even higher than that of rs 0 458v and 1 061v results imply eps could be oxidized and reduced most easily in the middle stage of had but finally the oxidation and reaction became more difficult to happen than that in rs describing the structural stabilization of high solid digestate 3 3 1 5 ftir 2d correlation spectroscopy the chemical structure of humic substances is very complex with multiple carboxyl and phenolic functional groups stevenson 1994 further the humic substances system in eps is formed through the association of several components during the humification process such as amino acids lignin pectin or carbohydrates through inter molecular forces donor acceptor ionic hydrophilic and hydrophobic more et al 2014 the sign of the cross peak in the synchronous map was positive indicating that conformational change was in the same direction chen et al 2015 asynchronous map could not only facilitate the deconvolution of overlapping peaks but also present the useful information about the sequential relationship between different redox groups ye et al 2018a the signs of the cross peaks in the synchronous map associated with 1648 1104 1536 and 976 cm 1 were positive demonstrating the corresponding groups of amide i and or aromatic ring structure polysaccharides amide ii and aromatic hydrocarbon showed conformational change in the same direction as the result the early release aromatic groups attributed to hs seemed to be active with polysaccharides together with metabolites from proteins according to asynchronous map the eps transformation degree or susceptibility over time as the followed sequence 1180 1000 1081 1397 1513 1585 1704 988 1531 1650 cm 1 illustrating the eps transformation changed as the routine c oh and c o associated with amino acids and or polysaccharides c o c ring vibrations and c oh stretches derived from polysaccharides coo stretches associated with amino acids and carboxylic acid co nh of amide ii unsaturated and aromatic cc aromatic aldehydes and carboxyl groups aromatic hydrocarbon co nh of amide ii amide i materials and aromatic ring structures noda and ozaki 2005 therefore after the polysaccharides were highly consumed with proteins those unsaturated and aromatic structure have been further proved to reconstruct forming new hs with abundant carboxylic groups combined chemical and spectroscopic evidence discussed above the process of destruction decomposition and repolymerization in eps during high solid anaerobic biotransformation might be descripted first of all as hs and pn accumulation in eps from sludge endogenous consumption after sedimentation and or dewatering henze et al 2008 the highly cross linked structures and the spatial interaction between components in eps of high solid sludge can be further verified more et al 2014 sheng et al 2010 xu et al 2017 2018 when the mineralization of proteinaceous substrate shifted with solid content increase during anaerobic treatment an et al 2017 hao et al 2016 wang et al 2016b yu 2018 the hs release from eps at the beginning of had was considerable considering hs exposure acted as the electron shuttle body without selectivity thus once the proteolytic launch towards eps deconstruction successful subsequent humic release is able to follow up by aiding electron transfer and energy metabolism then the initial hs release and aromatic amino acids from pn degradation prepare for neo humic formation and hs repolymerization amir et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 therefore the original hs in eps collected from endogenous residual could be degraded and modified moreover the enlarged hs with abundant aromatic sites may also bridge pn condensation xu et al 2017 2018 finally achieving eps reconstruction 3 3 2 functional role of humification on methanogenesis and eps reconstruction 3 3 2 1 rda analysis redundancy analysis rda was used to investigate the correlations among eps composition process performance of eps characteristics and the major metabolic evolution demonstrated by rpkm abundance changes of top 10 kegg modules fig 5 the functional annotation and changes of top 10 can be referenced in fig 6 the first two modules were m00178 ribosome and m00359 aminoacyl trna biosynthesis both responsible to translation following as m00009 citrate cycle and m00001 glycolysis about the carbohydrate metabolism the next group was classified as the membrane transport including abc 2type m00254 branched chain amino acid m00237 peptides nickel m00239 and putative multiple sugar m00207 and the last two modules were m00144 nadh quinone oxidoreductase prokaryotes and m00048 inosine monophosphate biosynthesis roughly except the obvious upregulation of member transport during had 8 28d most other top 10 modules reduced after initial slight increase or decrease rda 1 and rda 2 explained 93 24 total variation of the module abundance and diversity hs content in eps p 0 013 had the most significant correlation on the distribution of gene based modules implying hs played the crucial role in metagenomic regulation during the stabilization process in had yang et al 2016 top 10 modules were clearly divided into two clusters that were close to daily biogas production i e dbp and gi respectively because the angles between arrows indicate correlations between two variables besides hs together with pn exhibited in both fig 5a and b in highly reverse direction the other 8 vectors were divided into two groups according to their relationship to dbp and gi yang et al 2016 with positive relationship with dbp h c and c n in eps distributed in the same quadrant with the modules about translation and energy metabolisms involving m00001 glycolysis m00009 citrate cycle m00178 ribosome m00359 amino trna biosynthesis m00144 nadh quinone oxidoreductase and m00048 inosine monophosphate fig 5a as previously reported the ultimate methane yield has evident negative relations with the reduction of h content and h c in pretreated eps which suggest it is much possible that dehydration of hydrogen bonding networks improve the methane production lü et al 2017 besides the abundant nitrogen content n and the n c ratio in lightly bound eps were important for the initial methane production rate lü et al 2017 suggesting the initial biogas production may prefer n containing resource considering h c decline and c n strength related positively to hs but negatively to pn in this study the anaerobic biotreatment for methane release may precisely attributed to the dehydration and consumption of protein binding hydrogen bonding networks simultaneously the humic structures release from eps brought about the relative higher aromaticity and lower h c moreover hs is the major factor shifting electron exchange capacity i e eec in eps to reduce the energy requirement for electrons transition of a series of microbial energy metabolism involved in redox reactions wang et al 2018 thus the dramatic consumption of pn typically embodied as rapid decline of h and n contents and efficient biogas release could be facilitated by initial active hs release lovley 2017 lovley et al 1996 having the intensive sludge degradation our previous research found excessive organic and or inorganic salts accumulated under this high load condition mostly caused the sludge ecotoxicity but later aromatic repolymerization of hs could reduce phytotoxicity to some extent tang et al 2018 interesting in this study the most direct executor of salinity immobilization seemed to be the proteolytic condensation in detail towards the final direction of gi improvement the content of pn increased while hs decreased together with redox activity inhibition fig 5b meanwhile the pn condensation and eps reconstruction could be observed according to functional transport systems of putative multiple sugar peptides nickel branched chain amino acid and abc 2 type m00207 m00239 m00237 m00254 significantly recovered during had 12 28d fig 5b the modules mentioned exhibited much larger enhancement than other modules during final 16 day had fig 6a and more modules of transport systems of putative simple sugar m00221 oligopeptide m00439 and iron complex m00240 with similar changes accumulated together with pn op rp and gi fig 5b since the op and rp became higher the redox activities were more difficult to occur speculatively pn repolymerization might limit oxidative and reductive activities in eps though which seemingly to promote gi hence the significant c n loss together with pn rebound were consistent underlying that n containing compounds were substantially increased with the growth of polymerization degree in eps wang et al 2018 further as the most significant factor for module distribution the aromatic regeneration in hs may bridge pn repolymerization preventing from further sludge degradation and serve phytotoxicity 3 3 2 2 spearman correlations coefficient significance rank test spearman correlations coefficient tests were applied for further determining specific dependencies between eps transformation and major metabolic classification in which the top 30 modules fig 6a as well as the top 20 metabolic pathways predicted by level 3 kegg ortholog function fig 6b were discussed as the representative indicator of two aspects towards sludge stabilization dbp and gi obviously led two groups of eps characteristics having different correlation results no matter with modules and level 3 functions the positive effects of c n h c hs and eec on dbp were proven again in detail having the strongest correlation with dbp h c significantly related to translation pathways fig 6b and energy metabolism modules fig 6a of methanogenesis m00357 lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis m00060 glycolysis m00001 and phospholipid transport system m00210 the amino acid and peptide biosynthesis were responsible for the close relation between hs and c n fig 6a mainly including valine isoleucine biosynthesis m00019 nitt taut family transport system m00188 tryptophan biosynthesis m00023 leucine biosynthesis m00432 and heme biosynthesis m00121 those biosynthesis of amino acids might prepared for hs regeneration together with the screened origin aromatic structures as precursors tang et al 2018 though total hs content in eps also strikingly decreased in this study ye et al 2018b in addition similar correlation results on iron complex transport system m00240 and heme biosynthesis m00121 linked hs and eec while the signal transduction provided the linkage between h c and hs indicating hs in eps might play both chemical and biological roles on functional metabolism as for those factors related to gi improvement the pn recovery redox activity inhibition and ps reduction were mainly explained by enhanced member transport systems of peptides nickel branched chain amino acid abc 2 type putative multiple sugar putative simple sugar and oligopeptide m00239 m00237 m00254 m00207 m00221 and m00439 together with iron complex m00240 fig 6a as shown in fig 6b the notable negative correlations with translation and energy metabolism belong to pn and op rebound interestingly regarding to peptidoglycan biosynthesis gi had a great correlation and pn op and rp showed weaker positive relations while eec and hs related negatively with that highly confirming pn have a higher binding strength and capability than hs more et al 2014 taken into consideration that the signal transduction of two component system and quorum sensing strongly related to hs fig 6b it is likely the regeneration of aromatic structures in hs exerted as the specific signal driving various biopolymers to embody in hs in a special polymerized form in other words the humification is a process in which various substances are prepared for synthesizing macromolecules with similar properties to them dou et al 2016 functionally the reconstruction of hs in eps with more unsaturated structures wang et al 2018 bridged pn repolymerization and complexes with metal cations within the exopolymeric matrix gupta and diwan 2017 sajjad et al 2017 sheng et al 2013 hence with fade oxidation and polyphenolic condensation shao et al 2013 the relative passive humification stimulated pn repolymerization in eps for self defense which made the release of carbohydrate more difficult and reduced phytotoxicity achieving greatly comprehensive sludge stabilization during high solid ad provenzano et al 2016 ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 in general besides the bridging effect hs repolymerization actually also act as a signal for cellular defense during the period of anaerobic sludge stabilization which stimulate pn condensation by regulating amino acids biosynthesis member transport systems and etc 4 conclusion first of all as the major component in eps pn directly execute the sludge stabilization process in had since pn decomposition of eps serve for methane production and proteolytic condensation could prevent from further sludge degradation and phytotoxicity aggravation however the actual progress of sludge stabilization depends on the humification process understanding the essential roles of hs release on unstable organic degradation by facilitating energy metabolism especially those based on proteinaceous substrate and noticing the meditated effects of hs regeneration on eps reconstruction by providing aromatic core structures and stimulating self defense mechanism are of great implication for systematical sludge stabilization under high organic load and further biomass resource recovery thus new strategies such as stimulating hs growth in eps for improving redox activity by e g hematite of red mud addition ye et al 2018b or alternating active humic exposure and enhancing pn degradation by e g intermittent micro aeration on

18029,high solid anaerobic digestion had can directly treat dewatered sewage sludge total solid content 15 with superior volume efficiency sludge stabilization during had is expected to achieve by throughout organic degradation and conversion towards methane rich biogas release and humic formation sewage sludge is the combination of microbial zoogleas and theirs adsorption of organic and inorganic matter in which the extracellular polymeric substances eps account 60 80 of total sludge organic matter inevitably participating most extracellular metabolic pathways the interactions between eps transformation and genetically annotated metabolic pathways were found in this research in brief noticing the highly cross linked structures in eps with major active components of humic substances hs and protein pn as pn hydrolysis and decomposition in eps were enhanced in the high solid anaerobic condition the exposure of aromatic groups and sites in hs were considerable hs release was the main factor shifting the electron exchange capacity and activity which aided in energy metabolism of sludge microorganisms involved in redox reactions especially the methanogenesis thus in turn facilitating the pn degradation then the screened humic groups and active protein derives might act as the beneficial precursors to regenerate neo humic structures whose significant bridging effect and signal role on stimulating amino acid biosynthesis member transport and metallic complexation could further contribute to proteolytic condensation and eps reconstruction hence the in depth sludge stabilization mechanism during had process was established for developing enlightening strategies graphical abstract image 1 keywords high solid anaerobic digestion sludge stabilization

worldwide highly attributing to the potential risk of secondary pollution including a high content of pathogenic bacteria unstable organic matter micropollutants heavy metals and other harmful

and energy recovery in the form of methane rich biogas 60 70 vol of methane ch4 cieślik et al 2015 in china in order to minimize the volume of waste sludge most municipal sludge before discharge has been dewatered to become high solid sludge with total solid content greater than 10 w w meanwhile compared with low solid anaerobic digestion high solid anaerobic digestion had typically with ts 15 w w using dewatered sludge as substrates is a more economical option due to smaller reactors higher volumetric methane productivity and lower energy demand for heating duan et al 2012 sludge stabilization in had having high organic loading rate is expected to achieve via both biogas recovery based on volatile solid degradation and biomass stabilization arnaiz et al 2006 our previous researches have reported had is superior with much higher volumetric methane production rate and obvious regeneration of aromatic structures of humic acids with significant phytotoxicity reduction duan et al 2012 tang et al 2018 however considering the complicated space configuration of extracellular organic substances mass transfer limitation and complicated microbial response it is still difficult to satisfy the requirement of the oriented throughout conversion for biogas release and humification tang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 thus understanding the biochemical and genomic driving forces of sludge stabilization in had has theoretical and practical significance however the comprehensive mechanism towards enhanced sludge stabilization via had is still lacking of discussion extracellular polymeric substances eps are produced from cell lysis and adsorbed organic matters from wastewater comprising the polysaccharide protein nucleic acids uronic acids humic substances lipids and etc henze et al 2008 sheng et al 2010 eps contain 60 80 of sludge organic matter and play a crucial role on exemplary physiological rheological and physio chemical properties eps further act as the origin of the majority of dissolved organic matter dom i e the easily useable carbon source for biogas producing microorganism thus ad is considered on the basis of eps degradation and conversion conducted by anaerobic bacteria contained in flocs dai et al 2013b xue et al 2015 on the other hand eps are released for resistance to harmful exogenous materials by serving as adsorbing agents to accumulate nutrients and heavy metals from the surrounding environment xiao and zheng 2016 therefore the extracellular organic matter can be hypothesized like the comet tail with the microbial cells as the nucleus because eps make up the major sludge organic culture but actually eps transformation is determined by intracellular metabolism gupta and diwan 2017 pal and a k 2007 wang et al 2018 xiao and zheng 2016 zhu et al 2012 hence a better understanding of the interaction between eps variation and microbial metabolic evolution is necessary for stabilization treatment and resource recovery development however little information about that has displayed during high solid ad process multiple measurements should be used for comprehensive characterization on eps due to the complex structures consisting of various cross linked components and functional groups liu and fang 2002 phoenix et al 2002 recently the corrected lowry method has been widely used as quantitative determination of protein and humic compounds frolund et al 1995 and the novel in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos method was useful to investigate the specific designation and structure change sequence of functional groups in eps ye et al 2018a the fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eem is a quick sensitive and nondestructive characterization on major organic compounds wang et al 2015 gel permeation chromatography gpc is able to assess molecular weight distribution and thereby characterizing the biodegradation and polymerization of eps and the chronoamperometry measurement can quantify the electron accepting capacity and electron donating capacity of eps according to yu et al 2015 moreover the development of metagenomics allows the functional microorganisms and genes to be identified in specific activities wang et al 2016a on basis of these analytical methods considerable information regarding the functional metabolic pathways and corresponding structural and redox changes in eps during high solid anaerobic digestion can be obtained the purpose of this study is to investigate the comprehensive capabilities of organic reconstruction during had and its potential for sludge stabilization according to the correlation analysis between characteristic changes in eps and genomic based functional pathways our results are expected to provide guidance on the in depth organic transformation to all of the challenges associated with process performance and the stabilized degree of sludge end product 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates had trials and physicochemical tests dewatered raw sewage sludge rs collected at the dehydration machine room of anting wastewater treatment plant in shanghai was used as the substrate for had treatment and stored at 4 c less than 2d before used total solids ts content of the dewatered sludge was 23 43 w w and volatile solids vs accounted for 61 98 w w of ts the mesophilic inoculum sludge is collected from anaerobic digester with a volume of 6 l that has been operated for 3 months had ts of 15 42 w w and vs ts of 45 28 characteristics of rs and is are listed in table 1 at the beginning 1 617 kg rs and 0 462 kg is were mixed and added to the reactor which was operated in batch mode for 28 d at 35 1 c the mesophilic anaerobic digestion reactor with a working volume of 4 l was set up with helix type stirrers at a rate of 60 rpm rotations per minute with 10 min stirring and 10 min break continuously volumes of produced biogas were measured by wet gas meters every day for detecting and ensuring the representative high solid anaerobic system biogas and substrate samples in the reactors were taken every two days and analyzed for methane content ph ts vs volatile fatty acids vfa and total ammonia dai et al 2013a duan et al 2012 the ch4 and co2 content of the biogas was determined using a gas chromatograph gc112a inesa china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector to analyze vfas the sludge digestate samples were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min then the supernatant was filtrated by 0 45 μm and the filtrate was acidified by formic acid to adjust the ph to approximately 2 0 before vfa was analyzed by a gc agilent technologies 6890 ca usa with flame ionization detector ts vs and ammonia were determined according to standard methods eaton et al 1995 for further statistic correlation analysis the daily biogas production dbp was calculated as the cumulative biogas production yield per g vs removal and per day up to each operation time of sampling ml g 1 vsremoval henze et al 2008 khalid et al 2011 samples prepared for eps extraction were collected every two or four days and stored at 20 c while those for metagenomic analysis were placed at 80 c 2 2 eps extraction and chemical analysis a mixture of 8 g digestate sludge and 80 ml deionized water was centrifuged 6000 g 15 min to separate the solids from solution and the supernatant liquor was collected as the dissolved organic matter dom after using 80 ml deionized water to resuspended the remaining solids the formaldehyde plus naoh method was used to avoid damaging the biopolymer metal complex liu and fang 2002 xu et al 2018 for the following electrochemical tests on the other hand the number of binding sites and complexion capacities of eps are correlated with proteins polysaccharides and humic substances content because of the presence of functional groups such as carboxylates hydroxyls and amines guibaud 2003 lesmana 2009 therefore the masking effect of the structure of mineral eps associations on the characterization of various organic materials and functional groups was nonnegligible and it is difficult to detect the eps transformation by spectroscopic and chromatographic measurements hence we did the acid treatment of eps for deprotonation i e ion exchange before 3deem ftir and gpc analysis in detail taking half of the supernatant obtained by the last step of formaldehyde plus naoh method the solution was adjusted to ph 4 with 3 mol l 1 hcl standing in 4 c for more than 10 h for complete deprotonation after separation by centrifugation the remaining sediment was repeated to ph adjustment ph 4 and static settlement for another 10 h these operations were performed with reference to international humic substances society 1996 and liu et al 2015 pronk et al 2017 finally the acid soluble and insoluble parts were remixed and the regenerated cellulose dialysis bags were used to cut off those mw 3500 da mainly metal ions and then they had freeze drying tf fd 1 freeze dryer nade zhejiang china for prior to analysis 2 3 extracellular polymeric substance analysis methods the extracted eps was further quantified in terms of humic acids proteins and polysaccharides the concentration of protein and humic acids were analyzed using a enzyme labeled instrument elx800 biotek us following the modified lowry method frolund b et al 1995 whereas the polysaccharide content was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 freeze dried eps samples were dissolved as 1 mg with 10 ml ultrapure water and adjusted to ph 8 0 with 1 mol l 1 naoh the aqueous dom samples extracted in section 2 2 were also prepared for fluorescence measurement then 3deem spectra were measured on a hitachi f 7000 fluorescence spectrometer hitech high technologies tokyo japan at room temperature the eem spectra were gathered by scanning em spectra from 300 to 550 nm at 4 nm increments and varying the ex wavelength from 240 to 380 nm at 2 nm increments the spectra were obtained at a scan rate of 1200 nm min 1 using ex and em slit bandwidths of 5 nm the molecular weight mw distribution of eps samples adjusted to ph 8 0 was determined using a high performance liquid chromatograph 1260 infinity agilent santa clara ca usa equipped with a pl aquagel oh mixed m column 8 μm 300 7 5 mm agilent and a refractive index detector as for fourier transform infrared ftir spectra a mixture of 1 2 mg of freeze dried eps and 100 mg of potassium bromide kbr ir grade was ground and pressed to obtain pellets after using a spectrometer nicolet 5700 nicolet waltham ma usa to scan from 400 to 4000 cm 1 the sum of the ftir absorbance were normalizing and multiplying by 1000 subsequently 2d correlation spectroscopy was conducted by 2dshige software kwansei gakuin university japan electrochemical measurements were conducted using the electrochemistry workstation chi 760e chenhua shanghai china with a conventional three electrode cell in a anoxic conditions n2 atmosphere at 25 1 c briefly a graphite plate electrode was used as the working electrode and a pt wire 3 mm diameter and an ag agcl

as test plant among the most sensitive plant species recommended by most of the previous reports himanen et al 2012 phytotoxicity tests were conducted according to the iso 11269 2 standard iso 2008 and the national standard of the people s republic of china gb t 23486 2009 for sludge disposal from the municipal wastewater treatment in summary sludge extracts were prepared by shaking 8 g sludge

had as shown in table 2 the vs ts decreased sharply in the start up period from 48 54 had 1d to 44 57 had 8d resulting from intensive organic decomposition by anaerobic microbes and then vs ts reduced slightly during the last 24 days the total degradation rate of sludge organic matter reached 56 61 according to koch et al 2009 in consistent with previous studies dong et al 2013 duan et al 2012 shao et al 2013 the average biogas yield produced from the digesters was 716 ml g 1 vsremoval or 420 ml g 1 vsadded which is consistent with previous results of biogas production dong et al 2013 xue et al 2015 and therein carbon emissions of ch4 and co2 accounted for 94 5 of the total organic carbon degradation see detail calculation below table s1 in supplement information highly meeting the carbon balance guo and dai 2017 the daily biogas production based on vs degradation i e dbp shifted rapidly to the 162 0 ml g 1 vsremoval in had 2d and then continuously turned down to the end the vfa of substrate had drastic shift in first 2 days and rapid reduction from 6 106 to 0 808 mg g 1 in day 2 12 in conjunction with final value of 0 307 mg g 1 indicating the efficient transformation of the acidogenic product so as to having low impact on anaerobic system moreover the high concentration of free nh3 typically from the enhanced anaerobic mineralization of proteinaceous substance with solid content increase is able to contribute more alkalinity and ph growth duan et al 2012 therefore great buffering capacity made slight ph changes and a small rebound during the final 16 days explicable the quick increase of ec from 1 724 ms cm 1 had 1d to the highest level of 2 519 ms cm 1 had 8d imply the intense salinity accumulation li et al 2016 while later the ec drop ended up with 1 310 ms cm 1 had 28d was primarily attributed to the loss of soluble salts by microbial immobilization and or the formation of insoluble salts e g by chelating humic substances bustamante et al 2012 the germination index gi as the important indicator of digestate phytotoxicity significantly recovered from 29 had 12d to final 73 had 28d suggesting the remarkable stabilization progress himanen et al 2012 li et al 2016 tang et al 2018 3 2 chemical compositions of eps from high solid digestate as the had proceeded the total eps of vs decreased from 645 2 4 3 had 1d to 493 6 1 3 had 8d and then increased again to 645 2 3 2 mg had 28d table 3 the lessened eps concentration in the initial 8 days could be explained by the biodegradation of protein pn and polysaccharide ps as a promising carbon and energy source for cell growth in comparation the eps variation in traditional anaerobic treatment was previously reported to end up with a final downward due to nutrient shortage but the eps decrease belong to had appeared and finished much earlier ye et al 2018b high eps concentration is expected to govern to a certain extent the stability of microbial aggregates hence the distinct rebound of eps during had 12 28d would result in greater sludge stability mikkelsen and nielsen 2001 moreover as the organic load rate increasing duan et al 2012 total eps content in this study was the 4 6 times higher than those of low solid methanogenic sludges liu and fang 2002 which was consistent with the results in previous reports an et al 2017 wang et al 2016b furthermore the efficient eps recovery after the drastic consumption in the first 8 days seemed to firmly bound with the changes of proteinaceous materials the initial predominance of pn in the eps is likely due to the presence of a large quantity of exoenzymes frolund b et al 1995 and precisely because the protein binding structures in eps destroyed and hydrolyzed the original hs were allowed to expose from 19 78 had 1d to 22 91 had 8d moreover during had 12 28d the pn proportion evidently enhanced from 37 78 to 48 39 with small drop of ps by 2 04 while the humic substances hs declined from 21 2 to 17 13 comparatively the final percent of pn was higher than that found in the extracted eps of low solid methanogenic sludges 41 whereas hs was obviously lower than the level of 22 8 as previously reported liu and fang 2002 highlighting the greater concentration of pn in eps during had 3 3 interactions between eps transformation and genetically annotated metabolic evolution during had process 3 3 1 evidences of eps reconstruction during had process 3 3 1 1 three dimensional 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy two major components of eps in high solid digestate were detected in eem plots fig 1 peak a and b were identified at excitation emission ex em wavelengths around 289 294 378 383 nm and 325 468 nm respectively which are described as aromatic amino acid e g tryptophan associated to protein like substances pn and humic like substances hs chen et al 2003 the intensity of fluorescent peak a reached to its highest value in had 2d and then drastically turned down to the lowest in had 8d suggesting the intense protein hydrolysis and biodegradation the intensity of hs peak exhibited the small bulge in had 2d and then created a slight growth while pn was decreasing during had 4 8d implying the relative release of hs at the beginning of had then the intensity of pn continuously enhanced to had 28d whereas that of hs declined to the end after reaching its highest in had 12d it is worth noting that the overall decrease of hs seemed to be in contradiction with the commonly assumed refractory characteristics of hs in fact few authors have ever reported an increase in the total amount of hs during the anaerobic treatment of sewage sludge in the view of soil microbiology hs are able to be biodegraded by anaerobic microbes before neo humic production dou and wang 2011 indeed our previous work regards of structural transformation of the humic acid like molecules ha in had process determined the consumption of ha especially in the start up stage suggesting ha in rs are still unstable that could be decomposed as carbon resource though later the aromatic regeneration in ha has also been observed tang et al 2018 in this experiment in the case of initial rapid decrease of volatile solids and total eps content the growth of hs proportion in eps from 19 78 had 1d to 22 91 had 8d as well as the corresponding fluorescent intensity confirm its relative difficulty of degradation by microorganism on the other hand considering the cross linked hs and pn in eps the drastic decomposition of original protein like fraction coagulated in hs may contribute to the total reduction of hs and further aromatic hs core exposure making the initial release of aromatic groups in hs and the decline in total amount explicable however during the last 20 day had the vs ts reduction slowed down with the rebounds of eps concentration and pn percentage hs turned to decrease ending with the lowest level 17 13 in eps in consequence the total consumption of volatile solids and the redistribution in sludge eps determine hs changes in had further molecular investigations are shown in next paragraphs 3 3 1 2 mw distribution the weight average molecular weight mw distribution of eps provides information about the configuration profile fig 2 at the early stage the intensive eps deflocculation and degradation were primarily shown by the accumulated fraction of mw 45 kda by 7 209 during had 1 8d and the obvious downward of those 100 300 kda in had 8d the smaller and smaller molecular substances could be used as carbon and energy source for cell growth duan et al 2014 more et al 2014 nevertheless during the last 20 days as the eps decomposition and vs ts removal slowed down tables 2 and 3 the eps fraction of mw 45 kda evidently rebounded by 15 250 and the super macromolecules characterized with 100 kda regenerated from 50 556 to 65 926 as previously reported the extended eps molecules involve more adsorption points and stronger bridging resulted in polymerization and structural stability of sludge particulate xu et al 2017 2018 moreover the proportion of 20 45 kda almost changed simultaneously with hs while the variation of molecules 100 kda especially 300 kda greatly attributed to pn which were consistent with previous studies duan et al 2014 li et al 2012 compared to the low solid culture zhang et al 2016 the high solid condition seemingly to be beneficial to a rapid eps reconstruction composed of high molecules 3 3 1 3 elemental analysis change in elemental composition and atomic ratios of eps are shown in table 3 and fig 3 a carbon c and hydrogen h had severe consumptions from 33 371 to 5 493 had 1d to 28 465 and 4 543 had 8d and then both c and h rose back to 33 887 and 5 273 had 28d respectively having the lower level than that of rs 2 282 the h c molar ratio had twice drop from 1 975 had 1d to the lowest value of 1 867 had 28d the decrease of h content and h c ratio indicate the dehydration or unsaturation from a carboxyl or carbonyl group wang et al 2019 combining the lysis and destruction of most protein binding structures the relative hs release during had 1 8d confirmed the enhanced aromaticity in eps lü et al 2017 further though hs content actually tended to be less and less during had 8 28d the repolymerization of aromatic structures in hs may induce the second larger drop of h c tang et al 2018 on the other hand after the obvious nitrogen content n loss 3 585 the n growth of 1 981 and the c n drop from 6 699 to 5 698 in final 20 days represented the relative increased nitrogen containing compounds e g proteins to carbon containing compounds e g carbohydrates and lipids wang et al 2019 moreover the declined h c and c n could also pointed out the polycondensation of proteinaceous substrates and aromatic amino acids in neo humic structures amir et al 2006 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 see fig 4 3 3 1 4 electrochemical analysis eps have been reported to act as endogenous redox mediators to participate metabolisms in which mainly donated by functional groups of carboxyl phenol hydroxyl amine and quinine groups in eps ye et al 2018a 2018b the electron exchange capacity and redox activity were measured fig 3b the electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc exhibited the initial loss to 9 56 and 9 67 μmol e g 1 c in had 2d and then both generally increased to the highest levels of 10 75 and 10 54 μmol e g 1 c in had 8d and had 12d respectively later the continuous declinations of eac and edc ended up with 9 93 and 9 80 μmol e g 1 c had 28d considering eps transformation discussed above the sudden eec loss in had 2d may be primally caused by the intense eps decomposition evidenced by reduced eps content weak fraction of mw 20 45 kda and sharp consumption of nitrogen and carbon resource then the values of eac and edc were almost equal and both significantly enhanced during had 2 12d at the same period the content and fluorescent intensity of hs also had the strong increase trends more redox active mediators such as hs particularly in tight bound eps could accelerate the interspecies electron transfer process between syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea which highlighted the hs release and exposure as extracellular electron shuttles promoting methane production jie and andreas 2008 li et al 2013 finally the eec turned down to the lowest value highly explained by hs decrease and eps repolymerization regarding to op and rp the absolute values of oxidation and reduction peaks the smaller values the more likely the redox actions in eps are able to occur as shown in fig 3b the op and rp declined from 0 436v to 1 019v had 1d to 0 358v and 0 997v had 8d while later their reinforcements reached to 0 512v and 1 073v as the highest points had 28d in addition the end op and rp were even higher than that of rs 0 458v and 1 061v results imply eps could be oxidized and reduced most easily in the middle stage of had but finally the oxidation and reaction became more difficult to happen than that in rs describing the structural stabilization of high solid digestate 3 3 1 5 ftir 2d correlation spectroscopy the chemical structure of humic substances is very complex with multiple carboxyl and phenolic functional groups stevenson 1994 further the humic substances system in eps is formed through the association of several components during the humification process such as amino acids lignin pectin or carbohydrates through inter molecular forces donor acceptor ionic hydrophilic and hydrophobic more et al 2014 the sign of the cross peak in the synchronous map was positive indicating that conformational change was in the same direction chen et al 2015 asynchronous map could not only facilitate the deconvolution of overlapping peaks but also present the useful information about the sequential relationship between different redox groups ye et al 2018a the signs of the cross peaks in the synchronous map associated with 1648 1104 1536 and 976 cm 1 were positive demonstrating the corresponding groups of amide i and or aromatic ring structure polysaccharides amide ii and aromatic hydrocarbon showed conformational change in the same direction as the result the early release aromatic groups attributed to hs seemed to be active with polysaccharides together with metabolites from proteins according to asynchronous map the eps transformation degree or susceptibility over time as the followed sequence 1180 1000 1081 1397 1513 1585 1704 988 1531 1650 cm 1 illustrating the eps transformation changed as the routine c oh and c o associated with amino acids and or polysaccharides c o c ring vibrations and c oh stretches derived from polysaccharides coo stretches associated with amino acids and carboxylic acid co nh of amide ii unsaturated and aromatic cc aromatic aldehydes and carboxyl groups aromatic hydrocarbon co nh of amide ii amide i materials and aromatic ring structures noda and ozaki 2005 therefore after the polysaccharides were highly consumed with proteins those unsaturated and aromatic structure have been further proved to reconstruct forming new hs with abundant carboxylic groups combined chemical and spectroscopic evidence discussed above the process of destruction decomposition and repolymerization in eps during high solid anaerobic biotransformation might be descripted first of all as hs and pn accumulation in eps from sludge endogenous consumption after sedimentation and or dewatering henze et al 2008 the highly cross linked structures and the spatial interaction between components in eps of high solid sludge can be further verified more et al 2014 sheng et al 2010 xu et al 2017 2018 when the mineralization of proteinaceous substrate shifted with solid content increase during anaerobic treatment an et al 2017 hao et al 2016 wang et al 2016b yu 2018 the hs release from eps at the beginning of had was considerable considering hs exposure acted as the electron shuttle body without selectivity thus once the proteolytic launch towards eps deconstruction successful subsequent humic release is able to follow up by aiding electron transfer and energy metabolism then the initial hs release and aromatic amino acids from pn degradation prepare for neo humic formation and hs repolymerization amir et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 therefore the original hs in eps collected from endogenous residual could be degraded and modified moreover the enlarged hs with abundant aromatic sites may also bridge pn condensation xu et al 2017 2018 finally achieving eps reconstruction 3 3 2 functional role of humification on methanogenesis and eps reconstruction 3 3 2 1 rda analysis redundancy analysis rda was used to investigate the correlations among eps composition process performance of eps characteristics and the major metabolic evolution demonstrated by rpkm abundance changes of top 10 kegg modules fig 5 the functional annotation and changes of top 10 can be referenced in fig 6 the first two modules were m00178 ribosome and m00359 aminoacyl trna biosynthesis both responsible to translation following as m00009 citrate cycle and m00001 glycolysis about the carbohydrate metabolism the next group was classified as the membrane transport including abc 2type m00254 branched chain amino acid m00237 peptides nickel m00239 and putative multiple sugar m00207 and the last two modules were m00144 nadh quinone oxidoreductase prokaryotes and m00048 inosine monophosphate biosynthesis roughly except the obvious upregulation of member transport during had 8 28d most other top 10 modules reduced after initial slight increase or decrease rda 1 and rda 2 explained 93 24 total variation of the module abundance and diversity hs content in eps p 0 013 had the most significant correlation on the distribution of gene based modules implying hs played the crucial role in metagenomic regulation during the stabilization process in had yang et al 2016 top 10 modules were clearly divided into two clusters that were close to daily biogas production i e dbp and gi respectively because the angles between arrows indicate correlations between two variables besides hs together with pn exhibited in both fig 5a and b in highly reverse direction the other 8 vectors were divided into two groups according to their relationship to dbp and gi yang et al 2016 with positive relationship with dbp h c and c n in eps distributed in the same quadrant with the modules about translation and energy metabolisms involving m00001 glycolysis m00009 citrate cycle m00178 ribosome m00359 amino trna biosynthesis m00144 nadh quinone oxidoreductase and m00048 inosine monophosphate fig 5a as previously reported the ultimate methane yield has evident negative relations with the reduction of h content and h c in pretreated eps which suggest it is much possible that dehydration of hydrogen bonding networks improve the methane production lü et al 2017 besides the abundant nitrogen content n and the n c ratio in lightly bound eps were important for the initial methane production rate lü et al 2017 suggesting the initial biogas production may prefer n containing resource considering h c decline and c n strength related positively to hs but negatively to pn in this study the anaerobic biotreatment for methane release may precisely attributed to the dehydration and consumption of protein binding hydrogen bonding networks simultaneously the humic structures release from eps brought about the relative higher aromaticity and lower h c moreover hs is the major factor shifting electron exchange capacity i e eec in eps to reduce the energy requirement for electrons transition of a series of microbial energy metabolism involved in redox reactions wang et al 2018 thus the dramatic consumption of pn typically embodied as rapid decline of h and n contents and efficient biogas release could be facilitated by initial active hs release lovley 2017 lovley et al 1996 having the intensive sludge degradation our previous research found excessive organic and or inorganic salts accumulated under this high load condition mostly caused the sludge ecotoxicity but later aromatic repolymerization of hs could reduce phytotoxicity to some extent tang et al 2018 interesting in this study the most direct executor of salinity immobilization seemed to be the proteolytic condensation in detail towards the final direction of gi improvement the content of pn increased while hs decreased together with redox activity inhibition fig 5b meanwhile the pn condensation and eps reconstruction could be observed according to functional transport systems of putative multiple sugar peptides nickel branched chain amino acid and abc 2 type m00207 m00239 m00237 m00254 significantly recovered during had 12 28d fig 5b the modules mentioned exhibited much larger enhancement than other modules during final 16 day had fig 6a and more modules of transport systems of putative simple sugar m00221 oligopeptide m00439 and iron complex m00240 with similar changes accumulated together with pn op rp and gi fig 5b since the op and rp became higher the redox activities were more difficult to occur speculatively pn repolymerization might limit oxidative and reductive activities in eps though which seemingly to promote gi hence the significant c n loss together with pn rebound were consistent underlying that n containing compounds were substantially increased with the growth of polymerization degree in eps wang et al 2018 further as the most significant factor for module distribution the aromatic regeneration in hs may bridge pn repolymerization preventing from further sludge degradation and serve phytotoxicity 3 3 2 2 spearman correlations coefficient significance rank test spearman correlations coefficient tests were applied for further determining specific dependencies between eps transformation and major metabolic classification in which the top 30 modules fig 6a as well as the top 20 metabolic pathways predicted by level 3 kegg ortholog function fig 6b were discussed as the representative indicator of two aspects towards sludge stabilization dbp and gi obviously led two groups of eps characteristics having different correlation results no matter with modules and level 3 functions the positive effects of c n h c hs and eec on dbp were proven again in detail having the strongest correlation with dbp h c significantly related to translation pathways fig 6b and energy metabolism modules fig 6a of methanogenesis m00357 lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis m00060 glycolysis m00001 and phospholipid transport system m00210 the amino acid and peptide biosynthesis were responsible for the close relation between hs and c n fig 6a mainly including valine isoleucine biosynthesis m00019 nitt taut family transport system m00188 tryptophan biosynthesis m00023 leucine biosynthesis m00432 and heme biosynthesis m00121 those biosynthesis of amino acids might prepared for hs regeneration together with the screened origin aromatic structures as precursors tang et al 2018 though total hs content in eps also strikingly decreased in this study ye et al 2018b in addition similar correlation results on iron complex transport system m00240 and heme biosynthesis m00121 linked hs and eec while the signal transduction provided the linkage between h c and hs indicating hs in eps might play both chemical and biological roles on functional metabolism as for those factors related to gi improvement the pn recovery redox activity inhibition and ps reduction were mainly explained by enhanced member transport systems of peptides nickel branched chain amino acid abc 2 type putative multiple sugar putative simple sugar and oligopeptide m00239 m00237 m00254 m00207 m00221 and m00439 together with iron complex m00240 fig 6a as shown in fig 6b the notable negative correlations with translation and energy metabolism belong to pn and op rebound interestingly regarding to peptidoglycan biosynthesis gi had a great correlation and pn op and rp showed weaker positive relations while eec and hs related negatively with that highly confirming pn have a higher binding strength and capability than hs more et al 2014 taken into consideration that the signal transduction of two component system and quorum sensing strongly related to hs fig 6b it is likely the regeneration of aromatic structures in hs exerted as the specific signal driving various biopolymers to embody in hs in a special polymerized form in other words the humification is a process in which various substances are prepared for synthesizing macromolecules with similar properties to them dou et al 2016 functionally the reconstruction of hs in eps with more unsaturated structures wang et al 2018 bridged pn repolymerization and complexes with metal cations within the exopolymeric matrix gupta and diwan 2017 sajjad et al 2017 sheng et al 2013 hence with fade oxidation and polyphenolic condensation shao et al 2013 the relative passive humification stimulated pn repolymerization in eps for self defense which made the release of carbohydrate more difficult and reduced phytotoxicity achieving greatly comprehensive sludge stabilization during high solid ad provenzano et al 2016 ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 in general besides the bridging effect hs repolymerization actually also act as a signal for cellular defense during the period of anaerobic sludge stabilization which stimulate pn condensation by regulating amino acids biosynthesis member transport systems and etc 4 conclusion first of all as the major component in eps pn directly execute the sludge stabilization process in had since pn decomposition of eps serve for methane production and proteolytic condensation could prevent from further sludge degradation and phytotoxicity aggravation however the actual progress of sludge stabilization depends on the humification process understanding the essential roles of hs release on unstable organic degradation by facilitating energy metabolism especially those based on proteinaceous substrate and noticing the meditated effects of hs regeneration on eps reconstruction by providing aromatic core structures and stimulating self defense mechanism are of great implication for systematical sludge stabilization under high organic load and further biomass resource recovery thus new strategies such as stimulating hs growth in eps for improving redox activity by e g hematite of red mud addition ye et al 2018b or alternating active humic exposure and enhancing pn degradation by e g intermittent micro aeration on
