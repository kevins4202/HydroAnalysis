effect on the hydrodynamic characteristic for jack up platform keywords jack up platform hydrodynamic coefficient wave tank test influencing factors 1 introduction jack up platforms are commonly found in the costal or offshore environment for offshore oil and gas recovering which are always suffering from the wind current and waves in jack up structure and foundation designs the accurate prediction of wave and current forces is important but difficult for the assessment of hydrodynamic forces of jack up structure some institutions provide useful empirical approach such as abs 2011 dnv 2012 sname 2007 recommended practice etc however when calculating the hydrodynamic force acting on the jack up platform structure it is usually necessary to simplify the model which results in inaccurate hydrodynamic calculation results and affects the evaluation accuracy of rack structure strength at present there is no general method for accurate calculation of pile leg hydrodynamics of jack up platform lee et al 2009 li et al 2018 tian et al 2019 therefore it is of great theoretical value and practical significance to measure the wave load on the chord of jack up platform by model test and to calculate its hydrodynamic coefficients most research about hydrodynamic load on ocean structures have been concentrated mostly on circular cross section members and relatively limited work has been carried out on other cross sections sarpkaya 1975 found that the periodicity of waves had a great impact on cd and cm coefficients through experiments chakrabarti 1979 measured the wave forces of two three and five piles arranged in parallel and spaced 4 10 times the diameter of the pile center in the wave tank which found that the hydrodynamic coefficient depends on kc number and relative pile spacing yuan and huang 2010 studied the inertia and drag coefficients for a truncated circular cylinder by experimental method bonakdar and oumeraci 2015 investigated the pile group effect on the wave loading of slender pile liu et al 2007 experimentally investigated wave current forces on the pile group of base foundation for the east sea bridge li and lin 2010 proposed a two dimensional numerical tank to simulate the coaction process to investigate the hydrodynamic coefficients induced by waves and currents tian et al 2018 also proposed a three dimensinal numerical tank to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of cylinders tian et al 2018 huang and sworn 2013 investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients of two fixed circular cylinders in a flume jagadeesh et al 2009 presented a towing tank base experimental study on the hydrodynamic force coefficients over auv hull form carlos and antonio 2015 investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients of semi submersible floating offshore wind turbine by experiment and numerical simulation venugopal et al 2006 investigated the wave force coefficients for horizontally submerged rectangular cylinders in the towing tank jack up leg sections are complex structures usually made of slender members the best engineering tool available for computation of hydrodynamic forces is morison equation the determination of hydrodynamic coefficients is the first step and towing tank test using a reduce scale model is a good method for determining the hydrodynamic coefficients as shown in the previous literatures liu et al 2007 li and lin 2010 huang and sworn 2013 li et al 2018 also the scale model tests were conducted in our previous work tian et al 2017 however jack up leg sections are complex lattice structures as shown in fig 1 usually made of slender members usually the hydrodynamic modeling of a jack up leg may be carried out by utilizing the equivalent model with a certain scale ratio ignoring the rack members also the wave incident angle and the selection of scale ratio both generate influences on the hydrodynamic coefficients in this study only the chord member is used as the research object to investigate the effects of scale ratio rack and wave incident orientation on hydrodynamic characteristic the experimental methodology is described in section 2 and the experimental models experiment setup and arrangement are all designed the values of drag and inertia coefficients are obtained from the wave tank tests in section 3 the influence of factors on the hydrodynamic coefficients are discussed in section 4 and conclusions are given in the last section 2 experimental methodology 2 1 experiment models considering various affecting factors two series of models including smooth chord and chord with rack were designed referring to fig 1 according to the actual size of the single chord and the test tank models with different sizes are determined four scale ratios containing 1 1 1 2 1 5 and 1 10 are introduced and the details of experiment models are shown in table 1 the length of models are all 1200 mm the 1 1 model is designed at 450 mm outer diameter other models are designed according to the corresponding scales for models with rack the rack sizes pitch modulus and width are determined according to the actual size of jack up platform due to the gravity effect of experimental model lighter material is appropriate for making the model which is easier for the operator to install and change the model during performing different experiments pmma polymethyl methacrylate is adopted in this experiment in order to verify the model strength during the experiment a series of experimental model simulations are conducted by abaqus under the extreme experimental conditions the results showed that the pmma pipe models could meet the experimental intensity requirements models with different scale ratios are shown in fig 2 the smooth chord model is made directly by the pmma pipe the chord model with rack is made by pmma pipe bonging with the rack structure which is also manufactured based on the geometrical similarity principle the top and bottom of models should be sealed to prevent water entering in addition the model top has holes to connect with the instrument 2 2 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in the re circulating wave flume located at key laboratory of ocean engineering ocean university of china as shown in fig 3 the flume was 30 m long 3 m wide and 1 5 m deep which constructed of concrete with four glass windows for observation the high power water pump was installed on both ends of the flume to generate the maximum flow velocity of 0 8 m s a wave generator at one end to achieve different waves the maximum wave height of 25 cm and the wave periods varied from 1s to 2s at the other end a parabolic type passive absorber is installed to absorb the energy of incident wave and minimize wave inflection at the end of the flume a test platform was set up according to the conditions of laboratory and the geometric characteristics of chord model as shown in fig 3 a set of frame structure is firmly installed on the top of wave flume to fix the entire experiment device to avoid any possible wave or current induced mechanical vibrations and movements during experiments the chord model is installed below the frame the six dimensional force sensor metal adapter plate and flanges are all located between the frame and model they constitute the whole experimental system together the experimental device was set 10 m downstream of the wave generator a capacitance type wave gauge is installed 2 6 m upstream of the test platform which is used to measure the incoming wave properties such as wave height h and wave period t a flow velocity transducer is positioned on a line parallel to measure the incoming current velocity 2 3 experimental design arrangements experiments are divided into current experiment group and wave experiment group the experiment measurements were carried out based on current velocity wave parameter and incident angle five current parameters five wave parameters and four incidence angles are designed as list in table 2 the current varied from 0 1 m s to 0 5 m s in a 0 1 m s increment wave height varied from 5 cm to 20 cm and wave period varied from 1s to 2s for the incident angle it is only reflected on the chord model with rack to further confirm the impact of wave incident angle on the hydrodynamic coefficients four different angles 0 30 45 90 are defined as showed in fig 4 in detail according to fig 3 the water depth was fixed at 1 2 m for all chord model tests with the action of wave and current load the force act on the chord model can be measured and converted into electrical signal by six dimensional force sensor and then electrical signal can be recorded in a computer by using the data acquisition system dh5902 collector at the same time wave and current signals are both recorded by the data acquisition system during experiment each experiment is carried out at least three times to ensure the validity and reliability of the experimental data the drag coefficient cd and inertia coefficient cm were computed from the forces measured during the experiments the wave height meter measures the wave height at a sampling frequency of 10 hz and the six dimensional force sensor measures wave forces at a sampling frequency of 100 hz 3 analysis methods considering the large number of experimental groups and huge amount of data only take the experimental data of 1 2 smooth chord model for example to explain the data processing as shown in fig 5 fig 5a illustrate the current load of 1 2 smooth model under 0 1 m s current velocity and fig 5b illustrate the wave load under 5 cm wave height and 1s wave period the experimental load and bending moment in the three dimensions of models can be collected by the six dimensional force sensor in order to make it clearer to collect the main data the experimental moment data is not displayed moreover the displayed data in fig 5 are captured when the current load is relatively stable in which the red curve is the longitudinal force f x along the direction of the wave flow the blue curve is the transverse force f y perpendicular to the direction of the wave flow and the green part is the vertical force f z it can be seen that f x is relatively stable so the average value of the load during this period can be taken as the current load value under this condition f y is zero because the model is not subjected to force in the direction perpendicular to the wall due to the model is stressed in the vertical direction due to the interaction of gravity and buoyancy the model is affected by the current of ocean currents therefore the force of f z in the vertical direction of the model is not zero however this study only analyzes the stress load of the model in the wave flow direction so f z is not considered the current load under steady flow can be calculated by eq 1 which is provided by ccs the wave load is often solved by morrison equation which is a semi theoretical and semi empirical formula as shown in eq 2 1 f d c d ρ 2 v 2 a 2 f m 1 2 ρ c d a u x u x ρ c m v u x where f d is current load ρ is fluid density v is flow velocity and a is the area of the model in a plane perpendicular to the flow direction f m is wave load v is the displacement volume u x and u x are the horizontal velocity and horizontal acceleration of the water quality point respectively eq 1 is used to calculate current force in the engineering design current is assumed as steady flow so the current force acting on the cylinder only contains drag force cd would be obtained from the current test data according to eq 1 as long as the current force and current velocity is known eq 2 is used to calculate the wave force of small scale structures wave force is composed by drag force and inertia force the drag force is caused by friction resistance which is proportional to the square of water point horizontal velocity the inertia force is the additional mass force produced by the inertia of water flow which is proportional to the horizontal acceleration of the water quality point cm would be obtained from the wave test data according to eq 2 as long as cd wave load and wave conditions have been known both cd and cm are dependent on reynolds numbers re and keulegan carpenter numbers kc among them re is a dimensionless number used to characterize fluid flow and used to determine the resistance to flow of an object in a fluid which is mainly related to cd it can be expressed by eq 3 3 r e v d γ where d is the dimension of the cylinder normal to wave crests and γ is the kinematic viscosity kc number is also a dimensionless number describing the relationship between viscous forces and inertial forces on an object in an oscillating flow field which is mainly related to cm it can be expressed by eq 4 4 k c u m t d where u m is the maximum horizontal particle velocity at the elevation of the center of the test section and t is the wave period the present tests were carried out with the assumption that the linear wave theory is valid to predict the water particle kinematics under random waves at the axis of the cylinder it was further assumed that the reflection from the beach and sidewalls of the tank has negligible effects on the measured water surface profile and forces on the cylinder 4 results and discussion 4 1 the effect of scale ratio the effect of scale ratio is shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6a that the current loads of cylinder model are all increasing with the increasing of current velocity under various scale ratios this trend is coincident with the current load equation as shown in eq 1 fig 6b shows the relationship between scale ratio and cd in different current velocities when the current velocity is 0 1 m s cd increases with the scale ratio increasing whereas cd first increases and then decreases with the scale ratio increasing while the current velocity is larger than 0 1 m s as previously discussed the drag coefficient is dependent on the reynolds number and this has been reported by several authors li and zhang 1986 chakrabarti et al 1976 sarpkaya 1977 cd is relevant with re and the change trend in fig 6 can be explained by reynolds number the re value under different current velocities and scale ratios can be calculated by eq 3 and the relationship of cd and re is drawn in fig 7 it can be seen that cd is first increasing and then decreasing tending to a constant with re increasing which is almost consistent with the researchers in refs sarpkaya and storm 1985 iwagaki and asano 1983 the curve can be divided into two sections by the re turning point at about 5 104 the first section is less than 5 104 in which the fluid boundary layer from stagnation point to separation point is laminar flow because the separation occurs before the maximum width of the cylinder wide wake and low foundation pressure lead to considerable resistance coefficient the second part is greater than 5 104 and the resistance in this area suddenly decreases because of the boundary layer transition happens just in front of the separation point due to the turbulent boundary layer it can be further extended to the region of negative pressure gradient before the separation occurs which leads to the narrowing of wake and the reduction of resistance coefficient with the further increase of re the resistance coefficient tends to be constant garrison 1989 in fig 6b when the current velocity is 0 1 m s re values under different scale ratios are all less than 5 104 and located in the first sections therefore cd increases with the scale ratio increasing when the current velocity is greater than 0 2 m s the change trend of cd is basically the same for different current velocities and the range of re values are all between 8 48 103 to 2 12 105 which bestrides two sections therefore the change trend of cd is first increasing and then decreasing it can be concluded that the effect of scale ratio on cd is depend on reynolds number in this particular experiment when the scale ratio is no less than 1 2 and the current velocity is no less than 0 4 m s re is greater than 5 104 which can ensure that the measured cd value is more accurate fig 8 shows the effect of scale ratio on cm under different wave conditions the wave load of model is increasing with the scale ratio increasing this trend is coincident with the wave load equation as shown in eq 2 fig 8b shows the relationship between scale ratio and cm in different wave conditions it can be seen that cm is scattered distribution and seems to be no laws however the values of cm for different scale ratios are concentrated and have little gap except for the large wave height and period condition for h 20 cm t 2s the result has larger gap than other results because that the cylinder model under the large wave height and period condition the vortex around model is serious reflection from the beach and sidewalls of the tank is more evident and the vibration of model is more severe therefore the error of the test data is much greater overall the range of cm is from 1 88 to 2 19 where an inertia coefficient cm 2 0 for smooth cylinders is suggested for use in some recommended practice abs 2011 ccs 2012 the kc numbers under different wave conditions and scale ratios can be calculated by eq 4 the relationship of kc and cm is illustrated in fig 9 it can be seen that the change of cm is very small for little kc numbers when kc is larger than 4 cm fist decreases and then increases to a constant value with kc increasing which is almost consistent with the results of keylegan and carpenter 1958 and sarpkaya 1975 on the whole cm value has little differences under the existing experimental conditions it can be conclude that scale ratio has little effect on the inertia coefficient for kc between 0 and 15 4 2 the effect of rack the effect of rack is shown in fig 10 only the rack model with 0 flow direction is used to compare with smooth model considering different scale ratios the relationship between current load and velocity for rack model and smooth model are all drawn in fig 10a it can be seen that current load with rack are generally greater than that of smooth model for the same scale ratio it is obviously that rack factor increases the current load of structure accordingly cd value increases a lot for the rack model which is about 1 14 2 37 while the value of smooth model is about 0 73 1 15 it can be known from eq 1 that current load has a great relationship with the current velocity and shadow area rack structures greatly increase the shadow area in the direction perpendicular to the current velocity under the same experiment condition which leads to the current load increasing more importantly rack structures also change the shape of structure which would change the drag coefficient the rack model is approximate for a flat plate for the square shape it has edges and corners therefore water flow separation and vortex shedding would occur under any kc numbers and the drag coefficient of square structure is larger than that of cylinder structure li and zhang 1994 venugopal et al 2006 therefore the existence of rack increases the value of cd obviously and have great impact on cd value fig 11 shows wave load of smooth model and rack model for different scale ratios it is noted that wave load of rack model is larger than that of smooth model due to the rack structure the shadow area is enlarged a lot and the wave load is also enlarged for cm value the relationships are shown in fig 12 the inertia coefficients for two different models have little differences cm value calculated from smooth model is between 1 88 and 2 5 cm value calculated from smooth model is between 1 87 and 2 6 the results show that the cm value is less influenced by both projected area and the shape of the model perpendicular to the flow direction it can be concluded that the model shape only affects the part of drag force and has little influence on the part of inertia force the relationships of cd and re cm and kc are also shown in figs 13 and 14 cd is first increasing and then to the stable value with the which is different from that of fig 7 it may be caused by the factor of rack which changes the shape of model and increases the drag force however the curve of cm and kc is almost the same with fig 9 it can be explained that the change of model shape has little effect on cm 4 3 the effect of wave incident angle the cylinder model with rack have been greatly influenced by the incident angle for different incident angles current load on the model is shown in fig 15 it can be seen that current load under different incident angles is very different load under 0 direction is the largest and load under 90 direction is the smallest with the incident angle changing from 0 to 90 the shadow area is decreasing therefore current load would reduce with the reducing of the shadow area additionally drag coefficient is derived under different incident angles for different scale ratios that the relationship with incident angle is drawn in fig 16 it can be seen that cd decreases with the incident angle changing from 0 to 90 therefore the incident angle not only affects the shadow area but also affects the drag coefficient under all experiment cases cd for 0 are largest which is about 1 9 2 2 however cd for 90 are smallest which is about 0 6 1 7 and very similar with the cylinder model without rack for the 90 direction drag coefficient are dominated by the cylinder part and little particular effect for the rack on the drag coefficient this indicates that the drag coefficients chosen for the tubular are also valid when the split tube chord is 90 direction for the 0 direction the drag coefficient should be similar to that of a flat plate for the interpolation between the directions 0 90 the drag coefficient changes with the angle changing the relationship of incident angle and wave load is shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the wave load is linear with the incident angle under different scale ratios in eq 2 there are two terms that both contribute to the total wave load the first term drag load contains cd and a which mainly affected by the incidence angle the second term inertia load containing cm presents a weak relation with the wave angle later on according to calculate the two terms it is found that drag load is the main part of wave load and much larger than the inertia load the drag load is decreasing with the increasing of incident angle and the inertia load changes a little with the incident angle changing the incident angle could affect the shadow area which leads to the change of drag force therefore the drag force is the main reason of inducing the wave load changing with the incident angle changing however this linear relationship is not very good under some cases such as case 3 and 4 in fig 17a case 4 and 5 in fig 17c case 3 and 4 in fig 17d it is because that under the large wave load the model vibration is very large which induces other forces adding to the force sensor fig 18 shows the relationship between the incident angle and the cm value under different scale ratios cm value is mostly distributed between 1 6 and 2 5 and scatter diagram is used to depict this relationship it can be seen that cm value is fluctuating within a certain range at each angle also cm value under different scale ratios is almost same with that of smooth cylinder model it shows that incident angle has little effect on the inertial coefficient this is also consistent with the results of wave load above the calculation of wave load under different incident angle is only affected by the shadow area and the inertial coefficient could use the value of smooth cylinder without rack 5 conclusions the study focuses on the factors affecting the hydrodynamic coefficients of jack up platform the test platform was set up in the wave tank to research the effect of scale ratio wave incident angle and rack on the drag and inertia coefficients various experiment models are manufactured and a series of experiments are conducted under different current and wave parameters the conclusions are described as follows 1 scale ratio has great effect on the drag coefficient and has little effect on the inertia coefficient for better simulating the actual environment large scale ratio and large current velocity should be considered 2 the rack on cylinder increase the current and wave load greatly which increase the shadow area in the direction perpendicular to the current velocity however the shape of rack structure only increases the value of cd and has little influence on the value of cm 3 the change of incident angle has different influences for the current and wave load and load is almost proportional to the incident angle for different incident angles the drag coefficient is very different but the inertia coefficient has little change 4 the effects of scale ratio rack and incident angle on the hydrodynamic coefficient of jack up platform is very great and not be ignored it is necessary to considering the effects of scale ratio rack and incident angle when determining the drag and inertia coefficients for jack up platform acknowledgment the research was supported by national natural

an object in a fluid which is mainly related to cd it can be expressed by eq 3 3 r e v d γ where d is the dimension of the cylinder normal to wave crests and γ is the kinematic viscosity kc number is also a dimensionless number describing the relationship between viscous forces and inertial forces on an object in an oscillating flow field which is mainly related to cm it can be expressed by eq 4 4 k c u m t d where u m is the maximum horizontal particle velocity at the elevation of the center of the test section and t is the wave period the present tests were carried out with the assumption that the linear wave theory is valid to predict the water particle kinematics under random waves at the axis of the cylinder it was further assumed that the reflection from the beach and sidewalls of the tank has negligible effects on the measured water surface profile and forces on the cylinder 4 results and discussion 4 1 the effect of scale ratio the effect of scale ratio is shown in fig 6 it can be seen from fig 6a that the current loads of cylinder model are all increasing with the increasing of current velocity under various scale ratios this trend is coincident with the current load equation as shown in eq 1 fig 6b shows the relationship between scale ratio and cd in different current velocities when the current velocity is 0 1 m s cd increases with the scale ratio increasing whereas cd first increases and then decreases with the scale ratio increasing while the current velocity is larger than 0 1 m s as previously discussed the drag coefficient is dependent on the reynolds number and this has been reported by several authors li and zhang 1986 chakrabarti et al 1976 sarpkaya 1977 cd is relevant with re and the change trend in fig 6 can be explained by reynolds number the re value under different current velocities and scale ratios can be calculated by eq 3 and the relationship of cd and re is drawn in fig 7 it can be seen that cd is first increasing and then decreasing tending to a constant with re increasing which is almost consistent with the researchers in refs sarpkaya and storm 1985 iwagaki and asano 1983 the curve can be divided into two sections by the re turning point at about 5 104 the first section is less than 5 104 in which the fluid boundary layer from stagnation point to separation point is laminar flow because the separation occurs before the maximum width of the cylinder wide wake and low foundation pressure lead to considerable resistance coefficient the second part is greater than 5 104 and the resistance in this area suddenly decreases because of the boundary layer transition happens just in front of the separation point due to the turbulent boundary layer it can be further extended to the region of negative pressure gradient before the separation occurs which leads to the narrowing of wake and the reduction of resistance coefficient with the further increase of re the resistance coefficient tends to be constant garrison 1989 in fig 6b when the current velocity is 0 1 m s re values under different scale ratios are all less than 5 104 and located in the first sections therefore cd increases with the scale ratio increasing when the current velocity is greater than 0 2 m s the change trend of cd is basically the same for different current velocities and the range of re values are all between 8 48 103 to 2 12 105 which bestrides two sections therefore the change trend of cd is first increasing and then decreasing it can be concluded that the effect of scale ratio on cd is depend on reynolds number in this particular experiment when the scale ratio is no less than 1 2 and the current velocity is no less than 0 4 m s re is greater than 5 104 which can ensure that the measured cd value is more accurate fig 8 shows the effect of scale ratio on cm under different wave conditions the wave load of model is increasing with the scale ratio increasing this trend is coincident with the wave load equation as shown in eq 2 fig 8b shows the relationship between scale ratio and cm in different wave conditions it can be seen that cm is scattered distribution and seems to be no laws however the values of cm for different scale ratios are concentrated and have little gap except for the large wave height and period condition for h 20 cm t 2s the result has larger gap than other results because that the cylinder model under the large wave height and period condition the vortex around model is serious reflection from the beach and sidewalls of the tank is more evident and the vibration of model is more severe therefore the error of the test data is much greater overall the range of cm is from 1 88 to 2 19 where an inertia coefficient cm 2 0 for smooth cylinders is suggested for use in some recommended practice abs 2011 ccs 2012 the kc numbers under different wave conditions and scale ratios can be calculated by eq 4 the relationship of kc and cm is illustrated in fig 9 it can be seen that the change of cm is very small for little kc numbers when kc is larger than 4 cm fist decreases and then increases to a constant value with kc increasing which is almost consistent with the results of keylegan and carpenter 1958 and sarpkaya 1975 on the whole cm value has little differences under the existing experimental conditions it can be conclude that scale ratio has little effect on the inertia coefficient for kc between 0 and 15 4 2 the effect of rack the effect of rack is shown in fig 10 only the rack model with 0 flow direction is used to compare with smooth model considering different scale ratios the relationship between current load and velocity for rack model and smooth model are all drawn in fig 10a it can be seen that current load with rack are generally greater than that of smooth model for the same scale ratio it is obviously that rack factor increases the current load of structure accordingly cd value increases a lot for the rack model which is about 1 14 2 37 while the value of smooth model is about 0 73 1 15 it can be known from eq 1 that current load has a great relationship with the current velocity and shadow area rack structures greatly increase the shadow area in the direction perpendicular to the current velocity under the same experiment condition which leads to the current load increasing more importantly rack structures also change the shape of structure which would change the drag coefficient the rack model is approximate for a flat plate for the square shape it has edges and corners therefore water flow separation and vortex shedding would occur under any kc numbers and the drag coefficient of square structure is larger than that of cylinder structure li and zhang 1994 venugopal et al 2006 therefore the existence of rack increases the value of cd obviously and have great impact on cd value fig 11 shows wave load of smooth model and rack model for different scale ratios it is noted that wave load of rack model is larger than that of smooth model due to the rack structure the shadow area is enlarged a lot and the wave load is also enlarged for cm value the relationships are shown in fig 12 the inertia coefficients for two different models have little differences cm value calculated from smooth model is between 1 88 and 2 5 cm value calculated from smooth model is between 1 87 and 2 6 the results show that the cm value is less influenced by both projected area and the shape of the model perpendicular to the flow direction it can be concluded that the model shape only affects the part of drag force and has little influence on the part of inertia force the relationships of cd and re cm and kc are also shown in figs 13 and 14 cd is first increasing and then to the stable value with the which is different from that of fig 7 it may be caused by the factor of rack which changes the shape of model and increases the drag force however the curve of cm and kc is almost the same with fig 9 it can be explained that the change of model shape has little effect on cm 4 3 the effect of wave incident angle the cylinder model with rack have been greatly influenced by the incident angle for different incident angles current load on the model is shown in fig 15 it can be seen that current load under different incident angles is very different load under 0 direction is the largest and load under 90 direction is the smallest with the incident angle changing from 0 to 90 the shadow area is decreasing therefore current load would reduce with the reducing of the shadow area additionally drag coefficient is derived under different incident angles for different scale ratios that the relationship with incident angle is drawn in fig 16 it can be seen that cd decreases with the incident angle changing from 0 to 90 therefore the incident angle not only affects the shadow area but also affects the drag coefficient under all experiment cases cd for 0 are largest which is about 1 9 2 2 however cd for 90 are smallest which is about 0 6 1 7 and very similar with the cylinder model without rack for the 90 direction drag coefficient are dominated by the cylinder part and little particular effect for the rack on the drag coefficient this indicates that the drag coefficients chosen for the tubular are also valid when the split tube chord is 90 direction for the 0 direction the drag coefficient should be similar to that of a flat plate for the interpolation between the directions 0 90 the drag coefficient changes with the angle changing the relationship of incident angle and wave load is shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the wave load is linear with the incident angle under different scale ratios in eq 2 there are two terms that both contribute to the total wave load the first term drag load contains cd and a which mainly affected by the incidence angle the second term inertia load containing cm presents a weak relation with the wave angle later on according to calculate the two terms it is found that drag load is the main part of wave load and much larger than the inertia load the drag load is decreasing with the increasing of incident angle and the inertia load changes a little with the incident angle changing the incident angle could affect the shadow area which leads to the change of drag force therefore the drag force is the main reason of inducing the wave load changing with the incident angle changing however this linear relationship is not very good under some cases such as case 3 and 4 in fig 17a case 4 and 5 in fig 17c case 3 and 4 in fig 17d it is because that under the large wave load the model vibration is very large which induces other forces adding to the force sensor fig 18 shows the relationship between the incident angle and the cm value under different scale ratios cm value is mostly distributed between 1 6 and 2 5 and scatter diagram is used to depict this relationship it can be seen that cm value is fluctuating within a certain range at each angle also cm value under different scale ratios is almost same with that of smooth cylinder model it shows that incident angle has little effect on the inertial coefficient this is also consistent with the results of wave load above the calculation of wave load under different incident angle is only affected by the shadow area and the inertial coefficient could use the value of smooth cylinder without rack 5 conclusions the study focuses on the factors affecting the hydrodynamic coefficients of jack up platform the test platform was set up in the wave tank to research the effect of scale ratio wave incident angle and rack on the drag and inertia coefficients various experiment models are manufactured and a series of experiments are conducted under different current and wave parameters the conclusions are described as follows 1 scale ratio has great effect on the drag coefficient and has little effect on the inertia coefficient for better simulating the actual environment large scale ratio and large current velocity should be considered 2 the rack on cylinder increase the current and wave load greatly which increase the shadow area in the direction perpendicular to the current velocity however the shape of rack structure only increases the value of cd and has little influence on the value of cm 3 the change of incident angle has different influences for the current and wave load and load is almost proportional to the incident angle for different incident angles the drag coefficient is very different but the inertia coefficient has little change 4 the effects of scale ratio rack and incident angle on the hydrodynamic coefficient of jack up platform is very great and not be ignored it is necessary to considering the effects of scale ratio rack and incident angle when determining the drag and inertia coefficients for jack up platform acknowledgment the research was supported by national natural

22356,the present paper aims at making a research on the ultimate strength and post ultimate strength behaviors of hull plates under extreme longitudinal cyclic load the cyclic load is controlled by displacement at the load edge of the plate to reach both ultimate strength and post ultimate strength stages two load patterns are considered for cyclic compressive and cyclic tensile compressive load the ultimate strength of intact plates in each cycle are found to be close to the unloading points of the previous cycle it is found that not only the overall residual deformation but also the local residual stress and strain formed in cyclic loads will lead to a reduction of the ultimate strength of plates accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage arisen from the extreme cyclic load are discussed in present study the combined effect of accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage on the ultimate strength and post ultimate strength as well as the load path of hull plates is obtained it can be seen as a coupling effect of the two individual ones the mechanical mechanism of strength behaviors in each condition of cyclic loading is analyzed keywords ultimate strength post ultimate strength cyclic load accumulated plastic damage low cycle fatigue damage nonlinear finite element analysis 1 introduction nowadays the traditional allowable working stress criteria is inadequate in ship hull and offshore structure design in order to know the true margin of structure safety development of structural design and strength assessment based on the ultimate strength is very fast and has been listed in some basic standards and rules iacs 2006a b imo 2006 iso 2006 2007 issc 2000 2012 ship hull plates are the basic structural components of hull girders the individual stress strain relationship and ultimate strength of plates is necessary for the progressive collapse analysis of the whole hull girder design it is well recognized that the main external load the hull girder bears in its life time service is wave load hull plates are mainly under repeated axial cyclic loads when bending moments duo to wave load are applied on hull girders accumulated plastic damage during cyclic loads may affect the ultimate strength value of plates therefore research on hull plates under cyclic loads is of great practical significance literatures about steel structures under cyclic load are limited yao and nikolov 1990 proposed that it is also important to know the residual strength of a hull under cyclic loading due to waves after its ultimate strength has been attained under the extreme sea condition it is urgent to clarify the behavior of individual plate and stiffened plate members under cyclic load after they have locally collapsed some of the investigations are done on girder or beam column structures cheng et al 2013 lee and noh 2010 yang n et al 2014 in the authors previous paper xia et al 2019 ultimate strengths of hull plates under uniaxial cyclic loads are studied considering fatigue crack damage although individual plates will lose their bearing capacities after their ultimate strengths have been attained while ship hull can still carrying loads as a result of the constraint from adjacent structures therefore the study on the post ultimate strength of plates under extreme cyclic loads beyond the ultimate strength is also necessary there are also a few researches in the field of both ultimate strength and post ultimate strength study under extreme cyclic loads fukumoto and kusama 1982 1983 1985a 1985b 1985c conducted theoretical and experimental investigations on the load bearing capacity of plates under in plane cyclic loading they also carried out cyclic bending tests of thin walled box beams xu et al 2012 conducted an experiment to evaluate the post ultimate strength behavior of a ship hull girder in waves accumulated plastic damage is the main influence factor they considered in ultimate strength and post ultimate strength analysis gordo and soares 2008 2009 2011 2014 performed a series of experiments of applying cyclic loading on panels and box girders yang p et al 2014 and cui h w et al 2018 found cracks on some box beam specimens under several cycles of extreme cyclic bending in post ultimate strength phase in their experiments in spite of the fact that low cycle fatigue crack damage may appear in plates under cyclic loads the effects of cracks are mostly ignored for simplification in theoretical and experimental analysis in literatures mentioned above the present paper is a further work of the authors previous paper xia et al 2019 finite element method is used to treat the combined effect of both accumulated plastic damage and fatigue crack damage on ultimate strength and post ultimate strength to simulate more practical working condition of hull plates the accumulated plastic damage is treated as the local residual stress and strain as well as the overall residual deformation the overall residual deformation is reflected by the average residual strain or residual deflection in the present paper the fatigue crack damage is reflected by crack lengths post ultimate strength stage under extreme cyclic loads is paid to particular attention the load path of average stress strain and average stress deflection is obtained 2 finite element models 2 1 geometric and material properties the adopted finite element model of the plate in present paper is the same as that of the authors previous study for the convenience of comparison xia et al 2019 the length breadth and thickness of the plate are a b t 2550 850 11 mm which is from the benchmark study of issc 2012 fatigue damage is considered as through thickness cracks in present study the initial crack and the crack propagation are artificial set for simplification as shown in fig 1 where c and w are the length and breadth of the crack respectively the crack width w is 2 mm the material of the finite element models comes from a hypothetical aframax double hull oil tanker designed by csr rules the 32ah high tensile steel with yield stress σ y 313 6 mpa young s modulus e 205 8 gpa and poisson s ratio ν 0 3 is adopted material constitutive model of the finite element model is elastic perfectly plastic material model for conservative ultimate strength assessment 2 2 boundary and loading conditions the stiffeners around the plate generally provide elastic rotational restraints on the edges of a plate they can also keep the four edges of the plate straight when it is under axial loads that constraint is between simply supported condition and clamped condition while the elastic rotational restraint varies with the rigidity of the support members simply supported boundary condition is easy to simulate and commonly adopted for conservative ultimate strength assessment the four straight edges with simply supported boundary condition are applied in finite element models midpoints of edges are fixed in relevant directions to prevent in plane movement axial loads are applied as uniform displacements on the two transverse loading edges the detail of boundary and loading conditions are shown in fig 2 2 3 initial imperfections it is a common approach to assume the lowest buckling mode as the plate initial deflection shape the average level of the magnitude of initial deflection 0 1β 2 t is adopted according to smith et al 1987 it can be seen in the study of paik 2012 and xia et al 2018 that the effect of welding induced residual stress is not so obvious than that of initial deflection therefore initial welding induced residual stress is not taken into consideration in the present paper 2 4 adopted element and mesh convergence shell181 in ansys element library ansys 2007 is adopted as the authors did in the previous paper xia et al 2019 the boundary loading conditions and meshes of the plate models are illustrated in fig 2 2 5 verification of the solving procedure the adopted solving procedure of the nonlinear finite element analysis is by newton raphson nr method the results of the solving procedure are verified on the plate model under both monotonic load and cyclic load the ultimate strength of a plate under monotonic load can be obtained by empirical formulations eq 1 faulkner 1975 or eq 2 fujikubo 2005 as follows 1 σ u σ y 2 β 1 β 2 β 1 0 2 σ u σ y 2 4 β 1 4 β 2 β 1 0 where σ u σ y is the non dimensional ultimate strength the average stress average strain curve from nonlinear finite element analysis as well as the ultimate strength value from empirical formulations eqs 1 and 2 are shown in fig 3 it is easy to see that the ultimate strength value obtained from fem is close to that of the two empirical formulas the value of eq 1 is based on test results it tends to give a relatively safe side estimate of the ultimate strength it is a lower limit value while eq 2 based on the numerical analysis of a continuous plate assuming hungry horse mode of deflection tends to give the estimate that is larger than eq 1 it gives an upper limit value of ultimate strength assessment the numerical results between the two values shown in fig 4 are reasonable in this sense the reasonability of nonlinear finite element method is verified by comparing the whole average stress average strain history paths from fem and experiments when the plate is under extreme cyclic load the experiment model and data come from scolumn6 in model tests conducted by cui and yang 2014a as shown in fig 4 four plates are welded together as a square column to simulate the real boundary condition of hull plates as well as promote the stability of experiment device the geometric and material parameters of scolumn6 are given in table 1 a finite element model with the same properties and boundary condition with scolumn6 is built and analyzed the results of fem and experiment are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the curve of fem coincides well with that of the experiment the small gap between the two curves is due to difference of the material models imperfections residual stresses boundary conditions differences etc in fem and the experiment 3 results and discussions 3 1 intact plate under extreme uniaxial cyclic compression the magnitudes of extreme longitudinal cyclic loads are adopted to reach the post ultimate strength stage where the average strain varies much more quickly than the average stress therefore the amplitude of cyclic load is controlled by displacement at the load edge of the plate here the unloading points are at the positions in the average stress average strain curves from the monotonic ultimate strength study shown in fig 3 three displacement load amplitudes corresponding to the average stress 0 94σ u 0 96σ u and 0 98σ u are adopted in this section displacement load increment in every cycle is kept the same as the load amplitude in each magnitude of cyclic loads the corresponding normalized average strains are 3 29 2 84 and 2 35 which are used to denote displacement load amplitudes in figures of this section the average strains are normalized by the yield strain average stress average strain curves in load and unload paths of cyclic compression loads are shown in fig 6 ultimate strength vs number of cycles are shown in fig 7 the ultimate strength of plates decreases after every cycle of loads in each loading condition the increment of the applied normalized strain in fig 6 is a result of the shakedown of residual stress after each cycle of cyclic loading it leads to an accumulated residual plastic deformation when the compressive load is unloaded to zero the residual plastic deformation can be seen as a new initial imperfection of the plate and the overall accumulated residual strain of the present cycle is the loading starting point of the next cycle the elastic load path of the next cycle is overlapped with the present cycle the load pattern can also be found in the experiment investigations conducted by gordo soares 2008 2014 it is also found from fig 6 that the ultimate strength of each cycle is very close to the unloading point of the previous cycle the ultimate strength of plates decreases more rapidly with a larger displacement load amplitude when the unloading points in each cycle are at a lower level value the curves of ultimate strength average residual strain under different displacement amplitudes of cyclic load are shown in fig 8 to inspect the effect of the average residual strain ε r in the process of cyclic loads it is observed that the average residual strain which reflect the overall residual deformation is accumulated as the number of cycles increase the accumulated incremental average residual strain is an important reason to lead to the reduction of the ultimate strength during cyclic loads the average residual strain increment in each cycle is almost equal when the magnitudes of cyclic loads are kept constant they are about 0 00347 0 00272 and 0 00192 for cyclic loads of 3 29 2 84 and 2 35 respectively in fig 6 the load path after the ultimate strength can be simulated as an envelope of the ultimate strength point of each cycle that envelope is very close to the load path after the ultimate strength in the one time monotonic ultimate strength study shown in fig 3 this is verified as shown in fig 9 the phenomenon can provide an idea to explore a way to simulate the load and unload paths of any cyclic loads however the out plane deflection is easier and more visual to be simulated in numerical study when compared with strain moreover the deflection is an important parameter for further study of theoretic analysis therefore the study about the relationship between the ultimate strength and deflection of plates w mm are done in figs 10 14 it is observed from figs 6 and 10 that the load path before the ultimate strength in each cycle is coincident with the unload path in the former cycle and is similar to a straight line accumulated residual deflection after each cyclic load can be regarded as the initial deflection of the next cycle therefore the accumulated residual deflection is denoted by w 0 as the initial deflection the relationship between the ultimate strength and accumulated residual deflection is illustrated in fig 11a the one time monotonic ultimate strength with various magnitudes of preset initial deflections is also analyzed for comparison there is an evident difference between the two kinds of curves ultimate strength values under cyclic loads are lower than that of the one time monotonic ultimate strengths although the accumulated residual deflections are equal to the initial deflections that difference of ultimate strength point can also be seen in fig 11b in fig 11b the curves of monotonic 0 to monotonic 4 are from the plates under monotonic loads with the corresponding residual deflections after 0 to 4 cycles in cyclic loads the level of residual stress has increased quickly with the increasing number of cycles in fig 14 this fact has confirmed that not only the overall residual deformation but also the local residual stress and strain formed in cyclic loads will lead to a reduction of the ultimate strength of plates moreover the three curves of cyclic loads in fig 11a are nearly coincident the one to one correspondence of residual deflections and ultimate strengths can be obtained in fig 12 the load path of post ultimate strength stage in cyclic loads is compared with the unload path after the ultimate strength in the one time monotonic ultimate strength study as fig 11 the two kinds of curves coincide with each other well then the load and unload paths of cyclic loads can be simulated based on the ultimate strength deflection curve shown in fig 13 the points marked by number 0 2 4 6 8 stand for the residual deflections after cyclic loads points 1 3 5 7 are the ultimate strength points corresponded to relevant initial deflections the load path and unload path can be drawn similar to 0 1 1 2 2 1 1 3 3 4 4 3 3 5 5 6 6 5 5 7 7 8 as long as the residual deflections are measured 3 2 intact plate under extreme uniaxial cyclic tension and compression the plate is applied uniaxial bidirectional load in each cycle of cyclic loads in this section the compression load is applied firstly to reach the post ultimate strength stage of the plate then the compression is unloaded to zero after that tension load is applied to the plate and then unloaded to zero that is a whole cycle of the cyclic load the displacement amplitudes under compressive load are 3 29 2 84 and 2 35 the same as those in section 3 1 3 2 1 determination of the tensile load amplitude the strength behaviors of steel plates under tension are very different with that under compression without the buckling behavior in compression the tensile ultimate strength of the plate is usually much larger than the compressive ultimate strength therefore main attention is paid to compressive ultimate strength in this section three tensile load amplitudes are investigated with the same displacement amplitude under compressive load as 3 29 1 the first tensile load amplitude is set as an equal reverse displacement load to the compressive displacement load amplitude when the compressive displacement load is unloaded to zero 2 the second tensile load amplitude is also set as an equal reverse displacement load to the compressive displacement load amplitude but the reverse displacement load start just when the compressive load not the compressive displacement load is unloaded to zero 3 the last tensile load amplitude is a displacement value which makes the tensile load equal to the monotonic compressive ultimate strength the average stress vs strain and stress vs deflection curves of three tensile load amplitudes are shown in figs 15 18 the processes of the cyclic loads include the whole path of the first cycle and the compressive ultimate strength of the second cycle the non dimensional compressive ultimate strengths in the first and second cycle are compared in table 2 the unloading point stress and tensile stress amplitudes are also recorded it can be seen in fig 15 that the tensile ultimate limit state has been reached in the first tensile load amplitude of cyclic load the non dimensional tensile ultimate strength is very close to 1 it means the tensile ultimate strength of the hull thin plate adopted in present paper is nearly equal to the yield stress of the steel material due to the inexistence of buckling behavior in tension it is easy to see in figs 15 and 16 and table 2 that the compressive and tensile stress amplitudes are not symmetrical and the compressive ultimate strength of the 2nd cycle can be larger than the unloading point stress or even the compressive ultimate strength of the 1st cycle as long as the tensile load amplitudes are large enough that may be because of the residual tensile plastic deformation and stress in the first cycle while in the third tensile load amplitude in fig 17 and table 2 the point of compressive ultimate strength of the 2nd cycle is almost the same as the unloading point that accords with the regulation found in 3 1 therefore the third tensile load amplitude is adopted in present study 3 2 2 load paths of extreme cyclic loads it is observed in subsection 3 2 1 that the tensile ultimate strength is nearly equal to the yield stress which is much larger than the compressive ultimate strength this means the plate is easier to collapse in compression under the same cyclic load amplitude the tensile load amplitude adopted in present study has not reached the tensile ultimate strength of the plate therefore only compressive ultimate strength is considered in present paper the load paths of extreme cyclic loads with three compressive displacement load amplitudes adopted in section 3 1 are shown in figs 18 20 it is easy to see that compressive ultimate strengths decrease as the number of cycle increases similar to the conclusion in section 3 1 the compressive ultimate strength decreases more obviously with a larger compressive displacement load amplitude the non dimensional compressive ultimate strengths of each cycle under different compressive displacement load amplitudes are shown in table 3 moreover the compressive ultimate strength in each cycle is still close to the unloading point of the previous cycle that is to say that the compressive ultimate strength behavior of each cycle can be regarded as a part of the compressive post ultimate strength behavior of the previous cycle in extreme cyclic loads in order to discover the effect of tensile loads in cyclic loads the non dimensional compressive ultimate strengths of each cycle under compressive cyclic load in section 3 1 and bidirectional cyclic load in this section with the same compressive displacement load amplitude are compared in table 4 it can be seen that the compressive ultimate strength of bidirectional cyclic load decreases slower than that of the compressive cyclic load it is realized that the tensile loads in cyclic loads can reduce the compressive accumulated plastic residual stress and strain in plates the average residual strain and residual deflection of each cycle is an important reason to lead to the reduction of the ultimate strength it is shown in table 5 that the average compressive accumulated plastic residual strain of the bidirectional cyclic load is lower than that of the compressive cyclic load the most evident difference between the load curves of the bidirectional cyclic load and compressive cyclic load is the hysteresis loops in figs 18 20 which do not exist in the load path of the compressive cyclic load the cyclic hysteretic curves are formed by the load path and unload path of compression and tension the area of the hysteresis loop is called the reverse plastic energy which leads to the ratcheting behavior of the plate the load curve of monotonic compression and the envelope of tensile amplitude are also drawn in figs 18 20 it can be seen that the unload path of compression in bidirectional cyclic load coincides well with the load curve of monotonic compression the load curves in figs 18 20 are all between that two curves therefore the load curve of monotonic compression and the envelope of tensile amplitude can be regarded as the envelope curves of the whole load path 3 3 extreme uniaxial cyclic tension and compression with cracks in this section a proper initial crack length 45 mm is preset in the plate model so that the element strain at the crack tip can reach the critical value of crack propagation in the first few cycles of cyclic load that will make it more convenient to observe the crack propagation under extreme cyclic load the initial crack length is determined from a series of trial calculation of the element strain at the crack tip the location of the preset crack is the mid span of the longitudinal plate edge where it has the maximal strain and greatest possibility of crack initiation the same dead live element method and element strain threshold value are adopted to simulate the crack propagation in present study as the authors did in the previous paper xia et al 2019 the direction of crack propagation is controlled by the mesh of crack path which is perpendicular to longitudinal plate edge both tensile and compressive loads are included in the longitudinal cyclic load to obtain the crack propagation and compressive ultimate strength the crack propagation process can be divided into 4 steps as followed step 1 tensile strains of elements at the crack tip reach the threshold values those elements will be killed and become dead step 2 a very small factor estif 1 0e 6 is made to multiply the stiffness matrix of a element when the element is killed the element load of dead element will become 0 it will not be effective to loading vector step 3 new crack tip elements are born the crack length is increased along the crack propagation path step 4 go back to step 1 the crack propagation is accomplished with the increasing number of dead elements three new compressive displacement load amplitudes 5 512 mm 5 400 mm and 5 280 mm are applied on the cracked plate models they are also transformed to non dimensional average strain 2 84 2 78 and 2 72 for a convenience to be observed in the load paths of average stress average strain curves just as the load amplitudes in section 3 1 and 3 2 the three compressive load amplitudes have also reached the post ultimate strength stage and the symmetrical tensile loads adopted are still used in this section the tensile load amplitude is the displacement values which make the tensile loads equal to the monotonic compressive ultimate strengths of the cracked plates the load paths of the cracked plate models under load amplitudes 2 84 2 78 and 2 72 are firstly obtained in fig 21 without considering crack propagation different from the load paths of intact plates the compressive ultimate limit state points in each cycle in fig 21 are no longer close to the unloading points of the previous cycle nevertheless the compressive ultimate strength values in each cycle are still approximately equal to unloading point loads of the previous cycle when crack propagation is considered in the nonlinear finite element analysis the partial enlarged view of stress contour near the crack in fig 22 is adopted to observe the detail process of crack length variation the crack propagation process of cracked plate under the three load amplitudes after first three cycles is illustrated in figs 23 25 it can be observed that the crack propagates faster when the load amplitude become larger compared with the results in the authors previous paper the crack in present study can begin to propagate from a shorter initial length and in a much larger propagation rate that signifies the fact that much greater level of local accumulated residual stress and strain at the crack tip are formed during the extreme cyclic load when the load amplitude reaches the post ultimate strength stage of the plate the typical overall deformation and equivalent stress distribution of the cracked plates at uls ultimate limit state under uniaxial cyclic tension and compression with load amplitude 2 78 are shown in fig 26 it can be seen that the region of yield stress and high level stress decreases with the increasing number of cycles that infers a reduction of the ultimate strength the yield regions are all around the crack due to stress concentration the deflection of the plate increases as the number of cycles increases that increment is caused by the no negligible accumulated plastic deformation during the extreme cyclic load waveforms at uls are no more the same as the lowest buckling mode although the number of waves is still 3 in the longitudinal direction the amplitudes of the middle wave are much larger than that of the sideway waves that is because the deformation and strain at the mid span of the plate are larger than that of sideway regions and the extreme load in every cycle which can reach the compressive post ultimate strength stage makes the difference of deformation more evident fig 27 shows the average stress average strain load paths of the cracked plate models under load amplitudes 2 84 2 78 and 2 72 when the crack propagation is taken into consideration it is easy to see the difference between the load paths in figs 21 and 27 compressive ultimate strength values in each cycle have become lower than unloading point loads of the previous cycle with the increment of the crack length crack lengths and non dimensional ultimate strength values σ u σ y considering crack propagation after each cycle with different load amplitudes are obtained in table 6 the reduction and the proportion of the ultimate strength compared with the initial ultimate strength values after 0 cycles are also recorded combined effect of accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage arisen from the extreme cyclic load lead to that reduction non dimensional ultimate strength values without considering crack propagation after each cycle are shown in table 7 to obtain the individual effect of accumulated plastic damage on the compressive ultimate strength of the plate tables 8 10 have recorded the non dimensional ultimate strength values of plates with the same crack length in each cycle in table 6 under one time monotonic loads the data in tables 8 10 can reflect the individual effect of fatigue crack damage on the compressive ultimate strength of the plate the linear superposition of individual reduction and multiplication of individual proportion in table 7 and tables 8 10 are used to predict the ultimate strength considering the combined effect of accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage the assumed predicted values from the two methods are denoted as assumption1 and assumption2 they are compared with the actual values in table 6 tables 11 13 have showed the comparison of the actual ultimate strength values and assumed predicted values with different load amplitudes the values of assumption1 and assumption2 can be expressed as 3 a s s u m p t i o n 1 u 0 r 1 r 2 u 0 u 0 u 1 u 0 u 2 u 1 u 2 u 0 4 a s s u m p t i o n 2 u 0 p 1 p 2 u 0 u 1 u 0 u 2 u 0 u 1 u 2 u 0 where the initial ultimate strength values after 0 cycles is denoted as u 0 r 1 p 1 and u 1 are the individual reduction proportion and ultimate strength only considering accumulated plastic damage r 2 p 2 and u 2 are the individual reduction proportion and ultimate strength only considering low cycle fatigue crack damage the actual ultimate strength values are between assumption1 and assumption2 and approximate with the values assumption2 that means the combined effect of accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage on the ultimate strength of plate is more likely to be a coupling of the two individual ones rather than a simple linear superposition the ultimate strength of cracked plates under extreme longitudinal cyclic loads considering crack propagation can be approximately predicted by eq 4 the mechanism of ultimate strength reduction effect of hull plates under extreme longitudinal cyclic loads can be illustrated in fig 28 4 conclusions in present paper nonlinear fe method is used to deal with the strength behaviors of a typical hull plate model under extreme longitudinal cyclic load different levels and patterns of displacement loads are applied on the plate edges to reach both the ultimate strength and post ultimate strength stages various factors which affect the compressive ultimate strength value are analyzed load paths of different working conditions are obtained a few meaningful conclusions have been drawn for this particular model as follows 1 the ultimate strength of the intact plate in each cycle is very close to the unloading point of the previous cycle the compressive ultimate strength behavior of each cycle can be regarded as a reduction of the compressive post ultimate strength behavior of the previous cycle in extreme cyclic loads 2 a simplified way to simulate the load path and unload path of any cyclic compression is introduced based on the one time monotonic ultimate strength study 3 not only overall residual deformation but also local residual stress and strain formed in each cycle are important reasons to lead to the reduction of the ultimate strength tensile loads in cyclic loads will reduce the compressive accumulated plastic damage in plates that will lead to a slower decrement in compressive ultimate strength of bidirectional cyclic load than that of the compressive cyclic load 4 the average stress average strain load paths of the cracked plate models under different load amplitudes are obtained with and without considering crack propagation compressive ultimate strength values in each cycle are lower than unloading point loads of the previous cycle while the crack propagates the combined effect of accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage on the ultimate strength of plate is more likely to be a coupling of the two individual ones rather than a simple linear superposition the mechanism of ultimate strength reduction effect of hull plates under extreme longitudinal cyclic loads is summarized as shown in fig 28 acknowledgement the authors of the present

22356,the present paper aims at making a research on the ultimate strength and post ultimate strength behaviors of hull plates under extreme longitudinal cyclic load the cyclic load is controlled by displacement at the load edge of the plate to reach both ultimate strength and post ultimate strength stages two load patterns are considered for cyclic compressive and cyclic tensile compressive load the ultimate strength of intact plates in each cycle are found to be close to the unloading points of the previous cycle it is found that not only the overall residual deformation but also the local residual stress and strain formed in cyclic loads will lead to a reduction of the ultimate strength of plates accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage arisen from the extreme cyclic load are discussed in present study the combined effect of accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage on the ultimate strength and post ultimate strength as well as the load path of hull plates is obtained it can be seen as a coupling effect of the two individual ones the mechanical mechanism of strength behaviors in each condition of cyclic loading is analyzed keywords ultimate strength post ultimate strength cyclic load accumulated plastic damage low cycle fatigue damage nonlinear finite element analysis 1 introduction nowadays the traditional allowable working stress criteria is inadequate in ship hull and offshore structure design in order to know the true margin of structure safety development of structural design and strength assessment based on the ultimate strength is very fast and has been listed in some basic standards and rules iacs 2006a b imo 2006 iso 2006 2007 issc 2000 2012 ship hull plates are the basic structural components of hull girders the individual stress strain relationship and ultimate strength of plates is necessary for the progressive collapse analysis of the whole hull girder design it is well recognized that the main external load the hull girder bears in its life time service is wave load hull plates are mainly under repeated axial cyclic loads when bending moments duo to wave load are applied on hull girders accumulated plastic damage during cyclic loads may affect the ultimate strength value of plates therefore research on hull plates under cyclic loads is of great practical significance literatures about steel structures under cyclic load are limited yao and nikolov 1990 proposed that it is also important to know the residual strength of a hull under cyclic loading due to waves after its ultimate strength has been attained under the extreme sea condition it is urgent to clarify the behavior of individual plate and stiffened plate members under cyclic load after they have locally collapsed some of the investigations are done on girder or beam column structures cheng et al 2013 lee and noh 2010 yang n et al 2014 in the authors previous paper xia et al 2019 ultimate strengths of hull plates under uniaxial cyclic loads are studied considering fatigue crack damage although individual plates will lose their bearing capacities after their ultimate strengths have been attained while ship hull can still carrying loads as a result of the constraint from adjacent structures therefore the study on the post ultimate strength of plates under extreme cyclic loads beyond the ultimate strength is also necessary there are also a few researches in the field of both ultimate strength and post ultimate strength study under extreme cyclic loads fukumoto and kusama 1982 1983 1985a 1985b 1985c conducted theoretical and experimental investigations on the load bearing capacity of plates under in plane cyclic loading they also carried out cyclic bending tests of thin walled box beams xu et al 2012 conducted an experiment to evaluate the post ultimate strength behavior of a ship hull girder in waves accumulated plastic damage is the main influence factor they considered in ultimate strength and post ultimate strength analysis gordo and soares 2008 2009 2011 2014 performed a series of experiments of applying cyclic loading on panels and box girders yang p et al 2014 and cui h w et al 2018 found cracks on some box beam specimens under several cycles of extreme cyclic bending in post ultimate strength phase in their experiments in spite of the fact that low cycle fatigue crack damage may appear in plates under cyclic loads the effects of cracks are mostly ignored for simplification in theoretical and experimental analysis in literatures mentioned above the present paper is a further work of the authors previous paper xia et al 2019 finite element method is used to treat the combined effect of both accumulated plastic damage and fatigue crack damage on ultimate strength and post ultimate strength to simulate more practical working condition of hull plates the accumulated plastic damage is treated as the local residual stress and strain as well as the overall residual deformation the overall residual deformation is reflected by the average residual strain or residual deflection in the present paper the fatigue crack damage is reflected by crack lengths post ultimate strength stage under extreme cyclic loads is paid to particular attention the load path of average stress strain and average stress deflection is obtained 2 finite element models 2 1 geometric and material properties the adopted finite element model of the plate in present paper is the same as that of the authors previous study for the convenience of comparison xia et al 2019 the length breadth and thickness of the plate are a b t 2550 850 11 mm which is from the benchmark study of issc 2012 fatigue damage is considered as through thickness cracks in present study the initial crack and the crack propagation are artificial set for simplification as shown in fig 1 where c and w are the length and breadth of the crack respectively the crack width w is 2 mm the material of the finite element models comes from a hypothetical aframax double hull oil tanker designed by csr rules the 32ah high tensile steel with yield stress σ y 313 6 mpa young s modulus e 205 8 gpa and poisson s ratio ν 0 3 is adopted material constitutive model of the finite element model is elastic perfectly plastic material model for conservative ultimate strength assessment 2 2 boundary and loading conditions the stiffeners around the plate generally provide elastic rotational restraints on the edges of a plate they can also keep the four edges of the plate straight when it is under axial loads that constraint is between simply supported condition and clamped condition while the elastic rotational restraint varies with the rigidity of the support members simply supported boundary condition is easy to simulate and commonly adopted for conservative ultimate strength assessment the four straight edges with simply supported boundary condition are applied in finite element models midpoints of edges are fixed in relevant directions to prevent in plane movement axial loads are applied as uniform displacements on the two transverse loading edges the detail of boundary and loading conditions are shown in fig 2 2 3 initial imperfections it is a common approach to assume the lowest buckling mode as the plate initial deflection shape the average level of the magnitude of initial deflection 0 1β 2 t is adopted according to smith et al 1987 it can be seen in the study of paik 2012 and xia et al 2018 that the effect of welding induced residual stress is not so obvious than that of initial deflection therefore initial welding induced residual stress is not taken into consideration in the present paper 2 4 adopted element and mesh convergence shell181 in ansys element library ansys 2007 is adopted as the authors did in the previous paper xia et al 2019 the boundary loading conditions and meshes of the plate models are illustrated in fig 2 2 5 verification of the solving procedure the adopted solving procedure of the nonlinear finite element analysis is by newton raphson nr method the results of the solving procedure are verified on the plate model under both monotonic load and cyclic load the ultimate strength of a plate under monotonic load can be obtained by empirical formulations eq 1 faulkner 1975 or eq 2 fujikubo 2005 as follows 1 σ u σ y 2 β 1 β 2 β 1 0 2 σ u σ y 2 4 β 1 4 β 2 β 1 0 where σ u σ y is the non dimensional ultimate strength the average stress average strain curve from nonlinear finite element analysis as well as the ultimate strength value from empirical formulations eqs 1 and 2 are shown in fig 3 it is easy to see that the ultimate strength value obtained from fem is close to that of the two empirical formulas the value of eq 1 is based on test results it tends to give a relatively safe side estimate of the ultimate strength it is a lower limit value while eq 2 based on the numerical analysis of a continuous plate assuming hungry horse mode of deflection tends to give the estimate that is larger than eq 1 it gives an upper limit value of ultimate strength assessment the numerical results between the two values shown in fig 4 are reasonable in this sense the reasonability of nonlinear finite element method is verified by comparing the whole average stress average strain history paths from fem and experiments when the plate is under extreme cyclic load the experiment model and data come from scolumn6 in model tests conducted by cui and yang 2014a as shown in fig 4 four plates are welded together as a square column to simulate the real boundary condition of hull plates as well as promote the stability of experiment device the geometric and material parameters of scolumn6 are given in table 1 a finite element model with the same properties and boundary condition with scolumn6 is built and analyzed the results of fem and experiment are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that the curve of fem coincides well with that of the experiment the small gap between the two curves is due to difference of the material models imperfections residual stresses boundary conditions differences etc in fem and the experiment 3 results and discussions 3 1 intact plate under extreme uniaxial cyclic compression the magnitudes of extreme longitudinal cyclic loads are adopted to reach the post ultimate strength stage where the average strain varies much more quickly than the average stress therefore the amplitude of cyclic load is controlled by displacement at the load edge of the plate here the unloading points are at the positions in the average stress average strain curves from the monotonic ultimate strength study shown in fig 3 three displacement load amplitudes corresponding to the average stress 0 94σ u 0 96σ u and 0 98σ u are adopted in this section displacement load increment in every cycle is kept the same as the load amplitude in each magnitude of cyclic loads the corresponding normalized average strains are 3 29 2 84 and 2 35 which are used to denote displacement load amplitudes in figures of this section the average strains are normalized by the yield strain average stress average strain curves in load and unload paths of cyclic compression loads are shown in fig 6 ultimate strength vs number of cycles are shown in fig 7 the ultimate strength of plates decreases after every cycle of loads in each loading condition the increment of the applied normalized strain in fig 6 is a result of the shakedown of residual stress after each cycle of cyclic loading it leads to an accumulated residual plastic deformation when the compressive load is unloaded to zero the residual plastic deformation can be seen as a new initial imperfection of the plate and the overall accumulated residual strain of the present cycle is the loading starting point of the next cycle the elastic load path of the next cycle is overlapped with the present cycle the load pattern can also be found in the experiment investigations conducted by gordo soares 2008 2014 it is also found from fig 6 that the ultimate strength of each cycle is very close to the unloading point of the previous cycle the ultimate strength of plates decreases more rapidly with a larger displacement load amplitude when the unloading points in each cycle are at a lower level value the curves of ultimate strength average residual strain under different displacement amplitudes of cyclic load are shown in fig 8 to inspect the effect of the average residual strain ε r in the process of cyclic loads it is observed that the average residual strain which reflect the overall residual deformation is accumulated as the number of cycles increase the accumulated incremental average residual strain is an important reason to lead to the reduction of the ultimate strength during cyclic loads the average residual strain increment in each cycle is almost equal when the magnitudes of cyclic loads are kept constant they are about 0 00347 0 00272 and 0 00192 for cyclic loads of 3 29 2 84 and 2 35 respectively in fig 6 the load path after the ultimate strength can be simulated as an envelope of the ultimate strength point of each cycle that envelope is very close to the load path after the ultimate strength in the one time monotonic ultimate strength study shown in fig 3 this is verified as shown in fig 9 the phenomenon can provide an idea to explore a way to simulate the load and unload paths of any cyclic loads however the out plane deflection is easier and more visual to be simulated in numerical study when compared with strain moreover the deflection is an important parameter for further study of theoretic analysis therefore the study about the relationship between the ultimate strength and deflection of plates w mm are done in figs 10 14 it is observed from figs 6 and 10 that the load path before the ultimate strength in each cycle is coincident with the unload path in the former cycle and is similar to a straight line accumulated residual deflection after each cyclic load can be regarded as the initial deflection of the next cycle therefore the accumulated residual deflection is denoted by w 0 as the initial deflection the relationship between the ultimate strength and accumulated residual deflection is illustrated in fig 11a the one time monotonic ultimate strength with various magnitudes of preset initial deflections is also analyzed for comparison there is an evident difference between the two kinds of curves ultimate strength values under cyclic loads are lower than that of the one time monotonic ultimate strengths although the accumulated residual deflections are equal to the initial deflections that difference of ultimate strength point can also be seen in fig 11b in fig 11b the curves of monotonic 0 to monotonic 4 are from the plates under monotonic loads with the corresponding residual deflections after 0 to 4 cycles in cyclic loads the level of residual stress has increased quickly with the increasing number of cycles in fig 14 this fact has confirmed that not only the overall residual deformation but also the local residual stress and strain formed in cyclic loads will lead to a reduction of the ultimate strength of plates moreover the three curves of cyclic loads in fig 11a are nearly coincident the one to one correspondence of residual deflections and ultimate strengths can be obtained in fig 12 the load path of post ultimate strength stage in cyclic loads is compared with the unload path after the ultimate strength in the one time monotonic ultimate strength study as fig 11 the two kinds of curves coincide with each other well then the load and unload paths of cyclic loads can be simulated based on the ultimate strength deflection curve shown in fig 13 the points marked by number 0 2 4 6 8 stand for the residual deflections after cyclic loads points 1 3 5 7 are the ultimate strength points corresponded to relevant initial deflections the load path and unload path can be drawn similar to 0 1 1 2 2 1 1 3 3 4 4 3 3 5 5 6 6 5 5 7 7 8 as long as the residual deflections are measured 3 2 intact plate under extreme uniaxial cyclic tension and compression the plate is applied uniaxial bidirectional load in each cycle of cyclic loads in this section the compression load is applied firstly to reach the post ultimate strength stage of the plate then the compression is unloaded to zero after that tension load is applied to the plate and then unloaded to zero that is a whole cycle of the cyclic load the displacement amplitudes under compressive load are 3 29 2 84 and 2 35 the same as those in section 3 1 3 2 1 determination of the tensile load amplitude the strength behaviors of steel plates under tension are very different with that under compression without the buckling behavior in compression the tensile ultimate strength of the plate is usually much larger than the compressive ultimate strength therefore main attention is paid to compressive ultimate strength in this section three tensile load amplitudes are investigated with the same displacement amplitude under compressive load as 3 29 1 the first tensile load amplitude is set as an equal reverse displacement load to the compressive displacement load amplitude when the compressive displacement load is unloaded to zero 2 the second tensile load amplitude is also set as an equal reverse displacement load to the compressive displacement load amplitude but the reverse displacement load start just when the compressive load not the compressive displacement load is unloaded to zero 3 the last tensile load amplitude is a displacement value which makes the tensile load equal to the monotonic compressive ultimate strength the average stress vs strain and stress vs deflection curves of three tensile load amplitudes are shown in figs 15 18 the processes of the cyclic loads include the whole path of the first cycle and the compressive ultimate strength of the second cycle the non dimensional compressive ultimate strengths in the first and second cycle are compared in table 2 the unloading point stress and tensile stress amplitudes are also recorded it can be seen in fig 15 that the tensile ultimate limit state has been reached in the first tensile load amplitude of cyclic load the non dimensional tensile ultimate strength is very close to 1 it means the tensile ultimate strength of the hull thin plate adopted in present paper is nearly equal to the yield stress of the steel material due to the inexistence of buckling behavior in tension it is easy to see in figs 15 and 16 and table 2 that the compressive and tensile stress amplitudes are not symmetrical and the compressive ultimate strength of the 2nd cycle can be larger than the unloading point stress or even the compressive ultimate strength of the 1st cycle as long as the tensile load amplitudes are large enough that may be because of the residual tensile plastic deformation and stress in the first cycle while in the third tensile load amplitude in fig 17 and table 2 the point of compressive ultimate strength of the 2nd cycle is almost the same as the unloading point that accords with the regulation found in 3 1 therefore the third tensile load amplitude is adopted in present study 3 2 2 load paths of extreme cyclic loads it is observed in subsection 3 2 1 that the tensile ultimate strength is nearly equal to the yield stress which is much larger than the compressive ultimate strength this means the plate is easier to collapse in compression under the same cyclic load amplitude the tensile load amplitude adopted in present study has not reached the tensile ultimate strength of the plate therefore only compressive ultimate strength is considered in present paper the load paths of extreme cyclic loads with three compressive displacement load amplitudes adopted in section 3 1 are shown in figs 18 20 it is easy to see that compressive ultimate strengths decrease as the number of cycle increases similar to the conclusion in section 3 1 the compressive ultimate strength decreases more obviously with a larger compressive displacement load amplitude the non dimensional compressive ultimate strengths of each cycle under different compressive displacement load amplitudes are shown in table 3 moreover the compressive ultimate strength in each cycle is still close to the unloading point of the previous cycle that is to say that the compressive ultimate strength behavior of each cycle can be regarded as a part of the compressive post ultimate strength behavior of the previous cycle in extreme cyclic loads in order to discover the effect of tensile loads in cyclic loads the non dimensional compressive ultimate strengths of each cycle under compressive cyclic load in section 3 1 and bidirectional cyclic load in this section with the same compressive displacement load amplitude are compared in table 4 it can be seen that the compressive ultimate strength of bidirectional cyclic load decreases slower than that of the compressive cyclic load it is realized that the tensile loads in cyclic loads can reduce the compressive accumulated plastic residual stress and strain in plates the average residual strain and residual deflection of each cycle is an important reason to lead to the reduction of the ultimate strength it is shown in table 5 that the average compressive accumulated plastic residual strain of the bidirectional cyclic load is lower than that of the compressive cyclic load the most evident difference between the load curves of the bidirectional cyclic load and compressive cyclic load is the hysteresis loops in figs 18 20 which do not exist in the load path of the compressive cyclic load the cyclic hysteretic curves are formed by the load path and unload path of compression and tension the area of the hysteresis loop is called the reverse plastic energy which leads to the ratcheting behavior of the plate the load curve of monotonic compression and the envelope of tensile amplitude are also drawn in figs 18 20 it can be seen that the unload path of compression in bidirectional cyclic load coincides well with the load curve of monotonic compression the load curves in figs 18 20 are all between that two curves therefore the load curve of monotonic compression and the envelope of tensile amplitude can be regarded as the envelope curves of the whole load path 3 3 extreme uniaxial cyclic tension and compression with cracks in this section a proper initial crack length 45 mm is preset in the plate model so that the element strain at the crack tip can reach the critical value of crack propagation in the first few cycles of cyclic load that will make it more convenient to observe the crack propagation under extreme cyclic load the initial crack length is determined from a series of trial calculation of the element strain at the crack tip the location of the preset crack is the mid span of the longitudinal plate edge where it has the maximal strain and greatest possibility of crack initiation the same dead live element method and element strain threshold value are adopted to simulate the crack propagation in present study as the authors did in the previous paper xia et al 2019 the direction of crack propagation is controlled by the mesh of crack path which is perpendicular to longitudinal plate edge both tensile and compressive loads are included in the longitudinal cyclic load to obtain the crack propagation and compressive ultimate strength the crack propagation process can be divided into 4 steps as followed step 1 tensile strains of elements at the crack tip reach the threshold values those elements will be killed and become dead step 2 a very small factor estif 1 0e 6 is made to multiply the stiffness matrix of a element when the element is killed the element load of dead element will become 0 it will not be effective to loading vector step 3 new crack tip elements are born the crack length is increased along the crack propagation path step 4 go back to step 1 the crack propagation is accomplished with the increasing number of dead elements three new compressive displacement load amplitudes 5 512 mm 5 400 mm and 5 280 mm are applied on the cracked plate models they are also transformed to non dimensional average strain 2 84 2 78 and 2 72 for a convenience to be observed in the load paths of average stress average strain curves just as the load amplitudes in section 3 1 and 3 2 the three compressive load amplitudes have also reached the post ultimate strength stage and the symmetrical tensile loads adopted are still used in this section the tensile load amplitude is the displacement values which make the tensile loads equal to the monotonic compressive ultimate strengths of the cracked plates the load paths of the cracked plate models under load amplitudes 2 84 2 78 and 2 72 are firstly obtained in fig 21 without considering crack propagation different from the load paths of intact plates the compressive ultimate limit state points in each cycle in fig 21 are no longer close to the unloading points of the previous cycle nevertheless the compressive ultimate strength values in each cycle are still approximately equal to unloading point loads of the previous cycle when crack propagation is considered in the nonlinear finite element analysis the partial enlarged view of stress contour near the crack in fig 22 is adopted to observe the detail process of crack length variation the crack propagation process of cracked plate under the three load amplitudes after first three cycles is illustrated in figs 23 25 it can be observed that the crack propagates faster when the load amplitude become larger compared with the results in the authors previous paper the crack in present study can begin to propagate from a shorter initial length and in a much larger propagation rate that signifies the fact that much greater level of local accumulated residual stress and strain at the crack tip are formed during the extreme cyclic load when the load amplitude reaches the post ultimate strength stage of the plate the typical overall deformation and equivalent stress distribution of the cracked plates at uls ultimate limit state under uniaxial cyclic tension and compression with load amplitude 2 78 are shown in fig 26 it can be seen that the region of yield stress and high level stress decreases with the increasing number of cycles that infers a reduction of the ultimate strength the yield regions are all around the crack due to stress concentration the deflection of the plate increases as the number of cycles increases that increment is caused by the no negligible accumulated plastic deformation during the extreme cyclic load waveforms at uls are no more the same as the lowest buckling mode although the number of waves is still 3 in the longitudinal direction the amplitudes of the middle wave are much larger than that of the sideway waves that is because the deformation and strain at the mid span of the plate are larger than that of sideway regions and the extreme load in every cycle which can reach the compressive post ultimate strength stage makes the difference of deformation more evident fig 27 shows the average stress average strain load paths of the cracked plate models under load amplitudes 2 84 2 78 and 2 72 when the crack propagation is taken into consideration it is easy to see the difference between the load paths in figs 21 and 27 compressive ultimate strength values in each cycle have become lower than unloading point loads of the previous cycle with the increment of the crack length crack lengths and non dimensional ultimate strength values σ u σ y considering crack propagation after each cycle with different load amplitudes are obtained in table 6 the reduction and the proportion of the ultimate strength compared with the initial ultimate strength values after 0 cycles are also recorded combined effect of accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage arisen from the extreme cyclic load lead to that reduction non dimensional ultimate strength values without considering crack propagation after each cycle are shown in table 7 to obtain the individual effect of accumulated plastic damage on the compressive ultimate strength of the plate tables 8 10 have recorded the non dimensional ultimate strength values of plates with the same crack length in each cycle in table 6 under one time monotonic loads the data in tables 8 10 can reflect the individual effect of fatigue crack damage on the compressive ultimate strength of the plate the linear superposition of individual reduction and multiplication of individual proportion in table 7 and tables 8 10 are used to predict the ultimate strength considering the combined effect of accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage the assumed predicted values from the two methods are denoted as assumption1 and assumption2 they are compared with the actual values in table 6 tables 11 13 have showed the comparison of the actual ultimate strength values and assumed predicted values with different load amplitudes the values of assumption1 and assumption2 can be expressed as 3 a s s u m p t i o n 1 u 0 r 1 r 2 u 0 u 0 u 1 u 0 u 2 u 1 u 2 u 0 4 a s s u m p t i o n 2 u 0 p 1 p 2 u 0 u 1 u 0 u 2 u 0 u 1 u 2 u 0 where the initial ultimate strength values after 0 cycles is denoted as u 0 r 1 p 1 and u 1 are the individual reduction proportion and ultimate strength only considering accumulated plastic damage r 2 p 2 and u 2 are the individual reduction proportion and ultimate strength only considering low cycle fatigue crack damage the actual ultimate strength values are between assumption1 and assumption2 and approximate with the values assumption2 that means the combined effect of accumulated plastic damage and low cycle fatigue crack damage on the ultimate strength of plate is more likely to be a coupling of the two individual ones rather than a simple linear superposition the ultimate strength of cracked plates under extreme longitudinal cyclic loads considering crack propagation can be approximately predicted by eq 4 the mechanism of ultimate strength reduction effect of hull plates under extreme longitudinal cyclic loads can be illustrated in fig 28 4 conclusions in present paper nonlinear fe method is used to deal with the strength behaviors of a typical hull plate model under extreme longitudinal cyclic load different levels and patterns of displacement loads are applied on the plate edges to reach both the ultimate strength and post ultimate strength stages various factors which affect the compressive ultimate strength value are analyzed load paths of different working conditions are obtained a few meaningful conclusions have been drawn for this particular model as follows 1

reduction of the compressive post ultimate strength behavior of the previous cycle in extreme cyclic loads 2 a simplified way to simulate the load path and unload path of any cyclic compression is introduced based on the one time monotonic ultimate strength study 3 not only overall residual deformation but also local residual stress and strain formed in each cycle are important reasons to lead to the reduction of the ultimate strength tensile loads in cyclic loads will reduce the compressive accumulated plastic damage in plates that will lead to a slower decrement in compressive ultimate strength of bidirectional cyclic load than that of the compressive cyclic load 4 the average stress average strain load paths of the cracked plate models under different load amplitudes are obtained

22357,this paper figures out investigations into the ultimate strength of ultra large container ships ulcs both the experiment and non linear finite element method nfem are utilized to evaluate the ultimate longitudinal strength behaviors of hull girder for ulcs in this study firstly an experiment regarding the similar model is carried out to examine the characteristics of the ultimate longitudinal strength of the ultra large container ship s hull girder structures the test model is designed by similar theory to reflect the progressive collapse behaviors of actual hull girder under hogging bending moment secondly the results of simulations performed by numerical analysis into hull girder ultimate strength are compared with the experimental results the results show good agreement with model test demonstrating the reliability of nfem finally a series of non linear finite element analysis is performed to assess the ultimate strength of hull girder taking into account the effects of initial imperfections and both material and geometric nonlinearities in which the typical 4 000 teu 10 000 teu and 20 000 teu representing normal and ultra large container ships are adopted as study cases to clarify the ultimate strength characteristics of ulcs this analysis can help to cognize the ultimate longitudinal strength of ulcs keywords ultimate strength ulcs progressive collapse behaviors similar model experimental investigations nfem 1 introduction knowing the maximum load carrying capacity of actual hull girder is very important in the structural ultimate limit state design for ships and offshore structures of which the ultimate longitudinal strength is especially important usually referring to as the maximum hull girder ultimate strength there are big advantages in the process of transporting goods for container ships such as high loading unloading efficiency and small wastage therefore container ships become larger and larger with the recent increasing economy however ultra large container ships will encounter more problems regarding strength due to big scale and high speed actually whipping is very important for the verification of the ultimate bending moment capacity of the hull girder because whipping response may significantly increase the wave frequency vertical wave bending moment meanwhile for ulcs whipping loads are extremely sensitive to the ship speed and the effect on wave induced loads will be further amplified under high ship speed jasna et al 2014 there have been many news about hull girder rupture for ultra large container ships at present ultimate longitudinal strength assessment of a typical ultra large container ship is taken into account in this paper through experimental and numerical analysis the torsional ultimate strength is not considered although it is important for ulcs due to large deck opening but for the present study purpose it focuses on the main ultimate strength relatively for ship structures i e the ultimate longitudinal strength there have been many research works conducted on the ultimate strength behaviors of hull girder including local members such as plates stiffened panels and box girders the formulas assessing the ultimate strength and progressive collapse behaviors of plates subjected to combined compression and lateral pressure including the effects of initial imperfection had been presented by guedes soares and gordo 1996 a series of numerical and experimental investigations into the ultimate strength and residual ultimate strength of unstiffened and stiffened plates had been studied under combined biaxial compressive and lateral pressure loads and some simple formulas had been proposed to predicting the ultimate strength and residual ultimate strength with transverse and longitudinal cracks paik et al 1995 2005 2009a 2009b and also a series of model test about plates and stiffened plates had been investigated by xu et al 2012 2013a 2013b qi et al 2005 studied systematically the theoretical calculation approaches about evaluating ultimate strength of ships and ship shaped offshore structures such as fem isum sm simplified method and am advanced analytical method based on long time theoretical and experimental work in which some useful conclusions can be obtained through comparative investigations hirdaris et al 2014 had presented a review regarding the benchmark work of assessment of design loads for ship structures based on ultimate strength scaled model tests full scale surveys and theoretical approaches taking into account especially environmental and operational loads seo et al 2016 had numerically investigated the ultimate strength of stiffened curved plates subjected to axial compressive actions of which a total of 150 scaled models and over 400 study cases were adopted with different parameters such as slenderness ratio curvature web height and stiffener shapes to propose the equation for predicting the ultimate strength characteristics and post collapsed behaviors of stiffened curved plates the dynamic ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates had been numerically investigated by yang et al 2016 2018a 2018b iijima et al 2015 had performed ultimate strength test of scaled model to study the post ultimate strength progressive collapse behaviors of hull girder under whipping actions in which it can be concluded that the collapse area was smaller when whipping loads have shorter duration shi et al 2016 had studied the failure probability of hull girder subjected to combined loads like still water and wave induced loads taking into the effects of slamming loads shi and wang 2012a 2012b had studied the residual ultimate strength of cracked and open box girders respectively for ultimate strength investigations of model test for large scale ship and ship shaped offshore structures a lot of meaningful methods had been presented benson et al 2013 had experimental studied the ultimate and post ultimate strength behaviors of hull girder adopting three small scale box girder representing mid section of ship structure saad eldeen et al 2011a 2011b 2015 had performed a series of ultimate strength tests of box girders to obtain the progressive collapse characteristics post ultimate strength behaviors and the residual ultimate strength taking into account the effects of corrosion gordo and soares 2014 had experimentally studied the effects of spacing between transverse frames into the ultimate strength of hull girder using three steel box girders under pure vertical bending moment of which the dissipation of energy by plasticity and internal friction were evaluated sun et al 2003 had experimentally studied the torsional ultimate strength of hull girder with two ship hull models under pure torsion and cycle actions respectively shi et al 2012 had investigated the vertical bending ultimate strength of a container ship with scaled model under pure bending moment tanaka et al 2015 had also experimentally studied the ultimate strength for a 5 250 teu container ship with scaled model in which the combined loads were applied liu et al 2018 performed a scaled model experiment and obtained some useful and meaningful insights on the transverse ultimate strength of a swath ship in the present ulcs is considered as the representative of new type ship and will be more and more important ulcs represents a challenge in the design process where a significant role play estimation of design loads and ultimate strength of hull girder particular problem represent fact that dimensions of ulcs are outside the margin of the classification society s rules and those are not readily applicable new computational methods accounting for different loads responses of these ships are attempting to be used in their design such complex numerical methods are still under development and safety margin resulting from their implementation is actually unknown confidence in application of computational methods may be improved by comparison with model tests and numerical calculations thus this paper mainly figures out investigations into the longitudinal ultimate strength characteristics of ulcs through comparison between experiment and non linear finite element method however the detailed research work regarding ultimate strength characteristics of ulc are relatively rare from literature review in this paper a scaled model test regarding the ultimate longitudinal strength for a typical ultra large container ship is carried out the experiment is performed using a scaled model designed through similarity theory the numerical results of test model are compared with model test to verify the reliability of numerical method moreover three typical container ships are adopted and modeled as study case representing middle and ultra large container ships the collapse sequence the collapse mode the reason of final collapse and the differences between container ships of the progressive collapse behaviors are numerically discussed and presented 2 experimental procedure 2 1 model design designing a similar scale model of a true ship can be of particular significance for the ultimate strength experiment which can reflect the progressive collapse behaviors of the true ship because it is extremely expensive and difficult to conduct an experiment using a true ship similarity of geometry and loads parameters between the scale model and true ship has to be satisfied in scale model test overall scantlings of scale model like the section modulus the location of neutral axis and the inertia moment about neutral axis of cross section can be designed by geometry similarity along the longitudinal direction hull girder could be treated as a thin wall beam with varying cross sections geometry similarity could be obtained between scale model and true ship using thin wall mechanics theory in which internal bending and deformation could be expressed as the following 1 σ m w ε σ e θ ml ei yy v ml 2 ei yy where σ is the normal stress of hull girder cross section ε is the strain m is bending moment w is the section modulus in bending and e is the young s modulus θ is the beam rotation angle v is the displacement of mid beam l is beam length and ι yy is the moment of inertia about cross sectional neutral axis the geometric similarity relationship will be derived under the same boundary conditions as the following express 2 c σ c m c w c ε c σ c e c θ c m c l c e c iyy c v c m c l 2 c e c iyy where c denotes the similarity coefficient between real ship and test scale model the scantlings of cross section including local members should be optimized and satisfied eq 2 which means the objective function of geometry similarity criterion strength similarity criterion should also be taken into account in addition to the geometry similarity the critical stress of scale model is likely to be inconsistent with the true ship designing local members such as the scantling of stiffener the spacing between longitudinal girders or stiffeners and the longitudinal space of adjacent transverse frames with geometry similarity only which is linear scale at root local strength correction including elastic buckling and ultimate strength of panels and stiffened plates should be taken into account as shown in eq 3 5 respectively 3 σ e k π 2 e 12 1 v 2 t b 2 where σ e is the buckling strength of local panels k means buckling coefficient for the corresponding load and k a m b m b a 2 where m means the number of buckling half wave when 1 a b 2 m 1 when 2 a b 6 m 2 when 6 a b 3 m 3 when a b 3 m 4 v denotes the poisson s ratio t means plate thickness a and b are the length and width of plate respectively 4 σ u σ y 2 β 1 β 2 where σ u denotes the ultimate strength of local panels and the plate slenderness ratio β b t σ y e 5 σ u σ y 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 where σ u denotes the ultimate strength of local stiffener plates the range of this formula is applied to β 5 and λ 1 0 and β 1 25 if β 1 25 λ a π r σ y e r i a is the radius of gyration of the stiffener including associated full width plating i is the moment of inertia and a is the cross sectional area of the stiffener including associated full width plating the more detailed information and verifications about the similarity theory and model design including mesh sensitivity analysis are illustrated in our previous paper wang et al 2019 which is not stated again in this paper for the present study purpose according the similarity theory a similar scaled model of a typical ultra large container ship can be created for the model test regarding ultimate strength the cross section of the ultra large container ship i e the objective ship 10 000 teu container ship is shown in fig 1 the scantlings of scale model are presented in fig 2 the length and width of the whole test model is 3 m and 1 81 m respectively including transition and buffer block 2 2 experiment setup the container ship is statically in hogging condition when traveling and the ship is possible to collapse under hogging moment due to spring back when after the first sagging moment by slamming in rough sea the possibility of collapse under sagging moment is much smaller than that of under hogging moment in the case of container ship because of static hogging moment thus the hogging load case is more serious for container ships wang et al 2018 here the ultimate strength model test under hogging bending is simulated with a four point bending mechanism as shown in fig 3 including two buffer blocks loading arm which are used to produce bending moments and two transitions which are connected to buffer blocks for the force transitivity and should be more rigid than the test block so that the test block could collapse first two reaction frames are adopted to apply the loads through hydro cylinders as shown in fig 4 in which the bottom of bulkhead is simply supported at both end sections progressive collapse behavior characteristics of hull girder under hogging bending in actual situation could be obtained with this four point bending experiment setup the loads are applied as force and displacement forms respectively to analyze the uncertainty of the model experiment setup it can be emphasized that there is no apparent bifurcation phenomenon when the load as force form is applied but the applied load cannot be increased more when it exceeds the maximum load carrying capacity of the whole structure as shown in fig 5 the same progressive collapse process of the test model could be obtained with two different loading forms proving the stability of the experiment setup 2 3 initial deflection measurement the initial imperfections of construction members would be produced as a result of welding deflection and residual stress in the manufacture process as basically assumed initial imperfections will have a significant effect on the ultimate strength of hull girder but welding residual stress is not considered for study purpose in this paper and it should be noted that when the construction model is placed for a certain period of time some residual stress could be released and some cyclic loading in the elastic range of test model will be applied to release some residual stress before the collapse experiment nevertheless the effects of initial deflection should be accounted for and measured before ultimate strength model experiment for the following numerical analysis one kind of hand laser scanning system is adopted for the initial deflection measurement which uses the latest dynamic gauge points tracking image technology to accurately obtain the details of complex structures and quickly achieve the shape of object 3d model by professional optimization of the visual algorithm and multiple laser lines the whole set of equipment has a high degree of integration and convenience in actual operation firstly the gauge points are marked randomly in the outside plates of test model secondly the coordinates of every gauge point can be obtained by the hand laser scanning system finally the post welding initial deflection of plates can be fitted using the dates obtained by buckling mode based on double fourier series the process of initial measurement is presented in fig 6 2 4 standard specimen tensile test before the experiment it is necessary to conduct a tensile test for the standard specimen of the steel used to fabricate the model for obtaining the yield strength accurately for this model the plates of 8 mm 5 mm 4 mm and 3 mm thickness were selected as tensile specimens according to the plates used the dimensions of specimen are shown in fig 7 the tensile tests were conducted in structural mechanics laboratory the tensile test curve for specimens are shown in fig 8 the yield strength and properties of the material can be obtained by tensile test of the plate the engineering stress strain curve of the material can be directly obtained by the tensile test of the material but the true stress strain of the material should be used in the numerical calculation which can be obtained according to eq 6 6 ε t r u e ln 1 ε e n g σ t r u e σ e n g 1 ε e n g it can be seen that the yield strength of all kinds of specimens is 300 mpa and young s modulus is 201 gpa which should be adopted in the numerical calculation 2 5 strain gauges arrangement strain gauges can be used to monitor the collapse behaviors of hull girder shi and wang 2012 the damaged parts of hull girder under hogging bending moment are concentrated in the middle of the ship including the deck bottom plates and side shells thus single strain gauges are arranged along the ship length at five most possible collapsed sections as is shown in fig 9 most of the strain gauges are arranged on the middle of local plate and longitudinal strain gauges are mainly arranged on one side and only a small quantity is arranged at another side to verify the deformation symmetry and the repeatability of test data as is shown in fig 10 moreover some strain gauges are arranged at outboard side shell lengthwise to check the location of horizontal neutral axis based on numerical calculations and also at the location between the test and transition block to monitor the weld stress in case this location collapses first due to the insufficient weld strength meanwhile three displacement transducers are arranged below the test model at mid span of bulkhead in order to measure the vertical deformation of hull girder the arrangements of strain gauges and displacement transducers in practical model test are shown in fig 11 here the static strain testing analysis system dh3816 is used for output data of strain gauges and displacement transducer 3 experiment results analysis during the model experiment all the data can be recorded automatically at each loading step at the beginning of the model test the deformation of the model will be very small and still within the range of linear elasticity thus the applied load increment could be large relatively which however should be very small to facilitate the observation of the progressive collapse behaviors of the model components when the nonlinear range of the test model appears with the increase of the applied load the bending moment of the model is increasing and buckling will be shown in the plate under compression with the continuous expansion of the compression area the loading carrying capacity of the test model is gradually decreased the judgment for the ultimate limit state of test model is that the model will show a sudden large deformation phenomenon accompanying a loud noise when a small load is applied at this time the test model cannot continue to bear a larger load the corresponding bending moment is the ultimate strength of the model 3 1 ultimate strength curve the progressive collapse curve of the test model is presented in fig 12 in which the relationship of the experimental load displacement of the test model is shown e represents the proportional limit of load and u represents the maximum load the loading denotes loads applied by each hydraulic cylinder and the displacement denotes the measured results of bulkhead by the displacement transducer before the point e the linear relationship between the load and displacement of the model is very favorable indicating that the proportional limit of the loading load has not been reached when the applied load reaches around 95 tons the sound caused due to internal failure and deformation can be heard during the model test from the point e to u the slope of the curve slowly diminish with the increase of applied loads indicating the overall stiffness of whole structure gradually decreases meanwhile most of the structural members in the test section gradually become plastic when the applied loads continue to be increased significant failure deformation occurs in the test section and many strain gauges will peel off which indicates that the ultimate limit state of the test model has been reached thus the ultimate hogging bending strength of the test scaled model is 3553 5 kn m 1184 5 kn 3 m 3 2 collapse modes analysis the final collapse deformation shape of test model is presented in fig 13 it can be seen that the test model mainly collapses at section b due to buckling of outer bottom and nearly side shell plates which means the buckling of the bottom plates and the upper part of the side shell led to the overall collapse of the test model and it is obvious from the internal failure status that the inter bottom plates and the corresponding longitudinal stiffeners also have serious buckling deformation therefore the failure of the whole test model under the hogging bending moment is mainly caused by the buckling of the bottom plates and gradually expands to the side shell area the results of some strain gauges symmetrical with each other relative to the length direction of test model on section b no 14 and no 77 no 20 and no 79 no 25 and no 80 and no 28 and no 81 see fig 10 are presented in fig 14 it can be seen from fig 14 the results of each group of strain gauge are the same during the test process indicating that the suffered force and deformation of the test model have a good left and right symmetry meeting the requirements of ultimate strength test model the analysed value takes the material yield stress 300 mpa according to specimen tensile test i e the strain is around 1500 10 6 since the formulae of material mechanics for calculating the stresses is based on linear elasticity thus the values measured in the ultimate strength test can be neglected when exceeding this magnitude because the strain gauges will over flow in large plastic deformation the location of horizontal neutral axis of the test model measured is shown in fig 15 a from which it can be observed that the six strain gauges are within the range of linear elasticity during the whole model test indicating that the horizontal neutral axis is around this area and the line closest to the neutral axis is the strain gauge no 101 104 the progress of approximate vertical movement of the neutral axis is studied using the strain gauges provided at bay b as illustrated in fig 10 b choosing three typical states the proportional limit after the proportional limit and the ultimate limit as shown in fig 15 b from which it can be seen that when the test model reaches the ultimate strength the neutral axis has totally moved about 160 mm 1 2 distance from b 24 to b 21 towards the deck direction which also accord with smith method geometry similarity conditions are derived based on the assumption of uniaxial stress because when test model is subjected to hogging bending moment most members of structure are under uniaxial load and also in the model experiment normal stresses are measured thus the verification of normal stress similarity between true ship and scale model is conducted as shown in fig 16 a firstly it can be known that the normal stress of typical section of true ship and scale model are quite similar fig 16 b shows the measured results of strain gauges on the section b from which it is observed that the stress along the horizontal neutral axis of cross section is symmetrical according with the normal stress distribution of beam section under pure bending fig 17 shows the results of strain gauges in different cross sections at the same height of test model it can be seen that the changes of stress are basically the same for different cross sections of hull girder parallel middle body indicating that complex ship hull girder model can be simplified into a single frame model in the calculation of ultimate bending strength to study the progressive collapse behaviors of hull girder four typical points are adopted i e no 11 representing the outer bottom no 29 representing the upper deck no 20 representing the upper part of side shell and no 60 representing the inner bottom the results are presented in fig 18 according the slope of curves shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the upper deck that is the farthest from the horizontal neutral axis comes into tensile yielding stage firstly and then the outer bottom plates are compressed to fail then the inner bottom plating and a large area of side shell are compressed to fail finally the hull girder fails because of the buckling of double bottom structures 4 numerical analysis of ultimate strength for ulcs 4 1 comparison between the calculated and measured results of test model nonlinear finite element method for ultimate strength calculation is very convenient and common the accuracy of numerical calculation results can be verified by experiment the verification is taken into account from three aspects comparison of horizontal neutral axis comparison of ultimate strength value and comparison of progressive collapsed behaviors such as which member is collapsed first and how is the collapse developed for the accuracy of numerical calculation the finite element model should be closest to the real test model thus the model modification should be considered based on the tensile test of material the initial deformation measurement result and the weight correction due to plate thickness tolerance the finite element software abaqus cae is adopted to create the finite element model of the actual ship and scaled model in this paper the type of s4r and s3 elements are adopted which are four node doubly curved general purpose shell elements that can be used for reduced integration and three node triangular general purpose shell element respectively these types of elements could take membrane rigidity bending rigidity and large deflection into account during the numerical analysis and make computation less expensive and results more accurate shown in fig 19 is the fe model of scaled model test block of experiment setup and x y and z respectively means longitudinal transverse and vertical directions relevant discussions conducted in the following analysis are based on this coordinate system fig 20 shows the numerical calculation of horizontal neutral axis it can be seen that the numerical result is the same as the test result as stated about figs 11 d and fig 15 the comparison of ultimate strength between numerical calculation and model test is presented in fig 21 from which it can be seen that the ultimate strength of test model by numerical calculation is 1294 kn while the ultimate strength through test model is 1184 kn with an error of 8 5 in the elastic range of the model the two curves show a good agreement in the plastic stage the ultimate strength value is slightly different in fact when the applied load is around the ultimate limit state the test section of scaled model will be destroyed to a large extent at this time the strain values are too large to accurately be obtained in addition some plates buckled seriously meanwhile the deformation of the test model will be very large in a flash which will increase the difficulty of data collection correspondingly additionally the initial deformation residual stress and boundary conditions will affect or even change the ultimate strength of the structure to some extent moreover since the actual initial deformation and residual stress in the test specimen cannot be fully reflected in the numerical analysis there will be difference in local failure and deformation of some constituting members which could result in the numerical test deviation of ultimate capacity in general the test results can verify the reliability of the finite element analysis within the margin of error based on the existing similarity theory and model test the ultimate strength of longitudinal bending of an actual 10 000teu container ship can be calculated by eq 1 and eq 2 namely the ultimate bending strength of a real ship can be calculated by m p c σ c w m m after conversion the ultimate strength of the real ship under hogging bending is 1 83 10 10 nm 355 300 4350 3554 knm fig 22 shows the numerical calculations of progressive collapse behaviors for the test model it can be observed that the numerical analysis is the same as the measured results by model test as illustrated about fig 18 conclusions could be drawn for the hull girder under hogging bending that the members which are farthest from the horizontal neutral axis such as the deck and upper part of side shell will come into yield firstly then the outer bottom plating longitudinal stiffeners and parts of side shell begin to fail due to buckling under compression and meanwhile a large area of side shell above the neutral axis begin to yield due to tension stress and then failure of the inner bottom plating and longitudinal stiffeners gradually occurs due to compression finally the overall hull girder fails as a result of the collapse of double bottom structures due to compressive buckling moreover the final collapse mode is the same as the model test result see fig 13 a from comparisons between the numerical calculated and measured results of test model it can be observed that the accuracy and reliability of nonlinear finite element method can be verified 4 2 ultimate strength characteristics of ulcs in this section typical 4 000 teu 10 000teu and 20 000teu representing normal and ultra large container ships respectively are adopted as study cases to investigate the ultimate strength characteristics of ultra large container ship through numerical analysis longitudinal bending moment of ship hull girder is decreased gradually from mid ship to both ends thus the ultimate strength of ship can be determined by the maximum load carrying capacity of mid ship section as a study case in this paper one full hull compartment between two adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads located at mid ship is chosen to be analysed through nonlinear finite element method the typical cross section and main scantlings and most details of the three adopted object ships are shown in figs 1 and 23 and fig 24 in conjunction with tables 1 4 respectively the fe models of three object ships are shown in fig 25 in which the appropriate boundary condition takes the place of bulkheads representing its influence and imposed to the fe model the material of construction members is taken into account elastic perfectly plastic with yield stress of 315 mpa for ah material 355 mpa for eh36 material 390mpa for eh40 material and 460 mpa for eh47 material young s modulus is 2 06 105 mpa poisson s ratio is 0 3 and the density is 7 85 10 9 t mm3 some key influence factors of numerical calculation for ultimate strength such as mesh size initial imperfection load application and boundary conditions have been introduced in detail in previous paper wang et al 2018 which are not stated in this paper and numerical simulations presented below in this paper are performed adopting the method shown in that paper fig 26 shows the comparison of progressive collapse behaviors of these three typical container ships the sum of results are presented in table 5 it can be observed that the proportional elastic limit and ultimate strength of 10 000 teu container ship is twice that of 4 000 teu container ship and half that of 20 000 teu container ship in which the ultimate strength of 4 000 teu container ship is similar with that calculated as paik 2001 for the similar container ship indicating the nfem adopted in the present study is reliable the bending resistance of 10 000 teu container ship is four times that of 4 000 teu and the same as that of 20 000 teu container ship indicating the cross section scantlings of ultra large container ship are similar fig 27 shows the von mises stress distributions for the three type of container ship under vertical bending moment good agreement can be found between the collapse modes of the three type of container ships indicating progressive collapse behaviors of container ships are consistent 5 conclusions this paper investigated the ultimate longitudinal strength characteristics of ulcs through experimental and numerical analysis a detailed model test regarding ultimate strength of a similar scaled model for a typical 10 000 teu container ship under hogging bending moment was introduced the mechanical mechanism of ultimate strength and progressive collapse behaviors of hull girder are explained more intuitively from physical model experiment and the numerical calculation of the same test model was carried out the comparison between calculated and measured results was studied to investigate the accuracy and reliability of nfem taking into account the comparison of horizontal neutral axis ultimate strength value and progressive collapsed behaviors such as which member is collapsed first and how is the collapse developed moreover numerical analysis for three type of container ships representing middle and ultra large container ships respectively was carried out to investigate the ultimate strength characteristics of ulcs based on the model test and computed numerical calculations from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 based on the model test results the symmetry of hull girder was studied firstly the results show that the ship cross section stress along the horizontal neutral axis has a good symmetry which conforms to the distribution law of normal stress on the beam section under pure bending moment indicating beam bending theory can be applied to hull girder 2 the stress vs strain relationship at different cross sections under the same ship height is basically the same which indicates the unity of the cross sections of hull girder in mid ship in addition the complex ship hull girder can be simplified into a single frame model to facilitate the calculation of ultimate bending strength 3 the progressive collapse behaviors was obtained according to model test yield failure occurred first farthest from the horizontal neutral axis of the model under tensile stress such as upper deck and the tensile stress of hull girder gradually expanded to the upper part of side shell then buckling failure occurred under compression like outer bottom and the compressive stress gradually expanded to the lower part of side shell meanwhile inner bottom plating and corresponding stiffeners gradually buckled due to increasing compression when the buckling deformation of double bottom plates was very large and the whole structure will not be able to bear larger load the ultimate limit state is reached 4 the numerical calculation and experimental results are compared in three aspects the position of horizontal neutral axis the ultimate strength curve and the progressive collapse behaviors including the sequence and development of model failure all the results are consistent which verified the accuracy and reliability of nfem 5 progressive collapse behaviors of ultra large container ships are similar with middle container ships but the proportional elastic limit and ultimate strength are very different from each other which are almost multiplied with the cargo capacity which can provide a reference for the ship structure design of different type of container ships in the future task further experiments are encouraged to be performed regarding ultimate strength investigation of ultra large container ships such as torsion model test and combined loads model test for obtaining adequate more detailed insights into the collapse behaviors of hull girder to help cognize ultimate strength of ulcs more comprehensively

22357,this paper figures out investigations into the ultimate strength of ultra large container ships ulcs both the experiment and non linear finite element method nfem are utilized to evaluate the ultimate longitudinal strength behaviors of hull girder for ulcs in this study firstly an experiment regarding the similar model is carried out to examine the characteristics of the ultimate longitudinal strength of the ultra large container ship s hull girder structures the test model is designed by similar theory to reflect the progressive collapse behaviors of actual hull girder under hogging bending moment secondly the results of simulations performed by numerical analysis into hull girder ultimate strength are compared with the experimental results the results show good agreement with model test demonstrating the reliability of nfem finally a series of non linear finite element analysis is performed to assess the ultimate strength of hull girder taking into account the effects of initial imperfections and both material and geometric nonlinearities in which the typical 4 000 teu 10 000 teu and 20 000 teu representing normal and ultra large container ships are adopted as study cases to clarify the ultimate strength characteristics of ulcs this analysis can help to cognize the ultimate longitudinal strength of ulcs keywords ultimate strength ulcs progressive collapse behaviors similar model experimental investigations nfem 1 introduction knowing the maximum load carrying capacity of actual hull girder is very important in the structural ultimate limit state design for ships and offshore structures of which the ultimate longitudinal strength is especially important usually referring to as the maximum hull girder ultimate strength there are big advantages in the process of transporting goods for container ships such as high loading unloading efficiency and small wastage therefore container ships become larger and larger with the recent increasing economy however ultra large container ships will encounter more problems regarding strength due to big scale and high speed actually whipping is very important for the verification of the ultimate bending moment capacity of the hull girder because whipping response may significantly increase the wave frequency vertical wave bending moment meanwhile for ulcs whipping loads are extremely sensitive to the ship speed and the effect on wave induced loads will be further amplified under high ship speed jasna et al 2014 there have been many news about hull girder rupture for ultra large container ships at present ultimate longitudinal strength assessment of a typical ultra large container ship is taken into account in this paper through experimental and numerical analysis the torsional ultimate strength is not considered although it is important for ulcs due to large deck opening but for the present study purpose it focuses on the main ultimate strength relatively for ship structures i e the ultimate longitudinal strength there have been many research works conducted on the ultimate strength behaviors of hull girder including local members such as plates stiffened panels and box girders the formulas assessing the ultimate strength and progressive collapse behaviors of plates subjected to combined compression and lateral pressure including the effects of initial imperfection had been presented by guedes soares and gordo 1996 a series of numerical and experimental investigations into the ultimate strength and residual ultimate strength of unstiffened and stiffened plates had been studied under combined biaxial compressive and lateral pressure loads and some simple formulas had been proposed to predicting the ultimate strength and residual ultimate strength with transverse and longitudinal cracks paik et al 1995 2005 2009a 2009b and also a series of model test about plates and stiffened plates had been investigated by xu et al 2012 2013a 2013b qi et al 2005 studied systematically the theoretical calculation approaches about evaluating ultimate strength of ships and ship shaped offshore structures such as fem isum sm simplified method and am advanced analytical method based on long time theoretical and experimental work in which some useful conclusions can be obtained through comparative investigations hirdaris et al 2014 had presented a review regarding the benchmark work of assessment of design loads for ship structures based on ultimate strength scaled model tests full scale surveys and theoretical approaches taking into account especially environmental and operational loads seo et al 2016 had numerically investigated the ultimate strength of stiffened curved plates subjected to axial compressive actions of which a total of 150 scaled models and over 400 study cases were adopted with different parameters such as slenderness ratio curvature web height and stiffener shapes to propose the equation for predicting the ultimate strength characteristics and post collapsed behaviors of stiffened curved plates the dynamic ultimate strength of plates and stiffened plates had been numerically investigated by yang et al 2016 2018a 2018b iijima et al 2015 had performed ultimate strength test of scaled model to study the post ultimate strength progressive collapse behaviors of hull girder under whipping actions in which it can be concluded that the collapse area was smaller when whipping loads have shorter duration shi et al 2016 had studied the failure probability of hull girder subjected to combined loads like still water and wave induced loads taking into the effects of slamming loads shi and wang 2012a 2012b had studied the residual ultimate strength of cracked and open box girders respectively for ultimate strength investigations of model test for large scale ship and ship shaped offshore structures a lot of meaningful methods had been presented benson et al 2013 had experimental studied the ultimate and post ultimate strength behaviors of hull girder adopting three small scale box girder representing mid section of ship structure saad eldeen et al 2011a 2011b 2015 had performed a series of ultimate strength tests of box girders to obtain the progressive collapse characteristics post ultimate strength behaviors and the residual ultimate strength taking into account the effects of corrosion gordo and soares 2014 had experimentally studied the effects of spacing between transverse frames into the ultimate strength of hull girder using three steel box girders under pure vertical bending moment of which the dissipation of energy by plasticity and internal friction were evaluated sun et al 2003 had experimentally studied the torsional ultimate strength of hull girder with two ship hull models under pure torsion and cycle actions respectively shi et al 2012 had investigated the vertical bending ultimate strength of a container ship with scaled model under pure bending moment tanaka et al 2015 had also experimentally studied the ultimate strength for a 5 250 teu container ship with scaled model in which the combined loads were applied liu et al 2018 performed a scaled model experiment and obtained some useful and meaningful insights on the transverse ultimate strength of a swath ship in the present ulcs is considered as the representative of new type ship and will be more and more important ulcs represents a challenge in the design process where a significant role play estimation of design loads and ultimate strength of hull girder particular problem represent fact that dimensions of ulcs are outside the margin of the classification society s rules and those are not readily applicable new computational methods accounting for different loads responses of these ships are attempting to be used in their design such complex numerical methods are still under development and safety margin resulting from their implementation is actually unknown confidence in application of computational methods may be improved by comparison with model tests and numerical calculations thus this paper mainly figures out investigations into the longitudinal ultimate strength characteristics of ulcs through comparison between experiment and non linear finite element method however the detailed research work regarding ultimate strength characteristics of ulc are relatively rare from literature review in this paper a scaled model test regarding the ultimate longitudinal strength for a typical ultra large container ship is carried out the experiment is performed using a scaled model designed through similarity theory the numerical results of test model are compared with model test to verify the reliability of numerical method moreover three typical container ships are adopted and modeled as study case representing middle and ultra large container ships the collapse sequence the collapse mode the reason of final collapse and the differences between container ships of the progressive collapse behaviors are numerically discussed and presented 2 experimental procedure 2 1 model design designing a similar scale model of a true ship can be of particular significance for the ultimate strength experiment which can reflect the progressive collapse behaviors of the true ship because it is extremely expensive and difficult to conduct an experiment using a true ship similarity of geometry and loads parameters between the scale model and true ship has to be satisfied in scale model test overall scantlings of scale model like the section modulus the location of neutral axis and the inertia moment about neutral axis of cross section can be designed by geometry similarity along the longitudinal direction hull girder could be treated as a thin wall beam with varying cross sections geometry similarity could be obtained between scale model and true ship using thin wall mechanics theory in which internal bending and deformation could be expressed as the following 1 σ m w ε σ e θ ml ei yy v ml 2 ei yy where σ is the normal stress of hull girder cross section ε is the strain m is bending moment w is the section modulus in bending and e is the young s modulus θ is the beam rotation angle v is the displacement of mid beam l is beam length and ι yy is the moment of inertia about cross sectional neutral axis the geometric similarity relationship will be derived under the same boundary conditions as the following express 2 c σ c m c w c ε c σ c e c θ c m c l c e c iyy c v c m c l 2 c e c iyy where c denotes the similarity coefficient between real ship and test scale model the scantlings of cross section including local members should be optimized and satisfied eq 2 which means the objective function of geometry similarity criterion strength similarity criterion should also be taken into account in addition to the geometry similarity the critical stress of scale model is likely to be inconsistent with the true ship designing local members such as the scantling of stiffener the spacing between longitudinal girders or stiffeners and the longitudinal space of adjacent transverse frames with geometry similarity only which is linear scale at root local strength correction including elastic buckling and ultimate strength of panels and stiffened plates should be taken into account as shown in eq 3 5 respectively 3 σ e k π 2 e 12 1 v 2 t b 2 where σ e is the buckling strength of local panels k means buckling coefficient for the corresponding load and k a m b m b a 2 where m means the number of buckling half wave when 1 a b 2 m 1 when 2 a b 6 m 2 when 6 a b 3 m 3 when a b 3 m 4 v denotes the poisson s ratio t means plate thickness a and b are the length and width of plate respectively 4 σ u σ y 2 β 1 β 2 where σ u denotes the ultimate strength of local panels and the plate slenderness ratio β b t σ y e 5 σ u σ y 1 β 0 28 1 1 λ 3 2 where σ u denotes the ultimate strength of local stiffener plates the range of this formula is applied to β 5 and λ 1 0 and β 1 25 if β 1 25 λ a π r σ y e r i a is the radius of gyration of the stiffener including associated full width plating i is the moment of inertia and a is the cross sectional area of the stiffener including associated full width plating the more detailed information and verifications about the similarity theory and model design including mesh sensitivity analysis are illustrated in our previous paper wang et al 2019 which is not stated again in this paper for the present study purpose according the similarity theory a similar scaled model of a typical ultra large container ship can be created for the model test regarding ultimate strength the cross section of the ultra large container ship i e the objective ship 10 000 teu container ship is shown in fig 1 the scantlings of scale model are presented in fig 2 the length and width of the whole test model is 3 m and 1 81 m respectively including transition and buffer block 2 2 experiment setup the container ship is statically in hogging condition when traveling and the ship is possible to collapse under hogging moment due to spring back when after the first sagging moment by slamming in rough sea the possibility of collapse under sagging moment is much smaller than that of under hogging moment in the case of container ship because of static hogging moment thus the hogging load case is more serious for container ships wang et al 2018 here the ultimate strength model test under hogging bending is simulated with a four point bending mechanism as shown in fig 3 including two buffer blocks loading arm which are used to produce bending moments and two transitions which are connected to buffer blocks for the force transitivity and should be more rigid than the test block so that the test block could collapse first two reaction frames are adopted to apply the loads through hydro cylinders as shown in fig 4 in which the bottom of bulkhead is simply supported at both end sections progressive collapse behavior characteristics of hull girder under hogging bending in actual situation could be obtained with this four point bending experiment setup the loads are applied as force and displacement forms respectively to analyze the uncertainty of the model experiment setup it can be emphasized that there is no apparent bifurcation phenomenon when the load as force form is applied but the applied load cannot be increased more when it exceeds the maximum load carrying capacity of the whole structure as shown in fig 5 the same progressive collapse process of the test model could be obtained with two different loading forms proving the stability of the experiment setup 2 3 initial deflection measurement the initial imperfections of construction members would be produced as a result of welding deflection and residual stress in the manufacture process as basically assumed initial imperfections will have a significant effect on the ultimate strength of hull girder but welding residual stress is not considered for study purpose in this paper and it should be noted that when the construction model is placed for a certain period of time some residual stress could be released and some cyclic loading in the elastic range of test model will be applied to release some residual stress before the collapse experiment nevertheless the effects of initial deflection should be accounted for and measured before ultimate strength model experiment for the following numerical analysis one kind of hand laser scanning system is adopted for the initial deflection measurement which uses the latest dynamic gauge points tracking image technology to accurately obtain the details of complex structures and quickly achieve the shape of object 3d model by professional optimization of the visual algorithm and multiple laser lines the whole set of equipment has a high degree of integration and convenience in actual operation firstly the gauge points are marked randomly in the outside plates of test model secondly the coordinates of every gauge point can be obtained by the hand laser scanning system finally the post welding initial deflection of plates can be fitted using the dates obtained by buckling mode based on double fourier series the process of initial measurement is presented in fig 6 2 4 standard specimen tensile test before the experiment it is necessary to conduct a tensile test for the standard specimen of the steel used to fabricate the model for obtaining the yield strength accurately for this model the plates of 8 mm 5 mm 4 mm and 3 mm thickness were selected as tensile specimens according to the plates used the dimensions of specimen are shown in fig 7 the tensile tests were conducted in structural mechanics laboratory the tensile test curve for specimens are shown in fig 8 the yield strength and properties of the material can be obtained by tensile test of the plate the engineering stress strain curve of the material can be directly obtained by the tensile test of the material but the true stress strain of the material should be used in the numerical calculation which can be obtained according to eq 6 6 ε t r u e ln 1 ε e n g σ t r u e σ e n g 1 ε e n g it can be seen that the yield strength of all kinds of specimens is 300 mpa and young s modulus is 201 gpa which should be adopted in the numerical calculation 2 5 strain gauges arrangement strain gauges can be used to monitor the collapse behaviors of hull girder shi and wang 2012 the damaged parts of hull girder under hogging bending moment are concentrated in the middle of the ship including the deck bottom plates and side shells thus single strain gauges are arranged along the ship length at five most possible collapsed sections as is shown in fig 9 most of the strain gauges are arranged on the middle of local plate and longitudinal strain gauges are mainly arranged on one side and only a small quantity is arranged at another side to verify the deformation symmetry and the repeatability of test data as is shown in fig 10 moreover some strain gauges are arranged at outboard side shell lengthwise to check the location of horizontal neutral axis based on numerical calculations and also at the location between the test and transition block to monitor the weld stress in case this location collapses first due to the insufficient weld strength meanwhile three displacement transducers are arranged below the test model at mid span of bulkhead in order to measure the vertical deformation of hull girder the arrangements of strain gauges and displacement transducers in practical model test are shown in fig 11 here the static strain testing analysis system dh3816 is used for output data of strain gauges and displacement transducer 3 experiment results analysis during the model experiment all the data can be recorded automatically at each loading step at the beginning of the model test the deformation of the model will be very small and still within the range of linear elasticity thus the applied load increment could be large relatively which however should be very small to facilitate the observation of the progressive collapse behaviors of the model components when the nonlinear range of the test model appears with the increase of the applied load the bending moment of the model is increasing and buckling will be shown in the plate under compression with the continuous expansion of the compression area the loading carrying capacity of the test model is gradually decreased the judgment for the ultimate limit state of test model is that the model will show a sudden large deformation phenomenon accompanying a loud noise when a small load is applied at this time the test model cannot continue to bear a larger load the corresponding bending moment is the ultimate strength of the model 3 1 ultimate strength curve the progressive collapse curve of the test model is presented in fig 12 in which the relationship of the experimental load displacement of the test model is shown e represents the proportional limit of load and u represents the maximum load the loading denotes loads applied by each hydraulic cylinder and the displacement denotes the measured results of bulkhead by the displacement transducer before the point e the linear relationship between the load and displacement of the model is very favorable indicating that the proportional limit of the loading load has not been reached when the applied load reaches around 95 tons the sound caused due to internal failure and deformation can be heard during the model test from the point e to u the slope of the curve slowly diminish with the increase of applied loads indicating the overall stiffness of whole structure gradually decreases meanwhile most of the structural members in the test section gradually become plastic when the applied loads continue to be increased significant failure deformation occurs in the test section and many strain gauges will peel off which indicates that the ultimate limit state of the test model has been reached thus the ultimate hogging bending strength of the test scaled model is 3553 5 kn m 1184 5 kn 3 m 3 2 collapse modes analysis the final collapse deformation shape of test model is presented in fig 13 it can be seen that the test model mainly collapses at section b due to buckling of outer bottom and nearly side shell plates which means the buckling of the bottom plates and the upper part of the side shell led to the overall collapse of the test model and it is obvious from the internal failure status that the inter bottom plates and the corresponding longitudinal stiffeners also have serious buckling deformation therefore the failure of the whole test model under the hogging bending moment is mainly caused by the buckling of the bottom plates and gradually expands to the side shell area the results of some strain gauges symmetrical with each other relative to the length direction of test model on section b no 14 and no 77 no 20 and no 79 no 25 and no 80 and no 28 and no 81 see fig 10 are presented in fig 14 it can be seen from fig 14 the results of each group of strain gauge are the same during the test process indicating that the suffered force and deformation of the test model have a good left and right symmetry meeting the requirements of ultimate strength test model the analysed value takes the material yield stress 300 mpa according to specimen tensile test i e the strain is around 1500 10 6 since the formulae of material mechanics for calculating the stresses is based on linear elasticity thus the values measured in the ultimate strength test can be neglected when exceeding this magnitude because the strain gauges will over flow in large plastic deformation the location of horizontal neutral axis of the test model measured is shown in fig 15 a from which it can be observed that the six strain gauges are within the range of linear elasticity during the whole model test indicating that the horizontal neutral axis is around this area and the line closest to the neutral axis is the strain gauge no 101 104 the progress of approximate vertical movement of the neutral axis is studied using the strain gauges provided at bay b as illustrated in fig 10 b choosing three typical states the proportional limit after the proportional limit and the ultimate limit as shown in fig 15 b from which it can be seen that when the test model reaches the ultimate strength the neutral axis has totally moved about 160 mm 1 2 distance from b 24 to b 21 towards the deck direction which also accord with smith method geometry similarity conditions are derived based on the assumption of uniaxial stress because when test model is subjected to hogging bending moment most members of structure are under uniaxial load and also in the model experiment normal stresses are measured thus the verification of normal stress similarity between true ship and scale model is conducted as shown in fig 16 a firstly it can be known that the normal stress of typical section of true ship and scale model are quite similar fig 16 b shows the measured results of strain gauges on the section b from which it is observed that the stress along the horizontal neutral axis of cross section is symmetrical according with the normal stress distribution of beam section under pure bending fig 17 shows the results of strain gauges in different cross sections at the same height of test model it can be seen that the changes of stress are basically the same for different cross sections of hull girder parallel middle body indicating that complex ship hull girder model can be simplified into a single frame model in the calculation of ultimate bending strength to study the progressive collapse behaviors of hull girder four typical points are adopted i e no 11 representing the outer bottom no 29 representing the upper deck no 20 representing the upper part of side shell and no 60 representing the inner bottom the results are presented in fig 18 according the slope of curves shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the upper deck that is the farthest from the horizontal neutral axis comes into tensile yielding stage firstly and then the outer bottom plates are compressed to fail then the inner bottom plating and a large area of side shell are compressed to fail finally the hull girder fails because of the buckling of double bottom structures 4 numerical analysis of ultimate strength for ulcs 4 1 comparison between the calculated and measured results of test model nonlinear finite element method for ultimate strength calculation is very convenient and common the accuracy of numerical calculation results can be verified by experiment the verification is taken into account from three aspects comparison of horizontal neutral axis comparison of ultimate strength value and comparison of progressive collapsed behaviors such as which member is collapsed first and how is the collapse developed for the accuracy of numerical calculation the finite element model should be closest to the real test model thus the model modification should be considered based on the tensile test of material the initial deformation measurement result and the weight correction due to plate thickness tolerance the finite element software abaqus cae is adopted to create the finite element model of the actual ship and scaled model in this paper the type of s4r and s3 elements are adopted which are four node doubly curved general purpose shell elements that can be used for reduced integration and three node triangular general purpose shell element respectively these types of elements could take membrane rigidity bending rigidity and large deflection into account during the numerical analysis and make computation less expensive and results more accurate shown in fig 19 is the fe model of scaled model test block of experiment setup and x y and z respectively means longitudinal transverse and vertical directions relevant discussions conducted in the following analysis are based on this coordinate system fig 20 shows the numerical calculation of horizontal neutral axis it can be seen that the numerical result is the same as the test result as stated about figs 11 d and fig 15 the comparison of ultimate strength between numerical calculation and model test is presented in fig 21 from which it can be seen that the ultimate strength of test model by numerical calculation is 1294 kn while the ultimate strength through test model is 1184 kn with an error of 8 5 in the elastic range of the model the two curves show a good agreement in the plastic stage the ultimate strength value is slightly different in fact when the applied load is around the ultimate limit state the test section of scaled model will be destroyed to a large extent at this time the strain values are too large to accurately be obtained in addition some plates buckled seriously meanwhile the deformation of the test model will be very large in a flash which will increase the difficulty of data collection correspondingly additionally the initial deformation residual stress and boundary conditions will affect or even change the ultimate strength of the structure to some extent moreover since the actual initial deformation and residual stress in the test specimen cannot be fully reflected in the numerical analysis there will be difference in local failure and deformation of some constituting members which could result in the numerical test deviation of ultimate capacity in general the test results can verify the reliability of the finite element analysis within the margin of error based on the existing similarity theory and model test the ultimate strength of longitudinal bending of an actual 10 000teu container ship can be calculated by eq 1 and eq 2 namely the ultimate bending strength of a real ship can be calculated by m p c σ c w m m after conversion the ultimate strength of the real ship under hogging bending is 1 83 10 10 nm 355 300 4350 3554 knm fig 22 shows the numerical calculations of progressive collapse behaviors for the test model it can be observed that the numerical analysis is the same as the measured results by model test as illustrated about fig 18 conclusions could be drawn for the hull girder under hogging bending that the members which are farthest from the horizontal neutral axis such as the deck and upper part of side shell will come into yield firstly then the outer bottom plating longitudinal stiffeners and parts of side shell begin to fail due to buckling under compression and meanwhile a large area of side shell above the neutral axis begin to yield due to tension stress and then failure of the inner bottom plating and longitudinal stiffeners gradually occurs due to compression finally the overall hull girder fails as a result of the collapse of double bottom structures due to compressive buckling moreover the final collapse mode is the same as the model test result see fig 13 a from comparisons between the numerical calculated and measured results of test model it can be observed that the accuracy and reliability of nonlinear finite element method can be verified 4 2 ultimate strength characteristics of ulcs in this section typical 4 000 teu 10 000teu and 20 000teu representing normal and ultra large container ships respectively are adopted as study cases to investigate the ultimate strength characteristics of ultra large container ship through numerical analysis longitudinal bending moment of ship hull girder is decreased gradually from mid ship to both ends thus the ultimate strength of ship can be determined by the maximum load carrying capacity of mid ship section as a study case in this paper one full hull compartment between two adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads located at mid ship is chosen to be analysed through nonlinear finite element method the typical cross section and main scantlings and most details of the three adopted object ships are shown in figs 1 and 23 and fig 24 in conjunction with tables 1 4 respectively the fe models of three object ships are shown in fig 25 in which the appropriate boundary condition takes the place of bulkheads representing its influence and imposed to the fe model the material of construction members is taken into account elastic perfectly plastic with yield stress of 315 mpa for ah material 355 mpa for eh36 material 390mpa for eh40 material and 460 mpa for eh47 material young s modulus is 2 06 105 mpa poisson s ratio is 0 3 and the density is 7 85 10 9 t mm3 some key influence factors of numerical calculation for ultimate strength such as mesh size initial imperfection load application and boundary conditions have been introduced in detail in previous paper wang et al 2018 which are not stated in this paper and numerical simulations presented below in this paper are performed adopting the method shown in that paper fig 26 shows the comparison of progressive collapse behaviors of these three typical container ships the sum of results are presented in table 5 it can be observed that the proportional elastic limit and ultimate strength of 10 000 teu container ship is twice that of 4 000 teu container ship and half that of 20 000 teu container ship in which the ultimate strength of 4 000 teu container ship is similar with that calculated as paik 2001 for the similar container ship indicating the nfem adopted in the present study is reliable the bending resistance of 10 000 teu container ship is four times that of 4 000 teu and the same as that of 20 000 teu container ship indicating the cross section scantlings of ultra large container ship are similar fig 27 shows the von mises stress distributions for the three type of container ship under vertical bending moment good agreement can be found between the collapse modes of the three type of container ships indicating progressive collapse behaviors of container ships are consistent 5 conclusions this paper investigated the ultimate longitudinal strength characteristics of ulcs through experimental and numerical analysis a detailed model test regarding ultimate strength of a similar scaled model for a typical 10 000 teu container ship under hogging bending moment was introduced the mechanical mechanism of ultimate strength and progressive collapse behaviors of hull girder are explained more intuitively from physical model experiment and the numerical calculation of the same test model was carried out the comparison between calculated and measured results was studied to investigate the accuracy and reliability of nfem taking into account the comparison of horizontal neutral axis ultimate strength value and progressive collapsed behaviors such as which member is collapsed first and how is the collapse developed moreover numerical analysis for three type of container ships representing middle and ultra large container ships respectively was carried out to investigate the ultimate strength characteristics of ulcs based on the model test and computed numerical calculations from the present study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 based on the model test results the symmetry of hull girder was studied firstly the results show that the ship cross section stress along the horizontal neutral axis has a good symmetry which conforms to the distribution law of normal stress on the beam section under pure bending moment indicating beam bending theory can be applied to hull girder 2 the stress vs strain relationship at different cross sections under the same ship height is basically the same which indicates the unity of the cross sections of hull girder in mid ship in addition the complex ship hull girder can be simplified into a single frame model to facilitate the calculation of ultimate bending strength 3 the progressive collapse behaviors was obtained according to model test yield failure occurred first farthest from the horizontal neutral axis of the model under tensile stress such as upper deck and the tensile stress of hull girder gradually expanded to the upper part of side shell then buckling failure occurred under compression like outer bottom and the compressive stress gradually expanded to the lower part of side shell meanwhile inner bottom plating and corresponding stiffeners gradually buckled due to increasing compression when the buckling deformation of double bottom plates was very large and the whole structure will not be able to bear larger load the ultimate limit state is reached 4 the numerical calculation and experimental results are compared in three aspects the position of horizontal neutral axis the ultimate strength curve and the progressive collapse behaviors including the sequence and development of model failure all the results are consistent which verified the accuracy and reliability of nfem 5 progressive collapse behaviors of ultra large container ships are similar with middle container ships but the proportional elastic limit and ultimate strength are very different from each other which are almost multiplied with the cargo capacity which can provide a reference for the ship structure design of different type of container ships in the future task further experiments are encouraged to be performed regarding ultimate strength investigation of ultra large container ships such as torsion model test and combined loads model test for obtaining adequate more detailed insights into the collapse behaviors of hull girder to help cognize ultimate strength of ulcs more comprehensively

22358,structural control of a system can be achieved by employing different control methods the effectiveness of a control technique straightly depends on the performance of the control device among control devices the tuned liquid column gas damper tlcgd has shown high vibration control capabilities in this study a newly developed damping system as a tuned liquid column ball gas damper tlcbgd system is introduced the developed system is a combined version of a tuned liquid column ball damper tlcbd and a tlcgd system the new damper is utilized on an offshore jacket platform and its qualification is studied under both regular and irregular wave incidences the efficiency of the tlcbgd system is investigated numerically by implementing ball tube ratio and gas pressure parameters the effects of the ball tube ratios and the gas pressure values on the vibration suppression capacity of the system are assessed through a parametric study in comparison to a passive tlcgd system the results revealed that the utilizing a tlcbgd system in the jacket platform improves the structural vibration suppression capability keywords passive structural control offshore jacket platform tuned liquid column ball damper gas spring tlcbgd 1 introduction vicious weather conditions can cause different kinds of load impacts on the offshore structures these impacts induce significant vibrations and local and global damage in some circumstances there are several reports related to the structural damage of the floating and the fixed offshore structures after hurricanes van raaji 1996 to improve the whole structural performance some uncertainty reduction methods can be employed based on a requalification process hokmabady et al 2018 hosseinlou and mojtahedi 2016 requalification which can be defined as a structural behavior improvement procedure through small or large modifications might be required because of the structural damage nowadays a high number of installed platforms are reaching the end of their design lifetime requiring a requalification furthermore requalification is not just a cure stage process and its consideration can improve structural reliability this procedure can also be defined through earlier stages in the platform s life span increasing topside weight or operational loads reducing capacity because of damage identification of damage procedures hosseinlou and mojtahedi 2016 mojtahedi et al 2019 and increasing knowledge related to the material behavior or even increasing whole structural vibrational suppression capability through structural control systems and algorithms som and das 2018 structural control devices perform based on vibrational energy absorption capability to keep the primary structure out of serious structural damage the absorption occurs through the energy transfer process from the critical modes of the building to the dynamic damping systems chuan 2008 development of vibration absorber devices has always been the theoretical or the experimental research subjects in the engineering fields due to their high capability in improving reliability and structural performance among these devices tuned liquid column dampers tlcd which consists of a rigid u shaped tube with an orifice in the middle filled with a liquid mostly water has shown to be effective in reducing the structural vibrations coudurier et al 2018 chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 ghosh and basu 2004 colwell and basu 2009 yalla et al 2001 the main limitation of these devices is their best performance in a specific frequency ratio traditional tlcd systems disadvantages even by considering a semi active procedure are significant enough to consider them as inefficient devices colwell and basu 2009 however covering a wide range of external loading excitations can be achieved through employing a hybrid tlcd htlcd a semi active tlcd stlcd considering smart material such as magneto rheological fluids mr tlcd ni et al 2004 wang et al 2005 replacing the linear spring of lcd system with a spring made of shape memory alloy sma lcd gur et al 2014 utilizing a novel mr tlcgd system hokmabady et al 2019 and so forth al saif et al 2011 modified a tlcd by substituting a rolling steel ball with the traditional orifice in the horizontal column of the tlcd and introduced tuned liquid column ball damper tlcbd in a tlcbd system the ball performs as a movable orifice dissipating the liquid column movement energy to improve the damper response reduction capability gur et al 2014 however a modified version of the tlcbd system called the circular liquid column ball damper clcbd was also studied and proposed for controlling torsionally coupled vibration pandey and mishra 2018 although tlcbd system improves the absorber attenuation performance the system limitations are yet existed the limitations of tlcds are also conquered through some ideas such as considering a gas damper called a tuned liquid column gas damper tlcgd hochrainer and ziegler 2006 hochrainer and fotiu 2018 the effects of an air spring gas spring are reflected by a tlcgd damper within the trapped air at the end of vertical columns to tune the damper frequency as of the most important weak point of tlcds basically a tlcgd is too similar to a tlcd system but the main difference arises from its flexibility in frequency regulation which is tuned by adjusting the gas pressure in the vertical columns mousavi et al 2012 2013 the frequency of a tlcgd system can be extended up to 5 hz employing passive gas spring effects a combined novel tlcbgd system mainly increases the system damping and decreases the displacement of the liquid as of the advantages of a tlcbd system and also increases the system stiffness as of the advantage of a tlcgd system however the combined tlcbgd damping system includes advantages of both damping systems it also covers the tlcgd system weakness which is the limitations in damper liquid movement due to the above mentioned concepts and the capability of tlcgd systems in absorbing the system vibration utilizing a rolling ball instead of a fixed orifice within a tlcgd system and considering a novel tlcbgd system would be a suitable choice to increase the system reliability and gathering both ball and gas dampers features within a unit damping system this study evaluates the capability and the effectiveness of a novel developed tlcbgd system under both regular and irregular wave loads on a three dimensional offshore jacket platform the efficiency of the gas pressure values and the ball tube ratios ball size in providing required damping properties and structural vibration reduction capability are investigated simultaneously for the first time in the field of structural control the results indicate the effectiveness of the tlcbgd damping system in decreasing the vibration of the whole system under wave loads results also show that the highest vibration suppression occurs in lower values of gas pressure and almost lower ball tube ratios 2 a tlcbgd system modeling a tlcgbd system consists of a tlcgd and a tlcbd system which can be defined as a tuned liquid column damper with a rolling ball as a moveable orifice in the horizontal column and two gas dampers gas springs in both vertical columns see fig 1 the main equation of motion of the combined tlcbd and tlcgd system requires a precise description of a tlcgd system including a rolling ball a tlcgd system includes a normal liquid such as water in which two trapped air volumes are existed at the end of each vertical column the adjustable air pressure can control the frequency of the damper to increase the whole system efficiency the mechanism of a tlcbgd system can be considered as the simultaneous performance of a tlcbd higher system damping and a tlcgd higher system stiffness system as it is shown in fig 1 y denotes the displacement of the liquid in the vertical columns x is the horizontal displacement of

volume of the closed air columns p v as the system excited by any lateral load the p v relationship can be expressed by the general polytropic relation p v γ c as a constant value in which γ is the index of polytropic the gas spring acts under isothermal conditions γ 1 in slower velocities while in high frequencies an adiabatic change occurs and the index value changes to γ 1 4 in any other circumstances γ takes a value in a range between 1 and 1 4 mousavi et al 2013 by utilization of p 0 v 0 p v γ at a time instant and replacing p and also proposing v v 0 a y or d v d y a d eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 k d γ a d 2 p 0 v 0 1 a y v 0 γ 1 based on eq 2 the gas spring stiffness is nonlinear and for small liquid displacement y t the linearized air spring stiffness can be given as bhattacharyya et al 2017 3 k d γ a d 2 p 0 v 0 by employing the linearized gas spring stiffness the equation of motion of the tlcgd system can be expressed as 4 m l y 1 2 ρ a d δ y y 2 ρ a d g y 2 k d

frequency of the damper can be written as follows 5 ω d 2 g l 1 γ p 0 h ρ g to investigate the limitation of the fluid gas interface motion which can be referred to the water air contact surface an insightful study through the fluid dynamics is required ziegler 2008 for this reason a moving contact line with weak viscosity effects in numerical simulations was considered by zunzer and lindner silvester zunzer 2002 lindner silvester 2003 2005 as a result a non dimensional formulation of the navier stokes equations the boundary conditions and the equation of continuity were gained it was shown that there is a lower increment in the dynamic contact angle with respect to the interface speed in the presence of pre wetting of the pipe wall which applies to the low frequency vibrational fluid motion in the case of small capillary ca and reynolds re numbers the flow itself causes a surface tension gradient along the liquid solid interface which has a reverse influence upon the flow and influences the force between the liquid and the solid in the vicinity of the contact line shikhmurzaev 1992 therefore based on the validity of piston theory the frequency should be limited by the relative maximum fluid speed which must remain lower than a critical speed of about 12 m s to avoid cavitation at the fluid gas interface and stop the reverse influence upon the flow lindner silvester 2003 2005 ziegler 2008 in a tlcgd system by using a higher value for the area ratio parameter λ this issue can be restricted due to less liquid displacement in the vertical columns ziegler 2008 in the novel proposed tlcgbd system this limitation overcame by the lower liquid movement which is gained as an advantage of the tlcbd system the governing equation of motion for the structure tlcbd is derived by using the lagrangian formulation as follows 6 d d t t u q i q i t u q i i 1 2 3 where t is the kinetic energy of the entire system including the structure the fluid and the ball u is potential energy of the whole system considering the potential energy of the ball as zero and q 1 q 2 and q 3 are the structure the fluid and the ball displacement respectively finally based on al saif et al 2011 the equation of motion for a sdof system equipped with a tlcbd is expressed as 7 m s m l j b r b 2 x s c s x s k s x s α m l y j b r b 2 x b f t 8 m l y c t y 2 ρ g a y d α m l x s 0 9

is the natural frequency of the systems ξ d is the damping ratio of the tlcbd which is based on the ball diameter can be measured experimentally al saif et al 2011 lastly the equation of motion of the combined tlcbgd damping system can be derived using eqs 4 and 7 to 9 as follows 10 m s m l j b r b 2 x s c s x s k s x s α m l y j b r b 2 x b f t 11 m l y c t y 2 ρ a d g y 2 k d y ρ a d b x s 0 12 m

jacket platform in this manuscript including 2 more degrees of freedom for the liquid and the rolling ball movements more details about the degrees of freedom of the jacket platform are discussed in section 5 3 wave excitation the equation of motion of a system equipped with a tlcbgd system is shown in eq 13 by subjecting the primary system under external excitation such as wave the main structural matrices would include the added mass and damping due to the presence of the primary system in the water added mass or virtual mass which is the result of fluid accelerating around a body is an unavoidable issue in the offshore structure field added mass can be defined as the added inertia to the system to accelerate a body into a fluid it is necessary not only to accelerate the own mass of the body but also its added mass for simplicity added mass can be simulated in a way that the fluid volume moves along the object while all parts of the fluid move with varying degrees ghassemi and yari 2011 by considering the added mass the main structural mass and damping matrices can be expressed as follows dowson 1983 17 m m s ρ w c m 1 v 18 c c s 8 π 0 5 ρ w c d a σ v r where m

respectively in this manuscript the new developed damping system is investigated under both regular ang irregular wave excitation the details of which are discussed in following sections 3 1 regular wave excitation for applying a regular wave force a well understanding of hydrodynamic forces which is the basics of both regular and irregular waves is required main wave parameters should be evaluated based on valid wave theory for this reason a well known morison equation can be employed for calculating the wave forces acting on a member of the structure according to morison s equation the intensity of the wave force per unit of length of the structure members can be evaluated by eq 19 nonlinearly in this study the nonlinear morison equation is supposed linearized utilizing a stochastic linearization technique as eq 20 chakrabarti 2005 19 f w ρ w v c m q n 1 2 ρ w c d a q n x n q n x n 20 f w ρ w v c m q n 1 2 ρ w c d a 8 π σ v r q n x n where q n and q n denote the acceleration and velocity of the fluid normal to member axis at joint n in vertical and horizontal directions respectively x n and q n x n are the absolute velocity and the relative water velocity at joint n calculation of water particle velocity and acceleration in both horizontal and vertical directions is performed by using the stokes second order wave theory in this manuscript in this theory all the characteristics of the wave are defined as a power series in higher orders of the wave steepness h l for engineering applications the second order and possibly the fifth order theories are the most commonly used sorensen 2006 which is considered to be valid in the relative water depth d l of greater than about 0 1 patal 1989 this theory can be specified for describing the waves at any water

and also vertical water particle velocity and acceleration respectively the obtained velocities and accelerations in eqs 21 24 after being transformed from the global coordinates for each member of the offshore structure are used in morison s equation eq 20 to calculate the hydrodynamic load vectors 3 2 irregular wave excitation to represent the actual form of the ocean waves a higher degree of irregularity and randomness is required which is due to the inconsistency in wind speed and direction in the real ocean environment therefore a more realistic capture of the sea surface demands a stochastic consideration of the wave pattern reproducing the wave surface elevation and kinematics of an irregular sea state propagating in the positive x direction requires the superposition of a large number of regular wave components faltinsen 1990 by assuming the wave amplitude η a j discussed in eq 32 wave number k j angular frequency ω w and the phase angle ε j which indicates the characteristics of the wave component number j the surface elevation can be presented as follows 25 η x w t j 1 q η a j cos k j x w ω w t ε j where q is the total number of regular wave components it should be noted that the proposed phase angle can vary uniformly and constantly in a range of 0 2 π this irregular wave simulation is based on the fourier theory in which any signal can be decomposed into a number of individual sine and cosine functions in this manuscript for simulation of wave components of the irregular wave linear wave theory is employed by using the linear theory to calculate wave kinematics the equations for fluid particle velocity and acceleration in horizontal x direction can be given as follows 26 u j k j g η j ω j cosh k j y w d cosh k j d cos k j x w ω w t ε j 27 w j k j g η j cosh k j y w d cosh k j d sin k j x w ω w t ε j the most common wave kinematics calculating method for linear irregular sea is introduced by wheeler 1970 in which a correction needs to be considered to stretch the kinematics calculated at the mean surface y w 0 up to the instantaneous sea surface the corrected vertical coordinate is taken as follows 28 y w y w η y w d d where y w should be replaced in eqs 26 and 27 for wheeler stretching as linear theory is applied the principle of super positioning is valid the contributions of wave kinematics for each wave component is then summed up to form the wave kinematics for the sea surface in time t the velocity and acceleration of the total number of wave components can be expressed as follows 29 u x w y w t j 1 q u j x w y w t 30 w x w y w t j 1 q w j x w y w t based on the regular wave components superposition the frequency characteristics of the irregular sea state become important for fetch limited or coastal wind induced seas it is recommended to implement the jonswap wave spectrum journeé and massie 2001 the jonswap wave spectrum is formulated as follows 31 s η ω 320 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1950 t p 4 ω 4 ϑ exp ω ω p 1 ψ 2 2 where ϑ h s t p ω p and ψ are the peakedness factor significant wave height the peak period top frequency 2 π t p and step function of ω respectively by supposing an equally spaced frequency intervals δω the wave amplitudes η a j of every regular wave component can be related tothe wave spectrum 32 η a j 2 s η ω δ ω two important parameters of the irregular wave with respect to the upcoming description of an irregular sea state must be defined significant wave height which usually stands for the average of the highest third of the measured wave heights and peak period which usually obtains as 95 percent of the mean values of the wave components period the same definitions are considered for obtaining the values of significant wave height and peak wave period parameters in this study an illustrative example is analyzed subsequently in section 5 4 verification procedure for the verification of the present study a previously modeled platform which is investigated by mousavi et al 2012 is employed the platform is modeled as a four leg 5 dof system with the same properties in both x and y directions as illustrated in fig 3 the stiffness mass area and volume

specifications of the platform are considered as mousavi et al 2012 the first three natural frequency of the jacket platform is gained as 5 9 24 5 and 52 7 hz respectively the platform is investigated under two different ground motion accelerations san fernando 1971 and kern county 1952 earthquake scaled to pga 0 3 g as studied by mousavi et al the rms response of the uncontrolled and controlled cases is listed in table 1 for both tlcgd and tlcgbd systems as it is seen in table 1 the differences between the designed tlcgd system of this study and the tlcgd system of mousavi et al is almost 1 5 percent which is in an acceptable range also for a better comparison the response of the jacket platform is investigated by using a new introduced tlcbgd system based on the results the rms response of the top node is decreased more by considering a tlcbgd system the decrement under san fernando and kern country is about 15 and 14 percent more in comparison with the tlcgd system of mousavi et al 2012 5 numerical example passive control of an offshore jacket type platform is investigated using a tlcbgd system under wave loads a three dimensional offshore jacket platform spd9 located in the persian gulf is considered in this regard a figure of the jacket platform model and the real prototype is shown in fig 4 the jacket is modeled based on the four leg prototype structural dimensions with a height of 74 m and the water depth of 69 5 m the weight of the jacket is taken as 15 500 tons and the lowest and the highest levels dimensions are considered as 36 35 and 29 16 meters respectively the finite element fe model is developed by frame3dd software henri and gavin 2010 through 38 structural nodes each with 6 degrees of freedom and 109 elements for the fe model the main mass and stiffness of the jacket platform m s k s are gained as 228 228 matrices for the damping matrix of the jacket platform c s the damping ratio is considered as two percent based on rayleigh s technique as a 228 228 matrix by utilizing the jacket mass and stiffness matrices the matrices of mass and stiffness are also employed for further controlling procedure within matlab the main three natural frequencies of the jacket are gained as 1 83 2 56 3 00 for modeling the regular wave load the specification and details of the persian gulf sea state are used which was gained based on the jonswap spectrum dastan et al 2014 the specifications are utilized to define the water particles velocities and accelerations through stokes second order formulation parameters of the regular wave are taken based on a wave height of 5 83 m which is related to a wave with 100 years of the return period see table 2 for the irregular wave 150 regular wave components are considered in such a way that the peak frequency of the wave is almost the same as the jacket platform frequency more details about the regular and irregular waves are also listed in tables 3 and 4 respectively an illustration of both regular and irregular wave loads are shown in fig 5 passive controlling of a system can be implemented using the first natural frequency of the system in this manuscript the first main natural frequency of the jacket platform is employed for the damping system parameters calculation different head loss coefficient values were taken into account based on the configuration and specification of a system mousavi et al 2012 2013 in this study the head loss coefficient is calculated by using an equation which is introduced by mousavi et al 2012 2013 the mass ratio of the damper δ m a s s m l m s is taken as 1 percent through a parametric study and the effectiveness of the mass ratio parameter on the performance of the damping system is also investigated within the results the whole length of the damper is gained by the fluid mass equation the horizontal length of the damper b is considered as 0 8 of the whole damper liquid length vertical to horizontal columns cross section ratio which is defined as the area ratio is taken as 2 based on previous studies by mousavi et al 2012 2013 the optimized parameters of the tlcgd system are listed in table 5 which are obtained based on the proposed mass ratio the whole parameters of the new tlcbgd damping system are considered the same as the tlcgd parameters to investigate the performance and the efficiency of adding a ball into the system on the other hand the main parameters of a tlcbgd system can be specified as gas pressure values and ball tube ratios r t in which the performance of the tlcbgd system over their changes are investigated for this reason various ball sizes and gas pressures are studied parametrically in this manuscript the performance of the jacket platform with an attached tlcbgd system is compared with the tlcgd system through the results both damping systems are located at the top level of the jacket platform displacement time history of the jacket top node node 4 is shown in fig 6 under regular wave load gas pressure and ball tube ratio are selected as 1 5 bar and 0 4 respectively in fig 6 it is seen that the uncontrolled response of the jacket in fig 6 a is equal to 5 9 cm which is decreased to 3 5 and 2 3 cm by employing the tlcgd system and lower value equals to 2 3 cm using the tlcbgd system the decrement represents 41 and 61 reduction percentages for the tlcgd and tlcbgd systems respectively based on fig 6 b the liquid displacement of both tlcgd and tlcbgd systems are compared lower liquid displacement indicates the high performance of a rolling ball within the liquid on the other hand it can be seen that the utilization of a rolling ball can decrease the liquid fluid displacement significantly which is a requirement for a tlcbgd system this is based on the fact that in higher liquid movement the liquid may enter the trapped gas and reduces the whole system performance the ball and the liquid displacement of the tlcbgd system are illustrated in fig 6 c for more comparison which expressed the opposite movement of the liquid and the rolling ball under regular wave excitation it proves that the rolling ball employment increases the whole system damping due to the ball presence as a movable orifice which moves approximately in opposite directions of the fluid movement it should be noted that the highest reduction in the response of the system occurs as the tlcgd system is taken into account and adding a rolling ball as the new tlcbgd system can improve the capability and efficiency of the damping system up to an acceptable range more details of the displacement response under regular wave loading are listed in table 6 according to table 6 the displacement values of the system under regular wave loading are listed for four structural levels it can be seen that using both damping systems the structural vibration of the system is reduced significantly in all levels although the decrement percentage is high by employing the tlcgd the reduction is higher in top levels by utilization of the tlcbgd system capabilities of the developed system are investigated under wave load by using different gas pressure values and ball tube ratios according to fig 7 the displacement rms of the jacket is shown considering various gas pressure values as the ball tube ratio is considered constant the efficiency of the ball tube ratios is illustrated in fig 8 by using a constant gas pressure value the pressure value is considered as 1 5 bar due to the lowest rms displacement value as shown in fig 8 according to fig 8 the higher the ratio the more the rms of the displacement however the most increment in displacement rms is obtained as the ratio is considered to be more than 0 8 the value of 0 8 was defined as the most efficient value in previous studies al saif et al 2011 the details of the values are depicted in fig 8 b the capability of the proposed tlcgbd damping system is also investigated under different external loading frequencies for this purpose regular wave load with different frequencies in a range of 0 1 4 hz are considered and the normalized frequency response ω e x t ω s of all controlled and uncontrolled systems in which ω e x t is the external force frequency and ω s is the first frequency of the jacket platform are demonstrated in fig 9 the range of external loading frequencies is taken in such a way that all three main natural frequencies of the jacket platform are involved as it can be readily seen in fig 9 the performance of both tlcgd and tlcgd systems are significantly better in whole frequency ranges however the responses are reduced significantly within the resonance region in comparison to the uncontrolled system also it is observed that the response of the uncontrolled system before the resonance region is almost higher than the response of the controlled systems based on fig 9 the performance of both tlcgd and tlcgbd systems are almost the same after resonance region but tlcbgd system caused more reduction in system response which might be caused by the higher movement of the rolling ball in lower frequencies in higher frequencies due to the lower movement of the rolling ball both damping systems perform almost the same the quantitative measure of the new damping system is listed in table 7 the ball tube ratio is taken as 0 4 for the tlcbgd system and the gas pressure is taken as 1 5 bar for both tlcbgd and tlcgd systems according to table 7 among different external loads with various frequencies the highest displacement amplitudes occurs as the excitation load includes the same value of the first natural frequency of the primary structure which causes resonance as the excitation wave frequency is decreased or increased from the resonance value ω e x t ω s 1 the performance of the damping system decreased due to passive performance of the damping system however the presence of the damping system both before and after the resonance frequency improves the overall system performance based on the results of table 7 the tlcbgd model performs better which physically can be explained through the fact that some part of the input energy is transformed to the kinetic energies of the ball and also dissipated as heat through the friction energy between the liquid and the ball to investigate the effectiveness of the mass ratio parameter on the performance of the system a simple parametric study is also implemented based on five different mass ratio values varies from 1 to 5 percent for this purpose both regular and irregular waves are considered in which the value of gas pressure and ball tube ratio are taken as constant values of 1 5 bar and 0 4 respectively the details are listed in table 8 based on table 8 it is clear that by increasing the mass ratio of the tlcgd its efficiency will also increase as it is seen in table 8 by taking higher values of mass ratio into account the displacement rms decreases the lowest displacement rms occurs as the mass ratio is taken 5 percent of the jacket mass however considering a higher mass ratio due to space limitation over the jacket deck is not practical the capability of the proposed model is also studied under irregular wave loading the time history of displacement is illustrated in fig 10 the system response is obtained by taking a gas pressure equal to 1 5 bar and a ball tube ratio of 0 4 into account based on the results of the system under regular wave loading according to fig 10 a the response of the jacket platform is decreased significantly by utilizing the tlcgd and tlcbgd systems the top node displacement value is obtained as 31 19 and 12 cm for the uncontrolled and controlled systems by using the tlcgd and tlcbgd damping systems respectively which indicates almost 37 and 62 percent reduction through the tlcgd and the tlcgbd systems employment more details about the time history response of the system under irregular wave load are listed in table 9 main parameters of the tlcbgd system which are taken as the gas pressure and the ball tube ratio are investigated under irregular wave loading through a parametric study in this regard and as it is discussed previously in regular wave response a constant value is considered for one of the parameters and the second parameter is changed to obtain the optimum value within the selected range the displacement rms response of the system is depicted in fig 11 by considering a constant value of 1 5 bar for the gas pressure and various ball tube ratios the result of displacement rms under the irregular wave is almost the same as the result of the system under regular loading based on the results the lowest displacement rms is obtained as the ball tube ratio is taken equal to 0 4 however through other ball tube ratios no significant increment in displacement rms is observed the displacement rms response of the system is shown in fig 12 by taking a constant value of 0 4 for the ball tube ratio and different gas pressures into account more details about the gas pressure and the ball tube ratio effects are listed in tables 10 and 11 respectively for both regular and irregular waves as it is listed in table 10 the lowest rms values are gained in ball tube ratios of 0 4 and 0 5 which indicate the effects of gas spring existence in the system this is due to the presence of gas pressure which prevents the liquid to move freely a ball with a higher radius also moves slightly difficult through the horizontal column however the effectiveness of ball tube ratio is insignificant in comparison with the efficiency of the gas pressure for the investigated jacket platform lower ball tube ratios result in more efficient structural performance and higher vibrational suppression based on the detailed results of the regular wave in table 11 it is readily seen that as the gas pressure value is increased the system displacement rms increases simultaneously the increment is significant up to 6 bar of gas pressure and then the rms values stay approximately constant as the gas pressure is increased as it is shown in the results of the irregular wave the lowest displacement rms occurs as the gas pressure is taken as 1 5 bar however almost similar lower displacement rms is observed by considering 2 and 4 bar for the gas pressure this phenomenon proves that higher gas pressure values prevent the liquid to flow freely and the fluid movement occurs restrictedly due to high pressures at both ends of vertical columns 6 conclusion in this manuscript passive structural control of a three dimensional offshore jacket platform is performed by using a newly developed tuned liquid column ball gas damper tlcbgd the proposed passive device is a combination of the previously introduced tuned liquid column ball damper tlcbd and the tuned liquid column gas damper tlcgd systems the tlcbgd system is considered to be located at the top level of the jacket platform within the fe modeling a comparative investigation is conducted between the structural response of the system with a tlcgd and the developed new tlcbgd under both regular and irregular wave loading the two main parameters that affect the performance of the tlcbgd assisted structure are studied and their efficient values are gained by using a parametric study furthermore the capability of optimal performances of tlcbgd is studied by applying a set of regular and irregular wave load specifications to the coupled structure tlcbgd system the important parameters that influence the performance of the proposed passive system are the gas pressure values and the ball tube ratio rolling ball size the results indicate that the proposed damping system can improve the vibration suppression performance of the system by decreasing the top level displacement up to 61 and 62 percent under regular and irregular wave loads respectively the effectiveness of the ball size is carried out by proposing various ball sizes with a constant gas pressure value as it is revealed despite the previously identified optimum ball tube ratio 0 8 a value of 0 4 or 0 5 is obtained for this case study which can be explained due to the presence of the gas spring at both ends of the damper vertical columns for the gas pressure value the best performance and the highest vibration mitigation occur as a lower value of gas pressure is taken into account although a tlcgd damping system can be implemented in an offshore structure the utilization of a tlcbgd system is more recommended due to significant reductions in structural vibration of the system in this case study 
22358,structural control of a system can be achieved by employing different control methods the effectiveness of a control technique straightly depends on the performance of the control device among control devices the tuned liquid column gas damper tlcgd has shown high vibration control capabilities in this study a newly developed damping system as a tuned liquid column ball gas damper tlcbgd system is introduced the developed system is a combined version of a tuned liquid column ball damper tlcbd and a tlcgd system the new damper is utilized on an offshore jacket platform and its qualification is studied under both regular and irregular wave incidences the efficiency of the tlcbgd system is investigated numerically by implementing ball tube ratio and gas pressure parameters the effects of the ball tube ratios and the gas pressure values on the vibration suppression capacity of the system are assessed through a parametric study in comparison to a passive tlcgd system the results revealed that the utilizing a tlcbgd system in the jacket platform improves the structural vibration suppression capability keywords passive structural control offshore jacket platform tuned liquid column ball damper gas spring tlcbgd 1 introduction vicious weather conditions can cause different kinds of load impacts on the offshore structures these impacts induce significant vibrations and local and global damage in some circumstances there are several reports related to the structural damage of the floating and the fixed offshore structures after hurricanes van raaji 1996 to improve the whole structural performance some uncertainty reduction methods can be employed based on a requalification process hokmabady et al 2018 hosseinlou and mojtahedi 2016 requalification which can be defined as a structural behavior improvement procedure through small or large modifications might be required because of the structural damage nowadays a high number of installed platforms are reaching the end of their design lifetime requiring a requalification furthermore requalification is not just a cure stage process and its consideration can improve structural reliability this procedure can also be defined through earlier stages in the platform s life span increasing topside weight or operational loads reducing capacity because of damage identification of damage procedures hosseinlou and mojtahedi 2016 mojtahedi et al 2019 and increasing knowledge related to the material behavior or even increasing whole structural vibrational suppression capability through structural control systems and algorithms som and das 2018 structural control devices perform based on vibrational energy absorption capability to keep the primary structure out of serious structural damage the absorption occurs through the energy transfer process from the critical modes of the building to the dynamic damping systems chuan 2008 development of vibration absorber devices has always been the theoretical or the experimental research subjects in the engineering fields due to their high capability in improving reliability and structural performance among these devices tuned liquid column dampers tlcd which consists of a rigid u shaped tube with an orifice in the middle filled with a liquid mostly water has shown to be effective in reducing the structural vibrations coudurier et al 2018 chatterjee and chakraborty 2014 ghosh and basu 2004 colwell and basu 2009 yalla et al 2001 the main limitation of these devices is their best performance in a specific frequency ratio traditional tlcd systems disadvantages even by considering a semi active procedure are significant enough to consider them as inefficient devices colwell and basu 2009 however covering a wide range of external loading excitations can be achieved through employing a hybrid tlcd htlcd a semi active tlcd stlcd considering smart material such as magneto rheological fluids mr tlcd ni et al 2004 wang et al 2005 replacing the linear spring of lcd system with a spring made of shape memory alloy sma lcd gur et al 2014 utilizing a novel mr tlcgd system hokmabady et al 2019 and so forth al saif et al 2011 modified a tlcd by substituting a rolling steel ball with the traditional orifice in the horizontal column of the tlcd and introduced tuned liquid column ball damper tlcbd in a tlcbd system the ball performs as a movable orifice dissipating the liquid column movement energy to improve the damper response reduction capability gur et al 2014 however a modified version of the tlcbd system called the circular liquid column ball damper clcbd was also studied and proposed for controlling torsionally coupled vibration pandey and mishra 2018 although tlcbd system improves the absorber attenuation performance the system limitations are yet existed the limitations of tlcds are also conquered through some ideas such as considering a gas damper called a tuned liquid column gas damper tlcgd hochrainer and ziegler 2006 hochrainer and fotiu 2018 the effects of an air spring gas spring are reflected by a tlcgd damper within the trapped air at the end of vertical columns to tune the damper frequency as of the most important weak point of tlcds basically a tlcgd is too similar to a tlcd system but the main difference arises from its flexibility in frequency regulation which is tuned by adjusting the gas pressure in the vertical columns mousavi et al 2012 2013 the frequency of a tlcgd system can be extended up to 5 hz employing passive gas spring effects a combined novel tlcbgd system mainly increases the system damping and decreases the displacement of the liquid as of the advantages of a tlcbd system and also increases the system stiffness as of the advantage of a tlcgd system however the combined tlcbgd damping system includes advantages of both damping systems it also covers the tlcgd system weakness which is the limitations in damper liquid movement due to the above mentioned concepts and the capability of tlcgd systems in absorbing the system vibration utilizing a rolling ball instead of a fixed orifice within a tlcgd system and considering a novel tlcbgd system would be a suitable choice to increase the system reliability and gathering both ball and gas dampers features within a unit damping system this study evaluates the capability and the effectiveness of a novel developed tlcbgd system under both regular and irregular wave loads on a three dimensional offshore jacket platform the efficiency of the gas pressure values and the ball tube ratios ball size in providing required damping properties and structural vibration reduction capability are investigated simultaneously for the first time in the field of structural control the results indicate the effectiveness of the tlcbgd damping system in decreasing the vibration of the whole system under wave loads results also show that the highest vibration suppression occurs in lower values of gas pressure and almost lower ball tube ratios 2 a tlcbgd system modeling a tlcgbd system consists of a tlcgd and a tlcbd system which can be defined as a tuned liquid column damper with a rolling ball as a moveable orifice in the horizontal column and two gas dampers gas springs in both vertical columns see fig 1 the main equation of motion of the combined tlcbd and tlcgd system requires a precise description of a tlcgd system including a rolling ball a tlcgd system includes a normal liquid such as water in which two trapped air volumes are existed at the end of each vertical column the adjustable air pressure can control the frequency of the damper to increase the whole system efficiency the mechanism of a tlcbgd system can be considered as the simultaneous performance of a tlcbd higher system damping and a tlcgd higher system stiffness system as it is shown in fig 1 y denotes the displacement of the liquid in the vertical columns x is the horizontal displacement of the whole system b shows the horizontal length of the tube ρ represents the liquid density a d is the cross sectional area of the liquid column p 0 is the initial pressure of the gas in the vertical

vertical columns of the system bhattacharyya et al 2017 the stiffness of each gas spring can be driven as follows 1 k d a d d p d y the liquid column oscillation leads to a variation of pressure volume of the closed air columns p v as the system excited by any lateral load the p v relationship can be expressed by the general polytropic relation p v γ c as a constant value in which γ is the index of polytropic the gas spring acts under isothermal conditions γ 1 in slower velocities while in high frequencies an adiabatic change occurs and the index value changes to γ 1 4 in any other circumstances γ takes a value in a range between 1 and 1 4 mousavi et al 2013 by utilization of p 0 v 0 p v γ at a time instant and replacing p and also proposing v v 0 a y or d v d y a d eq 1 can be rewritten as 2 k d γ a d 2 p 0 v 0 1 a y v 0 γ 1 based on eq 2 the gas spring stiffness is nonlinear and for small liquid displacement y t the linearized air spring stiffness can be given as bhattacharyya et al 2017 3 k d γ a d 2 p 0 v 0 by employing the linearized gas spring stiffness the equation of motion of the tlcgd system can be expressed as 4 m l y 1 2 ρ a d δ y y 2 ρ a d g y 2 k d

displacement velocity and acceleration respectively δ g ρ and x are head loss coefficient gravitational acceleration liquid density and container horizontal displacement respectively the natural frequency of the damper can be written as follows 5 ω d 2 g l 1 γ p 0 h ρ g to investigate the limitation of the fluid gas interface motion which can be referred to the water air contact surface an insightful study through the fluid dynamics is required ziegler 2008 for this reason a moving contact line with weak viscosity effects in numerical simulations was considered by zunzer and lindner silvester zunzer 2002 lindner silvester 2003 2005 as a result a non dimensional formulation of the navier stokes equations the boundary conditions and the equation of continuity were gained it was shown that there is a lower increment in the dynamic contact angle with respect to the interface speed in the presence of pre wetting of the pipe wall which applies to the low frequency vibrational fluid motion in the case of small capillary ca and reynolds re numbers the flow itself causes a surface tension gradient along the liquid solid interface which has a reverse influence upon the flow and influences the force between the liquid and the solid in the vicinity of the contact line shikhmurzaev 1992 therefore based on the validity of piston theory the frequency should be limited by the relative maximum fluid speed which must remain lower than a critical speed of about 12 m s to avoid cavitation at the fluid gas interface and stop the reverse influence upon the flow lindner silvester 2003 2005 ziegler 2008 in a tlcgd system by using a higher value for the area ratio parameter λ this issue can be restricted due to less liquid displacement in the vertical columns ziegler 2008 in the novel proposed tlcgbd system this limitation overcame by the lower liquid movement which is gained as an advantage of the tlcbd system the governing equation of motion for the structure tlcbd is derived by using the lagrangian formulation as follows 6 d d t t u q i q i t u q i i 1 2 3 where t is the kinetic energy of the entire system including the structure the fluid and the ball u is potential energy of the whole system considering the potential energy of the ball as zero and q 1 q 2 and q 3 are the structure the fluid and the ball displacement respectively finally based on al saif et al 2011 the equation of motion for a sdof system equipped with a tlcbd is expressed as 7 m s m l j b r b 2 x s c s x s k s x s α m l y j b r b 2 x b f t 8 m l y c t y 2 ρ g a y d α m l x s 0 9

is the natural frequency of the systems ξ d is the damping ratio of the tlcbd which is based on the ball diameter can be measured experimentally al saif et al 2011 lastly the equation of motion of the combined tlcbgd damping system can be derived using eqs 4 and 7 to 9 as follows 10 m s m l j b r b 2 x s c s x s k s x s α m l y j b r b 2 x b f t 11 m l y c t y 2 ρ a d g y 2 k d y ρ a d b x s 0 12 m

jacket platform in this manuscript including 2 more degrees of freedom for the liquid and the rolling ball movements more details about the degrees of freedom of the jacket platform are discussed in section 5 3 wave excitation the equation of motion of a system equipped with a tlcbgd system is shown in eq 13 by subjecting the primary system under external excitation such as wave the main structural matrices would include the added mass and damping due to the presence of the primary system in the water added mass or virtual mass which is the result of fluid accelerating around a body is an unavoidable issue in the offshore structure field added mass can be defined as the added inertia to the system to accelerate a body into a fluid it is necessary not only to accelerate the own mass of the body but also its added mass for simplicity added mass can be simulated in a way that the fluid volume moves along the object while all parts of the fluid move with varying degrees ghassemi and yari 2011 by considering the added mass the main structural mass and damping matrices can be expressed as follows dowson 1983 17 m m s ρ w c m 1 v 18 c c s 8 π 0 5 ρ w c d a σ v r where m

respectively in this manuscript the new developed damping system is investigated under both regular ang irregular wave excitation the details of which are discussed in following sections 3 1 regular wave excitation for applying a regular wave force a well understanding of hydrodynamic forces which is the basics of both regular and irregular waves is required main wave parameters should be evaluated based on valid wave theory for this reason a well known morison equation can be employed for calculating the wave forces acting on a member of the structure according to morison s equation the intensity of the wave force per unit of length of the structure members can be evaluated by eq 19 nonlinearly in this study the nonlinear morison equation is supposed linearized utilizing a stochastic linearization technique as eq 20 chakrabarti 2005 19 f w ρ w v c m q n 1 2 ρ w c d a q n x n q n x n 20 f w ρ w v c m q n 1 2 ρ w c d a 8 π σ v r q n x n where q n and q n denote the acceleration and velocity of the fluid normal to member axis at joint n in vertical and horizontal directions respectively x n and q n x n are the absolute velocity and the relative water velocity at joint n calculation of water particle velocity and acceleration in both horizontal and vertical directions is performed by using the stokes second order wave theory in this manuscript in this theory all the characteristics of the wave are defined as a power series in higher orders of the wave steepness h l for engineering applications the second order and possibly the fifth order theories are the most commonly used sorensen 2006 which is considered to be valid in the relative water depth d l of greater than about 0 1 patal 1989 this theory can be specified for describing the waves at any water

frequency and the water depth respectively x w and y w are the coordinate system components based on a fixed reference see fig 2 u u w and w are the horizontal water particle velocity and acceleration and also vertical water particle velocity and acceleration respectively the obtained velocities and accelerations in eqs 21 24 after being transformed from the global coordinates for each member of the offshore structure are used in morison s equation eq 20 to calculate the hydrodynamic load vectors 3 2 irregular wave excitation to represent the actual form of the ocean waves a higher degree of irregularity and randomness is required which is due to the inconsistency in wind speed and direction in the real ocean environment therefore a more realistic capture of the sea surface demands a stochastic consideration of the wave pattern reproducing the wave surface elevation and kinematics of an irregular sea state propagating in the positive x direction requires the superposition of a large number of regular wave components faltinsen 1990 by assuming the wave amplitude η a j discussed in eq 32 wave number k j angular frequency ω w and the phase angle ε j which indicates the characteristics of the wave component number j the surface elevation can be presented as follows 25 η x w t j 1 q η a j cos k j x w ω w t ε j where q is the total number of regular wave components it should be noted that the proposed phase angle can vary uniformly and constantly in a range of 0 2 π this irregular wave simulation is based on the fourier theory in which any signal can be decomposed into a number of individual sine and cosine functions in this manuscript for simulation of wave components of the irregular wave linear wave theory is employed by using the linear theory to calculate wave kinematics the equations for fluid particle velocity and acceleration in horizontal x direction can be given as follows 26 u j k j g η j ω j cosh k j y w d cosh k j d cos k j x w ω w t ε j 27 w j k j g η j cosh k j y w d cosh k j d sin k j x w ω w t ε j the most common wave kinematics calculating method for linear irregular sea is introduced by wheeler 1970 in which a correction needs to be considered to stretch the kinematics calculated at the mean surface y w 0 up to the instantaneous sea surface the corrected vertical coordinate is taken as follows 28 y w y w η y w d d where y w should be replaced in eqs 26 and 27 for wheeler stretching as linear theory is applied the principle of super positioning is valid the contributions of wave kinematics for each wave component is then summed up to form the wave kinematics for the sea surface in time t the velocity and acceleration of the total number of wave components can be expressed as follows 29 u x w y w t j 1 q u j x w y w t 30 w x w y w t j 1 q w j x w y w t based on the regular wave components superposition the frequency characteristics of the irregular sea state become important for fetch limited or coastal wind induced seas it is recommended to implement the jonswap wave spectrum journeé and massie 2001 the jonswap wave spectrum is formulated as follows 31 s η ω 320 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1950 t p 4 ω 4 ϑ exp ω

frequency intervals δω the wave amplitudes η a j of every regular wave component can be related tothe wave spectrum 32 η a j 2 s η ω δ ω two important parameters of the irregular wave with respect to the upcoming description of an irregular sea state must be defined significant wave height which usually stands for the average of the highest third of the measured wave heights and peak period which usually obtains as 95 percent of the mean values of the wave components period the same definitions are considered for obtaining the values of significant wave height and peak wave period parameters in this study an illustrative example is analyzed subsequently in section 5 4 verification procedure for the verification of the present study a previously modeled platform which is investigated by mousavi et al 2012 is employed the platform is modeled as a four leg 5 dof system with the same properties in both x and y directions as illustrated in fig 3 the stiffness mass area and volume

specifications of the platform are considered as mousavi et al 2012 the first three natural frequency of the jacket platform is gained as 5 9 24 5 and 52 7 hz respectively the platform is investigated under two different ground motion accelerations san fernando 1971 and kern county 1952 earthquake scaled to pga 0 3 g as studied by mousavi et al the rms response of the uncontrolled and controlled cases is listed in table 1 for both tlcgd and tlcgbd systems as it is seen in table 1 the differences between the designed tlcgd system of this study and the tlcgd system of mousavi et al is almost 1 5 percent which is in an acceptable range also for a better comparison the response of the jacket platform is investigated by using a new introduced tlcbgd system based on the results the rms response of the top node is decreased more by considering a tlcbgd system the decrement under san fernando and kern country is about 15 and 14 percent more in comparison with the tlcgd system of mousavi et al 2012 5 numerical example passive control of an offshore jacket type platform is investigated using a tlcbgd system under wave loads a three dimensional offshore jacket platform spd9 located in the persian gulf is considered in this regard a figure of the jacket platform model and the real prototype is shown in fig 4 the jacket is modeled based on the four leg prototype structural dimensions with a height of 74 m and the water depth of 69 5 m the weight of the jacket is taken as 15 500 tons and the lowest and the highest levels dimensions are considered as 36 35 and 29 16 meters respectively the finite element fe model is developed by frame3dd software henri and gavin 2010 through 38 structural nodes each with 6 degrees of freedom and 109 elements for the fe model the main mass and stiffness of the jacket platform m s k s are gained as 228 228 matrices for the damping matrix of the jacket platform c s the damping ratio is considered as two percent based on rayleigh s technique as a 228 228 matrix by utilizing the jacket mass and stiffness matrices the matrices of mass and stiffness are also employed for further controlling procedure within matlab the main three natural frequencies of the jacket are gained as 1 83 2 56 3 00 for modeling the regular wave load the specification and details of the persian gulf sea state are used which was gained based on the jonswap spectrum dastan et al 2014 the specifications are utilized to define the water particles velocities and accelerations through stokes second order formulation parameters of the regular wave are taken based on a wave height of 5 83 m which is related to a wave with 100 years of the return period see table 2 for the irregular wave 150 regular wave components are considered in such a way that the peak frequency of the wave is almost the same as the jacket platform frequency more details about the regular and irregular waves are also listed in tables 3 and 4 respectively an illustration of both regular and irregular wave loads are shown in fig 5 passive controlling of a system can be implemented using the first natural frequency of the system in this manuscript the first main natural frequency of the jacket platform is employed for the damping system parameters calculation different head loss coefficient values were taken into account based on the configuration and specification of a system mousavi et al 2012 2013 in this study the head loss coefficient is calculated by using an equation which is introduced by mousavi et al 2012 2013 the mass ratio of the damper δ m a s s m l m s is taken as 1 percent through a parametric study and the effectiveness of the mass ratio parameter on the performance of the damping system is also investigated within the results the whole length of the damper is gained by the fluid mass equation the horizontal length of the damper b is considered as 0 8 of the whole damper liquid length vertical to horizontal columns cross section ratio which is defined as the area ratio is taken as 2 based on previous studies by mousavi et al 2012 2013 the optimized parameters of the tlcgd system are listed in table 5 which are obtained based on the proposed mass ratio the whole parameters of the new tlcbgd damping system are considered the same as the tlcgd parameters to investigate the performance and the efficiency of adding a ball into the system on the other hand the main parameters of a tlcbgd system can be specified as gas pressure values and ball tube ratios r t in which the performance of the tlcbgd system over their changes are investigated for this reason various ball sizes and gas pressures are studied parametrically in this manuscript the performance of the jacket platform with an attached tlcbgd system is compared with the tlcgd system through the results both damping systems are located at the top level of the jacket platform displacement time history of the jacket top node node 4 is shown in fig 6 under regular wave load gas pressure and ball tube ratio are selected as 1 5 bar and 0 4 respectively in fig 6 it is seen that the uncontrolled response of the jacket in fig 6 a is equal to 5 9 cm which is decreased to 3 5 and 2 3 cm by employing the tlcgd system and lower value equals to 2 3 cm using the tlcbgd system the decrement represents 41 and 61 reduction percentages for the tlcgd and tlcbgd systems respectively based on fig 6 b the liquid displacement of both tlcgd and tlcbgd systems are compared lower liquid displacement indicates the high performance of a rolling ball within the liquid on the other hand it can be seen that the utilization of a rolling ball can decrease the liquid fluid displacement significantly which is a requirement for a tlcbgd system this is based on the fact that in higher liquid movement the liquid may enter the trapped gas and reduces the whole system performance the ball and the liquid displacement of the tlcbgd system are illustrated in fig 6 c for more comparison which expressed the opposite movement of the liquid and the rolling ball under regular wave excitation it proves that the rolling ball employment increases the whole system damping due to the ball presence as a movable orifice which moves approximately in opposite directions of the fluid movement it should be noted that the highest reduction in the response of the system occurs as the tlcgd system is taken into account and adding a rolling ball as the new tlcbgd system can improve the capability and efficiency of the damping system up to an acceptable range more details of the displacement response under regular wave loading are listed in table 6 according to table 6 the displacement values of the system under regular wave loading are listed for four structural levels it can be seen that using both damping systems the structural vibration of the system is reduced significantly in all levels although the decrement percentage is high by employing the tlcgd the reduction is higher in top levels by utilization of the tlcbgd system capabilities of the developed system are investigated under wave load by using different gas pressure values and ball tube ratios according to fig 7 the displacement rms of the jacket is shown considering various gas pressure values as the ball tube ratio is considered constant the efficiency of the ball tube ratios is illustrated in fig 8 by using a constant gas pressure value the pressure value is considered as 1 5 bar due to the lowest rms displacement value as shown in fig 8 according to fig 8 the higher the ratio the more the rms of the displacement however the most increment in displacement rms is obtained as the ratio is considered to be more than 0 8 the value of 0 8 was defined as the most efficient value in previous studies al saif et al 2011 the details of the values are depicted in fig 8 b the capability of the proposed tlcgbd damping system is also investigated under different external loading frequencies for this purpose regular wave load with different frequencies in a range of 0 1 4 hz are considered and the normalized frequency response ω e x t ω s of all controlled and uncontrolled systems in which ω e x t is the external force frequency and ω s is the first frequency of the jacket platform are demonstrated in fig 9 the range of external loading frequencies is taken in such a way that all three main natural frequencies of the jacket platform are involved as it can be readily seen in fig 9 the performance of both tlcgd and tlcgd systems are significantly better in whole frequency ranges however the responses are reduced significantly within the resonance region in comparison to the uncontrolled system also it is observed that the response of the uncontrolled system before the resonance region is almost higher than the response of the controlled systems based on fig 9 the performance of both tlcgd and tlcgbd systems are almost the same after resonance region but tlcbgd system caused more reduction in system response which might be caused by the higher movement of the rolling ball in lower frequencies in higher frequencies due to the lower movement of the rolling ball both damping systems perform almost the same the quantitative measure of the new damping system is listed in table 7 the ball tube ratio is taken as 0 4 for the tlcbgd system and the gas pressure is taken as 1 5 bar for both tlcbgd and tlcgd systems according to table 7 among different external loads with various frequencies the highest displacement amplitudes occurs as the excitation load includes the same value of the first natural frequency of the primary structure which causes resonance as the excitation wave frequency is decreased or increased from the resonance value ω e x t ω s 1 the performance of the damping system decreased due to passive performance of the damping system however the presence of the damping system both before and after the resonance frequency improves the overall system performance based on the results of table 7 the tlcbgd model performs better which physically can be explained through the fact that some part of the input energy is transformed to the kinetic energies of the ball and also dissipated as heat through the friction energy between the liquid and the ball to investigate the effectiveness of the mass ratio parameter on the performance of the system a simple parametric study is also implemented based on five different mass ratio values varies from 1 to 5 percent for this purpose both regular and irregular waves are considered in which the value of gas pressure and ball tube ratio are taken as constant values of 1 5 bar and 0 4 respectively the details are listed in table 8 based on table 8 it is clear that by increasing the mass ratio of the tlcgd its efficiency will also increase as it is seen in table 8 by taking higher values of mass ratio into account the displacement rms decreases the lowest displacement rms occurs as the mass ratio is taken 5 percent of the jacket mass however considering a higher mass ratio due to space limitation over the jacket deck is not practical the capability of the proposed model is also studied under irregular wave loading the time history of displacement is illustrated in fig 10 the system response is obtained by taking a gas pressure equal to 1 5 bar and a ball tube ratio of 0 4 into account based on the results of the system under regular wave loading according to fig 10 a the response of the jacket platform is decreased significantly by utilizing the tlcgd and tlcbgd systems the top node displacement value is obtained as 31 19 and 12 cm for the uncontrolled and controlled systems by using the tlcgd and tlcbgd damping systems respectively which indicates almost 37 and 62 percent reduction through the tlcgd and the tlcgbd systems employment more details about the time history response of the system under irregular wave load are listed in table 9 main parameters of the tlcbgd system which are taken as the gas pressure and the ball tube ratio are investigated under irregular wave loading through a parametric study in this regard and as it is discussed previously in regular wave response a constant value is considered for one of the parameters and the second parameter is changed to obtain the optimum value within the selected range the displacement rms response of the system is depicted in fig 11 by considering a constant value of 1 5 bar for the gas pressure and various ball tube ratios the result of displacement rms under the irregular wave is almost the same as the result of the system under regular loading based on the results the lowest displacement rms is obtained as the ball tube ratio is taken equal to 0 4 however through other ball tube ratios no significant increment in displacement rms is observed the displacement rms response of the system is shown in fig 12 by taking a constant value of 0 4 for the ball tube ratio and different gas pressures into account more details about the gas pressure and the ball tube ratio effects are listed in tables 10 and 11 respectively for both regular and irregular waves as it is listed in table 10 the lowest rms values are gained in ball tube ratios of 0 4 and 0 5 which indicate the effects of gas spring existence in the system this is due to the presence of gas pressure which prevents the liquid to move freely a ball with a higher radius also moves slightly difficult through the horizontal column however the effectiveness of ball tube ratio is insignificant in comparison with the efficiency of the gas pressure for the investigated jacket platform lower ball tube ratios result in more efficient structural performance and higher vibrational suppression based on the detailed results of the regular wave in table 11 it is readily seen that as the gas pressure value is increased the system displacement rms increases simultaneously the increment is significant up to 6 bar of gas pressure and then the rms values stay approximately constant as the gas pressure is increased as it is shown in the results of the irregular wave the lowest displacement rms occurs as the gas pressure is taken as 1 5 bar however almost similar lower displacement rms is observed by considering 2 and 4 bar for the gas pressure this phenomenon proves that higher gas pressure values prevent the liquid to flow freely and the fluid movement occurs restrictedly due to high pressures at both ends of vertical columns 6 conclusion in this manuscript passive structural control of a three dimensional offshore jacket platform is performed by using a newly developed tuned liquid column ball gas damper tlcbgd the proposed passive device is a combination of the previously introduced tuned liquid column ball damper tlcbd and the tuned liquid column gas damper tlcgd systems the tlcbgd system is considered to be located at the top level of the jacket platform within the fe modeling a comparative investigation is conducted between the structural response of the system with a tlcgd and the developed new tlcbgd under both regular and irregular wave loading the two main parameters that affect the performance of the tlcbgd assisted structure are studied and their efficient values are gained by using a parametric study furthermore the capability of optimal performances of tlcbgd is studied by applying a set of regular and irregular wave load specifications to the coupled structure tlcbgd system the important parameters that influence the performance of the proposed passive system are the gas pressure values and the ball tube ratio rolling ball size the results indicate that the proposed damping system can improve the vibration suppression performance of the system by decreasing the top level displacement up to 61 and 62 percent under regular and irregular wave loads respectively the effectiveness of the ball size is carried out by proposing various ball sizes with a constant gas pressure value as it is revealed despite the previously identified optimum ball tube ratio 0 8 a value of 0 4 or 0 5 is obtained for this case study which can be explained due to the presence of the gas spring at both ends of the damper vertical columns for the gas pressure value the best performance and the highest vibration mitigation occur as a lower value of gas pressure is taken into account although a tlcgd damping system can be implemented in an offshore structure the utilization of a tlcbgd system is more recommended due to significant reductions in structural vibration of the system in this case study

turbulent flow 1 introduction the hydrodynamic characteristics of pitching hydrofoil can provide worthwhile information to understand behaviors of underwater vehicles the most important factor in design of these vehicles is to achieve maximum velocity and simultaneously minimizing wasted energy this target can be achieved by using some approaches to decrease drag and also increase thrust force the dynamic stall causes a hysteresis loop behavior of the force and moment on the hydrofoil which can lead to break in the hydrofoil therefore the dynamic stall can restrict the performance of

dimensional steady potential flow with linearized free surface condition and thin foil approximation was used hough and moran 1969 plotkin 1975 however the linearized free surface condition could not predict the free surface effects accurately therefore nonlinear free surface models were used kennell and plotkin 1984 derived the nonlinear second order effects of the free surface for thin

preserved at the free surface of the fluid and the no slip boundary conditions used on the hydrofoil bai and han 1994 used the finite element method to capture the nonlinear steady waves of the free surface that created by the flow around a hydrofoil duncan 1983 performed experiments on the naca0012 hydrofoil to obtain free surface wave elevation and the breaking and non breaking wave resistance for different depth of submergence angle of attack and velocity karim et al 2014 used the fluent software to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for the turbulent flow around the naca0015 hydrofoil in a static configuration in order to simulate the free surface effects and turbulent flow they have used the volume of fluid vof method and the realizable k ε model respectively in a similar way the flow around the naca 0012 hydrofoil was investigated by prasad et al 2015 by openfoam software they have used the vof method and the standard k ε turbulence model to capture the free

for modeling the dynamic stall of airfoils or hydrofoils it is common to investigate an oscillating pitching or heaving ones as aforementioned before the dynamic stall has significant effect on the aerodynamic performance of airfoils or hydrofoils therefore in addition to stationary hydrofoil some researchers have studied the oscillating hydrofoils chung 2016 has investigated the propulsive

have placed the hydrofoil at depth where the free surface has no effect in another work the effect of flexibility on lift enhancement of plunging plate at a large distance from the free surface was studied experimentally by cleaver et al 2016 de silva et al de silva and yamaguchi 2012 investigated energy extraction from gravitational wave by oscillating hydrofoil in the vicinity of the water free surface esmaeilifar et al 2017 simulated plunging hydrofoil near the water free surface for different submergence depth and oscillation frequency although the effects of the pitching motion on the lift and drag coefficients of airfoils are investigated extensively favier et al 1988 ko and mccroskey 1997 martin et al 1974 wang et al 2010 the pitching of hydrofoil near the water free surface are not studied yet the dynamic stall occurs in pitching airfoils during its down ward motion when an airfoil is rotating in upward direction the vortex shedding and therefore the stall is delayed and lead to a higher maximum lift coefficient when the airfoil begins the downward rotation the vortex is rapidly shed from the upper surface of airfoil resulting huge drop in the lift coefficient and increase in the drag coefficient wernert wernert et al 1996 and leishman 1990 presented that during the down stroke phase of the pitching cycle a secondary vortex is usually observed which indicated

airfoil the k ω sst shear stress transport model was used for modeling of turbulent flow guillaud et al 2018 simulated a pitching naca0012 airfoil at turbulent flow by the large eddy simulations les model in this work the effect of the reduced frequency on the dynamic stall behavior of airfoil was investigated in a similar study negi et al 2018 investigated the flow around an airfoil with small

considerably this paper presents numerical simulations of the unsteady turbulent flow around a pitching hydrofoil near the water free surface the free surface profile is captured by vof method and the turbulent features of flow is modeled by k w sst model the effects of submergence depth ratio and pitching frequency on the lift and drag coefficients are examined 2 problem description and governing equations a submerged pitching naca0012 hydrofoil is investigated in this paper the physical model is shown in fig 1 where c α and d indicate the chord length angle of attack aoa and distance from the water free surface respectively the pitching motion of the hydrofoil is defined by a sinusoidal angular motion with the axis of rotation is located at 0 25c from the leading edge of the hydrofoil therefore the angle of attack of the airfoil is varied as 1 α α 0 a 1 sin 2 π f t where α0 and α1 and f denote the mean aoa pitch amplitude and oscillation frequency respectively as can be seen the distance between the hydrofoil and inlet and outlet boundaries are 15c and 30c also the distance between the top and bottoms boundaries are 30c where the hydrofoil is located at the center on this length the uniform free stream passes through the hydrofoil with the velocity magnitude of u in the x direction furthermore the reduced frequency k of the oscillating hydrofoil and froude number are defined as 2 k π f c u 3 f r u g c where g is the gravitational acceleration in this research the physics of flow is studied numerically continuity and momentum equations are as follows 4 u x v y 0 5

nature of flow this turbulence model employs the k ω model near the surface and the k ε model in free shear layers the k ω s s t model can predict the onset and the amount of flow separation under adverse pressure gradient accurately menter 1994 therefore this model is frequently adopted in the numerical simulation of flow around blunt bodies for modeling the two phase flow and capturing the free surface wave generated by the submerged hydrofoil the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 is used the vof model can simulate two immiscible fluids by tracking the volume fraction ϕ of one of the fluids across the domain by the solution of a species equation for ϕ in the following form 7 d ϕ d t ϕ t v ϕ 0 if the volume fraction of qth fluid in a cell is presented by ϕ q then the following situations are possible ϕ q 0 the cell does not contain the qth fluid ϕ q 1 the cell contains only the qth fluid 0 ϕ q 1 the cell contains the interface 3 validation of numerical method in the first validation test case the lift and the drag coefficients of a pitching airfoil are compared with experimental data of lee and gerontakos 2004 and numerical results given by gharali and johnson 2013 in this test case the airfoil oscillates in the air with the sinusoidal function of α 10 15 sin 18 67 t and the reduced frequency of k 0 1 the chord length the free stream velocity and the reynolds number are c 0 15m u 14 m s and r e 1 35 10 5 respectively the computed lift coefficient for first five cycles of the pitching airfoil is presented in fig 2 and it shows that after the second pitching cycle the aerodynamic force loops become periodic in fig 3 a and fig 3b the calculated lift and drag coefficients are compared with experimental data of lee and gerontakos 2004 and numerical data of gharali and johnson 2013 at the up stroke motion of airfoil both numerical results are in good agreement with experimental results however at the down stroke motion the current lift and drag are closer to the experimental data than that of gharali and johnson 2013 the average of discrepancy between our results and experimental results for the lift and drag coefficients are 5 3 and 10 2 respectively these values for gharali and johnson simulation are 7 4 and 10 3 respectively in the second validation test case the results obtained by the vof method for simulation of submerged stationary naca0012 hydrofoil is compared with experimental test of duncan 1983 in this test case the flow velocity is 0 8 m s and the chord length is 0 2m which lead to the froude number of f r 0 5711 and reynolds number of re 1 592 10 5 in fig 4 the present prediction of wave profiles is compared with the duncan s experimental result and numerical results of karim et al 2014 as can be seen the current prediction of wave profile is in a good agreement to experimental data the obtained shape of the free surface is shown in fig 5 4 results and discussion in this study the pressure inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions are applied at inlet and outlet boundaries respectively at hydrofoil surface the wall boundary condition is used and the symmetric boundary condition is applied for both top and bottom boundaries the simplec algorithm is employed for pressure velocity coupling of navier stokes equations the body force weighted scheme is utilized for discretization of pressure also the second order upwind scheme is used for discretization of momentum turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate the compressive scheme is applied for discretization of volume fraction the independence of results from the mesh is studied in both static and dynamic configuration of hydrofoil two different high quality structured meshes with 207500 and 356000 cell numbers are generated the mesh sizes on the hydrofoil is refined so that the y on the hydrofoil become lower than one and at least 15 nodes placed in the boundary layer the comparisons of the lift and drag coefficients between two meshes for pitching hydrofoil at h c 1 0 and k 1 0 are shown in fig 6 as can be seen there is a good agreement between the results of both meshes the obtained results from both mesh in static configuration are also approximately close to each other therefore for pitching hydrofoil simulations the coarser mesh was used the close up view of this grid is shown in fig 7 in all simulations of this paper except those otherwise explicitly stated the chord length the free stream velocity and the froude number are 0 15m 1 4 m s and 1 154 respectively for the residuals of all field variables the value of 1e 6 were adopted as the convergence criteria and a sample of iteration history for k 1 0 and h c 1 0 is displayed in fig 8 shapes of the free surface during one period of hydrofoil oscillation for k 1 0 and h c 1 0 are shown in fig 9 the time interval between two successive plots are t 8 unlike the stationary hydrofoil the free surface shape of oscillating hydrofoil is an unsteady wave behind the hydrofoil the elevation of the wave crest increases to a critical height after that the wave is broken due to the gravity moreover the free surface waves are gradually disappeared behind the hydrofoil after 15 times of the chord length shape of the free surface for h c 5 0 are shown in fig 10 as can be seen the amplitude of the wave profiles is negligible therefore the influence of hydrofoil and its oscillation on the free surface shape are completely vanished for values of h c greater than 5 the contour of velocity magnitude around the hydrofoil at different times of one period is displayed in fig 11 for h c 1 0 and k 1 0 the time lag between two consecutive contours is t 4 it is found from the figure that below the crest and the above the trough are the low velocity regions and below the trough is the high velocity region the vorticity contours around the hydrofoil at different angles of attack for k 0 1 and h c 1 0 are shown in fig 12 as can be observed there are two high vorticity regions in the flow domain the hydrofoil surface and above the trough of the wave the high vorticity above the trough is due to the wave break of the free surface when the wave is broken the water of the wave apex goes to the downward direction and hit to the wave trough and cause to increasing in the vorticity value at low angles of attach the boundary layer is attached to the airfoil later a leading edge vortex lev forms in the up stroke phase at aoa of 22 69 and creates a low pressure region over the hydrofoil at the leading edge moreover a trailing edge vortex tev with oppose direction of lev is formed at aoa of 23 92 and finally sheds to downstream by increasing the aoa the lev growths and travels toward the trailing edge this leads to a low pressure region coats the upper surface of the airfoil therefore a sudden rise in the hydrodynamic forces is occurred at aoa equal to 24 6 a vortex with reverse direction of lev is created on the upper surface and near the leading edge subsequently this vortex becomes larger and separates the lev from the upper surface therefore the strength of lev decreases and leads to a sudden drop in the lift coefficient the vorticity contours around the hydrofoil at different angles of attack for k 1 0 and h c 1 0 are shown in fig 13 the pattern of vortices in this reduced frequency is completely different from those pattern in k 0 1 despite to the k 0 1 at k 1 0 on the upper surface only the vortex with negative vorticity is created and the vortex with positive vorticity is created at lower surface of the airfoil as can be seen the lev is created at aoa equal to 20 32 in down stroke phase this vortex growths and move to the trailing edge of the airfoil and remains on the upper surface during entire of down stroke phase of airfoil oscillating during down stroke phase with negative aoa the strength of lev is reduced and completely removed in up stroke phase of airfoil s motion in fig 14 the effects of reduced frequency on the lift coefficients at h c 1 0 are shown for better comparison the values of reduced frequency smaller than 1 0 is shown in fig 14a and the values of reduced frequency larger than 1 0 and k 0 1 is shown in fig 14b as it can be seen in fig 14a for values of k 0 1 a sudden drop is occurred in aoa 24 6 as described in fig 10 this abrupt reduction in lift coefficient is caused by a vortex with positive vorticity that is created at aoa 24 6 on the upper surface and near the leading edge in these sudden drops the lift coefficient are reduced from 2 09 to 0 61 for k 0 1 and from 2 09 to 0 84 for k 0 067 for k 0 25 also a sudden drop of lift coefficient is occurred at aoa 25 however the change of lift coefficient during this sudden drop is relatively small and it reduced from 1 92 to 1 69 after this sudden reduction the lift coefficient remain constant until to aoa 19 and then it gradually reduced to 0 035 at aoa 11 35 the reason of this phenomenon is that at this value of k the positive vortex on the upper surface has not sufficient strength to push the negative vortex lev away from the upper surface of hydrofoil therefore this positive vortex reduces the lift coefficient slightly and then vanishes from the upper surface after disappearing of this positive vortex the lev with negative vorticity remains on the upper surface until aoa 19 as described in fig 11 for values of k greater than 0 5 on the upper surface of hydrofoil only a vortex with negative vorticity is created and vortex with positive vorticity is created only on the lower surface of hydrofoil therefore a sudden drop in the lift coefficient is not occurred at aoa 25 and the lift coefficient is reduces gradually during down stroke phase of hydrofoil oscillation however by increasing the frequency of rotation the variation of the lift coefficient during one period of rotation is increased considerably the maximum value of the lift coefficient for k 1 0 k 2 0 and k 4 0 are equal to 1 5 4 and 13 where happened at aoa 17 aoa 8 and aoa 4 at frequencies larger than k 1 0 the lift coefficient versus the aoa have oval shapes in fig 15 the effects of reduced frequency on the drag coefficients at h c 1 0 are shown for better comparison the values of reduced frequency smaller than 1 0 is shown in fig 15a and the values of reduced frequency larger than 1 0 and k 0 1 is shown in fig 15b similar to the lift coefficient near the aoa 25 a sudden drop in the drag coefficient are occurred for values of k smaller than 0 25 in the higher values of k there are not a sudden drop at aoa 25 the curve of the drag coefficient versus the aoa has two closed loops where connected to each other at aoa 0 approximately the small loop locates between aoa 5 to aoa 0 and the bigger loop locates between aoa 0 to aoa 25 for small values of rotation frequency k 0 25 k 0 5 the changes of the drag coefficient at different values of aoa is small for k 1 0 k 2 0 and k 4 0 the maximum of drag coefficient are 0 52 0 93 and 2 4 where happened at aoa 19 5 aoa 15 7 and aoa 13 5 the changes of lift coefficients for different values of depth ratio h c in a fixed value of frequency ratio k 1 are shown in fig 16 the maximum value of the lift coefficient is increased by increasing the depth ratio from h c 1 0 to h c 4 0 and then decreased by increasing of depth ratio the variations of the drag coefficients at k 1 and different values of depth ratio h c are presented in fig 17 it can be concluded that by decreasing the submerge depth ratio of hydrofoil the drag coefficient is increased moreover for all submerged depth ratio the maximum drag coefficient is occurred in aoa 17 approximately in fig 18 the lift and drag coefficients for different values of froude number at h c 1 0 and k 0 1 is shown the maximum values of the lift coefficient for froude numbers of 1 154 1 94 and 3 88 occurs at aoa 25 with values of 2 091 1 914 and 1 904 respectively during the upstroke phase of airfoil motion fr 1 154 has the maximum values of the lift coefficient and fr 1 94 has the minimum values of the lift coefficient during the down stroke phase each of these fr numbers has the maximum values of lift coefficient in some ranges of aoa the total average of lift coefficient for fr 1 154 fr 1 94 and 3 88 are 0 581 0 478 and 0 580 respectively the effects of froude number on the drag coefficient during upstroke phase at aoa smaller than 15 and during down stroke phase at aoa smaller than 5 are negligible for fr 1 154 the values of drag coefficient during the upstroke phase are always greater than the values of drag coefficient during the down stroke phase however for fr 3 88 the values of drag coefficient in upstroke phase are smaller than its values in down stroke phase for aoa between 12 5 and 22 56 furthermore similar event is occurred for fr 1 94 at 16 02 aoa 22 73 the effects of pitch amplitude on the lift and drag coefficients of hydrofoil at h c 1 0 and k 0 1 is shown in fig 19 despite to the amplitude of 15 there is no sudden drop at amplitude equal to 5 and 10 at amplitude of 10 the lift coefficient varies from 0 06 to 1 49 and drag coefficient changes from 0 012 to 0 21 furthermore at amplitude of 5 the lift coefficient varies from 0 22 to 0 82 and drag coefficient changes from 0 025 to 0 12 5 conclusion in this study the effects of pitching frequency and various submergence depth ratios on the lift and drag coefficients of naca0012 hydrofoil were investigated numerically the k w sst turbulence model was used for modeling the turbulence features of the flow furthermore the volume of fluid vof method is used to capture the free surface wave between the water and the air phases unlike the stationary hydrofoil the free surface shape of oscillating hydrofoil is an unsteady wave behind the hydrofoil the elevation of the wave crest increases to a critical height after that the wave is broken due to the gravity it can be concluded that by decreasing the submerge depth ratio of hydrofoil the drag coefficient is increased moreover for all submerged depth ratio the maximum drag coefficient is occurred in aoa 17 approximately the maximum value of the lift coefficient is increased by increasing the depth ratio from h c 1 to h c 4 and then decreased by increasing of depth ratio moreover for values of k 0 1 and a o a 15 o a sudden drop in the lift and drag coefficients is occurred at aoa approximately equal to 25 the maximum values of the lift coefficient for froude numbers of 1 154 1 94 and 3 88 occurs at aoa 25 with values of 2 091 1 914 and 1 904 respectively during the upstroke phase of airfoil motion fr 1 154 has the maximum values of the lift coefficient and fr 1 94 has the minimum values of the lift coefficient 
22359,in the present research the turbulent fluid flow around a pitching hydrofoil is studied near the water free surface numerically the k ω sst model is used for turbulence modeling the finite volume method fvm is used for discretizing the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and the free surface is captured by the volume of fluid vof method in order to validate the present simulations the current results are compared with those of given by experimental test cases the first experimental test case is a pitching airfoil in the single phase flow and the second one is a stationary hydrofoil near the free surface furthermore the influence of free surface on hydrofoil drag and lift coefficients are investigated different submergence depths and oscillation frequencies are investigated it is found that both submergence depth and frequency of rotation are affected the lift and drag coefficients significantly keywords pitching hydrofoil free surface volume of fluid turbulent flow 1 introduction the hydrodynamic characteristics of pitching hydrofoil can provide worthwhile information to understand behaviors of underwater vehicles the most important factor in design of these vehicles is to achieve maximum velocity and simultaneously minimizing wasted energy this target can be achieved by using some approaches to decrease drag and also increase thrust force

applied for both top and bottom boundaries the simplec algorithm is employed for pressure velocity coupling of navier stokes equations the body force weighted scheme is utilized for discretization of pressure also the second order upwind scheme is used for discretization of momentum turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate the compressive scheme is applied for discretization of volume fraction the independence of results from the mesh is studied in both static and dynamic configuration of hydrofoil two different high quality structured meshes with 207500 and 356000 cell numbers are generated the mesh sizes on the hydrofoil is refined so that the y on the hydrofoil become lower than one and at least 15 nodes placed in the boundary layer the comparisons of the lift and drag coefficients between two meshes for pitching hydrofoil at h c 1 0 and k 1 0 are shown in fig 6 as can be seen there is a good agreement between the results of both meshes the obtained results from both mesh in static configuration are also approximately close to each other therefore for pitching hydrofoil simulations the coarser mesh was used the close up view of this grid is shown in fig 7 in all simulations of this paper except those otherwise explicitly stated the chord length the free stream velocity and the froude number are 0 15m 1 4 m s and 1 154 respectively for the residuals of all field variables the value of 1e 6 were adopted as the convergence criteria and a sample of iteration history for k 1 0 and h c 1 0 is displayed in fig 8 shapes of the free surface during one period of hydrofoil oscillation for k 1 0 and h c 1 0 are shown in fig 9 the time interval between two successive plots are t 8 unlike the stationary hydrofoil the free surface shape of oscillating hydrofoil is an unsteady wave behind the hydrofoil the elevation of the wave crest increases to a critical height after that the wave is broken due to the gravity moreover the free surface waves are gradually disappeared behind the hydrofoil after 15 times of the chord length shape of the free surface for h c 5 0 are shown in fig 10 as can be seen the amplitude of the wave profiles is negligible therefore the influence of hydrofoil and its oscillation on the free surface shape are completely vanished for values of h c greater than 5 the contour of velocity magnitude around the hydrofoil at different times of one period is displayed in fig 11 for h c 1 0 and k 1 0 the time lag between two consecutive contours is t 4 it is found from the figure that below the crest and the above the trough are the low velocity regions and below the trough is the high velocity region the vorticity contours around the hydrofoil at different angles of attack for k 0 1 and h c 1 0 are shown in fig 12 as can be observed there are two high vorticity regions in the flow domain the hydrofoil surface and above the trough of the wave the high vorticity above the trough is due to the wave break of the free surface when the wave is broken the water of the wave apex goes to the downward direction and hit to the wave trough and cause to increasing in the vorticity value at low angles of attach the boundary layer is attached to the airfoil later a leading edge vortex lev forms in the up stroke phase at aoa of 22 69 and creates a low pressure region over the hydrofoil at the leading edge moreover a trailing edge vortex tev with oppose direction of lev is formed at aoa of 23 92 and finally sheds to downstream by increasing the aoa the lev growths and travels toward the trailing edge this leads to a low pressure region coats the upper surface of the airfoil therefore a sudden rise in the hydrodynamic forces is occurred at aoa equal to 24 6 a vortex with reverse direction of lev is created on the upper surface and near the leading edge subsequently this vortex becomes larger and separates the lev from the upper surface therefore the strength of lev decreases and leads to a sudden drop in the lift coefficient the vorticity contours around the hydrofoil at different angles of attack for k 1 0 and h c 1 0 are shown in fig 13 the pattern of vortices in this reduced frequency is completely different from those pattern in k 0 1 despite to the k 0 1 at k 1 0 on the upper surface only the vortex with negative vorticity is created and the vortex with positive vorticity is created at lower surface of the airfoil as can be seen the lev is created at aoa equal to 20 32 in down stroke phase this vortex growths and move to the trailing edge of the airfoil and remains on the upper surface during entire of down stroke phase of airfoil oscillating during down stroke phase with negative aoa the strength of lev is reduced and completely removed in up stroke phase of airfoil s motion in fig 14 the effects of reduced frequency on the lift coefficients at h c 1 0 are shown for better comparison the values of reduced frequency smaller than 1 0 is shown in fig 14a and the values of reduced frequency larger than 1 0 and k 0 1 is shown in fig 14b as it can be seen in fig 14a for values of k 0 1 a sudden drop is occurred in aoa 24 6 as described in fig 10 this abrupt reduction in lift coefficient is caused by a vortex with positive vorticity that is created at aoa 24 6 on the upper surface and near the leading edge in these sudden drops the lift coefficient are reduced from 2 09 to 0 61 for k 0 1 and from 2 09 to 0 84 for k 0 067 for k 0 25 also a sudden drop of lift coefficient is occurred at aoa 25 however the change of lift coefficient during this sudden drop is relatively small and it reduced from 1 92 to 1 69 after this sudden reduction the lift coefficient remain constant until to aoa 19 and then it gradually reduced to 0 035 at aoa 11 35 the reason of this phenomenon is that at this value of k the positive vortex on the upper surface has not sufficient strength to push the negative vortex lev away from the upper surface of hydrofoil therefore this positive vortex reduces the lift coefficient slightly and then vanishes from the upper surface after disappearing of this positive vortex the lev with negative vorticity remains on the upper surface until aoa 19 as described in fig 11 for values of k greater than 0 5 on the upper surface of hydrofoil only a vortex with negative vorticity is created and vortex with positive vorticity is created only on the lower surface of hydrofoil therefore a sudden drop in the lift coefficient is not occurred at aoa 25 and the lift coefficient is reduces gradually during down stroke phase of hydrofoil oscillation however by increasing the frequency of rotation the variation of the lift coefficient during one period of rotation is increased considerably the maximum value of the lift coefficient for k 1 0 k 2 0 and k 4 0 are equal to 1 5 4 and 13 where happened at aoa 17 aoa 8 and aoa 4 at frequencies larger than k 1 0 the lift coefficient versus the aoa have oval shapes in fig 15 the effects of reduced frequency on the drag coefficients at h c 1 0 are shown for better comparison the values of reduced frequency smaller than 1 0 is shown in fig 15a and the values of reduced frequency larger than 1 0 and k 0 1 is shown in fig 15b similar to the lift coefficient near the aoa 25 a sudden drop in the drag coefficient are occurred for values of k smaller than 0 25 in the higher values of k there are not a sudden drop at aoa 25 the curve of the drag coefficient versus the aoa has two closed loops where connected to each other at aoa 0 approximately the small loop locates between aoa 5 to aoa 0 and the bigger loop locates between aoa 0 to aoa 25 for small values of rotation frequency k 0 25 k 0 5 the changes of the drag coefficient at different values of aoa is small for k 1 0 k 2 0 and k 4 0 the maximum of drag coefficient are 0 52 0 93 and 2 4 where happened at aoa 19 5 aoa 15 7 and aoa 13 5 the changes of lift coefficients for different values of depth ratio h c in a fixed value of frequency ratio k 1 are shown in fig 16 the maximum value of the lift coefficient is increased by increasing the depth ratio from h c 1 0 to h c 4 0 and then decreased by increasing of depth ratio the variations of the drag coefficients at k 1 and different values of depth ratio h c are presented in fig 17 it can be concluded that by decreasing the submerge depth ratio of hydrofoil the drag coefficient is increased moreover for all submerged depth ratio the maximum drag coefficient is occurred in aoa 17 approximately in fig 18 the lift and drag coefficients for different values of froude number at h c 1 0 and k 0 1 is shown the maximum values of the lift coefficient for froude numbers of 1 154 1 94 and 3 88 occurs at aoa 25 with values of 2 091 1 914 and 1 904 respectively during the upstroke phase of airfoil motion fr 1 154 has the maximum values of the lift coefficient and fr 1 94 has the minimum values of the lift coefficient during the down stroke phase each of these fr numbers has the maximum values of lift coefficient in some ranges of aoa the total average of lift coefficient for fr 1 154 fr 1 94 and 3 88 are 0 581 0 478 and 0 580 respectively the effects of froude number on the drag coefficient during upstroke phase at aoa smaller than 15 and during down stroke phase at aoa smaller than 5 are negligible for fr 1 154 the values of drag coefficient during the upstroke phase are always greater than the values of drag coefficient during the down stroke phase however for fr 3 88 the values of drag coefficient in upstroke phase are smaller than its values in down stroke phase for aoa between 12 5 and 22 56 furthermore similar event is occurred for fr 1 94 at 16 02 aoa 22 73 the effects of pitch amplitude on the lift and drag coefficients of hydrofoil at h c 1 0 and k 0 1 is shown in fig 19 despite to the amplitude of 15 there is no sudden drop at amplitude equal to 5 and 10 at amplitude of 10 the lift coefficient varies from 0 06 to 1 49 and drag coefficient changes from 0 012 to 0 21 furthermore at amplitude of 5 the lift coefficient varies from 0 22 to 0 82 and drag coefficient changes from 0 025 to 0 12 5 conclusion in this study the effects of pitching frequency and various submergence depth ratios on the lift and drag coefficients of naca0012 hydrofoil were investigated numerically the k w sst turbulence model was used for modeling the turbulence features of the flow furthermore the volume of fluid vof method is used to capture the free surface wave between the water and the air phases unlike the stationary hydrofoil the free surface shape of oscillating hydrofoil is an unsteady wave behind the hydrofoil the elevation of the wave crest increases to a critical height after that the wave is broken due to the gravity it can be concluded that by decreasing the submerge depth ratio of hydrofoil the drag coefficient is increased moreover for all submerged depth ratio the maximum drag coefficient is occurred in aoa 17 approximately the maximum value of the lift coefficient is increased by increasing the depth ratio from h c 1 to h c 4 and then decreased by increasing of depth ratio moreover for values of k 0 1 and a o a 15 o a sudden drop in the lift and drag coefficients is occurred at aoa approximately equal to 25 the maximum values of the lift coefficient for froude numbers of 1 154 1 94 and 3 88 occurs at aoa 25 with values of 2 091 1 914 and 1 904 respectively during the upstroke phase of airfoil motion fr 1 154 has the maximum values of the lift coefficient and fr 1 94 has the minimum values of the lift coefficient
