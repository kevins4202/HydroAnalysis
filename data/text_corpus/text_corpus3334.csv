16670,surface waters are widely used as drinking water sources and hence their quality needs to be continuously monitored however current routine monitoring programs are not comprehensive as they generally cover only a limited number of known pollutants and emerging contaminants this study presents a risk based approach combining suspect and non target screening nts to help extend the coverage of current monitoring schemes in particular the coverage of nts was widened by combining three complementary separations modes reverse phase rp hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic and mixed mode chromatography mmc suspect lists used were compiled from databases of relevant substances of very high concern e g svhcs and the concentration of detected suspects was evaluated based on ionization efficiency prediction results show that suspect candidates can be prioritized based on their potential risk i e hazard and exposure by combining ionization efficiency based concentration estimation in vitro toxicity data or if not available structural alerts and qsar based toxicity predictions the acquired information shows that nts analyses have the potential to complement target analyses allowing to update and adapt current monitoring programs ultimately leading to improved monitoring of drinking water sources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic micropollutants chemical water quality non target screening hrms data science surface water ionization efficiency chromatography 1 introduction surface waters are widely used as drinking water sources in the specific case of the river meuse it is used as source for drinking water for around 6 million inhabitants in the netherlands and belgium the meuse is a rain river with a strongly varying flow that also receives mostly treated wastewater from households and various industries in france belgium north rhine westphalia and the netherlands moreover the river meuse s basin has a wide spectrum of agricultural activities which lead to emissions of a wide range of organic micro pollutants omps with obvious consequences for the environment drinking water quality and ultimately human health sjerps et al 2017 the revision by the eu of the drinking water directive in september 2017 implemented a principle derived from food safety namely hazard analysis and critical control points haccp which focuses on contaminants that pose a risk this entails the implementation of risk based water quality monitoring tailored to the characteristics of the water sources and treatment types such risk based measurement programs require information on activities or environmental characteristics affecting the source water as well as an inventory of contaminants relevant for source and produced drinking water however current monitoring programs are not comprehensive as from a chemical analytical perspective they generally rely on the implementation of targeted methods e g lc ms ms which cover only a limited set of known compounds e g herbicides pesticides disinfectants pharmaceuticals plasticizers pfas the need to implement screening approaches which allow to detect a broader range of compounds potentially present in river water used for drinking water production has been highlighted also by organizations such as the international commission for the protection of the rhine icpr 2017 in this sense there are various examples in which emerging contaminants in particular omps have been discovered using screening methods baken et al 2016 in an attempt to focus monitoring efforts on contaminants of concern the netherlands national institute for public health and the environment rivm recently compiled lists of substances of very high concern svhc and potential svhc psvhc national institute for public health and environment rivm 2021 consisting of 1527 and 327 priority substances respectively these were selected based on their potential toxicity according to the european registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach regulation european chemicals agency echa 2021 in particular these lists contain all substances designated as of very high concern svhc and svhc candidates supplemented with other substances that require particular attention from a dutch policy perspective personal communication theo traas rivm the dutch and european governments focus on these substances as a precautionary measure in order to minimize their emissions and as a result also risks to humans and the environment in addition to p svhcs substances with persistent mobile and toxic pmts characteristics as well as very persistent and very mobile vpvms properties can also pose a risk for drinking water production hale et al 2020 jin et al 2020 neumann and schliebner 2019 these substances are poorly degradable and affluent in the aquatic environment moreover they are often marginally removed in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants and as a consequence prone to contaminate drinking water therefore a proposal for adding pmt vpvm criteria for the admission of substances within the reach regulation for the protection of drinking water sources was recently published by neumann and schliebner 2019 currently two lists of reach registered substances meet these criteria one comprising 167 substances compiled by the umweltbundesamt uba and a second with 240 compounds compiled by the norwegian geotekniske institutt ngi arp 2018 berger et al 2018 a policy debate is ongoing as to whether the svhc criteria can be expanded within reach to include pmt vpvm substances hence pmt vpvm substances are relevant for the monitoring of drinking water sources however only a fraction of these is currently included in routine targeted monitoring programs to overcome this limitation the current study presents the use of suspect and non target screening methods nts combining liquid chromatography lc and high resolution mass spectrometry hrms to monitor substances in the above mentioned lists using the river meuse as a case study the actual detection limit of compounds depends on the chromatographic conditions used and the ionization efficiency of these compounds in the electrospray ionization esi source used to hyphenate lc and hrms to cover a broad range of chemicals three types of chromatographic separations were used in this study in particular reverse phase rp using a c18 column suitable for separating semi polar substances reemtsma et al 2016 as well as hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic kolkman et al 2021 and mixed mode chromatography mmc vughs et al 2018 for more polar compounds in contrast to conventional rp hilic uses more hydrophilic stationary phases hemström and irgum 2006 while in mmc analytes interact with the stationary phase through multiple mechanisms e g hydrophilic hydrophobic and or ionic interactions zhang and liu 2016 the use of such orthogonal i e rp and hilic and complementary i e mmc chromatographic modes allows for the separation of analytes with a broader range of polarities features detected using these three chromatographic methods were then compared to entries in suspect lists mentioned above as well as databases of environmentally relevant compounds such as the norman susdat norman network 2020 comparisons were made based on experimental ms2 spectra present in data bases but also using in silico predicted spectra in addition concentrations of suspect candidates detected in the lc hrms were then estimated by predicting the ionization efficiency for each of the detected suspect compounds and accounting for the lc conditions used suspects were subsequently prioritized based on risk consisting of exposure levels based on predicted suspect concentrations and hazard assessed through in vitro toxicity data structural alerts or qsars the developed workflow can contribute to risk based monitoring and ultimately shape source protection following a more risk based approach 2 material and methods 2 1 suspect list generation a suspect list of compounds of high concern relevant for surface and drinking water was created by combining the 21 lists of compounds reported in table s1 these were selected because they include chemicals of concern relevant for drinking water quality chemicals were compared between lists based on their cas number to obtain a single list of unique chemicals missing cas numbers were retrieved using the webchem package available in ropensci webchem 2021 2 2 sampling points and samples water samples were collected at the monitoring station of keizersveer i e raw water from the river meuse and from the abstraction point haringvliet i e raw water characterized by a mixture of meuse and rhine the two locations were sampled three times namely with low flows i e september 2018 normal flows i e february 2019 and after a period with a precipitation surplus precipitation exceeds evaporation leading to larger base flows i e may 2019 all samples consisted of grab samples which were collected in 1l hdpe bottles previously rinsed with ultrapure water for each sampling period and location a blank sample consisting of ultrapure water was prepared and stored for analysis i e bottle blank 2 3 target and non target screening 2 3 1 sample preparation collected samples were stored at 20 c and thawed on the day of analysis each sample was prepared in triplicate for rp analysis samples were spiked with the internal standards atrazine d5 and bentazone d6 at a final concentration of 1 µg l prior to analysis for quality control for mixed mode analysis samples were spiked with pfba 13c3 internal standard final concentration 1 µg l for hilic analysis 5 ml sample was transferred to a glass tube and was evaporated to 250 µl at 30 c using an automated blow down apparatus barkey germany thereafter the samples were spiked with chloromequat d9 internal standard 1 µg l and reconstituted in 5 ml 95 5 v v acetonitrile water samples for all chromatographic techniques were filtered through 0 20 µm nylon filters phenomenex torrance usa 2 3 2 lc hrms analysis both targeted and non targeted and suspect screening analyses were carried out using a tribrid orbitrap fusion mass spectrometer thermofisher scientific bremen germany equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source interfaced to a vanquish hplc system thermofisher three different chromatographic conditions i e reverse phase rp hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic and mixed mode mm were used rp chromatographic analysis was performed in positive and negative ionization mode using a xbridge beh c18 xp column 150 2 1 mm i d particle size 2 5 μm waters etten leur the netherlands in combination with a 2 0 2 1 mm i d phenomenex securityguard ultra column phenomenex torrance usa for more polar compounds analyses were performed using a zorbax hilic plus column 150 2 1 mm i d particle size 1 8 μm agilent middelburg the netherlands in positive and a mm acclaim trinity p1 column 100 2 1 mm i d particle size 3 μm thermofisher in negative ionization mode respectively the choice to perform hilic analyses only in positive mode and mm analyses only in negative mode is based on previous experience with these two types of chromatographic columns kolkman et al 2021 in fact it was observed that separation of negatively charged compounds was not very good with hilic hence mm was preferred with respect to acquisition full scan high resolution mass spectra were recorded from 80 to 1300 m z for rp and hilic and 65 to 700 m z for mmc with a resolution of 120 000 fwhm quadrupole isolation was used for acquisition with a 5 ppm mass window data dependent acquisition was performed with high collision dissociation hcd stepped collision energy ce additional information about the chromatographic methods injection ms calibration and acquisition parameters are reported in the supporting information 2 3 3 target compound semi quantification targeted and semi quantitative analyses were carried out for a selection of priority contaminants including pharmaceuticals pesticides industrial and emerging contaminants semi quantification of 135 target compounds see table s2 was performed using a one point calibration curve semi quantified concentrations were determined in all triplicates from the experimental sampling using xcalibur quan browser thermo fisher scientific and results of the triplicates were averaged and reported as a single result the semi quantified concentrations were used to transfer the ionization efficiencies predicted for the suspect compounds into the instrument specific response factors and to validate the accuracy of the suspect concentration prediction see below 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 nts data processing and suspect screening nts data was processed with compound discoverer 3 0 beta version thermo fisher scientific for peak picking componentization and suspect screening an overview of the nts workflow is given in fig s1 the compound discoverer workflow and parameters can be found in fig s2 the output of compound discoverer is a feature list i e a table with accurate mass retention time pairs features and their intensity reported as peak area the suspect list of compounds of high concern relevant for surface and drinking water as described in section 2 1 was used for a suspect screening of the detected features with a 3 ppm mass error tolerance features that were less than ten times higher than the maximum of the blank samples i e instrumental and bottle blanks were removed 2 4 2 features comparison between complementary chromatographic separations for each feature detected with compound discoverer the following parameters were exported using mzvault thermo fisher scientific san jose usa retention time and accurate mass of the molecular ion ms1 accurate mass of the 10 most intense fragment ions ms2 and their relative intensities this was performed for each of the chromatographic conditions i e rp positive and negative hilic and mmc giving 4 feature lists subsequently feature lists were compared i e rp positive and hilic positive rp negative and mm negative to find corresponding features for this i a first filtering step was performed by removing matches where the accurate mass of the molecular ion of the considered features differed more than 10 ppm subsequently ii ms2 spectra were compared between features using the spectrum similary function from the orgmassspecr package dodder and mullen 2017 with a tolerance of 0 005 m z then iii only matches with a similarity score greater than or equal to 0 5 were considered as mzvault exports data per sample features were present multiple times differing slightly in retention time and accurate mass this resulted in redundant matches which were removed to obtain the number of unique features that overlapped between chromatographic conditions i e rp vs hilic and rp vs mmc consequently iv matches between features within the same chromatographic separation with a difference in mass accuracy of 2 ppm and a retention time of 0 1 min were considered duplicates among these the matches with the highest similarity score were kept for comparison purposes 2 4 3 suspect concentration prediction firstly the ionization efficiency values for all of the detected suspect compounds were calculated based on a refined approach previously developed by liigand et al 2020 shortly the prediction is based on the padel descriptors calculated from the compound structure and the eluent parameters yap 2010 the prediction accounts for the organic solvent type acetonitrile the organic solvent content at the time of compound elution eluent ph and the buffer type the approach has been previously validated for the quantification of micropollutants in surface water based on 341 compounds kruve et al 2021 additionally we carried out instrument and workflow specific validation with the compounds that were detected with nts and quantified with targeted methods as described in section 2 3 3 target compound quantification in case several suspects were associated with one lc hrms peak the ionization efficiencies were calculated for all of the suspects thereafter the ionization efficiency values were converted to the instrument specific response factors for this a subset of the targeted semi quantification results was used while the rest of the targeted semi quantification results were used for validation of the ionization efficiency based approach for transferring the ionization efficiency values to instrument specific response factors in rp positive ionization mode 6 compounds were randomly selected so that these compounds would cover a wide retention time range 6 8 19 3 min and wide response factor range over an order of magnitude the compounds were atrazine d5 gabapentin lactam sitagliptin 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole neburon and caffeine the response factors were calculated as the ratio of the peak area from nts lc hrms measurements and the molar concentration obtained from the targeted analysis a linear regression between the predicted ionization efficiencies and calculated response factors was established over all analyzed samples the rest of the 28 compounds semi quantified with targeted analysis were used to validate the accuracy of the predictions in the case of hilic positive mode and rp negative mode ionization data 9 and 5 compounds respectively were semi quantified with the target analysis all these compounds were used for transferring the ionization efficiency values to response factors however for validation of the hilic results a leave one out strategy was used the retention times of these compounds ranged from 4 4 to 8 8 min in hilic positive mode and from 3 2 to 14 4 min in rp negative mode the response factors of the targeted compounds varied more than a factor of 20 in both cases in case of mmc and esi negative mode only two of the suspect compounds could be semi quantified with target analysis methods therefore the number of compounds was insufficient for establishing a relationship between the predicted ionization efficiency values and measured response factors for the rest of the targeted compounds used in validation and all suspected compounds the response factors were thereafter estimated as follows 1 log 10 p r e d i c t e d r e s p o n s e f a c t o r s u s p e c t log 10 i e s u s p e c t b a where a and b are the slope and intercept of the linear regression for logarithmic response factor vs logarithmic predicted ionization efficiency ie for the targeted compounds used for transferring the ionization efficiency values the response factors were further used to predict the concentration of the suspects based on the peak areas measured from the nts and predicted response factors for each suspect a tentative concentration was calculated liigand et al 2020 2 c s u s p e c t p e a k a r e a s u s p e c t p r e d i c t e d r e s p o n s e f a c t o r s u s p e c t for validation the predicted concentration was compared with the concentration measured with targeted methods as a fold base prediction error 3 prediction error max p r e d i c t e d c m e a s u r e d w i t h t r a r g e t e d m e t h o d c m e a s u r e d w i t h t a r g e t e d m e t h o d c p r e d i c t e d c the relative error was used to be able to compare the prediction accuracies for low and high concentrations as the concentrations ranged over almost three orders of magnitude 2 5 risk based prioritization after compound discoverer processing features i e molecular weight retention time and peak area were exported as comma separated values and subsequently imported into rstudio risk based prioritization using data from toxcast was performed as described previously brunner et al 2019 however a novel approach was introduced in this context namely that concentrations estimated from ionization efficiency were used as exposure values instead of internal standard equivalents 2 4 3 an overview of the prioritization workflow is illustrated in fig s12 in brief in vitro toxicity data were retrieved for all the detected suspect compounds from the u s epa s online toxcast data repository invitrodb v3 2 summary downloaded december 4 2019 from https www epa gov chemical research exploring toxcast data downloadable data using their cas numbers as chemical identifiers the files chemical summary 190708 csv and oldstyle ac50 matrix 190708 csv providing ac50 values in µm for all tested chemical assay combinations were used the selected water relevant endpoints included xenobiotic metabolism modulation of hormone systems reactivity stress response reproduction and development general cell viability thyroid toxicity neurotoxicity and ppar receptor activation data handling and visualization were performed in r version 3 6 3 2020 02 29 to calculate a priority score based on exposure and hazard the molar suspect concentration was divided by the 5th percentile of the ac50 values the 5th percentile rather than the minimum ac50 was selected to reduce the potentially disproportionate impact of sensitive assay endpoints the concentration and 5th percentile of water relevant ac50 values were combined into a priority score respectively 4 p r i o r i t y s c o r e c s u s p e c t a c 50 5 t h p e r c e n t i l e a priority score of 1 indicates that the predicted concentration of the suspects equals the 5th percentile of the water relevant ac50 values therefore the higher priority score indicates higher concern it should be noted that ac50 values retrieved from the toxcast repository are assumed to be accurate yet if this should not be the case then calculated priority scores should be revised as some features might be mistakenly included or excluded from the list of prioritized compounds suspects detected with rp positive ionization mode for which no data was available in toxcast were screened for the presence of structural alerts using toxalerts retrieved from toxalerts v3 1 34 1 sushko et al 2012 in addition toxicity of these suspects was assessed based on quantitative structure activity relationships qsars with the qsar toolbox 4 4 https qsartoolbox org using the profiling mode and all available databases including experimental data on endpoints relevant for human health moreover predicted suspect concentrations were compared to the 0 1 µg l signaling value for water quality mons et al 2013 prioritization of chemicals for later structural identification was based on available experimental data profilers and whether suspects exceeded the signaling value suspects were scored in each of the three categories as no priority medium priority or high priority table s5 as risk is a function of both hazard and exposure only a combination of medium or high priority in both hazard human toxicity and or profilers and exposure concentrations could lead to a final medium or high priority suspects with either no priority regarding hazard or exposure were always labelled as no priority 3 results and discussion 3 1 semi quantification of priority contaminants in surface waters through target analyses known priority pollutants consisting of pharmaceuticals pesticides and emerging contaminants were semi quantified by 1 point calibration using rp hilic and mmc in positive rp hilic and negative ionization rp and mmc results are illustrated in fig s3 most compounds were detected with rp i e 48 which also contained the highest number of target compounds namely 92 out of the 132 targets 9 of the 32 hilic targets and 4 of the 14 mmc targets were detected in at least one sample no significant differences in the number of detected targets were observed between the two sampling locations however semi quantified concentrations measured with rp appeared to be slightly higher in the river meuse compared to the combination of meuse and rhine the highest target concentrations were measured for artificial sweeteners such as sucralose and acesulfame 0 3 2 8 µg l rp benzotriazoles 0 01 0 8 µg l rp valsartan acid 0 01 0 8 µg l rp gabapentin 0 02 0 4 µg l rp hexa methoxymethyl melamine hmmm 0 07 0 5 µg l rp melamine 0 7 2 3 µg l hilic metformin 0 5 0 9 µg l hilic dicholoroacetic acid 0 1 4 9 µg l mm perchlorate 0 3 0 6 µg l mm cyanuric acid 0 3 0 7 µg l mm and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid 0 02 0 1 µg l mm 3 2 comparison between semi quantified target concentrations and nts feature areas semi quantitative results were compared to the area of the corresponding nts feature and visualized in scatterplots fig s4 for most compounds a strong and significant pearson correlation r 0 98 p value 0 05 was observed between semi quantified concentrations and corresponding peak areas a few compounds exhibited slightly lower correlations r between 0 8 and 0 9 for instance fenuron tri 2 chloroisopropyl phosphate tcep and 5 6 dimethyl 1h benzotriazole only two compounds namely chloroxuron and neburon had correlations below 0 8 these results were encouraging as they suggested that a strong positive correlation between peak area and semi quantified concentration existed for most compounds this indicates that nts data could also be used to predict concentrations of features hence allowing to include semi quantitative information during the prioritization process 3 3 non target screening using complementary chromatographic separations to extend monitoring efforts beyond pharmaceuticals pesticides and emerging contaminants semi quantified using the 1 point calibration curve nts data was assessed in terms of number of detected features intensities i e peak areas as well as matches with the compiled suspect list compounds of high concern distribution of features in terms of molecular weight and retention time revealed that in addition to feature numbers also feature intensities were higher in hilic and mmc runs compared to rp see figs s6 and s7 interestingly while most compounds eluted within 10 min with hilic with mmc features eluted across the whole gradient yet the highest number was observed towards the end after removal of features whose intensity was equal or below 10x their signal in blanks a total of 531 positive ionization and 856 negative ionization features were detected using rp chromatography 2053 features were detected using hilic positive ionization and 1811 features using mm negative ionization see table s4 also overall feature intensities were higher in hilic and mmc up to 107 and 108 compared to rp up to 105 see figs s6 and s7 features matching between rp and hilic positive ionization as well as rp and mmc negative ionization were searched among all features detected with the described workflow results of matching features found are reported in fig 1 as can be seen from the left side of the figure 130 features were found in both rp and hilic only a weak negative correlation could be found between the retention times r 0 21 p value 0 05 as a substantial number of matching features eluted in the same range of retention times most matching features had m z 300 while only few were above 400 m z see fig s5 among the matching features some appeared multiple times such as oleamide and lamotrigine which were tentatively identified level 2 schymanski et al 2014 twice due the presence of two peaks at different retention times in hilic due to the limited difference in retention times 1 min in both cases it can be assumed that these are positional isomers however in the case of n methyl 2 pyrrolidine the difference in retention time between the two peaks in hilic is much larger approximately 5 min which suggest that these are likely different compounds in the case of rp and mmc negative ionization only 27 matching features could be found in this case no correlation could be found between feature retention time r 0 006 p value 0 05 once again most matching features were below 400 m z see fig s5 overall results show that only a very limited number of matching features i e 130 and 27 for positive and negative ionization respectively could be found across the complementary separation techniques considered in this study these findings highlight that complementary separations using different stationary phases do not only improve the separation of specific compounds but allow to greatly extend the range of compounds that can be detected similar results were recently reported by castro et al 2021 who evaluated rp hilic mmc and super critical fluid chromatography sfc separations in combination with hrms this is of particular importance for so called persistent and mobile organic compounds pmoc which are difficult to analyze using conventional rp liquid chromatography reemtsma et al 2016 as shown in the results presented here comprehensive analytical strategies covering a broad range of polarities are necessary to ensure that these compounds can effectively be detected and identified in water 3 4 risk based suspect prioritization to assess the occurrence of svhcs in the investigated river catchments a suspect screening was performed based on accurate mass matches using the suspect list compiled from p svhc pmt vpvm and additional water relevant compounds in the specific case of mmc the envisaged approach for prioritization i e use of estimated concentrations as exposure values could not be implemented because not enough target compounds were detected to transfer the model used to estimate concentrations as described below hence the risk based prioritization focused only on suspects detected with hilic positive and rp positive and negative hilic allowed to detect more suspects 417 compared to rp 188 in positive and 67 in negative mode the risk based prioritization approach was implemented on these suspects which allowed focusing on those features that potentially pose a threat to human health and the environment such features either represent high concentration compounds or toxic compounds or a combination thereof kruve et al 2021 the concentration of the suspect candidates was predicted based on the ionization efficiency approach and suspect toxicity was estimated based on ac50 values from the toxcast repository or predicted based on structural alerts and or qsars concentration and toxicity data were then combined to calculate a synergistic priority score and rank suspect candidates for identification 3 4 1 water contaminant concentration prediction based on predicted ionization efficiencies to pursue the idea of risk based prioritization the previously developed ionization efficiency prediction model was validated and employed for concentration prediction of suspects the generic ionization efficiency values were predicted based on the padel descriptors calculated from the standardized smiles notations of the suspects and eluent composition at the time of elution the predicted generic ionization efficiency values were transferred into instrument specific response factors with the aid of a subset of the semi quantified targets the remaining semi quantified targets were used to validate the performance of ionization efficiency based concentration prediction the validation revealed that the mean prediction error for the concentration with rp esi positive mode was a factor of 1 7 for the 22 compounds fig 2 a and 2b and the maximum prediction error was an over estimation by a factor of 6 8 compounds used for validation did not incorporate the six compounds used to transfer the predicted ionization efficiencies to instrument specific response factors the prediction accuracy was also compared to the previously used strategy of using the response of a single internal standard for the semi quantification of other suspects to this end the concentration of 27 target compounds was estimated with the response factor of atrazine d5 it was observed that the predicted concentrations of most target compounds were significantly underestimated fig s6 the average prediction error was a factor of 4 0 while the maximum prediction error was an underestimation of a factor of 29 2 therefore a significant improvement in the concentration prediction accuracy could be achieved with the predicted ionization efficiencies to evaluate the performances of the hilic method only 9 target compounds were available therefore a leave one out strategy was used for validation and estimation of the mean prediction error the latter were somewhat larger for the compounds identified with hilic compared to rp on average the prediction error was a factor of 5 0 this is likely to result of the physico chemical properties of the compounds detected with rp and hilic in particular their hydrophobicity with hilic predominantly more polar compounds were detected these are expected to have somewhat lower ionization efficiency in esi and also lower prediction accuracy the mean prediction error in the rp esi negative mode was a factor of 3 1 however only 5 suspects were also semi quantified with the targeted method which is the minimum number of features needed to transfer predicted ionization efficiency values to response factors and all of these compounds were used to establish a correlation between predicted ionization efficiency values and instrumental response factors for mmc the ionization efficiency values could be calculated only for 2 out of the 4 target compounds and therefore ionization efficiency based concentration prediction could not be used for mmc as mentioned previously the envisaged risk based approach could consequently not be implemented for mmc because no concentrations could be estimated overall the ionization efficiency based concentration prediction results for the target compounds indicate that a mean prediction error of a factor of 5 or better can be expected it should be noted that in this context a limited number of internal standards were used and given the reproducibility in both chromatography and acquisition this did not seem to have a negative effect on the accuracy of concentration prediction nevertheless for future analyses the addition of a larger number of internal standards should be contemplated in particular if a larger number of samples and or sampling points are considered during the analyses the validated model was thereafter used to predict the concentrations of suspect candidates firstly we evaluated the distribution in terms of retention time m z and intensity of the suspects versus compounds used for training the ionization efficiency prediction model a good overlap was observed for both positive rp and hilic and negative rp esi mode see fig 2c and 2d thereafter the concentrations of the detected suspects were predicted the concentrations ranged from 0 9 to 1 6 µg l with rp positive mode while the concentrations predicted for suspects detected with hilic ranged from 0 1 to 65 7 µg l the concentrations predicted for suspects detected with rp in negative mode ionization ranged from 17 to 2 0 µg l additional details are reported in table s4 3 4 2 priority score based on toxcast toxicity data and predicted concentration toxicity data were available in toxcast for roughly two thirds of all detected suspects i e for 100 of the 153 suspects detected with rp positive ionization for 46 of the 67 detected with rp in negative ionization and for 271 of the 417 detected in positive mode with hilic suspects detected in rp positive ionization were tested in at least 64 and at most 1092 bioassays in toxcast mean 453 for negative ionization at least 64 and at most 1088 assays have been used mean 372 bioassays those detected with hilic had been tested in at least 45 and at most 1091 assays mean 443 bioassays 82 of the suspects detected with rp positive ionization mode were active in at least one assay and 80 of these were also active in water relevant endpoints i e xenobiotic metabolism hormone mediated reactivity stress response general cell viability neurotoxicity ppar receptor activation or thyroid toxicity water relevant suspects were active in a minimum of one and a maximum of 91 assays i e 17alpha estradiol fig s11 the 5th percentile of the toxcast ac50 was determined for each suspect to reduce the potentially disproportionate impact of sensitive assay endpoints predicted suspect concentrations were combined with the 5th percentile ac50 values to calculate a synergistic priority score eq 4 and supplementary file si prioscores rp pos neg hilic xlsx the higher the score the higher the potential risk posed by a suspect priority scores for suspects detected with rp and positive ionization ranged from 308 1 ethyl 2 pyrrolidinone to 1 6 10 6 diphenylamine shown in fig 3 predicted concentrations of the detected suspects ranged from 10 12 to 10 9 m while the 5th percentile of the ac50 values ranged from 10 12 to 10 5 m the ac50 overall affected the priority score more than the detected concentrations in particular because these did not vary greatly between locations and sampling periods for additional information about differences in features between sampling locations and seasons see figs s9 and s10 in the supporting information suspects were often ranked together regardless of their detection in different surface waters and or seasons such as 1 ethyl 2 pyrrolidinone scores from 21 to 309 1 2 3 benzotriazole 1 4 0 6 tris 1 chloro 2 propanyl phosphate 0 6 0 4 or caffeine 0 5 0 2 table s3 and see supplementary file si prioscores rp pos neg hilic xlsx the structure of the top 10 prioritized features in rp positive and negative ionization and hilic should be confirmed in future studies so that current monitoring schemes for polar chemicals which mainly rely on targeted lc ms ms analysis can be expanded to include the newly identified compounds 3 5 toxicity assessment based on structural alerts and qsars priority score based suspect ranking relied on in vitro toxicity data availability in toxcast for 53 suspects detected with rp in positive ionization mode no toxcast data was available therefore an alternative approach based on the presence of structural alerts that could indicate toxicity and qsars was used to assess toxicity 19 suspects comprised one to seven structural alerts supplementary file si toxalerts rppos xlsx a total of 62 structural alerts were detected 10 of which indicated endocrine disruption 7 non genotoxic carcinogenicity and 45 genotoxic carcinogenicity or mutagenicity the threshold of toxicological concern ttc derives target values for drinking water contaminants21 for individual genotoxic and steroid endocrine chemicals at 0 01 μg l and all other organic chemicals at 0 1 μg l as all suspects exhibited a structural alert related to genotoxicity or endocrine disruption a ttc of 0 01 ug l was applied resulting in 16 of the 19 suspects with an alert exceeding the ttc table s3 10 of these suspects were detected with maximum suspect concentration in the keizersveer meuse and rhine sample from september three in the keizersveer meuse and rhine sample from february and three in the haringvliet meuse sample from may in addition experimental toxicity data for the 53 suspects without toxcast data were retrieved using the qsar toolbox suspects were prioritized based on a combined score for both the hazard based on experimental data and profilers and the exposure supplementary file si qsar rppos xlsx 4 methyl 1 2 3 benzotriazole exceeded the signaling value of 1 0 µg l and eight suspects 0 1 µg l table s3 for one of these nine suspects n n dibutylformamide no experimental data was available and the profilers did not show significant hazard despite a medium priority score based on predicted concentration this suspect was thus not prioritized for five suspects i e 1 2 diacetylbenzene 2 methyl 2h benzotriazole metolcarb 4 formylaminoantipyrine and n acetylaminoantipyrine no experimental data was available but possibly hazardous alerts as these suspects exceeded 0 1 µg l they were categorized as medium priority three suspects were categorized high priority as they were found at concentrations exceeding 1 µg l i e 4 methyl 1 2 3 benzotriazole or 0 1 µg l and either exhibited high priority scores based on experimental data i e 1 2 diacetylbenzene high priority scores based on profilers i e 4 methyl 1 2 3 benzotriazole or both i e benalaxyl 4 conclusion nts based identification of unknown features remains time and labor intensive particularly in environmental samples with chemicals present at sub µg l levels in the specific context of large river catchments prior selection and exclusion of compounds based on compiled lists or maps of emission sources is hampered by both the large number of such source and the fragmented information about their emissions it is therefore essential to use comprehensive yet relevant suspect lists when screening for contaminants in such catchments in particular if these are being used for drinking water production findings presented here illustrate that the use of extensive yet relevant suspect lists combined with risk based prioritization workflows is a promising approach to tackle such complexity in particular a risk based prioritization workflow was developed and implemented to select only suspects posing the greatest risk to drinking water and simultaneously allowing to focus future elucidation efforts only on the most relevant compounds regarding development of a risk based monitoring strategy the combination of 1 point calibration target semi quantification and nts in one lc hrms analysis seems promising moreover based on ionization efficiencies the concentrations of suspect chemicals could be predicted in the future a selection of target analyses could therefore become obsolete as quantification of these targets can be integrated into nts workflows in fact after identification newly detected emerging contaminants could be added to the nts based quantification approach presented here furthermore the added value of using complementary chromatographic techniques to conventional rp recently highlighted in the literature was further confirmed in this context in particular a broader range of polarities and hence a larger number of features could be detected by including hilic and mmc

16670,surface waters are widely used as drinking water sources and hence their quality needs to be continuously monitored however current routine monitoring programs are not comprehensive as they generally cover only a limited number of known pollutants and emerging contaminants this study presents a risk based approach combining suspect and non target screening nts to help extend the coverage of current monitoring schemes in particular the coverage of nts was widened by combining three complementary separations modes reverse phase rp hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic and mixed mode chromatography mmc suspect lists used were compiled from databases of relevant substances of very high concern e g svhcs and the concentration of detected suspects was evaluated based on ionization efficiency prediction results show that suspect candidates can be prioritized based on their potential risk i e hazard and exposure by combining ionization efficiency based concentration estimation in vitro toxicity data or if not available structural alerts and qsar based toxicity predictions the acquired information shows that nts analyses have the potential to complement target analyses allowing to update and adapt current monitoring programs ultimately leading to improved monitoring of drinking water sources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic micropollutants chemical water quality non target screening hrms data science surface water ionization efficiency chromatography 1 introduction surface waters are widely used as drinking water sources in the specific case of the river meuse it is used as source for drinking water for around 6 million inhabitants in the netherlands and belgium the meuse is a rain river with a strongly varying flow that also receives mostly treated wastewater from households and various industries in france belgium north rhine westphalia and the netherlands moreover the river meuse s basin has a wide spectrum of agricultural activities which lead to emissions of a wide range of organic micro pollutants omps with obvious consequences for the environment drinking water quality and ultimately human health sjerps et al 2017 the revision by the eu of the drinking water directive in september 2017 implemented a principle derived from food safety namely hazard analysis and critical control points haccp which focuses on contaminants that pose a risk this entails the implementation of risk based water quality monitoring tailored to the characteristics of the water sources and treatment types such risk based measurement programs require information on activities or environmental characteristics affecting the source water as well as an inventory of contaminants relevant for source and produced drinking water however current monitoring programs are not comprehensive as from a chemical analytical perspective they generally rely on the implementation of targeted methods e g lc ms ms which cover only a limited set of known compounds e g herbicides pesticides disinfectants pharmaceuticals plasticizers pfas the need to implement screening approaches which allow to detect a broader range of compounds potentially present in river water used for drinking water production has been highlighted also by organizations such as the international commission for the protection of the rhine icpr 2017 in this sense there are various examples in which emerging contaminants in particular omps have been discovered using screening methods baken et al 2016 in an attempt to focus monitoring efforts on contaminants of concern the netherlands national institute for public health and the environment rivm recently compiled lists of substances of very high concern svhc and potential svhc psvhc national institute for public health and environment rivm 2021 consisting of 1527 and 327 priority substances respectively these were selected based on their potential toxicity according to the european registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach regulation european chemicals agency echa 2021 in particular these lists contain all substances designated as of very high concern svhc and svhc candidates supplemented with other substances that require particular attention from a dutch policy perspective personal communication theo traas rivm the dutch and european governments focus on these substances as a precautionary measure in order to minimize their emissions and as a result also risks to humans and the environment in addition to p svhcs substances with persistent mobile and toxic pmts characteristics as well as very persistent and very mobile vpvms properties can also pose a risk for drinking water production hale et al 2020 jin et al 2020 neumann and schliebner 2019 these substances are poorly degradable and affluent in the aquatic environment moreover they are often marginally removed in wastewater and drinking water treatment plants and as a consequence prone to contaminate drinking water therefore a proposal for adding pmt vpvm criteria for the admission of substances within the reach regulation for the protection of drinking water sources was recently published by neumann and schliebner 2019 currently two lists of reach registered substances meet these criteria one comprising 167 substances compiled by the umweltbundesamt uba and a second with 240 compounds compiled by the norwegian geotekniske institutt ngi arp 2018 berger et al 2018 a policy debate is ongoing as to whether the svhc criteria can be expanded within reach to include pmt vpvm substances hence pmt vpvm substances are relevant for the monitoring of drinking water sources however only a fraction of these is currently included in routine targeted monitoring programs to overcome this limitation the current study presents the use of suspect and non target screening methods nts combining liquid chromatography lc and high resolution mass spectrometry hrms to monitor substances in the above mentioned lists using the river meuse as a case study the actual detection limit of compounds depends on the chromatographic conditions used and the ionization efficiency of these compounds in the electrospray ionization esi source used to hyphenate lc and hrms to cover a broad range of chemicals three types of chromatographic separations were used in this study in particular reverse phase rp using a c18 column suitable for separating semi polar substances reemtsma et al 2016 as well as hydrophilic interaction chromatography hilic kolkman et al 2021 and mixed mode chromatography mmc vughs et al 2018 for more polar compounds in contrast to conventional rp hilic uses more hydrophilic stationary phases hemström and irgum 2006 while in mmc analytes interact with the stationary phase through multiple mechanisms e g hydrophilic hydrophobic and or ionic interactions zhang and liu 2016 the use of such orthogonal i e rp and hilic and complementary i e mmc chromatographic modes allows for the separation of analytes with a broader range of polarities features detected using these three chromatographic methods were then compared to entries in suspect lists mentioned above as well as databases of environmentally relevant compounds such as the norman susdat norman network 2020 comparisons were made based on experimental ms2 spectra present in data bases but also using in silico predicted spectra in addition concentrations of suspect candidates detected in the lc hrms were then estimated by predicting the ionization efficiency for each of the detected suspect compounds and accounting for the lc conditions used suspects were subsequently prioritized based on risk consisting of exposure levels based on predicted suspect concentrations and hazard assessed through in vitro toxicity data structural alerts or qsars the developed workflow can contribute to risk based monitoring and ultimately shape source protection following a more risk based approach 2 material and methods 2 1 suspect list generation a suspect list of compounds of high concern relevant for surface and drinking water was created by combining the 21 lists of compounds reported in table s1 these were selected because they include chemicals of concern relevant for drinking water quality chemicals were compared between lists based on their cas number to obtain a single list of unique chemicals missing cas numbers were retrieved using the webchem package available in ropensci webchem 2021 2 2 sampling points and samples water samples were collected at the monitoring station of keizersveer i e raw water from the river meuse and from the abstraction point haringvliet i e raw water characterized by a mixture of meuse and rhine the two locations were sampled three times namely with low flows i e september 2018 normal flows i e february 2019 and after a period with a precipitation surplus precipitation exceeds evaporation leading to larger base flows i e may 2019 all samples consisted of grab samples which were collected in 1l hdpe bottles previously rinsed with ultrapure water for each sampling period and location a blank sample consisting of ultrapure water was prepared and stored for analysis i e bottle blank 2 3 target and non target screening 2 3 1 sample preparation collected samples were stored at 20 c and thawed on the day of analysis each sample was prepared in triplicate for rp analysis samples were spiked with the internal standards atrazine d5 and bentazone d6 at a final concentration of 1 µg l prior to analysis for quality control for mixed mode analysis samples were spiked with pfba 13c3 internal standard final concentration 1 µg l for hilic analysis 5 ml sample was transferred to a glass tube and was evaporated to 250 µl at 30 c using an automated blow down apparatus barkey germany thereafter the samples were spiked with chloromequat d9 internal standard 1 µg l and reconstituted in 5 ml 95 5 v v acetonitrile water samples for all chromatographic techniques were filtered through 0 20 µm nylon filters phenomenex torrance usa 2 3 2 lc hrms analysis both targeted and non targeted and suspect screening analyses were carried out using a tribrid orbitrap fusion mass spectrometer thermofisher scientific bremen germany equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source interfaced to a vanquish hplc system thermofisher three different chromatographic conditions i e reverse phase rp hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography hilic and mixed mode mm were used rp chromatographic analysis was performed in positive and negative ionization mode using a xbridge beh c18 xp column 150 2 1 mm i d particle size 2 5 μm waters etten leur the netherlands in combination with a 2 0 2 1 mm i d phenomenex securityguard ultra column phenomenex torrance usa for more polar compounds analyses were performed using a zorbax hilic plus column 150 2 1 mm i d particle size 1 8 μm agilent middelburg the netherlands in positive and a mm acclaim trinity p1 column 100 2 1 mm i d particle size 3 μm thermofisher in negative ionization mode respectively the choice to perform hilic analyses only in positive mode and mm analyses only in negative mode is based on previous experience with these two types of chromatographic columns kolkman et al 2021 in fact it was observed that separation of negatively charged compounds was not very good with hilic hence mm was preferred with respect to acquisition full scan high resolution mass spectra were recorded from 80 to 1300 m z for rp and hilic and 65 to 700 m z for mmc with a resolution of 120 000 fwhm quadrupole isolation was used for acquisition with a 5 ppm mass window data dependent acquisition was performed with high collision dissociation hcd stepped collision energy ce additional information about the chromatographic methods injection ms calibration and acquisition parameters are reported in the supporting information 2 3 3 target compound semi quantification targeted and semi quantitative analyses were carried out for a selection of priority contaminants including pharmaceuticals pesticides industrial and emerging contaminants semi quantification of 135 target compounds see table s2 was performed using a one point calibration curve semi quantified concentrations were determined in all triplicates from the experimental sampling using xcalibur quan browser thermo fisher scientific and results of the triplicates were averaged and reported as a single result the semi quantified concentrations were used to transfer the ionization efficiencies predicted for the suspect compounds into the instrument specific response factors and to validate the accuracy of the suspect concentration prediction see below 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 nts data processing and suspect screening nts data was processed with compound discoverer 3 0 beta version thermo fisher scientific for peak picking componentization and suspect screening an overview of the nts workflow is given in fig s1 the compound discoverer workflow and parameters can be found in fig s2 the output of compound discoverer is a feature list i e a table with accurate mass retention time pairs features and their intensity reported as peak area the suspect list of compounds of high concern relevant for surface and drinking water as described in section 2 1 was used for a suspect screening of the detected features with a 3 ppm mass error tolerance features that were less than ten times higher than the maximum of the blank samples i e instrumental and bottle blanks were removed 2 4 2 features comparison between complementary chromatographic separations for each feature detected with compound discoverer the following parameters were exported using mzvault thermo fisher scientific san jose usa retention time and accurate mass of the molecular ion ms1 accurate mass of the 10 most intense fragment ions ms2 and their relative intensities this was performed for each of the chromatographic conditions i e rp positive and negative hilic and mmc giving 4 feature lists subsequently feature lists were compared i e rp positive and hilic positive rp negative and mm negative to find corresponding features for this i a first filtering step was performed by removing matches where the accurate mass of the molecular ion of the considered features differed more than 10 ppm subsequently ii ms2 spectra were compared between features using the spectrum similary function from the orgmassspecr package dodder and mullen 2017 with a tolerance of 0 005 m z then iii only matches with a similarity score greater than or equal to 0 5 were considered as mzvault exports data per sample features were present multiple times differing slightly in retention time and accurate mass this resulted in redundant matches which were removed to obtain the number of unique features that overlapped between chromatographic conditions i e rp vs hilic and rp vs mmc consequently iv matches between features within the same chromatographic separation with a difference in mass accuracy of 2 ppm and a retention time of 0 1 min were considered duplicates among these the matches with the highest similarity score were kept for comparison purposes 2 4 3 suspect concentration prediction firstly the ionization efficiency values for all of the detected suspect compounds were calculated based on a refined approach previously developed by liigand et al 2020 shortly the prediction is based on the padel descriptors calculated from the compound structure and the eluent parameters yap 2010 the prediction accounts for the organic solvent type acetonitrile the organic solvent content at the time of compound elution eluent ph and the buffer type the approach has been previously validated for the quantification of micropollutants in surface water based on 341 compounds kruve et al 2021 additionally we carried out instrument and workflow specific validation with the compounds that were detected with nts and quantified with targeted methods as described in section 2 3 3 target compound quantification in case several suspects were associated with one lc hrms peak the ionization efficiencies were calculated for all of the suspects thereafter the ionization efficiency values were converted to the instrument specific response factors for this a subset of the targeted semi quantification results was used while the rest of the targeted semi quantification results were used for validation of the ionization efficiency based approach for transferring the ionization efficiency values to instrument specific response factors in rp positive ionization mode 6 compounds were randomly selected so that these compounds would cover a wide retention time range 6 8 19 3 min and wide response factor range over an order of magnitude the compounds were atrazine d5 gabapentin lactam sitagliptin 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole neburon and caffeine the response factors were calculated as the ratio of the peak area from nts lc hrms measurements and the molar concentration obtained from the targeted analysis a linear regression between the predicted ionization efficiencies and calculated response factors was established over all analyzed samples the rest of the 28 compounds semi quantified with targeted analysis were used to validate the accuracy of the predictions in the case of hilic positive mode and rp negative mode ionization data 9 and 5 compounds respectively were semi quantified with the target analysis all these compounds were used for transferring the ionization efficiency values to response factors however for validation of the hilic results a leave one out strategy was used the retention times of these compounds ranged from 4 4 to 8 8 min in hilic positive mode and from 3 2 to 14 4 min in rp negative mode the response factors of the targeted compounds varied more than a factor of 20 in both cases in case of mmc and esi negative mode only two of the suspect compounds could be semi quantified with target analysis methods therefore the number of compounds was insufficient for establishing a relationship between the predicted ionization efficiency values and measured response factors for the rest of the targeted compounds used in validation and all suspected compounds the response factors were thereafter estimated as follows 1 log 10 p r e d i c t e d r e s p o n s e f a c t o r s u s p e c t log 10 i e s u s p e c t b a where a and b are the slope and intercept of the linear regression for logarithmic response factor vs logarithmic predicted ionization efficiency ie for the targeted compounds used for transferring the ionization efficiency values the response factors were further used to predict the concentration of the suspects based on the peak areas measured from the nts and predicted response factors for each suspect a tentative concentration was calculated liigand et al 2020 2 c s u s p e c t p e a k a r e a s u s p e c t p r e d i c t e d r e s p o n s e f a c t o r s u s p e c t for validation the predicted concentration was compared with the concentration measured with targeted methods as a fold base prediction error 3 prediction error max p r e d i c t e d c m e a s u r e d w i t h t r a r g e t e d m e t h o d c m e a s u r e d w i t h t a r g e t e d m e t h o d c p r e d i c t e d c the relative error was used to be able to compare the prediction accuracies for low and high concentrations as the concentrations ranged over almost three orders of magnitude 2 5 risk based prioritization after compound discoverer processing features i e molecular weight retention time and peak area were exported as comma separated values and subsequently imported into rstudio risk based prioritization using data from toxcast was performed as described previously brunner et al 2019 however a novel approach was introduced in this context namely that concentrations estimated from ionization efficiency were used as exposure values instead of internal standard equivalents 2 4 3 an overview of the prioritization workflow is illustrated in fig s12 in brief in vitro toxicity data were retrieved for all the detected suspect compounds from the u s epa s online toxcast data repository invitrodb v3 2 summary downloaded december 4 2019 from https www epa gov chemical research exploring toxcast data downloadable data using their cas numbers as chemical identifiers the files chemical summary 190708 csv and oldstyle ac50 matrix 190708 csv providing ac50 values in µm for all tested chemical assay combinations were used the selected water relevant endpoints included xenobiotic metabolism modulation of hormone systems reactivity stress response reproduction and development general cell viability thyroid toxicity neurotoxicity and ppar receptor activation data handling and visualization were performed in r version 3 6 3 2020 02 29 to calculate a priority score based on exposure and hazard the molar suspect concentration was divided by the 5th percentile of the ac50 values the 5th percentile rather than the minimum ac50 was selected to reduce the potentially disproportionate impact of sensitive assay endpoints the concentration and 5th percentile of water relevant ac50 values were combined into a priority score respectively 4 p r i o r i t y s c o r e c s u s p e c t a c 50 5 t h p e r c e n t i l e a priority score of 1 indicates that the predicted concentration of the suspects equals the 5th percentile of the water relevant ac50 values therefore the higher priority score indicates higher concern it should be noted that ac50 values retrieved from the toxcast repository are assumed to be accurate yet if this should not be the case then calculated priority scores should be revised as some features might be mistakenly included or excluded from the list of prioritized compounds suspects detected with rp positive ionization mode for which no data was available in toxcast were screened for the presence of structural alerts using toxalerts retrieved from toxalerts v3 1 34 1 sushko et al 2012 in addition toxicity of these suspects was assessed based on quantitative structure activity relationships qsars with the qsar toolbox 4 4 https qsartoolbox org using the profiling mode and all available databases including experimental data on endpoints relevant for human health moreover predicted suspect concentrations were compared to the 0 1 µg l signaling value for water quality mons et al 2013 prioritization of chemicals for later structural identification was based on available experimental data profilers and whether suspects exceeded the signaling value suspects were scored in each of the three categories as no priority medium priority or high priority table s5 as risk is a function of both hazard and exposure only a combination of medium or high priority in both hazard human toxicity and or profilers and exposure concentrations could lead to a final medium or high priority suspects with either no priority regarding hazard or exposure were always labelled as no priority 3 results and discussion 3 1 semi quantification of priority contaminants in surface waters through target analyses known priority pollutants consisting of pharmaceuticals pesticides and emerging contaminants were semi quantified by 1 point calibration using rp hilic and mmc in positive rp hilic and negative ionization rp and mmc results are illustrated in fig s3 most compounds were detected with rp i e 48 which also contained the highest number of target compounds namely 92 out of the 132 targets 9 of the 32 hilic targets and 4 of the 14 mmc targets were detected in at least one sample no significant differences in the number of detected targets were observed between the two sampling locations however semi quantified concentrations measured with rp appeared to be slightly higher in the river meuse compared to the combination of meuse and rhine the highest target concentrations were measured for artificial sweeteners such as sucralose and acesulfame 0 3 2 8 µg l rp benzotriazoles 0 01 0 8 µg l rp valsartan acid 0 01 0 8 µg l rp gabapentin 0 02 0 4 µg l rp hexa methoxymethyl melamine hmmm 0 07 0 5 µg l rp melamine 0 7 2 3 µg l hilic metformin 0 5 0 9 µg l hilic dicholoroacetic acid 0 1 4 9 µg l mm perchlorate 0 3 0 6 µg l mm cyanuric acid 0 3 0 7 µg l mm and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid 0 02 0 1 µg l mm 3 2 comparison between semi quantified target concentrations and nts feature areas semi quantitative results were compared to the area of the corresponding nts feature and visualized in scatterplots fig s4 for most compounds a strong and significant pearson correlation r 0 98 p value 0 05 was observed between semi quantified concentrations and corresponding peak areas a few compounds exhibited slightly lower correlations r between 0 8 and 0 9 for instance fenuron tri 2 chloroisopropyl phosphate tcep and 5 6 dimethyl 1h benzotriazole only two compounds namely chloroxuron and neburon had correlations below 0 8 these results were encouraging as they suggested that a strong positive correlation between peak area and semi quantified concentration existed for most compounds this indicates that nts data could also be used to predict concentrations of features hence allowing to include semi quantitative information during the prioritization process 3 3 non target screening using complementary chromatographic separations to extend monitoring efforts beyond pharmaceuticals pesticides and emerging contaminants semi quantified using the 1 point calibration curve nts data was assessed in terms of number of detected features intensities i e peak areas as well as matches with the compiled suspect list compounds of high concern distribution of features in terms of molecular weight and retention time revealed that in addition to feature numbers also feature intensities were higher in hilic and mmc runs compared to rp see figs s6 and s7 interestingly while most compounds eluted within 10 min with hilic with mmc features eluted across the whole gradient yet the highest number was observed towards the end after removal of features whose intensity was equal or below 10x their signal in blanks a total of 531 positive ionization and 856 negative ionization features were detected using rp chromatography 2053 features were detected using hilic positive ionization and 1811 features using mm negative ionization see table s4 also overall feature intensities were higher in hilic and mmc up to 107 and 108 compared to rp up to 105 see figs s6 and s7 features matching between rp and hilic positive ionization as well as rp and mmc negative ionization were searched among all features detected with the described workflow results of matching features found are reported in fig 1 as can be seen from the left side of the figure 130 features were found in both rp and hilic only a weak negative correlation could be found between the retention times r 0 21 p value 0 05 as a substantial number of matching features eluted in the same range of retention times most matching features had m z 300 while only few were above 400 m z see fig s5 among the matching features some appeared multiple times such as oleamide and lamotrigine which were tentatively identified level 2 schymanski et al 2014 twice due the presence of two peaks at different retention times in hilic due to the limited difference in retention times 1 min in both cases it can be assumed that these are positional isomers however in the case of n methyl 2 pyrrolidine the difference in retention time between the two peaks in hilic is much larger approximately 5 min which suggest that these are likely different compounds in the case of rp and mmc negative ionization only 27 matching features could be found in this case no correlation could be found between feature retention time r 0 006 p value 0 05 once again most matching features were below 400 m z see fig s5 overall results show that only a very limited number of matching features i e 130 and 27 for positive and negative ionization respectively could be found across the complementary separation techniques considered in this study these findings highlight that complementary separations using different stationary phases do not only improve the separation of specific compounds but allow to greatly extend the range of compounds that can be detected similar results were recently reported by castro et al 2021 who evaluated rp hilic mmc and super critical fluid chromatography sfc separations in combination with hrms this is of particular importance for so called persistent and mobile organic compounds pmoc which are difficult to analyze using conventional rp liquid chromatography reemtsma et al 2016 as shown in the results presented here comprehensive analytical strategies covering a broad range of polarities are necessary to ensure that these compounds can effectively be detected and identified in water 3 4 risk based suspect prioritization to assess the occurrence of svhcs in the investigated river catchments a suspect screening was performed based on accurate mass matches using the suspect list compiled from p svhc pmt vpvm and additional water relevant compounds in the specific case of mmc the envisaged approach for prioritization i e use of estimated concentrations as exposure values could not be implemented because not enough target compounds were detected to transfer the model used to estimate concentrations as described below hence the risk based prioritization focused only on suspects detected with hilic positive and rp positive and negative hilic allowed to detect more suspects 417 compared to rp 188 in positive and 67 in negative mode the risk based prioritization approach was implemented on these suspects which allowed focusing on those features that potentially pose a threat to human health and the environment such features either represent high concentration compounds or toxic compounds or a combination thereof kruve et al 2021 the concentration of the suspect candidates was predicted based on the ionization efficiency approach and suspect toxicity was estimated based on ac50 values from the toxcast repository or predicted based on structural alerts and or qsars concentration and toxicity data were then combined to calculate a synergistic priority score and rank suspect candidates for identification 3 4 1 water contaminant concentration prediction based on predicted ionization efficiencies to pursue the idea of risk based prioritization the previously developed ionization efficiency prediction model was validated and employed for concentration prediction of suspects the generic ionization efficiency values were predicted based on the padel descriptors calculated from the standardized smiles notations of the suspects and eluent composition at the time of elution the predicted generic ionization efficiency values were transferred into instrument specific response factors with the aid of a subset of the semi quantified targets the remaining semi quantified targets were used to validate the performance of ionization efficiency based concentration prediction the validation revealed that the mean prediction error for the concentration with rp esi positive mode was a factor of 1 7 for the 22 compounds fig 2 a and 2b and the maximum prediction error was an over estimation by a factor of 6 8 compounds used for validation did not incorporate the six compounds used to transfer the predicted ionization efficiencies to instrument specific response factors the prediction accuracy was also compared to the previously used strategy of using the response of a single internal standard for the semi quantification of other suspects to this end the concentration of 27 target compounds was estimated with the response factor of atrazine d5 it was observed that the predicted concentrations of most target compounds were significantly underestimated fig s6 the average prediction error was a factor of 4 0 while the maximum prediction error was an underestimation of a factor of 29 2 therefore a significant improvement in the concentration prediction accuracy could be achieved with the predicted ionization efficiencies to evaluate the performances of the hilic method only 9 target compounds were available therefore a leave one out strategy was used for validation and estimation of the mean prediction error the latter were somewhat larger for the compounds identified with hilic compared to rp on average the prediction error was a factor of 5 0 this is likely to result of the physico chemical properties of the compounds detected with rp and hilic in particular their hydrophobicity with hilic predominantly more polar compounds were detected these are expected to have somewhat lower ionization efficiency in esi and also lower prediction accuracy the mean prediction error in the rp esi negative mode was a factor of 3 1 however only 5 suspects were also semi quantified with the targeted method which is the minimum number of features needed to transfer predicted ionization efficiency values to response factors and all of these compounds were used to establish a correlation between predicted ionization efficiency values and instrumental response factors for mmc the ionization efficiency values could be calculated only for 2 out of the 4 target compounds and therefore ionization efficiency based concentration prediction could not be used for mmc as mentioned previously the envisaged risk based approach could consequently not be implemented for mmc because no concentrations could be estimated overall the ionization efficiency based concentration prediction results for the target compounds indicate that a mean prediction error of a factor of 5 or better can be expected it should be noted that in this context a limited number of internal standards were used and given the reproducibility in both chromatography and acquisition this did not seem to have a negative effect on the accuracy of concentration prediction nevertheless for future analyses the addition of a larger number of internal standards should be contemplated in particular if a larger number of samples and or sampling points are considered during the analyses the validated model was thereafter used to predict the concentrations of suspect candidates firstly we evaluated the distribution in terms of retention time m z and intensity of the suspects versus compounds used for training the ionization efficiency prediction model a good overlap was observed for both positive rp and hilic and negative rp esi mode see fig 2c and 2d thereafter the concentrations of the detected suspects were predicted the concentrations ranged from 0 9 to 1 6 µg l with rp positive mode while the concentrations predicted for suspects detected with hilic ranged from 0 1 to 65 7 µg l the concentrations predicted for suspects detected with rp in negative mode ionization ranged from 17 to 2 0 µg l additional details are reported in table s4 3 4 2 priority score based on toxcast toxicity data and predicted concentration toxicity data were available in toxcast for roughly two thirds of all detected suspects i e for 100 of the 153 suspects detected with rp positive ionization for 46 of the 67 detected with rp in negative ionization and for 271 of the 417 detected in positive mode with hilic suspects detected in rp positive ionization were tested in at least 64 and at most 1092 bioassays in toxcast mean 453 for negative ionization at least 64 and at most 1088 assays have been used mean 372 bioassays those detected with hilic had been tested in at least 45 and at most 1091 assays mean 443 bioassays 82 of the suspects detected with rp positive

viability neurotoxicity ppar receptor activation or thyroid toxicity water relevant suspects were active in a minimum of one and a maximum of 91 assays i e 17alpha estradiol fig s11 the 5th percentile of the toxcast ac50 was determined for each suspect to reduce the potentially disproportionate impact of sensitive assay endpoints predicted suspect concentrations were combined with the 5th percentile ac50 values to calculate a synergistic priority score eq 4 and supplementary file si prioscores rp pos neg hilic xlsx the higher the score the higher the potential risk posed by a suspect priority scores for suspects detected with rp and positive ionization ranged from 308 1 ethyl 2 pyrrolidinone to 1 6 10 6 diphenylamine shown in fig 3 predicted concentrations of the detected suspects ranged from 10 12 to 10 9 m while the 5th percentile of the ac50 values ranged from 10 12 to 10 5 m the ac50 overall affected the priority score more than the detected concentrations in particular because these did not vary greatly between locations and sampling periods for additional information about differences in features between sampling locations and seasons see figs s9 and s10 in the supporting information suspects were often ranked together regardless of their detection in different surface waters and or seasons such as 1 ethyl 2 pyrrolidinone scores from 21 to 309 1 2 3

features in rp positive and negative ionization and hilic should be confirmed in future studies so that current monitoring schemes for polar chemicals which mainly rely on targeted lc ms ms analysis can be expanded to include the newly identified compounds 3 5 toxicity assessment based on structural alerts and qsars priority score based suspect ranking relied on in vitro toxicity data availability in toxcast for 53 suspects detected with rp in positive ionization mode no toxcast data was available therefore an alternative approach based on the presence of structural alerts that could indicate toxicity and qsars was used to assess toxicity 19 suspects comprised one to seven structural alerts supplementary file si toxalerts rppos xlsx a total of 62 structural alerts were detected 10 of which indicated endocrine disruption 7 non genotoxic carcinogenicity and 45 genotoxic carcinogenicity or mutagenicity the threshold of toxicological concern ttc derives target values for drinking water contaminants21 for individual genotoxic and steroid endocrine chemicals at 0 01 μg l and all other organic chemicals at 0 1 μg l as all suspects exhibited a structural alert related to genotoxicity or endocrine disruption a ttc of 0 01 ug l was applied resulting in 16 of the 19 suspects with an alert exceeding the ttc table s3 10 of these suspects were detected with maximum suspect concentration in the keizersveer meuse and rhine sample from september three in the keizersveer meuse and rhine sample from february and three in the haringvliet meuse sample from may in addition experimental toxicity data for the 53 suspects without toxcast data were retrieved using the qsar toolbox suspects were prioritized based on a combined score for both the hazard based on experimental data and profilers and the exposure supplementary file si qsar rppos xlsx 4 methyl 1 2 3 benzotriazole exceeded the signaling value of 1 0 µg l and eight suspects 0 1 µg l table s3 for one of these nine suspects n n dibutylformamide no experimental data was available and the profilers did not show significant hazard despite a medium priority score based on predicted concentration this suspect was thus not prioritized for five suspects i e 1 2 diacetylbenzene 2 methyl 2h benzotriazole metolcarb 4 formylaminoantipyrine and n acetylaminoantipyrine no experimental data was available but possibly hazardous alerts as these suspects exceeded 0 1 µg l they were categorized as medium priority three suspects were categorized high priority as they were found at concentrations exceeding 1 µg l i e 4 methyl 1 2 3 benzotriazole or 0 1 µg l and either exhibited high priority scores based on experimental data i e 1 2 diacetylbenzene high priority scores based on profilers i e 4 methyl 1 2 3 benzotriazole or both i e benalaxyl 4 conclusion nts based identification of unknown features remains time and labor intensive particularly in environmental samples with chemicals present at sub µg l levels in the specific context of large river catchments prior selection and exclusion of compounds based on compiled lists or maps of emission sources is hampered by both the large number of such source and the fragmented information about their emissions it is therefore essential to use comprehensive yet relevant suspect lists when screening for contaminants in such catchments in particular if these are being used for drinking water production findings presented here illustrate that the use of extensive yet relevant suspect lists combined with risk based prioritization workflows is a promising approach to tackle such complexity in particular a risk based prioritization workflow was developed and implemented to select only suspects posing the greatest risk to drinking water and simultaneously allowing to focus future elucidation efforts only on the most relevant compounds regarding development of a risk based monitoring strategy the combination of 1 point calibration target semi quantification and nts in one lc hrms analysis seems promising moreover based on ionization efficiencies the concentrations of suspect chemicals could be predicted in the future a selection of target analyses could therefore become obsolete as quantification of these targets can be integrated into nts workflows in fact after identification newly detected emerging contaminants could be added to the nts based quantification approach presented here furthermore the added value of using complementary chromatographic techniques to conventional rp recently highlighted in the literature was further confirmed in this context in particular a broader range of polarities and hence a larger number of features could be detected by including hilic and mmc

16671,antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and resistance genes args are emerging environmental pollutants with strong pathogenicity in this study surface plasma was developed to inactivate the donor arb with escherichia coli ar e coli as a model eliminate args and inhibit conjugative transfer of args in water highlighting the influences of concomitant inorganic ions surface plasma oxidation significantly inactivated ar e coli eliminated args and inhibited conjugative transfer of args and the presence of no3 cu2 and fe2 all promoted these processes and so4 2 did not have distinct effect approximately 4 5log ar e coli was inactivated within 10 min treatment and it increased to 7 4log ar e coli after adding fe2 integrons inti1 decreased by 3 10log without fe2 and 4 43log adding fe2 the addition of fe2 in the surface plasma induced 99 8 decline in the conjugative transfer frequency the inhibition effects on the conjugative transfer of args were mainly attributed to the reduced reactive oxygen species levels decreased dna damage induced response decreased intercellular contact and down regulated expression of plasmid transfer genes this study disclosed underlying mechanisms for inhibiting args transfer and supplied a prospective technique for args control graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface plasma antibiotic resistance genes antibiotic resistant bacteria inorganic ions conjugative transfer 1 introduction antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args as emerging environmental pollutants have attracted widespread concern due to their huge threats to public health and environmental ecosystems zhu et al 2017 barancheshme and munir 2018 yang et al 2020 at present arb and args are widely found in aquatic systems gao et al 2012 chen et al 2016 wang et al 2019 args can disseminate among bacteria through horizontal gene transfer hgt mechanisms via mobile genetic elements rizzo et al 2013 even from dead to living cells zhang et al 2020 hgt was a major driver for the dissemination of args and competitive bacteria to evolve chen et al 2019 due to transformation transduction and conjugation zhu et al 2017 plasmid mediated conjugation can transfer args between bacteria rizzo et al 2013 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 bacterial conjugation promotes the hgt of genetic materials which is accomplished by direct physical intercellular contact through a pilin bridge generated by the donor cells zhu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 conjugative transfer is quite significant in the dissemination of args in aquatic system some methods have been applied to inactivate arb and remove args including photocatalytic oxidation chen et al 2019 chlorination lu et al 2018 and nanomaterials qiu et al 2012 although these methods realized the reduction of arb and args they could not effectively inhibit conjugative transfer frequency of args and even promoted conjugative transfer between bacteria qiu et al 2012 lu et al 2018 previous study found that the genetic transfer among bacterial cells was usually induced by stressors and the photocatalytic oxidation induced the stressor to promote conjugative transfer of plasmids chen et al 2019 lu et al 2020 also reported that silver nanoparticles promoted the process of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros and dna damage induced response sos thereby enhancing the horizontal transfer of genes therefore it is significant to develop new approaches to reduce the risks of args transfer recently non thermal plasma has attracted wide concern in various bacteria inactivation in water environment helmke et al 2011 guo et al 2013 ji et al 2018 most recent studies mainly concerned the inactivation of ordinary bacteria such as e coli and staphylococcus by plasma treatment unlike ordinary bacteria the args in the arb can still spread among microorganisms through gene transfer although the arb is inactivated even from dead to living cells qiu et al 2012 lu et al 2018 it is worth noting that glow discharge plasma and cold plasma both realized the inactivation of arb and args yang et al 2020 liao et al 2021 however the inactivation of the arb and args by these plasma technologies was triggered in gas phase and some short lived strong reactive species could not effectively diffuse into the liquid phase to react adequately with arb or args besides these recent studies were mainly focused on arb inactivation and args removal performance by different plasma oxidation little has been performed to the conjugative transfer of args information regarding the impacts of plasma treatment on the args conjugative transfer in water environment is still quite lacking let alone the underlying mechanisms of conjugative transfer inorganic ions such as no3 so4 2 cu2 and fe2 usually exist in the natural water sources and some of them could participate in decontamination and disinfection processes zhang et al 2017 cao et al 2019 rommozzi et al 2020 these inorganic ions may also affect the inactivation of arb and transfer of args because some ions are essential elements for bacteria however information regarding the effects of concomitant inorganic ions on arb and args inactivation and conjugative transfer of args induced by plasma oxidation is still lacking in this study surface plasma was applied to inactivate the donor arb with escherichia coli ar e coli as a model eliminate associated args and inhibit conjugative transfer of args in aqueous solutions highlighting the influences of concomitant inorganic ions in the surface plasma various reactive species were produced along the dielectric barrier in the gas phase and then they were poured into the liquid phase through a high speed gas flow thereby improving their mass transfer naturally compared with ordinary plasma the surface plasma had greater performance for typical organic pollutant removal kan et al 2020 wang et al 2021 firstly the effects of inorganic ions including no3 cu2 fe2 and so4 2 on elimination of ar e coli and args were evaluated subsequently the conjugative transfer frequency of args was explored in the presence of these inorganic ions and randomly selected transconjugants were subjected to the minimal inhibited concentration mic finally the underlying mechanisms on conjugative transfer of args in the presence of inorganic ions were investigated it is expected to provide an alternative to reduce the risks of args transfer 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and reagents ar e coli bio 56954 and bio 56937 strains beijing baiou bowei biotechnology co ltd china were separately chosen as the donor and recipient strains respectively the donor strain bio 56954 harbored a plasmid a transferable plasmid of inci1 containing the tetc tetw blatem 1 and aac 3 ii which was resistant to antibiotics gentamicin tetracycline and amoxicillin the recipient strain bio 56937 had higher streptomycin resistance than the donor strain the culture of these two strains was illustrated in text s1 in the supporting information the lipid peroxidation assay kit ros assay kit adenosine triphosphate atp assay kit analytically pure tetracycline amoxicillin and gentamicin were obtained from solarbio science technology co ltd china the chromatographically pure 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxyl temp mannitol and l histidine his were bought from sigma chemical co micro bca protein assay was obtained from beyotime china kit luria bertani lb broth and luria bertani lb ager were bought from beijing land bridge china live dead baclight bacterial viability kit and fastdna spin kit for soil were bought from invitroge usa unless otherwise stated all chemicals were dissolved in the sterile phosphate buffer pbs 2 2 establishment of surface plasma system the experimental setup for elimination of ar e coli and args is shown in figure s1 and the detailed introduction is described in text s2 in a typical batch experiment 500 ml 108 cfu ml 1 ar e coli solution was treated the initial solution ph was 7 4 after inactivation the viable bacteria counts were obtained via plate count method all the experiments were performed in triplicates 2 3 analytical methods after surface plasma treatment the donor ar e coli inactivation performance was determined by the dilution coated plate counting method as calculated in text s3 jiang et al 2017 the energy yield g for ar e coli inactivation was also calculated in test s3 the antibiotic resistance prevalence of the donor strains was assessed by using a broth microdilution method which was evaluated via the minimum inhibitory concentrations mics as depicted in text s4 giannakis et al 2018 the reactive species produced in the surface plasma was monitored using electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker e500 germany liu et al 2021 as depicted in test s4 oh was monitored by fluorescent spectrometry kanazawa et al 2011 the intracellular ros was diagnosed by ros assay kit as described in text s5 catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod activities were extracted from the donor ar e coli yu et al 2020 and calculated in text s5 laser scanning confocal microscopy lscm photographs of the donor ar e coli was obtained by laser confocal scanning microscope fv3000 olympus japan as depicted in text s5 malondialdehyde mda assay kit was used to examine the lipid peroxidation as depicted in text s5 the cellular atp was measured using atp assay kits yu et al 2020 zeta potential and hydrodynamic size were measured using a zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern uk protein and polysaccharide contents were determined by micro bca protein assay kit and phenol sulfuric acid method respectively zuriaga agusti et al 2013 bacterial adhesion was measured as depicted in text s6 no2 was measured using griess reagents xu et al 2017 the changes of args including tetc tetw blatem 1 aac 3 ii and integron inti1 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr as illustrated in text s7 the primers for qpcr are listed in table s1 there were differences in gene expression profiles between the experimental group and the control group in the rna seq data analysis figure s2 the conjugative transfer frequency of args was calculated in text s8 to prove whether the recipient resistance gene was transferred to the donor bacteria the numbers of streptomycin resistant e coli bio56937 before and after the horizontal gene transfer are shown in figure s3 to verify the accuracy of the plate counting method the copy numbers of specific genes in transconjugants after gene transfer were monitored and shown in figure s4 all treatments were conducted in triplicate and the results are the mean standard deviation spss 2 0 was used to perform statistical tests significant differences were analyzed by an one way anova with tukey hsd post hoc test after testing for normality and equal variance significant difference was considered at p 0 05 level pearson correlation coefficient was conducted to investigate the correlation in the inactivation effect and antibiotic resistance and the correlation coefficients among various ar e coli inactivation parameters 3 results and discussion prior to ar e coli inactivation by surface plasma experiments in which ar e coli strains were only exposed to different inorganic ions with various initial concentrations were performed as shown in figure s5 no inactivation performance was observed in the presence of no3 cu2 fe2 and so4 2 respectively these results demonstrated that these inorganic ions in the selected range did not affect ar e coli inactivation p 0 05 prior to evaluate the effects of inorganic ions on ar e coli inactivation the effects of applied voltage and air flow rate on the ar e coli inactivation were investigated without adding inorganic ions and the results are shown in figure s6 the ar e coli inactivation efficiency gradually increased with the increasing of the voltage and air flow rate the generation of the reactive species by the surface plasma was positively correlated with the voltage li et al 2020 and thus higher voltage promoted the inactivation of bacteria dolezalova and et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 additionally the air provided the source of the production of the reactive species and the air flow rate was conducive to the diffusion of the reactive species into the liquid phase favoring the inactivation of ar e coli toyokawa et al 2017 3 1 effects of inorganic ions on ar e coli inactivation inorganic ions generally exist in the natural aquatic environment and play important roles in the decontamination and disinfection processes zhang et al 2017 rommozzi et al 2020 the effects of various inorganic ions on ar e coli inactivation are shown in fig 1a e fig 1a depicts the ar e coli inactivation performance and the pseudo first order kinetic in the surface plasma process in the presence of no3 the ar e coli inactivation performance increased with the no3 concentration in the selected range approximately 4 5log ar e coli was inactivated after 10 min plasma sterilization without no3 addition and it increased to 5 5log 6 2log and 7 1log at the same inactivation time when the no3 concentration was 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 mmol l 1 respectively p 0 05 correspondingly the inactivation reaction rate constant was also significantly enhanced after adding no3 inset in fig 1a p 0 05 katsumura et al 2012 found that oxidizing species oh was generated when no3 was exposed to ultraviolet irradiation reactions 1 2 in the surface plasma process ultraviolet irradiation was also commonly observed oh formation in the surface plasma process after adding different amounts of no3 was detected as shown in fig 1e clearly the relative content of oh increased with the increase in the no3 concentration p 0 05 thus the enhanced ar e coli inactivation performance due to no3 could be attributed to the accelerated formation of oh it should be noted that no3 can react with oh to form no3 reaction 3 whereas the oxidizing capacity of no3 2 30 2 60 v is lower than that of oh xiao et al 2015 therefore attention should be paid to the no3 concentration when it is used to adjust ar e coli inactivation in the surface plasma process rommozzi et al 2020 reported that no3 at environmental concentrations had a potential to enhance bacterial disinfection in the photo fenton system additional oh could be produced at a low quantum yield via direct photolysis of no3 reactions 1 2 keen et al 2012 serna galvis et al 2019 found that the photo excitation of no3 by sunlight produced oh which favored disinfection 1 n o 3 hv o no 2 2 o h 2 o 2 oh 3 n o 3 oh h 2 o no 3 fig 1b and c depict the evolution of the donor ar e coli inactivation performance at various cu2 and fe2 concentrations obviously the presence of cu2 and fe2 both significantly promoted the ar e coli inactivation in the surface plasma treatment process and these promotion effects were positively related with the cu2 and fe2 concentrations when 1 0 mmol l 1 cu2 and fe2 was added the inactivation performance increased to 7 0log and 7 4log after 10 min treatment respectively p 0 05 previous study found that fe2 could promote the inactivation of e coli due to the fenton reactions of fe2 with hydrogen peroxide reactions 4 5 spuhler et al 2010 the relative content of oh obviously increased after adding fe2 fig 1e p 0 05 simultaneously fe2 was able to diffuse into the cells of strains leading to increase in the formation of oh via intercellular fenton like reactions when reacting with metabolic h2o2 imlay 2008 fe3 could be adsorbed or absorbed on proteins of the bacterial membrane leading to the formation of fe3 bacteria exciplexes the formed exciplexes then probably resulted in direct oxidation of the membrane and initiation of lipid peroxidation chains ruales lonfat et al 2014 jiménez et al 2020 also found that notable bacterial inactivation was obtained in both batch and continuous flow modes by iron ions in a fenton oxidation system similar with fe2 and cu2 can also induce the decomposition of h2o2 to generate oh reactions 6 7 causing inactivation of microbial cells volentini et al 2011 nguyen et al 2013 oh could promote the inactivation of bacteria by destructing cell membranes helmke et al 2011 in addition intracellular oh could inactivate catalase enzyme and denature dna and rna toyokawa et al 2017 huang et al 2019 found that fe2 could reduce the activity of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase for atp production thereby promoting the cell inactivation effect 4 h2o2 fe2 oh oh fe3 5 h2o2 fe3 h ho2 fe2 6 cu2 h2o2 cu o2 2h 7 cu h2o2 cu2 oh oh the effect of so4 2 on the inactivation efficiency of ar e coli in the plasma process is shown in fig 1d similar with the inactivation efficiency there was no significant difference in the reaction rate constants before and after so4 2 addition p 0 05 oh formation was also not promoted by the addition of so4 2 fig 1e as expected the presence of so4 2 had a negligible effect on the inactivation efficiency therefore the effect of so4 2 was no longer concerned in the later experiments the promoted inactivation performance in the presence of no3 cu2 and fe2 could also be confirmed by the changes in the laser scanning confocal microscopy of ar e coli figure s7 arb inactivation performance in liquid phase by different techniques was compared and the results are listed in table s2 comparable arb inactivation efficiencies were obtained by photoelectrocatalytic oxidation photo fenton oxidation and electrochemical oxidation within 30 120 min but the energy yield of these methods was lower than that of the present plasma xiong et al 2015 liang et al 2018 ahmed et al 2020 relatively weaker arb inactivation performances and lower energy yield were gained by the ultraviolet irradiation ultraviolet tio2 and atmospheric cold plasma compared with those of the present plasma chen et al 2019 xiong and hu 2013 liao et al 2021 summarily relatively shorter treatment time higher arb inactivation efficiency and more economical energy cost were gained in the surface plasma 3 2 effects of inorganic ions on args elimination the relative abundances of five args including tetc tetw blatem 1 aac 3 ii and the integrons inti1 were examined before and after the surface plasma treatment in the presence of different inorganic ions as shown in fig 2 the copy numbers of tetc tetw blatem 1 and aac 3 ii decreased by 0 34log 0 41log 3 41log and 2 94 log after 10 min surface plasma treatment p 0 05 it is very interesting that the integrons inti1 gene an indicator of horizontal gene transfer of args chen and zhang 2013 also decreased by 3 10log after 10 min treatment p 0 05 indicating that the surface plasma treatment could inhibit transfer of args furthermore the args elimination performances of tetw blatem 1 aac 3 ii and inti1 were all promoted in the presence of no3 p 0 05 except tetc the elimination performances of all the selected args were noticeably promoted in the presence of fe2 and cu2 especially in the presence of fe2 p 0 05 the relative abundances of tetc tetw blatem 1 aac 3 ii and the integrons inti1 decreased by 0 82log 1 49log 4 23log 4 00log and 4 43log in the presence of fe2 this could be attributed to the highest oh production in this case fig 1e the changes in args during plasma treatment process was consistent with those of arb indicating that args were associated with reduced microbial population mosteo et al 2020 in addition the presence of inorganic ions also further induced the reduction of antibiotic resistance of arb the mic values of ar e coli to amoxicillin tetracycline and gentamicin all decreased by 50 after 10 min surface plasma treatment p 0 05 as shown in fig 3 these mic values of ar e coli to amoxicillin tetracycline and gentamicin further decreased by 87 5 75 and 75 after 10 min treatment in the presence of fe2 p 0 05 respectively the resistance of donor ar e coli was significantly reduced by the surface plasma treatment in the presence of inorganic ions p 0 05 which was consistent with the results of args jiang et al 2017 reported that ros modified the outer membrane of the bacteria and the affinity of the antibiotics to the target lipid and thus increasing the penetration of the antibiotics through the cell membrane and reducing cell resistance the typical epr signals of the short life species are depicted in fig 4 a and b oh and 1o2 were detected and their epr intensities decreased in the pbs solution containing ar e coli these findings confirmed that oh and 1o2 participated in ar e coli inactivation and args elimination process mannitol and l histidine were used as scavengers of oh and 1o2 in the system containing bacteria respectively to further confirm the contributions of oh and 1o2 tong et al 2018 song et al 2019 as shown in fig 4c and d the reaction rate constant k gradually decreased with the increasing of these two scavengers specifically the k value significantly decreased from 0 525 to 0 178 min 1 with the l histidine concentration increased from 0 to 90 μmol l 1 p 0 05 similarly the k value decreased from 0 525 to 0 313 min 1 with the mannitol concentration increased from 0 to 400 mmol l 1 p 0 05 these results further suggested that oh and 1o2 in the plasma system made great contributions to the arb inactivation process the reactive species including oh and 1o2 induced by the plasma could attack the bacterial structures cell membrane protein and dna via various pathways which resulted in the inactivation of bacteria machala et al 2013 lu et al 2016 in previous study the damage of cell membrane the leakage of intracellular substances and the decomposition of base pairs of dna were observed during ar e coli inactivation by the ros oxidation song et al 2021 3 3 effects of inorganic ions on conjugative transfer of args the transconjugant was an indicator of conjugative transfer huang et al 2019 fig 5 a depicts the changes in the number of the transconjugants in different conditions compared with untreated sample the number of transconjugants was significantly reduced by 67 2 after 10 min surface plasma treatment p 0 05 the addition of inorganic ions fe2 and cu2 promoted the decrease of the transconjugants p 0 05 except no3 addition the number of transconjugants decreased by 90 1 after 10 min surface plasma treatment in the presence of fe2 p 0 05 moreover the conjugative transfer frequency decreased from initial 1 3 10 6 to 1 3 10 7 after 10 min surface plasma treatment p 0 05 fig 5b and it further decreased in the presence of fe2 and cu2 p 0 05 except no3 the addition of fe2 in the surface plasma process induced 99 8 decline in the conjugative transfer frequency these results demonstrated that the conjugative transfer of args was inhibited by the surface plasma treatment which was further inhibited by the addition of organic ions two main factors affecting bacterial horizontal gene transfer were the abundance of bacteria and conjugative transfer frequency guo et al 2015 lin et al 2016 su et al 2019 low bacterial density disfavored the conjugative transfer qiu et al 2012 these results suggested that the surface plasma treatment could inhibit the hgt of args by reducing the number of donor bacteria and conjugative transfer frequency and these actions were strengthened by the addition of inorganic ions nitrous acid inhibited more than 90 of plasmid conjugative transfer by decreasing the initial cell density huang et al 2019 lin et al 2016 reported that the reduced number of donor cells after ultraviolet and chlorine treatment decreased the conjugative transfer frequency for conjugation occurring in liquid environment collide attach and conjugate were necessary zhong et al 2010 the conjugative transfer may be regulated by the sos response cell membrane permeability intercellular adhesion and energy supply maiques et al 2006 liao et al 2019 wang et al 2019 which will be discussed in the following sections 3 4 possible mechanisms of inhibited conjugative transfer of args 3 4 1 sos response previous studies reported that oxidative stress was one of the key signal molecules of bacterial conjugative transfer maiques et al 2006 liao et al 2019 wang et al 2019 effects of inorganic ions addition on the oxidative stress response in ar e coli during the surface plasma processing were evaluated as shown in fig 6 the level of intracellular ros was significantly reduced after 10 min surface plasma treatment p 0 05 and it further decreased in the presence of inorganic ions fe2 no3 and cu2 p 0 05 fig 6a the minimum ros level was observed in the presence of fe2 and there was a 42 2 decline in the intracellular ros level compared with single plasma treatment the conjugative transfer of plasmid was suppressed due to the reduction of oxidative stress and sos response yu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 found that excessive accumulation of ros damaged the cell membrane weakened the important barriers of cells and made them more permeable to the transfer of genetic materials thereby promoting the frequency of args conjugative transfer yu et al 2021 reported that the binding of args was inhibited due to the elimination of excessive intracellular ros by ceo2 nano particles thereby inhibiting the conjugative transfer to reveal the effect of the intracellular ros on the conjugative transfer thiourea was selected as a typical scavenger of ros lu et al 2020 after adding ros scavenger thiourea the conjugative transfer frequency of args was significantly reduced regardless of the presence of inorganic ions fig 5b these results suggested that the decreased ros level indeed induced reduction of conjugative transfer wang et al 2019 also found that the conjugative transfer frequency was significantly reduced when ros scavengers were added during the mating period compared with the control the expression of genes related to sos response lexa and sula and dna repair umuc and umud was significantly down regulated after 10 min surface plasma treatment fig 6b the addition of fe2 further induced the down regulation of expression of genes related to sos response and dna repair therefore the presence of fe2 in the surface plasma system further inhibited the sos response and dna repair of the donor ar e coli reducing the hgt the activities of sod and cat are shown in fig 6c clearly the sod and cat activities decreased after 10 min surface plasma treatment and the presence of fe2 and cu2 further decreased their activities p 0 05 furthermore the genes sodb sodc kate and katg encoding sod and cat activities were down regulated after plasma treatment especially in the presence of fe2 fig 6b it should be noted that the cat and sod as the antioxidative enzymes could scavenge the intracellular ros this action was related with the plasma treatment time guo et al 2017 song et al 2021 under a low exposure time the intracellular ros could trigger bacterial oxidative stress responses and the activities of cat and sod increased to alleviate ros damage under a relatively longer plasma exposure time the sod and cat would be inactivated by the plasma oxidation and bacteria would also be inactivated leading to the decrease in the sod and cat guo et al 2017 the pearson correlation analysis showed that there were significant correlations among conjugative transfer frequency ros level and sod and cat activities table s3 from these phenotypic and genotypic results the surface plasma treatment reduced the conjugative transfer of args due to the decrease in the sos response in the ar e coli strains lu et al 2020 3 4 2 cell membrane permeability the cell membrane integrity was examined via laser scanning confocal microscopy lscm and mda analysis as depicted in figure s7 and fig 7 a before the surface plasma treatment the donor ar e coli cells maintained complete green fluorescence figure s7a a dense population of red fluorescent cells was observed after exposure to plasma for 10 min and more cells with red fluorescent were observed in the presence of inorganic ions especially for fe2 addition figure s7d mda is a typical product of cell membrane lipid oxidation and there is a positive correlation between the content of mda and cell membrane destruction ji et al 2018 compared with the control the concentration of mda increased significantly after 10 min surface plasma treatment and the highest mda concentration was observed after adding fe2 fig 7a p 0 05 indicating that strongest oxidative damages occurred to the donor ar e coli in this case the expression levels of genes related with cell member were evaluated as shown in fig 7b the genes slyb yoaf and yoak coding for outer membrane proteins β barrel protein regulator genes ompc and ompf and osmotic genes osmb and osmc were up regulated after 10 min surface plasma treatment and their expression levels were further up regulated after adding fe2 these results further proved that the cell membrane permeability of the donors was promoted after plasma treatment although the presence of inorganic ions in the plasma process promoted the permeability of cell membranes the transfer of genes between bacteria was inhibited the pearson correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between conjugative transfer frequency and mda table s3 the plasma could directly penetrate and break the cell walls destroyed the cell membrane integrity and cellular culturability leading to the decrease in the number of donor bacteria the concentration of plasmids and args abundances these changes contributed to inhibit the conjugative transfer of args mychack et al 2019 3 4 3 intercellular adhesion the prerequisite for conjugative transfer is intercellular contact between bacteria more et al 2014 extracellular polymeric substance eps was an important part of microbial ecology flemming and wingender 2010 fig 8 a depicts the changes of the ratio of proteins to polysaccharide pn ps and adhesion between bacteria cells the pn ps and adhesion significantly decreased after 10 min plasma treatment and they further decreased in the presence of fe2 and cu2 p 0 05 there were 53 4 and 56 5 declines in the pn ps and adhesion in the presence of fe2 p 0 05 respectively furthermore putative protein export and polysaccharide export related genes in the donor bacteria including tatb sece secg lptc and lptf were down regulated after plasma treatment which were further down regulated after adding fe2 fig 8b these findings demonstrated that plasma treatment mediated the interaction between cells by changing the content of extracellular polysaccharides and proteins especially after adding some inorganic ions previous study reported that ros acted as a secondary signal messenger of metabolism and low ros resulted in a decrease in the amount of eps han et al 2019 eps composition played an important role in cell surface characteristics mainly by changing the hydrophobicity thereby affecting cell adhesion tsuneda et al 2003 the zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of the donor ar e coli cells both decreased after the surface plasma treatment and the addition of no3 cu2 and fe2 further promoted these processes figure s8 p 0 05 the pearson correlation analysis showed that there were significant correlations among conjugative transfer frequency adhesion and eps table s3 therefore the reduction in the adhesion and eps induced by the surface plasma treatment contributed to inhibit conjugative transfer of args 3 4 4 energy driving force dna transfer and morphogenesis induction of conjugation machines consume energy lu et al 2018 fig 8c depicts the effects of various inorganic ions on atp content of the donor ar e coli during the plasma treatment process compared with the control the atp content decreased by 61 7 after 10 min plasma treatment the addition of no3 fe2 and cu2 further reduced atp content by 76 6 88 5 and 85 4 respectively p 0 05 in the plasma process nitrite could be produced due to nitrogen ionization its content gradually increased with the plasma treatment figure s9 previous studies reported that the no2 could combine with proteins to form complexes which then prevented the degradation of acetone into atp no2 also affected the stability of the energy charge and electron transport chain thereby influencing bacterial atp production and gene expression cunningham bussel et al 2013 komirishetty et al 2017 aryannejad et al 2021 furthermore the transcription levels of atp encoding genes atpb and atpi regulating cellular energy production were down regulated after the plasma treatment and further down regulated in the presence of fe2 fig 8b atp was one of the limiting factors for conjugation of args aghdam et al 2018 lu et al 2018 reported that atp content significantly decreased in bacteria by free nitrous acid which then affected conjugative transfer the pearson correlation analysis in table s3 showed that there was a significantly positive correlation between conjugative transfer frequency and atp these results manifested that inhibited metabolism and available energy occurred in the donor ar e coli after plasma treatment thereby inhibiting the conjugative transfer of args 4 conclusions the potential effects of inorganic ions on inactivation of donor arb args elimination and conjugative transfer of args in a surface plasma system were explored the presence of no3 cu2 and fe2 greatly enhanced the elimination of arb and args via promoting the generation of oh except so4 2 more importantly conjugative transfer of args was significantly inhibited by the surface plasma especially in the presence of fe2 accompanied by dramatic decrease in the number of transconjugants analysis on intracellular ros sos response intercellular contact and energy driving force demonstrated that the expression of sos response genes dna repair genes eps related genes and atp synthesis genes was depressed by the plasma oxidation these changes finally resulted in inhibition of conjugative transfer of args this study provided an option for args control via inhibiting its conjugative transfer further study should be

16671,antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and resistance genes args are emerging environmental pollutants with strong pathogenicity in this study surface plasma was developed to inactivate the donor arb with escherichia coli ar e coli as a model eliminate args and inhibit conjugative transfer of args in water highlighting the influences of concomitant inorganic ions surface plasma oxidation significantly inactivated ar e coli eliminated args and inhibited conjugative transfer of args and the presence of no3 cu2 and fe2 all promoted these processes and so4 2 did not have distinct effect approximately 4 5log ar e coli was inactivated within 10 min treatment and it increased to 7 4log ar e coli after adding fe2 integrons inti1 decreased by 3 10log without fe2 and 4 43log adding fe2 the addition of fe2 in the surface plasma induced 99 8 decline in the conjugative transfer frequency the inhibition effects on the conjugative transfer of args were mainly attributed to the reduced reactive oxygen species levels decreased dna damage induced response decreased intercellular contact and down regulated expression of plasmid transfer genes this study disclosed underlying mechanisms for inhibiting args transfer and supplied a prospective technique for args control graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface plasma antibiotic resistance genes antibiotic resistant bacteria inorganic ions conjugative transfer 1 introduction antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args as emerging environmental pollutants have attracted widespread concern due to their huge threats to public health and environmental ecosystems zhu et al 2017 barancheshme and munir 2018 yang et al 2020 at present arb and args are widely found in aquatic systems gao et al 2012 chen et al 2016 wang et al 2019 args can disseminate among bacteria through horizontal gene transfer hgt mechanisms via mobile genetic elements rizzo et al 2013 even from dead to living cells zhang et al 2020 hgt was a major driver for the dissemination of args and competitive bacteria to evolve chen et al 2019 due to transformation transduction and conjugation zhu et al 2017 plasmid mediated conjugation can transfer args between bacteria rizzo et al 2013 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 bacterial conjugation promotes the hgt of genetic materials which is accomplished by direct physical intercellular contact through a pilin bridge generated by the donor cells zhu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 conjugative transfer is quite significant in the dissemination of args in aquatic system some methods have been applied to inactivate arb and remove args including photocatalytic oxidation chen et al 2019 chlorination lu et al 2018 and nanomaterials qiu et al 2012 although these methods realized the reduction of arb and args they could not effectively inhibit conjugative transfer frequency of args and even promoted conjugative transfer between bacteria qiu et al 2012 lu et al 2018 previous study found that the genetic transfer among bacterial cells was usually induced by stressors and the photocatalytic oxidation induced the stressor to promote conjugative transfer of plasmids chen et al 2019 lu et al 2020 also reported that silver nanoparticles promoted the process of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros and dna damage induced response sos thereby enhancing the horizontal transfer of genes therefore it is significant to develop new approaches to reduce the risks of args transfer recently non thermal plasma has attracted wide concern in various bacteria inactivation in water environment helmke et al 2011 guo et al 2013 ji et al 2018 most recent studies mainly concerned the inactivation of ordinary bacteria such as e coli and staphylococcus by plasma treatment unlike ordinary bacteria the args in the arb can still spread among microorganisms through gene transfer although the arb is inactivated even from dead to living cells qiu et al 2012 lu et al 2018 it is worth noting that glow discharge plasma and cold plasma both realized the inactivation of arb and args yang et al 2020 liao et al 2021 however the inactivation of the arb and args by these plasma technologies was triggered in gas phase and some short lived strong reactive species could not effectively diffuse into the liquid phase to react adequately with arb or args besides these recent studies were mainly focused on arb inactivation and args removal performance by different plasma oxidation little has been performed to the conjugative transfer of args information regarding the impacts of plasma treatment on the args conjugative transfer in water environment is still quite lacking let alone the underlying mechanisms of conjugative transfer inorganic ions such as no3 so4 2 cu2 and fe2 usually exist in the natural water sources and some of them could participate in decontamination and disinfection processes zhang et al 2017 cao et al 2019 rommozzi et al 2020 these inorganic ions may also affect the inactivation of arb and transfer of args because some ions are essential elements for bacteria however information regarding the effects of concomitant inorganic ions on arb and args inactivation and conjugative transfer of args induced by plasma oxidation is still lacking in this study surface plasma was applied to inactivate the donor arb with escherichia coli ar e coli as a model eliminate associated args and inhibit conjugative transfer of args in aqueous solutions highlighting the influences of concomitant inorganic ions in the surface plasma various reactive species were produced along the dielectric barrier in the gas phase and then they were poured into the liquid phase through a high speed gas flow thereby improving their mass transfer naturally compared with ordinary plasma the surface plasma had greater performance for typical organic pollutant removal kan et al 2020 wang et al 2021 firstly the effects of inorganic ions including no3 cu2 fe2 and so4 2 on elimination of ar e coli and args were evaluated subsequently the conjugative transfer frequency of args was explored in the presence of these inorganic ions and randomly selected transconjugants were subjected to the minimal inhibited concentration mic finally the underlying mechanisms on conjugative transfer of args in the presence of inorganic ions were investigated it is expected to provide an alternative to reduce the risks of args transfer 2 material and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and reagents ar e coli bio 56954 and bio 56937 strains beijing baiou bowei biotechnology co ltd china were separately chosen as the donor and recipient strains respectively the donor strain bio 56954 harbored a plasmid a transferable plasmid of inci1 containing the tetc tetw blatem 1 and aac 3 ii which was resistant to antibiotics gentamicin tetracycline and amoxicillin the recipient strain bio 56937 had higher streptomycin resistance than the donor strain the culture of these two strains was illustrated in text s1 in the supporting information the lipid peroxidation assay kit ros assay kit adenosine triphosphate atp assay kit analytically pure tetracycline amoxicillin and gentamicin were obtained from solarbio science technology co ltd china the chromatographically pure 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine 1 oxyl temp mannitol and l histidine his were bought from sigma chemical co micro bca protein assay was obtained from beyotime china kit luria bertani lb broth and luria bertani lb ager were bought from beijing land bridge china live dead baclight bacterial viability kit and fastdna spin kit for soil were bought from invitroge usa unless otherwise stated all chemicals were dissolved in the sterile phosphate buffer pbs 2 2 establishment of surface plasma system the experimental setup for elimination of ar e coli and args is shown in figure s1 and the detailed introduction is described in text s2 in a typical batch experiment 500 ml 108 cfu ml 1 ar e coli solution was treated the initial solution ph was 7 4 after inactivation the viable bacteria counts were obtained via plate count method all the experiments were performed in triplicates 2 3 analytical methods after surface plasma treatment the donor ar e coli inactivation performance was determined by the dilution coated plate counting method as calculated in text s3 jiang et al 2017 the energy yield g for ar e coli inactivation was also calculated in test s3 the antibiotic resistance prevalence of the donor strains was assessed by using a broth microdilution method which was evaluated via the minimum inhibitory concentrations mics as depicted in text s4 giannakis et al 2018 the reactive species produced in the surface plasma was monitored using electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker e500 germany liu et al 2021 as depicted in test s4 oh was monitored by fluorescent spectrometry kanazawa et al 2011 the intracellular ros was diagnosed by ros assay kit as described in text s5 catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod activities were extracted from the donor ar e coli yu et al 2020 and calculated in text s5 laser scanning confocal microscopy lscm photographs of the donor ar e coli was obtained by laser confocal scanning microscope fv3000 olympus japan as depicted in text s5 malondialdehyde mda assay kit was used to examine the lipid peroxidation as depicted in text s5 the cellular atp was measured using atp assay kits yu et al 2020 zeta potential and hydrodynamic size were measured using a zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern uk protein and polysaccharide contents were determined by micro bca protein assay kit and phenol sulfuric acid method respectively zuriaga agusti et al 2013 bacterial adhesion was measured as depicted in text s6 no2 was measured using griess reagents xu et al 2017 the changes of args including tetc tetw blatem 1 aac 3 ii and integron inti1 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr as illustrated in text s7 the primers for qpcr are listed in table s1 there were differences in gene expression profiles between the experimental group and the control group in the rna seq data analysis figure s2 the conjugative transfer frequency of args was calculated in text s8 to prove whether the recipient resistance gene was transferred to the donor bacteria the numbers of streptomycin resistant e coli bio56937 before and after the horizontal gene transfer are shown in figure s3 to verify the accuracy of the plate counting method the copy numbers of specific genes in transconjugants after gene transfer were monitored and shown in figure s4 all treatments were conducted in triplicate and the results are the mean standard deviation spss 2 0 was used to perform statistical tests significant differences were analyzed by an one way anova with tukey hsd post hoc test after testing for normality and equal variance significant difference was considered at p 0 05 level pearson correlation coefficient was conducted to investigate the correlation in the inactivation effect and antibiotic resistance and the correlation coefficients among various ar e coli inactivation parameters 3 results and discussion prior to ar e coli inactivation by surface plasma experiments in which ar e coli strains were only exposed to different inorganic ions with various initial concentrations were performed as shown in figure s5 no inactivation performance was observed in the presence of no3 cu2 fe2 and so4 2 respectively these results demonstrated that these inorganic ions in the selected range did not affect ar e coli inactivation p 0 05 prior to evaluate the effects of inorganic ions on ar e coli inactivation the effects of applied voltage and air flow rate on the ar e coli inactivation were investigated without adding inorganic ions and the results are shown in figure s6 the ar e coli inactivation efficiency gradually increased with the increasing of the voltage and air flow rate the generation of the reactive species by the surface plasma was positively correlated with the voltage li et al 2020 and thus higher voltage promoted the inactivation of bacteria dolezalova and et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 additionally the air provided the source of the production of the reactive species and the air flow rate was conducive to the diffusion of the reactive species into the liquid phase favoring the inactivation of ar e coli toyokawa et al 2017 3 1 effects of inorganic ions on ar e coli inactivation inorganic ions generally exist in the natural aquatic environment and play important roles in the decontamination and disinfection processes zhang et al 2017 rommozzi et al 2020 the effects of various inorganic ions on ar e coli inactivation are shown in fig 1a e fig 1a depicts the ar e coli inactivation performance and the pseudo first order kinetic in the surface plasma process in the presence of no3 the ar e coli inactivation performance increased with the no3 concentration in the selected range approximately 4 5log ar e coli was inactivated after 10 min plasma sterilization without no3 addition and it increased to 5 5log 6 2log and 7 1log at the same inactivation time when the no3 concentration was 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 mmol l 1 respectively p 0 05 correspondingly the inactivation reaction rate constant was also significantly enhanced after adding no3 inset in fig 1a p 0 05 katsumura et al 2012 found that oxidizing species oh was generated when no3 was exposed to ultraviolet irradiation reactions 1 2 in the surface plasma process ultraviolet irradiation was also commonly observed oh formation in the surface plasma process after adding different amounts of no3 was detected as shown in fig 1e clearly the relative content of oh increased with the increase in the no3 concentration p 0 05 thus the enhanced ar e coli inactivation performance due to no3 could be attributed to the accelerated formation of oh it should be noted that no3 can react with oh to form no3 reaction 3 whereas the oxidizing capacity of no3 2 30 2 60 v is lower than that of oh xiao et al 2015 therefore attention should be paid to the no3 concentration when it is used to adjust ar e coli inactivation in the surface plasma process rommozzi et al 2020 reported that no3 at environmental concentrations had a potential to enhance bacterial disinfection in the photo fenton system additional oh could be produced at a low quantum yield via direct photolysis of no3 reactions 1 2 keen et al 2012 serna galvis et al 2019 found that the photo excitation of no3 by sunlight produced oh which favored disinfection 1 n o 3 hv o no 2 2 o h 2 o 2 oh 3 n o 3 oh h 2 o no 3 fig 1b and c depict the evolution of the donor ar e coli inactivation performance at various cu2 and fe2 concentrations obviously the presence of cu2 and fe2 both significantly promoted the ar e coli inactivation in the surface plasma treatment process and these promotion effects were positively related with the cu2 and fe2 concentrations when 1 0 mmol l 1 cu2 and fe2 was added the inactivation performance increased to 7 0log and 7 4log after 10 min treatment respectively p 0 05 previous study found that fe2 could promote the inactivation of e coli due to the fenton reactions of fe2 with hydrogen peroxide reactions 4 5 spuhler et al 2010 the relative content of oh obviously increased after adding fe2 fig 1e p 0 05 simultaneously fe2 was able to diffuse into the cells of strains leading to increase in the formation of oh via intercellular fenton like reactions when reacting with metabolic h2o2 imlay 2008 fe3 could be adsorbed or absorbed on proteins of the bacterial membrane leading to the formation of fe3 bacteria exciplexes the formed exciplexes then probably resulted in direct oxidation of the membrane and initiation of lipid peroxidation chains ruales lonfat et al 2014 jiménez et al 2020 also found that notable bacterial inactivation was obtained in both batch and continuous flow modes by iron ions in a fenton oxidation system similar with fe2 and cu2 can also induce the decomposition of h2o2 to generate oh reactions 6 7 causing inactivation of microbial cells volentini et al 2011 nguyen et al 2013 oh could promote the inactivation of bacteria by destructing cell membranes helmke et al 2011 in addition intracellular oh could inactivate catalase enzyme and denature dna and rna toyokawa et al 2017 huang et al 2019 found that fe2 could reduce the activity of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase for atp production thereby promoting the cell inactivation effect 4 h2o2 fe2 oh oh fe3 5 h2o2 fe3 h ho2 fe2 6 cu2 h2o2 cu o2 2h 7 cu h2o2 cu2 oh oh the effect of so4 2 on the inactivation efficiency of ar e coli in the plasma process is shown in fig 1d similar with the inactivation efficiency there was no significant difference in the reaction rate constants before and after so4 2 addition p 0 05 oh formation was also not promoted by the addition of so4 2 fig 1e as expected the presence of so4 2 had a negligible effect on the inactivation efficiency therefore the effect of so4 2 was no longer concerned in the later experiments the promoted inactivation performance in the presence of no3 cu2 and fe2 could also be confirmed by the changes in the laser scanning confocal microscopy of ar e coli figure s7 arb inactivation performance in liquid phase by different techniques was compared and the results are listed in table s2 comparable arb inactivation efficiencies were obtained by photoelectrocatalytic oxidation photo fenton oxidation and electrochemical oxidation within 30 120 min but the energy yield of these methods was lower than that of the present plasma xiong et al 2015 liang et al 2018 ahmed et al 2020 relatively weaker arb inactivation performances and lower energy yield were gained by the ultraviolet irradiation ultraviolet tio2 and atmospheric cold plasma compared with those of the present plasma chen et al 2019 xiong and hu 2013 liao et al 2021 summarily relatively shorter treatment time higher arb inactivation efficiency and more economical energy cost were gained in the surface plasma 3 2 effects of inorganic ions on args elimination the relative abundances of five args including tetc tetw blatem 1 aac 3 ii and the integrons inti1 were examined before and after the surface plasma treatment in the presence of different inorganic ions as shown in fig 2 the copy numbers of tetc tetw blatem 1 and aac 3 ii decreased by 0 34log 0 41log 3 41log and 2 94 log after 10 min surface plasma treatment p 0 05 it is very interesting that the integrons inti1 gene an indicator of horizontal gene transfer of args chen and zhang 2013 also decreased by 3 10log after 10 min treatment p 0 05 indicating that the surface plasma treatment could inhibit transfer of args furthermore the args elimination performances of tetw blatem 1 aac 3 ii and inti1 were all promoted in the presence of no3 p 0 05 except tetc the elimination performances of all the selected args were noticeably promoted in the presence of fe2 and cu2 especially in the presence of fe2 p 0 05 the relative abundances of tetc tetw blatem 1 aac 3 ii and the integrons inti1 decreased by 0 82log 1 49log 4 23log 4 00log and 4 43log in the presence of fe2 this could be attributed to the highest oh production in this case fig 1e the changes in args during plasma treatment process was consistent with those of arb indicating that args were associated with reduced microbial population mosteo et al 2020 in addition the presence of inorganic ions also further induced the reduction of antibiotic resistance of arb the mic values of ar e coli to amoxicillin tetracycline and gentamicin all decreased by 50 after 10 min surface plasma treatment p 0 05 as shown in fig 3 these mic values of ar e coli to amoxicillin tetracycline and gentamicin further decreased by 87 5 75 and 75 after 10 min treatment in the presence of fe2 p 0 05 respectively the resistance of donor ar e coli was significantly reduced by the surface plasma treatment in the presence of inorganic ions p 0 05 which was consistent with the results of args jiang et al 2017 reported that ros modified the outer membrane of the bacteria and the affinity of the antibiotics to the target lipid and thus increasing the penetration of the antibiotics through the cell membrane and reducing cell resistance the typical epr signals of the short life species are depicted in fig 4 a and b oh and 1o2 were detected and their epr intensities decreased in the pbs solution containing ar e coli these findings confirmed that oh and 1o2 participated in ar e coli inactivation and args elimination process mannitol and l histidine were used as scavengers of oh and 1o2 in the system containing bacteria respectively to further confirm the contributions of oh and 1o2 tong et al 2018 song et al 2019 as shown in fig 4c and d the reaction rate constant k gradually decreased with the increasing of these two scavengers specifically the k value significantly decreased from 0 525 to 0 178 min 1 with the l histidine concentration increased from 0 to 90 μmol l 1 p 0 05 similarly the k value decreased from 0 525 to 0 313 min 1 with the mannitol concentration increased from 0 to 400 mmol l 1 p 0 05 these results further suggested that oh and 1o2 in the plasma system made great contributions to the arb inactivation process the reactive species including oh and 1o2 induced by the plasma could attack the bacterial structures cell membrane protein and dna via various pathways which resulted in the inactivation of bacteria machala et al 2013 lu et al 2016 in previous study the damage of cell membrane the leakage of intracellular substances and the decomposition of base pairs of dna were observed during ar e coli inactivation by the ros oxidation song et al 2021 3 3 effects of inorganic ions on conjugative transfer of args the transconjugant was an indicator of conjugative transfer huang et al 2019 fig 5 a depicts the changes in the number of the transconjugants in different conditions compared with untreated sample the number of transconjugants was significantly reduced by 67 2 after 10 min surface plasma treatment p 0 05 the addition of inorganic ions fe2 and cu2 promoted the decrease of the transconjugants p 0 05 except no3 addition the number of transconjugants decreased by 90 1 after 10 min surface plasma treatment in the presence of fe2 p 0 05 moreover the conjugative transfer frequency decreased from initial 1 3 10 6 to 1 3 10 7 after 10 min surface plasma treatment p 0 05 fig 5b and it further decreased in the presence of fe2 and cu2 p 0 05 except no3 the addition of fe2 in the surface plasma process induced 99 8 decline in the conjugative transfer frequency these results demonstrated that the conjugative transfer of args was inhibited by the surface plasma treatment which was further inhibited by the addition of organic ions two main factors affecting bacterial horizontal gene transfer were the abundance of bacteria and conjugative transfer frequency guo et al 2015 lin et al 2016 su et al 2019 low bacterial density disfavored the conjugative transfer qiu et al 2012 these results suggested that the surface plasma treatment could inhibit the hgt of args by reducing the number of donor bacteria and conjugative transfer frequency and these actions were strengthened by the addition of inorganic ions nitrous acid inhibited more than 90 of plasmid conjugative transfer by decreasing the initial cell density huang et al 2019 lin et al 2016 reported that the reduced number of donor cells after ultraviolet and chlorine treatment decreased the conjugative transfer frequency for conjugation occurring in liquid environment collide attach and conjugate were necessary zhong et al 2010 the conjugative transfer may be regulated by the sos response cell membrane permeability intercellular adhesion and energy supply maiques et al 2006 liao et al 2019 wang et al 2019 which will be discussed in the following sections 3 4 possible mechanisms of inhibited conjugative transfer of args 3 4 1 sos response previous studies reported that oxidative stress was one of the key signal molecules of bacterial conjugative transfer maiques et al 2006 liao et al 2019 wang et al 2019 effects of inorganic ions addition on the oxidative stress response in ar e coli during the surface plasma processing were evaluated as shown in fig 6 the level of intracellular ros was significantly reduced after 10 min surface plasma treatment p 0 05 and it further decreased in the presence of inorganic ions fe2 no3 and cu2 p 0 05 fig 6a the minimum ros level was observed in the presence of fe2 and there was a 42 2 decline in the intracellular ros level compared with single plasma treatment the conjugative transfer of plasmid was suppressed due to the reduction of oxidative stress and sos response yu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 found that excessive accumulation of ros damaged the cell membrane weakened the important barriers of cells and made them more permeable to the transfer of genetic materials thereby promoting the frequency of args conjugative transfer yu et al 2021 reported that the binding of args was inhibited due to the elimination of excessive intracellular ros by ceo2 nano particles thereby inhibiting the conjugative transfer to reveal the effect of the intracellular ros on the conjugative transfer thiourea was selected as a typical scavenger of ros lu et al 2020 after adding ros scavenger thiourea the conjugative transfer frequency of args was significantly reduced regardless of the presence of inorganic ions fig 5b these results suggested that the decreased ros level indeed induced reduction of conjugative transfer wang et al 2019 also found that the conjugative transfer frequency was significantly reduced when ros scavengers were added during the mating period compared with the control the expression of genes related to sos response lexa and sula and dna repair umuc and umud was significantly down regulated after 10 min surface plasma treatment fig 6b the addition of fe2 further induced the down regulation of expression of genes related to sos response and dna repair therefore the presence of fe2 in the surface plasma system further inhibited the sos response and dna repair of the donor ar e coli reducing the hgt the activities of sod and cat are shown in fig 6c clearly the sod and cat activities decreased after 10 min surface plasma treatment and the presence of fe2 and cu2 further decreased their activities p 0 05 furthermore the genes sodb sodc kate and katg encoding sod and cat activities were down regulated after plasma treatment especially in the presence of fe2 fig 6b it should be noted that the cat and sod as the antioxidative enzymes could scavenge the intracellular ros this action was related with the plasma treatment time guo et al 2017 song et al 2021 under a low exposure time the intracellular ros could trigger bacterial oxidative stress responses and the activities of cat and sod increased to alleviate ros damage under a relatively longer plasma exposure time the sod and cat would be inactivated by the plasma oxidation and bacteria would also be inactivated leading to the decrease in the sod and cat guo et al 2017 the pearson correlation analysis showed that there were significant correlations among conjugative transfer frequency ros level and sod and cat activities table s3 from these phenotypic and genotypic results the surface plasma treatment reduced the conjugative transfer of args due to the decrease in the sos response in the ar e coli strains lu et al 2020 3 4 2 cell membrane permeability the cell membrane integrity was examined via laser scanning confocal microscopy lscm and mda analysis as depicted in figure s7 and fig 7 a before the surface plasma treatment the donor ar e coli cells maintained complete green fluorescence figure s7a a dense population of red fluorescent cells was observed after exposure to plasma for 10 min and more cells with red fluorescent were observed in the presence of inorganic ions especially for fe2 addition figure s7d mda is a typical product of cell membrane lipid oxidation and there is a positive correlation between the content of mda and cell membrane destruction ji et al 2018 compared with the control the concentration of mda increased significantly after 10 min surface plasma treatment and the highest mda concentration was observed after adding fe2 fig 7a p 0 05 indicating that strongest oxidative damages occurred to the donor ar e coli in this case the expression levels of genes related with cell member were evaluated as shown in fig 7b the genes slyb yoaf and yoak coding for outer membrane proteins β barrel protein regulator genes ompc and ompf and osmotic genes osmb and osmc were up regulated after 10 min surface plasma treatment and their expression levels were further up regulated after adding fe2 these results further proved that the cell membrane permeability of the donors was promoted after plasma treatment although the presence of inorganic ions in the plasma process promoted the permeability of cell membranes the transfer of genes between bacteria was inhibited the pearson correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between conjugative transfer frequency and mda table s3 the plasma could directly penetrate and break the cell walls destroyed the cell membrane integrity and cellular culturability leading to the decrease in the number of donor bacteria the concentration of plasmids and args abundances these changes contributed to inhibit the conjugative transfer of args mychack et al 2019 3 4 3 intercellular adhesion the prerequisite for conjugative transfer is intercellular contact between bacteria more et al 2014 extracellular polymeric substance eps was an important part of microbial ecology flemming and wingender 2010 fig 8 a depicts the changes of the ratio of proteins to polysaccharide pn ps and adhesion between bacteria cells the pn ps and adhesion significantly decreased after 10 min plasma treatment and they further decreased in the presence of fe2 and cu2 p 0 05 there were 53 4 and 56 5 declines in the pn ps and adhesion in the presence of fe2 p 0 05 respectively furthermore putative protein export and polysaccharide export related genes in the donor bacteria including tatb sece secg lptc and lptf were down regulated after plasma treatment which were further down regulated after adding fe2 fig 8b these findings demonstrated that plasma treatment mediated the interaction between cells by changing the content of extracellular polysaccharides and proteins especially after adding some inorganic ions previous study reported that ros acted as a secondary signal messenger of metabolism and low ros resulted in a decrease in the amount of eps han et al 2019 eps composition played an important role in cell surface characteristics mainly by changing the hydrophobicity thereby affecting cell adhesion tsuneda et al 2003 the zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter of the donor ar e coli cells both decreased after the surface plasma treatment and the addition of no3 cu2 and fe2 further promoted these processes figure s8 p 0 05 the pearson correlation analysis showed that there were significant correlations among conjugative transfer frequency adhesion and eps table s3 therefore the reduction in the adhesion and eps induced by the surface plasma treatment contributed to inhibit conjugative transfer of args 3 4 4 energy driving force dna transfer and morphogenesis induction of conjugation machines consume energy lu et al 2018 fig 8c depicts the effects of various inorganic ions on atp content of the donor ar e coli during the plasma treatment process compared with the control the atp content decreased by 61 7 after 10 min plasma treatment the addition of no3 fe2 and cu2 further reduced atp content by 76 6 88 5 and 85 4 respectively p 0 05 in the plasma process nitrite could be produced due to nitrogen ionization its content gradually increased with the plasma treatment figure s9 previous studies reported that the no2 could combine with proteins to form complexes which then prevented the degradation of acetone into atp no2 also affected the stability of the energy charge and electron transport chain thereby influencing bacterial atp production and gene expression cunningham bussel et al 2013 komirishetty et al 2017 aryannejad et al 2021 furthermore the transcription levels of atp encoding genes atpb and atpi regulating cellular energy production were down regulated after the plasma treatment and further down regulated in the presence of fe2 fig 8b atp was one of the limiting factors for conjugation of args aghdam et al 2018 lu et al 2018 reported that atp content significantly decreased in bacteria by free nitrous acid which then affected conjugative transfer the pearson correlation analysis in table s3 showed that there was a significantly positive correlation between conjugative transfer frequency and atp these results manifested that inhibited metabolism and available energy occurred in the donor ar e coli after plasma treatment thereby inhibiting the conjugative transfer of args 4 conclusions the potential effects of inorganic ions on inactivation of donor arb args elimination and conjugative transfer of args in a surface plasma system were explored the presence of no3 cu2 and fe2 greatly enhanced the elimination of arb and args via promoting the generation of oh except so4 2 more importantly conjugative transfer of args was significantly inhibited by the surface plasma especially in the presence of fe2 accompanied by dramatic decrease in the number of transconjugants analysis on intracellular ros sos response intercellular contact and energy driving force demonstrated that the expression of sos response genes dna repair genes eps related genes and atp synthesis genes was depressed by the plasma oxidation these changes finally resulted in inhibition of conjugative transfer of args this study provided an option for args control via inhibiting its conjugative transfer further study should be

16672,sewage outbursts affect coastal environments as seawater is enriched with nutrients organic matter and microbes thus can potentially impair seawater reverse osmosis swro desalination in this study we evaluated how municipal sewage outbursts affect swro desalination in a pilot scale system to this end feedwater characteristics i e coastal water the removal efficiency of organic foulants by a dual media gravity filter and cartridge micro filtration were determined daily for 12 days permeate water flux was maintained constant during the study while trans membrane pressure tmp was automatically adjusted and continuously monitored the results indicate that sewage outbursts caused an immediate 1 d buildup of phyto bacterioplankton biomass up to 10 fold and enhanced activity maximal 30 fold followed by an increase in transparent exopolymer particle tep concentrations after sewage addition algal biomass was significantly removed by the pretreatment system 72 90 while a considerable fraction of the bacterial biomass 42 65 and tep 53 65 passed these procedures the result was a negative impact on the desalination performance reflected by a significant increase 10 in ro tmp 7 5 d after the sewage addition our results indicate on a direct link between sewage outbursts pretreatment efficiency and swro desalination nevertheless these findings can lead to new avenues for the development of science based operational protocols to minimize the deleterious effects of abrupt sewage outbursts on swro desalination graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage swro desalination pretreatment efficiency tep microbes 1 introduction coastal ecosystems are routinely exposed to pollution from land based sources such as domestic and industrial wastewater runoffs kirby and beaugrand 2009 halliday and gast 2011 jiang et al 2014 current projections suggest that wastewater runoffs into coastal environments will increase in coming years due to population growth and aging infrastructure thereby enhancing anthropogenic pressures and impacts rombouts et al 2013 chronic discharge of wastewater into coastal environments often occurs after sewage treatment which minimizes the deleterious signatures of the pollutant effluents kress and galil 2016 long et al 2019 in contrast sewage outburst events from municipal sources are sporadic and involve untreated wastewater which may contain pathogens as well as high levels of organic and inorganic nutrients halpern et al 2008 powley et al 2016 these sporadic outbursts have been shown to significantly affect microbial food web dynamics and spur abrupt algal blooms especially in oligotrophic nutrient poor environments rombouts et al 2013 rahav and bar zeev 2017 a rapid increase in algal and bacterial biomass in coastal water was shown to impair seawater desalination processes by severely clogging the pretreatment stages villacorte et al 2015 jamieson and leterme 2021 seawater reverse osmosis swro desalination is a burgeoning industry worldwide mainly due to overuse of natural freshwater sources and the growing global population gude 2017 lim et al 2021 currently the global application of swro constitutes over 50 of the desalination industry worldwide and is estimated at 65 5 million m3 d 1 jones et al 2019 despite the progress in the field of desalination ro membranes still require extensive pretreatment steps to minimize fouling development and maintain constant freshwater production anis et al 2019 a constant flux of desalinated water can be achieved after fouling development on the ro membrane by increasing the trans membrane pressure tmp however an increase in tmp leads to a significant rise in the overall energy costs of desalinated water guo et al 2012 jafari et al 2021 currently little is known about the effects of sewage outbursts on the pretreatment efficiency and desalination performance by swro in this study oligotrophic coastal seawater was amended with sewage in a novel model desalination system pretreated by gravity and cartridge filtration then desalinated using an inline ro system the feedwater properties and removal rates of organic matter by gravity filtration were tested daily while the reverse osmosis performance was continuously measured our findings illuminate the deleterious effects of sewage outbursts on feedwater properties and freshwater production via swro desalination 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design coastal seawater collected from the eastern mediterranean sea ems was desalinated continuously for 12 d using a swro model system with or without the addition of municipal sewage during summer and winter two experiments in each season total of four runs the swro system included downscaled versions of the main stages traditionally operated in large scale facilities fig 1 these stages included a chamber for coagulation of ferric chloride a rapid sand filter rsf a clear well a microfiltration module and a flat ro membrane with a feedwater spacer fig 1 seawater was drawn from the ems into large containers total 2 m3 sewage outburst was mimicked by supplementing the seawater with primary effluent municipal wastewater 1 v v collected from the haifa wastewater treatment plant haifa wwtp co il wastewater treatment such an addition is considered a severe eutrophication scenario in seawater youlian and subba rao 1997 this eutrophication event represent a realistic far field scenario estimated by rahav and bar zeev 2017 rather than the immediate proximity of the discharge point moreover we calculated that the nutrients added through the sewage would specifically represent a high eutrophication scenario in the oligotrophic ems coastal area and impose a non good environmental status non ges as recently described by kress et al 2019 thus the total nitrogen and total suspended particles in the primary effluent were 90 mg l 1 and 600 mg l 1 respectively seawater inflow with or without sewage addition was pumped triwin p 135 model 5228 into a mixed coagulation chamber 660 l and dosed daily with ferric chloride final concentration 1 mg l 1 the hydraulic retention time within the

well tanks were acid washed before their filling with seawater the rsf was filled with matured dual media bar zeev et al 2012a and then backwashed with seawater and air for 1 h the swro system was thoroughly cleaned prior to each experiment specifically distilled water was recirculated through the system followed by ethylenediaminetetraacetic edta final concentration 5 mm addition as well as bleach 10 ethanol 99 and distilled water each cycle lasted 30 min all the experiments were begun by drawing and recirculating fresh seawater that had undergone the entire pretreatment sequence within

otu found in the feedwater samples or onto the ro membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 eutrophication of coastal seawater by sewage outburst nitrate nitrite no3 no2 nox values of the ambient ems water used as the feedwater for all the experiments ranged from 0 12 to 0 77 µmol l 1 orthophosphate po4 3 was usually low and often close to the detection limit 0 05 µmol l 1 chl a proxy for algal biomass and primary productivity pp ranged from 0 01 0 56 µg l 1 and 0 65 23 µg c l 1 d 1 respectively bacterial abundance and corresponding production rates ranged from 7 107 to 45 107 cells l 1 and 1 to 3 7 µg c l 1 d 1 respectively these values agree with previous reports from the coastal yet oligotrophic ems water raveh et al 2015 kress et al 2019 the overall oligotrophic characteristics at the coastal ems result in an environment that is extremely sensitive to eutrophication kress et al 2019 raveh et al 2015 especially to an abrupt inflow of high organic matter and nutrient loads as those found in untreated sewage rahav and bar zeev 2017 unfortunately sewage outbursts are common along the mediterranean coast halpern et al 2008 especially during wintertime when the sewer system is flooded by stormwater a sharp rise in nox 7 fold and po4 3 69 fold relative to the ambient unamended seawater was detected immediately after sewage addition concurrently ba was higher by 90 post sewage addition compared to the ambient values suggesting that the effluent introduced high concentrations of microbes into the seawater as their growth rates are slow exceed 24 24 h relative to eutrophic environments previous studies reported that some sewage bacteria including pathogens can remain viable following discharge into seawater rozen and belkin 2005 no significant difference was measured in algal biomass immediately upon addition p 0 05 yet over the next 4 days after sewage addition an increase in algal biomass was measured 3 fold which gradually decreased in the following 7 days to similar values as the initial conditions fig 2a differently in the ambient unamended seawater algal biomass peaked only on day 7 twofold fig 2a over the course of the entire experiment 0 12 days the median chl a concentrations following sewage addition were higher by 83 compared to the ambient coastal water fig 2b primary productivity pp exhibited a similar temporal trend as observed for the chl a fig 2c d yet the increase in the magnitude of the sewage amended vs controls was higher up to 7 fold following the addition of sewage ba and bp peaked on two occasions days 2 and 9 fig 2e g while a weak decrease in ba was found over time in the ambient seawater over the entire experiment the median ba and bp values were significantly higher by 134 and 85 respectively following sewage addition compared to the ambient seawater levels fig 2f h tep concentrations sharply peaked 8 days after sewage addition 5 fold higher than the initial value while in the ambient seawater they remained mostly unchanged fig 2i nonetheless the median tep concentrations throughout the course of the entire operation were similar between the ambient water and the sewage addition treatments fig 2j sudden inflow of organic matter and nutrients especially n and p to nutrient poor coastal environments as in our study often leads to an immediate food web cascade 1 2 days after the outburst bacterioplankton heterotrophs and phototrophs often have a high surface area to volume ratio enabling them to rapidly utilize nutrients from the environment compared to large size microphytoplankton irwin et al 2006 therefore sewage outburst into oligotrophic coastal water as tested here can cause a swift increase in bacterioplankton biomass followed by a sharp rise in microphytoplankton concentrations rombouts et al 2013 rahav and bar zeev 2017 other studies have shown that coastal eutrophication from sewage may also cause the formation of large harmful algal blooms anderson et al 2008 lapointe et al 2015 these bacterial and algal blooms collapse after a few days as nutrients and organic matter are consumed while high concentrations of extracellular substances such as tep are released kiørboe and hansen 1993 bar zeev et al 2009b li et al 2015 tep are small 0 4 300 µm sticky particles constituted primarily by acidic polysaccharides passow 2002 and are often released to the environment during the demise of algal blooms it should be noted that the specific origin of tep measured in these coastal feedwater i e bacterial microphytoplankton and or zooplankton couldn t not be directly determined tep were shown to pass through desalination pretreatment stages and act as active agents in membrane fouling thus negatively affect desalination efficiency bar zeev et al 2009a 2015a villacorte et al 2009 berman et al 2011 thus eutrophication of coastal seawater may directly and indirectly impair swro desalination operation in numerous large scale facilities worldwide 3 2 pretreatment efficiency of sand filtration following a sewage outburst removal of foulants from feedwater by rsf was determined separately for days 0 4 and days 5 12 table 1 corresponding to the tmp increase of the ro membrane after sewage addition fig 3 the removal of algal biomass from the feedwater by the sand filter was high throughout the entire experiment 90 even though algal biomass in the feedwater was 2 3 fold higher after sewage addition fig 2b the average removal during the first 4 days was similar to the ambient values table 1 however during the later stages of the experiment days 5 12 the average removal of chl a by the sand filter reduced to 70 table 1 the average bacterial removal by sand filtration was low during days 0 4 in both the control and sewage experiments 40 yet it improved over the next seven days to 52 65 days 5 12 table 1 average tep removal post sewage addition on days 0 4 was 50 which was higher than under ambient conditions 37 however the average removal of tep from the ambient water significantly improved during days 5 12 96 while it remained unchanged overall relative to the initial values in the seawater after sewage addition 65 table 1 coagulants and gravity dual media filtration are typically used in large scale swro facilities to remove organic foulants from the feedwater thus minimizing membrane fouling bar zeev et al 2012a badruzzaman et al 2019 dayarathne et al 2021 our results show removal efficiencies of organic foulants from ambient seawater after sand filtration that are similar to those reported for large scale swro desalination facilities bar zeev et al 2015a abushaban et al 2021 differently than unamended ambient seawater we found that 5 12 days after a sewage outburst the most significant reduction in the removal efficiency of organic foulant was related to tep removal of particulate matter by coagulation and sand filtration is mostly based on media adsorption and size exclusion ranging from 0 2 µm to 50 µm voutchkov 2010 we surmise that the drastic changes in the filtration efficiency of tep were related to the initial feedwater concentrations table 1 and possibly also due to changes in the sizes of these polysaccharide particles gelatinous particles such as tep may undergo spontaneous assemble dismantle stages and thus may be found in a dynamic size spectrum in addition these particles can be directly shed from microbial organisms with a wide range of sizes µm to mm leading to differences in the sizes of tep found in the environment villacorte et al 2009 bar zeev et al 2015a these dynamic feedwater changes in tep concentrations and the related removal efficiencies may critically impair ro membrane performance berman et al 2011 bar zeev et al 2015a 3 3 sewage outbursts impair swro performance permeate water flux was constantly maintained at 17 5 0 5 l m2 h 1 during the entire experiment regardless of the intake water quality fig 3a tmp measurements of ro in the control treatments were constant at 55 3 1 1 bar over the entire course of the experiments fig 3b in contrast ro tmp significantly increased 3 9 4 5 d after sewage addition and continued to rise to 10 after 7 5 d until a steady state was reached on day 9 27 6 fig 3b p 0 05 an autopsy of the ro membranes from the control treatments at the conclusion of the experiment fig 4a indicated that a cake layer developed on the membrane with the two following appearance types i a rough organic like surface and bacteria melián martel et al 2012 fortunato et al 2020 fig 4b and ii a smooth and compact film fig 4c differently ro membranes from the sewage treatments fig 4d were completely coved by a rough matrix and bacteria fig 4e as previously observed for ro membranes that were exposed to organic foulants jafari et al 2020 in addition large clusters a few tens of microns each of extracellular polymeric substance eps like structures and organic material were often captured on the membrane surface fig 4f no micro algae were detected on any of the ro membranes in accordance with the high chl a removal efficiency by the sand filter table 1 large scale desalination facilities are obligated to produce a continuous volume of freshwater thus permeate water flux must remain constant however scaling and organic fouling often impair ro membrane performance leading to significant reductions in permeate water flux weinrich et al 2016 many fundamental experiments performed in lab scale systems have indicated that high loads of bacteria and organic materials e g alginate and or bsa which were directly added to the ro feedwater resulted in severe membrane fouling e g nguyen et al 2014 this fouling layer increases the hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 kim and dempsey 2013 while simultaneously leading to the formation of cake enhanced concentration polarization hoek and elimelech 2003 thus reducing permeate water flux this reduction in the permeate water flux can be overcome by increasing the tmp consequently leading to increases in the energy demand and operational costs of the desalination process in addition increasing tmp may compress the fouling matrix xie et al 2015 and hinder membrane cleaning dreszer et al 2013 she et al 2016 therefore large scale desalination facilities typically halt operation once tmp exceeds a 10 15 increase above the routine pressure the results of this study indicate that desalination operators may stop freshwater production 6 7 days after sewage inflow into oligotrophic coastal seawater as tmp increase 10 above the routine operational pressure fig 3 since no micro algal cells were found on the membrane surface fig 4 we postulate that the sharp increase in tmp beginning at the fourth day after the sewage outburst was mostly due to the deposition of bacteria and organic material that passed through the pretreatment procedure 3 4 impact of sewage outburst on the bacterial communities in the feedwater and ro membrane biofilms operational taxonomic units otus based on miseq sequencing of 16s rrna were 1051 for communities in the coastal environment 16 929 after sewage addition the otus of biofilm forming bacteria on the ro membranes after ambient seawater desalination were 4290 and 6551 after sewage addition n 5 the shannon index indicated that the bacterial communities in the feedwater were 1 3 times richer on day 1 after sewage addition than the ambient seawater these results indicate that new bacterial species were introduced into the coastal feedwater with the sewage however it was found that the richness of bacterial biofilms that developed on the ro membrane were similar after desalinating ambient feedwater or seawater with sewage amendment following the above pcoa tests indicated that bacterial communities clustered together after sewage addition including those forming biofilms on the ro membranes fig 5 however statistical significance by anosim and permanova tests could not be concluded the initial bacterial community in the coastal ambient feedwater included three main classes yet dominated 35 75 by alphaproteobacteria which constitute mostly by the rhodobacteraceae family fig 6 this family include a wide range of planktonic and biofilm forming species elifantz et al 2013 moreover rhodobacteraceae was reported to have a central role in biofilm initiation as they rapidly colonize membranes by secreting extracellular factors kviatkovski and minz 2015 at the conclusion of the experiment day 12 both alphaproteobacteria 35 and gammaproteobacteria 42 dominated the bacterial community in the feedwater with alteromonas being the predominant genus of the later the biofilm community that developed on the ro membrane following 12 days of coastal water desalination comprised 6 classes and was dominated by alphaproteobacteria 50 rhodobacteraceae and sphingomonas were found to be the eminent family and genus respectively fig 6 sphingomonas was previously found to have a central role in biofilm formation and module biofouling of large scale swro desalination facilities garcia jimenez et al 2019 kim et al 2020 interestingly 1 4 of the total biofilm otus were classified as legionellales a protobacteria order that comprised two pathogenic families legionella and coxiella these families are often found in sewage and occasionally also in urban coastal water bennett and bentham 2006 we suggest that although the relative abundance of legionellales was low in the feedwater 1 this order was detected on the ro membrane at higher relative abundances due to their concentration onto the membrane surface immediately after sewage addition the bacterial community in the feedwater comprised 6 classes all 3 of the total otus the dominated class was gammaproteobacteria 58 with candidatus endobugula neptuniibacter and pseudomonas being the most eminent genuses specifically pseudomonas constituted 10 of all the identified genuses after sewage addition the pseudomonas genus and especially the p aeruginosa specie is often used as an indicator for sewage contamination of coastal water januário et al 2020 biofilm community structure was dominated by alphaproteobacteria 46 and gammaproteobacteria 36 with legionellales accounting for 6 5 of all the retrieved genuses fig 6 the higher representation 4 fold of legionellales compared to ambient conditions provide indication on the formation of biofilm that originated from the simulated sewage outburst contrary we propose that the pseudomonas genus was not found after 12 days in the feedwater or on the membrane s surface as sewage species such as p aeruginosa can be severely impaired in saline environments 3 5 relationship between microbial parameters in the feedwater and tmp various water quality parameters such as elevated nutrients ions organic matter algae and bacteria were previously shown to impact the tmp of swro membranes e g chong et al 2008 kim and dempsey 2013 in this study a positive linear correlation was detected between algal biomass in the clear well and tmp after sewage addition fig 7a in contrast no correlation was detected between bacterial abundance and tmp fig 7b this was surprising as the sizes of most marine bacteria are small 0 2 µm to a few micrometers kirchman 2016 thus theoretically were more likely to pass through the pretreatment system than algal cells nonetheless a significant linear correlation was determined between tep and tmp after sewage addition fig 7c suggesting that these particles were linked to algal cells discharge of untreated sewage into the oligotrophic eastern mediterranean coast was shown to result in a swift growth of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton roelke et al 1997 youlian and subba rao 1997 yuan et al 2010 rahav and bar zeev 2017 with similar concentrations and magnitudes as measured in the feedwater in this study the sharp rise in algal and bacterial biomass was followed by a quick 2 days reduction in cell numbers such a swift demise of phytoplankton blooms was reported to be closely linked to enhanced tep formation in the surrounding environment bar zeev et al 2009b villacorte et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 we surmise that the tmp increase was indirectly linked to changes in algal biomass as chl a removal by sand filtration was 70 table 1 and no algal cells were found on the membrane surface fig 4 in contrast it is likely that the tmp increase was caused by gelatinous matter such as tep that passed through the pretreatment stages bar zeev et al 2015a formed an organic condition layer on the membrane surface berman et al 2011 bar zeev et al 2012b villacorte et al 2013 and expedited biofilm formation bar zeev et al 2015a lee et al 2015 alpatova et al 2020 this organic fouling can severely impair permeate water flux as osmotic pressure is often higher on the membrane surface due to cake enhanced concentration polarization hoek and elimelech 2003 kim et al 2009 she et al 2016 it should be noted that removal of tep reinforces biofouling was limited using conventional membrane cleaning approaches therefore most efforts in this field were focused in minimizing the effects of tep on membrane fouling by reducing its concentrations in the ro feedwater bar zeev et al 2015a meng et al 2020 currently efforts are undertaken to remove tep from biofouled

coastal environment and specifically to desalination pretreatment efficiency and swro performance the results indicate that raw sewage outbursts contrary to chronic discharge of secondary effluent wastewater can trigger an abrupt 1 day and strong 3 7 fold increase in microorganic biomass leading to a swift rise in tmp 10 on day 7 and thus pose a severe concern to swro desalination the increase in tmp was correlated with phytoplankton biomass and tep rather than small sized heterotrophic bacteria these results highlight that bacterioplankton derived tep constitute a serious operational factor for desalination facilities as previously pointed moreover it is shown here for the first time that human induced eutrophication can critically worsen these negative effects given that coastal eutrophication is likely to increase in the future ipcc report 2020 desalination facilities will need to adapt their pretreatment protocols to reduce the deleterious effects of tep on ro performance

16672,sewage outbursts affect coastal environments as seawater is enriched with nutrients organic matter and microbes thus can potentially impair seawater reverse osmosis swro desalination in this study we evaluated how municipal sewage outbursts affect swro desalination in a pilot scale system to this end feedwater characteristics i e coastal water the removal efficiency of organic foulants by a dual media gravity filter and cartridge micro filtration were determined daily for 12 days permeate water flux was maintained constant during the study while trans membrane pressure tmp was automatically adjusted and continuously monitored the results indicate that sewage outbursts caused an immediate 1 d buildup of phyto bacterioplankton biomass up to 10 fold and enhanced activity maximal 30 fold followed by an increase in transparent exopolymer particle tep concentrations after sewage addition algal biomass was significantly removed by the pretreatment system 72 90 while a considerable fraction of the bacterial biomass 42 65 and tep 53 65 passed these procedures the result was a negative impact on the desalination performance reflected by a significant increase 10 in ro

swro desalination pretreatment efficiency tep microbes 1 introduction coastal ecosystems are routinely exposed to pollution from land based sources such as domestic and industrial wastewater runoffs kirby and beaugrand 2009 halliday and gast 2011 jiang et al 2014 current projections suggest that wastewater runoffs into coastal environments will increase in coming years due to population growth and aging infrastructure thereby enhancing anthropogenic pressures and impacts rombouts et al 2013 chronic discharge of wastewater into coastal environments often occurs after sewage treatment which minimizes the deleterious signatures of the pollutant effluents kress and galil 2016 long et al 2019 in contrast sewage outburst events from municipal sources are sporadic and involve untreated wastewater which may contain pathogens as well as high levels of organic and inorganic nutrients halpern et al 2008 powley et al 2016 these sporadic outbursts have been shown to significantly affect microbial food web dynamics and spur abrupt algal blooms especially in oligotrophic nutrient poor environments rombouts et al 2013 rahav and bar zeev 2017 a rapid increase in algal and bacterial biomass in coastal water was shown to impair seawater desalination processes by severely clogging the pretreatment stages villacorte et al 2015 jamieson and leterme 2021 seawater reverse osmosis swro desalination is a burgeoning industry worldwide mainly due to overuse of natural freshwater sources and the growing global population gude 2017 lim et al 2021 currently the global application of swro constitutes over 50 of the desalination industry worldwide and is estimated at 65 5 million m3 d 1 jones et al 2019 despite the progress in the field of desalination ro membranes still require extensive pretreatment steps to minimize fouling development and maintain constant freshwater production anis et al 2019 a constant flux of desalinated water can be achieved after fouling development on the ro membrane by increasing the trans membrane pressure tmp however an increase in tmp leads to a significant rise in the overall energy costs of desalinated water guo et al 2012 jafari et al 2021 currently little is known about the effects of sewage outbursts on the pretreatment efficiency and desalination performance by swro in this study oligotrophic coastal seawater was amended with sewage in a novel model desalination system pretreated by gravity and cartridge filtration then desalinated using an inline ro system the feedwater properties and removal rates of organic matter by gravity filtration were tested daily while the reverse osmosis performance was continuously measured our findings illuminate the deleterious effects of sewage outbursts on feedwater properties and freshwater production via swro desalination 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design coastal seawater collected from the eastern mediterranean sea ems was desalinated continuously for 12 d using a swro model system with or without the addition of municipal sewage during summer and winter two experiments in each season total of four runs the swro system included downscaled versions of the main stages traditionally operated in large scale facilities fig 1 these stages included a chamber for coagulation of ferric chloride a rapid sand filter rsf a clear well a microfiltration module and a flat ro membrane with a feedwater spacer fig 1 seawater was drawn from the ems into large containers total 2 m3 sewage outburst was mimicked by supplementing the seawater with primary effluent municipal wastewater 1 v v collected from the haifa wastewater treatment plant haifa wwtp co il wastewater treatment such an addition is considered a severe eutrophication scenario in seawater youlian and subba rao 1997 this eutrophication event represent a realistic far field scenario estimated by rahav and bar zeev 2017 rather than the immediate proximity of the discharge point moreover we calculated that the nutrients added through the sewage would specifically represent a high eutrophication scenario in the oligotrophic ems coastal area and impose a non good environmental status non

sewage addition was pumped triwin p 135 model 5228 into a mixed coagulation chamber 660 l and dosed daily with ferric chloride final concentration 1 mg l 1 the hydraulic retention time within the

otu found in the feedwater samples or onto the ro membrane 3 results and discussion 3 1 eutrophication of coastal seawater by sewage outburst nitrate nitrite no3 no2 nox values of the ambient ems water used as the feedwater for all the experiments ranged from 0 12 to 0 77 µmol l 1 orthophosphate po4 3 was usually low and often close to the detection limit 0 05 µmol l 1 chl a proxy for algal biomass and primary productivity pp ranged from 0 01 0 56 µg l 1 and 0 65 23 µg c l 1 d 1 respectively bacterial abundance and corresponding production rates ranged from 7 107 to 45 107 cells l 1 and 1 to 3 7 µg c l 1 d 1 respectively these values agree with previous reports from the coastal yet oligotrophic ems water raveh et al 2015 kress et al 2019 the overall oligotrophic characteristics at the coastal ems result in an environment that is extremely sensitive to eutrophication kress et al 2019 raveh et al 2015 especially to an abrupt inflow of high organic matter and nutrient loads as those found in untreated sewage rahav and bar zeev 2017 unfortunately sewage outbursts are common along the mediterranean coast halpern et al 2008 especially during wintertime when the sewer system is flooded by stormwater a sharp rise in nox 7 fold and po4 3 69 fold relative to the ambient unamended seawater was detected immediately after sewage addition concurrently ba was higher by 90 post sewage addition compared to the ambient values suggesting that the effluent introduced high concentrations of microbes into the seawater as their growth rates are slow exceed 24 24 h relative to eutrophic environments previous studies reported that some sewage bacteria including pathogens can remain viable following discharge into seawater rozen and belkin 2005 no significant difference was measured in algal biomass immediately upon addition p 0 05 yet over the next 4 days after sewage addition an increase in algal biomass was measured 3 fold which gradually decreased in the following 7 days to similar values as the initial conditions fig 2a differently in the ambient unamended seawater algal biomass peaked only on day 7 twofold fig 2a over the course of the entire experiment 0 12 days the median chl a concentrations following sewage addition were higher by 83 compared to the ambient coastal water fig 2b primary productivity pp exhibited a similar temporal trend as observed for the chl a fig 2c d yet the increase in the magnitude of the sewage amended vs controls was higher up to 7 fold following the addition of sewage ba and bp peaked on two occasions days 2 and 9 fig 2e g while a weak decrease in ba was found over time in the ambient seawater over the entire experiment the median ba and bp values were significantly higher by 134 and 85 respectively following sewage addition compared to the ambient seawater levels fig 2f h tep concentrations sharply peaked 8 days after sewage addition 5 fold higher than the initial value while in the ambient seawater they remained mostly unchanged fig 2i nonetheless the median tep concentrations throughout the course of the entire operation were similar between the ambient water and the sewage addition treatments fig 2j sudden inflow of organic matter and nutrients especially n and p to nutrient poor coastal environments as in our study often leads to an immediate food web cascade 1 2 days after the outburst bacterioplankton heterotrophs and phototrophs often have a high surface area to volume ratio enabling them to rapidly utilize nutrients from the environment compared to large size microphytoplankton irwin et al 2006 therefore sewage outburst into oligotrophic coastal water as tested here can cause a swift increase in bacterioplankton biomass followed by a sharp rise in microphytoplankton concentrations rombouts et al 2013 rahav and bar zeev 2017 other studies have shown that coastal eutrophication from sewage may also cause the formation of large harmful algal blooms anderson et al 2008 lapointe et al 2015 these bacterial and algal blooms collapse after a few days as nutrients and organic matter are consumed while high concentrations of extracellular substances such as tep are released kiørboe and hansen 1993 bar zeev et al 2009b li et al 2015 tep are small 0 4 300 µm sticky particles constituted primarily by acidic polysaccharides passow 2002 and are often released to the environment during the demise of algal blooms it should be noted that the specific origin of tep measured in these coastal feedwater i e bacterial microphytoplankton and or zooplankton couldn t not be directly determined tep were shown to pass through desalination pretreatment stages and act as active agents in membrane fouling thus negatively affect desalination efficiency bar zeev et al 2009a 2015a villacorte et al 2009 berman et al 2011 thus eutrophication of coastal seawater may directly and indirectly impair swro desalination operation in numerous large scale facilities worldwide 3 2 pretreatment efficiency of sand filtration following a sewage outburst removal of foulants from feedwater by rsf was determined separately for days 0 4 and days 5 12 table 1 corresponding to the tmp increase of the ro membrane after sewage addition fig 3 the removal of algal biomass from the feedwater by the sand filter was high throughout the entire experiment 90 even though algal biomass in the feedwater was 2 3 fold higher after sewage addition fig 2b the average removal during the first 4 days was similar to the ambient values table 1 however during the later stages of the experiment days 5 12 the average removal of chl a by the sand filter reduced to 70 table 1 the average bacterial removal by sand filtration was low during days 0 4 in both the control and sewage experiments 40 yet it improved over the next seven days to 52 65 days 5 12 table 1 average tep removal post sewage addition on days 0 4 was 50 which was higher than under ambient conditions 37 however the average removal of tep from the ambient water significantly improved during days 5 12 96 while it remained unchanged overall relative to the initial values in the seawater after sewage addition 65 table 1 coagulants and gravity dual media filtration are typically used in large scale swro facilities to remove organic foulants from the feedwater thus minimizing membrane fouling bar zeev et al 2012a badruzzaman et al 2019 dayarathne et al 2021 our results show removal efficiencies of organic foulants from ambient seawater after sand filtration that are similar to those reported for large scale swro desalination facilities bar zeev et al 2015a abushaban et al 2021 differently than unamended ambient seawater we found that 5 12 days after a sewage outburst the most significant reduction in the removal efficiency of organic foulant was related to tep removal of particulate matter by coagulation and sand filtration is mostly based on media adsorption and size exclusion ranging from 0 2 µm to 50 µm voutchkov 2010 we surmise that the drastic changes in the filtration efficiency of tep were related to the initial feedwater concentrations table 1 and possibly also due to changes in the sizes of these polysaccharide particles gelatinous particles such as tep may undergo spontaneous assemble dismantle stages and thus may be found in a dynamic size spectrum in addition these particles can be directly shed from microbial organisms with a wide range of sizes µm to mm leading to differences in the sizes of tep found in the environment villacorte et al 2009 bar zeev et al 2015a these dynamic feedwater changes in tep concentrations and the related removal efficiencies may critically impair ro membrane performance berman et al 2011 bar zeev et al 2015a 3 3 sewage outbursts impair swro performance permeate water flux was constantly maintained at 17 5 0 5 l m2 h 1 during the entire experiment regardless of the intake water quality fig 3a tmp measurements of ro in the control treatments were constant at 55 3 1 1 bar over the entire course of the experiments fig 3b in contrast ro tmp significantly increased 3 9 4 5 d after sewage addition and continued to rise to 10 after 7 5 d until a steady state was reached on day 9 27 6 fig 3b p 0 05 an autopsy of the ro membranes from the control treatments at the conclusion of the experiment fig 4a indicated that a cake layer developed on the membrane with the two following appearance types i a rough organic like surface and bacteria melián martel et al 2012 fortunato et al 2020 fig 4b and ii a smooth and compact film fig 4c differently ro membranes from the sewage treatments fig 4d were completely coved by a rough matrix and bacteria fig 4e as previously observed for ro membranes that were exposed to organic foulants jafari et al 2020 in addition large clusters a few tens of microns each of extracellular polymeric substance eps like structures and organic material were often captured on the membrane surface fig 4f no micro algae were detected on any of the ro membranes in accordance with the high chl a removal efficiency by the sand filter table 1 large scale desalination facilities are obligated to produce a continuous volume of freshwater thus permeate water flux must remain constant however scaling and organic fouling often impair ro membrane performance leading to significant reductions in permeate water flux weinrich et al 2016 many fundamental experiments performed in lab scale systems have indicated that high loads of bacteria and organic materials e g alginate and or bsa which were directly added to the ro feedwater resulted in severe membrane fouling e g nguyen et al 2014 this fouling layer increases the hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 kim and dempsey 2013 while simultaneously leading to the formation of cake enhanced concentration polarization hoek and elimelech 2003 thus reducing permeate water flux this reduction in the permeate water flux can be overcome by increasing the tmp consequently leading to increases in the energy demand and operational costs of the desalination process in addition increasing tmp may compress the fouling matrix xie et al 2015 and hinder membrane cleaning dreszer et al 2013 she et al 2016 therefore large scale desalination facilities typically halt operation once tmp exceeds a 10 15 increase above the routine pressure the results of this study indicate that desalination operators may stop freshwater production 6 7 days after sewage inflow into oligotrophic coastal seawater as tmp increase 10 above the routine operational pressure fig 3 since no micro algal cells were found on the membrane surface fig 4 we postulate that the sharp increase in tmp beginning at the fourth day after the sewage outburst was mostly due to the deposition of bacteria and organic material that passed through the pretreatment procedure 3 4 impact of sewage outburst on the bacterial communities in the feedwater and ro membrane biofilms operational taxonomic units otus based on miseq sequencing of 16s rrna were 1051 for communities in the coastal environment 16 929 after sewage addition the otus of biofilm forming bacteria on the ro membranes after ambient seawater desalination were 4290 and 6551 after sewage addition n 5 the shannon index indicated that the bacterial communities in the feedwater were 1 3 times richer on day 1 after sewage addition than the ambient seawater these results indicate that new bacterial species were introduced into the coastal feedwater with the sewage however it was found that the richness of bacterial biofilms that developed on the ro membrane were similar after desalinating ambient feedwater or seawater with sewage amendment following the above pcoa tests indicated that bacterial communities clustered together after sewage addition including those forming biofilms on the ro membranes fig 5 however statistical significance by anosim and permanova tests could not be concluded the initial bacterial community in the coastal ambient feedwater included three main classes yet dominated 35 75 by alphaproteobacteria which constitute mostly by the rhodobacteraceae family fig 6 this family include a wide range of planktonic and biofilm forming species elifantz et al 2013 moreover rhodobacteraceae was reported to have a central role in biofilm initiation as they rapidly colonize membranes by secreting extracellular factors kviatkovski and minz 2015 at the conclusion of the experiment day 12 both alphaproteobacteria 35 and gammaproteobacteria 42 dominated the bacterial community in the feedwater with alteromonas being the predominant genus of the later the biofilm community that developed on the ro membrane following 12 days of coastal water desalination comprised 6 classes and was dominated by alphaproteobacteria 50 rhodobacteraceae and sphingomonas were found to be the eminent family and genus respectively fig 6 sphingomonas was previously found to have a central role in biofilm formation and module biofouling of large scale swro desalination facilities garcia jimenez et al 2019 kim et al 2020 interestingly 1 4 of the total biofilm otus were classified as legionellales a protobacteria order that comprised two pathogenic families legionella and coxiella these families are often found in sewage and occasionally also in urban coastal water bennett and bentham 2006 we suggest that although the relative abundance of legionellales was low in the feedwater 1 this order was detected on the ro membrane at higher relative abundances due to their concentration onto the membrane surface immediately after sewage addition the bacterial community in the feedwater comprised 6 classes all 3 of the total otus the dominated class was gammaproteobacteria 58 with candidatus endobugula neptuniibacter and pseudomonas being the most eminent genuses specifically pseudomonas constituted 10 of all the identified genuses after sewage addition the pseudomonas genus and especially the p aeruginosa specie is often used as an indicator for sewage contamination of coastal water januário et al 2020 biofilm community structure was dominated by alphaproteobacteria 46 and gammaproteobacteria 36 with legionellales accounting for 6 5 of all the retrieved genuses fig 6 the higher representation 4 fold of legionellales compared to ambient conditions provide indication on the formation of biofilm that originated from the simulated sewage outburst contrary we propose that the pseudomonas genus was not found after 12 days in the feedwater or on the membrane s surface as sewage species such as p aeruginosa can be severely impaired in saline environments 3 5 relationship between microbial parameters in the feedwater and tmp various water quality parameters such as elevated nutrients ions organic matter algae and bacteria were previously shown to impact the tmp of swro membranes e g chong et al 2008 kim and dempsey 2013 in this study a positive linear correlation was detected between algal biomass in the clear well and tmp after sewage addition fig 7a in contrast no correlation was detected between bacterial abundance and tmp fig 7b this was surprising as the sizes of most marine bacteria are small 0 2 µm to a few micrometers kirchman 2016 thus theoretically were more likely to pass through the pretreatment system than algal cells nonetheless a significant linear correlation was determined between tep and tmp after sewage addition fig 7c suggesting that these particles were linked to algal cells discharge of untreated sewage into the oligotrophic eastern mediterranean coast was shown to result in a swift growth of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton roelke et al 1997 youlian and subba rao 1997 yuan et al 2010 rahav and bar zeev 2017 with similar concentrations and magnitudes as measured in the feedwater in this study the sharp rise in algal and bacterial biomass was followed by a quick 2 days reduction in cell numbers such a swift demise of phytoplankton blooms was reported to be closely linked to enhanced tep formation in the surrounding environment bar zeev et al 2009b villacorte et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 we surmise that the tmp increase was indirectly linked to changes in algal biomass as chl a removal by sand filtration was 70 table 1 and no algal cells were found on the membrane surface fig 4 in contrast it is likely that the tmp increase was caused by gelatinous matter such as tep that passed through the pretreatment stages bar zeev et al 2015a formed an organic condition layer on the membrane surface berman et al 2011 bar zeev et al 2012b villacorte et al 2013 and expedited biofilm formation bar zeev et al 2015a lee et al 2015 alpatova et al 2020 this organic fouling can severely impair permeate water flux as osmotic pressure is often higher on the membrane surface due to cake enhanced concentration polarization hoek and elimelech 2003 kim et al 2009 she et al 2016 it should be noted that removal of tep reinforces biofouling was limited using conventional membrane cleaning approaches therefore most efforts in this field were focused in minimizing the effects of tep on membrane fouling by reducing its concentrations in the ro feedwater bar zeev et al 2015a meng et al 2020 currently efforts are undertaken to remove tep from biofouled membranes via new approaches such as dissolved co2 e g alpatova et al 2020 yet no applicable approach is commercially viable 4 conclusion this study directly links the effects of sewage outbursts to coastal environment and specifically to desalination pretreatment efficiency and swro performance the results indicate that raw sewage outbursts contrary to chronic discharge of secondary effluent wastewater can trigger an abrupt 1 day and strong 3 7 fold increase in microorganic biomass leading to a swift rise in tmp 10 on day 7 and thus pose a severe concern to swro desalination the increase in tmp was correlated with phytoplankton biomass and tep rather than small sized heterotrophic bacteria these results highlight that bacterioplankton derived tep constitute a serious operational factor for desalination facilities as previously pointed moreover it is shown here for the first time that human induced eutrophication can critically worsen these negative effects given that coastal eutrophication is likely to increase in the future ipcc report 2020 desalination facilities will need to adapt their pretreatment protocols to reduce the deleterious effects of tep on ro performance specifically we suggest the following actions to minimize the impact of sewage outbursts on swro desalination processes following a sewage outburst i monitor chl a by online fluorescence sensors in the desalination intake port and polysaccharide concentrations in the feedwater as these were found to be the central foulants ii enhance coagulant concentrations and shorten dosage intervals especially once chl a fluorescence starts to decline indicating on algal demise and tep release polysaccharides including tep are negatively charged therefore increasing the coagulant dosage will aggregate these particles especially small gel molecules thus reducing the risk of them passing through a sand filter iii develop new active barriers that are based on polysaccharide adsorption these types of barriers e g komlenic et al 2013 could be deployed before the sand filter during such abrupt sewage events enabling constant production of freshwater together these approaches could minimize

16673,the spatiotemporal variations influencing factors and potential sources as well as the ecological health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs were systematically investigated in seawater sediment and fish from xiangshan bay china one of the most important and oldest domestic marine aquaculture bases the average concentrations of σpahs in seawater sediment and fish were 150 70 0 ng l 276 271 μg kg dry weight dw and 434 151 μg kg dw respectively naphthalene phenanthrene fluoranthene benzo b fluoranthene and pyrene were the dominant contaminants in all samples the highest pah concentrations in the seawater and sediment samples occurred in the inner bay where the mariculture and industry are clustered seasonal differences were observed in the seawater samples but not in the sediment samples among all 15 fish species large yellow croaker larimichthys crocea 775 μg kg dw red drum sciaenops ocellatus 749 μg kg dw and flathead grey mullet mugil cephalus 637 μg kg dw had relatively high pah accumulation concentrations in muscle tissue according to the molecular diagnostic ratio method the pahs in seawater mainly originated from a mixed source of petroleum and combustion whereas biomass coal combustion sources were identified for sediment the results obtained from the risk quotient for seawater sediment quality guidelines and toxic equivalence quotients for seawater and sediment methods showed that the ecological risks posed by pahs were generally at a low to moderate level potentially toxic effects existed from pah contaminated fish consumption and the resulting potential carcinogenic risk was also slightly higher than the recommended guidelines 10 6 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons spatiotemporal characteristics source apportionment ecological risk assessment mariculture environment 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs a class of semi volatile organic contaminants with potential teratogenicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity have attracted a great amount of public attention for many decades jafarabadi et al 2019 pahs are primarily derived from anthropogenic activities including the incomplete combustion of organic matter e g oil fossil fuels and wood and the release of crude oil frapiccini et al 2018 pahs are ubiquitous in the environment including water bodies sediments aquatic products and even humans jafarabadi et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 pahs can transfer into the coastal areas through the atmospheric deposition dry and wet river runoff and sewage discharge frapiccini et al 2020 in addition the spatial distributions of pahs are affected by their air sea or air sediment depositions water flow rates water levels and prevailing physicochemical properties at the site e g the organic content therefore considering their persistence accumulation and toxicity the adverse health and ecological effects of pahs on humans and environmental habitants are of serious concern estuaries and bays are important aquatic ecosystems that are considered to be the ultimate reservoirs for terrigenous pollutants e g heavy metals organic contaminants zhao et al 2018 li et al 2015 recently pahs have been widely detected in aquatic ecosystems and aquatic organisms resulting in the strong bioconcentration along the food web specifically fish are recognized as top consumers with a relatively long lifespan in aquatic ecosystems yu et al 2019 as reported the production and consumption of aquatic products e g economic fish and shellfish are increasing yearly wang et al 2020a the consumption of aquatic products contaminated by pahs could cause lasting damage to human health thus elucidating the status potential sources and risks of pahs in typical aquatic ecosystems is crucial and can provide valuable references xiangshan bay xsb in the east china sea is known as the big fish pond it is a long narrow semi enclosed influential and high yield national aquaculture base lin et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 however the environmental quality of the xsb is seriously and adversely affected by intensive anthropogenic activities including industry shipbuilding and power enterprises agricultural sewage discharges mariculture and fishing boat activities and urbanization zhao et al 2018 numerous studies have reported environmental pollutants in the xsb such as polychlorinated biphenyls lin et al 2020 heavy metals zhao et al 2018 and microplastics wu et al 2020 although pah contaminants have been reported in the xsb by investigations of the pollution characteristics of pahs in sediment and larimichthys crocea wang et al 2019 wang et al 2015 comprehensive studies on the distribution of pahs and corresponding risk assessments in the multiple environmental media present in economic and fishing areas in the xsb are lacking in the current study pahs spatiotemporal variations in seawater and sediment as well as the concentrations in different fish species in the xsb were first investigated in addition the potential sources and ecological health risks of pahs were evaluated the data obtained in this study will provide valuable references for illustrating and preventing the ecological and health risks of pahs in typical bays 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sixteen pahs usepa priority pahs and 5

china c18 500 mg 6 ml si 1 g 6 ml and florisil 1 g 6 ml solid phase extraction spe cartridges were purchased from anpel laboratory technologies shanghai china 2 2 sampling a total of 31 sampling sites were carefully selected to represent the xsb space and thus covered breeding and nonbreeding areas fig 1 seawater and sediment samples were collected in january may august and november 2019 most of the fish samples were collected from xihu harbour a representative mariculture base in the xsb during all four seasons the extra samples i e barracuda sphyraenus flathead grey mullet mugil cephalus and red drum sciaenops ocellatus were collected near the xsb bridge fig 1 in winter which might be affected by pollutants from passing vehicles in addition the detection methods of environmental parameters e g do toc and cod are listed in the supporting information s3 the determination of environmental parameters five litres of seawater samples were gathered by using a 5 l organic glass hydrophore and then the samples were transferred into pretreated brown glass jars and kept in cold storage prior to additional analysis sediment samples 0 5 cm were taken using a stainless steel grab sampler and held in precleaned aluminium foil all fish samples were collected from the cage culture area and wrapped with foil three replicates were collected for each sample and all sediment and fish samples were stored at 20 c 2 3 sample preparation the seawater sediment and fish samples were pretreated in accordance with the chinese national standard methods gb t 26411 2010 hj 805 2016 and gb 5009 265 2016 respectively briefly seawater samples were first filtered through a 0 45 µm filter gf f then 500 ml seawater sample was extracted using a c18 spe cartridge which was preconditioned sequentially with dichloromethane methanol and ultrapure water each with 10 ml and was eluted with dichloromethane 12 ml the prefrozen sediment or fish samples were freeze dried using a vacuum freeze drier sjia 10n 50 china at 48 c and 2 0 pa 72 h and then ground and sieved through a 100 mesh stainless steel sieve sediment sample 2 00 g was ultrasonically extracted with acetone n hexane 1 1 v v and the supernatant was purified with si spe cartridge 1 g 6 ml which was preconditioned with dichloromethane and n hexane and eluted with dichloromethane n hexane 1 9 v v fish sample 1 00 g was ultrasonically extracted with acetonitrile and n hexane saturated acetonitrile and purified in a florisil spe cartridge 1 g 6 ml which was preconditioned with dichloromethane and n hexane the detailed analytical procedures are provided in the supporting information s2 analytical process for samples 2 4 gc ms ms an agilent 7890b gc ms ms with a 7000d mass detector agilent technology usa and a db 5 ms ui capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm was used for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of pahs the injection mode was splitless analyze were carried in the electron impact ionization ei 70 ev and multiple reaction monitoring mrm modes helium 99 999 was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 0 ml min the injection port ion source quadrupole and transfer line temperatures were set at 280 c 280 c 150 c and 280 c respectively the oven was operated at temperature gradient of 70 c for 2 min increased at a 20 c min ramp up to 220 c and then to 300 c at a rate of 5 c min and finally held for 5 min the retention times and parameter conditions of mrm modes are shown in table s1 2 5 quality control and quality assurance the overall experiments were conducted under strict quality control and assurance procedures thus solvent blanks procedural blanks spiked blanks and replicate samples were carried out for every batch of samples and no target compounds were detected in the solvents or procedures detailed results are shown in the supporting information table s2 internal standard calibration was applied to quantify the pah concentrations the limits of detection lods of individual pahs were calculated as being three times the signal versus noise value the lods for seawater sediment and fish samples were 0 02 0 4 ng l 0 005 0 1 and 0 01 0 2 μg kg respectively table s1 the spiked recoveries of 16 pahs for seawater sediment and fish samples ranged from 74 2 to 108 7 84 0 to 117 0 and 83 0 to 106 0 respectively the relative standard deviations rsds were below 9 8 7 4 and 8 6 for seawater sediment and fish samples respectively 2 6 risk assessment procedure the ecological risk of pahs in the aqueous phase was evaluated by the risk quotient rq kalf et al 1997 rq were calculated using the following equation cao et al 2010 1 r q n c s c p a h c q v n c s 2 r q m p c s c p a h c q v m p c s 3 r q p a h s n c s i 1 n r q i n c s r q i n c s 1 4 r q p a h s m p c

and cqv mpcs are the corresponding nc and mpc quality control values of certain pahs in the medium respectively table s3 cao et al 2010 the criteria of the rq methods are shown in table 1 effects range low erl and effects range median erm i e the empirical sediment quality guidelines sqgs screened by noaa are widely used to characterize the ecological risks of deposited pahs table s3 long et al 1995 moreover the mean sqg quotients m erm q were calculated to assess the overall toxicological risks due to the synergistic effect of individual pahs jafarabadi et al 2017 5 m e r m q i 1 n m i e r m i n where mi is the detected concentration in the sediment and ermi is the corresponding screening value table s3 the values of m erm q are divided into four levels i e 0 1 between 0 11 and 0 5 0 51 and 1 5 and 1 5 which represent toxicity probabilities of 9 21 49 and 76 respectively aghadadashi et al 2019 to evaluate the carcinogenic toxicity of pahs in the aquatic environment toxic equivalence quotients relative to bap teqcarc were proposed which can be defined by the following equation jafarabadi et al 2017 6 t e q c a r c c i r p f i where ci is the carcinogenic pah value detected in the environmental medium and rpfi is the relative potency factor for carcinogenic pahs that were screened by the usepa 2012 values of 0 1 0 001 0 1 0 01 1 0 1 and 1 correspond to benzo a anthracene baa chrysene chr benzo k fluoranthene bbf benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap indeno 1 3 c d pyrene icp and dibenz a h anthracene dha respectively to assess human health risks the incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr induced by dietary exposure to pahs was estimated based on bap toxicity usepa 2000 the potency equivalent concentration pec is the sum of the bap equivalent concentration of individual pahs which was calculated by using the toxicity equivalent factor tef table s3 nisbet and lagoy 1992 the formulas are presented as follows 7 i l c r p e c i r e f e d s f c

conducted by spss 22 0 given that the data were verified to have a nonnormal distribution shapiro wilk test pearson s correlation coefficients were adopted spss 22 0 to analyse the correlation between pahs and environmental parameters ocean data view 5 2 0 arcgis 10 7 origin 2021 and graphpad prism 8 were used to visualize the results the wet weight concentrations of pahs for fish samples were transformed from dry weight dw based on a water content of 70 bandowe et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and spatiotemporal variations of pahs in the mariculture environment 3 1 1 in seawater a total of 14 individual pahs were detected in xsb seawater samples the total pah concentrations σpahs in seawater ranged from 54 3 to 103 ng l mean 77 4 11 2 ng l 132 to 357 ng l mean 220 52 8 ng l 149 to 306 ng l mean 207 31 3 ng l and 67 7 to 136 ng l mean 95 5 18 1 ng l in winter spring summer and autumn respectively these results were comparable with that of bohai bay china a typical shallow sea basin in northeastern china 48 0 607 ng l mean 267 ng l and the chaobai rivers in northern china 55 0 882 ng l mean 158 ng l qiao et al 2020 tong et al 2019 whereas the levels were significantly lower than those in yangpu bay china 583 2208 ng l li et al 2015 an important industrial development zone and several large ports are located along the coast according to the classification of σpahs levels in a dissolved phase li et al 2015 the current study pertains to a light level in winter and autumn 50 250 ng l and a moderate level in spring and summer 250 1000 ng l in addition the average concentrations of seven carcinogenic pahs m7 pahs baa chr bbf bkf bap icp and dha iarc 2010 in seawater were 3 97 0 49 ng l 13 7 6 62 ng l 10 5 2 57 ng l and 4 60 0 57 ng l in winter spring summer and autumn respectively m7 pahs obtained in the study area were substantially lower than those of the upstream riverine runoff of the pearl river delta china mean 15 12 ng l zhang et al 2012 which was seriously influenced by urbanization and industrialization among the detected pah congeners the low molecular weight pahs lmw pahs 2 3 rings e g nap acy ace were the dominant species in seawater samples which contributed 88 74 to the total pahs with naphthalene nap 2 ring 72 03 and phenanthrene phe 3 ring 8 19 as the primary congeners the prevalence of lmw pahs in seawater may be attributed to the leakage of diesel and machine oil as a result of the universal existence of fishing boats berths and ship repair shops in xsb jin et al 2020 in addition the low k ow and high water solubility of lmw pahs are also a great contributor to their prevalence in the water phase as fig 2 a shows pah concentrations of seawater in spring and summer were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in autumn and winter this finding agrees with the research conducted by wu et al 2019 which showed that estuarine pah concentrations detected in summer were higher than that in winter from the jiulong river china in addition qin et al 2014 also reported higher σpahs in may and august than in november in the lake chaohu china in general spring and summer are rich seasons for aquaculture activities compared with autumn and winter resulting in elevated organic matter in seawater caused by the sharp increase in biodeposition debris in addition atmospheric wet deposition plum rains and riverine runoff in summer increased pah inputs qin et al 2014 the spatial variations of σpahs in the xsb seawater shows that the inner bay had relatively higher pah levels in all four seasons e g sites 1 and 4 figs 1 and 3 as a semi enclosed narrow bay the capacity of water exchange and self purification severely decreases from the mouth to the inner area with half switching times of less than 5 d 15 20 d and 30 35 d in the mouth middle segment and inner bay of the xsb respectively peng 2013 additionally most of the mariculture areas were gathered at the inner and middle segments of the bay especially in the inner bay e g sites 1 and 2 wu et al 2020 mariculture can seriously affect the hydrodynamic environment and decrease the environmental capacity and tidal prism leading to the difficulty of pollutants towards self purification and outward diffusion moreover the intensive patrol activity of fisherman produces large amounts of pollution discharge e g oil spills and petroleum combustion from fishing boats in mariculture areas in addition another high value area was detected at site 13 which might be mainly due to the terrestrial runoff input of the dasong river the longest meandering river in the basin that brings a great deal of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage into the bay wu et al 2019 it is worth noting that in the fish sample collection areas around site 9 site 24 and site 12 higher pah concentrations were also detected in seawater in spring and summer which might be related to intensive mariculture activities 3 1 2 in sediment all 16 individual pahs were detected in xsb sediment samples with a detection frequency df of 100 for each congener which demonstrated a rich stock of pahs in sediment of the xsb σpahs in sediment varied between 50 1 and 2662 μg kg dw 57 8 and 1307 μg kg dw 158 and 575 μg kg dw and 162 and 618 μg kg dw with mean values of 258 465 μg kg dw 218 239 μg kg dw 324 109 μg kg dw and 302 100 μg kg dw in winter spring summer and autumn respectively the levels obtained in this study were between the levels determined in nan ao island 265 49 to 951 27 μg kg dw a large and diversified mariculture base in south china gu et al 2013 following the category of pah levels in sediments baumard et al 1998 the current finding could be classified among low 0 100 μg kg dw some sites in the middle segment and bay mouth to moderate 100 1000 μg kg dw most sampling sites pollution levels except for two outliers i e site 19 winter 2662 μg kg dw and site 4 spring 1307 μg kg dw which belonged to the high pollution level 1000 5000 μg kg dw m7 pahs observed in sediments were 119 254 μg kg dw 84 0 116 μg kg dw 64 7 50 5 μg kg dw and 64 7 59 8 μg kg dw in winter spring summer and autumn respectively similar to the results in seawater samples the priority components detected in sediments were nap 36 44 and phe 11 50 however the heavy pahs mmw 4 ring and hmw 5 6 ring pahs e g fluoranthene flt 4 ring pyrene pyr 4 ring and bbf 5 ring occupied a higher proportion 46 15 in sediments than that in seawater given their higher hydrophobicity and lipophilicity hmw pahs easily accumulate in fine grained sediments and suspended particles and are finally deposited in sediment soltani et al 2019 heavy pahs which have higher k ow values lgk ow 4 9 are more easily adsorbed in sediment lee et al 2019 resulting in their contents in sediments being higher than those in seawater the seasonal variation of pahs in sediments was minimal compared with that in seawater and no significant seasonal difference p 0 05 was observed in the study area fig 2 b this finding was consistent with the results observed in the middle lower yangtze river china zhao et al 2021 and asan lake of korea lee et al 2019 which showed that the seasonal variation of pahs in the middle lower yangtze river and other organic pollutant phthalate esters in the asan lake of korea in sediment was lower than that in water notably nap was not included when performing the difference analysis in sediment the nap concentrations observed in the study area varied widely among stations and seasons and the values were high enough to affect the entire dataset aghadadashi et al 2019 yang et al 2020 nap has a strong capacity for solvent exchange and biota conducted variations hashtroudi and aghadadashi 2018 furthermore nap could easily migrate on account of the entropy slope caused by environmental conditions aghadadashi et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 the spatial distribution of σpahs in sediment was characterized by high concentrations in the inner bay for all four seasons e g sites 2 4 and 19 in sediments which was consistent with the findings for seawater the residential activities along the inner bay such as chemical industries shipyards near site 19 berths sites 1 2 4 and 19 sewage treatment and power plants occur extensively in these areas which inevitably produced serious environmental pollution in addition the bait drug administration and aquatic animal excrement from the breeding process increased the content of organic matter in sediment thereby making it possible to accumulate such high pah contaminants in particular large amounts of pollutants from the yangtze river flow into the bay along the coastal current through the fodu and niubishan channels yang et al 2018 these pollutants finally settle into sediment with suspended particulate matter under the effect of tidal currents causing slightly higher pah concentrations in bay mouth sediments fig 4 3 1 3 correlation analysis to better interpret the occurrence composition and spatiotemporal characteristics of pahs in seawater and sediment correlation analysis between pah concentrations and environmental variables were conducted in seawater the results of pearson correlation analysis fig 5 showed that nutrients were significantly correlated with pah concentrations p 0 05 and r 0 36 0 42 and 0 27 for no 2 tn and tp respectively wang et al 2020a reported that aquaculture production was an important source of nutrients in coastal seas wu 1995 also concluded that a mass of nitrogen 52 95 and phosphorus 85 are lost in the ambient environment of marine fish farms through the emission of food waste excreta and respiration therefore the strong correlations found in the present study indicated that mariculture might promote the enrichment of pahs within mariculture areas the positive correlation between tn and antibiotic was also demonstrated in mariculture farms from the yellow sea han et al 2020 in this study temperature t p 0 05 r 0 69 and cod p 0 05 r 0 47 also had significant effects on pah concentrations in seawater fig 5 high temperature can enhance the solubility of pahs in seawater and prompt the desorption of suspended particulate matter bound pahs qin et al 2014 in addition the relationship between t and pahs further reflects the seasonal trend of pahs in seawater of the xsb toc is a key variable that can seriously influence the adsorption distribution and equilibrium of pahs in environment in the present study toc was positively correlated with σpahs in seawater p 0 05 r 0 33 fig 5 cod is widely used as an indicator of the pollution level of organic contaminants in water which was further confirmed by the significant positive correlation between cod and pah concentrations in the present study whereas there was no significant correlations p 0 05 r 0 0082 between σpahs and toc in sediments fig s1 which might attribute to the nonequilibrium adsorption process between toc and pahs gu et al 2013 moreover this finding indicated that sediment toc is not the only controlling factor in the study area the poor relationships between toc and pahs in sediment were also observed by wang et al 2020b and gu et al 2013 in addition no significant correlations between σpahs and grain size were observed in the sediment fig s1 fine grained particles 63 μm were found in the xsb sediment and 98 of the samples were identified as fine silt with grain sizes ranging from 3 5 to 18 μm table s4 resulting in minimal impact on the distribution of pahs in sediment the similar result was also found in our previous study zhang et al 2021 in conclusion the findings reveal that the occurrence of pahs in mariculture sediments may depend upon many influencing factors e g migration and mixing hydrological parameters aquaculture activities and land derived inputs 3 2 occurrence and concentrations of pahs in fish samples the concentrations of 16 pah congeners in fish samples collected from the xsb were detected in this study σpahs in different species ranged from 227 to 775 μg kg dw with an average concentration of 434 151 μg kg dw which was in line with the study in the northern south china sea 199 to 606 μg kg dw yu et al 2019 the levels detected in the present study in fish samples were an order of magnitude lower than those from the caspian sea with mean values of 2095 and 1947 μg kg dw in the muscle tissues of persian and stellate sturgeon respectively mashroofeh et al 2015 however it was an order of magnitude higher than that in fish collected from persian gulf iran 3 65 13 81 μg kg dw soltani et al 2019 in addition m7 pah in fish were 26 3 21 9 μg kg dw in the present study which were lower than those in muscle tissue of lutjanus argentimaculatus 115 14 4 μg kg dw lethrinus microdon 141 49 7 μg kg dw and scomberomorus guttatus 136 41 0 μg kg dw from kharg coral island persian gulf iran jafarabadi et al 2019 by employing the classification scale of pah concentrations in fish tissues from noaa the current findings are considered to be at a moderate level 100 1000 μg kg jafarabadi et al 2019 the interspecific differences in the accumulation concentration of pahs among various fish species from the xsb were distinct observed σpahs exhibited higher values in large yellow croaker larimichthys crocea 775 μg kg dw and flathead grey mullet mugil cephalus 637 μg kg dw which were all collected in autumn another greater value of pahs was detected in red drum sciaenops ocellatus 749 μg kg dw collected in winter lower values of 227 and 268 μg kg dw were observed in weever lateolabrax japonicus collected in winter and summer respectively the species specific differences in pah distributions observed in marine culture fish may be attributed to food habits individual habitats feeding rates trophic levels and exposure times growth rates longevity factors and metabolism and biomagnification capacities santana et al 2018 soltani et al 2019 l crocea and s ocellatus are generally benthic feeders and small fish and crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs are the main food of l crocea while the s ocellatus are carnivorous omnivorous species and feed daily on small trash fish and shrimp comparatively higher trophic levels of l crocea 3 7 and s ocellatus 3 7 contributed to the large accumulation of pahs compared with l japonicus 3 1 in addition higher pah concentrations in m cephalus may be related to body size because it has a larger size with a length of 46 cm and weight of 3 04 kg previous studies revealed that body size e g length and weight is an important factor that governs pah accumulation in organisms jafarabadi et al 2019 soltani et al 2019 with a greater body size a given species may have a higher metabolic capacity hence their food uptake rate is higher and the exposure and accumulation of pahs is ultimately intensified soltani et al 2019 the distribution patterns of pah congeners are displayed in fig 6 which shows that all 16 pah congeners were detected in fish samples except for icp and dha which were only observed in spotted maigre nibea albiflora and golden pompano trachinotus ovatus the dfs of all pah congeners were 100 the composition patterns of pah congeners are presented in fig 7 demonstrating that phe 30 90 nap 19 89 and pyr 19 84 were the dominant pahs in fish samples high proportions of nap phe and pyr were also reported in other aquatic organisms e g corals from hainan china yang et al 2020 aquaculture organisms e g fish shrimps crabs and cephalopod from haizhou and lusi fishing ground south yellow sea china zhang et al 2020 and sturgeons from the iranian coastline mashroofeh et al 2015 the dfs and the predominant pah species in fish samples were highly coincident with those detected in seawater samples which indicated that pahs in farming fish might originate from aquatic environments through biological chains direct intake and skin exposure bap is the most carcinogenic pah congener with concentrations ranging from 0 120 to 0 614 μg kg ww mean 0 293 μg kg ww in the present study which was within the maximum level of 2 0 μg kg ww established by the european union for fish tissues efsa 2008 although within the safety threshold the 100 df implied that the farming fish in the xsb had a relatively high bioaccumulation capacity for bap and thus are still of great concern in relation to ring size patterns lmw pahs accounted for 64 47 of the total pahs followed by mmw pahs 34 79 and hmw pahs 0 74 a general rule considered in fish was that water is the dominant source of exposure to organic compounds with low k ow soltani et al 2019 liang et al 2007 relatively higher water solubility of lmw pahs and their high proportion in seawater 88 74 in the present study render them more bioavailable by comparing with hmw or mmw pahs whereas for hmw pahs the low bioavailability and proportion in seawater resulted their lower levels in fish samples in addition hmw pahs could be metabolized rapidly by phase i and ii biotransformation enzymes in fish livers and gills abdel shafy and mansour 2016 jafarabadi et al 2019 fish can metabolize up to 99 of hmw pahs after 24 h of uptake varanasi et al 1989 3 3 source apportionment for pahs in seawater and sediment the diagnostic ratio values of specific pah isomers have been employed to trace the potential sources of pahs as different emissions of pahs with distinct fingerprints in general the 2 3 ring lmw pahs are rich in alkylated homologues and are closely related to natural petroleum leaks or spills indicating petrogenic and low temperature pyrolytic sources however the presence of pahs with four or more condensed aromatic rings implies pyrogenic sources leite et al 2011 sereshk and bakhtiari 2014 herein the ratios of ant ant phe flt flt pyr baa baa chr and icp icp bgp were used to differentiate petroleum and combustion sources simultaneously tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 as shown in fig 8 the pah isomer ratios in different seasons are clustered together in spring 32 of ant ant phe values in seawater samples were below 0 1 which suggested a petroleum source and the corresponding sampling sites were mostly distributed around aquaculture areas e g sites 3 9 and 11 table s5 spring indicating that the petroleum source may be closely related to mariculture activities such as the leakage of diesel and machine oil from fishing boats the sources diagnosed from the flt flt pyr ratios in spring and summer were a mixture of petroleum and petroleum combustion while in winter and autumn they were mainly petroleum combustion fig 8a all samples from all four seasons were found with baa baa chr ratios 0 2 implying a combustion input origin the above results indicated that pahs in seawater originated from a mixed source of petroleum and combustion in particular the mixed sources in spring and summer may be connected to intensive aquaculture production atmospheric wet deposition and riverine runoff which lead to relatively high pah levels in spring and summer for sediment samples as shown in fig 8c and d the plots from all four seasons were less variable and well clustered in the biomass coal combustion area showing that the pah source pattern in sediment was relatively stable and single prominent yunker et al 2002 the coal fired power plant largely contributed the pyrogenic source of pahs in the xsb in addition residents industrial and agricultural activities and domestic pollution also contributed to pyrogenic sources 3 4 risk assessment of pahs 3 4 1 ecotoxicological risks assessment the mean values of rq ncs and rq mpcs of individual pahs in seawater are listed in table s6 referring to table 1 cao et al 2010 mean values of rq ncs for chr in all four seasons and for flt in winter and autumn were less than 1 indicating a negligible ecological risk the rq ncs values for nap acy ace flu phe ant pyr baa bbf bkf bap and bgp in all four seasons were greater than 1 and all the rq mpcs values were 1 indicating that these pah congeners posed a moderate ecological risk jafarabadi et al 2017 reported that the ecological risks of 15 individual pahs were moderate in coastal seawater of the iranian coral islands additionally the rq mpcs value of bbf at site 17 in spring was 1 1 07 indicating that bbf might pose high ecological risks regarding the ecological risk of σpahs the values of rq σpahs ncs ranged from 29 1 to 271 between 1 and 800 table 1 over all four seasons the rq σpahs mpcs values were 0 for all samples except site 17 table s7 which demonstrated that most ecological risks of σpahs were at low risk level in seawater from the xsb this result was in accordance with the study of cao et al 2010 who concluded a low risk for σpahs and moderate risks for nap acy ace flu phe ant flt pyr baa and bbf in the luan river china in the sedimentary environment most pah individuals presented values lower than erl in all four seasons except that nap several sites in summer and autumn and flu site 4 in spring had values between erl and erm indicating that most pah individuals presented low risks in sediments of the xsb aghadadashi et al 2019 in addition all σpah values were lower than the erl guideline values these results suggest that the adverse effects of pahs might rarely occur in sediments of the xsb furthermore the values of m erm q in all sediment samples were below 0 1 table s8 indicating that the probability of toxicity in the sediment of the xsb due to the synergistic effect of pahs was 9 which agreed with the study of aghadadashi et al 2019 the teqcarc values varied from 0 554 to 8 73 ng l and from 1 10 to 366 μg kg for seawater and sediment samples respectively table s9 the observed values in seawater from the xsb were two orders of magnitude lower than those in the coastal seawaters of iranian coral islands persian gulf 45 412 ng l jafarabadi et al 2017 and the values for sediment were notably lower than those of the drapetsona keratsini coastal zone greece 88 2578 μg kg kapsimalis et al 2014 loire river france 283 6290 μg kg bertrand et al 2015 and taranto gulf italy 299 47672 μg kg annicchiarico et al 2011 these results suggested that the toxicity risks were low in the aquatic environment of the xsb the toxicity risk based on individual teqcarc values in descending order is listed as follows bap 76 60 bbf 13 66 baa 8 69 bkf 0 96 chr 0 09 in seawater for sediment the values can be ranked as bap 62 18 dha 14 36 bbf 11 29 icp 6 10 baa 5 69 bkf 0 31 chr 0 07 and the two trends are highly consistent in general bap had the highest toxicity risk level among carcinogenic pahs in xsb 3 4 2 health risk assessment the pec of the total pahs in fish samples ranged from 0 36 to 1 62 μg kg ww table s10 and the values of 53 85 samples exceeded the us epa screening value 0 67 μg kg ww this result indicated that potential toxic effects on human beings via fish consumption could be induced in xsb more importantly the variation trend of pec values was different from that of total pah concentrations in the current study for example the maximum pec value was found in black sea bass centropristis striata which showed a medium level 536 μg kg dw of total pah concentrations 227 775 μg kg dw but a high level 69 7 μg kg dw of carcinogenic pahs 4 62 76 4 μg kg dw therefore considering the toxicity risk the level of carcinogenic pahs especially bap and dha with the maximum tef value should be noteworthily focused rather than total pahs ding et al 2012 and shi et al 2016 ever reported that pec could be a better index for evaluating the potential toxicity than total pah concentrations the ilcr values that resulted from lifetime exposure to pahs for adults by fish consumption in the xsb ranged from 7 27 10 7 to 3 24 10 6 table s10 which were higher than those in wild marine fish from the northern south china sea yu et al 2019 whereas were lower than those in fish from poyang lake china zhao et al 2014 values 10 6 10 6 to 10 4 and 10 4 were deemed acceptable of concern and unacceptable respectively the mean ilcr value 1 64 10 6 suggested that the potential cancer risk from fish consumption in the xsb should be considered in addition various ecopollutants could be exposed to humans through dietary intake together with pahs which might result in synergistic toxic effects thus additional and long term risk assessments should be seriously considered 4 conclusion in this study pahs in the aquatic ecosystem of a typical and yield mariculture base that is xsb were investigated comprehensively the pah concentrations in the study area were classified as being of moderate pollution levels implying that pahs may be a potential hazardous pollutant in the xsb and could have adverse effects on aquaculture or even on consuming groups in addition to hydrological conditions and industrial activities aquaculture also had a certain impact on pahs accumulation in the xsb among all 15 fish species relatively high levels of pahs in the muscle tissue of l crocea s ocellatus and m cephalus were observed which were mainly correlated with their food and feeding type and living patterns pahs in seawater and sediment originated from petroleum combustion input and biomass coal combustion respectively the results of rq and sqg exhibited low to moderate ecological risks of pahs the teqcarc results demonstrated the low toxicity and carcinogenic risks of pahs in seawater and sediment from the xsb the calculated ilcr values were far less than the unacceptable value however the potential cancer risks via fish consumption in the xsb still deserve continued attention furthermore carcinogenic pahs heavy pahs are more likely to be transferred to the liver and metabolized with toxic byproducts therefore the carcinogenic risk to the liver should be further evaluated overall our findings reveal the residual characteristics and potential risks of pahs in the xsb and provide data

16673,the spatiotemporal variations influencing factors and potential sources as well as the ecological health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs were systematically investigated in seawater sediment and fish from xiangshan bay china one of the most important and oldest domestic marine aquaculture bases the average concentrations of σpahs in seawater sediment and fish were 150 70 0 ng l 276 271 μg kg dry weight dw and 434 151 μg kg dw respectively naphthalene phenanthrene fluoranthene benzo b fluoranthene and pyrene were the dominant contaminants in all samples the highest pah concentrations in the seawater and sediment samples occurred in the inner bay where the mariculture and industry are clustered seasonal differences were observed in the seawater samples but not in the sediment samples among all 15 fish species large yellow croaker larimichthys crocea 775 μg kg dw red drum sciaenops ocellatus 749 μg kg dw and flathead grey mullet mugil cephalus 637 μg kg dw had relatively high pah accumulation concentrations in muscle tissue according to the molecular diagnostic ratio method the pahs in seawater mainly originated from a mixed source of petroleum and combustion whereas biomass coal combustion sources were identified for sediment the results obtained from the risk quotient for seawater sediment quality guidelines and toxic equivalence quotients for seawater and sediment methods showed that the ecological risks posed by pahs were generally at a low to moderate level potentially toxic effects existed from pah contaminated fish consumption and the resulting potential carcinogenic risk was also slightly higher than the recommended guidelines 10 6 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons spatiotemporal characteristics source apportionment ecological risk assessment mariculture environment 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs a class of semi volatile organic contaminants with potential teratogenicity carcinogenicity and mutagenicity have attracted a great amount of public attention for many decades jafarabadi et al 2019 pahs are primarily derived from anthropogenic activities including the incomplete combustion of organic matter e g oil fossil fuels and wood and the release of crude oil frapiccini et al 2018 pahs are ubiquitous in the environment including water bodies sediments aquatic products and even humans jafarabadi et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 pahs can transfer into the coastal areas through the atmospheric deposition dry and wet river runoff and sewage discharge frapiccini et al 2020 in addition the spatial distributions of pahs are affected by their air sea or air sediment depositions water flow rates water levels and prevailing physicochemical properties at the site e g the organic content therefore considering their persistence accumulation and toxicity the adverse health and ecological effects of pahs on humans and environmental habitants are of serious concern estuaries and bays are important aquatic ecosystems that are considered to be the ultimate reservoirs for terrigenous pollutants e g heavy metals organic contaminants zhao et al 2018 li et al 2015 recently pahs have been widely detected in aquatic ecosystems and aquatic organisms resulting in the strong bioconcentration along the food web specifically fish are recognized as top consumers with a relatively long lifespan in aquatic ecosystems yu et al 2019 as reported the production and consumption of aquatic products e g economic fish and shellfish are increasing yearly wang et al 2020a the consumption of aquatic products contaminated by pahs could cause lasting damage to human health thus elucidating the status potential sources and risks of pahs in typical aquatic ecosystems is crucial and can provide valuable references xiangshan bay xsb in the east china sea is known as the big fish pond it is a long narrow semi enclosed influential and high yield national aquaculture base lin et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 however the environmental quality of the xsb is seriously and adversely affected by intensive anthropogenic activities including industry shipbuilding and power enterprises agricultural sewage discharges mariculture and fishing boat activities and urbanization zhao et al 2018 numerous studies have reported environmental pollutants in the xsb such as polychlorinated biphenyls lin et al 2020 heavy metals zhao et al 2018 and microplastics wu et al 2020 although pah contaminants have been reported in the xsb by investigations of the pollution characteristics of pahs in sediment and larimichthys crocea wang et al 2019 wang et al 2015 comprehensive studies on the distribution of pahs and corresponding risk assessments in the multiple environmental media present in economic and fishing areas in the xsb are lacking in the current study pahs spatiotemporal variations in seawater and sediment as well as the concentrations in different fish species in the xsb were first investigated in addition the potential sources and ecological health risks of pahs were evaluated the data obtained in this study will provide valuable references for illustrating and preventing the ecological and health risks of pahs in typical bays 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sixteen pahs usepa priority pahs and 5

were carefully selected to represent the xsb space and thus covered breeding and nonbreeding areas fig 1 seawater and sediment samples were collected in january may august and november 2019 most of the fish samples were collected from xihu harbour a representative mariculture base in the xsb during all four seasons the extra samples i e barracuda sphyraenus flathead grey mullet mugil cephalus and red drum sciaenops ocellatus were collected near the xsb bridge fig 1 in winter which might be affected by pollutants from passing vehicles in addition the detection methods of environmental parameters e g do toc and cod are listed in the supporting information s3 the determination of environmental parameters five litres of seawater samples were gathered by using a 5 l organic glass hydrophore and then the samples were transferred into pretreated brown glass jars and kept in cold storage prior to additional analysis sediment samples 0 5 cm were taken using a stainless steel grab sampler and held in precleaned aluminium foil all fish samples were collected from the cage culture area and wrapped with foil three replicates were collected for each sample and all sediment and fish samples were stored at 20 c 2 3 sample preparation the seawater sediment and fish samples were pretreated in accordance with the chinese national standard methods gb t 26411 2010 hj 805 2016 and gb 5009 265 2016 respectively briefly seawater samples were first filtered through a 0 45 µm filter gf f then 500 ml seawater sample was extracted using a c18 spe cartridge which was preconditioned sequentially with dichloromethane methanol and ultrapure water each with 10 ml and was eluted with dichloromethane 12 ml the prefrozen sediment or fish samples were freeze dried using a vacuum freeze drier sjia 10n 50 china at 48 c and 2 0 pa 72 h and then ground and sieved through a 100 mesh stainless steel sieve sediment sample 2 00 g was ultrasonically extracted with acetone n hexane 1 1 v v and the supernatant was purified with si spe cartridge 1 g 6 ml which was preconditioned with dichloromethane and n hexane and eluted with dichloromethane n hexane 1 9 v v fish sample 1 00 g was ultrasonically extracted with acetonitrile and n hexane saturated acetonitrile and purified in a florisil spe cartridge 1 g 6 ml which was preconditioned with dichloromethane and n hexane the detailed analytical procedures are provided in the supporting information s2 analytical process for samples 2 4 gc ms ms an agilent 7890b gc ms ms with a 7000d mass detector agilent technology usa and a db 5 ms ui capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm was used for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of pahs the injection mode was splitless analyze were carried in the electron impact ionization ei 70 ev and multiple reaction monitoring mrm modes helium 99 999 was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 0 ml min the injection port ion source quadrupole and transfer line temperatures were set at 280 c 280 c 150 c and 280 c respectively the oven was operated at temperature gradient of 70 c for 2 min increased at a 20 c min ramp up to 220 c and then to 300 c at a rate of 5 c min and finally held for 5 min the retention times and parameter conditions of mrm modes are shown in table s1 2 5 quality control and quality assurance the overall experiments were conducted under strict quality control and assurance procedures thus solvent blanks procedural blanks spiked blanks and replicate samples were carried out for every batch of samples and no target compounds were detected in the solvents or procedures detailed results are shown in the supporting information table s2 internal standard calibration was applied to quantify the pah concentrations the limits of detection lods of individual pahs were calculated as being three times the signal versus noise value the lods for seawater sediment and fish samples were 0 02 0 4 ng l 0 005 0 1 and 0 01 0 2 μg kg respectively table s1 the spiked recoveries of 16 pahs for seawater sediment and fish samples ranged from 74 2 to 108 7 84 0 to 117 0 and 83 0 to 106 0 respectively the relative standard deviations rsds were below 9 8 7 4 and 8 6 for seawater sediment and fish samples respectively 2 6 risk assessment procedure the ecological risk of pahs in the aqueous phase was evaluated by the risk quotient rq kalf et al 1997 rq were calculated using the following equation cao et al 2010 1 r q n c s c p a h c q v n c s 2 r q m p c s c p a h c q v m p c s 3 r q p a h s n c s i 1 n r q i n c s r q i n c s 1 4 r q p a h s m p c

and cqv mpcs are the corresponding nc and mpc quality control values of certain pahs in the medium respectively table s3 cao et al 2010 the criteria of the rq methods are shown in table 1 effects range low erl and effects range median erm i e the empirical sediment quality guidelines sqgs screened by noaa are widely used to characterize the ecological risks of deposited pahs table s3 long et al 1995 moreover the mean sqg quotients m erm q were calculated to assess the overall toxicological risks due to the synergistic effect of individual pahs jafarabadi et al 2017 5 m e r m q i 1 n m i e r m i n where mi is the detected concentration in the sediment and ermi is the corresponding screening value table s3 the values of m erm q are divided into four levels i e 0 1 between 0 11 and 0 5 0 51 and 1 5 and 1 5 which represent toxicity probabilities of 9 21 49 and 76 respectively aghadadashi et al 2019 to evaluate the carcinogenic toxicity of pahs in the aquatic environment toxic equivalence quotients relative to bap teqcarc were proposed which can be defined by the following equation jafarabadi et al 2017 6 t e q c a r c c i r p f i where ci is the carcinogenic pah value detected in the environmental medium and rpfi is the relative potency factor for carcinogenic pahs that were screened by the usepa 2012 values of 0 1 0 001 0 1 0 01 1 0 1 and 1 correspond to benzo a anthracene baa chrysene chr benzo k fluoranthene bbf benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo a pyrene bap indeno 1 3 c d pyrene icp and dibenz a h anthracene dha respectively to assess human health risks the incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr induced by dietary exposure to pahs was estimated based on bap toxicity usepa 2000 the potency equivalent concentration pec is the sum of the bap equivalent concentration of individual pahs which was calculated by using the toxicity equivalent factor tef table s3 nisbet and lagoy 1992 the formulas are presented as follows 7 i l c r p e c i r e f e d s f c

conducted by spss 22 0 given that the data were verified to have a nonnormal distribution shapiro wilk test pearson s correlation coefficients were adopted spss 22 0 to analyse the correlation between pahs and environmental parameters ocean data view 5 2 0 arcgis 10 7 origin 2021 and graphpad prism 8 were used to visualize the results the wet weight concentrations of pahs for fish samples were transformed from dry weight dw based on a water content of 70 bandowe et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and spatiotemporal variations of pahs in the mariculture environment 3 1 1 in seawater a total of 14 individual pahs were detected in xsb seawater samples the total pah concentrations σpahs in seawater ranged from 54 3 to 103 ng l mean 77 4 11 2 ng l 132 to 357 ng l mean 220 52 8 ng l 149 to 306 ng l mean 207 31 3 ng l and 67 7 to 136 ng l mean 95 5 18 1 ng l in winter spring summer and autumn respectively these results were comparable with that of bohai bay china a typical shallow sea basin in northeastern china 48 0 607 ng l mean 267 ng l and the chaobai rivers in northern china 55 0 882 ng l mean 158 ng l qiao et al 2020 tong et al 2019 whereas the levels were significantly lower than those in yangpu bay china 583 2208 ng l li et al 2015 an important industrial development zone and several large ports are located along the coast according to the classification of σpahs levels in a dissolved phase li et al 2015 the current study pertains to a light level in winter and autumn 50 250 ng l and a moderate level in spring and summer 250 1000 ng l in addition the average concentrations of seven carcinogenic pahs m7 pahs baa chr bbf bkf bap icp and dha iarc 2010 in seawater were 3 97 0 49 ng l 13 7 6 62 ng l 10 5 2 57 ng l and 4 60 0 57 ng l in winter spring summer and autumn respectively m7 pahs obtained in the study area were substantially lower than those of the upstream riverine runoff of the pearl river delta china mean 15 12 ng l zhang et al 2012 which was seriously influenced by urbanization and industrialization among the detected pah congeners the low molecular weight pahs lmw pahs 2 3 rings e g nap acy ace were the dominant species in seawater samples which contributed 88 74 to the total pahs with naphthalene nap 2 ring 72 03 and phenanthrene phe 3 ring 8 19 as the primary congeners the prevalence of lmw pahs in seawater may be attributed to the leakage of diesel and machine oil as a result of the universal existence of fishing boats berths and ship repair shops in xsb jin et al 2020 in addition the low k ow and high water solubility of lmw pahs are also a great contributor to their prevalence in the water phase as fig 2 a shows pah concentrations of seawater in spring and summer were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in autumn and winter this finding agrees with the research conducted by wu et al 2019 which showed that estuarine pah concentrations detected in summer were higher than that in winter from the jiulong river china in addition qin et al 2014 also reported higher σpahs in may and august than in november in the lake chaohu china in general spring and summer are rich seasons for aquaculture activities compared with autumn and winter resulting in elevated organic matter in seawater caused by the sharp increase in biodeposition debris in addition atmospheric wet deposition plum rains and riverine runoff in summer increased pah inputs qin et al 2014 the spatial variations of σpahs in the xsb seawater shows that the inner bay had relatively higher pah levels in all four seasons e g sites 1 and 4 figs 1 and 3 as a semi enclosed narrow bay the capacity of water exchange and self purification severely decreases from the mouth to the inner area with half switching times of less than 5 d 15 20 d and 30 35 d in the mouth middle segment and inner bay of the xsb respectively peng 2013 additionally most of the mariculture areas were gathered at the inner and middle segments of the bay especially in the inner bay e g sites 1 and 2 wu et al 2020 mariculture can seriously affect the hydrodynamic environment and decrease the environmental capacity and tidal prism leading to the difficulty of pollutants towards self purification and outward diffusion moreover the intensive patrol activity of fisherman produces large amounts of pollution discharge e g oil spills and petroleum combustion from fishing boats in mariculture areas in addition another high value area was detected at site 13 which might be mainly due to the terrestrial runoff input of the dasong river the longest meandering river in the basin that brings a great deal of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage into the bay wu et al 2019 it is worth noting that in the fish sample collection areas around site 9 site 24 and site 12 higher pah concentrations were also detected in seawater in spring and summer which might be related to intensive mariculture activities 3 1 2 in sediment all 16 individual pahs were detected in xsb sediment samples with a detection frequency df of 100 for each congener which demonstrated a rich stock of pahs in sediment of the xsb σpahs in sediment varied between 50 1 and 2662 μg kg dw 57 8 and 1307 μg kg dw 158 and 575 μg kg dw and 162 and 618 μg kg dw with mean values of 258 465 μg kg dw 218 239 μg kg dw 324 109 μg kg dw and 302 100 μg kg dw in winter spring summer and autumn respectively the levels obtained in this study were between the levels determined in nan ao island 265 49 to 951 27 μg kg dw a large and diversified mariculture base in south china gu et al 2013 following the category of pah levels in sediments baumard et al 1998 the current finding could be classified among low 0 100 μg kg dw some sites in the middle segment and bay mouth to moderate 100 1000 μg kg dw most sampling sites pollution levels except for two outliers i e site 19 winter 2662 μg kg dw and site 4 spring 1307 μg kg dw which belonged to the high pollution level 1000 5000 μg kg dw m7 pahs observed in sediments were 119 254 μg kg dw 84 0 116 μg kg dw 64 7 50 5 μg kg dw and 64 7 59 8 μg kg dw in winter spring summer and autumn respectively similar to the results in seawater samples the priority components detected in sediments were nap 36 44 and phe 11 50 however the heavy pahs mmw 4 ring and hmw 5 6 ring pahs e g fluoranthene flt 4 ring pyrene pyr 4 ring and bbf 5 ring occupied a higher proportion 46 15 in sediments than that in seawater given their higher hydrophobicity and lipophilicity hmw pahs easily accumulate in fine grained sediments and suspended particles and are finally deposited in sediment soltani et al 2019 heavy pahs which have higher k ow values lgk ow 4 9 are more easily adsorbed in sediment lee et al 2019 resulting in their contents in sediments being higher than those in seawater the seasonal variation of pahs in sediments was minimal compared with that in seawater and no significant seasonal difference p 0 05 was observed in the study area fig 2 b this finding was consistent with the results observed in the middle lower yangtze river china zhao et al 2021 and asan lake of korea lee et al 2019 which showed that the seasonal variation of pahs in the middle lower yangtze river and other organic pollutant phthalate esters in the asan lake of korea in sediment was lower than that in water notably nap was not included when performing the difference analysis in sediment the nap concentrations observed in the study area varied widely among stations and seasons and the values were high enough to affect the entire dataset aghadadashi et al 2019 yang et al 2020 nap has a strong capacity for solvent exchange and biota conducted variations hashtroudi and aghadadashi 2018 furthermore nap could easily migrate on account of the entropy slope caused by environmental conditions aghadadashi et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 the spatial distribution of σpahs in sediment was characterized by high concentrations in the inner bay for all four seasons e g sites 2 4 and 19 in sediments which was consistent with the findings for seawater the residential activities along the inner bay such as chemical industries shipyards near site 19 berths sites 1 2 4 and 19 sewage treatment and power plants occur extensively in these areas which inevitably produced serious environmental pollution in addition the bait drug administration and aquatic animal excrement from the breeding process increased the content of organic matter in sediment thereby making it possible to accumulate such high pah contaminants in particular large amounts of pollutants from the yangtze river flow into the bay along the coastal current through the fodu and niubishan channels yang et al 2018 these pollutants finally settle into sediment with suspended particulate matter under the effect of tidal currents causing slightly higher pah concentrations in bay mouth sediments fig 4 3 1 3 correlation analysis to better interpret the occurrence composition and spatiotemporal characteristics of pahs in seawater and sediment correlation analysis between pah concentrations and environmental variables were conducted in seawater the results of pearson correlation analysis fig 5 showed that nutrients were significantly correlated with pah concentrations p 0 05 and r 0 36 0 42 and 0 27 for no 2 tn and tp respectively wang et al 2020a reported that aquaculture production was an important source of nutrients in coastal seas wu 1995 also concluded that a mass of nitrogen 52 95 and phosphorus 85 are lost in the ambient environment of marine fish farms through the emission of food waste excreta and respiration therefore the strong correlations found in the present study indicated that mariculture might promote the enrichment of pahs within mariculture areas the positive correlation between tn and antibiotic was also demonstrated in mariculture farms from the yellow sea han et al 2020 in this study temperature t p 0 05 r 0 69 and cod p 0 05 r 0 47 also had significant effects on pah concentrations in seawater fig 5 high temperature can enhance the solubility of pahs in seawater and prompt the desorption of suspended particulate matter bound pahs qin et al 2014 in addition the relationship between t and pahs further reflects the seasonal trend of pahs in seawater of the xsb toc is a key variable that can seriously influence the adsorption distribution and equilibrium of pahs in environment in the present study toc was positively correlated with σpahs in seawater p 0 05 r 0 33 fig 5 cod is widely used as an indicator of the pollution level of organic contaminants in water which was further confirmed by the significant positive correlation between cod and pah concentrations in the present study whereas there was no significant correlations p 0 05 r 0 0082 between σpahs and toc in sediments fig s1 which might attribute to the nonequilibrium adsorption process between toc and pahs gu et al 2013 moreover this finding indicated that sediment toc is not the only controlling factor in the study area the poor relationships between toc and pahs in sediment were also observed by wang et al 2020b and gu et al 2013 in addition no significant correlations between σpahs and grain size were observed in the sediment fig s1 fine grained particles 63 μm were found in the xsb sediment and 98 of the samples were identified as fine silt with grain sizes ranging from 3 5 to 18 μm table s4 resulting in minimal impact on the distribution of pahs in sediment the similar result was also found in our previous study zhang et al 2021 in conclusion the findings reveal that the occurrence of pahs in mariculture sediments may depend upon many influencing factors e g migration and mixing hydrological parameters aquaculture activities and land derived inputs 3 2 occurrence and concentrations of pahs in fish samples the concentrations of 16 pah congeners in fish samples collected from the xsb were detected in this study σpahs in different species ranged from 227 to 775 μg kg dw with an average concentration of 434 151 μg kg dw which was in line with the study in the northern south china sea 199 to 606 μg kg dw yu et al 2019 the levels detected in the present study in fish samples were an order of magnitude lower than those from the caspian sea with mean values of 2095 and 1947 μg kg dw in the muscle tissues of persian and stellate sturgeon respectively mashroofeh et al 2015 however it was an order of magnitude higher than that in fish collected from persian gulf iran 3 65 13 81 μg kg dw soltani et al 2019 in addition m7 pah in fish were 26 3 21 9 μg kg dw in the present study which were lower than those in muscle tissue of lutjanus argentimaculatus 115 14 4 μg kg dw lethrinus microdon 141 49 7 μg kg dw and scomberomorus guttatus 136 41 0 μg kg dw from kharg coral island persian gulf iran jafarabadi et al 2019 by employing the classification scale of pah concentrations in fish tissues from noaa the current findings are considered to be at a moderate level 100 1000 μg kg jafarabadi et al 2019 the interspecific differences in the accumulation concentration of pahs among various fish species from the xsb were distinct observed σpahs exhibited higher values in large yellow croaker larimichthys crocea 775 μg kg dw and flathead grey mullet mugil cephalus 637 μg kg dw which were all collected in autumn another greater value of pahs was detected in red drum sciaenops ocellatus 749 μg kg dw collected in winter lower values of 227 and 268 μg kg dw were observed in weever lateolabrax japonicus collected in winter and summer respectively the species specific differences in pah distributions observed in marine culture fish may be attributed to food habits individual habitats feeding rates trophic levels and exposure times growth rates longevity factors and metabolism and biomagnification capacities santana et al 2018 soltani et al 2019 l crocea and s ocellatus are generally benthic feeders and small fish and crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs are the main food of l crocea while the s ocellatus are carnivorous omnivorous species and feed daily on small trash fish and shrimp comparatively higher trophic levels of l crocea 3 7 and s ocellatus 3 7 contributed to the large accumulation of pahs compared with l japonicus 3 1 in addition higher pah concentrations in m cephalus may be related to body size because it has a larger size with a length of 46 cm and weight of 3 04 kg previous studies revealed that body size e g length and weight is an important factor that governs pah accumulation in organisms jafarabadi et al 2019 soltani et al 2019 with a greater body size a given species may have a higher metabolic capacity hence their food uptake rate is higher and the exposure and accumulation of pahs is ultimately intensified soltani et al 2019 the distribution patterns of pah congeners are displayed in fig 6 which shows that all 16 pah congeners were detected in fish samples except for icp and dha which were only observed in spotted maigre nibea albiflora and golden pompano trachinotus ovatus the dfs of all pah congeners were 100 the composition patterns of pah congeners are presented in fig 7 demonstrating that phe 30 90 nap 19 89 and pyr 19 84 were the dominant pahs in fish samples high proportions of nap phe and pyr were also reported in other aquatic organisms e g corals from hainan china yang et al 2020 aquaculture organisms e g fish shrimps crabs and cephalopod from haizhou and lusi fishing ground south yellow sea china zhang et al 2020 and sturgeons from the iranian coastline mashroofeh et al 2015 the dfs and the predominant pah species in fish samples were highly coincident with those detected in seawater samples which indicated that pahs in farming fish might originate from aquatic environments through biological chains direct intake and skin exposure bap is the most carcinogenic pah congener with concentrations ranging from 0 120 to 0 614 μg kg ww mean 0 293 μg kg ww in the present study which was within the maximum level of 2 0 μg kg ww established by the european union for fish tissues efsa 2008 although within the safety threshold the 100 df implied that the farming fish in the xsb had a relatively high bioaccumulation capacity for bap and thus are still of great concern in relation to ring size patterns lmw pahs accounted for 64 47 of the total pahs followed by mmw pahs 34 79 and hmw pahs 0 74 a general rule considered in fish was that water is the dominant source of exposure to organic compounds with low k ow soltani et al 2019 liang et al 2007 relatively higher water solubility of lmw pahs and their high proportion in seawater 88 74 in the present study render them more bioavailable by comparing with hmw or mmw pahs whereas for hmw pahs the low bioavailability and proportion in seawater resulted their lower levels in fish samples in addition hmw pahs could be metabolized rapidly by phase i and ii biotransformation enzymes in fish livers and gills abdel shafy and mansour 2016 jafarabadi et al 2019 fish can metabolize up to 99 of hmw pahs after 24 h of uptake varanasi et al 1989 3 3 source apportionment for pahs in seawater and sediment the diagnostic ratio values of specific pah isomers have been employed to trace the potential sources of pahs as different emissions of pahs with distinct fingerprints in general the 2 3 ring lmw pahs are rich in alkylated homologues and are closely related to natural petroleum leaks or spills indicating petrogenic and low temperature pyrolytic sources however the presence of pahs with four or more condensed aromatic rings implies pyrogenic sources leite et al 2011 sereshk and bakhtiari 2014 herein the ratios of ant ant phe flt flt pyr baa baa chr and icp icp bgp were used to differentiate petroleum and combustion sources simultaneously tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 as shown in fig 8 the pah isomer ratios in different seasons are clustered together in spring 32 of ant ant phe values in seawater samples were below 0 1 which suggested a petroleum source and the corresponding sampling sites were mostly distributed around aquaculture areas e g sites 3 9 and 11 table s5 spring indicating that the petroleum source may be closely related to mariculture activities such as the leakage of diesel and machine oil from fishing boats the sources diagnosed from the flt flt pyr ratios in spring and summer were a mixture of petroleum and petroleum combustion while in winter and autumn they were mainly petroleum combustion fig 8a all samples from all four seasons were found with baa baa chr ratios 0 2 implying a combustion input origin the above results indicated that pahs in seawater originated from a mixed source of petroleum and combustion in particular the mixed sources in spring and summer may be connected to intensive aquaculture production atmospheric wet deposition and riverine runoff which lead to relatively high pah levels in spring and summer for sediment samples as shown in fig 8c and d the plots from all four seasons were less variable and well clustered in the biomass coal combustion area showing that the pah source pattern in sediment was relatively stable and single prominent yunker et al 2002 the coal fired power plant largely contributed the pyrogenic source of pahs in the xsb in addition residents industrial and agricultural activities and domestic pollution also contributed to pyrogenic sources 3 4 risk assessment of pahs 3 4 1 ecotoxicological risks assessment the mean values of rq ncs and rq mpcs of individual pahs in seawater are listed in table s6 referring to table 1 cao et al 2010 mean values of rq ncs for chr in all four seasons and for flt in winter and autumn were less than 1 indicating a negligible ecological risk the rq ncs values for nap acy ace flu phe ant pyr baa bbf bkf bap and bgp in all four seasons were greater than 1 and all the rq mpcs values were 1 indicating that these pah congeners posed a moderate ecological risk jafarabadi et al 2017 reported that the ecological risks of 15 individual pahs were moderate in coastal seawater of the iranian coral islands additionally the rq mpcs value of bbf at site 17 in spring was 1 1 07 indicating that bbf might pose high ecological risks regarding the ecological risk of σpahs the values of rq σpahs ncs ranged from 29 1 to 271 between 1 and 800 table 1 over all four seasons the rq σpahs mpcs values were 0 for all samples except site 17 table s7 which demonstrated that most ecological risks of σpahs were at low risk level in seawater from the xsb this result was in accordance with the study of cao et al 2010 who concluded a low risk for σpahs and moderate risks for nap acy ace flu phe ant flt pyr baa and bbf in the luan river china in the sedimentary environment most pah individuals presented values lower than erl in all four seasons except that nap several sites in summer and autumn and flu site 4 in spring had values between erl and erm indicating that most pah individuals presented low risks in sediments of the xsb aghadadashi et al 2019 in addition all σpah values were lower than the erl guideline values these results suggest that the adverse effects of pahs might rarely occur in sediments of the xsb furthermore the values of m erm q in all sediment samples were below 0 1 table s8 indicating that the probability of toxicity in the sediment of the xsb due to the synergistic effect of pahs was 9 which agreed with the study of aghadadashi et al 2019 the teqcarc values varied from 0 554 to 8 73 ng l and from 1 10 to 366 μg kg for seawater and sediment samples respectively table s9 the observed values in seawater from the xsb were two orders of magnitude lower than those in the coastal seawaters of iranian coral islands persian gulf 45 412 ng l jafarabadi et al 2017 and the values for sediment were notably lower than those of the drapetsona keratsini coastal zone greece 88 2578 μg kg kapsimalis et al 2014 loire river france 283 6290 μg kg bertrand et al 2015 and taranto gulf italy 299 47672 μg kg annicchiarico et al 2011 these results suggested that the toxicity risks were low in the aquatic environment of the xsb the toxicity risk based on individual teqcarc values in descending order is listed as follows bap 76 60 bbf 13 66 baa 8 69 bkf 0 96 chr 0 09 in seawater for sediment the values can be ranked as bap 62 18 dha 14 36 bbf 11 29 icp 6 10 baa 5 69 bkf 0 31 chr 0 07 and the two trends are highly consistent in general bap had the highest toxicity risk level among carcinogenic pahs in xsb 3 4 2 health risk assessment the pec of the total pahs in fish samples ranged from 0 36 to 1 62 μg kg ww table s10 and the values of 53 85 samples exceeded the us epa screening value 0 67 μg kg ww this result indicated that potential toxic effects on human beings via fish consumption could be induced in xsb more importantly the variation trend of pec values was different from that of total pah concentrations in the current study for example the maximum pec value was found in black sea bass centropristis striata which showed a medium level 536 μg kg dw of total pah concentrations 227 775 μg kg dw but a high level 69 7 μg kg dw of carcinogenic pahs 4 62 76 4 μg kg dw therefore considering the toxicity risk the level of carcinogenic pahs especially bap and dha with the maximum tef value should be noteworthily focused rather than total pahs ding et al 2012 and shi et al 2016 ever reported that pec could be a better index for evaluating the potential toxicity than total pah concentrations the ilcr values that resulted from lifetime exposure to pahs for adults by fish consumption in the xsb ranged from 7 27 10 7 to 3 24 10 6 table s10 which were higher than those in wild marine fish from the northern south china sea yu et al 2019 whereas were lower than those in fish from poyang lake china zhao et al 2014 values 10 6 10 6 to 10 4 and 10 4 were deemed acceptable of concern and unacceptable respectively the mean ilcr value 1 64 10 6 suggested that the potential cancer risk from fish consumption in the xsb should be considered in addition various ecopollutants could be exposed to humans through dietary intake together with pahs which might result in synergistic toxic effects thus additional and long term risk assessments should be seriously considered 4 conclusion in this study pahs in the aquatic ecosystem of a typical and yield mariculture base that is xsb were investigated comprehensively the pah concentrations in the study area were classified as being of moderate pollution levels implying that pahs may be a potential hazardous pollutant in the xsb and could have adverse effects on aquaculture or even on consuming groups in addition to hydrological conditions and industrial activities aquaculture also had a certain impact on pahs accumulation in the xsb among all 15 fish species relatively high levels of pahs in the muscle tissue of l crocea s ocellatus and m cephalus were observed which were mainly correlated with their food and feeding type and living patterns pahs in seawater and sediment originated from petroleum combustion input and biomass coal combustion respectively the results of rq and sqg exhibited low to moderate ecological risks of pahs the teqcarc results demonstrated the low toxicity and carcinogenic risks of pahs in seawater and sediment from the xsb the calculated ilcr values were far less than the unacceptable value however the potential cancer risks via fish consumption in the xsb still deserve continued attention furthermore carcinogenic pahs heavy pahs are more likely to be transferred to the liver and metabolized with toxic byproducts therefore the carcinogenic risk to the liver should be further evaluated overall our findings reveal the residual characteristics and potential risks of pahs in the xsb and provide data

abstract keywords biomarkers sewer reactors stability wastewater based epidemiology 1 introduction physical pain is almost an unavoidable part of human life it is one of the major reasons patients seek medical assistance fishman 2007 treatment of pain is complex but pain medications known as analgesics are considered effective and quick treatment options to relieve pain analgesics comprise mainly non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and opioids brower 2000 while analgesics act to relieve body pain misuse and overdose of analgesics and specifically opioids can pose a health burden and additional mortality to our communities berterame et al 2016 assessing the prevalence of pain in a community or population can be challenging individual pain assessment tools provide the scope to measure pain relland et al 2019 but are often limited to an individual or personal scale we recently proposed a new theoretical method through the wastewater based measurement of the population treated pain burden ahmed et al 2020b a theoretical basis for quantifying analgesic drugs in wastewater followed by normalisation of the relative drug potency to estimate community pain burden was presented ahmed et al 2020b the proposed method would allow us to estimate analgesics and rank the population treated pain burden area within and between populations wastewater based epidemiology wbe entails the systematic sampling and analysis of chemical markers in wastewater to estimate human consumption of or exposure to chemicals through the analysis of wastewater daughton 2018 zuccato et al 2008 wbe has been successfully applied to estimate illicit drug consumption ort et al 2014b sodré et al 2018 thomas et al 2012 and lifestyle related factors such as alcohol reid et al 2011 and tobacco use zheng et al 2017 wbe can also provide information about the health diet and diseases associated with a community ahmed et al 2020a ahmed et al 2020c choi et al 2018a choi et al 2018b ryu et al 2016 wbe relies on the quantification of specific biomarkers in wastewater that ideally are 1 excreted through urine in consistent amounts with an adequate concentration once diluted in wastewater 2 sufficiently stable in wastewater during the transport process and 3 unique to human metabolism chen et al 2014 gracia lor et al 2017 mccall et al 2016 consumed analgesics can remain as the parent compound or transform into a metabolite through human metabolic pathways before excretion in urine into the sewer system sewer networks typically contain a mixture of gravity sewers pump stations rising mains and other structures wastewater contains soluble and particulate organics which can work as primary substrates for microbial growth on the sewerage infrastructure surface which is generally termed as biofilms romaní et al 2016 different wastewater characteristics or parameters e g dissolved oxygen nutrient ph temperature control the microbial growth and transformation of chemicals in the sewer network sharma et al 2013 gravity sewers are partially filled with wastewater where both aerobic and anaerobic microbes can exist whereas rising mains are filled with wastewater typically deprived of oxygen hence anaerobic microbes are largely predominant hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 several studies have already reported the in sewer stability of a limited number of opioids or nsaids in lab scale reactors and showed their applicability as a wbe biomarkers gao et al 2017 o brien et al 2017 ramin et al 2017 however there is a lack of information on the stability of different analgesic drugs particularly nsaids and this needs to be addressed to get accurate background information of their suitability as wbe biomarkers in this study we examined the stability of 19 nsaids and opioids biomarkers in the lab scale sewer reactors simulating real sewers this is to date the first in sewer stability assessment experiment of a broad range of analgesics and metabolites to evaluate their suitability as biomarkers for wbe minimal in sewer biomarker loss increases the confidence in wbe estimation of analgesics consumption by the population 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents nineteen analgesics and their metabolites were selected due to their common use as analgesics and potential for abuse these are diclofenac desmetramadol ibuprofen carboxylic

and multiquant 3 0 2 respectively 2 3 lab scale sewer reactors representative lab scale sewer reactors were used to assess the transformation of selected analgesics and their metabolites under realistic sewer conditions these lab scale sewer reactors comprised a rising main reactor rmr a gravity sewer reactor gsr and a control reactor cr li et al 2018 the diameter of rmr was 80 mm and was made of perspex with a volume of 0 75 l four stainless steel rods 1 cm diameter inside the reactor were used to facilitate the biofilm growth the gsr was partially filled with real wastewater with similar dimension of rmr the gsr had a mixture of biofilm aerobic and anaerobic rmr and gsr have been established and operating over years under anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively banks et al 2018 jiang et al 2009 mature biofilms were cultivated on the inner surfaces of the reactor walls with a calculated biofilm area to wastewater volume a v ratio of 72 5 m2 m3 in rmr and 50 m2 m3 in gsr biofilms in both the rmr and the gsr showed strong biological activities as indicated by their sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities see section 3 1 for results domestic sewage was used to feed the reactors and was pumped in with a peristaltic pump masterflex 7520 47 every 6 h a magnetic stirrer was used for continuous mixing 250 rpm inside each reactor to confirm homogeneous distribution typical sewage parameters are shown in the si section 1 due to regular cleaning and a lack of plastic carriers which facilitate biofilm growth the cr has no biofilm formation and contains wastewater only triplicate batch tests were conducted to estimate the transformation of the analgesic compounds and their biomarkers a chemical mix of target biomarkers 10 μg l were spiked into the reactors before spiking the target biomarkers wastewater was warmed to room temperature and then mixed rapidly before feeding to the drained reactors wastewater samples were collected at multiple time points during each 12 hrs batch test 0 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 and 12 hrs filtered and then stored at 80 c until further analysis before instrumental analysis samples were defrosted to room temperature and spiked with internal standards 10 µg l then immediately analysed by direct injection due to the high spiked levels direct injection analysis was sufficient 2 4 acceptable criteria to select the stability of compounds in this study we grouped the biomarkers in the following criteria to assess their stability in the sewer reactor a highly stable biomarkers 0 20 transformation within 12 h b moderately stable biomarkers 20 50 transformation within 12 h c unstable biomarkers 50 transformation within 12 h 2 5 quality assurance and quality control qa qc a nine point calibration curve was used 0 1 to

native spiked pooled wastewater sample and a method blank were analysed to confirm and monitor the instrument and analytical method performance the results of qa qc are listed in supplementary information si table s5 2 6 data processing at time 0 the concentration of chemicals was considered as the initial concentration 100 for each 12 h experiment all concentrations were normalised to a percentage relative to the initial concentration to evaluate the degradation profile under sewer conditions zero order or first order kinetics models were applied and the best fit kinetic model was identified based on the highest correlation r value half life in pseudo first order model was computed in pseudo first order model analyses were carried out using graphpad prism 9 graphpad software inc and matlab version 2020b 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological activities in the sewer reactors wastewater ph was stable during the batch tests rmr ph 7 06 0 1 gsr ph 7 13 0 1 and cr ph 7 50 0 2 biological activity as described by methane and sulfide production rates were monitored in the simulated rmr and gsr stronger activities of sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens were found in the rmr reactor the production of dissolved sulfide and methane was lower in the gsr reactors this is likely because of the presence of oxygen and the transfer of hydrogen sulfide and methane from the bulk wastewater phase to air in gsr limited biological activity was observed in cr in the absence of biofilms as indicated by the little consumption of sulfate or scod the results of the biological activities are comparable with previous studies table 1 gao et al 2017 thai et al 2014a thai et al 2014b 3 2 sewer reactor data analysis to assess biomarker stability under the different sewer conditions regression models zero or first order were fitted to the biomarker data to establish best fit table 2 we used the regression with the highest r2 value except the linear regression had a slope not significantly different from zero indicates the stability over the test period it indicated that relatively large deviation between the observed data and the fitted regression model could be attributed to the complexity of the reactors including the potential variations in biological activities and wastewater conditions 3 2 1 transformation of biomarkers in the control reactor in the cr reactor the transformation profile is best described by a zero order model all the studied biomarkers were highly stable in the cr table 3 fig 1 however ibuprofen carboxylic acid naloxone and ketoprofen showed slight formation behaviour in the cr low rates of transformation are expected in the cr as there is no biofilm present and microbial activity is likely to be low thai et al 2014a in a previous study with the same reactor o brien et al o brien et al 2019 outlined that the increased gas liquid transfer causing the higher dissolved oxygen do level in cr which may be responsible for the transformation of certain biomarkers in cr table 3 all the investigated biomarkers were highly stable for at least 12 h in the cr fig 1 3 2 2 transformation of biomarkers in gravity sewer reactor gsr in the gsr reactor the transformation profile was best described by a first order model except ibuprofen carboxylic acid lidocaine and tapentadol table 2 ibuprofen carboxylic acid lidocaine and tapentadol followed the stable transformation over the experimental time based on our stability criteria where 0 20 transformation over 12 h is considered highly stable and diclofenac desmetramadol ibuprofen carboxylic acid ketoprofen lidocaine and tapentadol in gsr meet these criteria table 3 and fig 1 valdecoxib parecoxib etoricoxib indomethacin naltrexone naloxone piroxicam ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol oxymorphone hydrocodone meperidine hydromorphone were transformed up to 20 50 in 12 h and classified as moderately stable biomarkers celecoxib and sulindac were considered unstable biomarkers in gsr with 50 transformation over 12 h table 3 and fig 1 3 2 3 transformation of biomarkers in the rising main reactor rmr lidocaine and tapentadol were stable over the 12 h experimental period ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol meperidine hydromorphone were transformed by 0 20 over the experimental period in rmr table 3 and fig 1 diclofenac desmetramadol ibuprofen carboxylic acid valdecoxib parecoxib etoricoxib indomethacin naltrexone piroxicam were transformed up to 20 50 in 12 h these biomarkers were considered moderately stable biomarkers in rmr sulindac celecoxib naloxone oxymorphone and hydrocodone were transformed more than 50 in 12 h and considered as unstable biomarkers in the rmr table 3 and fig 1 3 3 implication for wastewater based epidemiology the primary goal of wbe is to quantify community wide chemical consumption or exposure the method is subject to several uncertainties associated with different steps detailed understanding of biomarker stability under different sewer conditions can help improve the accuracy of final estimates and assist in interpretation in this study diclofenac desmetramadol ibuprofen carboxylic acid piroxicam ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol meperidine and hydromorphone were stable 20 transformation within 12 h considering all conditions and the type of sewers however the type of sewer reactor and hydraulic retention time hrt could play a crucial part in interpretation of our results it is noted that most wastewater catchments mainly comprise gravity sewer with the median in sewer residence time of approximately 4 h ort et al 2014a based on this study we could say only celecoxib and sulindac had 20 loss in 4 h before entering the network and passing the sampling location at the wwtp biofilms in both gsr and rmr increased the transformation of the biomarkers hence to estimate the analgesic consumption through wbe we need to also consider the associated uncertainties sewer infrastructures population characteristics etc further knowledge about the sorption and transformation behaviour of chemicals could help to develop a systematic model that can reduce the uncertainties in back estimating consumption using wbe 4 limitations there are several limitations that need to be acknowledged in this study in a real world scenario the surface area to volume ratio a v of rm and gs is different compared to lab scale sewer reactors gao et al 2017 it is also noted that for certain biomarkers the gs and rm sewer reactors may overestimate the degradation profile compared to pilot sewers functioning with gsr and rmr mode choi et al 2020 in this study we only measured the free and non conjugated forms of the analgesic analytes also there may be residual concentrations that transform to the biomarkers in the sewer reactors but at the levels it was spiked we believe this would have negligible impact as opioids typically have a relatively high log kow they may be prone to sorption to particulate matter and biofilms baker et al 2012 subedi and kannan 2014 5 conclusions this study examined the potential for a panel of analgesic biomarkers to be used for wbe the transformation of analgesics and their metabolites are sewer specific and depend on the proportion of gsr and rmr in the catchment area diclofenac desmetramadol ibuprofen carboxylic acid piroxicam ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol meperidine and hydromorphone in gsr and ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol meperidine and hydromorphone in rmr were shown to be stable biomarkers respectively in

mainly non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and opioids brower 2000 while analgesics act to relieve body pain misuse and overdose of analgesics and specifically opioids can pose a health burden and additional mortality to our communities berterame et al 2016 assessing the prevalence of pain in a community or population can be challenging individual pain assessment tools provide the scope to measure pain relland et al 2019 but are often limited to an individual or personal scale we recently proposed a new theoretical method through the wastewater based measurement of the population treated pain burden ahmed et al 2020b a theoretical basis for quantifying analgesic drugs in wastewater followed by normalisation of the relative drug potency to estimate community pain burden was presented ahmed et al 2020b the proposed method would allow us to estimate analgesics and rank the population treated pain burden area within and between populations wastewater based epidemiology wbe entails the systematic sampling and analysis of chemical markers in wastewater to estimate human consumption of or exposure to chemicals through the analysis of wastewater daughton 2018 zuccato et al 2008 wbe has been successfully applied to estimate illicit drug consumption ort et al 2014b sodré et al 2018 thomas et al 2012 and lifestyle related factors such as alcohol reid et al 2011 and tobacco use zheng et al 2017 wbe can also provide information about the health diet and diseases associated with a community ahmed et al 2020a ahmed et al 2020c choi et al 2018a choi et al 2018b ryu et al 2016 wbe relies on the quantification of specific biomarkers in wastewater that ideally are 1 excreted through urine in consistent amounts with an adequate concentration once diluted in wastewater 2 sufficiently stable in wastewater during the transport process and 3 unique to human metabolism chen et al 2014 gracia lor et al 2017 mccall et al 2016 consumed analgesics can remain as the parent compound or transform into a metabolite through human metabolic pathways before excretion in urine into the sewer system sewer networks typically contain a mixture of gravity sewers pump stations rising mains and other structures wastewater contains soluble and particulate organics which can work as primary substrates for microbial growth on the sewerage infrastructure surface which is generally termed as biofilms romaní et al 2016 different wastewater characteristics or parameters e g dissolved oxygen nutrient ph temperature control the microbial growth and transformation of chemicals in the sewer network sharma et al 2013 gravity sewers are partially filled with wastewater where both aerobic and anaerobic microbes can exist whereas rising mains are filled with wastewater typically deprived of oxygen hence anaerobic microbes are largely predominant hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 several studies have already reported the in sewer stability of a limited number of opioids or nsaids in lab scale reactors and showed their applicability as a wbe biomarkers gao et al 2017 o brien et al 2017 ramin et al 2017 however there is a lack of information on the stability of different analgesic drugs particularly nsaids and this needs to be addressed to get accurate background information of their suitability as wbe biomarkers in this study we examined the stability of 19 nsaids and opioids biomarkers in the lab scale sewer reactors simulating real sewers this is to date the first in sewer stability assessment experiment of a broad range of analgesics and metabolites to evaluate their suitability as biomarkers for wbe minimal in sewer biomarker loss increases the confidence in wbe estimation of analgesics consumption by the population 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents nineteen analgesics and their metabolites were selected due to their common use as analgesics and potential for abuse these are diclofenac desmetramadol ibuprofen carboxylic acid valdecoxib parecoxib celecoxib etoricoxib indomethacin sulindac naltrexone naloxone piroxicam ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol oxymorphone hydrocodone meperidine and hydromorphone detailed description of the biomarkers is shown in the si table s1 all reference standards and deuterated label internal standards is were supplied from novachem new south wales australia and pm separations

and multiquant 3 0 2 respectively 2 3 lab scale sewer reactors representative lab scale sewer reactors were used to assess the transformation of selected analgesics and their metabolites under realistic sewer conditions these lab scale sewer reactors comprised a rising main reactor rmr a gravity sewer reactor gsr and a control reactor cr li et al 2018 the diameter of rmr was 80 mm and was made of perspex with a volume of 0 75 l four stainless steel rods 1 cm diameter inside the reactor were used to facilitate the biofilm growth the gsr was partially filled with real wastewater with similar dimension of rmr the gsr had a mixture of biofilm aerobic and anaerobic rmr and gsr have been established and operating over years under anaerobic and aerobic conditions respectively banks et al 2018 jiang et al 2009 mature biofilms were cultivated on the inner surfaces of the reactor walls with a calculated biofilm area to wastewater volume a v ratio of 72 5 m2 m3 in rmr and 50 m2 m3 in gsr biofilms in both the rmr and the gsr showed strong biological activities as indicated by their sulfidogenic and methanogenic activities see section 3 1 for results domestic sewage was used to feed the reactors and was pumped in with a peristaltic pump masterflex 7520 47 every 6 h a magnetic stirrer was used for continuous mixing 250 rpm inside each reactor to confirm homogeneous distribution typical sewage parameters are shown in the si section 1 due to regular cleaning and a lack of plastic carriers which facilitate biofilm growth the cr has no biofilm formation and contains wastewater only triplicate batch tests were conducted to estimate the transformation of the analgesic compounds and their biomarkers a chemical mix of target biomarkers 10 μg l were spiked into the reactors before spiking the target biomarkers wastewater was warmed to room temperature and then mixed rapidly before feeding to the drained reactors wastewater samples were collected at multiple time points during each 12 hrs batch test 0 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 and 12 hrs filtered and then stored at 80 c until further analysis before instrumental analysis samples were defrosted to room temperature and spiked with internal standards 10 µg l then immediately analysed by direct injection due to the high spiked levels direct injection analysis was sufficient 2 4 acceptable criteria to select the stability of compounds in this study we grouped the biomarkers in the following criteria to assess their stability in the sewer reactor a highly stable biomarkers 0 20 transformation within 12 h b moderately stable biomarkers 20 50 transformation within 12 h c unstable biomarkers 50 transformation within 12 h 2 5 quality assurance and quality control qa qc a nine point calibration curve was used 0 1 to 100 μg l linearity r2 0 99 with isotopically labelled internal standards 10 μg l for quantification for every ten samples analysed a calibration point a duplicate sample a pooled wastewater sample a native spiked pooled wastewater sample and a method blank were analysed to confirm and monitor the instrument and analytical method performance the results of qa qc are listed in supplementary information si table s5 2 6 data processing at time 0 the concentration of chemicals was considered as the initial concentration 100 for each 12 h experiment all concentrations were normalised to a percentage relative to the initial concentration to evaluate the degradation profile under sewer conditions zero order or first order kinetics models were applied and the best fit kinetic model was identified based on the highest correlation r value half life in pseudo first order model was computed in pseudo first order model analyses were carried out using graphpad prism 9 graphpad software inc and matlab version 2020b 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological activities in the sewer reactors wastewater ph was stable during the batch tests rmr ph 7 06 0 1 gsr ph 7 13 0 1 and cr ph 7 50 0 2 biological activity as described by methane and sulfide production rates were monitored in the simulated rmr and gsr stronger activities of sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogens were found in the rmr reactor the production of dissolved sulfide and methane was lower in the gsr reactors this is likely because of the presence of oxygen and the transfer of hydrogen sulfide and methane from the bulk wastewater phase to air in gsr limited biological activity was observed in cr in the absence of biofilms as indicated by the little consumption of sulfate or scod the results of the biological activities are comparable with previous studies table 1 gao et al 2017 thai et al 2014a thai et al 2014b 3 2 sewer reactor data analysis to assess biomarker stability under the different sewer conditions regression models zero or first order were fitted to the biomarker data to establish best fit table 2 we used the regression with the highest r2 value except the linear regression had a slope not significantly different from zero indicates the stability over the test period it indicated that relatively large deviation between the observed data and the fitted regression model could be attributed to the complexity of the reactors including the potential variations in biological activities and wastewater conditions 3 2 1 transformation of biomarkers in the control reactor in the cr reactor the transformation profile is best described by a zero order model all the studied biomarkers were highly stable in the cr table 3 fig 1 however ibuprofen carboxylic acid naloxone and ketoprofen showed slight formation behaviour in the cr low rates of transformation are expected in the cr as there is no biofilm present and microbial activity is likely to be low thai et al 2014a in a previous study with the same reactor o brien et al o brien et al 2019 outlined that the increased gas liquid transfer causing the higher dissolved oxygen do level in cr which may be responsible for the transformation of certain biomarkers in cr table 3 all the investigated biomarkers were highly stable for at least 12 h in the cr fig 1 3 2 2 transformation of biomarkers in gravity sewer reactor gsr in the gsr reactor the transformation profile was best described by a first order model except ibuprofen carboxylic acid lidocaine and tapentadol table 2 ibuprofen carboxylic acid lidocaine and tapentadol followed the stable transformation over the experimental time based on our stability criteria where 0 20 transformation over 12 h is considered highly stable and diclofenac desmetramadol ibuprofen carboxylic acid ketoprofen lidocaine and tapentadol in gsr meet these criteria table 3 and fig 1 valdecoxib parecoxib etoricoxib indomethacin naltrexone naloxone piroxicam ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol oxymorphone hydrocodone meperidine hydromorphone were transformed up to 20 50 in 12 h and classified as moderately stable biomarkers celecoxib and sulindac were considered unstable biomarkers in gsr with 50 transformation over 12 h table 3 and fig 1 3 2 3 transformation of biomarkers in the rising main reactor rmr lidocaine and tapentadol were stable over the 12 h experimental period ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol meperidine hydromorphone were transformed by 0 20 over the experimental period in rmr table 3 and fig 1 diclofenac desmetramadol ibuprofen carboxylic acid valdecoxib parecoxib etoricoxib indomethacin naltrexone piroxicam were transformed up to 20 50 in 12 h these biomarkers were considered moderately stable biomarkers in rmr sulindac celecoxib naloxone oxymorphone and hydrocodone were transformed more than 50 in 12 h and considered as unstable biomarkers in the rmr table 3 and fig 1 3 3 implication for wastewater based epidemiology the primary goal of wbe is to quantify community wide chemical consumption or exposure the method is subject to several uncertainties associated with different steps detailed understanding of biomarker stability under different sewer conditions can help improve the accuracy of final estimates and assist in interpretation in this study diclofenac desmetramadol ibuprofen carboxylic acid piroxicam ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol meperidine and hydromorphone were stable 20 transformation within 12 h considering all conditions and the type of sewers however the type of sewer reactor and hydraulic retention time hrt could play a crucial part in interpretation of our results it is noted that most wastewater catchments mainly comprise gravity sewer with the median in sewer residence time of approximately 4 h ort et al 2014a based on this study we could say only celecoxib and sulindac had 20 loss in 4 h before entering the network and passing the sampling location at the wwtp biofilms in both gsr and rmr increased the transformation of the biomarkers hence to estimate the analgesic consumption through wbe we need to also consider the associated uncertainties sewer infrastructures population characteristics etc further knowledge about the sorption and transformation behaviour of chemicals could help to develop a systematic model that can reduce the uncertainties in back estimating consumption using wbe 4 limitations there are several limitations that need to be acknowledged in this study in a real world scenario the surface area to volume ratio a v of rm and gs is different compared to lab scale sewer reactors gao et al 2017 it is also noted that for certain biomarkers the gs and rm sewer reactors may overestimate the degradation profile compared to pilot sewers functioning with gsr and rmr mode choi et al 2020 in this study we only measured the free and non conjugated forms of the analgesic analytes also there may be residual concentrations that transform to the biomarkers in the sewer reactors but at the levels it was spiked we believe this would have negligible impact as opioids typically have a relatively high log kow they may be prone to sorption to particulate matter and biofilms baker et al 2012 subedi and kannan 2014 5 conclusions this study examined the potential for a panel of analgesic biomarkers to be used for wbe the transformation of analgesics and their metabolites are sewer specific and depend on the proportion of gsr and rmr in the catchment area diclofenac desmetramadol ibuprofen carboxylic acid piroxicam ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol meperidine and hydromorphone in gsr and ketoprofen lidocaine tapentadol meperidine and hydromorphone in rmr were shown to be stable biomarkers respectively in the future a comprehensive in sewer study including mathematical modelling could help to reduce the uncertainties in overall estimation declaration of competing interest the authors have no conflict
