10885,scarcity of irrigation water has now become the main constraint for crop production globally irrigation water scarcity becomes severe especially during the dry winter season in south asia particularly in bangladesh due to the decline in groundwater table and drying of surface water resources in south asian countries potato is traditionally grown with furrow irrigation system in dry winter season in which irrigation water is applied frequently to each and every furrow such irrigation method increases water use and lowers irrigation water productivity wp we hypothesized that potatoes grown on raised beds and irrigation water applied to alternate furrows based on the principle of partial root zone drying would maintain yield reduce water use and increase wp and enhance the quality of potato tubers in drought prone areas of south asia to test this hypothesis an experiment was conducted in two consecutive dry winter seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 at the research field of irrigation and water management division of the bangladesh agricultural research institute gazipur central bangladesh and assessed crop dry matter and yields water use and wp quality and nutrient concentrations of potato tubers in different irrigation treatments the experiment consisted of two levels first three irrigation at critical growth stages and second four irrigation at every 12 15 days interval and three methods afi alternate furrow irrigation ffi fixed furrow irrigation and efi every furrow irrigation of irrigation dry matter and tuber yield of potato did not differ significantly p 0 05 between afi and efi but differed significantly p 0 01 when compared to ffi on average afi and efi had tuber yield of 21 9 and 22 2 t ha 1 with three irrigation and 23 2 t ha 1 and 23 9 t ha 1 with four irrigation respectively during 2016 and 2017 while afi and efi had wp of 14 8 kg m 3 and 9 89 kg m 3 with three irrigation and 14 9 kg m 3 and 9 96 kg m 3 with four irrigation respectively during 2016 and 2017 on average afi saved irrigation water by 35 and irrigation water productivity significantly p 0 001 improved by 50 compared to efi over two years total soluble sugar as an indicator of tuber quality also varied significantly p 0 01 between afi 6 290 brix and efi 6 370 brix nutrient concentrations of potato tubers were not significantly different p 0 05 between irrigation treatments results demonstrate that the alternate furrow irrigation can maintain potato tuber yield and reduce water use and increase irrigation water productivity of potato tubers compared to every or fixed furrow irrigation in bangladesh this irrigation method could potentially be an attractive alternative to every or fixed furrow irrigation in south asian countries where irrigation

production during the dry rabi winter season in south asia murad et al 2018 islam et al 2019 irrigation water management especially in the winter season is now a challenging issue in targeting resource constrained farmers with limited access to irrigation in areas of water scarcity of bangladesh a heavily populated country in south asia potato being an important crop both cultivated area and total production of potato have increased recently in bangladesh due to its high demand saha et al 2015 now bangladesh is the seventh largest potato producer over 10 million tons in the world and third biggest in asia in 2017 in bangladesh potato is primarily consumed as a vegetable whereas it is a staple food crop in many countries khandker and basak 2018 www potatopro com in other countries of south asia also the potato cropping area has been expanding rapidly bardhan roy et al 1999 devaux et al 2014 in many potato cropping areas in the world global warming has negatively affected potato tuber yield thiele et al 2010 hijmans 2003 predicted that about 18 32 of potato yield would be reduced globally from 2010 to 2039 due to climate change effects increasing water use efficiency or water productivity wue wp in potato tuber yield per amount of water applied is becoming an important issue worldwide deficit irrigation irrigated water below the maximum crop evapotranspiration and partial root zone drying alternated irrigation of the root zone by watering in one furrow and keeping dry the adjacent furrow until the next watering cycle are reported as the promising irrigation techniques to save water with a concomitant increase in wue or wp without significant tuber yield reduction jovanovic et al 2010 jensen et al 2010 xie et al 2012 several studies have shown that partial root drying technique can save water by 39 50 than a deficit or full irrigation yactayo et al 2013 xu et al 2011 obtained higher tuber yield with partial root drying when water restriction was initiated soon after tuber initiation both in the pot and in field trials traditionally irrigating to each and every furrow is one of the oldest techniques of surface irrigation this technique still remains a common method for irrigation of row crops across the world koech et al 2014 including south asia and in particular in bangladesh the traditional surface furrow irrigation method however uses a high amount of water and hence needs improvement to raise its water use efficiency sharma and minhas 2005 jat et al 2011 sarker et al 2016 on the other hand drip irrigation has been found to be one of the most efficient irrigation methods globally especially in the areas with limited and expensive water supplies hezarjaribi et al 2008 however considering the economic condition of farmers in bangladesh and across south asia the drip irrigation system is expensive due to its high initial investments and will hardly be affordable by the small and medium farmers raised bed furrows which are the improved and efficient versions of surface flat furrows are small channels which can easily be made parallel to carry irrigation water and to provide a favorable environment for crop growth yactayo et al 2013 the raised bed alternate furrow irrigation technique is established based on partial root zone drying in soil that creates the root to shoot chemical signal this process results in stomatal closure for reducing water loss a small narrowing of the stomata opening may reduce water and nutrient loss without any significant effect on photosynthesis davies and zhang 1991 in the alternate furrow irrigation water is normally applied approximately to half of the root system while the remaining half is dried stikic et al 2003 the alternate wetting and drying sides of the root system are alternated in a frequency according to crop growth stages and soil water balance yactayo et al 2013 the understanding of this process is essential for the successful application of the alternate wetting and drying technique alternate partial root zone irrigation may substantially reduce water loss but would have little effect on the rate of photosynthesis partial root zone drying irrigation prdi including alternate prdi and fixed prdi are new water saving irrigation techniques and could improve the wue or wp of potato without significant yield reduction kang and zhang 2004 there are many studies about the effects of prdi on crop physiology growth nutrient uptake and wue yactayo et al 2013 hu et al 2009 li et al 2007 nutrient and water requirements are closely related fertilizer application is likely to increase the efficiency of crops in utilizing available water farooq et al 2009 transpiration is inhibited by drought but this may not necessarily affect nutrient uptake in a similar manner currently it is evident that crop yield can be substantially improved by enhancing the plant nutrient efficiency under limited moisture supply fageria et al 2008 the heterogeneous soil moisture distribution may affect soil enzymatic activities and crop water use organic n plays a major role in enhancing canopy wue and soil enzymatic activities fertilization too can affect soil enzymatic activities li et al 2010 indeed prdi creates an uneven distribution of soil moisture that may affect many processes including many soil enzymatic activities wang et al 2008 in the current changing climate scenario the major challenge for the south asia researchers is to develop an alternate system or method of irrigation water application which is energy water and labor efficient and can produce more with less cost or less water many studies have shown that furrow irrigation can reduce irrigation water and substantially improve the wue ebrahimian and playan 2014 koech et al 2014 reddi and reddy 2009 jat et al 2005 growing potatoes with alternate furrow irrigation afi in raised beds technique could be attractive to bangladeshi and south asia farmers due to its requirements for comparatively low initial capital and on going maintenance costs and low energy and its easiness in use by unskilled labor however afi has not yet been investigated for potato cultivation in bangladesh and large parts of south asia we hypothesize that afi would maintain yield reduce water use and increase the irrigation wp for potato cultivation in drought prone areas of bangladesh where water resources are scarce in response to this research gap we compared the potato grown under raised beds with afi together with every furrow irrigation efi and fixed furrow irrigation ffi each with two levels of irrigation and assessed the dry matter production tuber yield water productivity and n p k zn b and total soluble solids tss contents in potato tubers in the tropical central bangladesh

gazipur latitude and longitude of 23 59 19 40 n and 90 24 33 02 e respectively during the dry season november february in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 the soil was silt clay loam with an average gravimetric field capacity fc of 28 weight basis and mean bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3over 0 60 cm soil profile the initial soil chemical properties of the experimental field at the 0 30 cm soil depth with 10 cm increment is shown in table 1 two years of weather data recorded during the crop growth period differed in the distribution of rainfall maximum temperature and sunshine hours especially in the second year sunshine hours and maximum temperature were higher than in the first year fig 1 2 2 experimental design and treatment the experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design rcbd with six treatments replicated thrice the treatments consisted of six combinations of two irrigation levels and three furrow irrigation methods two irrigation levels were i irrigation at stolonization stage 20 25 days after planting dap tuber formation stage 40 45 dap and tuber enlargement stage 60 65 dap i1 ii irrigation at every 12 15 days interval i2 three irrigation methods were i alternate furrow irrigation afi ii fixed furrow irrigation ffi iii every furrow irrigation efi in afi irrigation was applied to alternate furrows while the in between furrow keeps dry fig 2 b a in subsequent irrigation water is applied to the alternate furrows that had been kept dry on the previous occasion in efi it was applied to each furrow fig 2b c while in ffi it was applied to the fixed furrow keeps wet and the neighboring furrow keeps dry from first irrigation to last irrigation fig 2b b at each irrigation event water was applied up to 100 of field capacity estimated at weight basis the unit plot size was 27 square meter 5 4 m 5 m 2 3 crop management a potato variety bari alu 28 cv ladi rossetta suitable for making chips was used in this study potatoes were planted on 23 november in 2015 and on 22 november in 2016 with the row to row ridge top center to ridge top center distance of 60 cm and plant to plant spacing of 25 cm potato tubers were planted manually by hand at the time of plant establishment the same amount of irrigation water was applied in every furrow in all treatments and the irrigation treatments were initiated after plant establishment the recommended doses of fertilizers were nitrogen n at 120 phosphorus p at 30 potassium k at 100 sulfur s at 15 zinc zn at 4 and boron b at 1 4 kg ha 1 and applied in the form of urea triple super phosphate muriate of potash gypsum zinc sulfate and borax respectively frg 2012 decomposed cowdung was applied 5 t ha 1 before land preparation half of n and k and all p s zn b and cowdung were applied as basal below the soil surface as horizontal and vertical separation of tubers during planting fig 2a remaining n and k were applied as side dressing at 22 27 days after planting dap during earthing up operation followed by irrigation adequate plant protection measures were taken whenever required 2 4 soil moisture content irrigation water application and water use gravimetric soil moisture content was determined before each irrigation event the soils were sampled from both the center of the raised beds and bottom of the furrows from 0 150 150 300 and 300 450 mm soil depths at the time of planting to harvest the soil samples were taken from each plot in 150 mm depth increment from the soil surface well mixed together subsampled weighed dried at 105 c for 72 h and reweighed and gravimetric moisture content determined the irrigation water requirement was calculated by the following formula michael 1978 majumdar 2004 sarker et al 2016 1 i n i n p w i 100 b a i d i pw fc rl where i is depth of irrigation water to be applied within one irrigation cycle mm bai is apparent specific gravity of the ith layer of the soil di is depth of the ith layer of the soil profile within the root

number of soil layers in the root zone depth the root zone depth was considered 450 mm with 150 mm depth increment from the soil surface the calculated amount of irrigation water was measured by volumetric method and supplied to the experimental plot using a polyethene hose pipe connected to a water flow meter seasonal crop water use scwu was estimated by the following eq 2 using the soil water balance approach michael 1978 onder et al 2005 ierna and mauromicale 2018 2 s c w u i p e c r d p r s δ s w c where i is irrigation water applied mm and pe is effective rainfall mm estimated by using the usda soil conservation method smith 1992 cr is capillary rise mm dp is deep percolation mm and rs is surface runoff in this study there was no drainage during each irrigation event because irrigation water was based on soil water content and applied to field capacity only each treatment plot was separated by 1 5 m to prevent the lateral movement of water from one plot to another and hence there was no surface runoff hence parameters were considered negligible and hence were not taken into account during calculation δ swc is the change in soil water contribution before planting and final harvest and followed the eq 3 michael 1978 3 δ s w c n i n m c p i m c h i 100 b a i d i where mcpi is soil water content before planting and mch i is soil water content at the final harvest

plants were randomly collected from each treatment at 22 41 63 and 85 dap during 2015 2016 and 27 42 64 and 76 dap during 2016 2017 the roots and tubers were collected and cleaned and washed with clean water the dry matter of roots stems leaves and tubers were dried in the oven at 600 c until a constant weight was reached and expressed in g m 2 2 6 yield and water productivity two rows from each treatment were randomly chosen to measure the number of tubers per plant the number of tubers plant and marketable tuber yield t ha 1 were measured from the fresh weight from the plants harvested from the selected two rows of each plot the potato was manually harvested on february 17 in both years field water productivity wp was calculated as the ratio of economic tuber yield t ha 1 and scwu

yield and yield attributes and water productivity were statistically analyzed to test the effects of irrigation levels and methods on these parameters using r statistical software version 3 1 2 2014 developed by the r foundation for statistical computing platform r core team 2014 all the treatment means were subjected to analysis of variance anova and analyzed following randomized complete block design rcbd and compared for any significant differences using r statistical models at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 dry matter content the total dry matter tdm and dry matter partitioning of the potato plants as influenced by treatments at different growth stages over two years are presented in figs 3 5 there was a significant effect of the year fig 3 a on tdm and dry matter partitioning to root leaf and tuber of potato plants fig 4 there was a significant effect p 0 001 of the year fig 3a and treatment fig 3b on the tdm as well as dry matter partitioning to root stem leaf and tubers figs 4 and 5 at different growth stages the mean values over two years 2016 and 2017 indicate that tdm of the potato plants was significantly different p 0 001 among the treatments whereas the treatments afi and efi had no significant difference at the later growth stage i e 76 85 dap fig 3b the results also indicate that the year and treatment effects had no significant differences at the harvesting stage tdm was significantly lower in ffi than afi and efi when the number of irrigation events and the amount of applied water were reduced at different growth stages of potato plants at 22 27 dap tdr was insignificantly lower by around 5 in afi and significantly p 0 001 lower by around 14 in ffi compared to traditional efi at 41 42 dap the effect of the year had significant p 0 05 difference on tdm fig 3a but root stem and tuber had no significant differences figs 4 and 5 on the other hand the irrigation level method had highly significant p 0 001 at 41 42 dap fig 3b similarly the interactive effect of year and treatment had a significant difference in tdm at tuber development stage 63 64 dap the year had no significant difference on tdr fig 3a but the effect of treatment fig 3b and interactive effect of year and treatment had a significant difference on tdr and its partitioning to root leaf and tuber the results also indicated that the dry matter partitioning differed significantly among the methods figs 4 and 5 at the later growth stages the greater amount of dry matter was partitioned to tubers compared to that in the initial stage figs 4 and 5 thus ffi also significantly p 0 001 affected the tdm and its partitioning at different growth stages of potato plants 3 2 tuber numbers and tuber yield the analysis of variance anova and the mean values of tuber yield of potato is presented in table 2 there was no significant year effect but a significant effect was recorded on tuber yield and tuber number of potato fresh potato tuber yields were significantly different among the treatments although there were no significant differences between afi 22 3 t ha 1 and efi 23 1 t ha 1 with three irrigations and between afi 23 9 t ha 1 and efi 24 6 t ha 1 with four irrigations during 2016 table 2 similar trends were observed during 2017 though total tuber yield in this year was slightly lower compared to that in 2016 when irrigated either three or four times in 2017 fresh tuber weight m2 and tuber yield varied significantly among the treatments but not between afi 21 52 t ha 1 and efi 21 49 t ha 1 with three irrigations and between afi 22 60 t ha 1 and efi 23 17 t ha 1 with four irrigations table 2 tuber numbers per plant and tuber weight m2 were not significantly different between afi and efi but were greater than that of ffi in both years in the combined analysis treatment means of yield contributing characters of potato plants insignificantly influenced between afi and efi when irrigated with i1 and i2 table 2 on an average the total tuber yield produced almost similar in afi by 21 89 and 22 22 t ha 1and efi by 23 26 and 23 92 t ha 1 when irrigated with i1 and i2 over two the two growing seasons in general the tuber yield in ffi was significantly lower than afi and efi on an average afi produced 2 1 lower tuber yield than efi table 2 although afi saved 35 irrigation water than efi method table 3 this result indicates that irrigation levels and methods had a significant effect on tuber production the average tuber yield was related to the amount of water supply and distribution method 3 3 effect of irrigation levels and methods on water saving and water productivity water productivity wp was estimated to describe the relationship between the tuber yield and the amount of water consumed seasonal crop water use scwu and wp varied among the treatments due to the variation of irrigation water applied afi saved irrigation water by 34 7 35 4 and 35 37 9 compared to efi when irrigation was applied at three critical stages and four irrigation at evey 12 15 days interval table 3 wp of afi significantly p 0 001 increased as compared to those of efi and ffi table 3 the highest wp was 15 13 and 15 32 kg m 3 for afi followed by 10 24 kg m 3 and 10 26 kg m 3 for efi and 13 0 and 12 99 kg m 3 for ffi with three and four irrigation respectively during 2016 in 2017 also wp of afi increased substantially as compared to efi and ffi table 3 the highest wp was 14 64 and 14 48 kg m 3 for afi followed by 9 55 and 9 66 kg m 3 for efi with three and four irrigation on average the highest wp was with afi 14 89 kg m 3 and the lowest with efi 9 9 kg m 3 afi improved wp significantly p 0 001 by 47 7 53 2 and 49 3 49 9 each compared to efi with three and four irrigation respectively table 3 the results indicate that afi produced the highest water saving and wp as compared to efi and ffi table 3 on average the afi saved around 35 seasonal irrigation water than efi on the other hand wp was significantly p 0 001 increased in afi by around 50 compared to efi efi system noticeably resulted in the lowest wp but this technique also did not produce significantly higher tuber yield with three or four irrigations 3 4 effect of irrigation levels and methods on n p k zn b and tss content of potato tuber the anova showed that there was no significant effect of year on the concentration of n k and b in potato tubers but had a significant effect on p zn and tss all p 0 05 table 4 the concentrations of n k zn and b had also insignificant differences among the treatments but the concentration of p and tss had significant p 0 05 differences the interactive effect of year and treatment had also no significant differences except tss and p table 4 except for zn and p concentrations n k b and tss concentrations in potato tubers were also had non significant variations among afi ffi and efi table 4 zn and b uptake in efi and afi had no significant differences but uptake was slightly higher in efi compared to afi with the increased number of irrigation events the concentrations of nutrients between afi and efi had no significant differences when the potato was irrigated with three or four times in both years these results indicate that efi did not notably increase the contents of n p k b and zn in potato tubers with three and four irrigations and also did not decrease the contents in tubers with deficit water supply during the crop growth period the content of tss of the potato tuber was also not significantly different between afi and efi table 4 4 discussion potato has been playing an important role in the food security of bangladesh as well as in south asia productivity and quality of potato tubers largely depend on the precise use of irrigation water the amount of water applied and its timing and method of water application are vital for better growth of the potato plant and tuber yield ati et al 2012 as the availability of irrigation water is becoming scarce and expensive worldwide it is important to find out the alternative ways of irrigation for meeting crop water requirement and high tuber yield despite the scarcity of irrigation water it is possible to increase the potato productivity by adopting the modern irrigation techniques or methods during the growing season ati et al 2012 kashyap and panda 2003 panigrahi et al 2001 consequently the adoption of water saving irrigation techniques such as the drip or sprinkler methods are increasingly being used in areas where irrigation water is limited these techniques are well proved in many countries to increase the yield and water productivity of different crops kang et al 2004 kumar et al 2009 ati et al 2012 however in bangladesh and large parts of south asia these techniques have not been used in large scale as these need higher initial investments and technical knowledge which most small to medium scale farmers may not be able to afford or acquire such farmers need simple easy to operate but efficient and low cost technology such as alternate furrow irrigation afi or every furrow irrigation efi which can use drastically less amount of water the idea of afi has been introduced from partial root zone drying technique which significantly improves water use efficiency wue without significant reduction in crop yield and quality majumdar 2004 reddi and reddy 2009 sarker et al 2016 in this study we examined the afi water saving technique and compared it with efi and ffi with two levels of irrigation to each technique on tuber yield tuber quality and wp of potato at field conditions fig 2 the results of this study indicate that among the three furrow irrigation techniques afi and efi produced significantly higher dry matter yield of potato compared to the ffi technique these results are in agreement with the findings of saha et al 2015 the results also indicate that the afi technique maintained desired yield when irrigation was applied in alternate furrows and kept the previously irrigated furrows dried earlier findings indicate that the wp of potatoes varied from 9 to 25 kg m 3 in different climates jovanovic et al 2010 ahmadi et al 2010 li et al 2007 islam et al 1990 reported that irrigation at 40 depletion of available soil moisture produced maximum potato yield 22 3 t ha and wue 8 1 kg m 3 in this study the wp of potato tubers varied from 9 5 to 15 3 kg m 3 and tuber yield varied from 19 5 to 24 5 t ha 1 table 3 which are consistent with the above studies our results are also inconsistent to many other studies who have reported that wp of potato tubers is substantially improved under deficit irrigation technique compared with full irrigation ierna and mauromicale 2018 badr et al 2012 darwish et al 2006 yuan et al 2003 mean values of over two years of this study indicated that afi saved irrigation water by 35 and significantly improved wp by 50 compared to traditional efi method of irrigation alternate drying irrigation technique has proved that it is an effective water saving irrigation method not only for potato cultivation but also for other crops such as maize kang and zhang 2004 and tomato sarker et al 2016 the afi efficiently utilizes soil moisture and improves soil enzymatic activities li et al 2010 sarker et al 2016 found that the alternate wetting and drying furrow irrigation technique saved irrigation water by 35 38 and improved wp by upto 40 compared to traditional efi for tomato cultivation ierna et al 2018 and hatfield et al 2001 suggested that wp could be increased from 25 to 40 through better agronomic practices which involve improved soil tillage nutrient and water management practices in most cases partial root drying technique has shown a great potential to increase wue and to maintain yield davies and hartung 2004 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 on the other hand the tuber yield of potatoes was decreased in the partial root drying irrigation liu et al 2005 in our study the potato tuber yield was insignificantly decreased in the afi compared to traditional efi table 2 this might be due to the earlier soil drying and mild water stress effect on early growth for tuber initiation liu et al 2005 2006 the tuber yields and wp of potato were significantly reduced in ffi than afi and efi due to the effect of water stress on the growth of potato plant for fixed drying of soil during the growing period table 2 a successful afi management depends on crops and cultivars growing periods evaporative demands soil texture and soil water balance the results indicate that irrigation level is also important and has significantly influenced on crop growth and yield in other studies the irrigation method had no significant effects on growth and tuber yields of potato but the irrigation levels significantly affected the tuber yield and yield contributing characters of potato e g onder et al 2005 tuber yield reduction could be avoided by controlling soil water as well as reducing n in this study basal fertilizers were placed below the soil surface as the lateral separation between potato seed and fertilizer fig 2 which could reduce the losses of soil nutrients nutrient and water have close relationships so that sub surface fertilizer application increases the crop nutrient efficiency in utilizing available water farooq et al 2009 the drought sensitive crops such as potato generally close their stomata when subjected to water stress ahmadi et al 2010 transpiration may be inhibited by alternate drying but this may not necessarily affect nutrient uptake in a similar way the technique of partial root drying increased the above ground plant dry matter and tuber fresh weight compared to full irrigation due to the maintenance of the optimal range of soil water content shahnazari et al 2007 the results reveal that total dry matter was significantly reduced in ffi than efi but increased with these techniques when irrigation level was increased figs 3 and 4 it indicates that the increase in water supply and fertilization led to greater total dry matter production in all growth stages of potato ierna and mauromicale 2018 camargo et al 2015 the results also reveal that afi technique has a positive influence on total dry matter figs 3a and 4 production and its partitioning figs 3b and 5 due to reduced transpiration loss by slightly limiting stomata opening of the potato plant many studies indicate that the plant roots in drying soil produce a root hormonal signal to the shoot that may restrict the transpiration through stomata off on but continue allowing photosynthesis and growth and resulting in higher wue davies and zhang 1991 zhang and davies 1989 therefore it is evident that yields could be improved by enhancing the plant nutrient efficiency under controlled irrigation water supply several studies also demonstrated that afi may improve product quality of potato plants zegbe et al 2004 shahnazari et al 2007 we noticed that the potato plants with afi showed green looking in all growth stages which might have contributed to the higher marketable tuber yields in afi shahnazari et al 2008 the possible reason could be that applying sub surface fertilizers increased soil available p content during the entire growing season and restricted the phosphatase from roots and thus could have maintained the energy level under stress conditions richardson et al 2011 alternate drying technique extends the root system to deeper layers and incites the initiation of secondary roots which can take up both water and nutrients from the soil and stimulate the growth of the plant kolbe and stephan beckmann 1997 hu et al 2009 liu et al 2005 the afi technique increases n uptake and reduces no3 leaching when irrigation water is alternately allowed to the wetted and dried sides of the root system during the growth stages of the crop skinner et al 1999 our study revealed that the water saving technique of afi did not significantly decrease the concentration of the nutrients of potato tubers compared to traditional efi table 4 these results indicate that afi and efi notably increased tss when irrigated with either three or four irrigations several studies also demonstrated that afi can improve product quality of potato plants zegbe et al 2004 shahnazari et al 2007 nutrient losses could be reduced by reducing water application during the tuber initiation and lengthening of the potato growth period han and kang 2002 reported that total n and p use efficiency was increased with the partial root drying technique compared to the traditional full irrigation prolonged soil drying may reduce the succulent roots for water conduction to main roots li et al 2007 from the results of the fixed furrow and traditional furrow irrigation indicates that prolonged wetting and drying also may affect the quality and tuber yield of potato during the growing period alternately wetting the soil may encourage the initiation and growth of secondary roots and therefore recover the roots sensitivity to soil drying in addition alternate drying and wetting root system in soil may perform better use of soil nutrients in the whole root zone area many studies have demonstrated that partial root drying technique has the potentiality to improve the grain fruit and vegetable yields and their quality zegbe et al 2006 leib et al 2006 shahnazari et al 2007 our study showed that though the potato tuber yields with the afi and efi techniques with three or four irrigations were not significantly different afi performed better in terms of reducing water use and increasing wp than efi both afi and efi were superior to ffi in terms of tuber yield and wp parameters results also showed that the afi water saving technique imposed up to maturity can maintain tuber yields as that of efi but can significantly reduce water use and increase wp of potato from the results of this study and the above discussion it can be inferred that the afi has the potential to improve the wp of potato without significant yield loss therefore it can be recommended as a useful irrigation water application method for potato crops grown in raised beds with furrows in the areas where irrigation water and water supplies are limited for sustainable potato production 5 conclusions the alternate furrow irrigation technique is a challenge to apply in field conditions for crop production without significant yield loss in this study we found that total dry matter yield of potato was not significantly different between alternate and every furrow irrigation techniques fresh yields of potato tubers were not statistically different between these techniques with three and four irrigations although every furrow irrigation produced slightly higher tuber yield than alternate furrow irrigation on average alternate furrow irrigation however saved 35 water and resulted in 50 higher water productivity compared to every furrow irrigation the n p k zn and b concentrations in potato tubers at harvest were similar for three methods of irrigation total soluble solids were nearly similar for alternate furrow and every furrow irrigation the alternate furrow irrigation technique has the potential for application in a dry environment with limited water this technique may be practiced by alternately irrigating one part of the root zone of the potato plant each time and may substantially improve the water productivity of potato without significant yield reduction due to the scarcity of irrigation water at present conditions demonstrations are necessary to identify the role of alternate furrow irrigation technique for optimum plant growth and yield of potato and other raised bed row crops which can be adapted easily to the areas where water is limited and the water savings goals can be achieved further studies are required to understand the alternate furrow irrigation technique with various soil types and raised beds for improving the water productivity and tuber quality without drastically reducing the tuber yield in south asia acknowledgements the study was based on the core funded research programme of the irrigation and water management iwm research division of the bangladesh agricultural research institute bari ministry of agriculture moa bangladesh the authors would like to acknowledge the iwm division under bari gazipur for providing all facilities and sharing knowledge for sustaining irrigated agriculture in the areas where available water is limited to irrigation in bangladesh 
10885,scarcity of irrigation water has now become the main constraint for crop production globally irrigation water scarcity becomes severe especially during the dry winter season in south asia particularly in bangladesh due to the decline in groundwater table and drying of surface water resources in south asian countries potato is traditionally grown with furrow irrigation system in dry winter season in which irrigation water is applied frequently to each and every furrow such irrigation method increases water use and lowers irrigation water productivity wp we hypothesized that potatoes grown on raised beds and irrigation water applied to alternate furrows based on the principle of partial root zone drying would maintain yield reduce water use and increase wp and enhance the quality of potato tubers in drought prone areas of south asia to test this hypothesis an experiment was conducted in two consecutive dry winter seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 at the research field of irrigation and water management division of the bangladesh agricultural research institute gazipur central bangladesh and assessed crop dry matter and yields water use and wp quality and nutrient concentrations of potato tubers in different irrigation treatments the experiment consisted of two levels first three irrigation at critical growth stages and second four irrigation at every 12 15 days interval and three methods afi alternate furrow irrigation ffi fixed furrow irrigation and efi every furrow irrigation of irrigation dry matter and tuber yield of potato did not differ significantly p 0 05 between afi and efi but differed significantly p 0 01 when compared to ffi on average afi and efi had tuber yield of 21 9 and 22 2 t ha 1 with three irrigation and 23 2 t ha 1 and 23 9 t ha 1 with four irrigation respectively during 2016 and 2017 while afi and efi had wp of 14 8 kg m 3 and 9 89 kg m 3 with three irrigation and 14 9 kg m 3 and 9 96 kg m 3 with four irrigation respectively during 2016 and 2017 on average afi saved irrigation water by 35 and irrigation water productivity significantly p 0 001 improved by 50 compared to efi over two years total soluble sugar as an indicator of tuber quality also varied significantly p 0 01 between afi 6 290 brix and efi 6 370 brix nutrient concentrations of potato tubers were not significantly different p 0 05 between irrigation treatments results demonstrate that the alternate furrow irrigation can maintain potato tuber yield and reduce water use and increase irrigation water productivity of potato tubers compared to every or fixed furrow irrigation in bangladesh this irrigation method could potentially be an attractive alternative to every or fixed furrow irrigation in south asian countries where irrigation

and total production of potato have increased recently in bangladesh due to its high demand saha et al 2015 now bangladesh is the seventh largest potato producer over 10 million tons in the world and third biggest in asia in 2017 in bangladesh potato is primarily consumed as a vegetable whereas it is a staple food crop in many countries khandker and basak 2018 www potatopro com in other countries of south asia also the potato cropping area has been expanding rapidly bardhan roy et al 1999 devaux et al 2014 in many potato cropping areas in the world global warming has negatively affected potato tuber yield thiele et al 2010 hijmans 2003 predicted that about 18 32 of potato yield would be reduced globally from 2010 to 2039 due to climate change effects increasing water use efficiency or water productivity wue wp in potato tuber yield per amount of water applied is becoming an important issue worldwide deficit irrigation irrigated water below the maximum crop evapotranspiration and partial root zone drying alternated irrigation of the root zone by watering in one furrow and keeping dry the adjacent furrow until the next watering cycle are reported as the promising irrigation techniques to save water with a concomitant increase in wue or wp without significant tuber yield reduction jovanovic et al 2010 jensen et al 2010 xie et al 2012 several studies have shown that partial root drying technique can save water by 39 50 than a deficit or full irrigation yactayo et al 2013 xu et al 2011 obtained higher tuber yield with partial root drying when water restriction was initiated soon after tuber initiation both in the pot and in field trials traditionally irrigating to each and every furrow is one of the oldest techniques of surface irrigation this technique still remains a common method for irrigation of row crops across the world koech et al 2014 including south asia and in particular in bangladesh the traditional surface furrow irrigation method however uses a high amount of water and hence needs improvement to raise its water use efficiency sharma and minhas 2005 jat et al 2011 sarker et al 2016 on the other hand drip irrigation has been found to be one of the most efficient irrigation methods globally especially in the areas with limited and expensive water supplies hezarjaribi et al 2008 however considering the economic condition of farmers in bangladesh and across south asia the drip irrigation system is expensive due to its high initial investments and will hardly be affordable by the small and medium farmers raised bed furrows which are the improved and efficient versions of surface flat furrows are small channels which can easily be made parallel to carry irrigation water and to provide a favorable environment for crop growth yactayo et al 2013 the raised bed alternate furrow irrigation technique is established based on partial root zone drying in soil that creates the root to shoot chemical signal this process results in stomatal closure for reducing water loss a small narrowing of the stomata opening may reduce water and nutrient loss without any significant effect on photosynthesis davies and zhang 1991 in the alternate furrow irrigation water is normally applied approximately to half of the root system while the remaining half is dried stikic et al 2003 the alternate wetting and drying sides of the root system are alternated in a frequency according to crop growth stages and soil water balance yactayo et al 2013 the understanding of this process is essential for the successful application of the alternate wetting and drying technique alternate partial root zone irrigation may substantially reduce water loss but would have little effect on the rate of photosynthesis partial root zone drying irrigation prdi including alternate prdi and fixed prdi are new water saving irrigation techniques and could improve the wue or wp of potato without significant yield reduction kang and zhang 2004 there are many studies about the effects of prdi on crop physiology growth nutrient uptake and wue yactayo et al 2013 hu et al 2009 li et al 2007 nutrient and water requirements are closely related fertilizer application is likely to increase the efficiency of crops in utilizing available water farooq et al 2009 transpiration is inhibited by drought but this may not necessarily affect nutrient uptake in a similar manner currently it is evident that crop yield can be substantially improved by enhancing the plant nutrient efficiency under limited moisture supply fageria et al 2008 the heterogeneous soil moisture distribution may affect soil enzymatic activities and crop water use organic n plays a major role in enhancing canopy wue and soil enzymatic activities fertilization too can affect soil enzymatic activities li et al 2010 indeed prdi creates an uneven distribution of soil moisture that may affect many processes including many soil enzymatic activities wang et al 2008 in the current changing climate scenario the major challenge for the south asia researchers is to develop an alternate system or method of irrigation water application which is energy water and labor efficient and can produce more with less cost or less water many studies have shown that furrow irrigation can reduce irrigation water and substantially improve the wue ebrahimian and playan 2014 koech et al 2014 reddi and reddy 2009 jat et al 2005 growing potatoes with alternate furrow irrigation afi in raised beds technique could be attractive to bangladeshi and south asia farmers due to its requirements for comparatively low initial capital and on going maintenance costs and low energy and its easiness in use by unskilled labor however afi has not yet been investigated for potato cultivation in bangladesh and large parts of south asia we hypothesize that afi would maintain yield reduce water use and increase the irrigation wp for potato cultivation in drought prone areas of bangladesh where water resources are scarce in response to this research gap we compared the potato grown under raised beds with afi together with every furrow irrigation efi and fixed furrow irrigation ffi each with two levels of irrigation and assessed the dry matter production tuber yield water productivity and n p k zn b and total soluble solids tss contents in potato tubers in the tropical central bangladesh

in 2015 and on 22 november in 2016 with the row to row ridge top center to ridge top center distance of 60 cm and plant to plant spacing of 25 cm potato tubers were planted manually by hand at the time of plant establishment the same amount of irrigation water was applied in every furrow in all treatments and the irrigation treatments were initiated after plant establishment the recommended

followed by irrigation adequate plant protection measures were taken whenever required 2 4 soil moisture content irrigation water application and water use gravimetric soil moisture content was determined before each irrigation event the soils were sampled from both the center of the raised beds and bottom of the furrows from 0 150 150 300 and 300 450 mm soil depths at the time of planting to harvest the soil samples were taken from each plot in 150 mm depth increment from the soil surface well mixed together subsampled weighed dried at 105 c for 72 h and reweighed and gravimetric

irrigation water was based on soil water content and applied to field capacity only each treatment plot was separated by 1 5 m to prevent the lateral movement of water from one plot to another and hence there was no surface runoff hence parameters were considered negligible and hence were not taken into account during calculation δ swc is the change in soil water contribution before planting

developed by the r foundation for statistical computing platform r core team 2014 all the treatment means were subjected to analysis of variance anova and analyzed following randomized complete block design rcbd and compared for any significant differences using r statistical models at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 dry matter content the total dry matter tdm and dry matter partitioning of the potato plants as influenced by treatments at different growth stages over two years are presented in figs 3 5 there was a significant effect of the year fig 3 a on tdm and dry matter partitioning to root leaf and tuber of potato plants fig 4 there was a significant effect p 0 001 of the year fig 3a and treatment fig 3b on the tdm as well as dry matter partitioning to root stem leaf and tubers figs 4 and 5 at different growth stages the mean values over two years 2016 and 2017 indicate that tdm of the potato plants was significantly different p 0 001 among the treatments whereas the treatments afi and efi had no significant difference at the later growth stage i e 76 85 dap fig 3b the results also indicate that the year and treatment effects had no significant differences at the harvesting stage tdm was significantly lower in ffi than afi and efi when the number of irrigation events and the amount of applied water were reduced at different growth stages of potato plants at 22 27 dap tdr was insignificantly lower by around 5 in afi and significantly p 0 001 lower by around 14 in ffi compared to traditional efi at 41 42 dap the effect of the year had significant p 0 05 difference on tdm fig 3a but root stem and tuber had no significant differences figs 4 and 5 on the other hand the irrigation level method had highly significant p 0 001 at 41 42 dap fig 3b similarly the interactive effect of year and treatment had a significant difference in tdm at tuber development stage 63 64 dap the year had no significant difference on tdr fig 3a but the effect of treatment fig 3b and interactive effect of year and treatment had a significant difference on tdr and its partitioning to root leaf and tuber the results also indicated that the dry matter partitioning differed significantly among the methods figs 4 and 5 at the later growth stages the greater amount of dry matter was partitioned to tubers compared to that in the initial stage figs 4 and 5 thus ffi also significantly p 0 001 affected the tdm and its partitioning at different growth stages of potato plants 3 2 tuber numbers and tuber yield the analysis of variance anova and the mean values of tuber yield of potato is presented in table 2 there was no significant year effect but a significant effect was recorded on tuber yield and tuber number of potato fresh potato tuber yields were significantly different among the treatments although there were no significant differences between afi 22 3 t ha 1 and efi 23 1 t ha 1 with three irrigations and between afi 23 9 t ha 1 and efi 24 6 t ha 1 with four irrigations during 2016 table 2 similar trends were observed during 2017 though total tuber yield in this year was slightly lower compared to that in 2016 when irrigated either three or four times in 2017 fresh tuber weight m2 and tuber yield varied significantly among the treatments but not between afi 21 52 t ha 1 and efi 21 49 t ha 1 with three irrigations and between afi 22 60 t ha 1 and efi 23 17 t ha 1 with four irrigations table 2 tuber numbers per plant and tuber weight m2 were not significantly different between afi and efi but were greater than that of ffi in both years in the combined analysis treatment means of yield contributing characters of potato plants insignificantly influenced between afi and efi when irrigated with i1 and i2 table 2 on an average the total tuber yield produced almost similar in afi by 21 89 and 22 22 t ha 1and efi by 23 26 and 23 92 t ha 1 when irrigated with i1 and i2 over two the two growing seasons in general the tuber yield in ffi was significantly lower than afi and efi on an average afi produced 2 1 lower tuber yield than efi table 2 although afi saved 35 irrigation water than efi method table 3 this result indicates that irrigation levels and methods had a significant effect on tuber production the average tuber yield was related to the amount of water supply and distribution method 3 3 effect of irrigation levels and methods on water saving and water productivity water productivity wp was estimated to describe the relationship between the tuber yield and the amount of water consumed seasonal crop water use scwu and wp varied among the treatments due to the variation of irrigation water applied afi saved irrigation water by 34 7 35 4 and 35 37 9 compared to efi when irrigation was applied at three critical stages and four irrigation at evey 12 15 days interval table 3 wp of afi significantly p 0 001 increased as compared to those of efi and ffi table 3 the highest wp was 15 13 and 15 32 kg m 3 for afi followed by 10 24 kg m 3 and 10 26 kg m 3 for efi and 13 0 and 12 99 kg m 3 for ffi with three and four irrigation respectively during 2016 in 2017 also wp of afi increased substantially as compared to efi and ffi table 3 the highest wp was 14 64 and 14 48 kg m 3 for afi followed by 9 55 and 9 66 kg m 3 for efi with three and four irrigation on average the highest wp was with afi 14 89 kg m 3 and the lowest with efi 9 9 kg m 3 afi improved wp significantly p 0 001 by 47 7 53 2 and 49 3 49 9 each compared to efi with three and four irrigation respectively table 3 the results indicate that afi produced the highest water saving and wp as compared to efi and ffi table 3 on average the afi saved around 35 seasonal irrigation water than efi on the other hand wp was significantly p 0 001 increased in afi by around 50 compared to efi efi system noticeably resulted in the lowest wp but this technique also did not produce significantly higher tuber yield with three or four irrigations 3 4 effect of irrigation levels and methods on n p k zn b and tss content of potato tuber the anova showed that there was no significant effect of year on the concentration of n k and b in potato tubers but had a significant effect on p zn and tss all p 0 05 table 4 the concentrations of n k zn and b had also insignificant differences among the treatments but the concentration of p and tss had significant p 0 05 differences the interactive effect of year and treatment had also no significant differences except tss and p table 4 except for zn and p concentrations n k b and tss concentrations in potato tubers were also had non significant variations among afi ffi and efi table 4 zn and b uptake in efi and afi had no significant differences but uptake was slightly higher in efi compared to afi with the increased number of irrigation events the concentrations of nutrients between afi and efi had no significant differences when the potato was irrigated with three or four times in both years these results indicate that efi did not notably increase the contents of n p k b and zn in potato tubers with three and four irrigations and also did not decrease the contents in tubers with deficit water supply during the crop growth period the content of tss of the potato tuber was also not significantly different between afi and efi table 4 4 discussion potato has been playing an important role in the food security of bangladesh as well as in south asia productivity and quality of potato tubers largely depend on the precise use of irrigation water the amount of water applied and its timing and method of water application are vital for better growth of the potato plant and tuber yield ati et al 2012 as the availability of irrigation water is becoming scarce and expensive worldwide it is important to find out the alternative ways of irrigation for meeting crop water requirement and high tuber yield despite the scarcity of irrigation water it is possible to increase the potato productivity by adopting the modern irrigation techniques or methods during the growing season ati et al 2012 kashyap and panda 2003 panigrahi et al 2001 consequently the adoption of water saving irrigation techniques such as the drip or sprinkler methods are increasingly being used in areas where irrigation water is limited these techniques are well proved in many countries to increase the yield and water productivity of different crops kang et al 2004 kumar et al 2009 ati et al 2012 however in bangladesh and large parts of south asia these techniques have not been used in large scale as these need higher initial investments and technical knowledge which most small to medium scale farmers may not be able to afford or acquire such farmers need simple easy to operate but efficient and low cost technology such as alternate furrow irrigation afi or every furrow irrigation efi which can use drastically less amount of water the idea of afi has been introduced from partial root zone drying technique which significantly improves water use efficiency wue without significant reduction in crop yield and quality majumdar 2004 reddi and reddy 2009 sarker et al 2016 in this study we examined the afi water saving technique and compared it with efi and ffi with two levels of irrigation to each technique on tuber yield tuber quality and wp of potato at field conditions fig 2 the results of this study indicate that among the three furrow irrigation techniques afi and efi produced significantly higher dry matter yield of potato compared to the ffi technique these results are in agreement with the findings of saha et al 2015 the results also indicate that the afi technique maintained desired yield when irrigation was applied in alternate furrows and kept the previously irrigated furrows dried earlier findings indicate that the wp of potatoes varied from 9 to 25 kg m 3 in different climates jovanovic et al 2010 ahmadi et al 2010 li et al 2007 islam et al 1990 reported that irrigation at 40 depletion of available soil moisture produced maximum potato yield 22 3 t ha and wue 8 1 kg m 3 in this study the wp of potato tubers varied from 9 5 to 15 3 kg m 3 and tuber yield varied from 19 5 to 24 5 t ha 1 table 3 which are consistent with the above studies our results are also inconsistent to many other studies who have reported that wp of potato tubers is substantially improved under deficit irrigation technique compared with full irrigation ierna and mauromicale 2018 badr et al 2012 darwish et al 2006 yuan et al 2003 mean values of over two years of this study indicated that afi saved irrigation water by 35 and significantly improved wp by 50 compared to traditional efi method of irrigation alternate drying irrigation technique has proved that it is an effective water saving irrigation method not only for potato cultivation but also for other crops such as maize kang and zhang 2004 and tomato sarker et al 2016 the afi efficiently utilizes soil moisture and improves soil enzymatic activities li et al 2010 sarker et al 2016 found that the alternate wetting and drying furrow irrigation technique saved irrigation water by 35 38 and improved wp by upto 40 compared to traditional efi for tomato cultivation ierna et al 2018 and hatfield et al 2001 suggested that wp could be increased from 25 to 40 through better agronomic practices which involve improved soil tillage nutrient and water management practices in most cases partial root drying technique has shown a great potential to increase wue and to maintain yield davies and hartung 2004 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 on the other hand the tuber yield of potatoes was decreased in the partial root drying irrigation liu et al 2005 in our study the potato tuber yield was insignificantly decreased in the afi compared to traditional efi table 2 this might be due to the earlier soil drying and mild water stress effect on early growth for tuber initiation liu et al 2005 2006 the tuber yields and wp of potato were significantly reduced in ffi than afi and efi due to the effect of water stress on the growth of potato plant for fixed drying of soil during the growing period table 2 a successful afi management depends on crops and cultivars growing periods evaporative demands soil texture and soil water balance the results indicate that irrigation level is also important and has significantly influenced on crop growth and yield in other studies the irrigation method had no significant effects on growth and tuber yields of potato but the irrigation levels significantly affected the tuber yield and yield contributing characters of potato e g onder et al 2005 tuber yield reduction could be avoided by controlling soil water as well as reducing n in this study basal fertilizers were placed below the soil surface as the lateral separation between potato seed and fertilizer fig 2 which could reduce the losses of soil nutrients nutrient and water have close relationships so that sub surface fertilizer application increases the crop nutrient efficiency in utilizing available water farooq et al 2009 the drought sensitive crops such as potato generally close their stomata when subjected to water stress ahmadi et al 2010 transpiration may be inhibited by alternate drying but this may not necessarily affect nutrient uptake in a similar way the technique of partial root drying increased the above ground plant dry matter and tuber fresh weight compared to full irrigation due to the maintenance of the optimal range of soil water content shahnazari et al 2007 the results reveal that total dry matter was significantly reduced in ffi than efi but increased with these techniques when irrigation level was increased figs 3 and 4 it indicates that the increase in water supply and fertilization led to greater total dry matter production in all growth stages of potato ierna and mauromicale 2018 camargo et al 2015 the results also reveal that afi technique has a positive influence on total dry matter figs 3a and 4 production and its partitioning figs 3b and 5 due to reduced transpiration loss by slightly limiting stomata opening of the potato plant many studies indicate that the plant roots in drying soil produce a root hormonal signal to the shoot that may restrict the transpiration through stomata off on but continue allowing photosynthesis and growth and resulting in higher wue davies and zhang 1991 zhang and davies 1989 therefore it is evident that yields could be improved by enhancing the plant nutrient efficiency under controlled irrigation water supply several studies also demonstrated that afi may improve product quality of potato plants zegbe et al 2004 shahnazari et al 2007 we noticed that the potato plants with afi showed green looking in all growth stages which might have contributed to the higher marketable tuber yields in afi shahnazari et al 2008 the possible reason could be that applying sub surface fertilizers increased soil available p content during the entire growing season and restricted the phosphatase from roots and thus could have maintained the energy level under stress conditions richardson et al 2011 alternate drying technique extends the root system to deeper layers and incites the initiation of secondary roots which can take up both water and nutrients from the soil and stimulate the growth of the plant kolbe and stephan beckmann 1997 hu et al 2009 liu et al 2005 the afi technique increases n uptake and reduces no3 leaching when irrigation water is alternately allowed to the wetted and dried sides of the root system during the growth stages of the crop skinner et al 1999 our study revealed that the water saving technique of afi did not significantly decrease the concentration of the nutrients of potato tubers compared to traditional efi table 4 these results indicate that afi and efi notably increased tss when irrigated with either three or four irrigations several studies also demonstrated that afi can improve product quality of potato plants zegbe et al 2004 shahnazari et al 2007 nutrient losses could be reduced by reducing water application during the tuber initiation and lengthening of the potato growth period han and kang 2002 reported that total n and p use efficiency was increased with the partial root drying technique compared to the traditional full irrigation prolonged soil drying may reduce the succulent roots for water conduction to main roots li et al 2007 from the results of the fixed furrow and traditional furrow irrigation indicates that prolonged wetting and drying also may affect the quality and tuber yield of potato during the growing period alternately wetting the soil may encourage the initiation and growth of secondary roots and therefore recover the roots sensitivity to soil drying in addition alternate drying and wetting root system in soil may perform better use of soil nutrients in the whole root zone area many studies have demonstrated that partial root drying technique has the potentiality to improve the grain fruit and vegetable yields and their quality zegbe et al 2006 leib et al 2006 shahnazari et al 2007 our study showed that though the potato tuber yields with the afi and efi techniques with three or four irrigations were not significantly different afi performed better in terms of reducing water use and increasing wp than efi both afi and efi were superior to ffi in terms of tuber yield and wp parameters results also showed that the afi water saving technique imposed up to maturity can maintain tuber yields as that of efi but can significantly reduce water use and increase wp of potato from the results of this study and the above discussion it can be inferred that the afi has the potential to improve the wp of potato without significant yield loss therefore it can be recommended as a useful irrigation water application method for potato crops grown in raised beds with furrows in the areas where irrigation water and water supplies are limited for sustainable potato production 5 conclusions the alternate furrow irrigation technique is a challenge to apply in field conditions for crop production without significant yield loss in this study we found that total dry matter yield of potato was not significantly different between alternate and every furrow irrigation techniques fresh yields of potato tubers were not statistically different between these techniques with three and four irrigations although every furrow irrigation produced slightly higher tuber yield than alternate furrow irrigation on average alternate furrow irrigation however saved 35 water and resulted in 50 higher water productivity compared to every furrow irrigation the n p k zn and b concentrations in potato tubers at harvest were similar for three methods of irrigation total soluble solids were nearly similar for alternate furrow and every furrow irrigation the alternate furrow irrigation technique has the potential for application in a dry environment with limited water this technique may be practiced by alternately irrigating one part of the root zone of the potato plant each time and may substantially improve the water productivity of potato without significant yield reduction due to the scarcity of irrigation water at present conditions demonstrations are necessary to identify the role of alternate furrow irrigation technique for optimum plant growth and yield of potato and other raised bed row crops which can be adapted easily to the areas where water is limited and the water savings goals can be achieved further studies are required to understand the alternate furrow irrigation technique with various soil types and raised beds for improving the water productivity and tuber quality without drastically reducing the tuber yield in south asia acknowledgements the study was based on the core funded research

10886,a well tested crop model can be an important tool in assessment of different crop management scenarios to improve crop yield and water productivity in this study the fao aquacrop model was evaluated for predicting maize zea mays l canopy cover cc available soil water asw grain yield crop evapotranspiration etc and water use efficiency wue when grown at three different planting dates and densities under rainfed and subsurface drip irrigated conditions in nebraska usa the model adequately simulated cc in 2011 with root mean squared error rmse and model efficiency ef in the range of 5 3 to 12 7 and 0 42 to 0 94 respectively while in drier 2012 cc was substantially under predicted with higher rmse of 24 4 asw was consistently underestimated in both years with negative ef value for most treatments in 2011 while in 2012 this trend was more pronounced in irrigated treatments especially during mid season etc estimates were marginal with prediction error of up to 15 in 2011 and 18 in 2012 and overall rmse of 35 mm for both years simulated grain yield was acceptable in 2011 with deviations from measured data up to 8 while in 2012 the deviations were much higher up to 40 for rainfed treatments with overestimations in both years the errors in etc and yield simulations are considered high especially when considering the model application in water limiting or and rainfed conditions and low yielding areas in which these errors can be a substantial portion of the total yields produced and in seasonal total etc from production fields and can cause challenges for growers

potential reasons for the discrepancies and areas that require improvements in the model are presented keywords model performance available soil water water use efficiency water stress deficit irrigation subsurface drip irrigation 1 introduction sustainable utilization of resources in agriculture and narrowing yield gaps for all crops play a key role in providing sufficient food for rapidly increasing world population tittonell and giller 2013 low and non uniformly distributed rainfall as well as water limitation and crisis scenarios limiting further expansion of irrigation pose a major challenge to improve increase crop production such challenges in agriculture can be addressed through proper agronomic management strategies including effective soil crop and irrigation management appropriate planting population density and planting dates selection of improved hybrids and crop protection to maximize crop productivity these are especially necessary practices to enhance productivity and efficiency of production of major agronomic row crops grown worldwide including maize maize is one of the most important and widely distributed cereal crops in the world accounting for around 1 05 billion metric tons of global production about one third of the global maize production occurs in the u s a making it the largest maize producer in the world nebraska is one of the leading maize cultivation states in the u s a accounting for more than 36 million hectares harvested in 2017 and a total crop production of 42 7 million metric tons united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass 2017 however this productivity is highly influenced by the local crop soil and irrigation management practices and the maize productivity can have significant impact on food supply and demands in addition high growing season and inter annual variability in rainfall amounts and distribution especially in semi arid conditions of nebraska further necessitates the adoption of appropriate crop production techniques to optimize yield maize yield is influenced by several factors such as weather conditions hybrid soil conditions weed pressure diseases nutrient deficiency irrigation and crop management practices crop yield is highly influenced by water availability which is also affected by inter annual variability in rainfall patterns thus requiring timely irrigation practices such variability in rainfall becomes a deciding factor in estimating the appropriate dates of planting to prevent water stress besides in the past few decades availability of improved crop hybrids with higher tolerance to increased planting population densities has improved crop yields consistently duvick 2005 therefore it is important to investigate and determine optimum planting population densities planting dates and irrigation amounts and their interactions to maximize grain yield and crop water productivity plant population density ppd is one of the major factors impacting crop yield and water use increase in ppd usually results in more grain due to early canopy closure that maximizes light interception and decreases soil surface evaporation westgate et al 1997 however when ppd is above certain level the grain yield tends to decline because of limited availability of intercepted radiation nutrients and water under intense interplant competition griesh and yakout 2001 required optimum ppds vary widely from region to region depending on environmental conditions and hybrids for instance higher ppds may be adopted for high rainfall or irrigation conditions while low ppds are usually recommended for rainfed or dryland conditions in the central us corn belt average maize ppd has increased from 30 000 plants per hectare pph in the 1930s to 80 000 plants ha 1 or greater at present duvick et al 2004 this is because of the adaption of newer hybrids to high planting densities and increased stress resistance for higher yield production li et al 2015 studied the impact of ppds ranging from 15 000 to 180 000 pph under no water stress on grain yield and reported that grain yield was significantly impacted by ppd ranges of 47 000 pph 47 000 83 000 pph and 107 000 pph while ppd of 83 000 107 500 pph was grain yield stable range teasdale 1998 reported increase in grain yield when ppd increased from 64 000 to 90 000 pph in one year and linear decline of yield in dry year in maryland cox and cherney 2001 reported similar maize silage yield for ppds of 80 000 to 116 000 pph in aurora new york el hendawy et al 2008 studied maize yield response to three ppds 48 000 pph 71 000 pph and 95 000 pph under three irrigation rates including full irrigation treatment fit 80 of fit and 60 of fit they reported highest grain yield for ppd of 48 000 pph under full irrigation for drip irrigated maize in sandy soil and concluded that yield increased with increasing irrigation rates and decreasing ppd irmak and djaman 2016 reported that there is a certain optimum combination of ppd and planting date to achieve maximum yield that also depends on the climatic conditions in a given year when investigating maize yield response to three ppds 59 300 74 100 and 88 900 pph and three planting dates under subsurface drip irrigation and rainfed conditions in nebraska usa this implies that the planting date is an important management factor affecting maize yield in the context of climate change selection of optimum planting date window based on the onset of the rainy season is critical to improving crop grain yield and productivity the planting dates have been progressing towards earlier dates contributing to the increased maize yield in different usa growing regions bruns and abbas 2006 delayed planting after late april in mid south bruns and abbas 2006 and after june in southeast may result in significant yield reductions and more frequent infestation of pests and diseases swanson and wilhelm 1996 however later planting dates can produce greater yield than earlier planting in dryland conditions planting maize before or after the optimum date was reported to result in reduced leaf area index total dry matter production and grain yield swanson and wilhelm 1996 planting date of high yielding usa maize regions for latitude groups between 25 and 30 30 and 35 35 and 40 40 and 45 and 45 and 50 n was 42 and 88 89 and 106 107 and 118 119 and 128 and 129 and 135 day of year respectively for each latitude range as reported by long et al 2017 thus selection of appropriate planting dates is also one of the important factors to ensure maximum productivity the aforementioned results indicate the necessity of evaluation and determination of local optimal planting dates and densities under rainfed as well as irrigated conditions for maximizing utilization of available resources improve crop yield and productivity however it is not feasible to evaluate combination of large number of crop management options in field conditions for many different regions and environmental conditions due to time finance and resource constraints in this context a well tested calibrated and validated crop model can serve as an important tool to evaluate maize response to the factors influencing yield and water use efficiency in some cases crop models have proven to be useful in simulating some of the crop management scenarios using fewer resources heng et al 2009 concluded that the fao aquacrop model is very useful for the design and evaluation of water management options and for studying the effect of location soil type and sowing date under rainfed and irrigated crop production although numerous crop models of varying complexities have been developed including crop syst stöckle et al 2003 epic cavero et al 2000 ko et al 2009 dssat jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2017 wofost boogaard et al 1998 and stics brisson et al 1998 2002 most of these models are quite demanding sophisticated and require highly detailed input parameters which limit their applicability moreover unavailability of open access source code and lack of proper user support documentation in some cases inhibits the use of model by people other than the model developers in this context a recently developed aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 has been suggested to be a user friendly model that uses relatively small number of input parameters that are explicit and mostly intuitive as compared with other crop models and attempts to balance simplicity accuracy and robustness the model is transparent in formulation well supported with comprehensive documentation for end users and easy to use besides the model performance has been successfully evaluated for several crops including maize hsiao et al 2009 soybean paredes et al 2015 wheat stricevic et al 2011 barley araya et al 2010 and sunflower stricevic et al 2011 however implementation of any model for practical purposes require evaluation calibration and validation using field measurements from different climatic regions under different water management conditions to ensure accuracy and understand potential limitations of the model thus if aquacrop is to be adopted by the end users it must be able to simulate crop yield and yield influencing factors reasonably well which requires site specific and careful testing calibration and validation of model the overall goal of this study was to explore the applicability of aquacrop model in investigating optimum site specific maize management strategies to maximize crop yield and productivity to the best of our knowledge this research is the first and foremost resource to evaluate aquacrop for semi arid conditions of nebraska in the context of model performance relative to different planting densities and dates under varying water management scenarios using data from extensive and carefully conducted multi year field research due to its inter annual variable climatic conditions such as rainfall patterns and amounts air temperatures and evaporative demand nebraska is an ideal research location to test different crop management strategies many crop research experiments have been and are being continuously conducted at south central agricultural laboratory scal near clay center nebraska since 2003 by the senior author s irmak therefore availability of abundant and extensive long term field measured datasets for almost all crop variables under different irrigation methods center pivot subsurface drip and gravity under different crop water and soil tillage management practices are very valuable and unique in regards to comprehensive assessment of model performance at this location this study is unprecedented in its inclusion of all field measured crop parameters including canopy cover total soil water in the root zone agronomic practices irrigation date and amounts crop evapotranspiration grain yield and water use efficiency which in many cases is mostly lacking in other research reports because availability of such extensive datasets on all crop variables is a very challenging task though it is highly important and desirable in modelling approaches this research will provide fair and trustworthy information about model performance relative to each of the above mentioned crop parameter evaluate the extent of the model s applicability for nebraska conditions assess model s performance and potential limitations and provide suggestions for improvements in the model which will enhance the prediction accuracy the hypothesis of this study was that aquacrop can be employed in selecting adaptive crop management practices to improve maize yield and productivity in semi arid conditions of nebraska with sufficient accuracy sandhu and irmak 2019 evaluated the aquacrop model using six years 2005 2010 of field measured maize data in which they suggested that default parameters provide highly inaccurate results and a set of calibrated parameters were developed that improved the model performance as compared with the default parameters after appropriate calibration and validation therefore the specific objective of this study was to investigate the performance of aquacrop model for different management practices relative to three planting densities ranging from low to high and three planting dates from early to late dates under irrigated and rainfed conditions this information will shed light on the extent of applicability of the model for nebraska conditions and aid crop growers researchers policy makers and extension professionals in assessing and reducing risks of crop failure yield loss and achieve maximum profits by adopting appropriate crop and in season water management strategies selected in advance based on modelling 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site and experimental design the extensive field data used in this study were obtained from experiments conducted by the senior author at the university of nebraska lincoln south central agricultural laboratory scal 40 34 n and 98 8 w at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska during growing seasons of 2011 and 2012 the experiment details and procedures were outlined by irmak and djaman 2016 and are briefly discussed here the research site lies in the transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climate zones with the mean annual precipitation of 731 mm mean annual temperature of 10 3 c and mean annual snowfall of 381 mm u s climate data 2018 significant annual and growing season variability of precipitation in both magnitude and timing requires supplemental irrigation especially for a high water user crops like maize the major soil type at the site is a hastings silt loam which is a well drained upland soil fine montmorillonitic mesic udic argiustoll with particle size distribution of 15 sand 65 silt and 20 clay with 2 5 organic matter content in the topsoil irmak 2010 the soil at the site has field capacity of 0 34 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point of 0 14 m3 m 3 saturation point of 0 53 m3 m 3 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of 430 mm day 1 and the effective rooting depth of maize at the site is 1 50 m the experiment was laid out in a field covering an area of 13 5 ha and irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation sdi system that was installed in 2004 maize hybrid mycogen 2d770 was planted on three dates may 4 16 and 23 and was harvested on november 3 in the 2011 growing season in 2012 similar maize hybrid mycogen 2v707 was planted on april 24 may 8 and may 17 and was harvested on october 9 besides three planting dates which were referred to as first planting fp second planting sp and third planting tp three plant population densities p of 59 300 74 100 and 88 900 plants per hectare pph referred to as p1 p2 and p3 were evaluated during both growing seasons all treatments were further investigated under irrigated as well as rainfed settings therefore a total of 18 treatments were studied in this experiment using a completely randomized block design with four replications maize was planted at soil depth of 0 05 m in the east west direction with plant row spacing of 0 76 m in both seasons the plots were fertilized uniformly and all herbicide fungicide and insecticides were applied uniformly when needed irmak and djaman 2016 irrigation timing and amounts varied due to differences in ppd and planting dates during both years 2 2 weather trends at research site the weather data including rainfall maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed in both growing seasons were measured using a bowen ratio energy balance system brebs installed in the research field as part of the nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 the overall climate trends during 2011 and 2012 growing seasons for precipitation and grass reference evapotranspiration eto are presented in fig 1 the 2011 growing season received greater amount of precipitation 349 mm than 2012 growing season 285 mm there was a relatively uniform distribution of precipitation events in 2011 throughout the growing season except for few dry periods may was the wettest month with the same precipitation amount of about 120 mm in both years which coincided with early vegetative growth stages of maize indicating that there was enough soil moisture at the start of growing season for emergence and the soil water was uniformly distributed in the experimental field only very small amounts of precipitation were observed during july and august corresponding to water intensive water stress sensitive stages of maize silking and grain filling and these effects were more pronounced in 2012 growing season the maximum air temperatures tmax were greater in 2012 than in 2011 the mean air temperatures tmean during early growth stages in may and june were greater in 2012 by 2 7 and 1 5 c respectively as compared with 2011 similarly vapor pressure deficits were substantially higher in 2012 than 2011 indicating very high atmospheric evaporative demands in 2012 and the mean relative humidity was higher in 2011 than in 2012 2 3 field research data the data collected in the field included weather data leaf area index lai soil water content swc and grain yield and other variables that were derived from field measured data including crop evapotranspiration etc eto and crop water use efficiency wue irmak and djaman 2016 lai was measured every ten days from each treatment for both growing seasons using a leaf canopy analyzer li cor 2200 li cor biosciences lincoln nebraska usa the volumetric soil water content was measured using a model 4302 neutron attenuation probe troxler electronics laboratories inc nc usa at 0 30 0 60 0 90 1 20 1 50 and 1 80 m soil depths twice a week throughout both growing seasons in two replications of each treatment the neutron probe access tubes were installed between two plants in the middle plant row the neutron probe measurements were used for analyzing soil water content dynamics and determine etc using a soil water balance approach seasonal etc was calculated using a general soil water balance approach 1 etc p i u r d δsws where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation water

use treatment and other condition the curve numbers of 75 was used deep percolation was calculated using a daily water balance computer program as mentioned in djaman and irmak 2012 maize was harvested using a plot combine with an eight row head to measure grain yield per plot and was adjusted to the 15 5 grain moisture content wue was calculated to determine maize water productivity response to treatments using the following equation 2 wue y etc where wue is expressed in kg m 3 on a unit water volume basis and y is grain yield g m 2 2 4 aquacrop model description aquacrop is suggested as a user friendly and practitioner oriented type of model which consists of four sub models 1 the atmosphere sub model consisting of rainfall eto and co2 concentration 2 crop sub model involving crop growth development senescence and yield 3 management sub model that includes irrigation and field management practices 4 soil sub model that handles soil water balance with a daily time step the model simulates successively the four major processes of crop production including crop development transpiration tr above ground biomass production and yield first aquacrop simulates crop growth development and senescence using green canopy cover cc the cc is then used with eto and coefficient for transpiration kctr to calculate transpiration similarly soil evaporation coefficient is used with cc and eto to calculate soil evaporation daily transpiration tri is translated into a proportional amount of daily aboveground biomass produced bi through biomass water productivity of crop normalized for evaporative demand and atmospheric co2 wp as 3 b i w p t r i e t o i the model simulates soil water balance by keeping track of incoming rainfall irrigation and capillary rise and outgoing r etc and d water fluxes at the boundaries of the root zone the effects of water stress on the crop are expressed through four stress response coefficients that are functions of fractional depletion of total available soil water in the crop root zone these coefficients include canopy expansion stomatal conductance canopy senescence and harvest index hi with their own level of sensitivity to water stress crop yield is calculated by multiplying the simulated above ground biomass with the reference hi which is continuously adjusted during yield formation based on its response to water and or temperature stresses additional underlying concepts principles and assumptions of the model are described in detail by steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 and hsiao et al 2009 2 5 aquacrop input data and calibration aquacrop model tends to maintain balance between accuracy simplicity and robustness that uses a moderate number of input parameters these input parameters are specified in climate crop soil and management files and can be modified by the user these are separated into two distinct categories 1 conservative parameters that do not change with time management practices or location and are provided as default values in the model 2 non conservative parameters also known as user cultivar specific parameters that can vary from year to year with location or between various crop varieties and should be observed in the field or provided by the user the conservative parameters include canopy growth cgc and canopy decline coefficient cdc crop coefficient for transpiration tr normalized water productivity wp soil water depletion thresholds for the inhibition leaf growth stomatal conductance and acceleration of canopy senescence reference harvest index hio and coefficients for adjusting harvest index hi in relation to inhibition of leaf growth and of stomatal conductance besides conservative parameters the user specific information include weather and soil information plant density and irrigation as well as the specifics of the selected crop cultivar the climate data required by the model consists of five daily weather input variables minimum and maximum air temperatures eto precipitation and the mean annual co2 concentration in the atmosphere in this study the first four weather variables for 2011 and 2012 were obtained from the brebs flux tower that was installed in the experimental field as discussed earlier the co2 concentration is the annual mean value that was measured by the mauna loa observatory in hawaii and the model has inbuilt files for past and current co2 concentration values while the user can enter future year s co2 values in the model the values for non conservative parameters in the crop tab such as plant density time of sowing maximum root depth etc were obtained from irmak and djaman 2016 based on the field measurements while the values for conservative parameters were obtained from sandhu and irmak 2019 that were calibrated using extensive field datasets from irmak 2015a b for maize growing season of 2009 and validated for 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 growing seasons extensive calibration procedures were applied to have a robust and fair calibration of the model to obtain justifiable validations it should be noted that in most cases it is neither necessary nor possible to measure all input parameters variables in the field continuously to calibrate and or validate the model however the performance of the model in terms of simulating some of the critical singular processes i e transpiration can be assessed though modularity structure of the model by simulating the parameters variables that strongly influence those critical processes i e transpiration for example in this study the performance of aquacrop model in simulating transpiration was assessed in terms of model s performance in estimating cc development and biomass production the calibration procedure used in sandhu and irmak 2019 was performed using the guidelines outlined in the aquacrop reference manual and fao irrigation and drainage paper no 66 crop yield response to water steduto et al 2012 and is briefly discussed here the crop phenology is primarily guided by the type of cultivar and air temperature raes et al 2009 therefore growing degree day gdd mode was used to run the model and crop stage lengths were adjusted based on field observations the aquacrop windows version 6 0 was used and field measured data of 2009 growing season was used for calibration first the canopy cover cc curve parameters were quantified iteratively using trial and error approach until the simulated values were close to the field observed values the crop growth stages including time to emergence maximum cc start of canopy senescence and maturity were adjusted based on field measured data next the calibration of parameters affecting soil water dynamics was performed followed by calibration of biomass and yield by adjusting the water productivity and the transpiration crop coefficient then the final yield was simulated by adjustment of harvest index to match with measured yields the calibrated parameters obtained by sandhu and irmak 2019 as well as the model default parameters were used in this study to test the performance of model under different planting densities and dates under both rainfed and irrigated conditions during 2011 and 2012 growing seasons the calibrated model by sandhu and irmak 2019 indicated good agreement between simulated and field measured cc r2 0 86 ef 0 83 and nrmse 7 3 soil water content in the root zone r2 0 88 ef 0 61 and nrmse 5 2 crop evapotranspiration r2 0 97 ef 0 80 and nrmse 3 2 and final grain yield r2 0 99 ef 0 80 and nrmse 7 7 the nrmse indicates the normalized root mean square error values the model performance varied during validation from year to year such that the performance declined in conditions of very high water stress dry 2005 2006 years but was acceptable during normal years having precipitation close to long term average the present study is continuation of model validation and evaluation for different planting densities and dates under both irrigated and rainfed conditions the other input data for the model included management parameters such as field and irrigation information soil data including field capacity permanent wilting point saturation point and saturated hydraulic conductivity and groundwater table depth that were obtained from the field measurements irmak and djaman 2016 in 2011 and 2012 growing seasons the soil properties such as curve number and saturated hydraulic conductivity were further fine tuned during calibration and determined iteratively against field measured soil water content and etc by sandhu and irmak 2019 similarly stress factors affecting canopy expansion stomatal closure and crop senescence were adjusted to obtain close match between simulated and observed values under conditions of no water stress as well as under rainfed conditions the hi value was adjusted for different planting densities in this study some studies have reported that hi increases with increase in ppd and decreases after the optimal ppd is reached delougherty and crookston 1979 rahmati 2009 therefore adopting same value of hi for all ppds might lead to error s in estimation of crop yield in this study default hi value of 48 was used for lowest ppd of 59 300 pph p1 for p2 and p3 hi of 54 was adopted based on the value reported by djaman et al 2013 input data for simulation tabs included simulation period initial conditions and field data information simulation period was based on the planting and harvesting dates of the crop in each year for initial conditions the soil profile was considered to be near soil field capacity one of the reasons for this assumption is that there is an ample rainfall and snow event before the start of maize growing season in the experimental region that usually recharges the soil water to near field capacity however to confirm this assumption the simulations started from the day of high rainfall event and continued towards the maize planting date in each year that resulted in soil water content to be at or very close to field capacity the measured soil water content throughout each growing season was converted to available soil water asw to be inputted into the field data tab the field measured lai was used to estimate green canopy cover following the procedure outlined in hsiao et al 2009 2 6 model evaluation as discussed earlier the model calibration parameters already suggested by sandhu and irmak 2019 were used to run the model and are presented in table 1 the model was evaluated for 2011 and 2012 growing season for its performance in simulating cc asw yield etc and wue under different planting dates and ppds the output of aquacrop model in comparison with the field measurements was assessed using both qualitative and quantitative approaches where the qualitative approach included graphical interpretation of results to evaluate the trends in simulated and field measured data and the

test was also conducted for alpha value of 0 05 for statistical comparisons of simulated and field measured variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 canopy cover cc canopy cover cc is a crucial component of water driven aquacrop model and accurate estimation of this variable is essential for the model to produce good acceptable estimates of etc biomass and hence grain yield in this study cc parameters that have been already calibrated by sandhu and irmak 2019 for the same study site were used to simulate the cc progression during 2011 and 2012 growing seasons and the comparisons of resulting cc curves with the measured cc for all treatments are shown in figs 2 5 the goodness of fit indicators relative to cc curves obtained using calibrated parameters are given in table 2 simulation results using default parameters without calibration indicated poor agreement data not shown between measured and simulated cc with high rmse values 11 to 35 in 2011 and 18 to 42 in 2012 and very low ef values that were mostly negative in all treatments except for third planting date in all plant densities in 2011 and second and third planting dates in p2 and p3 plant densities the most common trend of deviations between simulated and observed values was during earlier canopy closure phase and accelerated senescence periods stages with simulated cc resulting in shorter growing season one of the reasons for this disagreement is that maize phenology responds differently under different environmental conditions latitude is a major factor that significantly affects temperature sunshine hours and duration of crop growth such that maize gdds increases with increase in latitudes liu and xie 2013 therefore the canopy growth parameters need to be adjusted considerably for good estimation of cc development because default parameters used in the model were obtained using data measured at davis ca usa which is at much lower latitude than nebraska paredes et al 2014 reported similar results for cc curve when using default parameters indicating tendency for underestimation of observed cc values with high rmses 16 6 and low to medium model efficiency ef ranging from 0 18 to 0 71 on the contrary the model showed better prediction of cc for both growing seasons when calibrated parameters were used although there were small deviations in 2011 the model was able to capture the trend of cc development well under both irrigated and rainfed treatments as indicated by high r2 values 0 66 r2 0 98 good ef 0 42 ef 0 94 and low estimation errors 5 30 rmse 12 70 for most of the treatments under first planting fp there was a good agreement between simulated and measured cc for all planting densities throughout the growing season under both irrigated and rainfed treatments as indicated by good r2 0 66 ef 0 66 and low rmses 8 8 the small deviations between simulated and observed cc especially during mid season stages might be the result of sampling errors under second planting sp the agreement between simulated and observed cc was good except for p1 and p3 that had low ef values of 0 42 and 0 46 and high rmse of 11 7 and 11 2 respectively under irrigated treatments however high r2 0 92 high ef 0 84 and low rmses 7 7 for all other treatments including for both rainfed and irrigated treatments indicated good model performance one of the discrepancies observed was a slight deviation for cc at the start of the growing season 33 days after planting dap where model simulated cc was lower than the observed values which was more profound in p1 and p3 planting densities similarly for third planting tp date simulated cc was lower than observed values until 39 dap moreover at the later growth stages close to 88 dap the model simulated cc was higher than the observed cc values and this trend was consistent in all ppds under both irrigated and rainfed treatments in general r2 0 86 ef 0 54 and rmses 12 7 indicated good model performance in simulation of cc for most of the treatments comparatively in 2012 the model performance declined in terms of cc simulations for all treatments substantial deviations between simulated and measured cc was consistently observed during mid season stage until senescence in all treatments and slight differences existed during early growth stage for fp and sp dates in general cc simulations indicated better performance under irrigated treatments as compared with the rainfed conditions under fp model overestimated cc until 56 dap and substantially underestimated cc development after 64 dap in both rainfed and irrigated treatments as depicted by marginal r2 0 69 low ef 0 47 and high rmses that ranged from 16 4 to 24 4 thus indicating poor model performance relatively for sp the model predictions for canopy development improved with r2 0 81 ef 0 61 and rmses in the range of 14 1 to 18 2 although some of the differences similar to those observed during fp were evident in these treatments as well however for tp the model simulated the canopy progression during early vegetative stages quite precisely as indicated by high r2 0 94 moderate ef 0 53 and rmses in the range of 11 7 to 19 8 but the disparities during mid season and later growth stages were again prevalent in all treatments overall the model substantially underestimated the canopy development during mid season and late season growth stages i e 60 50 and 52 dap for fp sp and tp dates respectively some of the reasons that could contribute towards discrepancies between model simulated and field measured cc data are discussed here first the field data indicated that statistically planting date or density did not have significant effect p 0 05 on lai in any treatment or year irmak and djaman 2016 but in aquacrop all major components including evaporation transpiration biomass soil water and yield are strictly tied to cc curve calculated from lai which could provide misleading results in some cases it was interesting and important to note that the field measured lai in much drier 2012 growing season was substantially greater than that in 2011 while the model simulations indicated opposite this indicates that the field measured results could differ substantially from the model or theoretical expectations second the model simulates green cc instead of lai to describe crop growth and development that is calculated by a relationship developed by hsiao et al 2009 to obtain cc from lai to be used in the model comparisons however some studies have reported that this relationship between lai and cc works when lai 2 m2 m 2 and for higher lai values the model predicts lower cc since cc is the first step in calibration of model it becomes very important that field observed lai is precisely converted to cc through development of accurate and site specific relationship between lai and cc nielsen et al 2012 third previously reported literature has established that the model performance declines in conditions of water stress katerji et al 2013 hsiao et al 2009 sandhu and irmak 2019 the year 2011 was wetter than 2012 with relatively more uniform distribution of precipitation throughout the growing season although both years were drier than the long term average irmak and djaman 2016 and 2012 was one of the driest and hottest years in nebraska s recorded climate history this justifies the better model performance for simulation of cc in 2011 as opposed to 2012 katerji et al 2013 reported that in stressed treatments the model simulated cc did not match observed cc after 60 dap and it systematically underestimated the maximum cc values similar trend was evitable in this current study for the 2012 growing season lastly the differences in cc can also be partially attributed to the sampling and measurement errors in lai as discussed earlier and or to the increased variation in lai in the field due to impact of extreme hot and dry conditions the rmse values obtained in this study for 2011 were similar to those reported by hsiao et al 2009 with low rmse values ranging from 4 8 to 13 6 while the rmses for 2012 were comparatively higher heng et al 2009 reported larger rmses for rainfed maize in the range of 7 2 to 34 5 that are similar or larger than those obtained in this current study for drier 2012 growing season ef values obtained in the present study were close to or smaller than those reported by heng et al 2009 that were in the range of 0 81 to 0 99 for irrigated treatments and 2 01 for rainfed treatments these results clearly exhibit the importance of careful and precise calibration of cc curve parameters to obtain accurate acceptable simulation results 3 2 available soil water asw the neutron probe measured asw in the maize root zone along with the simulated asw from aquacrop is presented in figs 6 9 when using calibrated parameters when default parameters were used the model simulated asw with very low accuracy as indicated by high rmses ranging from 43 4 to 108 mm in 2011 and from 21 to 84 mm in 2012 as well as very low ef values in the range of 4 36 to 0 38 in 2011 and 3 06 to 0 92 in 2012 table 2 only 3 treatments fpp1 spp1 and tpp1 under rainfed conditions were simulated accurately out of a total of 36 cases inclusive of both 2011 and 2012 treatments paredes et al 2014 also reported very low model performance in simulating asw when using default parameters they reported rmse values ranging from 16 to 36 mm that are similar to or lower than those obtained in this study and negative ef values ranging from 8 4 to 0 0 that are similar to the findings in this study these results indicate the need for additional adjustments in model parameters and thus the necessity of carefully calibrated parameters using measured soil water data field observations showed that treatments affected soil water uptake in both seasons and soil water depletion was higher in magnitude in 2012 as compared with 2011 due to drier conditions irmak and djaman 2016 they reported that the maximum soil water depletion occurred in the topsoil layer 0 0 30 m and minimum occurred in the deepest layers however there was decreasing trend in the soil water uptake in that layer suggesting water uptake also occurred in deeper layers the decreasing trend in soil water towards the later growing season was captured quite well by the aquacrop model as well it was observed that the model tends to simulate the soil water depletion trend well in a number of treatments but not the magnitude moreover higher soil water depletion in drier 2012 was also captured well by the model as observed in the rainfed treatments soil water data in 2012 however in most of the treatments a clear and consistent trend of underestimation of asw was evident in both years especially in the middle part of the growing season and overestimation mostly in the late season in some of the treatments in 2012 the reason for underestimation could be related to underestimation of cc as discussed in the previous section leading to inaccurate partitioning between transpiration and evaporation by the model such that the model might be simulating smaller transpiration and higher evaporative losses this indicates that despite adopting a careful parameterization and calibration the aquacrop model did not simulate asw properly hsiao et al 2009 reported that the model simulated decline in asw less than the measured values resulting in overestimation of asw by a significant amount about 80 mm for maize grown in california davis usa the goodness of fit between measured and simulated soil water data indicators presented in table 2 show that the model performance was not satisfactory in 2011 0 32 r2 0 83 43 9 mm rmse 87 4 mm 2 67 ef 0 55 the model performance declined for rainfed treatments as evident from larger rmses and lower ef values as compared with irrigated treatments only the simulated asw for tp p2 treatment could be considered acceptable as compared with the rest of the treatments in 2011 in 2012 the model performance improved as compared with 2011 as indicated by r2 values ranging from 0 40 to 0 96 rmses varying from 23 to 52 mm and ef ranging from 0 59 to 0 88 in general the model performance was acceptable for irrigated treatments including fpp2 spp1 spp2 and tpp3 and rainfed treatments including fpp1 spp1 tpp1 tpp2 and tpp3 also the model tends to overestimate asw during late season in some of the treatments including irrigated treatments tpp2 and tpp3 and rainfed treatments fpp1 spp1 and tpp1 overall the model was unable to accurately simulate the mid season asw in all treatments during both 2011 and 2012 growing seasons and the trend of underestimation of simulated asw was prevalent in most of the treatments and underestimation in few of them during late season similarly nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 reported that model performance for asw was low as indicated by large rmse and ef values close to zero farahani et al 2009 reported that the simulation errors in asw were non uniformly distributed throughout the soil profile with a tendency of overestimation in topsoil and underestimation in deeper soil layers the poor estimates of asw can also be caused by inaccuracy in estimation of transpiration and evaporation pertaining to use of low or less precise transpiration and evaporation coefficients paredes et al 2014 reported that aquacrop tends to overestimate transpiration and underestimate evaporation resulting in bias in asw simulations they recommended that the proportionality between transpiration crop coefficient and cc curve should be revised since the cc curve is not impacted by water stress throughout the season but only during the vegetative stage which is not the case with crop coefficient 3 3 crop evapotranspiration accurate simulation of etc is critical to prove the model applicability for irrigation aid and water management under different conditions especially in conditions of water stress the comparisons between simulated and field measured etc for all treatments are presented in figs 10 and 11 and table 4 in general a t test comparison of the measured and simulated etc values was not significant p 0 05 for both years however detailed results of the model simulations are presented here when using default parameters overall the model estimates of etc were unacceptable due to very low r2 of 0 25 very high rmse of 48 mm very low ef of 0 05 and high prediction error ranging from 0 4 to 33 except for few treatments the crm value of 0 007 in 2011 and 0 083 in 2012 indicated that the model slightly overestimated seasonal etc and the trend of over prediction was more pronounced in drier 2012 growing season paredes et al 2014 reported underestimation of etc when default parameters were used but they obtained higher ef values in the range of 0 47 to 0 87 and low rmses in range of 5 to 9 7 mm they also mentioned that the model performance was decreased in case of water stressed experiments in 2011 field measured etc ranged from 479 mm for rainfed spp3 treatment to 563 mm for irrigated tpp2 with seasonal average of 516 mm during model simulations etc ranged from 475 mm for rainfed tpp1 tpp2 and tpp3 treatments to 550 mm for irrigated fpp3 treatment with overall prediction error in the range of 1 3 6 5 mm to 8 6 47 mm and 11 out of 18 cases had pe 5 except for tpp2 that had a value of 14 8 84 mm in general the positive crm value of 0 024 indicated the tendency of model to under predict etc for 2011 growing season this trend of underestimation of etc was consistently observed for sp and tp under both rainfed and irrigated conditions however for fp the simulated values were higher than the measured values the range of prediction error reported in this study is similar to the range of 1 3 to 8 4 reported by heng et al 2009 and 0 9 to 8 2 reported by raja et al 2018 but less than the range of 5 to 37 for maize grown in mediterranean region under different levels of plant water stress reported by katerji et al 2013 and 6 5 to 22 2 in tropical environment under deficit irrigation management as reported by greaves and wang 2016 although the prediction error in this study was lower than some of the above mentioned literature the etc showed overall high rmse value of 31 mm very low r2 of 0 003 and very low ef of 1 93 indicating that model estimates of seasonal etc as compared to field measured values were very poor for 2011 growing season these results were comparable to those shown by araya et al 2017 for a semi arid climate in which they reported r2 of 0 42 and high normalized rmse of 13 8 indicating low model performance for etc simulations contrarily ran et al 2017 and oiganji et al 2016 evaluated the performance of the aquacrop model in simulation of etc and found close agreement between measured and simulated values in general the model predicted etc fairly well for first and second planting under all ppds with prediction error less than or equal to 5 raja et al 2018 studied the model performance for maize ppd of 83 333 pph under three different planting dates of 28 april 10 may and 25 may and reported that prediction error of measured and simulated etc was in the range of 0 88 to 8 18 with overall rmse value of 17 mm and r2 of 0 71 indicating acceptable model accuracy they mentioned that the results demonstrated moderately insufficient accuracy with delayed planting dates in the initial growth stages and suggested adjustment in soil evaporation coefficient ke especially in the initial growth stages to improve model performance in drier 2012 the field measured etc was lower than those observed in 2011 ranging from 355 mm for rainfed spp2 to 577 mm for irrigated fpp3 with seasonal average of 465 mm the pooled data indicated greater increase of etc by 26 mm for every 10 day delay in planting date irmak and djaman 2016 however during simulation etc ranged from 415 mm for tpp3 similar etc of 417 for tpp1 and tpp2 to 510 mm for irrigated fpp3 similar to the results of 2011 the aquacrop model underestimated etc in 2012 as indicated by the positive crm value of 0 019 but with much higher prediction error in the range of 1 4 7 mm to 18 64 mm generally the model simulations of etc for second and third planting under irrigated conditions and third planting under rainfed conditions for all ppds performed best among all treatments the model statistics indicated r2 of 0 61 rmse of 38 4 mm and ef value of 0 50 for 2012 araya et al 2017 also obtained similar rmse values in the range of 7 to 18 for maize in a semi arid environment in kansas similarly greaves and wang 2016 reported rmse values in the range of 9 5 to 18 4 for two out of three experiments conducted in taiwan in 2012 for all treatments the model exhibited very poor to moderate accuracy in simulation of etc as indicated by r2 of 0 61 rmse of 38 mm and ef of 0 54 these results indicated that model performance for etc was better for drier 2012 as compared with 2011 growing season although some values of rmses in 2012 were much greater than 2011 table 3 therefore the model performance did not decline for the water stress environments in this study conditions as opposed to the common conclusion of decrease in model accuracy with increase in water stress as reported by greaves and wang 2016 in both years the model simulated and field measured etc values differed as much as 47 to 64 mm this is a high prediction error range in model simulations especially when considering the model application in water limiting conditions and in areas that have water allocation in which even a small amount of under or over estimation can cause substantial challenges for growers managers and other agricultural and water management professionals and decision makers one of the causes of errors in simulated etc is the model incompetency in simulation of asw precise simulation of asw or soil water content in the root zone is an indication of good estimation of etc in the soil water balance component of the aquacrop model geerts et al 2009 as discussed in the previous section the model performance in terms of simulation of asw was unacceptable such that the model severely underestimated the asw in most cases this could have resulted in underestimation of etc values simulated by the model our results are similar to those reported in some other studies mentioning underestimation of etc by the model ran et al 2017 greaves and wang 2016 oiganji et al 2016 and katerji et al 2013 katerji et al 2013 reported that the model systematically underestimates seasonal etc and concluded that the low deviation between simulated and measured seasonal etc indicated that the periods during which model overestimated daily etc were balanced by the periods when the model underestimated daily etc heng et al 2009 validated the model for daily etc calculations and found that the model predicted very high etc peaks at the start of irrigation treatments due to high values of air temperature and wind speed input data perhaps it might be possible that the model over predicts etc values under conditions of high evaporative demands paredes et al 2014 also tested aquacrop for seasonal etc and reported that aquacrop was able to simulate etc with acceptable accuracy 0 74 r2 0 89 5 1 mm rmse 6 7 mm 0 70 ef 0 87 and no trends of over or under estimation of etc were detected the discrepancies between simulated and measured etc values can also be attributed to larger dependency of transpiration crop coefficient kctr on cc curve due to which impact of water stress on transpiration is minimized suggesting the need to revise kctr and cc curve proportionality paredes et al 2014 katerji et al 2013 differently ran et al 2017 supported the etc calculation approach based on cc utilized in the aquacrop model and concluded that the etc values simulated by the model were very close to the field measured values therefore there is a need of more detailed examination of etc and its partitioning to evaporation and transpiration to determine the true reasons for such inconsistency in addition greaves and wang 2016 highlighted that the bias between simulated and measured etc values might result from excessive drainage simulated by the model and spatial variability of the soil in the field 3 4 grain yield the results of model performance pertaining to grain yield are presented in figs 12 and 13 and goodness of fit parameters are presented in table 3 model simulations with default parameters and variables showed that model was inadequate in predicting grain yield during both years rmse 1 8 ton ha 1 and ef 0 41 which evidence the necessity of using appropriately calibrated crop parameters aquacrop model predictions for grain yield satisfactorily agreed with the measured data when calibrated parameters were used which is indicated by strong r2 of 0 86 rmse of 0 97 ton ha 1 and ef of 0 83 for all yield pooled data the rmses of grain yield simulation during 2011 and 2012 under all treatments pooled data were 0 48 and 1 28 ton ha 1 respectively likewise ef values of 0 47 and 0 61 were observed for 2011 and 2012 growing seasons respectively lowest rmses and highest ef values were obtained under irrigated treatments during both years indicating that model performance declined in water stress conditions and this is also evident from higher rmses in drier 2012 growing season these indices of agreement between simulated and measured data were similar to those reported by heng et al 2009 who reported rmses in the range of 0 65 to 1 57 ton ha 1 and ef values varying from 0 47 for rainfed treatment to 0 97 for irrigated treatments concluding that the model was considered unsatisfactory in prediction of maize yield under water stress conditions on a treatment average basis irrigated yields were greater than rainfed yields by 0 33 ton ha 1 in 2011 and by 3 4 ton ha 1 in drier 2012 a t test comparison between simulated and measured grain yields indicated that the model estimates were very close to the field data p 0 05 during both years except for rainfed treatments in 2012 year p 0 05 similarly the simulated yields were tested among different planting dates ppds and irrigation treatments irrespective of irrigation treatments and planting dates the model simulated yields were significantly different p 0 05 between p1 and p2 and p3 and p4 while p2 and p3 were not different in both years p 0 05 when compared among different planting dates significant differences were observed only between sp and tp and fp and tp in 2011 while other treatments did not exhibit any significant differences due to planting dates besides simulated irrigated yields were significantly greater p 0 05 than rainfed yields in both years most of the simulated results were consistent with the field measured data indicating that aquacrop can be employed to differentiate crop yield among varying planting dates ppds and irrigation treatments based on the yield predictions however it is important to note that the model s yield simulation error range rmses ranging from 0 65 to 1 57 ton ha 1 can still be considered high especially in irrigated but low yield productivity areas where 1 57 ton ha 1 can be a significant portion of the final yield produced also when the model is used to predict rainfed yields this performance error can also constitute a high percentage of total yields produced under non irrigation conditions in which yields are usually much lower than irrigated conditions all these important points justify the need for improvement in aquacrop for yield predictions with different planting densities and dates the comparison of measured and simulated rainfed grain yield showed prediction error in the range of 0 4 8 0 in 2011 and 0 1 40 1 in 2012 table 5 the range of prediction error was 0 1 12 1 for irrigated treatments in both years the prediction error for simulated yields was less than 10 for 30 out of total 36 cases in 2011 it was observed that the minimum error 0 4 in grain yield prediction was obtained in irrigated spp2 and rainfed spp3 while the maximum was obtained for fpp1 in both irrigated 6 5 and rainfed treatments 8 in 2012 irrigated fpp1 had minimum error of 0 1 while rainfed spp2 had maximum error of 40 1 similar prediction error statistics for grain yield were reported by abedinpour et al 2012 0 84 16 for semi arid region of northern india araya et al 2017 1 12 in a semi arid climate of kansas hsiao et al 2009 1 23 8 in california heng et al 2009 2 12 4 for texas and katerji et al 2013 4 2 13 3 under contrasting water stress conditions in a mediterranean region the rmses obtained in this study 0 36 rmse 1 61 ton ha 1 were comparable to those reported in the literature for maize grain yield for instance rmses of 0 71 for calibration and 1 77 mg ha 1 for validation under full and deficit irrigation in semi arid climate of iran ahmadi et al 2015 0 65 1 57 ton ha 1 under varying water stress levels for rainy weather and sandy soil in florida heng et al 2009 1 73 ton ha 1 under deficit and full irrigation in a mediterranean climate of portugal paredes et al 2014 and 0 74 1 25 ton ha 1 for rainfed maize in pennsylvania mebane et al 2013 have been reported the ef values reported in this study 0 83 for pooled data 0 47 in 2011 and 0 61 in 2012 and negative values for rainfed treatments were similar to those reported by paredes et al 2014 0 82 for calibration and heng et al 2009 0 47 for rainfed to 0 97 for irrigated but smaller than those reported by abedinpour et al 2012 0 99 for calibration and 0 98 for validation the crm value for grain yield was calculated to determine the model tendency to over or under predict simulated values the crm value for 2011 was 0 01 indicating minimal underestimation of yield while in 2012 the crm value of 0 05 indicated slight overestimation and the pooled data for both years had crm value of 0 01 overall the simulated yields were in line with the measured values the crm value of 0 15 was obtained in rainfed 2012 treatments indicating over prediction of yield was more pronounced in rainfed treatments salemi et al 2011 also reported crm values of 0 02 for biomass yield of silage maize grown in arid region supporting model s tendency to over predict yield in general the results of this study highlighted two major discrepancies in simulation of grain yield first the model is unable to predict grain yield under water stress conditions such as in rainfed treatments second the model tends to overestimate grain yield especially in dry weather conditions this outcome was also justified by several other researchers including katerji et al 2013 and heng et al 2009 and they mentioned that the model s incapability of simulating accelerated senescence of maize canopy under water stress which affected grain yield hsiao et al 2009 discussed that the likely reason for such behavior is that while the simulation of senescence is a complex process the simplification procedure used in aquacrop represents extreme simplification of the reality it should be noted that for a water driven models such as aquacrop yield performance depends on precise simulation of etc and soil water dynamics errors in simulation of evaporation and transpiration might lead to inaccuracy in estimation of yield also the yield overestimation by the model is likely related to this insufficiency in partition of etc into e and t paredes et al 2014 moreover the results of our study indicate that it is very important to use appropriate hi value that can vary for different crop varieties planting densities weather conditions geographical location and other factors for instance in this study hi value of 54 for p2 and p3 from field measurements was used in simulation of yield as opposed to the default value of 48 which significantly improved yield simulations while the default value was used for lowest ppd p1 due to unavailability of hi data nevertheless the pooled data results show moderate to good adequacy of aquacrop model for estimating maize yield except for water stress conditions 3 5 water use efficiency improvement in crop wue aka crop water productivity cwp is critical to improving agricultural productivity under scenarios of limited water resources increasing food demand and climate change estimation of wue through field experiments is not always feasible to test wide range of field management combinations including planting dates and densities irrigation amounts and timings fertilizer applications etc but accurate simulation models can be beneficial to fill these gaps most studies ahmadi et al 2015 ran et al 2017 hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 mebane et al 2013 conducted in past using aquacrop model for maize did not assess its performance for simulation of wue in this study the field measured wue was compared with the model simulated values and the results are presented in figs 14 and 15 while tabulated results and statistical indicators to assess model performance efficiency are presented in tables 6 and 3 the field measured wue ranged from 2 3 to 2 8 kg m 3 in 2011 and from 1 7 to 2 6 kg m 3 in 2012 the simulation results in our study indicated wue in the range of 2 3 to 3 0 kg m 3 in 2011 and 1 9 to 2 6 kg m 3 in 2012 which closely mimicked the range of field data although the range was close the model simulated values indicated bias in model performance for simulating wue when using default r2 0 44 rmse 0 32 kg m 3 ef 0 30 and calibrated parameters r2 0 52 rmse 0 31 kg m 3 ef 0 14 the crm values of 0 07 and 0 11 for 2011 and 2012 growing seasons respectively indicated that model overestimated wue in both seasons during simulation of wue the difference between field measured and model simulated wue data was also assessed on the basis of prediction error which ranged from 1 5 to 23 6 in 2011 and from 1 7 to 32 2 in 2012 the highest error values were more frequent in rainfed treatment in 2012 probably due to high water stress level experienced by the crop the t test performed on pooled data for both years also confirmed that there were significant p 0 05 differences between field measured and simulated wue values however when the treatments were analyzed individually for each year it was observed that model simulated results were close to field data for p1 in both years and p3 in 2012 p 0 05 best simulated results for wue were obtained for fp and sp in 2011 and for sp and tp in 2012 clear trends were absent between irrigated and rainfed treatments in any of the years but 2011 results showed better simulation of wue under rainfed treatments whereas in 2012 model performance was better for irrigated treatments the bias in the etc values simulated by the model in both years could have impacted wue simulations similar to the results in this study abedinpour et al 2012 reported that model prediction error in simulating wue varied from 2 35 to 27 5 for different irrigation and nitrogen levels however they obtained lower rmse of 0 12 kg m 3 and ef in the range of 0 66 to 0 74 indicating acceptable model performance in simulating wue in contrast heng et al 2009 tested aquacrop for simulation of wue and reported smaller deviations in the range of 1 3 to 15 3 and small standard error of 0 17 kg m 3 in texas katerji et al 2013 also reported unsatisfactory performance of the model for wue and mentioned that the model tends to overestimate wue in some treatments and underestimate in others they mentioned that the model overestimated the inhibition of the canopy expansion affecting cc and simulating low etc and finally inhibit yield which consequently affect wue likewise greaves and wang 2016 assessed aquacrop model for simulating maize wue under deficit irrigation conditions in a tropical environment and estimated large wue deviations from measured values in the range of 6 0 to 32 2 due to some significant mismatch between simulated and measured etc they also indicated that the deviations between wue values were not a function of the level of plant water stress as mentioned in some other research reports the large deviation 7 2 to 43 7 and relatively low r2 of 0 43 for regression analysis between simulated and field measured wue was also reported by todorovic and albrizio 2009 in simulating sunflower growth under different water regimes in an effort to explore how different models perform in simulating wue of several crops including cotton maize quinoa and sunflower evett and tolk 2009 concluded that the simulation models estimated wue adequately under well watered conditions but not under conditions of water stress this tendency of model limits its applicability for exploration of deficit irrigation or rainfed scenarios the results of this study and the above discussed literature indicate that the model needs improvements especially for etc calculation that has a substantial impact on wue under both irrigated and water stress conditions 4 conclusions the aquacrop model was tested using extensive field measured data from 2011 and 2012 growing seasons for simulating maize cc asw etc grain yield and wue in nebraska usa several treatment combinations including three planting dates and three ppds were evaluated under rainfed and irrigated conditions cc was simulated satisfactorily in 2011 with rmse and ef in the range of 5 3 to 12 7 and 0 42 to 0 94 respectively except for irrigated spp1 and spp3 treatments however in dry 2012 the model performance declined and higher rmses in range of 11 7 to 24 4 were obtained due to substantial underestimation of cc during mid season and late crop growth stages the asw exhibited opposite trend to cc indicating better model performance in dry year in 2012 0 40 r2 0 96 0 59 ef 0 88 and 23 rmse 52 mm than in 2011 growing season 0 32 r2 0 83 2 67 ef 0 55 and 44 mm rmse 87 mm for most of the treatments a common trend of underestimation of simulated values was observed in both years during mid season and late growth stages and this effect was more pronounced in 2011 the best predictions of asw in 2012 were obtained for ppd of 59 300 pph under all three planting dates and also for third planting date under all three ppds under rainfed conditions indicating better model performance for asw under water stress conditions owing to the underestimation of asw the model simulated etc values were in general lower than the field measured data in both years crm of 0 024 in 2011 and 0 019 in 2012 in 2011 the overall prediction error was in the range of 1 3 6 5 mm to 14 8 44 mm with 11 out of 18 cases having pe 5 with a high rmse value of 31 mm very low r2 of 0 003 and very low ef of 1 93 indicating substantial bias in model estimates in 2012 the model statistics indicated r2 of 0 61 rmse of 38 4 mm and ef value of 0 50 with prediction error in the range of 1 to 18 indicating insufficient accuracy however the simulated etc values were statistically similar p 0 05 to the measured values despite of the aforementioned discrepancies in terms of grain yield predictions the model estimates of yield were satisfactory except for some rainfed yields in both years with pooled data showing r2 rmse crm and ef values of 0 86 0 97 ton ha 1 0 01 and 0 83 ton ha 1 respectively p 0 05 in both years except for rainfed treatments in 2012 p 0 05 overall differences between simulated and measured yield ranged from 0 4 to 8 in 2011 and 0 1 to 40 1 in 2012 it is important to note that the model s yield simulation error range rmses ranging from 0 65 to 1 57 ton ha 1 can still be considered high especially in irrigated but low yield productivity areas where 1 57 ton ha 1 can be a significant portion of the final yield produced also when the model is used to predict rainfed yields this performance error can also constitute a high percentage of total yield produced under non irrigation conditions in which yields are usually much lower than irrigated conditions nevertheless the pooled data results show moderate accuracy of aquacrop model for estimating maize yield except for water stress conditions in which yield simulations were inaccurate the model simulated values indicated bias in model performance for simulating wue when using default r2 0 44 rmse 0 32 kg m 3 ef 0 30 and calibrated parameters r2 0 52 rmse 0 31 kg m 3 ef 0 14 p 0 05 for both years and the crm values were 0 07 and 0 11 for 2011 and 2012 growing seasons respectively indicated that model overestimated wue in both seasons the results indicate that the model requires improvements especially for etc estimations that have a substantial impact on wue overall the aquacrop model should be modified to improve simulation of soil water content which in turn affects other related variables such as etc and wue besides the observed bias in simulated values is most likely due to insufficient parameterization of crop parameters in the later growth stages in the model that is highly impacted by crop senescence stress coefficients moreover it is important to use appropriate hi values to obtain accurate simulation of grain yield therefore incorporation of the above mentioned improvements in the model can make it a reliable tool for studying wide range of crops response to water under various management practices acknowledgements this study is based upon work that is supported by the national institute of food and agriculture u s department of agriculture dr suat irmak s hatch project under the project number neb 21 155 
10886,a well tested crop model can be an important tool in assessment of different crop management scenarios to improve crop yield and water productivity in this study the fao aquacrop model was evaluated for predicting maize zea mays l canopy cover cc available soil water asw grain yield crop evapotranspiration etc and water use efficiency wue when grown at three different planting dates and densities under rainfed and subsurface drip irrigated conditions in nebraska usa the model adequately simulated cc in 2011 with root mean squared error rmse and model efficiency ef in the range of 5 3 to 12 7 and 0 42 to 0 94 respectively while in drier 2012 cc was substantially under predicted with higher rmse of 24 4 asw was consistently underestimated in both years with negative ef value for most treatments in 2011 while in 2012 this trend was more pronounced in irrigated treatments especially during mid season etc estimates were marginal with prediction error of up to 15 in 2011 and 18 in 2012 and overall rmse of 35 mm for both years simulated grain yield was acceptable in 2011 with deviations from measured data up to 8 while in 2012 the deviations were much higher up to 40 for rainfed treatments with overestimations in both years the errors in etc and yield simulations are considered high especially when considering the model application in water limiting or and rainfed conditions and low yielding areas in which these errors can be a substantial portion of the total yields produced and in seasonal total etc from production fields and can cause challenges for growers and decision makers the overestimation of yield and underestimation of etc resulted in overestimation of wue producing inconsistent estimates in both years detailed analyses of model performance and potential reasons for the discrepancies and areas that require improvements in the model are presented keywords model performance available soil water water use efficiency water stress deficit irrigation subsurface drip irrigation 1 introduction sustainable utilization of resources in agriculture and narrowing yield gaps for all crops play a key role in providing sufficient food for rapidly increasing world population tittonell and giller 2013 low and non uniformly distributed rainfall as well as water limitation and crisis scenarios limiting further expansion of irrigation pose a major challenge to improve increase crop production such challenges in agriculture can be addressed through proper agronomic management strategies including effective soil crop and irrigation management appropriate planting population density and planting dates selection of improved hybrids and crop protection to maximize crop productivity these are especially necessary practices to enhance productivity and efficiency of production of major agronomic row crops grown worldwide including maize maize is one of the most important and widely distributed cereal crops in the world accounting for around 1 05 billion metric tons of global production about one third of the global maize production occurs in the u s a making it the largest maize producer in the world nebraska is one of the leading maize cultivation states in the u s a accounting for more than 36 million hectares harvested in 2017 and a total crop production of 42 7 million metric tons united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass 2017 however this productivity is highly influenced by the local crop soil and irrigation management practices and the maize productivity can have significant impact on food supply and demands in addition high growing season and inter annual variability in rainfall amounts and distribution especially in semi arid conditions of nebraska further necessitates the adoption of appropriate crop production techniques to optimize yield maize yield is influenced by several factors such as weather conditions hybrid soil conditions weed pressure diseases nutrient deficiency irrigation and crop management practices crop yield is highly influenced by water availability which is also affected by inter annual variability in rainfall patterns thus requiring timely irrigation practices such variability in rainfall becomes a deciding factor in estimating the appropriate dates of planting to prevent water stress besides in the past few decades availability of improved crop hybrids with higher tolerance to increased planting population densities has improved crop yields consistently duvick 2005 therefore it is important to investigate and determine optimum planting population densities planting dates and irrigation amounts and their interactions to maximize grain yield and crop water productivity plant population density ppd is one of the major factors impacting crop yield and water use increase in ppd usually results in more grain due to early canopy closure that maximizes light interception and decreases soil surface evaporation westgate et al 1997 however when ppd is above certain level the grain yield tends to decline because of limited availability of intercepted radiation nutrients and water under intense interplant competition griesh and yakout 2001 required optimum ppds vary widely from region to region depending on environmental conditions and hybrids for instance higher ppds may be adopted for high rainfall or irrigation conditions while low ppds are usually recommended for rainfed or dryland conditions in the central us corn belt average maize ppd has increased from 30 000 plants per hectare pph in the 1930s to 80 000 plants ha 1 or greater at present duvick et al 2004 this is because of the adaption of newer hybrids to high planting densities and increased stress resistance for higher yield production li et al 2015 studied the impact of ppds ranging from 15 000 to 180 000 pph under no water stress on grain yield and reported that grain yield was significantly impacted by ppd ranges of 47 000 pph 47 000 83 000 pph and 107 000 pph while ppd of 83 000 107 500 pph was grain yield stable range teasdale 1998 reported increase in grain yield when ppd increased from 64 000 to 90 000 pph in one year and linear decline of yield in dry year in maryland cox and cherney 2001 reported similar maize silage yield for ppds of 80 000 to 116 000 pph in aurora new york el hendawy et al 2008 studied maize yield response to three ppds 48 000 pph 71 000 pph and 95 000 pph under three irrigation rates including full irrigation treatment fit 80 of fit and 60 of fit they reported highest grain yield for ppd of 48 000 pph under full irrigation for drip irrigated maize in sandy soil and concluded that yield increased with increasing irrigation rates and decreasing ppd irmak and djaman 2016 reported that there is a certain optimum combination of ppd and planting date to achieve maximum yield that also depends on the climatic conditions in a given year when investigating maize yield response to three ppds 59 300 74 100 and 88 900 pph and three planting dates under subsurface drip irrigation and rainfed conditions in nebraska usa this implies that the planting date is an important management factor affecting maize yield in the context of climate change selection of optimum planting date window based on the onset of the rainy season is critical to improving crop grain yield and productivity the planting dates have been progressing towards earlier dates contributing to the increased maize yield in different usa growing regions bruns and abbas 2006 delayed planting after late april in mid south bruns and abbas 2006 and after june in southeast may result in significant yield reductions and more frequent infestation of pests and diseases swanson and wilhelm 1996 however later planting dates can produce greater yield than earlier planting in dryland conditions planting maize before or after the optimum date was reported to result in reduced leaf area index total dry matter production and grain yield swanson and wilhelm 1996 planting date of high yielding usa maize regions for latitude groups between 25 and 30 30 and 35 35 and 40 40 and 45 and 45 and 50 n was 42 and 88 89 and 106 107 and 118 119 and 128 and 129 and 135 day of year respectively for each latitude range as reported by long et al 2017 thus selection of appropriate planting dates is also one of the important factors to ensure maximum productivity the aforementioned results indicate the necessity of evaluation and determination of local optimal planting dates and densities under rainfed as well as irrigated conditions for maximizing utilization of available resources improve crop yield and productivity however it is not feasible to evaluate combination of large number of crop management options in field conditions for many different regions and environmental conditions due to time finance and resource constraints in this context a well tested calibrated and validated crop model can serve as an important tool to evaluate maize response to the factors influencing yield and water use efficiency in some cases crop models have proven to be useful in simulating some of the crop management scenarios using fewer resources heng et al 2009 concluded that the fao aquacrop model is very useful for the design and evaluation of water management options and for studying the effect of location soil type and sowing date under rainfed and irrigated crop production although numerous crop models of varying complexities have been developed including crop syst stöckle et al 2003 epic cavero et al 2000 ko et al 2009 dssat jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2017 wofost boogaard et al 1998 and stics brisson et al 1998 2002 most of these models are quite demanding sophisticated and require highly detailed input parameters which limit their applicability moreover unavailability of open access source code and lack of proper user support documentation in some cases inhibits the use of model by people other than the model developers in this context a recently developed aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 has been suggested to be a user friendly model that uses relatively small number of input parameters that are explicit and mostly intuitive as compared with other crop models and attempts to balance simplicity accuracy and robustness the model is transparent in formulation well supported with comprehensive documentation for end users and easy to use besides the model performance has been successfully evaluated for several crops including maize hsiao et al 2009 soybean paredes et al 2015 wheat stricevic et al 2011 barley araya et al 2010 and sunflower stricevic et al 2011 however implementation of any model for practical purposes require evaluation calibration and validation using field measurements from different climatic regions under different water management conditions to ensure accuracy and understand potential limitations of the model thus if aquacrop is to be adopted by the end users it must be able to simulate crop yield and yield influencing factors reasonably well which requires site specific and careful testing calibration and validation of model the overall goal of this study was to explore the applicability of aquacrop model in investigating optimum site specific maize management strategies to maximize crop yield and productivity to the best of our knowledge this research is the first and foremost resource to evaluate aquacrop for semi arid conditions of nebraska in the context of model performance relative to different planting densities and dates under varying water management scenarios using data from extensive and carefully conducted multi year field research due to its inter annual variable climatic conditions such as rainfall patterns and amounts air temperatures and evaporative demand nebraska is an ideal research location to test different crop management strategies many crop research experiments have been and are being continuously conducted at south central agricultural laboratory scal near clay center nebraska since 2003 by the senior author s irmak therefore availability of abundant and extensive long term field measured datasets for almost all crop variables under different irrigation methods center pivot subsurface drip and gravity under different crop water and soil tillage management practices are very valuable and unique in regards to comprehensive assessment of model performance at this location this study is unprecedented in its inclusion of all field measured crop parameters including canopy cover total soil water in the root zone agronomic practices irrigation date and amounts crop evapotranspiration grain yield and water use efficiency which in many cases is mostly lacking in other research reports because availability of such extensive datasets on all crop variables is a very challenging task though it is highly important and desirable in modelling approaches this research will provide fair and trustworthy information about model performance relative to each of the above mentioned crop parameter evaluate the extent of the model s applicability for nebraska conditions assess model s performance and potential limitations and provide suggestions for improvements in the model which will enhance the prediction accuracy the hypothesis of this study was that aquacrop can be employed in selecting adaptive crop management practices to improve maize yield and productivity in semi arid conditions of nebraska with sufficient accuracy sandhu and irmak 2019 evaluated the aquacrop model using six years 2005 2010 of field measured maize data in which they suggested that default parameters provide highly inaccurate results and a set of calibrated parameters were developed that improved the model performance as compared with the default parameters after appropriate calibration and validation therefore the specific objective of this study was to investigate the performance of aquacrop model for different management practices relative to three planting densities ranging from low to high and three planting dates from early to late dates under irrigated and rainfed conditions this information will shed light on the extent of applicability of the model for nebraska conditions and aid crop growers researchers policy makers and extension professionals in assessing and reducing risks of crop failure yield loss and achieve maximum profits by adopting appropriate crop and in season water management strategies selected in advance based on modelling 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site and experimental design the extensive field data used in this study were obtained from experiments conducted by the senior author at the university of nebraska lincoln south central agricultural laboratory scal 40 34 n and 98 8 w at an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska during growing seasons of 2011 and 2012 the experiment details and procedures were outlined by irmak and djaman 2016 and are briefly discussed here the research site lies in the transition zone between sub humid and semi arid climate zones with the mean annual precipitation of 731 mm mean annual temperature of 10 3 c and mean annual snowfall of 381 mm u s climate data 2018 significant annual and growing season variability of precipitation in both magnitude and timing requires supplemental irrigation especially for a high water user crops like maize the major soil type at the site is a hastings silt loam which is a well drained upland soil fine montmorillonitic mesic udic argiustoll with particle size distribution of 15 sand 65 silt and 20 clay with 2 5 organic matter content in the topsoil irmak 2010 the soil at the site has field capacity of 0 34 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point of 0 14 m3 m 3 saturation point of 0 53 m3 m 3 saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of 430 mm day 1 and the effective rooting depth of maize at the site is 1 50 m the experiment was laid out in a field covering an area of 13 5 ha and irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation sdi system that was installed in 2004 maize hybrid mycogen 2d770 was planted on three dates may 4 16 and 23 and was harvested on november 3 in the 2011 growing season in 2012 similar maize hybrid mycogen 2v707 was planted on april 24 may 8 and may 17 and was harvested on october 9 besides three planting dates which were referred to as first planting fp second planting sp and third planting tp three plant population densities p of 59 300 74 100 and 88 900 plants per hectare pph referred to as p1 p2 and p3 were evaluated during both growing seasons all treatments were further investigated under irrigated as well as rainfed settings therefore a total of 18 treatments were studied in this experiment using a completely randomized block design with four replications maize was planted at soil depth of 0 05 m in the east west direction with plant row spacing of 0 76 m in both seasons the plots were fertilized uniformly and all herbicide fungicide and insecticides were applied uniformly when needed irmak and djaman 2016 irrigation timing and amounts varied due to differences in ppd and planting dates during both years 2 2 weather trends at research site the weather data including rainfall maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed in both growing seasons were measured using a bowen ratio energy balance system brebs installed in the research field as part of the nebraska water and energy flux measurement modeling and research network nebflux irmak 2010 the overall climate trends during 2011 and 2012 growing seasons for precipitation and grass reference evapotranspiration eto are presented in fig 1 the 2011 growing season received greater amount of precipitation 349 mm than 2012 growing season 285 mm there was a relatively uniform distribution of precipitation events in 2011 throughout the growing season except for few dry periods may was the wettest month with the same precipitation amount of about 120 mm in both years which coincided with early vegetative growth stages of maize indicating that there was enough soil moisture at the start of growing season for emergence and the soil water was uniformly distributed in the experimental field only very small amounts of precipitation were observed during july and august corresponding to water intensive water stress sensitive stages of maize silking and grain filling and these effects were more pronounced in 2012 growing season the maximum air temperatures tmax were greater in 2012 than in 2011 the mean air temperatures tmean during early growth stages in may and june were greater in 2012 by 2 7 and 1 5 c respectively as compared with 2011 similarly vapor pressure deficits were substantially higher in 2012 than 2011 indicating very high atmospheric evaporative demands in 2012 and the mean relative humidity was higher in 2011 than in 2012 2 3 field research data the data collected in the field included weather data leaf area index lai soil water content swc and grain yield and other variables that were derived from field measured data including crop evapotranspiration etc eto and crop water use efficiency wue irmak and djaman 2016 lai was measured every ten days from each treatment for both growing seasons using a leaf canopy analyzer li cor 2200 li cor biosciences lincoln nebraska usa the volumetric soil water content was measured using a model 4302 neutron attenuation probe troxler electronics laboratories inc nc usa at 0 30 0 60 0 90 1 20 1 50 and 1 80 m soil depths twice a week throughout both growing seasons in two replications of each treatment the neutron probe access tubes were installed between two plants in the middle plant row the neutron probe measurements were used for analyzing soil water content dynamics and determine etc using a soil water balance approach seasonal etc was calculated using a general soil water balance approach 1 etc p i u r d δsws where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation water applied mm u is upward soil water flux mm assumed zero because the groundwater depth is approx 33 m below the surface r is run off mm d is deep percolation from the crop root zone mm and δsws change in soil water storage in the soil profile mm from the beginning to the end of the growing season surface run off from each treatment was quantified using the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service curve number method united states department of agriculture soil conservation service usda nrcs 1985 based on the experimental site s hydrologic soil group land use treatment and other condition the curve numbers of 75 was used deep percolation was calculated using a daily water balance computer program as mentioned in djaman and irmak 2012 maize was harvested using a plot combine with an eight row head to measure grain yield per plot and was adjusted to the 15 5 grain moisture content wue was calculated to determine maize water productivity response to treatments using the following equation 2 wue y etc where wue is expressed in kg m 3 on a unit water volume basis and y is grain yield g m 2 2 4 aquacrop model description aquacrop is suggested as a user friendly and practitioner oriented type of model which consists of four sub models 1 the atmosphere sub model consisting of rainfall eto and co2 concentration 2 crop sub model involving crop growth development senescence and yield 3 management sub model that includes irrigation and field management practices 4 soil sub model that handles soil water balance with a daily time step the model simulates successively the four major processes of crop production including crop development transpiration tr above ground biomass production and yield first aquacrop simulates crop growth development and senescence using green canopy cover cc the cc is then used with eto and coefficient for transpiration kctr to calculate transpiration similarly soil evaporation coefficient is used with cc and eto to calculate soil evaporation daily transpiration tri is translated into a proportional amount of daily aboveground biomass produced bi through biomass water productivity of crop normalized for evaporative demand and atmospheric co2 wp as 3 b i w p t r i e t o i the model simulates soil water balance by keeping track of incoming rainfall irrigation and capillary rise and outgoing r etc and d water fluxes at the boundaries of the root zone the effects of water stress on the crop are expressed through four stress response coefficients that are functions of fractional depletion of total available soil water in the crop root zone these coefficients include canopy expansion stomatal conductance canopy senescence and harvest index hi with their own level of sensitivity to water stress crop yield is calculated by multiplying the simulated above ground biomass with the reference hi which is continuously adjusted during yield formation based on its response to water and or temperature stresses additional underlying concepts principles and assumptions of the model are described in detail by steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 and hsiao et al 2009 2 5 aquacrop input data and calibration aquacrop model tends to maintain balance between accuracy simplicity and robustness that uses a moderate number of input parameters these input parameters are specified in climate crop soil and management files and can be modified by the user these are separated into two distinct categories 1 conservative parameters that do not change with time management practices or location and are provided as default values in the model 2 non conservative parameters also known as user cultivar specific parameters that can vary from year to year with location or between various crop varieties and should be observed in the field or provided by the user the conservative parameters include canopy growth cgc and canopy decline coefficient cdc crop coefficient for transpiration tr normalized water productivity wp soil water depletion thresholds for the inhibition leaf growth stomatal conductance and acceleration of canopy senescence reference harvest index hio and coefficients for adjusting harvest index hi in relation to inhibition of leaf growth and of stomatal conductance besides conservative parameters the user specific information include weather and soil information plant density and irrigation as well as the specifics of the selected crop cultivar the climate data required by the model consists of five daily weather input variables minimum and maximum air temperatures eto precipitation and the mean annual co2 concentration in the atmosphere in this study the first four weather variables for 2011 and 2012 were obtained from the brebs flux tower that was installed in the experimental field as discussed earlier the co2 concentration is the annual mean value that was measured by the mauna loa observatory in hawaii and the model has inbuilt files for past and current co2 concentration values while the user can enter future year s co2 values in the model the values for non conservative parameters in the crop tab such as plant density time of sowing maximum root depth etc were obtained from irmak and djaman 2016 based on the field measurements while the values for conservative parameters were obtained from sandhu and irmak 2019 that were calibrated using extensive field datasets from irmak 2015a b for maize growing season of 2009 and validated for 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 growing seasons extensive calibration procedures were applied to have a robust and fair calibration of the model to obtain justifiable validations it should be noted that in most cases it is neither necessary nor possible to measure all input parameters variables in the field continuously to calibrate and or validate the model however the performance of the model in terms of simulating some of the critical singular processes i e transpiration can be assessed though modularity structure of the model by simulating the parameters variables that strongly influence those critical processes i e transpiration for example in this study the performance of aquacrop model in simulating transpiration was assessed in terms of model s performance in estimating cc development and biomass production the calibration procedure used in sandhu and irmak 2019 was performed using the guidelines outlined in the aquacrop reference manual and fao irrigation and drainage paper no 66 crop yield response to water steduto et al 2012 and is briefly discussed here the crop phenology is primarily guided by the type of cultivar and air temperature raes et al 2009 therefore growing degree day gdd mode was used to run the model and crop stage lengths were adjusted based on field observations the aquacrop windows version 6 0 was used and field measured data of 2009 growing season was used for calibration first the canopy cover cc curve parameters were quantified iteratively using trial and error approach until the simulated values were close to the field observed values the crop growth stages including time to emergence maximum cc start of canopy senescence and maturity were adjusted based on field measured data next the calibration of parameters affecting soil water dynamics was performed followed by calibration of biomass and yield by adjusting the water productivity and the transpiration crop coefficient then the final yield was simulated by adjustment of harvest index to match with measured yields the calibrated parameters obtained by sandhu and irmak 2019 as well as the model default parameters were used in this study to test the performance of model under different planting densities and dates under both rainfed and irrigated conditions during 2011 and 2012 growing seasons the calibrated model by sandhu and irmak 2019 indicated good agreement between simulated and field measured cc r2 0 86 ef 0 83 and nrmse 7 3 soil water content in the root zone r2 0 88 ef 0 61 and nrmse 5 2 crop evapotranspiration r2 0 97 ef 0 80 and nrmse 3 2 and final grain yield r2 0 99 ef 0 80 and nrmse 7 7 the nrmse indicates the normalized root mean square error values the model performance varied during validation from year to year such that the performance declined in conditions of very high water stress dry 2005 2006 years but was acceptable during normal years having precipitation close to long term average the present study is continuation of model validation and evaluation for different planting densities and dates under both irrigated and rainfed conditions the other input data for the model included management parameters such as field and irrigation information soil data including field capacity permanent wilting point saturation point and saturated hydraulic conductivity and groundwater table depth that were obtained from the field measurements irmak and djaman 2016 in 2011 and 2012 growing seasons the soil properties such as curve number and saturated hydraulic conductivity were further fine tuned during calibration and determined iteratively against field measured soil water content and etc by sandhu and irmak 2019 similarly stress factors affecting canopy expansion stomatal closure and crop senescence were adjusted to obtain close match between simulated and observed values under conditions of no water stress as well as under rainfed conditions the hi value was adjusted for different planting densities in this study some studies have reported that hi increases with increase in ppd and decreases after the optimal ppd is reached delougherty and crookston 1979 rahmati 2009 therefore adopting same value of hi for all ppds might lead to error s in estimation of crop yield in this study default hi value of 48 was used for lowest ppd of 59 300 pph p1 for p2 and p3 hi of 54 was adopted based on the value reported by djaman et al 2013 input data for simulation tabs included simulation period initial conditions and field data information simulation period was based on the planting and harvesting dates of the crop in each year for initial conditions the soil profile was considered to be near soil field capacity one of the reasons for this assumption is that there is an ample rainfall and snow event before the start of maize growing season in the experimental region that usually recharges the soil water to near field capacity however to confirm this assumption the simulations started from the day of high rainfall event and continued towards the maize planting date in each year that resulted in soil water content to be at or very close to field capacity the measured soil water content throughout each growing season was converted to available soil water asw to be inputted into the field data tab the field measured lai was used to estimate green canopy cover following the procedure outlined in hsiao et al 2009 2 6 model evaluation as discussed earlier the model calibration parameters already suggested by sandhu and irmak 2019 were used to run the model and are presented in table 1 the model was evaluated for 2011 and 2012 growing season for its performance in simulating cc asw yield etc and wue under different planting dates and ppds the output of aquacrop model in comparison with the field measurements was assessed using both qualitative and quantitative approaches where the qualitative approach included graphical interpretation of results to evaluate the trends in simulated and field measured data and the quantitative approach consisted of using statistical indicators which included prediction simulation error or percent deviation pe of simulations from measured data root mean squared error rmse nash

tendency of model to over or under predict the measurements where positive crm values indicate underestimation and negative values indicate overestimation hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 the paired t test was also conducted for alpha value of 0 05 for statistical comparisons of simulated and field measured variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 canopy cover cc canopy cover cc is a crucial component of water driven aquacrop model and accurate estimation of this variable is essential for the model to produce good acceptable estimates of etc biomass and hence grain yield in this study cc parameters that have been already calibrated by sandhu and irmak 2019 for the same study site were used to simulate the cc progression during 2011 and 2012 growing seasons and the comparisons of resulting cc curves with the measured cc for all treatments are shown in figs 2 5 the goodness of fit indicators relative to cc curves obtained using calibrated parameters are given in table 2 simulation results using default parameters without calibration indicated poor agreement data not shown between measured and simulated cc with high rmse values 11 to 35 in 2011 and 18 to 42 in 2012 and very low ef values that were mostly negative in all treatments except for third planting date in all plant densities in 2011 and second and third planting dates in p2 and p3 plant densities the most common trend of deviations between simulated and observed values was during earlier canopy closure phase and accelerated senescence periods stages with simulated cc resulting in shorter growing season one of the reasons for this disagreement is that maize phenology responds differently under different environmental conditions latitude is a major factor that significantly affects temperature sunshine hours and duration of crop growth such that maize gdds increases with increase in latitudes liu and xie 2013 therefore the canopy growth parameters need to be adjusted considerably for good estimation of cc development because default parameters used in the model were obtained using data measured at davis ca usa which is at much lower latitude than nebraska paredes et al 2014 reported similar results for cc curve when using default parameters indicating tendency for underestimation of observed cc values with high rmses 16 6 and low to medium model efficiency ef ranging from 0 18 to 0 71 on the contrary the model showed better prediction of cc for both growing seasons when calibrated parameters were used although there were small deviations in 2011 the model was able to capture the trend of cc development well under both irrigated and rainfed treatments as indicated by high r2 values 0 66 r2 0 98 good ef 0 42 ef 0 94 and low estimation errors 5 30 rmse 12 70 for most of the treatments under first planting fp there was a good agreement between simulated and measured cc for all planting densities throughout the growing season under both irrigated and rainfed treatments as indicated by good r2 0 66 ef 0 66 and low rmses 8 8 the small deviations between simulated and observed cc especially during mid season stages might be the result of sampling errors under second planting sp the agreement between simulated and observed cc was good except for p1 and p3 that had low ef values of 0 42 and 0 46 and high rmse of 11 7 and 11 2 respectively under irrigated treatments however high r2 0 92 high ef 0 84 and low rmses 7 7 for all other treatments including for both rainfed and irrigated treatments indicated good model performance one of the discrepancies observed was a slight deviation for cc at the start of the growing season 33 days after planting dap where model simulated cc was lower than the observed values which was more profound in p1 and p3 planting densities similarly for third planting tp date simulated cc was lower than observed values until 39 dap moreover at the later growth stages close to 88 dap the model simulated cc was higher than the observed cc values and this trend was consistent in all ppds under both irrigated and rainfed treatments in general r2 0 86 ef 0 54 and rmses 12 7 indicated good model performance in simulation of cc for most of the treatments comparatively in 2012 the model performance declined in terms of cc simulations for all treatments substantial deviations between simulated and measured cc was consistently observed during mid season stage until senescence in all treatments and slight differences existed during early growth stage for fp and sp dates in general cc simulations indicated better performance under irrigated treatments as compared with the rainfed conditions under fp model overestimated cc until 56 dap and substantially underestimated cc development after 64 dap in both rainfed and irrigated treatments as depicted by marginal r2 0 69 low ef 0 47 and high rmses that ranged from 16 4 to 24 4 thus indicating poor model performance relatively for sp the model predictions for canopy development improved with r2 0 81 ef 0 61 and rmses in the range of 14 1 to 18 2 although some of the differences similar to those observed during fp were evident in these treatments as well however for tp the model simulated the canopy progression during early vegetative stages quite precisely as indicated by high r2 0 94 moderate ef 0 53 and rmses in the range of 11 7 to 19 8 but the disparities during mid season and later growth stages were again prevalent in all treatments overall the model substantially underestimated the canopy development during mid season and late season growth stages i e 60 50 and 52 dap for fp sp and tp dates respectively some of the reasons that could contribute towards discrepancies between model simulated and field measured cc data are discussed here first the field data indicated that statistically planting date or density did not have significant effect p 0 05 on lai in any treatment or year irmak and djaman 2016 but in aquacrop all major components including evaporation transpiration biomass soil water and yield are strictly tied to cc curve calculated from lai which could provide misleading results in some cases it was interesting and important to note that the field measured lai in much drier 2012 growing season was substantially greater than that in 2011 while the model simulations indicated opposite this indicates that the field measured results could differ substantially from the model or theoretical expectations second the model simulates green cc instead of lai to describe crop growth and development that is calculated by a relationship developed by hsiao et al 2009 to obtain cc from lai to be used in the model comparisons however some studies have reported that this relationship between lai and cc works when lai 2 m2 m 2 and for higher lai values the model predicts lower cc since cc is the first step in calibration of model it becomes very important that field observed lai is precisely converted to cc through development of accurate and site specific relationship between lai and cc nielsen et al 2012 third previously reported literature has established that the model performance declines in conditions of water stress katerji et al 2013 hsiao et al 2009 sandhu and irmak 2019 the year 2011 was wetter than 2012 with relatively more uniform distribution of precipitation throughout the growing season although both years were drier than the long term average irmak and djaman 2016 and 2012 was one of the driest and hottest years in nebraska s recorded climate history this justifies the better model performance for simulation of cc in 2011 as opposed to 2012 katerji et al 2013 reported that in stressed treatments the model simulated cc did not match observed cc after 60 dap and it systematically underestimated the maximum cc values similar trend was evitable in this current study for the 2012 growing season lastly the differences in cc can also be partially attributed to the sampling and measurement errors in lai as discussed earlier and or to the increased variation in lai in the field due to impact of extreme hot and dry conditions the rmse values obtained in this study for 2011 were similar to those reported by hsiao et al 2009 with low rmse values ranging from 4 8 to 13 6 while the rmses for 2012 were comparatively higher heng et al 2009 reported larger rmses for rainfed maize in the range of 7 2 to 34 5 that are similar or larger than those obtained in this current study for drier 2012 growing season ef values obtained in the present study were close to or smaller than those reported by heng et al 2009 that were in the range of 0 81 to 0 99 for irrigated treatments and 2 01 for rainfed treatments these results clearly exhibit the importance of careful and precise calibration of cc curve parameters to obtain accurate acceptable simulation results 3 2 available soil water asw the neutron probe measured asw in the maize root zone along with the simulated asw from aquacrop is presented in figs 6 9 when using calibrated parameters when default parameters were used the model simulated asw with very low accuracy as indicated by high rmses ranging from 43 4 to 108 mm in 2011 and from 21 to 84 mm in 2012 as well as very low ef values in the range of 4 36 to 0 38 in 2011 and 3 06 to 0 92 in 2012 table 2 only 3 treatments fpp1 spp1 and tpp1 under rainfed conditions were simulated accurately out of a total of 36 cases inclusive of both 2011 and 2012 treatments paredes et al 2014 also reported very low model performance in simulating asw when using default parameters they reported rmse values ranging from 16 to 36 mm that are similar to or lower than those obtained in this study and negative ef values ranging from 8 4 to 0 0 that are similar to the findings in this study these results indicate the need for additional adjustments in model parameters and thus the necessity of carefully calibrated parameters using measured soil water data field observations showed that treatments affected soil water uptake in both seasons and soil water depletion was higher in magnitude in 2012 as compared with 2011 due to drier conditions irmak and djaman 2016 they reported that the maximum soil water depletion occurred in the topsoil layer 0 0 30 m and minimum occurred in the deepest layers however there was decreasing trend in the soil water uptake in that layer suggesting water uptake also occurred in deeper layers the decreasing trend in soil water towards the later growing season was captured quite well by the aquacrop model as well it was observed that the model tends to simulate the soil water depletion trend well in a number of treatments but not the magnitude moreover higher soil water depletion in drier 2012 was also captured well by the model as observed in the rainfed treatments soil water data in 2012 however in most of the treatments a clear and consistent trend of underestimation of asw was evident in both years especially in the middle part of the growing season and overestimation mostly in the late season in some of the treatments in 2012 the reason for underestimation could be related to underestimation of cc as discussed in the previous section leading to inaccurate partitioning between transpiration and evaporation by the model such that the model might be simulating smaller transpiration and higher evaporative losses this indicates that despite adopting a careful parameterization and calibration the aquacrop model did not simulate asw properly hsiao et al 2009 reported that the model simulated decline in asw less than the measured values resulting in overestimation of asw by a significant amount about 80 mm for maize grown in california davis usa the goodness of fit between measured and simulated soil water data indicators presented in table 2 show that the model performance was not satisfactory in 2011 0 32 r2 0 83 43 9 mm rmse 87 4 mm 2 67 ef 0 55 the model performance declined for rainfed treatments as evident from larger rmses and lower ef values as compared with irrigated treatments only the simulated asw for tp p2 treatment could be considered acceptable as compared with the rest of the treatments in 2011 in 2012 the model performance improved as compared with 2011 as indicated by r2 values ranging from 0 40 to 0 96 rmses varying from 23 to 52 mm and ef ranging from 0 59 to 0 88 in general the model performance was acceptable for irrigated treatments including fpp2 spp1 spp2 and tpp3 and rainfed treatments including fpp1 spp1 tpp1 tpp2 and tpp3 also the model tends to overestimate asw during late season in some of the treatments including irrigated treatments tpp2 and tpp3 and rainfed treatments fpp1 spp1 and tpp1 overall the model was unable to accurately simulate the mid season asw in all treatments during both 2011 and 2012 growing seasons and the trend of underestimation of simulated asw was prevalent in most of the treatments and underestimation in few of them during late season similarly nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 reported that model performance for asw was low as indicated by large rmse and ef values close to zero farahani et al 2009 reported that the simulation errors in asw were non uniformly distributed throughout the soil profile with a tendency of overestimation in topsoil and underestimation in deeper soil layers the poor estimates of asw can also be caused by inaccuracy in estimation of transpiration and evaporation pertaining to use of low or less precise transpiration and evaporation coefficients paredes et al 2014 reported that aquacrop tends to overestimate transpiration and underestimate evaporation resulting in bias in asw simulations they recommended that the proportionality between transpiration crop coefficient and cc curve should be revised since the cc curve is not impacted by water stress throughout the season but only during the vegetative stage which is not the case with crop coefficient 3 3 crop evapotranspiration accurate simulation of etc is critical to prove the model applicability for irrigation aid and water management under different conditions especially in conditions of water stress the comparisons between simulated and field measured etc for all treatments are presented in figs 10 and 11 and table 4 in general a t test comparison of the measured and simulated etc values was not significant p 0 05 for both years however detailed results of the model simulations are presented here when using default parameters overall the model estimates of etc were unacceptable due to very low r2 of 0 25 very high rmse of 48 mm very low ef of 0 05 and high prediction error ranging from 0 4 to 33 except for few treatments the crm value of 0 007 in 2011 and 0 083 in 2012 indicated that the model slightly overestimated seasonal etc and the trend of over prediction was more pronounced in drier 2012 growing season paredes et al 2014 reported underestimation of etc when default parameters were used but they obtained higher ef values in the range of 0 47 to 0 87 and low rmses in range of 5 to 9 7 mm they also mentioned that the model performance was decreased in case of water stressed experiments in 2011 field measured etc ranged from 479 mm for rainfed spp3 treatment to 563 mm for irrigated tpp2 with seasonal average of 516 mm during model simulations etc ranged from 475 mm for rainfed tpp1 tpp2 and tpp3 treatments to 550 mm for irrigated fpp3 treatment with overall prediction error in the range of 1 3 6 5 mm to 8 6 47 mm and 11 out of 18 cases had pe 5 except for tpp2 that had a value of 14 8 84 mm in general the positive crm value of 0 024 indicated the tendency of model to under predict etc for 2011 growing season this trend of underestimation of etc was consistently observed for sp and tp under both rainfed and irrigated conditions however for fp the simulated values were higher than the measured values the range of prediction error reported in this study is similar to the range of 1 3 to 8 4 reported by heng et al 2009 and 0 9 to 8 2 reported by raja et al 2018 but less than the range of 5 to 37 for maize grown in mediterranean region under different levels of plant water stress reported by katerji et al 2013 and 6 5 to 22 2 in tropical environment under deficit irrigation management as reported by greaves and wang 2016 although the prediction error in this study was lower than some of the above mentioned literature the etc showed overall high rmse value of 31 mm very low r2 of 0 003 and very low ef of 1 93 indicating that model estimates of seasonal etc as compared to field measured values were very poor for 2011 growing season these results were comparable to those shown by araya et al 2017 for a semi arid climate in which they reported r2 of 0 42 and high normalized rmse of 13 8 indicating low model performance for etc simulations contrarily ran et al 2017 and oiganji et al 2016 evaluated the performance of the aquacrop model in simulation of etc and found close agreement between measured and simulated values in general the model predicted etc fairly well for first and second planting under all ppds with prediction error less than or equal to 5 raja et al 2018 studied the model performance for maize ppd of 83 333 pph under three different planting dates of 28 april 10 may and 25 may and reported that prediction error of measured and simulated etc was in the range of 0 88 to 8 18 with overall rmse value of 17 mm and r2 of 0 71 indicating acceptable model accuracy they mentioned that the results demonstrated moderately insufficient accuracy with delayed planting dates in the initial growth stages and suggested adjustment in soil evaporation coefficient ke especially in the initial growth stages to improve model performance in drier 2012 the field measured etc was lower than those observed in 2011 ranging from 355 mm for rainfed spp2 to 577 mm for irrigated fpp3 with seasonal average of 465 mm the pooled data indicated greater increase of etc by 26 mm for every 10 day delay in planting date irmak and djaman 2016 however during simulation etc ranged from 415 mm for tpp3 similar etc of 417 for tpp1 and tpp2 to 510 mm for irrigated fpp3 similar to the results of 2011 the aquacrop model underestimated etc in 2012 as indicated by the positive crm value of 0 019 but with much higher prediction error in the range of 1 4 7 mm to 18 64 mm generally the model simulations of etc for second and third planting under irrigated conditions and third planting under rainfed conditions for all ppds performed best among all treatments the model statistics indicated r2 of 0 61 rmse of 38 4 mm and ef value of 0 50 for 2012 araya et al 2017 also obtained similar rmse values in the range of 7 to 18 for maize in a semi arid environment in kansas similarly greaves and wang 2016 reported rmse values in the range of 9 5 to 18 4 for two out of three experiments conducted in taiwan in 2012 for all treatments the model exhibited very poor to moderate accuracy in simulation of etc as indicated by r2 of 0 61 rmse of 38 mm and ef of 0 54 these results indicated that model performance for etc was better for drier 2012 as compared with 2011 growing season although some values of rmses in 2012 were much greater than 2011 table 3 therefore the model performance did not decline for the water stress environments in this study conditions as opposed to the common conclusion of decrease in model accuracy with increase in water stress as reported by greaves and wang 2016 in both years the model simulated and field measured etc values differed as much as 47 to 64 mm this is a high prediction error range in model simulations especially when considering the model application in water limiting conditions and in areas that have water allocation in which even a small amount of under or over estimation can cause substantial challenges for growers managers and other agricultural and water management professionals and decision makers one of the causes of errors in simulated etc is the model incompetency in simulation of asw precise simulation of asw or soil water content in the root zone is an indication of good estimation of etc in the soil water balance component of the aquacrop model geerts et al 2009 as discussed in the previous section the model performance in terms of simulation of asw was unacceptable such that the model severely underestimated the asw in most cases this could have resulted in underestimation of etc values simulated by the model our results are similar to those reported in some other studies mentioning underestimation of etc by the model ran et al 2017 greaves and wang 2016 oiganji et al 2016 and katerji et al 2013 katerji et al 2013 reported that the model systematically underestimates seasonal etc and concluded that the low deviation between simulated and measured seasonal etc indicated that the periods during which model overestimated daily etc were balanced by the periods when the model underestimated daily etc heng et al 2009 validated the model for daily etc calculations and found that the model predicted very high etc peaks at the start of irrigation treatments due to high values of air temperature and wind speed input data perhaps it might be possible that the model over predicts etc values under conditions of high evaporative demands paredes et al 2014 also tested aquacrop for seasonal etc and reported that aquacrop was able to simulate etc with acceptable accuracy 0 74 r2 0 89 5 1 mm rmse 6 7 mm 0 70 ef 0 87 and no trends of over or under estimation of etc were detected the discrepancies between simulated and measured etc values can also be attributed to larger dependency of transpiration crop coefficient kctr on cc curve due to which impact of water stress on transpiration is minimized suggesting the need to revise kctr and cc curve proportionality paredes et al 2014 katerji et al 2013 differently ran et al 2017 supported the etc calculation approach based on cc utilized in the aquacrop model and concluded that the etc values simulated by the model were very close to the field measured values therefore there is a need of more detailed examination of etc and its partitioning to evaporation and transpiration to determine the true reasons for such inconsistency in addition greaves and wang 2016 highlighted that the bias between simulated and measured etc values might result from excessive drainage simulated by the model and spatial variability of the soil in the field 3 4 grain yield the results of model performance pertaining to grain yield are presented in figs 12 and 13 and goodness of fit parameters are presented in table 3 model simulations with default parameters and variables showed that model was inadequate in predicting grain yield during both years rmse 1 8 ton ha 1 and ef 0 41 which evidence the necessity of using appropriately calibrated crop parameters aquacrop model predictions for grain yield satisfactorily agreed with the measured data when calibrated parameters were used which is indicated by strong r2 of 0 86 rmse of 0 97 ton ha 1 and ef of 0 83 for all yield pooled data the rmses of grain yield simulation during 2011 and 2012 under all treatments pooled data were 0 48 and 1 28 ton ha 1 respectively likewise ef values of 0 47 and 0 61 were observed for 2011 and 2012 growing seasons respectively lowest rmses and highest ef values were obtained under irrigated treatments during both years indicating that model performance declined in water stress conditions and this is also evident from higher rmses in drier 2012 growing season these indices of agreement between simulated and measured data were similar to those reported by heng et al 2009 who reported rmses in the range of 0 65 to 1 57 ton ha 1 and ef values varying from 0 47 for rainfed treatment to 0 97 for irrigated treatments concluding that the model was considered unsatisfactory in prediction of maize yield under water stress conditions on a treatment average basis irrigated yields were greater than rainfed yields by 0 33 ton ha 1 in 2011 and by 3 4 ton ha 1 in drier 2012 a t test comparison between simulated and measured grain yields indicated that the model estimates were very close to the field data p 0 05 during both years except for rainfed treatments in 2012 year p 0 05 similarly the simulated yields were tested among different planting dates ppds and irrigation treatments irrespective of irrigation treatments and planting dates the model simulated yields were significantly different p 0 05 between p1 and p2 and p3 and p4 while p2 and p3 were not different in both years p 0 05 when compared among different planting dates significant differences were observed only between sp and tp and fp and tp in 2011 while other treatments did not exhibit any significant differences due to planting dates besides simulated irrigated yields were significantly greater p 0 05 than rainfed yields in both years most of the simulated results were consistent with the field measured data indicating that aquacrop can be employed to differentiate crop yield among varying planting dates ppds and irrigation treatments based on the yield predictions however it is important to note that the model s yield simulation error range rmses ranging from 0 65 to 1 57 ton ha 1 can still be considered high especially in irrigated but low yield productivity areas where 1 57 ton ha 1 can be a significant portion of the final yield produced also when the model is used to predict rainfed yields this performance error can also constitute a high percentage of total yields produced under non irrigation conditions in which yields are usually much lower than irrigated conditions all these important points justify the need for improvement in aquacrop for yield predictions with different planting densities and dates the comparison of measured and simulated rainfed grain yield showed prediction error in the range of 0 4 8 0 in 2011 and 0 1 40 1 in 2012 table 5 the range of prediction error was 0 1 12 1 for irrigated treatments in both years the prediction error for simulated yields was less than 10 for 30 out of total 36 cases in 2011 it was observed that the minimum error 0 4 in grain yield prediction was obtained in irrigated spp2 and rainfed spp3 while the maximum was obtained for fpp1 in both irrigated 6 5 and rainfed treatments 8 in 2012 irrigated fpp1 had minimum error of 0 1 while rainfed spp2 had maximum error of 40 1 similar prediction error statistics for grain yield were reported by abedinpour et al 2012 0 84 16 for semi arid region of northern india araya et al 2017 1 12 in a semi arid climate of kansas hsiao et al 2009 1 23 8 in california heng et al 2009 2 12 4 for texas and katerji et al 2013 4 2 13 3 under contrasting water stress conditions in a mediterranean region the rmses obtained in this study 0 36 rmse 1 61 ton ha 1 were comparable to those reported in the literature for maize grain yield for instance rmses of 0 71 for calibration and 1 77 mg ha 1 for validation under full and deficit irrigation in semi arid climate of iran ahmadi et al 2015 0 65 1 57 ton ha 1 under varying water stress levels for rainy weather and sandy soil in florida heng et al 2009 1 73 ton ha 1 under deficit and full irrigation in a mediterranean climate of portugal paredes et al 2014 and 0 74 1 25 ton ha 1 for rainfed maize in pennsylvania mebane et al 2013 have been reported the ef values reported in this study 0 83 for pooled data 0 47 in 2011 and 0 61 in 2012 and negative values for rainfed treatments were similar to those reported by paredes et al 2014 0 82 for calibration and heng et al 2009 0 47 for rainfed to 0 97 for irrigated but smaller than those reported by abedinpour et al 2012 0 99 for calibration and 0 98 for validation the crm value for grain yield was calculated to determine the model tendency to over or under predict simulated values the crm value for 2011 was 0 01 indicating minimal underestimation of yield while in 2012 the crm value of 0 05 indicated slight overestimation and the pooled data for both years had crm value of 0 01 overall the simulated yields were in line with the measured values the crm value of 0 15 was obtained in rainfed 2012 treatments indicating over prediction of yield was more pronounced in rainfed treatments salemi et al 2011 also reported crm values of 0 02 for biomass yield of silage maize grown in arid region supporting model s tendency to over predict yield in general the results of this study highlighted two major discrepancies in simulation of grain yield first the model is unable to predict grain yield under water stress conditions such as in rainfed treatments second the model tends to overestimate grain yield especially in dry weather conditions this outcome was also justified by several other researchers including katerji et al 2013 and heng et al 2009 and they mentioned that the model s incapability of simulating accelerated senescence of maize canopy under water stress which affected grain yield hsiao et al 2009 discussed that the likely reason for such behavior is that while the simulation of senescence is a complex process the simplification procedure used in aquacrop represents extreme simplification of the reality it should be noted that for a water driven models such as aquacrop yield performance depends on precise simulation of etc and soil water dynamics errors in simulation of evaporation and transpiration might lead to inaccuracy in estimation of yield also the yield overestimation by the model is likely related to this insufficiency in partition of etc into e and t paredes et al 2014 moreover the results of our study indicate that it is very important to use appropriate hi value that can vary for different crop varieties planting densities weather conditions geographical location and other factors for instance in this study hi value of 54 for p2 and p3 from field measurements was used in simulation of yield as opposed to the default value of 48 which significantly improved yield simulations while the default value was used for lowest ppd p1 due to unavailability of hi data nevertheless the pooled data results show moderate to good adequacy of aquacrop model for estimating maize yield except for water stress conditions 3 5 water use efficiency improvement in crop wue aka crop water productivity cwp is critical to improving agricultural productivity under scenarios of limited water resources increasing food demand and climate change estimation of wue through field experiments is not always feasible to test wide range of field management combinations including planting dates and densities irrigation amounts and timings fertilizer applications etc but accurate simulation models can be beneficial to fill these gaps most studies ahmadi et al 2015 ran et al 2017 hassanli and ebrahimian 2016 mebane et al 2013 conducted in past using aquacrop model for maize did not assess its performance for simulation of wue in this study the field measured wue was compared with the model simulated values and the results are presented in figs 14 and 15 while tabulated results and statistical indicators to assess model performance efficiency are presented in tables 6 and 3 the field measured wue ranged from 2 3 to 2 8 kg m 3 in 2011 and from 1 7 to 2 6 kg m 3 in 2012 the simulation results in our study indicated wue in the range of 2 3 to 3 0 kg m 3 in 2011 and 1 9 to 2 6 kg m 3 in 2012 which closely mimicked the range of field data although the range was close the model simulated values indicated bias in model performance for simulating wue when using default r2 0 44 rmse 0 32 kg m 3 ef 0 30 and calibrated parameters r2 0 52 rmse 0 31 kg m 3 ef 0 14 the crm values of 0 07 and 0 11 for 2011 and 2012 growing seasons respectively indicated that model overestimated wue in both seasons during simulation of wue the difference between field measured and model simulated wue data was also assessed on the basis of prediction error which ranged from 1 5 to 23 6 in 2011 and from 1 7 to 32 2 in 2012 the highest error values were more frequent in rainfed treatment in 2012 probably due to high water stress level experienced by the crop the t test performed on pooled data for both years also confirmed that there were significant p 0 05 differences between field measured and simulated wue values however when the treatments were analyzed individually for each year it was observed that model simulated results were close to field data for p1 in both years and p3 in 2012 p 0 05 best simulated results for wue were obtained for fp and sp in 2011 and for sp and tp in 2012 clear trends were absent between irrigated and rainfed treatments in any of the years but 2011 results showed better simulation of wue under rainfed treatments whereas in 2012 model performance was better for irrigated treatments the bias in the etc values simulated by the model in both years could have impacted wue simulations similar to the results in this study abedinpour et al 2012 reported that model prediction error in simulating wue varied from 2 35 to 27 5 for different irrigation and nitrogen levels however they obtained lower rmse of 0 12 kg m 3 and ef in the range of 0 66 to 0 74 indicating acceptable model performance in simulating wue in contrast heng et al 2009 tested aquacrop for simulation of wue and reported smaller deviations in the range of 1 3 to 15 3 and small standard error of 0 17 kg m 3 in texas katerji et al 2013 also reported unsatisfactory performance of the model for wue and mentioned that the model tends to overestimate wue in some treatments and underestimate in others they mentioned that the model overestimated the inhibition of the canopy expansion affecting cc and simulating low etc and finally inhibit yield which consequently affect wue likewise greaves and wang 2016 assessed aquacrop model for simulating maize wue under deficit irrigation conditions in a tropical environment and estimated large wue deviations from measured values in the range of 6 0 to 32 2 due to some significant mismatch between simulated and measured etc they also indicated that the deviations between wue values were not a function of the level of plant water stress as mentioned in some other research reports the large deviation 7 2 to 43 7 and relatively low r2 of 0 43 for regression analysis between simulated and field measured wue was also reported by todorovic and albrizio 2009 in simulating sunflower growth under different water regimes in an effort to explore how different models perform in simulating wue of several crops including cotton maize quinoa and sunflower evett and tolk 2009 concluded that the simulation models estimated wue adequately under well watered conditions but not under conditions of water stress this tendency of model limits its applicability for exploration of deficit irrigation or rainfed scenarios the results of this study and the above discussed literature indicate that the model needs improvements especially for etc calculation that has a substantial impact on wue under both irrigated and water stress conditions 4 conclusions the aquacrop model was tested using extensive field measured data from 2011 and 2012 growing seasons for simulating maize cc asw etc grain yield and wue in nebraska usa several treatment combinations including three planting dates and three ppds were evaluated under rainfed and irrigated conditions cc was simulated satisfactorily in 2011 with rmse and ef in the range of 5 3 to 12 7 and 0 42 to 0 94 respectively except for irrigated spp1 and spp3 treatments however in dry 2012 the model performance declined and higher rmses in range of 11 7 to 24 4 were obtained due to substantial underestimation of cc during mid season and late crop growth stages the asw exhibited opposite trend to cc indicating better model performance in dry year in 2012 0 40 r2 0 96 0 59 ef 0 88 and 23 rmse 52 mm than in 2011 growing season 0 32 r2 0 83 2 67 ef 0 55 and 44 mm rmse 87 mm for most of the treatments a common trend of underestimation of simulated values was observed in both years during mid season and late growth stages and this effect was more pronounced in 2011 the best predictions of asw in 2012 were obtained for ppd of 59 300 pph under all three planting dates and also for third planting date under all three ppds under rainfed conditions indicating better model performance for asw under water stress conditions owing to the underestimation of asw the model simulated etc values were in general lower than the field measured data in both years crm of 0 024 in 2011 and 0 019 in 2012 in 2011 the overall prediction error was in the range of 1 3 6 5 mm to 14 8 44 mm with 11 out of 18 cases having pe 5 with a high rmse value of 31 mm very low r2 of 0 003 and very low ef of 1 93 indicating substantial bias in model estimates in 2012 the model statistics indicated r2 of 0 61 rmse of 38 4 mm and ef value of 0 50 with prediction error in the range of 1 to 18 indicating insufficient accuracy however the simulated etc values were statistically similar p 0 05 to the measured values despite of the aforementioned discrepancies in terms of grain yield predictions the model estimates of yield were satisfactory except for some rainfed yields in both years with pooled data showing r2 rmse crm and ef values of 0 86 0 97 ton ha 1 0 01 and 0 83 ton ha 1 respectively p 0 05 in both years except for rainfed treatments in 2012 p 0 05 overall differences between simulated and measured yield ranged from 0 4 to 8 in 2011 and 0 1 to 40 1 in 2012 it is important to note that the model s yield simulation error range rmses ranging from 0 65 to 1 57 ton ha 1 can still be considered high especially in irrigated but low yield productivity areas where 1 57 ton ha 1 can be a significant portion of the final yield produced also when the model is used to predict rainfed yields this performance error can also constitute a high percentage of total yield produced under non irrigation conditions in which yields are usually much lower than irrigated conditions nevertheless the pooled data results show moderate accuracy of aquacrop model for estimating maize yield except for water stress conditions in which yield simulations were inaccurate the model simulated values indicated bias in model performance for simulating wue when using default r2 0 44 rmse 0 32 kg m 3 ef 0 30 and calibrated parameters r2 0 52 rmse 0 31 kg m 3 ef 0 14 p 0 05 for both years and the crm values were 0 07 and 0 11 for 2011 and 2012 growing seasons respectively indicated that model overestimated wue in both seasons the results indicate that the model requires improvements especially for etc estimations that have a substantial impact on wue overall the aquacrop model should be modified to improve simulation of soil water content which in turn affects other related variables such as etc and wue besides the observed bias in simulated values is most likely due to insufficient parameterization of crop parameters in the later growth stages in the model that is highly impacted by crop senescence stress coefficients moreover it is important to use appropriate hi values to obtain accurate simulation of grain yield therefore incorporation of the above mentioned improvements in the model can make it a reliable tool for studying wide range of crops response to water under various management practices acknowledgements this study is based upon work that is supported by the national

10887,the use of heavy mobile machinery in agriculture for tillage and harvesting is now indispensable since it facilitates farming over large areas however one of the impacts of regular and prolonged use of heavy mobile machinery is soil compaction to help minimize this harmful effect trafficability of agricultural fields needs to be determined soil moisture acts as one of the dominant controls for field trafficability therefore satellites such as sentinel 1 which is one source of spatio temporal soil moisture information could be useful in assessing trafficable conditions one limitation of satellite derived soil moisture is that only the upper surface layer is mapped in this study we determined the feasibility of sentinel 1 surface soil moisture to monitor trafficability over 2016 2017 we first determined coupled conditions when surface soil moisture is a good indicator for values at the subsurface we applied a probabilistic approach to determine trafficability using extensive in situ measurements of penetration resistance and surface soil moisture over a variety of crops trafficability is expressed as the probability that penetration resistance will exceed a threshold for a given soil moisture value furthermore we investigated the variability encountered from these measurements to gain insights on other temporal controls our results show coupled conditions for soil moisture 0 19 cm3 cm 3 and there is an almost 1 1 correspondence between surface and subsurface values for decoupled conditions values at the subsurface can be two times more than the surface an increase in penetration resistance variability coincided with the maturity of crops for cultivated fields aside from soil moisture root growth may have a significant impact on the temporal variability of soil s penetration resistance the status of trafficability can be monitored through the high temporal resolution of sentinel 1 however aggregation to coarser resolutions maybe necessary as its original 10 m resolution may be suboptimal based on validation against in situ measurements days favorable for traffic were observed in early spring this information can aid farmers in the timing of tillage activities or for water managers in deciding to adjust water levels to meet agricultural demands keywords agriculture soil moisture trafficability decoupling sentinel 1 kernel density estimation 1 introduction modern agriculture relies on heavy mobile machinery to carry out farming operations such as tillage and harvesting mechanization increases productivity and enables farming activities to be carried out over larger areas this is driven both by the high demand for food production as well as economic factors to make agriculture profitable however one of the negative impacts of using heavy machinery is soil compaction lal 1991 raghavan et al 1990 hamza and anderson 2005 fao 2015 as a form of land degradation soil compaction leads to structural damages to soil baumgartl and horn 1991 eckelmann et al 2006 destruction of soil structure also leads to poor infiltration van dijck and van asch 2002 which in turn leads to water logging run off and erosion ekwue and harrilal 2010 compaction can have negative consequences for crop root growth and soil ecosystems the use of heavy machinery in agriculture is indispensable so a balance in the timing of farming operations and susceptibility of soils to compaction must be achieved in order to minimize the harmful and long term effects a way to minimize the exposure to the negative impacts of using heavy machinery is to determine trafficable conditions for the soil assessment of agricultural field trafficability as well as the operating machinery during periods suitable for traffic can help slow down the rate at which soils are being compacted so that the use of heavy machinery can be sustainable in the long term trafficability is defined by campbell and o sullivan 1991 as the ability of soil to 1 provide adequate traction for vehicles and 2 withstand traffic without excess compaction or structural damage this is an extension to earlier studies for military purposes which were only concerned with vehicle mobility knight and freitag 1961 more recent studies on field trafficability focus on soil vehicle interaction to quantify the amount of soil compaction with different vehicle specifications keller and lamandé 2010 nawaz et al 2013 rücknagel et al 2015 two sets of factors determine whether soils are able to support the weight of overlying machinery without increased risk for compaction on the one hand are soil physical characteristics that dictate the mechanical strength of the soil these include texture and bulk density of the soil müller et al 2011 for soil texture the strength of aggregated soils increases as clay content increases texture wise soils with higher bulk density at the onset of field traffic can withstand higher pressures before undergoing deformation both soil texture and bulk density do not change significantly over short time scales weeks or months but they are important controls over the spatial patterns of trafficability on the other hand are external factors that affect the grain to grain contact of individual soil particles perhaps the most important of these factors is soil moisture for any given texture or bulk density soil strength decreases towards wetter soil moisture conditions therefore soils become more prone to compaction with increasing soil moisture the amount of overlying pressure that soils can accommodate decreases with increasing soil moisture since the grain to grain contact disappears as water fills up the pore space spatio temporal soil moisture variability is influenced by atmospheric conditions seneviratne et al 2010 soil properties rawls et al 1991 and vegetation hupet and vanclooster 2002 soil moisture exerts significant temporal control over soil strength as it varies greatly over short time scales because of changes in the prevailing atmospheric conditions other factors that control compaction are the set of vehicle specifications that determine the impacts of overlying machinery to the soil soil vehicle interaction studies focus on the influence of tire inflation pressure wheel and axle load on soil deformation müller et al 2011 the mechanical strength of the soil can be determined using cone penetrometers kuang et al 2012 upadhyaya 2005 these are widely used instruments for determining soil s penetration resistance which is equivalent to the force per unit base area required to push the cone penetrometer through a specified increment of soil depth bengough et al 2000 asae ep542 1999 they also have the advantage of providing relatively quick and easy measurements in the field cone penetrometer measurements are also referred to as cone index ci existing field trafficability models have related soil moisture with ci using a decreasing exponential function e g henderson et al 1988 ayers and perumpral 1982 sojka et al 2001 vaz et al 2001 with an increasing ci trend towards drier soil moisture conditions several studies are geared towards monitoring and identifying conditions when the ground is less susceptible to compaction for instance earl 1997 and droogers et al 1996 related trafficability and workability to soil hydraulic parameters to determine the number of workable days for a field other studies investigated the spatial variability of soil moisture and ci which can assist farmers in avoiding less trafficable areas within an agricultural field carrara et al 2007 ferrero et al 2005 these studies have shown the impacts of soil moisture on field trafficability trafficability determined from soil moisture would be beneficial for agriculture but this has been hampered in the past by the lack of continuous and available soil moisture data datasets from satellites are potential sources of regular and or frequent soil moisture information that also cover a considerable spatial extent in the last few years developments in mapping soil moisture using microwave remote sensing have been reported with increasing spatial and temporal resolutions and accuracy kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 vereecken et al 2014 techniques using microwave remote sensing are divided into active and passive methods passive microwave remote sensing measures the intensity of microwave emissions from the earth s surface expressed in terms of brightness temperatures these measurements are performed with microwave radiometers active microwave remote sensing supply their own source of illumination active microwave sensors transmit signals towards a target and measures the portion scattered back synthetic aperture radar sar is an active microwave sensing technique providing observations with a higher spatial resolution sar backscatter signals depend on the technical configuration of the sensor as well as the geometric and dielectric properties of objects on earth for soils dielectric properties are highly influenced by its moisture content cihlar and ulaby 1974 sentinel 1 satellites which carry a sar instrument are promising sources of soil moisture information that would be suitable for mapping and monitoring field trafficability at field scale its revisit time can be up to 2 4 days for certain areas in europe torres et al 2012 which makes it highly suitable for monitoring changes in soil moisture the acquired images are also freely and operationally available sentinel 1 measurements are only sensitive to soil moisture in the upper surface layer 5 cm however assessment of trafficability requires soil moisture values over the topsoil or critical layer droogers et al 1996 earl 1997 priddy and willoughby 2006 reintam et al 2016 although values used in literature vary this corresponds roughly to the upper 20 30 cm of the soil layer this means that surface soil moisture from sentinel 1 needs to be translated into subsurface values before it can be used in certain applications the vertical variability of soil moisture may lead to decoupling between surface and subsurface values capehart and carlson 1997 carranza et al 2018 wherein conditions in the former no longer represents those at the latter this complicates the estimation of depth average soil moisture needed for assessment of trafficability identifying coupled soil moisture conditions would be beneficial as it facilitates the use of satellite derived surface soil moisture to assess field trafficability in this study our main objective is to assess whether sentinel 1 derived surface soil moisture can be used to monitor field trafficability for sentinel 1 several aggregation schemes were tested to determine the optimal pixel size the accuracy of these aggregation schemes were validated against reference in situ measurements from two monitoring networks raam and twente networks given the measurement depth limitations of sentinel 1 we first aim to identify conditions when surface soil moisture values are good indicators of those at subsurface in addition the variability encountered from extensive penetration resistance measurements was analyzed in order to gain further insights on its temporal controls a probabilistic approach is applied to express trafficability based on surface soil moisture and to incorporate variabilities encountered from in situ measurements we demonstrate the results over a small site within the raam catchment as an example to show the potential of sentinel 1 for monitoring agricultural field trafficability 2 study area and datasets 2 1 raam and twente soil moisture networks we utilized several locations within the existing soil moisture monitoring network in twente dente et al 2011 and raam catchment benninga et al 2018 as our study sites these two networks contain stations covering the eastern twente network and southeastern raam network parts of the netherlands fig 1 they were installed previously to serve as validation sites for satellite derived data products each station contains sensors that continuously monitor soil moisture over the soil profile soil moisture and temperature sensors ech2o ec tm or 5tm were installed at discrete depths below the surface 5 10 20 40 and 80 cm measurement loggers store values every 15 min for this study we utilized year long measurements from 2016 2017 in both monitoring networks stations were installed in agricultural areas at the edge or corner of a field to allow continuous measurements installation in the middle of the field was not permitted because of tillage harvesting or grazing of animals from the twente network three out of the 20 stations were utilized from the raam network six out of the 15 stations were utilized as study sites these were chosen to capture the variability in the crops encountered at the study sites during the two year study period the nine agricultural fields for this study were either grass or cultivated fields the most common cultivated crop encountered was corn followed by potato sugar beet winter wheat and chicory table 1 the terrain in these fields was generally flat to gently sloping sandy soils were encountered in most of the fields except for tw07 where the soil holds slightly higher loam content 2 2 in situ surface soil moisture and cone index measurements aside from the soil moisture networks we also collected in situ surface soil moisture and cone index measurements from the nine agricultural fields fig 1 these were taken from two growing seasons specifically from 26 may 2016 to 09 october 2017 for each growing season a field was visited at least twice to collect measurements during different soil moisture conditions the number of measurements ranged from 10 to 30 points per field per measurement day depending on the size of the field the points are 15 20 m apart and forms somewhat of a grid for each field in addition measurements were always taken at the same location for both surface soil moisture and penetration resistance the measurement locations were also kept the same during succeeding measurement days for a growing season this was not feasible for both years because the changes in crop planted made it difficult to keep the locations of existing points in total 840 actual measurement points were collected over all study sites surface soil moisture was measured using a hand held time domain reflectrometry tdr device trime imko with 5 cm pins the calibration of tdr for sandy soils at the study sites was performed against volumetric soil moisture values from undisturbed samples collected during several occasions within the whole field campaign fig 2 a total of 127 sample points were used for calibration using linear regression the calibrated volumetric soil moisture vwc is given by the function 1 vwc 0 797 x 0 114 where x is the soil moisture measured using the tdr device the linear function used adequately fitted the points based on r 2 0 681 in addition rmse 0 067 cm3 cm 3 indicated small differences between these two measurements and bias 0 064 cm3 cm 3 indicated that measurements using the tdr device gave slightly lower readings compared to those from undisturbed samples penetration resistance measurements were obtained using a hand held penetrometer eijkelkamp penetrologger with a 1 cm cone diameter and a 60 degree angle we referred to the penetration resistance measurements also as the cone index ci the measurements were taken from the soil surface until 20 cm for every 1 cm depth interval 2 3 sentinel 1 imagery the sar instrument on board the sentinel 1 satellites operates in c band 5 405 ghz which in interferometric wide swath iw mode provides over land images at vv and vh polarization with pixel spacing of 10 m 10 m and a reported radiometric accuracy of 1 db 3σ torres et al 2012 sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b provide images since 3 october 2014 and 26 september 2016 respectively the combination of sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b results in a revisit time of 3 days over the raam study area and a revisit time of 1 5 days over the twente study area given the higher sensitivity to soil moisture of backscatter observations acquired in vv polarization than in vh polarization e g baghdadi et al 2017 bousbih et al 2017 hajj et al 2017 we used the observations in vv polarization to retrieve soil moisture the sentinel 1 images are freely available via the copernicus open access hub esa 2019 we applied the following operations to convert raw pixel values into radar backscatter σ 1 range doppler terrain correction rdtc using the tool in the sentinel application platform snap software which includes a radiometric calibration b reprojection to correct for distortions due to topographical variations and tilt of the satellite sensor and c radiometric normalization with projected local incidence angles and 2 a 5 5 median speckle filter to suppress speckle noise projected local incidence angles of the sentinel 1 observations vary between 36 8 and 40 7 for the raam study area and 31 5 and 46 7 for the twente study area we normalized the backscatter observations to a reference angle of 40 using a cosine correction ulaby et al 1986 2 σ ref o σ o cos n φ ref cos n φ inc where σ ref o in m2m 2 is the backscatter observation normalized to a reference angle φ ref of 40 σ o is the backscatter observation in m2m 2 and φ inc is the local projected incidence angle in degrees we assumed a value of n 2 based on c band sar observations in previous studies lievens et al 2011 van der velde and su 2009 mladenova et al 2013 van der velde et al 2015 which corresponds to the assumption that re radiation from the soil surface follows lambert s cosine law ulaby et al 1986 sentinel 1 observations that exceed the upper limit of 2 db or the lower limit of 22 db the maximum noise equivalent sigma zero were taken out 3 methods the analysis carried out for monitoring field trafficability using sentinel 1 was divided into three parts fig 3 the first section describes the soil moisture retrieval from sentinel 1 backscatter values this section also includes the validation of soil moisture retrievals using time series field measurements the second section describes the coupling of surface and topsoil soil moisture values by looking at the variability between the two this was needed in order to identify which surface soil moisture values e g derived from sentinel 1 are representative for the total soil moisture content within the topsoil using these results the third section describes the probabilistic framework applied to express field trafficability using in situ measurements of surface soil moisture and cone index 3 1 soil moisture retrieval change detection algorithm the change detection algorithm developed by wagner et al 1999 linearly relates backscatter in db to a relative soil moisture index s w of the surface layer over time 3 s w t σ 40 o o t σ 40 o min o σ 40 o max o σ 40 o min o where σ 40 o min o and σ 40 o max o are the backscatter observations under dry and wet soil conditions in cm3cm 3 respectively the absolute minimum and maximum values of σ 40 o o are probably outliers due to radiometric noise speckle or exceptional surface conditions such as wet snow or surface inundation pathe et al 2009 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 to exclude these outliers we estimated the σ 40 o min o and σ 40 o max o by the 2 5 and 97 5 percentile of the time series for the calculation of σ 40 o min o and σ 40 o max o we used time series of two complete hydrological years between 1 march 2016 and 1 march 2018 resulting in 395 images over the twente region and 198 over the raam catchment for backscatter observations that exceed σ 40 o min o or σ 40 o max o s w t is set equal to 0 or 1 respectively the main assumption of the change detection algorithm is that the parameters other than soil moisture are considered time invariant such as surface roughness and vegetation the change detection algorithm is promising for operational applications of soil moisture retrievals from satellite observations because the model is build only on a statistical analysis of backscatter time series and no detailed ground parameters are required wagner et al 1999 pathe et al 2009 hornacek et al 2012 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 although wagner et al 1999 developed the change detection algorithm for coarse satellite observations european remote sensing scatterometer satellites spatial resolution 50 km several studies obtained acceptable correlations with in situ soil moisture measurements using sar observations at c band pathe et al 2009 hornacek et al 2012 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 the change detection algorithm results in a relative soil moisture estimate whereas absolute soil moisture corresponding to the volumetric water content is needed for mapping field trafficability this problem is circumvented here by assuming that soil moisture varies between the wilting point θ wp and saturated soil moisture content θ sat which allowed us to linearly scale s w to volumetric soil moisture θ in cm3cm 3 as follows 4 θ t θ sat θ wp s w t θ wp the bodemfysische eenhedenkaart bofek2012 provides the soil type classes and associated soil physical characteristics including van genuchten parameters for the soil units in the netherlands wösten et al 2001 wosten et al 2013 then the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 gives the soil moisture content at wilting point and saturated conditions table 2 benninga et al 2018 showed that the wilting point and saturated soil moisture content calculated from bofek2012 align with the minimum and maximum soil moisture measurements at 5 cm depth of the individual stations of the raam network 3 1 1 validation of sentinel 1 estimates using in situ measurements the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals were evaluated against reference soil moisture values at the study sites we utilized the 5 cm soil moisture measurements from the nine stations as reference values to validate the soil moisture retrievals from sentinel 1 a subset of the total dataset was obtained based on the common dates for both datasets aside from the original 10 m resolution we tested four aggregation methods in order to determine the optimal pixel resolution for sentinel 1 the first method employed aggregation to coarser resolutions of all the pixels in the sentinel 1 image after masking out those which were not agricultural lands or low vegetation nature areas for the second method we aggregated only the pixels within each field boundary after masking out pixels outside each field for the third method we aggregated only the surrounding pixels with the station located at the center a circular buffer around each station was created to mask out the pixels outside the buffer the fourth method involved calculation of the field mean we aggregated the pixels to 50 m 100 m and 150 m for each of the first three aggregation methods the choice of upper limit 150 m for aggregation was based on the size of the smallest field encountered at the study sites table 1 so that it is comparable to area of the largest pixel size used the smallest field is at rm15 with an area of 2 05 ha while a 150 150 m pixel size has an area of 2 25 ha to select the optimal resolution and aggregation method for sentinel 1 we calculated several performance metrics to compare the results we computed rmse bias unbiased rmse and spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the results of aggregation methods used the optimal resolution and aggregation method was further utilized to derive the trafficability status at selected fields over 2016 2017 3 2 soil moisture and cone index variability 3 2 1 vertical soil moisture variability as the first step to relate satellite derived surface soil moisture to field trafficability we investigated when surface soil moisture is a good indicator of subsurface soil moisture conditions we utilized the time series measurements at 5 cm and 20 cm from the selected study sites within twente and raam monitoring networks the 5 cm values represent surface soil moisture measurements as they approximate the depths at which most satellites are able to extract soil moisture information the 20 cm values correspond to measurements at the topsoil depth which carries the weight of overlying machinery several studies have also referred to such depths as the critical layer knight and freitag 1961 paul and de vries 1979 priddy and willoughby 2006 we referred to vertical variability as the irregularity between soil moisture values between 5 cm and 20 cm depths using the time series soil moisture datasets from the raam and twente monitoring networks we applied residuals analysis to look at de coupling between surface and topsoil moisture conditions carranza et al 2018 inferred that there is lower vertical variability during coupled soil moisture conditions the analysis involved fitting a non parametric loess function to relate surface and topsoil values after which residuals from the fitted loess function were used to calculate the residuals variance this showed the vertical variability throughout the whole soil moisture range encountered at the study sites to determine whether coupling or decoupling is present given any soil moisture value the cumulative residuals variance line was plotted this allowed us to observe changes in the variance of residuals as they were reflected as changes in the slope of the cumulative variance line the soil moisture range with flatter slopes indicated lower variability or coupled range and vice versa to get an impression of the similarity in soil moisture at 5 cm and 20 cm during coupled and decoupled conditions the ratio between two was computed as a simple quantitative measure of correspondence a bayesian approach developed and explained in detail by kruschke 2013 was applied to determine the probabilistic mean of these ratios the mean of 5 20 cm ratio is the parameter of interest that will be estimated briefly the method involved monte carlo markov chain mcmc to generate a large representative sample 100 000 samples to approximate the posterior distribution of the parameter of interest from the posterior distribution the mean as well as the high density interval hdi where 95 of the estimates lie was calculated mcmc sampling was performed separately for the coupled and decoupled range 3 2 2 cone index seasonal variability we also investigated if there is a trend in ci values over a growing season using the median and interquartile range iqr of ci over the topsoil upper 20 cm values this was performed for four fields where the most frequent measurements were made these fields are rm07 rm08 tw02 and tw10 tw02 is a grass field while the other three are cultivated fields see table 1 we accounted for differences in soil moisture by correcting ci values to a single soil moisture value based on the method of busscher et al 1997 visual assessment of the median and iqr for different dates was performed to compare ci values and to identify if there are trends over the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 3 3 probabilistic framework to model field trafficability a probabilistic approach was applied in identifying trafficable conditions this allowed for the variabilities encountered in the in situ measurements to be incorporated in the analysis first we determined the joint empirical probability density function pdf for cone index and surface soil moisture using kernel density estimation kde the pdf s were then utilized to calculate the conditional probabilities to express field trafficability 3 3 1 estimating joint probability density function pdf for ci and surface soil moisture we selected a subset of the in situ measurement points using the coupled range identified in section 3 2 1 at this range surface soil moisture can be directly related to ci as it is a good indicator of values for the whole topsoil in situ measurement points that belong to the decoupled range were discarded initial visual inspection of the measurement values revealed that those collected from grass fields tend to have higher cone index values than those in cultivated fields the probabilistic method in section 3 2 1 was applied and extended to test whether these measurements indeed form two separate groups and merited separate analyses this method is similar to a t test with the main goal of determining whether the ci values are distinct from each group the posterior distributions of grass and cultivated field were estimated using mcmc also using 100 000 representative samples to test the similarity between these two groups the difference of means between every combination of representative values was obtained two groups were deemed similar if the difference between the means between their posterior distribution were close to or equal to zero kernel density estimation kde was applied afterwards to determine the empirical bivariate distribution of surface soil moisture and cone index this is a non parametric method to estimate the underlying probability density function pdf of a random variable parzen 1962 rosenblatt 1956 using kernels it is a suitable method for datasets with complicated distribution since no assumption is made on the shape of the underlying density function density estimation is carried out by centering a kernel at the location of each data point the overall density estimate is obtained by summing all the densities estimated at each point points that plot closer to each other will have more kernels centered nearby which yields higher density estimates in the bivariate case the data points were represented by two vectors x 1 x 11 x 12 x 13 x 1n and x 1 x 21 x 22 x 23 x 2n where x i x 1i x 2i was a sample from a bivariate distribution f these two vectors represent the datasets collected for surface soil moisture and ci the bivariate kernel density estimator f was given by 5 f ˆ x h 1 n i 1 n k h x x i where k h is a non negative kernel function and h is the kernel bandwidth that controls the amount of smoothing to calculate the joint pdf of soil moisture and ci using kde we utilized a gaussian kernel with bandwidths represented by h for a univariate case obtained using scott s rule scott 1992 for cultivated fields we obtained a value of h sm 0 022 cm3 cm 3 and h ci 0 138 mpa and for grass fields we obtained h sm 0 001 cm3 cm 3 and h ci 0 184 mpa from the joint pdf of ci and soil moisture we generated 500 random samples from a multivariate normal distribution using the bandwidth matrix derived gentle 2009 the random samples were drawn with replacement along the length of x total number of paired data points and then adding random noise or perturbations to the sampled values using bandwidth matrix h these random samples were used to calculate the conditional probabilities 3 3 2 determining conditional probabilities for ci to express trafficability for a given soil moisture we calculated the cumulative conditional probability that the corresponding ci will take a value less than or equal to a known threshold higher probability values indicated poor trafficability we used a value from droogers et al 1996 who applied 0 70 mpa as the threshold for conditions suitable for agricultural traffic using the randomly generated points trafficability is evaluated using the conditional cumulative distribution function ccdf given by f x a this expressed the cumulative probability of a random variable x conditioned on the occurrence of an event a 6 f x a x p x x a in this case we determined the cumulative probability that a cone index value x will less than or equal to x 0 7 mpa given a soil moisture value a higher probability values indicate conditions not favorable for traffic vice versa based on the results obtained in section 4 1 soil moisture from sentinel 1 images were transformed into its corresponding probability values for trafficability 4 results and discussion 4 1 surface soil moisture from sentinel 1 fig 4 shows the calculated accuracy metrics for using the four aggregation methods applied the plot shows improvement in accuracy in all four metrics when larger pixel sizes are used compared to the original 10 m pixel size of sentinel 1 values for rmse bias and unbiased rmse are lower while spearman s correlation is higher for larger pixel sizes compared to the original 10 m sentinel 1 pixel size from the four resolutions tested using 150 m pixel resolution provides the best results furthermore aggregation of all the pixels in a scene results in slightly higher accuracy values for all the study sites we observed smaller variability for each metric calculated when aggregating all the pixels in a scene compared to the other methods radiometric uncertainties at the field scale which affect the soil moisture retrieval accuracy may be influenced by speckle effects ulaby et al 1986 aggregation of the original sentinel 1 observations to larger pixels sizes implies a larger number of independent samples that leads to the suppression of speckle effects this is critical for improving σ o uncertainties our results are in line with other studies who showed that aggregation of sar pixels produced better results for instance pierdicca et al 2013 obtained higher soil moisture retrieval accuracy when aggregating pixels to field scale using synthetically generated σ o representing sentinel 1 observations of bare soil pathe et al 2009 found that retrieval errors may be dominated by noise in sar measurements even when assuming high model parameter errors to account for the neglect of vegetation effects they further suggested that several pixels should be averaged to decrease the noise level even at the expense of the spatial resolution of the soil moisture maps for the different land cover types we see no apparent trend in the results for instance points in fig 4 for grass green points and cultivated fields brown points do not reveal any clustering from the plots which implies that the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals from sentinel 1 is comparable for grass and cultivated fields aside from soil moisture a component of the total radar backscatter is due to the influence of surface roughness and vegetation in cultivated fields tillage activities at the beginning of a growing season effect changes to surface roughness based on field measurements callens et al 2006 showed that after the onset of the first rainfall events surface roughness remains fairly stable a sensitivity analysis performed by joseph et al 2010 on soil moisture retrieval across the corn growth cycle also came to a similar conclusion in grass fields and meadows surface roughness may be considered invariable over longer periods of time an assumption frequently adopted in soil moisture retrieval methods e g álvarez mozos et al 2006 van der velde et al 2012 the magnitude of vegetation effects on the total backscatter depends on sensor specifications e g frequency incidence angle polarization and vegetation type effects of grass on σ o is generally expected to be weak because the dimensions of scatterers i e leaves and stems are small in comparison to the sar wavelength e g van der velde and su 2009 however the effects may be significant in cultivated fields for example joseph et al 2010 quantified the effect of corn across its growth cycle on c and l band backscattering at incidence angles of 15 35 and 55 they showed that throughout the corn growth cycle both an attenuated soil return and vegetation scattering can dominate the measured σ o however the measured σ o still displayed some sensitivity to soil moisture even at peak biomass despite the known impacts of surface roughness and vegetation previous studies have shown that change detection method can reasonably track changes in soil moisture using multi temporal satellite imagery e g moran et al 2000 baghdadi et al 2007 pathe et al 2009 since it tries to overcome the difficulties in applying bare soil and vegetation backscatter models by only interpreting changes in backscatter rather than absolute backscatter levels for the performance of linear transformation applied see eq 4 the accuracy might vary depending on the actual soil moisture distribution at the study sites the range of soil moisture encountered span from dry to wet conditions which are close to the θ wp and θ sat parameter values applied however in regions where soil moisture distribution is skewed e g very dry or very wet climates the linear transformation method might not be the optimal choice if the range of soil moisture values encountered is limited and σ min and σ max are not measured under conditions of θ wp and θ sat in such cases another transformation may be more appropriate for instance cumulative distribution function cdf matching reichle and koster 2004 can be applied as this method allows to incorporate the soil moisture distribution in scaling s w values 4 2 soil moisture and cone index variability the scatterplot in fig 5 left shows a general linear trend across the soil moisture range the variability across the soil moisture range is not constant based on the length of the standard deviation bars however it is not very easy to visualize trends in variability from the scatterplot alone further examination of the variance of residuals from the fitted loess function fig 5 center reveals that for dry conditions variance is consistently higher compared to those during wet conditions a change from higher to lower variance occurs at 0 19 cm3 cm 3 based on the change in slope in the cumulative variance line from this we determine that values from 0 19 cm3 cm 3 corresponds to a decoupled soil moisture range while those 0 19 cm3 cm 3 corresponds to the coupled range carranza et al 2018 for assessment of trafficability wetter soil moisture conditions are of primary interest since soils are generally more susceptible to compaction during wet conditions we found coupling between surface and topsoil soil moisture values therefore the former is a good representative of the total soil moisture within the latter this is further confirmed by the probabilistic mean calculated a value equal to 1 036 cm3 cm 3 for the 5 20 cm ratio fig 5 right indicates an almost 1 1 correspondence between the two this implies that surface soil moisture for instance those derived from sentinel 1 can already be used as a proxy for topsoil values without the need for a separate analysis to convert surface values to topsoil soil moisture content for the decoupled range the probabilistic mean is 0 547 cm3 cm 3 which means that subsurface values can be twice as much as the surface ci plots over the topsoil for four fields show the variability over a growing season fig 6 ci values in cultivated fields increase in median and iqr towards mid growing season and then decreases at the end or after harvest this shows that ci becomes higher and more variable mid growing season when the crops are mature however this trend was not observed in the grass field tw02 aside from soil moisture we hypothesize the root growth affects the temporal variability of ci for cultivated fields for the grass field the lack of trend observed is still inconclusive since we only had one site several studies have already looked at importance of roots in increasing soil strength but has been investigated mainly in relation to erosion and hazards de baets et al 2008 fan and su 2008 mickovski et al 2009 studies investigating the impact of root growth on soil hydraulic properties and field trafficability is still rare in literature e g wieder and shoop 2017 4 3 probabilistic modeling of field trafficability the calibrated values plotted in fig 7 left show that grass fields have higher ci values compared to those in cultivated fields these two groups also show different probabilistic mean ci which warrants separate analysis for trafficability fig 7 right grass fields have a probabilistic mean ci of 1 74 mpa while cultivated fields have 0 709 mpa the posterior distribution of the mean ci for cultivated and grass fields do not overlap and differ by at least 1 mpa this difference can be attributed to the type of land management in these fields for cultivated fields yearly tillage loosens the soil so that ci values become lower at the beginning of the growing season for grass fields regular mowing and trampling of animals results in higher ci fields which remain as grass fields become more compacted over time as they are not being tilled faunal activities e g from burrowing animals may alleviate soil compaction to a certain degree but based on our measurements these are not enough for grass fields to have similar ci values to cultivated fields fig 8 shows the bivariate pdf s obtained and random samples generated for cultivated and grass fields aside from having generally higher values grass fields also have higher variability as seen from the spread of points in the scatterplot fig 7 and bivariate pdf s fig 8 the variability observed in the pdf s implies that ci values does not depend on soil moisture alone aside from soil moisture bulk density also controls ci values but was implicitly incorporated when we separated the analysis for cultivated and grass fields the differences in ci for cultivated and grass fields already indicate their differences in bulk densities the distribution of random samples closely approximate the original measurement data distribution ci but not for soil moisture fig 8 bottom panel however the soil moisture values from the random samples generated seem to approximate the realistic range and distribution of soil moisture this was confirmed by also plotting the 5 cm time series measurements from both raam and twente networks plot not shown in addition our measurements might also be incomplete since we were not able to encounter all possible soil moisture values from fig 7 we lack measurements beyond 0 4 cm3 cm 3 for grass and between 0 35 0 4 cm3 cm 3 for cultivated fields nevertheless we were still able to generate random samples from the underlying distribution of soil moisture with the bandwidths used see section 3 3 1 the pdf s generated over the study two year period only reflect average normal weather conditions in the netherlands which is characterized by having moderate rainfall over the whole year similar to our measurements fig 8 intermediate soil moisture values 20 30 cm3 cm 3 are the most frequent while very dry and very wet conditions occur less frequently therefore the pdf s obtained are more suitable for predicting trafficability during average weather years since the shape of the pdf used is not universal the results of the analysis may be suboptimal for periods when or areas where very wet or very dry weather conditions are prevalent modeling trafficability for such conditions can be done if the appropriate bivariate pdf s can be selected as for the trend in soil strength values over the whole soil moisture range we observed that it is consistent with previous studies henderson et al 1988 vaz et al 2011 they have shown as increasing ci trend towards drier conditions our findings are similar despite using only surface soil moisture values this further strengthens the potential for using satellite derived surface soil moisture for monitoring field trafficability 4 4 monitoring trafficability with sentinel 1 a small area around the vicinity of rm07 in the raam catchment is selected as a test site to demonstrate monitoring of trafficability in grass and cultivated fields fig 9 top panel here we show the plots at four locations 2 in grass and 2 in cultivated fields a 150 m pixel resolution was used based on the results in section 4 1 the time series plots in fig 9 show soil moisture at the center of each selected field changes in the status of trafficability is easily observed from the high temporal resolution of sentinel 1 although in 2016 available sentinel 1 imagery was lesser compared to 2017 probability values for cultivated fields are much higher compared to grass fields even though the range of soil moisture encountered for both types of fields were the same soil moisture at the four selected locations all show seasonality but inter field variability is larger for cultivated fields compared to grass fields we also observed the same inter field variability for other locations both grass and cultivated fields in this selected area plot not included here from the time series plots in fig 9 we can identify time periods with lower probability values which translates to good trafficability conditions for the two cultivated fields this is observed in early spring around april of 2017 this also coincides with the timing of tillage for some fields in the netherlands for spring of 2016 however the trafficability conditions between these two cultivated fields vary for c1 soil moisture conditions indicate good trafficability while for c2 it is the opposite case the soil moisture in c2 did not decrease so the trafficability conditions did not improve over the spring period this difference may due to types of crops grown as well as how these fields were managed in previous years grass fields always appear to be trafficable given the threshold value used this is not the case for cultivated fields where there are more pronounced fluctuations in trafficable conditions however the results for grass fields may not always hold true especially for tractors with very heavy weights in principle these vehicles are legally allowed to reach up to 21 tons per axle eu regulation 167 2013 in contrast to our results for grass fields the soil may not be trafficable for very heavy vehicles during saturated conditions the threshold value we used may be a more reasonable indicator of trafficability using average tractor weights ranging from 6 8 tons these results could potentially be used by farmers and water managers alike for farmers the results can be used to identify periods suitable for traffic and to aid in deciding when to initiate tillage activities although in practice this might still be difficult to apply since farmers still need to work on their fields despite conditions unfavorable for traffic nevertheless the results can help in increasing awareness as to when soils are more susceptible to compaction for water managers the results could aid in their decisions to adjust water levels in channels and or canals in order to meet the water demands of farmers 5 conclusion in this paper we demonstrated how sentinel 1 can be used to monitor trafficability status in agricultural fields our findings show that by identifying coupled conditions satellite derived surface soil moisture can be directly related with cone index values since we focused only on soil moisture as the dominant temporal control expressing trafficability as probability values is advantageous because uncertainties are already incorporated however further attention should be given to the impacts of root growth as it may also act as a significant temporal control for cone index finally we showed that the high temporal resolution of sentinel 1 is suitable for tracking the changes in agricultural field trafficability however our results show that aggregation to coarser resolution may be necessary which may also preclude identifying the spatial variability within a field acknowledgements this work is part of the research programme optimizing water availability

10887,the use of heavy mobile machinery in agriculture for tillage and harvesting is now indispensable since it facilitates farming over large areas however one of the impacts of regular and prolonged use of heavy mobile machinery is soil compaction to help minimize this harmful effect trafficability of agricultural fields needs to be determined soil moisture acts as one of the dominant controls for field trafficability therefore satellites such as sentinel 1 which is one source of spatio temporal soil moisture information could be useful in assessing trafficable conditions one limitation of satellite derived soil moisture is that only the upper surface layer is mapped in this study we determined the feasibility of sentinel 1 surface soil moisture to monitor trafficability over 2016 2017 we first determined coupled conditions when surface soil moisture is a good indicator for values at the subsurface we applied a probabilistic approach to determine trafficability using extensive in situ measurements of penetration resistance and surface soil moisture over a variety of crops trafficability is expressed as the probability that penetration resistance will exceed a threshold for a given soil moisture value furthermore we investigated the variability encountered from these measurements to gain insights on other temporal controls our results show coupled conditions for soil moisture 0 19 cm3 cm 3 and there is an almost 1 1 correspondence between surface and subsurface values for decoupled conditions values at the subsurface can be two times more than the surface an increase in penetration resistance variability coincided with the maturity of crops for cultivated fields aside from soil moisture root growth may have a significant impact on the temporal variability of soil s penetration resistance the status of trafficability can be monitored through the high temporal resolution of sentinel 1 however aggregation to coarser resolutions maybe necessary as its original 10 m resolution may be suboptimal based on validation against in situ measurements days favorable for traffic were observed in early spring this information can aid farmers in the timing of tillage activities or for water managers in deciding to adjust water levels to meet agricultural demands keywords agriculture soil moisture trafficability decoupling sentinel 1 kernel density estimation 1 introduction modern agriculture relies on heavy mobile machinery to carry out farming operations such as tillage and harvesting mechanization increases productivity and enables farming activities to be carried out over larger areas this is driven both by the high demand for food production as well as economic factors to make agriculture profitable however one of the negative impacts of using heavy machinery is soil compaction lal 1991 raghavan et al 1990 hamza and anderson 2005 fao 2015 as a form of land degradation soil compaction leads to structural damages to soil baumgartl and horn 1991 eckelmann et al 2006 destruction of soil structure also leads to poor infiltration van dijck and van asch 2002 which in turn leads to water logging run off and erosion ekwue and harrilal 2010 compaction can have negative consequences for crop root growth and soil ecosystems the use of heavy machinery in agriculture is indispensable so a balance in the timing of farming operations and susceptibility of soils to compaction must be achieved in order to minimize the harmful and long term effects a way to minimize the exposure to the negative impacts of using heavy machinery is to determine trafficable conditions for the soil assessment of agricultural field trafficability as well as the operating machinery during periods suitable for traffic can help slow down the rate at which soils are being compacted so that the use of heavy machinery can be sustainable in the long term trafficability is defined by campbell and o sullivan 1991 as the ability of soil to 1 provide adequate traction for vehicles and 2 withstand traffic without excess compaction or structural damage this is an extension to earlier studies for military purposes which were only concerned with vehicle mobility knight and freitag 1961 more recent studies on field trafficability focus on soil vehicle interaction to quantify the amount of soil compaction with different vehicle specifications keller and lamandé 2010 nawaz et al 2013 rücknagel et al 2015 two sets of factors determine whether soils are able to support the weight of overlying machinery without increased risk for compaction on the one hand are soil physical characteristics that dictate the mechanical strength of the soil these include texture and bulk density of the soil müller et al 2011 for soil texture the strength of aggregated soils increases as clay content increases texture wise soils with higher bulk density at the onset of field traffic can withstand higher pressures before undergoing deformation both soil texture and bulk density do not change significantly over short time scales weeks or months but they are important controls over the spatial patterns of trafficability on the other hand are external factors that affect the grain to grain contact of individual soil particles perhaps the most important of these factors is soil moisture for any given texture or bulk density soil strength decreases towards wetter soil moisture conditions therefore soils become more prone to compaction with increasing soil moisture the amount of overlying pressure that soils can accommodate decreases with increasing soil moisture since the grain to grain contact disappears as water fills up the pore space spatio temporal soil moisture variability is influenced by atmospheric conditions seneviratne et al 2010 soil properties rawls et al 1991 and vegetation hupet and vanclooster 2002 soil moisture exerts significant temporal control over soil strength as it varies greatly over short time scales because of changes in the prevailing atmospheric conditions other factors that control compaction are the set of vehicle specifications that determine the impacts of overlying machinery to the soil soil vehicle interaction studies focus on the influence of tire inflation pressure wheel and axle load on soil deformation müller et al 2011 the mechanical strength of the soil can be determined using cone penetrometers kuang et al 2012 upadhyaya 2005 these are widely used instruments for determining soil s penetration resistance which is equivalent to the force per unit base area required to push the cone penetrometer through a specified increment of soil depth bengough et al 2000 asae ep542 1999 they also have the advantage of providing relatively quick and easy measurements in the field cone penetrometer measurements are also referred to as cone index ci existing field trafficability models have related soil moisture with ci using a decreasing exponential function e g henderson et al 1988 ayers and perumpral 1982 sojka et al 2001 vaz et al 2001 with an increasing ci trend towards drier soil moisture conditions several studies are geared towards monitoring and identifying conditions when the ground is less susceptible to compaction for instance earl 1997 and droogers et al 1996 related trafficability and workability to soil hydraulic parameters to determine the number of workable days for a field other studies investigated the spatial variability of soil moisture and ci which can assist farmers in avoiding less trafficable areas within an agricultural field carrara et al 2007 ferrero et al 2005 these studies have shown the impacts of soil moisture on field trafficability trafficability determined from soil moisture would be beneficial for agriculture but this has been hampered in the past by the lack of continuous and available soil moisture data datasets from satellites are potential sources of regular and or frequent soil moisture information that also cover a considerable spatial extent in the last few years developments in mapping soil moisture using microwave remote sensing have been reported with increasing spatial and temporal resolutions and accuracy kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 vereecken et al 2014 techniques using microwave remote sensing are divided into active and passive methods passive microwave remote sensing measures the intensity of microwave emissions from the earth s surface expressed in terms of brightness temperatures these measurements are performed with microwave radiometers active microwave remote sensing supply their own source of illumination active microwave sensors transmit signals towards a target and measures the portion scattered back synthetic aperture radar sar is an active microwave sensing technique providing observations with a higher spatial resolution sar backscatter signals depend on the technical configuration of the sensor as well as the geometric and dielectric properties of objects on earth for soils dielectric properties are highly influenced by its moisture content cihlar and ulaby 1974 sentinel 1 satellites which carry a sar instrument are promising sources of soil moisture information that would be suitable for mapping and monitoring field trafficability at field scale its revisit time can be up to 2 4 days for certain areas in europe torres et al 2012 which makes it highly suitable for monitoring changes in soil moisture the acquired images are also freely and operationally available sentinel 1 measurements are only sensitive to soil moisture in the upper surface layer 5 cm however assessment of trafficability requires soil moisture values over the topsoil or critical layer droogers et al 1996 earl 1997 priddy and willoughby 2006 reintam et al 2016 although values used in literature vary this corresponds roughly to the upper 20 30 cm of the soil layer this means that surface soil moisture from sentinel 1 needs to be translated into subsurface values before it can be used in certain applications the vertical variability of soil moisture may lead to decoupling between surface and subsurface values capehart and carlson 1997 carranza et al 2018 wherein conditions in the former no longer represents those at the latter this complicates the estimation of depth average soil moisture needed for assessment of trafficability identifying coupled soil moisture conditions would be beneficial as it facilitates the use of satellite derived surface soil moisture to assess field trafficability in this study our main objective is to assess whether sentinel 1 derived surface soil moisture can be used to monitor field trafficability for sentinel 1 several aggregation schemes were tested to determine the optimal pixel size the accuracy of these aggregation schemes were validated against reference in situ measurements from two monitoring networks raam and twente networks given the measurement depth limitations of sentinel 1 we first aim to identify conditions when surface soil moisture values are good indicators of those at subsurface in addition the variability encountered from extensive penetration resistance measurements was analyzed in order to gain further insights on its temporal controls a probabilistic approach is applied to express trafficability based on surface soil moisture and to incorporate variabilities encountered from in situ measurements we demonstrate the results over a small site within the raam catchment as an example to show the potential of sentinel 1 for monitoring agricultural field trafficability 2 study area and datasets 2 1 raam and twente soil moisture networks we utilized several locations within the existing soil moisture monitoring network in twente dente et al 2011 and raam catchment benninga et al 2018 as our study sites these two networks contain stations covering the eastern twente network and southeastern raam network parts of the netherlands fig 1 they were installed previously to serve as validation sites for satellite derived data products each station contains sensors that continuously monitor soil moisture over the soil profile soil moisture and temperature sensors ech2o ec tm or 5tm were installed at discrete depths below the surface 5 10 20 40 and 80 cm measurement loggers store values every 15 min for this study we utilized year long measurements from 2016 2017 in both monitoring networks stations were installed in agricultural areas at the edge or corner of a field to allow continuous measurements installation in the middle of the field was not permitted because of tillage harvesting or grazing of animals from the twente network three out of the 20 stations were utilized from the raam network six out of the 15 stations were utilized as study sites these were chosen to capture the variability in the crops encountered at the study sites during the two year study period the nine agricultural fields for this study were either grass or cultivated fields the most common cultivated crop encountered was corn followed by potato sugar beet winter wheat and chicory table 1 the terrain in these fields was generally flat to gently sloping sandy soils were encountered in most of the fields except for tw07 where the soil holds slightly higher loam content 2 2 in situ surface soil moisture and cone index measurements aside from the soil moisture networks we also collected in situ surface soil moisture and cone index measurements from the nine agricultural fields fig 1 these were taken from two growing seasons specifically from 26 may 2016 to 09 october 2017 for each growing season a field was visited at least twice to collect measurements during different soil moisture conditions the number of measurements ranged from 10 to 30 points per field per measurement day depending on the size of the field the points are 15 20 m apart and forms somewhat of a grid for each field in addition measurements were always taken at the same location for both surface soil moisture and penetration resistance the measurement locations were also kept the same during succeeding measurement days for a growing season this was not feasible for both years because the changes in crop planted made it difficult to keep the locations of existing points in total 840 actual measurement points were collected over all study sites surface soil moisture was measured using a hand held time domain reflectrometry tdr device trime imko with 5 cm pins the calibration of tdr for sandy soils at the study sites was performed against volumetric soil moisture values from undisturbed samples collected during several occasions within the whole field campaign fig 2 a total of 127 sample points were used for calibration using linear regression the calibrated volumetric soil moisture vwc is given by the function 1 vwc 0 797 x 0 114 where x is the soil moisture measured using the tdr device the linear function used adequately fitted the points based on r 2 0 681 in addition rmse 0 067 cm3 cm 3 indicated small differences between these two measurements and bias 0 064 cm3 cm 3 indicated that measurements using the tdr device gave slightly lower readings compared to those from undisturbed samples penetration resistance measurements were obtained using a hand held penetrometer eijkelkamp penetrologger with a 1 cm cone diameter and a 60 degree angle we referred to the penetration resistance measurements also as the cone index ci the measurements were taken from the soil surface until 20 cm for every 1 cm depth interval 2 3 sentinel 1 imagery the sar instrument on board the sentinel 1 satellites operates in c band 5 405 ghz which in interferometric wide swath iw mode provides over land images at vv and vh polarization with pixel spacing of 10 m 10 m and a reported radiometric accuracy of 1 db 3σ torres et al 2012 sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b provide images since 3 october 2014 and 26 september 2016 respectively the combination of sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b results in a revisit time of 3 days over the raam study area and a revisit time of 1 5 days over the twente study area given the higher sensitivity to soil moisture of backscatter observations acquired in vv polarization than in vh polarization e g baghdadi et al 2017 bousbih et al 2017 hajj et al 2017 we used the observations in vv polarization to retrieve soil moisture the sentinel 1 images are freely available via the copernicus open access hub esa 2019 we applied the following operations to convert raw pixel values into radar backscatter σ 1 range doppler terrain correction rdtc using the tool in the sentinel application platform snap software which includes a radiometric calibration b reprojection to correct for distortions due to topographical variations and tilt of the satellite sensor and c radiometric normalization with projected local incidence angles and 2 a 5 5 median speckle filter to suppress speckle noise projected local incidence angles of the sentinel 1 observations vary between 36 8 and 40 7 for the raam study area and 31 5 and 46 7 for the twente study area we normalized the backscatter observations to a reference angle of 40 using a cosine correction ulaby et al 1986 2 σ ref o σ o cos n φ ref cos n φ inc where σ ref o in m2m 2 is the backscatter observation normalized to a reference angle φ ref of 40 σ o is the backscatter observation in m2m 2 and φ inc is the local projected incidence angle in degrees we assumed a value of n 2 based on c band sar observations in previous studies lievens et al 2011 van der velde and su 2009 mladenova et al 2013 van der velde et al 2015 which corresponds to the assumption that re radiation from the soil surface follows lambert s cosine law ulaby et al 1986 sentinel 1 observations that exceed the upper limit of 2 db or the lower limit of 22 db the maximum noise equivalent sigma zero were taken out 3 methods the analysis carried out for monitoring field trafficability using sentinel 1 was divided into three parts fig 3 the first section describes the soil moisture retrieval from sentinel 1 backscatter values this section also includes the validation of soil moisture retrievals using time series field measurements the second section describes the coupling of surface and topsoil soil moisture values by looking at the variability between the two this was needed in order to identify which surface soil moisture values e g derived from sentinel 1 are representative for the total soil moisture content within the topsoil using these results the third section describes the probabilistic framework applied to express field trafficability using in situ measurements of surface soil moisture and cone index 3 1 soil moisture retrieval change detection algorithm the change detection algorithm developed by wagner et al 1999 linearly relates backscatter in db to a relative soil moisture index s w of the surface layer over time 3 s w t σ 40 o o t σ 40 o min o σ 40 o max o σ 40 o min o where σ 40 o min o and σ 40 o max o are the backscatter observations under dry and wet soil conditions in cm3cm 3 respectively the absolute minimum and maximum values of σ 40 o o are probably outliers due to radiometric noise speckle or exceptional surface conditions such as wet snow or surface inundation pathe et al 2009 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 to exclude these outliers we estimated the σ 40 o min o and σ 40 o max o by the 2 5 and 97 5 percentile of the time series for the calculation of σ 40 o min o and σ 40 o max o we used time series of two complete hydrological years between 1 march 2016 and 1 march 2018 resulting in 395 images over the twente region and 198 over the raam catchment for backscatter observations that exceed σ 40 o min o or σ 40 o max o s w t is set equal to 0 or 1 respectively the main assumption of the change detection algorithm is that the parameters other than soil moisture are considered time invariant such as surface roughness and vegetation the change detection algorithm is promising for operational applications of soil moisture retrievals from satellite observations because the model is build only on a statistical analysis of backscatter time series and no detailed ground parameters are required wagner et al 1999 pathe et al 2009 hornacek et al 2012 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 although wagner et al 1999 developed the change detection algorithm for coarse satellite observations european remote sensing scatterometer satellites spatial resolution 50 km several studies obtained acceptable correlations with in situ soil moisture measurements using sar observations at c band pathe et al 2009 hornacek et al 2012 bauer marschallinger et al 2018 the change detection algorithm results in a relative soil moisture estimate whereas absolute soil moisture corresponding to the volumetric water content is needed for mapping field trafficability this problem is circumvented here by assuming that soil moisture varies between the wilting point θ wp and saturated soil moisture content θ sat which allowed us to linearly scale s w to volumetric soil moisture θ in cm3cm 3 as follows 4 θ t θ

netherlands wösten et al 2001 wosten et al 2013 then the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 gives the soil moisture content at wilting point and saturated conditions table 2 benninga et al 2018 showed that the wilting point and saturated soil moisture content calculated from bofek2012 align with the minimum and maximum soil moisture measurements at 5 cm depth of the individual stations of the raam network 3 1 1 validation of sentinel 1 estimates using in situ measurements the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals were evaluated against reference soil moisture values at the study sites we utilized the 5 cm soil moisture measurements from the nine stations as reference values to validate the soil moisture retrievals from sentinel 1 a subset of the total dataset was obtained based on the common dates for both datasets aside from the original 10 m resolution we tested four aggregation methods in order to determine the optimal pixel resolution for sentinel 1 the first method employed aggregation to coarser resolutions of all the pixels in the sentinel 1 image after masking out those which were not agricultural lands or low vegetation nature areas for the second method we aggregated only the pixels within each field boundary after masking out pixels outside each field for the third method we aggregated only the surrounding pixels with the station located at the center a circular buffer around each station was created to mask out the pixels outside the buffer the fourth method involved calculation of the field mean we aggregated the pixels to 50 m 100 m and 150 m for each of the first three aggregation methods the choice of upper limit 150 m for aggregation was based on the size of the smallest field encountered at the study sites table 1 so that it is comparable to area of the largest pixel size used the smallest field is at rm15 with an area of 2 05 ha while a 150 150 m pixel size has an area of 2 25 ha to select the optimal resolution and aggregation method for sentinel 1 we calculated several performance metrics to compare the results we computed rmse bias unbiased rmse and spearman s rank correlation coefficient for the results of aggregation methods used the optimal resolution and aggregation method was further utilized to derive the trafficability status at selected fields over 2016 2017 3 2 soil moisture and cone index variability 3 2 1 vertical soil moisture variability as the first step to relate satellite derived surface soil moisture to field trafficability we investigated when surface soil moisture is a good indicator of subsurface soil moisture conditions we utilized the time series measurements at 5 cm and 20 cm from the selected study sites within twente and raam monitoring networks the 5 cm values represent surface soil moisture measurements as they approximate the depths at which most satellites are able to extract soil moisture information the 20 cm values correspond to measurements at the topsoil depth which carries the weight of overlying machinery several studies have also referred to such depths as the critical layer knight and freitag 1961 paul and de vries 1979 priddy and willoughby 2006 we referred to vertical variability as the irregularity between soil moisture values between 5 cm and 20 cm depths using the time series soil moisture datasets from the raam and twente monitoring networks we applied residuals analysis to look at de coupling between surface and topsoil moisture conditions carranza et al 2018 inferred that there is lower vertical variability during coupled soil moisture conditions the analysis involved fitting a non parametric loess function to relate surface and topsoil values after which residuals from the fitted loess function were used to calculate the residuals variance this showed the vertical variability throughout the whole soil moisture range encountered at the study sites to determine whether coupling or decoupling is present given any soil moisture value the cumulative residuals variance line was plotted this allowed us to observe changes in the variance of residuals as they were reflected as changes in the slope of the cumulative variance line the soil moisture range with flatter slopes indicated lower variability or coupled range and vice versa to get an impression of the similarity in soil moisture at 5 cm and 20 cm during coupled and decoupled conditions the ratio between two was computed as a simple quantitative measure of correspondence a bayesian approach developed and explained in detail by kruschke 2013 was applied to determine the probabilistic mean of these ratios the mean of 5 20 cm ratio is the parameter of interest that will be estimated briefly the method involved monte carlo markov chain mcmc to generate a large representative sample 100 000 samples to approximate the posterior distribution of the parameter of interest from the posterior distribution the mean as well as the high density interval hdi where 95 of the estimates lie was calculated mcmc sampling was performed separately for the coupled and decoupled range 3 2 2 cone index seasonal variability we also investigated if there is a trend in ci values over a growing season using the median and interquartile range iqr of ci over the topsoil upper 20 cm values this was performed for four fields where the most frequent measurements were made these fields are rm07 rm08 tw02 and tw10 tw02 is a grass field while the other three are cultivated fields see table 1 we accounted for differences in soil moisture by correcting ci values to a single soil moisture value based on the method of busscher et al 1997 visual assessment of the median and iqr for different dates was performed to compare ci values and to identify if there are trends over the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 3 3 probabilistic framework to model field trafficability a probabilistic approach was applied in identifying trafficable conditions this allowed for the variabilities encountered in the in situ measurements to be incorporated in the analysis first we determined the joint empirical probability density function pdf for cone index and surface soil moisture using kernel density estimation kde the pdf s were then utilized to calculate the conditional probabilities to express field trafficability 3 3 1 estimating joint probability density function pdf for ci and surface soil moisture we selected a subset of the in situ measurement points using the coupled range identified in section 3 2 1 at this range surface soil moisture can be directly related to ci as it is a good indicator of values for the whole topsoil in situ measurement points that belong to the decoupled range were discarded initial visual inspection of the measurement values revealed that those collected from grass fields tend to have higher cone index values than those in cultivated fields the probabilistic method in section 3 2 1 was applied and extended to test whether these measurements indeed form two separate groups and merited separate analyses this method is similar to a t test with the main goal of determining whether the ci values are distinct from each group the posterior distributions of grass and cultivated field were estimated using mcmc also using 100 000 representative samples to test the similarity between these two groups the difference of means between every combination of representative values was obtained two groups were deemed similar if the difference between the means between their posterior distribution were close to or equal to zero kernel density estimation kde was applied afterwards to determine the empirical bivariate distribution of surface soil moisture and cone index this is a non parametric method to estimate the underlying probability density function pdf of a random variable parzen 1962 rosenblatt 1956 using kernels it is a suitable method for datasets with complicated distribution since no assumption is made on the shape of the underlying density function density estimation is carried out by centering a kernel at the location of each data point the overall density estimate is obtained by summing all the densities estimated at each point points that plot closer to each other will have more kernels centered nearby which yields higher density estimates in the bivariate case the data points were represented by two vectors x 1 x 11 x 12 x 13 x 1n and x 1 x 21 x 22 x 23 x 2n where x i x 1i x 2i was a sample from a bivariate distribution f these two vectors represent the datasets collected for surface soil moisture and ci the bivariate kernel density estimator f was given by 5 f ˆ x h 1 n i 1 n k h x x i where k h is a non negative kernel function and h is the kernel bandwidth that controls the amount of smoothing to calculate the joint pdf of soil moisture and ci using kde we utilized a gaussian kernel with bandwidths represented by h for a univariate case obtained using scott s rule scott 1992 for cultivated fields we obtained a value of h sm 0 022 cm3 cm 3 and h ci 0 138 mpa and for grass fields we obtained h sm 0 001 cm3 cm 3 and h ci 0 184 mpa from the joint pdf of ci and soil moisture we generated 500 random samples from a multivariate normal distribution using the bandwidth matrix derived gentle 2009 the random samples were drawn with replacement along the length of x total number of paired data points and then adding random noise or perturbations to the sampled values using bandwidth matrix h these random samples were used to calculate the conditional probabilities 3 3 2 determining conditional probabilities for ci to express trafficability for a given soil moisture we calculated the cumulative conditional probability that the corresponding ci will take a value less than or equal to a known threshold higher probability values indicated poor trafficability we used a value from droogers et al 1996 who applied 0 70 mpa as the threshold for conditions suitable for agricultural traffic using the randomly generated points trafficability is evaluated using the conditional cumulative distribution function ccdf given by f x a this expressed the cumulative probability of a random variable x conditioned on the occurrence of an event a 6 f x a x p x x a in this case we determined the cumulative probability that a cone index value x will less than or equal to x 0 7 mpa given a soil moisture value a higher probability values indicate conditions not favorable for traffic vice versa based on the results obtained in section 4 1 soil moisture from sentinel 1 images were transformed into its corresponding probability values for trafficability 4 results and discussion 4 1 surface soil moisture from sentinel 1 fig 4 shows the calculated accuracy metrics for using the four aggregation methods applied the plot shows improvement in accuracy in all four metrics when larger pixel sizes are used compared to the original 10 m pixel size of sentinel 1 values for rmse bias and unbiased rmse are lower while spearman s correlation is higher for larger pixel sizes compared to the original 10 m sentinel 1 pixel size from the four resolutions tested using 150 m pixel resolution provides the best results furthermore aggregation of all the pixels in a scene results in slightly higher accuracy values for all the study sites we observed smaller variability for each metric calculated when aggregating all the pixels in a scene compared to the other methods radiometric uncertainties at the field scale which affect the soil moisture retrieval accuracy may be influenced by speckle effects ulaby et al 1986 aggregation of the original sentinel 1 observations to larger pixels sizes implies a larger number of independent samples that leads to the suppression of speckle effects this is critical for improving σ o uncertainties our results are in line with other studies who showed that aggregation of sar pixels produced better results for instance pierdicca et al 2013 obtained higher soil moisture retrieval accuracy when aggregating pixels to field scale using synthetically generated σ o representing sentinel 1 observations of bare soil pathe et al 2009 found that retrieval errors may be dominated by noise in sar measurements even when assuming high model parameter errors to account for the neglect of vegetation effects they further suggested that several pixels should be averaged to decrease the noise level even at the expense of the spatial resolution of the soil moisture maps for the different land cover types we see no apparent trend in the results for instance points in fig 4 for grass green points and cultivated fields brown points do not reveal any clustering from the plots which implies that the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals from sentinel 1 is comparable for grass and cultivated fields aside from soil moisture a component of the total radar backscatter is due to the influence of surface roughness and vegetation in cultivated fields tillage activities at the beginning of a growing season effect changes to surface roughness based on field measurements callens et al 2006 showed that after the onset of the first rainfall events surface roughness remains fairly stable a sensitivity analysis performed by joseph et al 2010 on soil moisture retrieval across the corn growth cycle also came to a similar conclusion in grass fields and meadows surface roughness may be considered invariable over longer periods of time an assumption frequently adopted in soil moisture retrieval methods e g álvarez mozos et al 2006 van der velde et al 2012 the magnitude of vegetation effects on the total backscatter depends on sensor specifications e g frequency incidence angle polarization and vegetation type effects of grass on σ o is generally expected to be weak because the dimensions of scatterers i e leaves and stems are small in comparison to the sar wavelength e g van der velde and su 2009 however the effects may be significant in cultivated fields for example joseph et al 2010 quantified the effect of corn across its growth cycle on c and l band backscattering at incidence angles of 15 35 and 55 they showed that throughout the corn growth cycle both an attenuated soil return and vegetation scattering can dominate the measured σ o however the measured σ o still displayed some sensitivity to soil moisture even at peak biomass despite the known impacts of surface roughness and vegetation previous studies have shown that change detection method can reasonably track changes in soil moisture using multi temporal satellite imagery e g moran et al 2000 baghdadi et al 2007 pathe et al 2009 since it tries to overcome the difficulties in applying bare soil and vegetation backscatter models by only interpreting changes in backscatter rather than absolute backscatter levels for the performance of linear transformation applied see eq 4 the accuracy might vary depending on the actual soil moisture distribution at the study sites the range of soil moisture encountered span from dry to wet conditions which are close to the θ wp and θ sat parameter values applied however in regions where soil moisture distribution is skewed e g very dry or very wet climates the linear transformation method might not be the optimal choice if the range of soil moisture values encountered is limited and σ min and σ max are not measured under conditions of θ wp and θ sat in such cases another transformation may be more appropriate for instance cumulative distribution function cdf matching reichle and koster 2004 can be applied as this method allows to incorporate the soil moisture distribution in scaling s w values 4 2 soil moisture and cone index variability the scatterplot in fig 5 left shows a general linear trend across the soil moisture range the variability across the soil moisture range is not constant based on the length of the standard deviation bars however it is not very easy to visualize trends in variability from the scatterplot alone further examination of the variance of residuals from the fitted loess function fig 5 center reveals that for dry conditions variance is consistently higher compared to those during wet conditions a change from higher to lower variance occurs at 0 19 cm3 cm 3 based on the change in slope in the cumulative variance line from this we determine that values from 0 19 cm3 cm 3 corresponds to a decoupled soil moisture range while those 0 19 cm3 cm 3 corresponds to the coupled range carranza et al 2018 for assessment of trafficability wetter soil moisture conditions are of primary interest since soils are generally more susceptible to compaction during wet conditions we found coupling between surface and topsoil soil moisture values therefore the former is a good representative of the total soil moisture within the latter this is further confirmed by the probabilistic mean calculated a value equal to 1 036 cm3 cm 3 for the 5 20 cm ratio fig 5 right indicates an almost 1 1 correspondence between the two this implies that surface soil moisture for instance those derived from sentinel 1 can already be used as a proxy for topsoil values without the need for a separate analysis to convert surface values to topsoil soil moisture content for the decoupled range the probabilistic mean is 0 547 cm3 cm 3 which means that subsurface values can be twice as much as the surface ci plots over the topsoil for four fields show the variability over a growing season fig 6 ci values in cultivated fields increase in median and iqr towards mid growing season and then decreases at the end or after harvest this shows that ci becomes higher and more variable mid growing season when the crops are mature however this trend was not observed in the grass field tw02 aside from soil moisture we hypothesize the root growth affects the temporal variability of ci for cultivated fields for the grass field the lack of trend observed is still inconclusive since we only had one site several studies have already looked at importance of roots in increasing soil strength but has been investigated mainly in relation to erosion and hazards de baets et al 2008 fan and su 2008 mickovski et al 2009 studies investigating the impact of root growth on soil hydraulic properties and field trafficability is still rare in literature e g wieder and shoop 2017 4 3 probabilistic modeling of field trafficability the calibrated values plotted in fig 7 left show that grass fields have higher ci values compared to those in cultivated fields these two groups also show different probabilistic mean ci which warrants separate analysis for trafficability fig 7 right grass fields have a probabilistic mean ci of 1 74 mpa while cultivated fields have 0 709 mpa the posterior distribution of the mean ci for cultivated and grass fields do not overlap and differ by at least 1 mpa this difference can be attributed to the type of land management in these fields for cultivated fields yearly tillage loosens the soil so that ci values become lower at the beginning of the growing season for grass fields regular mowing and trampling of animals results in higher ci fields which remain as grass fields become more compacted over time as they are not being tilled faunal activities e g from burrowing animals may alleviate soil compaction to a certain degree but based on our measurements these are not enough for grass fields to have similar ci values to cultivated fields fig 8 shows the bivariate pdf s obtained and random samples generated for cultivated and grass fields aside from having generally higher values grass fields also have higher variability as seen from the spread of points in the scatterplot fig 7 and bivariate pdf s fig 8 the variability observed in the pdf s implies that ci values does not depend on soil moisture alone aside from soil moisture bulk density also controls ci values but was implicitly incorporated when we separated the analysis for cultivated and grass fields the differences in ci for cultivated and grass fields already indicate their differences in bulk densities the distribution of random samples closely approximate the original measurement data distribution ci but not for soil moisture fig 8 bottom panel however the soil moisture values from the random samples generated seem to approximate the realistic range and distribution of soil moisture this was confirmed by also plotting the 5 cm time series measurements from both raam and twente networks plot not shown in addition our measurements might also be incomplete since we were not able to encounter all possible soil moisture values from fig 7 we lack measurements beyond 0 4 cm3 cm 3 for grass and between 0 35 0 4 cm3 cm 3 for cultivated fields nevertheless we were still able to generate random samples from the underlying distribution of soil moisture with the bandwidths used see section 3 3 1 the pdf s generated over the study two year period only reflect average normal weather conditions in the netherlands which is characterized by having moderate rainfall over the whole year similar to our measurements fig 8 intermediate soil moisture values 20 30 cm3 cm 3 are the most frequent while very dry and very wet conditions occur less frequently therefore the pdf s obtained are more suitable for predicting trafficability during average weather years since the shape of the pdf used is not universal the results of the analysis may be suboptimal for periods when or areas where very wet or very dry weather conditions are prevalent modeling trafficability for such conditions can be done if the appropriate bivariate pdf s can be selected as for the trend in soil strength values over the whole soil moisture range we observed that it is consistent with previous studies henderson et al 1988 vaz et al 2011 they have shown as increasing ci trend towards drier conditions our findings are similar despite using only surface soil moisture values this further strengthens the potential for using satellite derived surface soil moisture for monitoring field trafficability 4 4 monitoring trafficability with sentinel 1 a small area around the vicinity of rm07 in the raam catchment is selected as a test site to demonstrate monitoring of trafficability in grass and cultivated fields fig 9 top panel here we show the plots at four locations 2 in grass and 2 in cultivated fields a 150 m pixel resolution was used based on the results in section 4 1 the time series plots in fig 9 show soil moisture at the center of each selected field changes in the status of trafficability is easily observed from the high temporal resolution of sentinel 1 although in 2016 available sentinel 1 imagery was lesser compared to 2017 probability values for cultivated fields are much higher compared to grass fields even though the range of soil moisture encountered for both types of fields were the same soil moisture at the four selected locations all show seasonality but inter field variability is larger for cultivated fields compared to grass fields we also observed the same inter field variability for other locations both grass and cultivated fields in this selected area plot not included here from the time series plots in fig 9 we can identify time periods with lower probability values which translates to good trafficability conditions for the two cultivated fields this is observed in early spring around april of 2017 this also coincides with the timing of tillage for some fields in the netherlands for spring of 2016 however the trafficability conditions between these two cultivated fields vary for c1 soil moisture conditions indicate good trafficability while for c2 it is the opposite case the soil moisture in c2 did not decrease so the trafficability conditions did not improve over the spring period this difference may due to types of crops grown as well as how these fields were managed in previous years grass fields always appear to be trafficable given the threshold value used this is not the case for cultivated fields where there are more pronounced fluctuations in trafficable conditions however the results for grass fields may not always hold true especially for tractors with very heavy weights in principle these vehicles are legally allowed to reach up to 21 tons per axle eu regulation 167 2013 in contrast to our results for grass fields the soil may not be trafficable for very heavy vehicles during saturated conditions the threshold value we used may be a more reasonable indicator of trafficability using average tractor weights ranging from 6 8 tons these results could potentially be used by farmers and water managers alike for farmers the results can be used to identify periods suitable for traffic and to aid in deciding when to initiate tillage activities although in practice this might still be difficult to apply since farmers still need to work on their fields despite conditions unfavorable for traffic nevertheless the results can help in increasing awareness as to when soils are more susceptible to compaction for water managers the results could aid in their decisions to adjust water levels in channels and or canals in order to meet the water demands of farmers 5 conclusion in this paper we demonstrated how sentinel 1 can be used to monitor trafficability status in agricultural fields our findings show that by identifying coupled conditions satellite derived surface soil moisture can be directly related with cone index values since we focused only on soil moisture as the dominant temporal control expressing trafficability as probability values is advantageous because uncertainties are already incorporated however further attention should be given to the impacts of root growth as it may also act as a significant temporal control for cone index finally we showed that the high temporal resolution of sentinel 1 is suitable for tracking the changes in agricultural field trafficability however our results show that aggregation to coarser resolution may be necessary which may also preclude identifying the spatial variability within a field acknowledgements this work is part of the research programme optimizing water availability

yield organic carbon 1 introduction the task of increasing food production with less water particularly in semi arid regions of the world where rainfall is usually too scarce to meet the crop s demands has become a big challenge for the coming decades due to the serious water shortages geerts and raes 2009 irrigated areas have almost doubled lately and contributed much to the growth of agricultural productivity over the last 50 years nevertheless at present and more so in the future irrigated agriculture will take place under water scarcity fereres and connor 2004 therefore managing water supplies to enhance benefits for crop farming has become an increasingly important focus for semi arid regions water conservation is the best way to increase water management efficiency in agriculture and reduce potential negative environmental impacts irrigators can respond to limited water supplies by 1 reducing water uses and incurring deficits during all or part of the crop growing season 2 growing crops that match the water supply klocke et al 2010 the water requirement of a crop species or its genotype is an important trait that has immediate effect on growth nutrient dynamics and productivity of any agro ecosystem fereres and connor 2004 water requirement for corn is 600 700 mm for optimum growth and yield depending on the climatic conditions reddy 2006 high sensitivity of corn to water stress means that under water limiting conditions it is difficult to implement irrigation management strategies without incurring significant yield losses at any growth stage water

supply often have to choose among options such as fully irrigating a portion of the field area or changing to crops that require less water or retaining crop residue on soil surface crop residue have an important role as soil protecting factors and have been considered as an external input to protect soil organic matter and nutrient recycling gruber et al 2011 when maintained at sufficient rates crop residue can reduce the rate of water evaporation and runoff increase penetration of water and therefore soil water conservation is higher compared to soil with no residue mcaneney and arrúe 1993 the magnitude of the beneficial effects of the residues depends on rate of biomass produced by the crop klocke et al 2009 raper et al 2000 thus crop residue management is crucial to improve seedbed conditions especially in corn cropping after a crop with heavy residues such as irrigated wheat bahrani et al 2007 raoufat and matbooei 2007 if the rate of crop residues remained on soil is reduced to a certain rate they decompose and make nutrients available under relatively high temperatures accompanied by irrigation bahrani et al 2007 likewise incorporation of crop residues into the soil could increase soil water content govaerts et al 2007 sharma et al 2011 and improve water use efficiency zhang et al 2009 kazemeini et al 2014 found that incorporation of 25 wheat residue into the soil reduced the harmful effects of limited water supplies on corn growth and yield yaseen et al 2014 showed that the highest plant height 11 39 biological yield 29 56 and grain yield 35 5 were obtained with 711 2 mm of water and 15 mg ha 1 of wheat residue however there is no adequate information on crop residues and limited water application in corn cropping after wheat particularly in clayey soils of southern part of iran therefore more information on combined effects of irrigation regimes and crop residues incorporation into the soil on growth and yield of sweet corn and some soil properties is necessary in southern part of iran where irrigated wheat corn rotation is a common practice and wheat residues and water management are major problems and can give better understanding and would aid the development of water management strategies for the better water savings by reducing irrigation water use for little cost in yield and amending soil conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1

187 12 cm tillers number per m2 22 and leaf area index 3 49 were achieved when crop was normally irrigated 100 water requirement and sown into 25 wheat residue incorporated soil whereas growth attributes reduced 9 in response to increasing wheat residues incorporation and normal irrigation fig 1 a c according to correlation results a strongly correlation was found between plant height and leaf area index r2 0 81 in other words plant height increased as leaf area index increased table 3 the highest cob length 19 9 cm was obtained from 25 residue incorporation under normal irrigation however removing residue and severe stress 50 water requirement minimized cob length fig 1d thousand grain fresh weight 14 canned yield 68 fig 2 a and b harvest index 39 increased under100 water requirement when 25 residue incorporation was applied fig 3 c compared to the 50 wheat residue rate meanwhile the highest water use efficiency wue was obtained from moderate irrigation for 0 and 50 of the wheat residue rate fig 3c correlation results showed that canned yield changes were closely related to the 1000 grain fresh weight r2 0 99 plant height r2 0 72 and leaf area index r2 0 70 likewise a strongly correlation was found between canned yield and water use efficiency r2 0 84 table 3 grain protein content fig 2d and biological yield fig 3a increased with increased irrigation volume particularly under incorporation of 25 and 50 wheat residue incorporation into the soil furthermore the highest grain sugar content 26 44 mg 100g was obtained when the crop was moderately irrigated with 25 residue incorporation into the soil fig 2c there was an inverse relationship between grain protein and sugar content r2 0 71 for the interval of the irrigation regimes from 70 to 100 whereas the relation between the two variables was direct for the interval of the irrigation regimes of 50 to 70 fig 2c d 3 2 effects of treatments on soil properties the effects of irrigation regimes and wheat residue rates on soil properties were significant table 4 the highest soil n and soc was achieved with normal irrigation and 50 residue incorporation in both years while severe stress irrigation and no residue incorporation had the lowest soil n and organic c furthermore normal irrigation and 50 residue incorporation increased soil n and organic c 25 and 10 respectively in second year fig 4 linear regression results showed that canned yield gradually increased with increased soc r2 0 66 fig 5 a in other words canned yield increased 5 638 times by each unit of soc likewise increased soc increased grain protein content r2 0 76 fig 5b but grain sugar content decreased with increased soc to more than 1 fig 5c application of normal irrigation 100 water requirement accompanied by residue removal increased soil ec compared to 25 and 50 residue incorporation into the soil fig 6 a furthermore soil water content was significantly higher at normal irrigation compared to other irrigations regimes fig 6b however water content of soil increased with increased wheat residue incorporation rate 4 discussion the present study provided some information on combined effects of different irrigation regimes and wheat crop residue application to manage water resources toward maintaining corn production and amending soil conditions under water scarcity corn yields are influenced by a number of environmental factors such as growing season climate conditions water availability and soil conditions soil moisture status is important in maintaining optimal corn yields and maintaining optimal soil moisture is facilitated by irrigation ko and piccinni 2009 our results showed that limited water supply depend on its severity significantly decreased sweet corn growth and yield parameters fig 1 corn is a highly sensitive to drought limited water supply during the growing season results in soil and plant water deficits and reduces corn growth patel et al 2006 water deficit delays physiological processes of corn payero et al 2009 tasseling initiation and silking and reduces plant height and vegetation growth of corn singh et al 2007 resultingin grain yields decrease payero et al 2009 singh et al 2007 this agrees with the results of cakir 2004 who reported that water stress occurring during corn vegetative and tasselling stages reduced plant height as well as leaf area development approximately 28 32 kazemeini et al 2014 showed that water stress reduced the corn plant height leaf area index rows and grains per ear thousand grain weight grain and biological yield and harvest index furthermore corn yield and yield components significantly reduced with water stress fig 2 a and b in other words the reduction of corn yield probably accompanied by reduction of light interception and accelerating leaf senescence and consequently reduced photosynthetic rate and dry matter production igbadun et al 2007 yordanov et al 2000 furthermore water stress after tasseling initiation and silking increased floret sterility and or delay in tassels appearance kalamian et al 2006 our results showed that sugar and protein contents increased up to a certain irrigation volume and then decreased which agrees with ertek and kara 2013 it seems that plant water requirement remains insufficient for low irrigation volumes which affects nutrient transport and delays the development of stem and leaf cells causing shorter plants decreased leaf area sugar and protein contents and dry matter accumulation of the seeds andrade et al 2005 leading to early death of leaves due to food transfer from leaves imam and saqat al islam 2005 wue increased with increased irrigation volumes ertek and kara 2013 reported that corn fresh ear yields were significantly affected by water deficits low irrigation volumes decreased the ear yields however they showed that 30 deficit in water supply could be a water saving treatment without a significant decrease in yield kresović et al 2016 found that wue was the highest with a moderate water deficit while irrigation water use efficiency iwue was the highest with normal irrigation karam et al 2003 found higher and lower wue in water stressed and well watered plants respectively due to a larger decline in plant transpiration by reduction of green leaf area as a consequence of water stress yonts 2002 reported that reducing irrigation volume in dry bean phaseolus vulgaris by 25 increased iwue by 26 and only reduced 6 seed yield compared to full irrigation treatment scenario however applying only 50 of the crop evapotranspiration requirement etc significantly reduced seed yield 30 reduction in 5 out of 6 years compared to the full irrigation treatment p 0 05 retaining wheat crop residue on soil surface can lead to improved corn performance where water costs are high or supplies are limited likewise proper wheat residue incorporation into the soil can supply adequate nutrients and help to maintain soil water fang et al 2003 kazemeini et al 2014 found that the difference of corn growth parameters at four wheat residue rates varied under all irrigation treatments they found that the lowest differences of plant height and lai between all residues rates in normal water supply and the highest plant height and lai under severe water deficit it seems that corn growth was highly reduced by water deficit in no residues plots van donk et al 2010 found higher corn yield in residue covered plots compared to bare soil plots haghverdi et al 2017 reported higher sugar beet beta vulgaris l yield for residue covered than that bare soil plots previous studies also showed a positive impact of crop residue on yield components and wue kazemeini et al 2014 jin et al 2009 showed improvement of soil water holding capacity and corn water use efficiency by wheat residues incorporation into the soil respectively meanwhile wheat residue incorporation into the soil improved corn yield due to a higher availability of soil water powers et al 2004 additionally wheat residue incorporation into the soil increased soc fig 4 wheat residue incorporation into the soil plays an important role in increasing grain weight and attaining a reasonable yield under water deficit conditions by improving plant growth conditions such as increasing soc and nitrogen maintaining soil water by reducing evaporation from the soil surface and soil temperature reduction bahrani et al 2009 alijani et al 2012 indicated that wheat incorporated residue plots generally stored higher soc compared to removed ones it seems that leaving excessive crop residues on soil decreased sweet corn growth and yield even with normal irrigation which could be due to either changes in soil temperature or physical impediments to crop seedlings and poor crop establishment disease transmission and or n immobilization bahrani et al 2007 blanco canqui and lal 2009 rieger et al 2008 the positive effect of lower residue soil incorporated rates on crop yield is consistent with the findings of alijani et al 2012 and bahrani et al 2007 who found that that partial wheat residue incorporation resulted higher corn yield bahrani et al 2009 found the best growth of sunflower helianthus annuus l with 25 50 wheat residue incorporation rates 5 conclusions the results of this research showed that the sweet corn growth attributes up to 39 canned grain yield by 50 1000 grain fresh weight by 40 and cob length by 30 decreased when severe water stress 50 water requirement was applied on the contrary an improvement of soil properties and water holding capacity by incorporating 50 wheat residue into the soil increased crop growth and yield attributes up to 15 and 20 respectively this information can be helpful for the regional growers to save water in corn cultivation through adopting appropriate irrigation scheduling and proper wheat residue application under water shortage in general adopting an adequate rate of wheat residue between 25 50 residue accompanied by decreasing irrigation volume to 70 water requirement of corn is recommended in semi arid agroecosystems acknowledgment this

yield organic carbon 1 introduction the task of increasing food production with less water particularly in semi arid regions of the world where rainfall is usually too scarce to meet the crop s demands has become a big challenge for the coming decades due to the serious water shortages geerts and raes 2009 irrigated areas have almost doubled lately and contributed much to the growth of agricultural productivity over the last 50 years nevertheless at present and more so in the future irrigated agriculture will take place under water scarcity fereres and connor 2004 therefore managing water supplies to enhance benefits for crop farming has become an increasingly important focus for semi arid regions water conservation is the best way to increase water management efficiency in agriculture and reduce potential negative environmental impacts irrigators can respond to limited water supplies by 1 reducing water uses and incurring deficits during all or part of the crop growing season 2 growing crops that match the water supply klocke et al 2010 the water requirement of a crop species or its genotype is an important trait that has immediate effect on growth nutrient dynamics and productivity of any agro ecosystem fereres and connor 2004 water requirement for corn is 600 700 mm for optimum growth and yield depending on the climatic conditions reddy 2006 high sensitivity of corn to water stress means that under water limiting conditions it is difficult to implement irrigation management strategies without incurring significant yield losses at any growth stage water deficiency reduces growth and production of the corn crop paudyal 2001 it decreases leaf area pandey et al 2000 and plant height soler et al 2007 by reducing cell division and leaf expansion reymond et al 2003 it affects grain yield by reducing the active leaf area for photosynthesis najafinezhad et al 2014 kazemeini et al 2014 showed that water limitation by increasing irrigation intervals reduced plant height 14 6 leaf area index 12 9 rows 10 1 grains per ear 29 8 thousand grain weight 6 9 grain yield 33 8 biological yield 24 2 and harvest index 23 2 of corn farmers with limited water supply often have to choose among options such as fully irrigating a portion of the field area or changing to crops that require less water or retaining crop residue on soil surface crop residue have an important role as soil protecting factors and have been considered as an external input to protect soil organic matter and nutrient recycling gruber et al 2011 when maintained at sufficient rates crop residue can reduce the rate of water evaporation and runoff increase penetration of water and therefore soil water conservation is higher compared to soil with no residue mcaneney and arrúe 1993 the magnitude of the beneficial effects of the residues depends on rate of biomass produced by the crop klocke et al 2009 raper et al 2000 thus crop residue management is crucial to improve seedbed conditions especially in corn cropping after a crop with heavy residues such as irrigated wheat bahrani et al 2007 raoufat and matbooei 2007 if the rate of crop residues remained on soil is reduced to a certain rate they decompose and make nutrients available under relatively high temperatures accompanied by irrigation bahrani et al 2007 likewise incorporation of crop residues into the soil could increase soil water content govaerts et al 2007 sharma et al 2011 and improve water use efficiency zhang et al 2009 kazemeini et al 2014 found that incorporation of 25 wheat residue into the soil reduced the harmful effects of limited water supplies on corn growth and yield yaseen et al 2014 showed that the highest plant height 11 39 biological yield 29 56 and grain yield 35 5 were obtained with 711 2 mm of water and 15 mg ha 1 of wheat residue however there is no adequate information on crop residues and limited water application in corn cropping after wheat particularly in clayey soils of southern part of iran therefore more information on combined effects of irrigation regimes and crop residues incorporation into the soil on growth and yield of sweet corn and some soil properties is necessary in southern part of iran where irrigated wheat corn rotation is a common practice and wheat residues and water management are major problems and can give better understanding and would aid the development of water management strategies for the better water savings by reducing irrigation water use for little cost in yield and amending soil conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1

cultivar the average rate of irrigated wheat residues cover determined by random throwing of three 1 m 2 frames after harvesting was 5000 kg ha 1 in both years in order to establish the appropriate rate of residues based on each treatment excess residues were removed to establish specified treatment levels for example for the residue treatment 25 1250 kg ha 1 of pre tillage residues 5000 kg ha 1

yield components the effect of irrigation regimes wheat residue rates and their interaction on sweet corn growth and grain yield were significant however the residue did not have significant effect on tillers number per m2and harvest index in both years table 2 increased irrigation volume increased growth attributes and resulted different trends among wheat residue rates the highest plant height

a strongly correlation was found between canned yield and water use efficiency r2 0 84 table 3 grain protein content fig 2d and biological yield fig 3a increased with increased irrigation volume particularly under incorporation of 25 and 50 wheat residue incorporation into the soil furthermore the highest grain sugar content 26 44 mg 100g was obtained when the crop was moderately irrigated with 25 residue incorporation into the soil fig 2c there was an inverse relationship between grain protein and sugar content r2 0 71 for the interval of the irrigation regimes from 70 to 100 whereas the relation between the two variables was direct for the interval of the irrigation regimes of 50 to 70 fig 2c d 3 2 effects of treatments on soil properties the effects of irrigation regimes and wheat residue rates on soil properties were significant table 4 the highest soil n and soc was achieved with normal irrigation and 50 residue incorporation in both years while severe stress irrigation

linear regression results showed that canned yield gradually increased with increased soc r2 0 66 fig 5 a in other words canned yield increased 5 638 times by each unit of soc likewise increased soc increased grain protein content r2 0 76 fig 5b but grain sugar content decreased with increased soc to more than 1 fig 5c application of normal irrigation 100 water requirement accompanied by residue removal increased soil ec compared to 25 and 50 residue incorporation into the soil fig 6 a furthermore soil water content was significantly higher at normal irrigation compared to other irrigations regimes fig 6b however water content of soil increased with increased wheat residue incorporation rate 4 discussion the present study provided some information on combined effects of different irrigation regimes and wheat crop residue application to manage water resources toward maintaining corn production and amending soil conditions under water scarcity corn yields are influenced by a number of environmental factors such as growing season climate conditions water availability and soil conditions soil moisture status is important in maintaining optimal corn yields and maintaining optimal soil moisture is facilitated by irrigation ko and piccinni 2009 our results showed that limited water supply depend on its severity significantly decreased sweet corn growth and yield parameters fig 1 corn is a highly sensitive to drought limited water supply during the growing season results in soil and plant water deficits and reduces corn growth patel et al 2006 water deficit delays physiological processes of corn payero et al 2009 tasseling initiation and silking and reduces plant height and vegetation growth of corn singh et al 2007 resultingin grain yields decrease payero et al 2009 singh et al 2007 this agrees with the results of cakir 2004 who reported that water stress occurring during corn vegetative and tasselling stages reduced plant height as well as leaf area development approximately 28 32 kazemeini et al 2014 showed that water stress reduced the corn plant height leaf area index rows and grains per ear thousand grain weight grain and biological yield and harvest index furthermore corn yield and yield components significantly reduced with water stress fig 2 a and b in other words the reduction of corn yield probably accompanied by reduction of light interception and accelerating leaf senescence and consequently reduced photosynthetic rate and dry matter production igbadun et al 2007 yordanov et al 2000 furthermore water stress after tasseling initiation and silking increased floret sterility and or delay in tassels appearance kalamian et al 2006 our results showed that sugar and protein contents increased up to a certain irrigation volume and then decreased which agrees with ertek and kara 2013 it seems that plant water requirement remains insufficient for low irrigation volumes which affects nutrient transport and delays the development of stem and leaf cells causing shorter plants decreased leaf area sugar and protein contents and dry matter accumulation of the seeds andrade et al 2005 leading to early death of leaves due to food transfer from leaves imam and saqat al islam 2005 wue increased with increased irrigation volumes ertek and kara 2013 reported that corn fresh ear yields were significantly affected by water deficits low irrigation volumes decreased the ear yields however they showed that 30 deficit in water supply could be a water saving treatment without a significant decrease in yield kresović et al 2016 found that wue was the highest with a moderate water deficit while irrigation water use efficiency iwue was the highest with normal irrigation karam et al 2003 found higher and lower wue in water stressed and well watered plants respectively due to a larger decline in plant transpiration by reduction of green leaf area as a consequence of water stress yonts 2002 reported that reducing irrigation volume in dry bean phaseolus vulgaris by 25 increased iwue by 26 and only reduced 6 seed yield compared to full irrigation treatment scenario however applying only 50 of the crop evapotranspiration requirement etc significantly reduced seed yield 30 reduction in 5 out of 6 years compared to the full irrigation treatment p 0 05 retaining wheat crop residue on soil surface can lead to improved corn performance where water costs are high or supplies are limited likewise proper wheat residue incorporation into the soil can supply adequate nutrients and help to maintain soil water fang et al 2003 kazemeini et al 2014 found that the difference of corn growth parameters at four wheat residue rates varied under all irrigation treatments they found that the lowest differences of plant height and lai between all residues rates in normal water supply and the highest plant height and lai under severe water deficit it seems that corn growth was highly reduced by water deficit in no residues plots van donk et al 2010 found higher corn yield in residue covered plots compared to bare soil plots haghverdi et al 2017 reported higher sugar beet beta vulgaris l yield for residue covered than that bare soil plots previous studies also showed a positive impact of crop residue on yield components and wue kazemeini et al 2014 jin et al 2009 showed improvement of soil water holding capacity and corn water use efficiency by wheat residues incorporation into the soil respectively meanwhile wheat residue incorporation into the soil improved corn yield due to a higher availability of soil water powers et al 2004 additionally wheat residue incorporation into the soil increased soc fig 4 wheat residue incorporation into the soil plays an important role in increasing grain weight and attaining a reasonable yield under water deficit conditions by improving plant growth conditions such as increasing soc and nitrogen maintaining soil water by reducing evaporation from the soil surface and soil temperature reduction bahrani et al 2009 alijani et al 2012 indicated that wheat incorporated residue plots generally stored higher soc compared to removed ones it seems that leaving excessive crop residues on soil decreased sweet corn growth and yield even with normal irrigation which could be due to either changes in soil temperature or physical impediments to crop seedlings and poor crop establishment disease transmission and or n immobilization bahrani et al 2007 blanco canqui and lal 2009 rieger et al 2008 the positive effect of lower residue soil incorporated rates on crop yield is consistent with the findings of alijani et al 2012 and bahrani et al 2007 who found that that partial wheat residue incorporation resulted higher corn yield bahrani et al 2009 found the best growth of sunflower helianthus annuus l with 25 50 wheat residue incorporation rates 5 conclusions the results of this research showed that the sweet corn growth attributes up to 39 canned grain yield by 50 1000 grain fresh weight by 40 and cob length by 30 decreased when severe water stress 50 water requirement was applied on the contrary an improvement of soil properties and water holding capacity by incorporating 50 wheat residue into the soil increased crop growth and yield attributes up to 15 and 20 respectively this information can be helpful for the regional growers to save water in corn cultivation through adopting appropriate irrigation scheduling and proper wheat residue application under water shortage in general adopting an adequate rate of wheat residue between 25 50 residue accompanied by decreasing irrigation volume to 70 water requirement of corn is recommended in semi arid agroecosystems acknowledgment this

regulating root growth and lodging resistance the results showed that the rf system under different nutrient levels had significantly improved soil water storage yield components which led to promote the development of roots in deep soil 0 50 cm than that of sc and tf planting the rf2 treatment significantly increased the root volume density rvd root weight density rwd and root diameter at various growth stages and attained the maximum value at 125 dap except root diameter than that of tf2 treatment the root surface area density rsd and root length density rld were significantly increased in the upper 10 60 cm soil layer under the rf and sc cultivation patterns during silking and maturity stages than that of tf planting under different n levels however among the different treatments there was non significant variation in rsd and rld at below 70 cm soil profile the rf2 and sc2 considerably increased the root dry weight and the root bleeding sap during entire growth stages of maize crop than that of tf2 planting the rf system with different n levels delayed roots senescence in the later growth stage and the production was significantly increased compared with sc and tf planting compared with sc2 and tf2 treatment the rf2 treatment significantly increased the grain yield 5 7 t ha 1 104 and reduces root 79 and stem 95 lodging rate therefore rf2 cultivation method might be an appropriate water saving approach in semi arid regions keywords cultivation techniques root growth root bleeding sap root lodging soil water storage production 1 introduction semi arid areas of china

precipitation use efficiency gan et al 2013 this technique also improves the yield significantly zhou et al 2009 increasing nitrogen amount is an easy technique for achieving a maximum crop production gan et al 2008 however improved nitrogen amount leads to increased light nutrients moisture and space competition between corn plants fageria 2004 enhanced competition among the roots is mainly essential as they are the major organs that uptake nutrients and soil moisture zhang et al 2009 increased nitrogen level leads to increasing lodging risk ren et al 2008 and in semi arid regions

et al 2010 fahong et al 2004 in recent years the role of roots to increased crop production becomes an important study area in the dry land farming system hodge 2006 soil moisture contents enhance the accessibility of soil nutrients fahong et al 2004 whereas nutrients improve crop yield li et al 2009 the important determinant of water and nutrient absorption is the temporal and spatial root distribution qiu et al 2008 mosaddeghi et al 2009 reported that under plastic film improved nutrients and water uptake of root and its architecture thus it is essential to study the characteristics of root and how to reduce the lodging of corn under different cultivation techniques in combination of nutrient management in dry land farming regions in the dry land farming system have low rainfall soil erosion and high evaporation are important ecological hazards for maize yields xue et al 2003 hodge 2006 drought and poor soil fertility status is the main constrained in agricultural production in semi arid areas spedding et al 2004 rainwater loss and soil degradation are the complex physical process involving crop farming characteristics of precipitation and properties of soil qin et al 2005 the conventional flat planting cannot control rainwater loss and soil erosion during intense precipitation events as a result poor precipitation consumption therefore in the recent years research work on rooting systems and their relationship with soil moisture get more interest soil moisture improved the availability of nitrogen while nitrogen increase root development and lodging resistance spedding et al 2004 rate of root bleeding sap is a sign of the root pressure plant growing potential and root activity dahai et al 2014 given the difficulty of evaluating root systems in field trials root bleeding sap is helpful to learn root behavior especially nutrient and water uptake yuhong et al 2014 several research works reported that the plastic film mulching can encourage plant growth by considerably increasing biomass and water use efficiency then that of traditional planting wu et al 2015 mo et al 2017 but there were very few research studies on characteristics of root lodging resistance and maize production under different cultivation patterns in combination of nutrient strategies in the dry land farming system the aim of this field work was to ascertain the combined effect of nitrogen strategies and farming practices on enhancing production of maize through regulating root bleeding sap flow root distribution across the rooting zone and root lodging resistance

day before the time of sowing the whole phosphorus and potassium were applied at the rate of 50 and 30 kg ha 1 maize cultivar dafeng 30 at a rate of 75 000 plants ha 1 was sown on april 30 and may 1 during 2015 and 2016 study year with 60 cm an inter row distance the corn was harvested on september 20 and september 22 during 2015 and 2016 study year a 0 8 m wide space between adjacent plots was maintained to stop nutrient and water leakage during the two study years irrigation water was not supplied and weeds were control by hand 2 3 data collection from each plot the roots samples were collected at five times 25 50 75 100 and 125 dap during 2015 16 soil root columns were taken by using a soil auger with the internal diameter of the soil auger was 8 cm at each sampling time root samples were taken at three different positions including intra rows spots planting spots and intra plant in the rows each core was taken at 10 cm intervals down to 100 cm depth of the soil column the plastic containers filled with water and the soil core sections were soaked during the whole night next days soil sample was poured into mesh sieve 0 25 mm2 and gently washing of roots until the roots was washed free of soil according to gregory 1994 the live roots white color dead roots dark color and organic debris on the sieve were carefully separated from each soil core the root image was obtained by using a scanner epson v700 indonesia root images were analyzed by using the software winrhizo version 5 0 regent instruments inc quebec city canada the root surface area density and root length density were calculated according to li et al 2010 to get the constant root dry weight the root samples was drying at 105 c for 20 min and then dried at 75 c for 48 h the root dry weight density was calculated by dividing the root dry weight with the volume of sampling core the root volume density was calculated by dividing the root volume of the volume of the sampling core according to wang et al 2012 the root bleeding sap was measured with help of melioration in order to better adapt to the maize bleeding sap collection five plants were sampled at 25 50 75 100 and 125 days after planting dap where each plant was cut at an internode about 12 cm above the soil surface at 18 00 pm the finger cot was put on the upper end of the stalk and rubber band was used to ensure that the finger cot was firmly fastened to the stalk the other end of the rubber tube was plugged up with cotton the bleeding sap in the flask was collected the next morning at 6 00 am and the volume was measured the delivery rate was expressed as concentration per time unit per root according to yang et al 2002 moisture content was determined in the furrows at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 200 cm at the planting time seedling jointing flowering grain filling and harvesting stages from 2015 2016 moisture content at 20 cm intervals in 0 200 cm soil layers was recorded using a tdr meter time domain reflectometry trase system soil moisture equipment corp germany according to ren et al 2008 soil water storage sws at 200 cm soil depth was determined by the following formula 1 sws c ρ h 10 where c is the soil moisture ρ is the soil bulk density g cm 3 and h is the soil depth cm according to bian et al 2015 the center of gravity and ear height were find out by randomly selected five plants in each plot at the dough stages the ear height coefficient was taken as the ratio of ear height to plant height the center of gravity of each plant was study in the field all lodged plants per plot were calculated to find out the field lodging rate plants having more than 30 with straight and unbroken culms from the vertical axis were classified as root lodging and plants with broken stems were classified as stem lodging characteristics of ears including ear diameter mm ear length cm grain weight ear 1 grains ear 1 and 1000 grain weight g were measured on twenty plants randomly chosen from each plot at the end of each growing season from the middle of each plot the two rows of corn were hand harvested with four replications to determine the grain yield the grain yield was determined based on 12 seed water content for the total land area used including the combined area of the ridges and furrows 2 4 statistical analysis by using spss 18 0 software data from each sampling event

the flow of root bleeding in the rf and sc cultivation techniques in combination of 300 kg n ha 1 had non significantly variations were recorded 3 2 root length density rld and root surface area density rsd the rld and rsd are essential components across the rooting zone to provide nutrient and water uptake to corn the rld and rsd across the 0 100 cm soil depths were determined during 2015 2016 study years for the 2015 growing season the mean values of rld and rsd were not presented because there where non significant variations were found among the different treatments during both growing seasons at silking to maturity stage the rld was slowly decreased across the 0 100 cm soil layers the rld had been significant affected by rf3 planting but the differences between rf and sc treatments under different n fertilizer levels were no significant at various growth stages fig 5 at silking to maturity the rld at the soil depth of 0 10 cm showed clear variations among the different cultivation techniques in combination of n fertilizers levels however under rf3 treatment the highest rld was recorded followed by rf2 treatment than that of sc and tf treatments at various

influenced the root dry weight during both study years at various growth stages fig 8 in 2015 root dry weight under the rf3 and sc3 was significantly greater by 99 8 and 94 1 than that of tf0 treatment at 25 dap at 100 dap the maize crop attained the highest roots dry weight valve among the different cultivation techniques the rf system attained the highest root dry weight at 125 dap under the rf3 and sc3 treatments were achieved the maximum root dry weight by 74 7 and 70 8 compared with tf0 planting the root dry weight at 50 75 100 and 125 dap were significantly higher by 42 0 28 5 46 5 and 74 7 under the rf3 treatment as compared with tf3 treatment and sc3 treatments were maximum at 37 5 25 7 42 5 and 70 8 than that of tf3 treatment in 2016 similar varied trends of root dry weights were observed than that of 2015 study year the root dry weight under the rf and sc cultivation techniques with 300 kg n ha 1 had non significant variations were recorded during both years at entire growth stages of maize 3 4 root volume density rvd and root weight density rwd for the evaluation of roots characteristics the rvd and rwd are one of the most important parameters the rvd and rwd significantly affected by different cultivation techniques under nutrient management strategies and improve slowly with varying the maize growth stages fig 7 the rf model with 200 kg n ha 1 the rvd and rwd of maize considerably increased compared with tf planting at various growth stages after 25 dap there were major variations were noted among all the treatments from 50 to 100 dap under the rf and sc cultivation method with 300 to 200 kg n ha 1 the maize crop had significantly greater rvd and rwd as compared with tf planting at 50 75 100 and 125 dap rwd of rf3 treatment was higher at 70 0 32 1 90 6 and 32 3 then that of tf3 planting while the sc3 treatment were higher at 65 0 19 6 85 9 and 26 6 as compared with tf planting at 50 75 100 and 125 dap the rvd under the rf3 treatment was greater at 80 0 83 3 81 8 and 50 0 then that of tf planting and the sc3 treatment were higher at 60 0 66 7 63 6 and 37 5 as compared with sc3 treatment respectively 3 5 ear height eh ear height coefficient ehc and center of gravity cg the rf3 and rf2 treatments the eh and cg was significantly higher compared with sc and tf cultivation techniques during both study years table 1 nitrogen fertilizer level significantly improved the cg and eh and under the rf system significantly increased the ehc with 200 kg n ha 1 in 2015 16 in 2016 under the different cultivation techniques the eh was not significantly different among the same n fertilizer levels but in 2015 under the rf system the eh of 300 200 kg n ha 1 be considerably maximum than that of low n level under different cultivation techniques under the rf and sc cultivation techniques the ehc of high n level was considerably maximum compared with low n level as a result improves the maize lodging rate 3 6 stem lodging rate slr root lodging rate rlr total lodging rate tlr and root lodging total lodging rlr tlr the root lodging rates under the sc and tf cultivation techniques were significantly higher than that rf system at different n fertilizer levels during both study years table 1 the average of both year s shows that under rf and sc cultivation techniques the rlr decreased 25 5 and 16 1 times the slr decreased by 10 9 and 9 2 times and the tlr decreased 11 2 and 16 6 times then that of tf cultivation pattern respectively the results indicated that n fertilizer level improved the maize rlr corn lodging is more severe under the high n fertilizer level with tf planting than that of rf system the mean of both years data represents that under 200 300 kg n ha 1 the slr is increased 1 1 and 1 3 times compared with low n level the rlr is increased 6 4 and 8 3 times and the tlr is increased 7 5 and 9 2 times respectively the average of both year s shows that increasing the n fertilizer level considerably improved the maize lodging rate as a result directly affected maize productivity 3 7 yield components and maize production the results revealed that under the rf planting the production of corn was significantly improved by 33 8 whereas the sc cultivation technique considerably improved by 27 6 regardless of n rate then that of tf planting tables 1 and 2 the rf system produced maximum grain yield was always attended by a higher ear length ear diameter grains ear 1 grain weight ear 1 and thousand kernels weight the average data of two years indicated that under the rf2 treatment significantly improved grain yield by 2 3 t ha 1 while the sc2 treatment significantly improved by 2 0 t ha 1 than that of tf2 planting generally high n fertilizer levels with different cultivation techniques considerably improved maize production which was generally accompanied by a higher 1000 grains weight under the rf cultivation method the highest grain yield was regarded compared with sc and tf planting due to its higher yield components 1000 kernels weight and efficient rainwater utilization regardless of n fertilizer rates 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen strategies and farming practices effects on soil water storage and root distribution the rf planting is a consolidate strategy to applied in agriculture for better consumption of precipitation and improves soil water availability liu et al 2009 the rf planting has also been revealed to improve soil water content by better use of light rains and increasing moisture accessibility as a result encouraging plant growth gan et al 2008 however we find out that with plant development the maize water consumption rate significantly increased however moderate water stress was recording under the rf2 treatment as a result successful crop development at 80 dap the sws under rf2 treatment had considerably higher 5 7 compared with rf1 treatment under the different cultivation techniques as the nutrient levels increased the sws reduced during the entire growth stages the plastic film mulching with ridges and furrows has been shown to improve water availability to crop plants compared to traditional no ridge no plastic film mulching li et al 2001 also plastic mulching increases moisture in the topsoil and promotes stand establishment and plant growth liu et al 2009 however there is a lack of scientific information on how combined effect of nitrogen strategies and farming practices would affect crop root development across the rooting zones according to chenyang et al 2014 evaluation of root characteristics the rld and rsd are two pertinent parameters root development has a huge effect on the corn potential ability for uptake nutrient and water wang et al 2014 the rf planting with the n fertilizer level is an essential element for soil management which significantly influencing roots characteristics qin et al 2005 doussan et al 2006 confirmed that the rld and rsd are significantly increased under plastic film than that of tf planting at 5 cm depth the present outcome indicated that the rld and rsd are essential components across the rooting zone to provide nutrient and water uptake to corn at silking to maturity stage the rld was slowly decreased across the 0 100 cm soil layers the rld had been significant affected by rf3 treatment but the differences between rf and sc treatments under different n fertilizer levels were no significant at various growth stages fig 5 rf system with nutrient management strategies has improved uppermost soil structure and recycling nutrient in the root sharratt and gesch 2004 the rf system with medium n level increased soil moisture as a result increase rld and rsd which may significantly be related to changing in root growth and its distribution fageria 2004 similar outcome also find out by fang et al 2011 where reduces in irrigation amounts resulting reduction occurs in root and shoot growth the rld at the soil depth of 0 10 cm showed clear variations among the different cultivation techniques in combination of n fertilizers levels however under rf3 treatment the highest rld was recorded followed by rf2 treatment than that of sc and tf treatments at various n fertilizer levels at the 0 60 cm soil profiles these results indicated that under the rf3 and sc3 treatments delayed the senescence of roots in uppermost soil layer about 80 of the total root length is accumulated at the soil layer of 50 cm chen et al 2012 among the treatments at maturity stage the rld had non significant differences were recorded at the soil depths of 60 100 cm increasing the n fertilizer level lead to improve the competition between crop roots as a result roots to become thinner sharratt and gesch 2004 mosaddeghi et al 2009 reported that the rvd and rwd of corn at the 0 50 cm soil depths under the high n fertilizer level were decreased by 53 9 then that of low n fertilizer level in addition the improving rvd under the plastic film is possible due to enhanced soil physical chemical qualities yuhong et al 2014 in our study also get a similar outcome under the rf2 treatment the rvd and rwd of maize had been considerably maximum compared with tf planting at various growth stages at 50 100 dap under the rf2 and sc2 treatments the maize crop had significantly greater rvd and rwd as compared with tf planting this plastic film mulching with n fertilizer levels leads to improve water and nitrogen uptake as a result enhancing the rvd rwd and lateral root growth doussan et al 2006 4 2 nitrogen strategies and farming practices effects on root dry matter and root lodging resistance under rain fed condition root diameter and length are very essential morphological parameters which affected nutrient and water uptake materechera et al 1992 root diameter had an important effect on the roots capability to penetrate inside the soil chenyang et al 2014 and uptake more water in the deeper soil profiles we obtained similar results the cultivation techniques significantly affected the root diameter of maize plants under different n fertilizer levels fig 7 the root diameter in the early growth stage 25 50 dap gradually increasing in the middle growth stage 75 100 dap it s increased quickly and in the late growth stage 100 125 dap decreased slowly excluding tf planting plastic film mulching with n fertilizer levels can increase soil thermal conditions and soil water status liu et al 2013 eventually promoting root diameter and considerably enhance root biomass chenyang et al 2014 we found that the cultivation techniques in combination of different nutrient management strategies considerably influenced the root dry weight during both study years at various growth stages the root dry weight under the rf3 and sc3 treatments were significantly greater by 99 8 and 94 1 than that of tf0 treatment at 25 dap at 100 dap the maize crop attained the highest roots dry weight valve among the different cultivation techniques the rf system attained the highest root dry weight the root dry weight under the rf and sc cultivation techniques with 300 kg n ha 1 had non significant variations were recorded during both years at entire growth stages of maize the ear height coefficient ear height and center of gravity are directly correlated to root lodging jia et al 2018a b we found that under the rf3 and rf2 treatments the eh and cg was significantly higher compared with sc and tf cultivation techniques during both study years table 1 nitrogen fertilizer level significantly improved the cg and eh and under the rf system significantly increased the ehc with 200 kg n ha 1 in 2015 16 the rf3 was considerably maximum than that of low n level under different cultivation techniques under the rf and sc cultivation techniques the ehc of high n level was considerably higher compared with low n level as a result improves the maize lodging rate plant lodging can be divided into stalk and root lodging stalk lodging is caused by plant breakage kamara et al 2003 while root lodging is mainly due to the failure of the root anchorage gou et al 2008 under the sc and tf cultivation techniques the root lodging rates were significantly higher than that rf system at different n fertilizer levels during both study years table 1 the average of both year s shows that under rf and sc cultivation techniques the rlr decreased 25 5 and 16 1 times the slr decreased by 10 9 and 9 2 times and the tlr decreased 11 2 and 16 6 times compared with those under tf cultivation pattern the mean of both years data represents that under 200 to 300 kg n ha 1 the slr is increased 1 1 and 1 3 times compared with low n level the rlr is increased 6 4 and 8 3 times and the tlr is increased 7 5 and 9 2 times respectively the average of both year s shows that increasing the n fertilizer level considerably improved the maize lodging rate as a result directly affected maize productivity this outcome was consistent with li et al 2015 the rlr and slr increased with increasing n fertilizer levels the negative effects of slr on yield were maximum compared with rlr the yield relative loss rate of slr was 45 to 48 and that of the rlr was 29 to 38 liu et al 2012a 4 3 root bleeding sap and maize production responses to different nitrogen strategies and farming practices the xylem sap had been studied primarily to elucidate the transfer mechanism of substances from roots to shoots ansari et al 2004 the root bleeding is directly correlated to active water absorption in the root system and its reveal the physiological root activity morita et al 2000 ansari et al 2004 reported the positive correlation ship between the root bleeding rate and the root growth the variation in the slr among the different cultivation techniques might depend on the variation in stem size linked with root traits noguchi et al 2005 the root bleeding sap is directly correlated to water and nutrient uptake ansari et al 2004 we found that at the 50 and 75 dap under the rf3 treatment showed significantly maximum flow of root bleeding flow than that of sc3 and tf3 cultivation techniques at 25 100 and 125 dap under the rf2 and sc2 treatments the rate of root bleeding sap had no significantly difference than that of tf2 treatment at different n fertilizer levels the flow of root bleeding under rf and sc with 300 kg n ha 1 had non significantly variations were recorded the plastic film in combination of medium n fertilizer level effectively used light rain thus raising the water accessibility to crops with a higher root bleeding sap and production ali et al 2018 according to noguchi et al 2005 the nutrient contents in the xylem sap are similarly representative of the nutritional status of the plant and the soil compaction effects on root absorption of nutrients manzur et al 2014 confirmed that n application with plastic film mulching increased the corn production and reduced the et rate liu et al 2012a study that when the nutrients away from a threshold value so no further increase in yield was recorded we also found that under the rf system the maize production was considerably improved by 33 8 while the sc significantly increased 27 6 regardless of n rate then that of tf planting tables 1 and 2 generally high n fertilizer levels with different cultivation techniques considerably improved maize production which was generally accompanied by a higher 1000 grains weight under the plastic film the highest grain yield was regarded than that of sc and tf planting due to its higher production and efficient precipitation consumption the rwd rvd rsd rld rd and rl tl have significantly positive correlation with production of maize table 3 and as a result the encouragement of root growth might be the key approach to develop corn root resistance and improve production therefore the rf2 cultivation method might be an appropriate water saving approach because this approach can delay roots senescence and improving lodging resistance and maize production 5 conclusions the findings of this research indicate that the rf system under different nutrient management strategies had significantly improved soil water storage yield components which led to promote the development of roots in deep soil than that of sc and tf planting however certain farming management practices such as rf significantly enhanced maize production through greater grains per ear and 1000 grain weight compared with sc and tf which led to greater sws the rf2 treatment significantly improved the rvd rwd and root diameter at various growth stages and attained the maximum value at 125 dap except root diameter compared with tf2 treatment at silking and maturity stages under the rf and sc cultivation patterns the rsd and rld were higher than the soil depth of 10 60 cm compared with tf planting under different n levels however among the different treatments there was non significant variation in rsd and rld at below a soil layer of 70 cm the rf2 and sc2 considerably increased the root dry weight and the root bleeding sap during entire growth stages of maize crop than that of tf2 planting the rf system with different n levels delayed roots senescence in the later growth stage and the production was significantly increased compared with sc and tf cultivation techniques compared with sc and tf cultivation patterns with medium n level the rf system considerably improved the crop yields and reduces root and stem lodging rate we conclude that rf2 cultivation method is an effective sustainable system for maize production in arid and semi arid areas due to the improved rooting systems and enhanced sws across the rooting zones for along run the using of rf2 cultivation method might be an appropriate water saving approach because this approach can delay roots senescence and improving lodging resistance and a viable tool in reducing maize production risks in semi arid areas

the upper 10 60 cm soil layer under the rf and sc cultivation patterns during silking and maturity stages than that of tf planting under different n levels however among the different treatments there was non significant variation in rsd and rld at below 70 cm soil profile the rf2 and sc2 considerably increased the root dry weight and the root bleeding sap during entire growth stages of maize crop than that of tf2 planting the rf system with different n levels delayed roots senescence in the later growth stage and the production was significantly increased compared with sc and tf planting compared with sc2 and tf2 treatment the rf2 treatment significantly increased the grain yield 5 7 t ha 1 104 and reduces root 79 and stem 95 lodging rate therefore rf2 cultivation method might be an

wang et al 2011b the plastic film is one of the mainly efficient cultivation techniques which effectively collected precipitation and reduced soil evaporation improved soil water penetration lodging resistance and maize production li et al 2010 coupled with ridges furrows planting patterns film mulching can channel rainwater effectively to the crop rooting zones and thereby improving precipitation use efficiency gan et al 2013 this technique also improves the yield significantly zhou et al 2009 increasing nitrogen amount is an easy technique for achieving a maximum crop production gan et al 2008 however improved nitrogen amount leads to increased light nutrients moisture and space competition between corn plants fageria 2004 enhanced competition among the roots is mainly essential as they are the major organs that uptake nutrients and soil moisture zhang et al 2009 increased nitrogen level leads to increasing lodging risk ren et al 2008 and in semi arid regions lodging is one of the key factors of declined maize production palta et al 2007 premature senescence and lodging are directly correlated to root growth of maize zhao et al 2013a b research on the root is one of the key factors in semi arid regions to increase production and reduce lodging spedding et al 2004 plant roots are a fundamental component of terrestrial ecosystems and function to maintain the supply of nutrients and water to the plant lynch 2011 moreover the above ground growth and biomass yield is greatly dependent on the root system and root development and distribution in the soil profile determine the capacity for nutrient uptake and water extraction by crop plants hammer et al 2009 the characteristic of root is essential to optimizing corn yield because root growth and its distribution significantly influence on uptake of nutrients and soil moisture jia et al 2018b which directly affected crop growth and development li et al 2010 the basic part of plant soil ecosystem is plant roots and its function to provide water and nutrients to the plant jia et al 2018a to regulate root growth and its effect to enhance maize production are urgently needed in the dry land farming system spedding et al 2004 lynch 2011 the functions of the crop root system are to increase the root absorption capacity water and nutrients interception as a resulting to increasing yields ma et al 2010 fahong et al 2004 in recent years the role of roots to increased crop production becomes an important study area in the dry land farming system hodge 2006 soil moisture contents enhance the accessibility of soil nutrients fahong et al 2004 whereas nutrients improve crop yield li et al 2009 the important determinant of water and nutrient absorption is the temporal and spatial root distribution qiu et al 2008 mosaddeghi et al 2009 reported that under plastic film improved nutrients and water uptake of root and its architecture thus it is essential to study the characteristics of root and how to reduce the lodging of corn under different cultivation techniques in combination of nutrient management in dry land farming regions in the dry land farming system have low rainfall soil erosion and high evaporation are important ecological hazards for maize yields xue et al 2003 hodge 2006 drought and poor soil fertility status is the main constrained in agricultural production in semi arid areas spedding et al 2004 rainwater loss and soil degradation are the complex physical process involving crop farming characteristics of precipitation and properties of soil qin et al 2005 the conventional flat planting cannot control rainwater loss and soil erosion during intense precipitation events as a result poor precipitation consumption therefore in the recent years research work on rooting systems and their relationship with soil moisture get more interest soil moisture improved the availability of nitrogen while nitrogen increase root development and lodging resistance spedding et al 2004 rate of root bleeding sap is a sign of the root pressure plant growing potential and root activity dahai et al 2014 given the difficulty of evaluating root systems in field trials root bleeding sap is helpful to learn root behavior especially nutrient and water uptake yuhong et al 2014 several research works reported that the plastic film mulching can encourage plant growth by considerably increasing biomass and water use efficiency then that of traditional planting wu et al 2015 mo et al 2017 but there were very few research studies on characteristics of root lodging resistance and maize production under different cultivation patterns in combination of nutrient strategies in the dry land farming system the aim of this field work was to ascertain the combined effect of nitrogen strategies and farming practices on enhancing production of maize through regulating root bleeding sap flow root distribution across the rooting zone and root lodging resistance under semi arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this field trail was carried out during 2015 2016 years at the huan county eastern gansu province north west china which is located

day before the time of sowing the whole phosphorus and potassium were applied at the rate of 50 and 30 kg ha 1 maize cultivar dafeng 30 at a rate of 75 000 plants ha 1 was sown on april 30 and may 1 during 2015 and 2016 study year with 60 cm an inter row distance the corn was harvested on september 20 and september 22 during 2015 and 2016 study year a 0 8 m wide space between adjacent plots was maintained to stop nutrient and water leakage during the two study years irrigation water was not supplied and weeds were control by hand 2 3 data collection from each plot the roots samples were collected at five times 25 50 75 100 and 125 dap during 2015 16 soil root columns were taken by using a soil auger with the internal diameter of the soil auger was 8 cm at each sampling time root samples were taken at three different positions including intra rows spots planting spots and intra plant in the rows each core was taken at 10 cm intervals down to 100 cm depth of the soil column the plastic containers filled with water and the soil core sections were soaked during the whole night next days soil sample was poured into mesh sieve 0 25 mm2 and gently washing of roots until the roots was washed free of soil according to gregory 1994 the live roots white color dead roots dark color and organic debris on the sieve were carefully separated from each soil core the root image was obtained by using a scanner epson v700 indonesia root images were analyzed by using the software winrhizo version 5 0 regent instruments inc quebec city canada the root surface area density and root length density were calculated according to li et al 2010 to get the constant root dry weight the root samples was drying at 105 c for 20 min and then dried at 75 c for 48 h the root dry weight density was calculated by dividing the root dry weight with the volume of sampling core the root volume density was calculated by dividing the root volume of the volume of the sampling core according to wang et al 2012 the root bleeding sap was measured with help of melioration in order to better adapt to the maize bleeding sap collection five plants were sampled at 25 50 75 100 and 125 days after planting dap where each plant was cut at an internode about 12 cm above the soil surface at 18 00 pm the finger cot was put on the upper end of the stalk and rubber band was used to ensure that the finger cot was firmly fastened to the stalk the other end of the rubber tube was plugged up with cotton the bleeding sap in the flask was collected the next morning at 6 00 am and the volume was measured the delivery rate was expressed as concentration per time unit per root according to yang et al 2002 moisture content was determined in the furrows at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 200 cm at the planting time seedling jointing flowering grain filling and harvesting stages from 2015 2016 moisture content at 20 cm intervals in 0 200 cm soil layers was recorded using a tdr meter time domain reflectometry trase system soil moisture equipment corp germany according to ren et al 2008 soil water storage sws at 200 cm soil depth was determined by the following formula 1 sws c ρ h 10 where c is the soil moisture ρ is the soil bulk density g cm 3 and h is the soil depth cm according to bian et al 2015 the center of gravity and ear height were find out by randomly selected five plants in each plot at the dough stages the ear height coefficient was taken as the ratio of ear height to plant height the center of gravity of each plant was study in the field all lodged plants per plot were calculated to find out the field lodging rate plants having more than 30 with straight and unbroken culms from the vertical axis were classified as root lodging and plants with broken stems were classified as stem lodging characteristics of ears including ear diameter mm ear length cm grain weight ear 1 grains ear 1 and 1000 grain weight g were measured on twenty plants randomly chosen from each plot at the end of each growing season from the middle of each plot the two rows of corn were hand harvested with four replications to determine the grain yield the grain yield was determined based on 12 seed water content for the total land area used including the combined area of the ridges and furrows 2 4 statistical analysis by using spss 18 0 software data from each sampling event were analyzed separately by anvoa test means among treatments were compared based on the least significant differences test lsd p 0 05 the variations in rsd rld rvd rwd and root diameter between both

the flow of root bleeding in the rf and sc cultivation techniques in combination of 300 kg n ha 1 had non significantly variations were recorded 3 2 root length density rld and root surface area density rsd the rld and rsd are essential components across the rooting zone to provide nutrient and water uptake to corn the rld and rsd across the 0 100 cm soil depths were determined during 2015 2016 study years for the 2015 growing season the mean values of rld and rsd were not presented because there where non significant variations were found among the different treatments during both growing seasons at silking to maturity stage the rld was slowly decreased across the 0 100 cm soil layers the rld had been significant affected by rf3 planting but the differences between rf and sc treatments under different n fertilizer levels were no significant at various growth stages fig 5 at silking to maturity the rld at the soil depth of 0 10 cm showed clear variations among the different cultivation techniques in combination of n fertilizers levels however under rf3 treatment the highest rld was recorded followed by rf2 treatment than that of sc and tf treatments at various

with tf3 planting while the rsd across the soil depths 30 50 cm was significantly lower as compared with tf3 planting at the silking stage fig 6 at the maturity stage at different cultivation techniques with a high n fertilizer level the rsd was significantly maximum across the 0 30 cm soil layers as compared with tf3 planting but no variation was recorded across the 40 100 cm soil layers the rf and sc cultivation techniques with 200 300 kg n ha 1 the rsd a at the soil depth of 0 30 cm was considerably higher as compared with tf planting while non significant variation was recorded under low n fertilizer level these results indicated that under the rf3 and sc3 treatments delayed the senescence of roots in uppermost soil profile 3 3 root diameter cm and root dry weight g per plant cultivation techniques significantly affected the root diameter of maize plants under different n fertilizer levels fig 7 the root diameter of maize in the early growth stage 25 50 dap gradually increasing in the middle growth stage 75 100 dap it s increased quickly and in the late growth stage 100 125 dap decreased slowly excluding tf model under the rf3 treatment the root diameters of maize were significantly higher by 36 4 72 7 66 7 99 3 and 53 3 at 25 50 75 100 and 125 dap compared with tf0 cultivation method roots of corn under the sc3 treatment were 31 6 higher diameter at 25 dap 63 6 58 3 91 7 and 46 7 higher at 25 50 75 100 and 125 dap respectively compared to tf0 planting the cultivation techniques in combination of different nutrient management strategies considerably influenced the root dry weight during both study years at various growth stages fig 8 in 2015 root dry weight under the rf3 and sc3 was significantly greater by 99 8 and 94 1 than that of tf0 treatment at 25 dap at 100 dap the maize crop attained the highest roots dry weight valve among the different cultivation techniques the rf system attained the highest root dry weight at 125 dap under the rf3 and sc3 treatments were achieved the maximum root dry weight by 74 7 and 70 8 compared with tf0 planting the root dry weight at 50 75 100 and 125 dap were significantly higher by 42 0 28 5 46 5 and 74 7 under the rf3 treatment as compared with tf3 treatment and sc3 treatments were maximum at 37 5 25 7 42 5 and 70 8 than that of tf3 treatment in 2016 similar varied trends of root dry weights were observed than that of 2015 study year the root dry weight under the rf and sc cultivation techniques with 300 kg n ha 1 had non significant variations were recorded during both years at entire growth stages of maize 3 4 root volume density rvd and root weight density rwd for the evaluation of roots characteristics the rvd and rwd are one of the most important parameters the rvd and rwd significantly affected by different cultivation techniques under nutrient management strategies and improve slowly with varying the maize growth stages fig 7 the rf model with 200 kg n ha 1 the rvd and rwd of maize considerably increased compared with tf planting at various growth stages after 25 dap there were major variations were noted among all the treatments from 50 to 100 dap under the rf and sc cultivation method with 300 to 200 kg n ha 1 the maize crop had significantly greater rvd and rwd as compared with tf planting at 50 75 100 and 125 dap rwd of rf3 treatment was higher at 70 0 32 1 90 6 and 32 3 then that of tf3 planting while the sc3 treatment were higher at 65 0 19 6 85 9 and 26 6 as compared with tf planting at 50 75 100 and 125 dap the rvd under the rf3 treatment was greater at 80 0 83 3 81 8 and 50 0 then that of tf planting and the sc3 treatment were higher at 60 0 66 7 63 6 and 37 5 as compared with sc3 treatment respectively 3 5 ear height eh ear height coefficient ehc and center of gravity cg the rf3 and rf2 treatments the eh and cg was significantly higher compared with sc and tf cultivation techniques during both study years table 1 nitrogen fertilizer level significantly improved the cg and eh and under the rf system significantly increased the ehc with 200 kg n ha 1 in 2015 16 in 2016 under the different cultivation techniques the eh was not significantly different among the same n fertilizer levels but in 2015 under the rf system the eh of 300 200 kg n ha 1 be considerably maximum than that of low n level under different cultivation techniques under the rf and sc cultivation techniques the ehc of high n level was considerably maximum compared with low n level as a result improves the maize lodging rate 3 6 stem lodging rate slr root lodging rate rlr total lodging rate tlr and root lodging total lodging rlr tlr the root lodging rates under the sc and tf cultivation techniques were significantly higher than that rf system at different n fertilizer levels during both study years table 1 the average of both year s shows that under rf and sc cultivation techniques the rlr decreased 25 5 and 16 1 times the slr decreased by 10 9 and 9 2 times and the tlr decreased 11 2 and 16 6 times then that of tf cultivation pattern respectively the results indicated that n fertilizer level improved the maize rlr corn lodging is more severe under the high n fertilizer level with tf planting than that of rf system the mean of both years data represents that under 200 300 kg n ha 1 the slr is increased 1 1 and 1 3 times compared with low n level the rlr is increased 6 4 and 8 3 times and the tlr is increased 7 5 and 9 2 times respectively the average of both year s shows that increasing the n fertilizer level considerably improved the maize lodging rate as a result directly affected maize productivity 3 7 yield components and maize production the results revealed that under the rf planting the production of corn was significantly improved by 33 8 whereas the sc cultivation technique considerably improved by 27 6 regardless of n rate then that of tf planting tables 1 and 2 the rf system produced maximum grain yield was always attended by a higher ear length ear diameter grains ear 1 grain weight ear 1 and thousand kernels weight the average data of two years indicated that under the rf2 treatment significantly improved grain yield by 2 3 t ha 1 while the sc2 treatment significantly improved by 2 0 t ha 1 than that of tf2 planting generally high n fertilizer levels with different cultivation techniques considerably improved maize production which was generally accompanied by a higher 1000 grains weight under the rf cultivation method the highest grain yield was regarded compared with sc and tf planting due to its higher yield components 1000 kernels weight and efficient rainwater utilization regardless of n fertilizer rates 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen strategies and farming practices effects on soil water storage and root distribution the rf planting is a consolidate strategy to applied in agriculture for better consumption of precipitation and improves soil water availability liu et al 2009 the rf planting has also been revealed to improve soil water content by better use of light rains and increasing moisture accessibility as a result encouraging plant growth gan et al 2008 however we find out that with plant development the maize water consumption rate significantly increased however moderate water stress was recording under the rf2 treatment as a result successful crop development at 80 dap the sws under rf2 treatment had considerably higher 5 7 compared with rf1 treatment under the different cultivation techniques as the nutrient levels increased the sws reduced during the entire growth stages the plastic film mulching with ridges and furrows has been shown to improve water availability to crop plants compared to traditional no ridge no plastic film mulching li et al 2001 also plastic mulching increases moisture in the topsoil and promotes stand establishment and plant growth liu et al 2009 however there is a lack of scientific information on how combined effect of nitrogen strategies and farming practices would affect crop root development across the rooting zones according to chenyang et al 2014 evaluation of root characteristics the rld and rsd are two pertinent parameters root development has a huge effect on the corn potential ability for uptake nutrient and water wang et al 2014 the rf planting with the n fertilizer level is an essential element for soil management which significantly influencing roots characteristics qin et al 2005 doussan et al 2006 confirmed that the rld and rsd are significantly increased under plastic film than that of tf planting at 5 cm depth the present outcome indicated that the rld and rsd are essential components across the rooting zone to provide nutrient and water uptake to corn at silking to maturity stage the rld was slowly decreased across the 0 100 cm soil layers the rld had been significant affected by rf3 treatment but the differences between rf and sc treatments under different n fertilizer levels were no significant at various growth stages fig 5 rf system with nutrient management strategies has improved uppermost soil structure and recycling nutrient in the root sharratt and gesch 2004 the rf system with medium n level increased soil moisture as a result increase rld and rsd which may significantly be related to changing in root growth and its distribution fageria 2004 similar outcome also find out by fang et al 2011 where reduces in irrigation amounts resulting reduction occurs in root and shoot growth the rld at the soil depth of 0 10 cm showed clear variations among the different cultivation techniques in combination of n fertilizers levels however under rf3 treatment the highest rld was recorded followed by rf2 treatment than that of sc and tf treatments at various n fertilizer levels at the 0 60 cm soil profiles these results indicated that under the rf3 and sc3 treatments delayed the senescence of roots in uppermost soil layer about 80 of the total root length is accumulated at the soil layer of 50 cm chen et al 2012 among the treatments at maturity stage the rld had non significant differences were recorded at the soil depths of 60 100 cm increasing the n fertilizer level lead to improve the competition between crop roots as a result roots to become thinner sharratt and gesch 2004 mosaddeghi et al 2009 reported that the rvd and rwd of corn at the 0 50 cm soil depths under the high n fertilizer level were decreased by 53 9 then that of low n fertilizer level in addition the improving rvd under the plastic film is possible due to enhanced soil physical chemical qualities yuhong et al 2014 in our study also get a similar outcome under the rf2 treatment the rvd and rwd of maize had been considerably maximum compared with tf planting at various growth stages at 50 100 dap under the rf2 and sc2 treatments the maize crop had significantly greater rvd and rwd as compared with tf planting this plastic film mulching with n fertilizer levels leads to improve water and nitrogen uptake as a result enhancing the rvd rwd and lateral root growth doussan et al 2006 4 2 nitrogen strategies and farming practices effects on root dry matter and root lodging resistance under rain fed condition root diameter and length are very essential morphological parameters which affected nutrient and water uptake materechera et al 1992 root diameter had an important effect on the roots capability to penetrate inside the soil chenyang et al 2014 and uptake more water in the deeper soil profiles we obtained similar results the cultivation techniques significantly affected the root diameter of maize plants under different n fertilizer levels fig 7 the root diameter in the early growth stage 25 50 dap gradually increasing in the middle growth stage 75 100 dap it s increased quickly and in the late growth stage 100 125 dap decreased slowly excluding tf planting plastic film mulching with n fertilizer levels can increase soil thermal conditions and soil water status liu et al 2013 eventually promoting root diameter and considerably enhance root biomass chenyang et al 2014 we found that the cultivation techniques in combination of different nutrient management strategies considerably influenced the root dry weight during both study years at various growth stages the root dry weight under the rf3 and sc3 treatments were significantly greater by 99 8 and 94 1 than that of tf0 treatment at 25 dap at 100 dap the maize crop attained the highest roots dry weight valve among the different cultivation techniques the rf system attained the highest root dry weight the root dry weight under the rf and sc cultivation techniques with 300 kg n ha 1 had non significant variations were recorded during both years at entire growth stages of maize the ear height coefficient ear height and center of gravity are directly correlated to root lodging jia et al 2018a b we found that under the rf3 and rf2 treatments the eh and cg was significantly higher compared with sc and tf cultivation techniques during both study years table 1 nitrogen fertilizer level significantly improved the cg and eh and under the rf system significantly increased the ehc with 200 kg n ha 1 in 2015 16 the rf3 was considerably maximum than that of low n level under different cultivation techniques under the rf and sc cultivation techniques the ehc of high n level was considerably higher compared with low n level as a result improves the maize lodging rate plant lodging can be divided into stalk and root lodging stalk lodging is caused by plant breakage kamara et al 2003 while root lodging is mainly due to the failure of the root anchorage gou et al 2008 under the sc and tf cultivation techniques the root lodging rates were significantly higher than that rf system at different n fertilizer levels during both study years table 1 the average of both year s shows that under rf and sc cultivation techniques the rlr decreased 25 5 and 16 1 times the slr decreased by 10 9 and 9 2 times and the tlr decreased 11 2 and 16 6 times compared with those under tf cultivation pattern the mean of both years data represents that under 200 to 300 kg n ha 1 the slr is increased 1 1 and 1 3 times compared with low n level the rlr is increased 6 4 and 8 3 times and the tlr is increased 7 5 and 9 2 times respectively the average of both year s shows that increasing the n fertilizer level considerably improved the maize lodging rate as a result directly affected maize productivity this outcome was consistent with li et al 2015 the rlr and slr increased with increasing n fertilizer levels the negative effects of slr on yield were maximum compared with rlr the yield relative loss rate of slr was 45 to 48 and that of the rlr was 29 to 38 liu et al 2012a 4 3 root bleeding sap and maize production responses to different nitrogen strategies and farming practices the xylem sap had been studied primarily to elucidate the transfer mechanism of substances from roots to shoots ansari et al 2004 the root bleeding is directly correlated to active water absorption in the root system and its reveal the physiological root activity morita et al 2000 ansari et al 2004 reported the positive correlation ship between the root bleeding rate and the root growth the variation in the slr among the different cultivation techniques might depend on the variation in stem size linked with root traits noguchi et al 2005 the root bleeding sap is directly correlated to water and nutrient uptake ansari et al 2004 we found that at the 50 and 75 dap under the rf3 treatment showed significantly maximum flow of root bleeding flow than that of sc3 and tf3 cultivation techniques at 25 100 and 125 dap under the rf2 and sc2 treatments the rate of root bleeding sap had no significantly difference than that of tf2 treatment at different n fertilizer levels the flow of root bleeding under rf and sc with 300 kg n ha 1 had non significantly variations were recorded the plastic film in combination of medium n fertilizer level effectively used light rain thus raising the water accessibility to crops with a higher root bleeding sap and production ali et al 2018 according to noguchi et al 2005 the nutrient contents in the xylem sap are similarly representative of the nutritional status of the plant and the soil compaction effects on root absorption of nutrients manzur et al 2014 confirmed that n application with plastic film mulching increased the corn production and reduced the et rate liu et al 2012a study that when the nutrients away from a threshold value so no further increase in yield was recorded we also found that under the rf system the maize production was considerably improved by 33 8 while the sc significantly increased 27 6 regardless of n rate then that of tf planting tables 1 and 2 generally high n fertilizer levels with different cultivation techniques considerably improved maize production which was generally accompanied by a higher 1000 grains weight under the plastic film the highest grain yield was regarded than that of sc and tf planting due to its higher production and efficient precipitation consumption the rwd rvd rsd rld rd and rl tl have significantly positive correlation with production of maize table 3 and as a result the encouragement of root growth might be the key approach to develop corn root resistance and improve production therefore the rf2 cultivation method might be an appropriate water saving approach because this approach can delay roots senescence and improving lodging resistance and maize production 5 conclusions the findings of this research indicate that the rf system under different nutrient management strategies had significantly improved soil water storage yield components which led to promote the development of roots in deep soil than that of sc and tf planting however certain farming management practices such as rf significantly enhanced maize production through greater grains per ear and 1000 grain weight compared with sc and tf which led to greater sws the rf2 treatment significantly improved the rvd rwd and root diameter at various growth stages and attained the maximum value at 125 dap except root diameter compared with tf2 treatment at silking and maturity stages under the rf and sc cultivation patterns the rsd and rld were higher than the soil depth of 10 60 cm compared with tf planting under different n levels however among the different treatments there was non significant variation in rsd and rld at below a soil layer of 70 cm the rf2 and sc2 considerably increased the root dry weight and the root bleeding sap during entire growth stages of maize crop than that of tf2 planting the rf system with different n levels delayed roots senescence in the later growth stage and the production was significantly increased compared with sc and tf cultivation techniques compared with sc and tf cultivation patterns with medium n level the rf system considerably improved the crop yields and reduces root and stem lodging rate we conclude that rf2 cultivation method is an effective sustainable system for maize production in arid and semi arid areas due to the improved rooting systems and enhanced sws across the rooting zones for along run the using of rf2 cultivation method might be an appropriate water saving approach because this approach can delay roots senescence and improving lodging resistance and a viable tool in reducing maize production risks in semi arid areas
