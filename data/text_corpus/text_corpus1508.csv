1950s by forrester at the massachusetts institute of technology the key idea underlying this approach is the notion that complex phenomena can be better understood by examining the behavior of the system and how it changes over time forrester applied the method of system analysis which is frequently used in engineering to dynamically analyze systems in the fields of business administration and social science in his book industrial dynamics forrester 1961 forrester analyzed corporate activity and in urban dynamics forrester 1966 he applied sd analysis to urban planning forrester developed sd into a mature simulation tool that can represent large scale social systems the development of sd models to analyze problems and identify solutions for improved water resource management has a long history the stanford watershed model built by crawford and linsley in 1966 is commonly credited as being the first comprehensive watershed simulation model developed shortly after the emergence of the sd model forrester 1958 the use of sd as a tool for integrated regional analysis has been a continuing research focus rouwette and vennix 2006 generally sd offers an effective tool for simulating and analyzing complex systems with various interrelated factors and has a wide range of applications liu et al 2002 if researchers want to analyze an environmental issue with sd they can build a model that includes factors related to ecosystem and human activities focusing on the flows of the indicator substances such as co2 which is a causative factor in global warming by operating this model under sd they can find the relationships between factors and the flows of indicators through both numerical results and graphical visualization in addition sd modeling can aide in decision making and policy examination because the results of multiple scenarios can easily be compared the modeling process is often defined as beginning through building a conceptual or mental model of the relationships among key variables translating the relationships into a quantitative or mathematical model entering that model into a computer usually via standard computer programming languages validating and testing the model and then finally using the model to understand patterns of behavior or actions clauset et al 1987 coon 1988 over the last 50 years sd applications in water resources management have branched in many directions scholars can categorize these by their main problem focus regional analysis and river basin planning urban water flooding irrigation and pure process models with the development of sd the related software has come into existence for instance stella structure thinking experimental learning laboratory with animation is an application based on the sd environment and can deal with dynamic nonlinear and high order complex problems it is one of the most popular sd software packages and it supports a very intuitive graphical user interface that allows beginners to easily learn about sd winz et al 2009 the advent of stella with its visually oriented structure diagram provided a rich set of visual tools for making explicit the structural

system costanza and gottlieb 1998 because it has a strong modeling environment and simple operation it is highly recommended the software has a wide range of applications and has been extended to the field of water resources management it is applied to improve water resources management and simulate the sustainable utilization of water resources simonovic et al 1997 used stella ii to establish a goal oriented model to analyze the potential advantages of water resources planning in the nile river valley in egypt assaf 2009 established a groundwater resource management model based on economic principles to explore water resource management policies for different water requirements in the middle east and north africa sánchez román et al 2010 built a sd simulation model based on the stella platform to simulate and evaluate the water carrying capacity of 3 basins in brazil wang et al 2017 developed an integrated approach of sd orthogonal experimental design and inexact optimization to support water resources management under uncertainty and applied it in water stressed areas however most of these studies focused on basins not on the water resources management of administrative regions few people have applied it to the water resources management of a city therefore the objective of this study is to develop a method that integrates a sd model and a stochastic optimization model for water resources planning to support water resources management this research will improve a the method of simulating water resources management based on sd b the model for sustainable water resources based on a city scale and c the coupling of the supply and demand prediction model of water resources and optimization model the proposed model will then be applied to zhengzhou city in central china 2 overview of the research city zhengzhou city is located in north central china 112 42 e to 114 14 e 34 16 n to 34 58 n covers approximately 7446 2 km2 and is the capital of henan province which is china s most populous province and the province with the fifth highest gross domestic product gdp zhengzhou consists of 6 municipal districts i e huiji jinshui zhongyuan erqi and guancheng 1 county i e zhongmu and 5 county level cities i e cities of xingyang gongyi dengfeng xinmi and xinzheng as shown in fig 1 there are 124 rivers in zhengzhou city among which 29 rivers have larger basin area all these rivers belong to the two major water systems of yellow river and huaihe river li and lu 2017 the yellow river plays a significant role in the development of the regional economy as the major source of freshwater for a large number of people living there increasing population and socio economic development have put a lot of pressure on the water resources of this basin anticipated climate and socio economic changes may further increase water scarcity yin et al 2017 zhengzhou city has long suffered from an intense conflict between its limited water resources and the rapid growth of water demand the per capita water resources in zhengzhou is 178 m3 in 2016 basins are defined as being water stressed if they have a per capita water availability less than 1700 m3 per year or as facing water scarcity when supplies drop below 1000 m3 per year archer et al 2010 currently the most important mega city of the central plain economic region zhengzhou is also an important node city on the new silk road between europe and asia with the rapid development of the economy and the continuous improvement of the overall level of society water consumption continues to increase yearly zhengzhou city still has a serious water shortage therefore it is significant to analyze and evaluate water supply and demand and establish a model for sustainable utilization of water resources 3 methodology the method is developed in the following steps i sd analysis is applied to build a model of the sd of the sustainable utilization of water resources in zhengzhou considering water resources society economy population and environment as a comprehensive general system ii using the results of the water resources model such as the water supply and demand of each sector interval parameter two stage stochastic programming is developed to support water resources management the results of this study can help decision makers weigh the costs of the system the water allocation objectives and the system risk the framework of this study is shown in fig 2 3 1 a systems dynamics model for water resources utilization to find an effective way to solve the problem of sustainable water resources utilization in zhengzhou city a sd model of the water resources and the social economy system was built the model uses the administrative boundary of zhengzhou city as the boundary the time scale is from 2009 to 2020 with a time step of 1 year this model which considers all three issues discussed above focuses on three aspects 1 enhancing storm water management with the rapid development of urbanization the urban impervious area has expanded and the runoff coefficient has greatly increased consequently the runoff increased more than ever before and drainage pressure increased bagheri 2006 guo et al 2001 because of the urban area s combined sewer heavy rain causes sewage backup and city flooding in the flood season the yearly precipitation in zhengzhou city is more than 8 6 108 m3 which is worth 474 million yuan of consumable water the amount of infiltration water is 7 2 108 m3 and groundwater recharge is 1 1 108 m3 which has a benefit of more than 200 million yuan feng et al 2013 however more than 90 of the rainfall is not used this is a huge waste zhengzhou city has no real sense of the system of urban rainwater collection and utilization most of the rain is treated as waste water flowing into the surrounding rivers the annual amount of rainwater collected can be calculated by the following formula 1 w a β α ρ where a is the urban area β is the mean annual rainfall α is the impervious area ratio and ρ is the runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient of impervious surfaces such as concrete and asphalt pavement is generally 0 9 2 restriction of groundwater exploitation zhengzhou city lacks available surface water resources urban water relies primarily on water and groundwater from the yellow river currently the degree of development of water resources exceeds the carrying capacity of water resources and environmental requirements in the middle route of the south to north water diversion project the government should appropriately control the exploitation of shallow groundwater and take some groundwater recharge measures to gradually restore and protect the groundwater environment the 12th five year 2011 2015 plan of zhengzhou city noted the need to build a water saving society improve the level of intensive utilization of water resources make full use of surface water strictly limit the exploitation of groundwater and scientifically plan new sources of water in this model the groundwater exploitation is assumed to decrease at a rate of 5 per year 3 strengthening wastewater reuse to solve water shortage problems many countries have used city sewage as a second fresh water resource israel a country with severe water shortages had 210 municipal wastewater reuse projects across the country in 1987 90 of the sewage is collected and 80 of this collected sewage is treated and 60 65 is used for agriculture industrial and municipal water use in addition in countries such as russia european countries india south africa and namibia sewage reuse is very common the reuse of reclaimed water has become a strategic measure to solve the water resource problems around the world and some countries have substantial experience in this model the relationship between environmental protection investment and wastewater reuse is quantified the sewage recycling rate is gradually increased with economic development the proposed model consists of four subsystems the population system economic system water supply system and water demand system the boundary between the four subsystems is vague but they are closely related and interdependent 3 1 1 population subsystem this subsystem simulates the change of the rate of urbanization urban population and rural population by collecting and analyzing statistical data a change in the price of water has a direct influence on water consumption research shows when water charges account for 1 of revenue residents will not consider the price of water when it accounts for 2 some residents begin to pay attention to how much water they use when it accounts for 2 5 most of the residents will start to pay attention to saving water and when it accounts for 5 the vast majority of residents will pay attention to saving water therefore it is necessary to simulate the per capita disposable income and the price of water to predict the daily water consumption of urban residents it is understood that the price of water for residents in zhengzhou city has been 2 40 yuan m3 over the past 10 years which is detrimental to the residents water saving behavior in this study we assume that the price of water will change at a certain rate after 2009 the model can calculate the water consumption of urban residents by forecasting the change of water price to meet water saving requirements the relationship between daily water consumption and water price change rate is shown in eq 2 2 wu wu 2009 wpc ec where wu is the per capita daily water consumption wu 2009 is wu value in 2009 the beginning year wpc is the water price change rate and ec is an elastic coefficient fig 3 3 1 2 economic subsystem this submodel analyzed the economic situation of zhengzhou city from 2009 2013 and simulated the total values of primary secondary and tertiary industries to obtain the total gdp there is always a proportional relationship between fixed assets investment and gdp therefore it is easy to calculate the investment in fixed assets and then calculate the investment in the environment the purpose of simulating environmental protection investment is to quantify the relationship between it and the wastewater reuse rate fig 4 3 1 3 water supply subsystem water resource supply consists of four parts surface water groundwater rainwater and wastewater reuse according to the statistics of the water resources bulletin of zhengzhou city the surface water supply of zhengzhou city is relatively stable at approximately 660 million m3 per year to make the simulation more realistic it is necessary to analyze the surface water supply and add a change factor which is the ratio of the maximum or minimum supply to the average supply according to the requirements of the zhengzhou city plan in 12th five year plan 2011 2015 the groundwater supply is reduced at a rate of 5 per year based on an average of approximately 1 102 billion m3 the amount of rainwater is calculated according to formula 1 in 2009 the rainwater collection rate of zhengzhou city was only 1 and the annual growth rate is assumed to be 50 until 2020 the amount of wastewater reuse is the product of wastewater quantity and recovery rate the next step is to use the mathematical software to analyze the environmental protection investment and wastewater reuse rate the results are shown in fig 5 using this formula the sewage reuse rate can be calculated from to the environmental protection investment amount the higher the investment is in environmental protection the higher the reuse rate is to avoid the problem of a recycling rate over 100 the limitation of 65 is set fig 6 3 1 4 water demand subsystem the demand of water resources is composed of four parts agricultural water industrial water domestic water and ecological water agricultural water use includes two parts farmland irrigation water and other water use there are many methods to forecast irrigation water such as the water quota method comparison and extension method empirical formula method and regression analysis saysel 2004 saysel and barlas 2002 according to the availability of data the regression analysis method is used in the model the effective irrigation area and effective utilization coefficient of farmland water are selected as related factors the result is shown in eq 3 3 i 24 695 ia 0 02377 iuc 26 169 where i is agricultural irrigation water ia is effective irrigation area and iuc is the agricultural water use efficiency the effective irrigation area is a perennial stable value iuc is a sensitive parameter and will reach 0 5 at the end of the 11th five year plan 2006 2010 and 0 63 at the end of the 13th five year plan 2016 2020 to achieve this goal a specific growth rate is needed because of the complexity of the water consumption by forestry animal husbandry and fisheries it is assumed to account for a proportion of irrigation water according to the statistical data this ratio is approximately 0 25 industrial water consumption can be calculated by the following formula 4 iw idv wc where iw is industrial water idv is industrial added value and wc is the water consumption per 10000 industrial added value domestic water is made up of two parts domestic water and public water residents water consists of urban residents water and rural residents water urban residents water can be calculated using eq 2 rural residents living water use can be calculated using the quota method public water involves multiple departments and the data are difficult to obtain therefore it is assumed to account for 21 2 of residents water fig 7 the other complementary information about equations in software stella of zhengzhou city water system are referred to supplementary information at the end of this article 3 2 interval parameter two stage stochastic programming because of the excessive exploitation of water resources and the pollution of water resources the utilization of water resources is very limited tan et al 2011a b the establishment and implementation of a sustainable management scheme associated with stakeholders is quite complicated and needs an efficient tool to complement the decisions xue et al 2016 to make a rational allocation of limited water resources decision making departments predict the water consumption of various departments and determine the actual allocation of water to achieve the goal li et al 2008 li and huang 2009 tan et al 2013 if the target is reached it is necessary to control the minimum cost if you cannot reach the target economic penalties are incurred and water costs will increase the model is constructed as follows 5 min f i i i j 1 j a ij w ij i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h b j p ih c ijh constraint condition minimum water demand constraint 6 i 1 i w ij w j min i j water withdrawal constraint 7 j 1 j w ij w i max i non negative constraint 8 w ij c ij 0 i j h where a ij is the water distribution cost from water source i to department j w ij is the expected water allocation from water sources i to department j b j is the punishment when the actual amount of water does not meet the expected allocation of water p ih is the probability of q ih water supply quantity in different level years c ijh is the water shortage i i 1 2 i represents different sources j j 1 2 j represents different departments and h is the different flow level of water sources in the process of solving a model it is necessary to introduce a decision variable λ ij tan et al 2010 when the value of w ij is certain the model can be divided into two submodels which are the upper and lower bounds of the function values the linear programming method can be used to solve the two submodels chen et al 2010 lv et al 2011 w ij w ij δ w ij λ ij δ w ij w ij w ij 0 λ ij 1 by solving the optimal value of λ ij the optimal value of w ij can be calculated tan et al 2011a b the submodel with the lower bound of objective function is as follows 9 min f i 1 i j 1 j a ij w ij δ w ij λ ij i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h b j p ij c ijh constraint conditions 10 i 1 i w ij δ w ij λ ij w j min j h

resources bulletin of zhengzhou city statistical bulletin of national economic and social development of zhengzhou city and environmental statistics annual report of zhengzhou city tables 1 2 3 4 4 results and discussions 4 1 model validation the model was verified by the water supply data of water resources bulletin of zhengzhou city in 2009 2013 the relative error is calculated tables 5 and 6 4 2 results water use and supply of each department from 2009 to 2020 is calculated by the sd model and the results are shown in table 7 table 8 shows the water distribution target and the minimum water demand for different departments the results of the optimization model are shown in table 9 the results of the model are given by interval according to the results the optimal allocation of water for each department is obtained by the formula w ij w ij δ w ij λ ij the optimal water allocation is determined by the decision variable λ ij when the value of the decision variable is 1 it indicates that the optimal water distribution target is at the upper limit of the expected water supply when the decision variable value is 0 it indicates that the optimal water distribution target is at the lower limit of water supply for example for the industrial sector λ 11 0 15 λ 21 0 represents the optimal water distribution target of industrial water at the lower limit of water supply 4 3 discussion comparison of the allocation of water in three water distribution departments shows that the optimal allocation of water is the largest the demand for agricultural water is much greater than the demands of the other two departments λ 12 1 and λ 22 0 51 show that the demand for water is very dependent on surface water the optimal allocation of agricultural water is very close to the expected allocation of water because the residential water of zhengzhou city relies heavily on the yellow river the optimal allocation of surface water is very close to the expected water allocation of λ 13 1 the interval value of the solution of the model is an optimal expression and can provide more choices for decision makers when selecting optimal values the cost of the water distribution system is closely related to water shortage a low cost corresponds to low water supply capacity and an insufficient water supply capacity will produce a significant water shortage a high cost corresponds to high water supply capacity and sufficient water resources but can easily lead to waste of resources decision makers need to weigh the costs of the system the allocation of water and the system risk 5 conclusions in this paper the sd method was used to simulate water resources utilization in zhengzhou city the results show that the effect is good the disparity between the supply and demand of water resources in zhengzhou city is very prominent water demand of zhengzhou city will reach 2 57 billion m3 in 2020 the sustainable utilization of water resources is a necessary condition for economic and social development but zhengzhou city is a city facing water shortages water shortages and a deterioration of water quality have begun to affect the development of zhengzhou city the city must seek ways to sustainability utilize water resources as soon as possible a water resources optimization model is established based on interval parameter two stage stochastic programming the results show that the optimal water allocation of agricultural water is the largest and is dependent on surface water in the aspect of residential water the optimal allocation of water resources is based on satisfying daily life so there is no shortage of water the results of the optimal allocation model provide a good reference for the decision maker to weigh the cost of the water system the water distribution target and the system risk the method developed of a hybrid system dynamics and optimization approach is rational to support water resources management in cities and it is solidly supported with previous studies and collected data the method is potentially useful for water resources management acknowledgement this research was supported by national key research and development

year or as facing water scarcity when supplies drop below 1000 m3 per year archer et al 2010 currently the most important mega city of the central plain economic region zhengzhou is also an important node city on the new silk road between europe and asia with the rapid development of the economy and the continuous improvement of the overall level of society water consumption continues to increase yearly zhengzhou city still has a serious water shortage therefore it is significant to analyze and evaluate water supply and demand and establish a model for sustainable utilization of water resources 3 methodology the method is developed in the following steps i sd analysis is applied to build a model of the sd of the sustainable utilization of water resources in zhengzhou considering water resources society economy population and environment as a comprehensive general system ii using the results of the water resources model such as the water supply and demand of each sector interval parameter two stage stochastic programming is developed to support water resources management the results of this study can help decision makers weigh the costs of the system the water allocation objectives and the system risk the framework of this study is shown in fig 2 3 1 a systems dynamics model for water resources utilization to find an effective way to solve the problem of sustainable water resources utilization in zhengzhou city a sd model of the water resources and the social economy system was built the model uses the administrative boundary of zhengzhou city as the boundary the time scale is from 2009 to 2020 with a time step of 1 year this model which considers all three issues discussed above focuses on three aspects 1 enhancing storm water management with the rapid development of urbanization the urban impervious area has expanded and the runoff coefficient has greatly increased consequently the runoff increased more than ever before and drainage pressure increased bagheri 2006 guo et al 2001 because of the urban area s combined sewer heavy rain causes sewage backup and city flooding in the flood season the yearly precipitation in zhengzhou city is more than 8 6 108 m3 which is worth 474 million yuan of consumable water the amount of infiltration water is 7 2 108 m3 and groundwater recharge is 1 1 108 m3 which has a benefit of more than 200 million yuan feng et al 2013 however more than 90 of the rainfall is not used this is a huge waste zhengzhou city has no real sense of the system of urban rainwater collection and utilization most of the rain is treated as waste water flowing into the surrounding rivers the annual amount of rainwater collected can be calculated by the following formula 1 w a β α ρ where a is the urban area β is the mean annual rainfall α is the impervious area ratio and ρ is the runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient of impervious surfaces such as concrete and asphalt pavement is generally 0 9 2 restriction of groundwater exploitation zhengzhou city lacks available surface water resources urban water relies primarily on water and groundwater from the yellow river currently the degree of development of water resources exceeds the carrying capacity of water resources and environmental requirements in the middle route of the south to north water diversion project the government should appropriately control the exploitation of shallow groundwater and take some groundwater recharge measures to gradually restore and protect the groundwater environment the 12th five year 2011 2015 plan of zhengzhou city noted the need to build a water saving society improve the level of intensive utilization of water resources make full use of surface water strictly limit the exploitation of groundwater and scientifically plan new sources of water in this model the groundwater exploitation is assumed to decrease at a rate of 5 per year 3 strengthening wastewater reuse to solve water shortage problems many countries have used city sewage as a second fresh water resource israel a country with severe water shortages had 210 municipal wastewater reuse projects across the country in 1987 90 of the sewage is collected and 80 of this collected sewage is treated and 60 65 is used for agriculture industrial and municipal water use in addition in countries such as russia european countries india south africa and namibia sewage reuse is very common the reuse of reclaimed water has become a strategic measure to solve the water resource problems around the world and some countries have substantial experience in this model the relationship between environmental protection investment and wastewater reuse is quantified the sewage recycling rate is gradually increased with economic development the proposed model consists of four subsystems the population system economic system water supply system and water demand system the boundary between the four subsystems is vague but they are closely related and interdependent 3 1 1 population subsystem this subsystem simulates the change of the rate of urbanization urban population and rural population by collecting and analyzing statistical data a change in the price of water has a direct influence on water consumption research shows when water charges account for 1 of revenue residents will not consider the price of water when it accounts for 2 some residents begin to pay attention to how much water they use when it accounts for 2 5 most of the residents will start to pay attention to saving water and when it accounts for 5 the vast majority of residents will pay attention to saving water therefore it is necessary to simulate the per capita disposable income and the price of water to predict the daily water consumption of urban residents it is understood that the price of water for residents in zhengzhou city has been 2 40 yuan m3 over the past 10 years which is detrimental to the residents water saving behavior in this study we assume that the price of water will change at a certain rate after 2009 the model can calculate the water consumption of urban residents by forecasting the change of water price to meet water saving requirements the relationship between daily water consumption and water price change rate is shown in eq 2 2 wu wu 2009 wpc ec where wu is the per capita daily water consumption wu 2009 is wu value in 2009 the beginning year wpc is the water price change rate and ec is an elastic coefficient fig 3 3 1 2 economic subsystem this submodel analyzed the economic situation of zhengzhou city from 2009 2013 and simulated the total values of primary secondary and tertiary industries to obtain the total gdp there is always a proportional relationship between fixed assets investment and gdp therefore it is easy to calculate the investment in fixed assets and then calculate the investment in the environment the purpose of simulating environmental protection investment is to quantify the relationship between it and the wastewater reuse rate fig 4 3 1 3 water supply subsystem water resource supply consists of four parts surface water groundwater rainwater and wastewater reuse according to the statistics of the water resources bulletin of zhengzhou city the surface water supply of zhengzhou city is relatively stable at approximately 660 million m3 per year to make the simulation more realistic it is necessary to analyze the surface water supply and add a change factor which is the ratio of the maximum or minimum supply to the average supply according to the requirements of the zhengzhou city plan in 12th five year plan 2011 2015 the groundwater supply is reduced at a rate of 5 per year based on an average of approximately 1 102 billion m3 the amount of rainwater is calculated according to formula 1 in 2009 the rainwater collection rate of zhengzhou city was only 1 and the annual growth rate is assumed to be 50 until 2020 the amount of wastewater reuse is the product of wastewater quantity and recovery rate the next step is to use the mathematical software to analyze the environmental protection investment and wastewater reuse rate the results are shown in fig 5 using this formula the sewage reuse rate can be calculated from to the environmental protection investment amount the higher the investment is in environmental protection the higher the reuse rate is to avoid the problem of a recycling rate over 100 the limitation of 65 is set fig 6 3 1 4 water demand subsystem the demand of water resources is composed of four parts agricultural water industrial water domestic water and ecological water agricultural water use includes two parts farmland irrigation water and other water use there are many methods to forecast irrigation water such as the water quota method comparison and extension method empirical formula method and regression analysis saysel 2004 saysel and barlas 2002 according to the availability of data the regression analysis method is used in the model the effective irrigation area and effective utilization coefficient of farmland water are selected as related factors the result is shown in eq 3 3 i 24 695 ia 0 02377 iuc 26 169 where i is agricultural irrigation water ia is effective irrigation area and iuc is the agricultural water use efficiency the effective irrigation area is a perennial stable value iuc is a sensitive parameter and will reach 0 5 at the end of the 11th five year plan 2006 2010 and 0 63 at the end of the 13th five year plan 2016 2020 to achieve this goal a specific growth rate is needed because of the complexity of the water consumption by forestry animal husbandry and fisheries it is assumed to account for a proportion of irrigation water according to the statistical data this ratio is approximately 0 25 industrial water consumption can be calculated by the following formula 4 iw idv wc where iw is industrial water idv is industrial added value and wc is the water consumption per 10000 industrial added value domestic water is made up of two parts domestic water and public water residents water consists of urban residents water and rural residents water urban residents water can be calculated using eq 2 rural residents living water use can be calculated using the quota method public water involves multiple departments and the data are difficult to obtain therefore it is assumed to account for 21 2 of residents water fig 7 the other complementary information about equations in software stella of zhengzhou city water system are referred to supplementary information at the end of this article 3 2 interval parameter two stage stochastic programming because of the excessive exploitation of water resources and the pollution of water resources the utilization of water resources is very limited tan et al 2011a b the establishment and implementation of a sustainable management scheme associated with stakeholders is quite complicated and needs an efficient tool to complement the decisions xue et al 2016 to make a rational allocation of limited water resources decision making departments predict the water consumption of various departments and determine the actual allocation of water to achieve the goal li et al 2008 li and huang 2009 tan et al 2013 if the target is reached it is necessary to control the minimum cost if you cannot reach the target economic penalties are incurred and water costs will increase the model is constructed as follows 5 min f i i i j 1 j a ij w ij i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h b j p ih c ijh constraint condition minimum water demand constraint 6 i 1 i w ij w j min i j water withdrawal constraint 7 j 1 j w ij w i max i non negative constraint 8 w ij c ij 0 i j h where a ij is the water distribution cost from water source i to department j w ij is the expected water allocation from water sources i to department j b j is the punishment when the actual amount of water does not meet the expected allocation of water p ih is the probability of q ih water supply quantity in different level years c ijh is the water shortage i i 1 2 i represents different sources j j 1 2 j represents different departments and h is the different flow level of water sources in the process of solving a model it is necessary to introduce a decision variable λ ij tan et al 2010 when the value of w ij is certain the model can be divided into two submodels which are the upper and lower bounds of the function values the linear programming method can be used to solve the two submodels chen et al 2010 lv et al 2011 w ij w ij δ w ij λ ij δ w ij w ij w ij 0 λ ij 1 by solving the optimal value of λ ij the optimal value of w ij can be calculated tan et al 2011a b the

resources bulletin of zhengzhou city statistical bulletin of national economic and social development of zhengzhou city and environmental statistics annual report of zhengzhou city tables 1 2 3 4 4 results and discussions 4 1 model validation the model was verified by the water supply data of water resources bulletin of zhengzhou city in 2009 2013 the relative error is calculated tables 5 and 6 4 2 results water use and supply of each department from 2009 to 2020 is calculated by the sd model and the results are shown in table 7 table 8 shows the water distribution target and the minimum water demand for different departments the results of the optimization model are shown in table 9 the results of the model are given by interval according to the results the optimal allocation of water for each department is obtained by the formula w ij w ij δ w ij λ ij the optimal water allocation is determined by the decision variable λ ij when the value of the decision variable is 1 it indicates that the optimal water distribution target is at the upper limit of the expected water supply when the decision variable value is 0 it indicates that the optimal water distribution target is at the lower limit of water supply for example for the industrial sector λ 11 0 15 λ 21 0 represents the optimal water distribution target of industrial water at the lower limit of water supply 4 3 discussion comparison of the allocation of water in three water distribution departments shows that the optimal allocation of water is the largest the demand for agricultural water is much greater than the demands of the other two departments λ 12 1 and λ 22 0 51 show that the demand for water is very dependent on surface water the optimal allocation of agricultural water is very close to the expected allocation of water because the residential water of zhengzhou city relies heavily on the yellow river the optimal allocation of surface water is very close to the expected water allocation of λ 13 1 the interval value of the solution of the model is an optimal expression and can provide more choices for decision makers when selecting optimal values the cost of the water distribution system is closely related to water shortage a low cost corresponds to low water supply capacity and an insufficient water supply capacity will produce a significant water shortage a high cost corresponds to high water supply capacity and sufficient water resources but can easily lead to waste of resources decision makers need to weigh the costs of the system the allocation of water and the system risk 5 conclusions in this paper the sd method was used to simulate water resources utilization in zhengzhou city the results show that the effect is good the disparity between the supply and demand of water resources in zhengzhou city is very prominent water demand of zhengzhou city will reach 2 57 billion m3 in 2020 the sustainable utilization of water resources is a necessary condition for economic and social development but zhengzhou city is a city facing water shortages water shortages and a deterioration of water quality have begun to affect the development of zhengzhou city the city must seek ways to sustainability utilize water resources as soon as possible a water resources optimization model is established based on interval parameter two stage stochastic programming the results show that the optimal water allocation of agricultural water is the largest and is dependent on surface water in the aspect of residential water the optimal allocation of water resources is based on satisfying daily life so there is no shortage of water the results of the optimal allocation model provide a good reference for the decision maker to weigh the cost of the water system the water distribution target and the system risk the method developed of a hybrid system dynamics and optimization approach is rational to support water resources management in cities and it is solidly supported with previous studies and collected data the method is potentially useful for water resources management acknowledgement this research was supported by national key research and development

7541,the impact of urbanization on streamflow depends on a variety of factors e g climate initial land cover inter basin transfers water withdrawals wastewater effluent etc the purpose of this study is to examine trends in streamflow from 1986 to 2015 in a range of watersheds within the rapidly urbanizing atlanta ga metropolitan area this study compares eight watersheds over three decades while minimizing the influence of inter annual precipitation variability population and land cover data were used to analyze changes over approximately twenty years within the watersheds precipitation totals for the watersheds were estimated using precipitation totals at nearby weather stations multiple streamflow variables such as annual streamflow frequencies of high flow days hfds flashiness and precipitation adjusted streamflow for the eight streams were calculated using daily streamflow data variables were tested for significant trends from 1986 to 2015 and significant differences between 1986 2000 and 2001 2015 flashiness increased for all streams without municipal water withdrawals and the four watersheds with the largest increase in developed land had significant increases in flashiness significant positive trends in precipitation adjusted mean annual streamflow and hfds occurred for the two watersheds big creek and suwanee creek that experienced the largest increases in development and these were the only watersheds that went from majority forest land in 1986 to majority developed land in 2015 with a disproportionate increase in hfd occurrence during summer big creek and suwannee creek also had a reduction in intra annual variability of hfd occurrence watersheds that were already substantially developed at the beginning of the period and did not have wastewater discharge had declining streamflow the most urbanized watershed peachtree creek had a significant decrease in streamflow and a possible cause of the decrease was increasing groundwater infiltration into sewers the impacts of urbanization on streamflow within the metropolitan area have undoubtedly been felt by a wide of range of communities keywords urbanization streamflow precipitation watershed water resources 1 introduction urban development within watersheds can cause major changes to streamflow urbanization results in the creation of severely compacted and impervious surfaces changes in consumptive use of water inter basin water transfers and the presence of water supply sewage and stormwater infrastructure dewalle et al 2000 emerson et al 2005 claessens et al 2006 goff and gentry 2006 cuo et al 2008 bhaskar et al 2016 when urbanization occurs in forested areas the impacts on hydrology are magnified compared to agriculture to urban changes forest to urban changes cause dramatic decreases in evapotranspiration dow and dewalle 2000 brown et al 2009 one of the dominant impacts of urbanization is increased peak flows and stream flashiness the frequency of high flows is positively correlated with the degree of urbanization of a watershed especially those in warm humid climates poff et al 2006 brown et al 2009 steuer et al 2010 multiple studies have found increasing peak flow volumes and increasing frequencies of high flows over time as watersheds become more urbanized jennings and jarnagin 2002 konrad and booth 2005 white and greer 2006 beighley and moglen 2002 rosburg et al 2017 stream flashiness is positively correlated with urbanization in non arid regions mcmahon et al 2003 poff et al 2006 and flashiness increases over time for streams in urbanizing watersheds dow 2007 the increased flashiness is reflected in a storm recession constant for urban streams that is up to double that of other streams rose and peters 2001 the introduction and expansion of storm drainage systems is a major contributor to increased flashiness miller et al 2014 previous research has shown a weak impact of urbanization on mean annual streamflow increased impervious surfaces should increase storm runoff and thus streamflow but infiltration reduction can lead to reduced dry period flows cuo et al 2008 nevertheless leaks are present in water distribution systems and may provide recharge to shallow aquifers or augmented flows in surface waters meyer 2002 wastewater pipes in a watershed can both increase and decrease streamflow sewer leaks which occur when the pipes are above the water table increases groundwater discharge to streams while sewer infiltration which occurs when pipes are below the water table reduces groundwater discharge to streams meyer 2002 bhaskar et al 2016 infiltration and inflow i i which combines the aforementioned groundwater infiltration with stormwater inflow into wastewater pipes can greatly reduce subsurface water storage in urbanized watersheds bhaskar et al 2015 in addition flow in wastewater pipes may be supplemented by captured streams and springs broadhead et al 2013 spatially extensive water supply and wastewater treatment systems of urbanizing areas often rely upon inter basin transfers diminishing streamflow in one basin and augmenting another zhuang 2016 but also altering groundwater hydraulics in combination with i i schwartz and smith 2014 in addition to streamflow altering infrastructure precipitation variations also can mask expected increasing trends in mean annual streamflow resulting from urbanization annual precipitation and mean annual streamflow are often highly correlated for example annual precipitation totals explain 44 of the variance in streamflow in urbanizing watersheds in the houston texas area rogers and defee 2005 runoff ratios i e streamflow divided by precipitation a commonly used precipitation adjustment metric also have been shown to be significantly positively correlated with precipitation hubbart and zell 2013 therefore runoff ratios do not remove the precipitation effect greater insight into the effects of urbanization on streamflow could be produced if a study compared watersheds over multiple decades while minimizing the influence of inter annual precipitation variability having both multi decadal data and a robust number of watersheds in a region enhances an investigation of environmental causes of streamflow changes dow 2007 therefore the purpose of this study is to examine trends in precipitation adjusted streamflow from 1986 to 2015 in a range of watersheds within an urbanizing metropolitan area 2 study region the selected study region is the atlanta georgia metropolitan area in the piedmont physiographic province in the eastern united states fig 1 atlanta has been one of the fastest growing areas in the united states over the past several decades the population of the metropolitan area i e 29 counties increased from 2 2 million persons in 1980 to 5 3 million persons in 2010 u s census bureau 1996 2017 urban effects on streamflow in the piedmont have been found in multiple studies brun and band 2000 rose and peters 2001 jennings and jarnagin 2002 brandes et al 2005 konrad and booth 2005 brown et al 2009 hopkins et al 2015b comparison studies show that urbanization impacts streamflow in the piedmont more than in other regions especially those regions without natural forest cover brown et al 2009 hopkins et al 2015b the eight streams used in this study are big creek flint river line creek peachtree creek sope creek south river suwanee creek and sweetwater creek table 1 metropolitan atlanta is situated on the eastern sub continental divide of north america and spans three major river basins the hydrologic and hydraulic impacts of atlanta s urbanization affect the apalachicola chattahoochee flint acf the alabama coosa tallapoosa act and the altamaha ocmulgee oconee aoo river basins fig 1 seven of the eight watersheds examined in this study are in the acf basin the south river watershed is in the aoo basin approximately 73 of the water supply in the 15 county metropolitan north georgia water planning district is sourced from the chattahoochee river basin e g lake lanier in fig 1 metropolitan north georgia water planning district 2009 for example the water users in the entire drainage area of the upper south river drainage considered in this study are provided with water sourced from the chattahoochee basin legal conflicts between georgia florida and alabama over flows in the acf and act impacted by metro atlanta water use have persisted for over 25 years and as such these inter basin transfers of water are pertinent to ongoing transboundary water resource disputes borden 2014 urban flooding is a persistent problem in the watersheds of the atlanta metropolitan area and growth in exposure to flooding has been directly linked with population growth and spatially correlated with concentrations of urban development ferguson and ashley 2017 3 material and methods 3 1 population and land cover population housing and land cover data were analyzed to determine changes over approximately twenty years within the eight watersheds as well as the relative differences in ages of sewers gridded population density data for 1990 and 2010 at 100 m and 60 m resolution respectively were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs falcone 2016 national land cover databases nlcd from 1992 2001 and 2011 were acquired from the multi resolution land characteristics mrlc consortium vogelmann et al 2001 homer et al 2015 xian et al 2011 each database had a spatial resolution of 30 m a land cover database with 21 classes was available for 1992 while for 2001 and 2011 there were 16 class land cover databases along with percent developed impervious databases available the nlcd 1992 2001 change retrofit product fry et al 2009 allowed proper comparison between 1992 and 2001 by combining the land cover classes into six general classes agriculture barren developed forest grass shrubland water and wetland estimates of percent imperviousness for the eight watersheds in 1992 were calculated by dividing the percent developed land in 1992 by the mean of the 2001 and 2011 ratios of developed land to developed impervious land finally the mean year of structure completion which was used as a proxy for age of sewers was extracted from american community survey 2011 2015 block group data provided by the u s census bureau 3 2 precipitation precipitation time series from 1986 to 2015 for the eight watersheds were created using precipitation totals at nearby weather stations fig 1 and table 2 monthly precipitation data for 12 stations were extracted from the global historical climatology network database of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration if multiple rain gauges were associated with a station during a month then the median total from those stations was used for that station griffin and winder had 67 and 5 months respectively with missing rainfall totals and those missing values were replaced with mean totals from the closest of the remaining stations an inverse distance weighting scheme was used to estimate watershed precipitation totals from the gauge based totals the weights are shown in table 2 at least four stations were used to estimate monthly precipitation at a watershed since the pooling of data from multiple stations helps minimize the impacts of station specific discontinuities easterling and peterson 1995 3 3 soil water budget a soil water budget was used to determine when water surplus and water deficit typically occur thereby enabling a better understanding of intra annual variations in streamflow an initial budget corresponding to a 0 5 grid cell centered on 34 0 n and 84 5 w was created using the webwimp water budget model http climate geog udel edu wimp willmott et al 1985 the default soil water storage capacity of 150 mm m 1 was not altered but mean month precipitation and temperature data from 1986 to 2015 were used to adjust the model for the study region monthly precipitation totals were the mean of the values from the eight watersheds see section 3 2 mean monthly temperatures were calculated for each watershed using gridded 4 km resolution monthly temperature data acquired from the prism climate group at oregon state university http prism oregonstate edu the final mean monthly temperatures used in the soil water budget model were the mean of the temperatures from the eight watersheds the model produced the following estimates for each month change in soil moisture from the end of the previous month to the end of the current month water deficit i e unmet water demand and surplus water i e surface runoff plus percolation below the plant root zone 3 4 watershed delineation and topography a digital elevation model dem was used to delineate watershed boundaries and compare topographic characteristics among the watersheds the dem had a spatial resolution of 30 m and was acquired from the national elevation dataset of the united states geological survey usgs the watershed tool in arcgis environmental systems research institute was used to delineate the watersheds in addition the mean slope of each watershed was calculated 3 5 streamflow variables multiple streamflow variables for the eight streams were calculated using daily streamflow data daily mean streamflow from 1986 to 2015 were acquired from the usgs while over 50 years of measurements were available at big creek line creek peachtree creek and sweetwater creek this study began in 1986 since the flint river sope creek south river and suwanee creek gauges were installed between 1983 and 1986 table 1 the watersheds i e drainage areas of the eight gauges ranged in size from 79 km2 for sope creek to 615 km2 for sweetwater creek this large range in drainage area is common among urban streamflow studies e g brandes et al 2005 brown et al 2009 rosburg et al 2017 and the disparity in sizes was needed in this study to capture a large range in urban development among the watersheds daily mean streamflow was converted from m3 s 1 to mm by diving by drainage area m2 and then multiplying by the appropriate number seconds to achieve streamflow at multiple temporal scales the following was calculated for each stream 1 annual streamflow 2 annual runoff ratio 3 maximum streamflow 4 baseflow index 5 median streamflow per day of year 6 mean monthly frequencies of high flow days hfds 7 mean and percentile values for hfd streamflow 8 flashiness index and 9 precipitation adjusted annual streamflow and frequencies of hfds maximum streamflow was the median value of the maximum daily streamflow for each of the 30 years and the baseflow index was the mean value of the 30 values of the annual 7 day minimum flow divided by mean daily flow for the year hopkins et al 2015b for this study hfds had daily streamflow above the 95th percentile for the 10 957 days therefore each stream had 547 hfds the r b index was used as the streamflow flashiness index and the index was calculated for each year by dividing the sum of the absolute values of day to day changes in mean daily flow by the total discharge for the year baker et al 2004 the precipitation adjustment of annual streamflow and hfd frequency involved regressing those variables against annual precipitation the resulting residuals i e observed minus predicted which were independent of annual precipitation were then treated as new hydrologic variables e g changnon and demissie 1996 rogers and defee 2005 hubbart and zell 2013 3 6 testing for significant trends and differences the hydroclimate variables were tested for significant trends from 1986 to 2015 as well as significant differences between 1986 2000 and 2001 2015 trends in precipitation streamflow runoff ratio frequency of hfds and flashiness over 1986 2015 were assessed using kendall tau correlation tests α 0 05 one tailed the kendall theil robust line the median of the slopes between all combinations of two points in the data helsel and hirsch 2002 was used to estimate changes over the 30 year period mann whitney u tests α 0 05 one tailed were used to test for significant differences between 1986 2000 and 2001 2015 differences in seasonal frequencies of hfds between 1986 2000 and 2001 2015 also were examined two sample chi square tests α 0 05 were conducted for each epoch hfd combination contingency tables contained the following frequencies 1 hfds during 1986 2000 2 hfds during 2001 2015 3 non hfds during 1986 2000 and 4 non hfds during 2001 2015 3 7 water withdrawal and wastewater discharge water withdrawal and wastewater discharge data were analyzed to better understand changes in streamflow permitted non farm surface water withdrawal values for 2017 were obtained from the georgia department of natural resources environmental protection division 2017 permitted wastewater discharge values for 2006 and projected capacities for 2025 for wastewater treatment facilities were acquired from the 2009 water supply and water conservation plan of the metropolitan north georgia water planning district metropolitan north georgia water planning district 2009 monthly measured wastewater discharge in 2016 and 2017 for the snapfinger and pole bridge wastewater treatment facilities were acquired from dekalb county dekalb county wasteshed management 2017 4 results 4 1 population characteristics of the watersheds the watersheds with the lowest population densities in 1990 had the largest population increases over the following decades table 1 the two northernmost watersheds big creek and suwannee creek had the largest population increases the populations for big creek and suwanee creek nearly quadrupled and tripled respectively from 1990 to 2010 those two watersheds were among the three least densely populated watersheds in 1990 but by 2010 they were close to the mean value for all the watersheds two southern watersheds line creek and sweetwater creek had roughly a doubling of population over the 20 years the four most densely populated watersheds in 1990 peachtree creek south river sope creek and flint river had modest population increases from 1990 to 2010 nevertheless those four watersheds remained the four most densely populated watersheds in 2010 4 2 land cover characteristics of the watersheds population densities are linked to the development of the watershed therefore changes in the amount of developed land were for the most part highly linked with population changes table 1 there was approximately a doubling of developed land in the big creek and suwannee creek watersheds from 1992 to 2011 concomitantly there was also a doubling of impervious surfaces and the 2015 values most likely exceeded 20 for both watersheds the flint river watershed also had relatively large increases in both developed land and impervious surfaces the most developed watersheds in 1992 experienced the smallest growth over the following two decades the peachtree creek watershed the most developed and impervious watershed in 1992 had the smallest increases in developed land 3 and impervious surfaces 2 among all the watersheds the increase in developed land in the eight watersheds came almost entirely at the expense of forest land fig 2 supplementary fig s1 all watersheds lost forest land to development in 1992 developed land and forest land each comprised approximately 990 km2 within the eight watersheds by 2011 the amount of developed land increased by 300 km2 and the amount of forest land decreased by 300 km2 the two most rapidly urbanizing watersheds big creek and suwanee creek were the only two watersheds to transform from majority forest land in 1992 to majority developed land in 2011 the flint river peachtree creek sope creek and south river watersheds have been majority developed land since as late as 1992 line creek and sweetwater creek are on trajectories to becoming majority developed land in the next several decades 4 3 climate and streamflow characteristics the atlanta region has a subtropical humid climate type therefore spring snowmelt is negligible or nonexistent and there are distinct soil moisture surplus and deficit seasons fig 3 a and table 3 the eight watersheds received between 1250 mm and 1300 mm of precipitation annually and precipitation occurred consistently throughout the year over the course of a year the soil water surplus which occurred from december through april greatly exceeded the soil water deficit which occurred from july through september fig 3a despite similar precipitation totals temperatures and watershed slopes among the eight watersheds there were substantial differences in annual streamflow variables table 3 annual streamflow ranged from 407 mm at line creek to 576 mm at south river and those two streams had runoff ratios of 0 31 and 0 45 respectively the southernmost and least developed watersheds line creek and sweetwater creek had the smallest maximum flows while the two most developed watersheds peachtree creek and sope creek had the largest maximum flows line creek and sweetwater creek also had the lowest baseflow index values and on the other extreme was south river with a baseflow index that was nearly twice as high as the next highest value intra annual variations in streamflow at most watersheds related closely to monthly variations in the soil water balance with major discrepancies among the watersheds occurring during the surplus and deficit seasons fig 3 for the streams as a whole streamflow was maximized in late february early march i e the peak of the soil water surplus season and was at a minimum in september which was at the end of the soil water deficit season three major anomalies in fig 4 b are as follows 1 south river had approximately 70 more discharge than the other streams from june through september 2 line creek had approximately 50 less discharge than the other streams from june through september and 3 peachtree creek had approximately 35 less discharge than the other streams from december through april the intra annual variation in occurrence of high flow days was related strongly to climate and development fig 4a over 40 of the high flow days occurred from january through march i e soil water surplus months with march being the peak month july which had 15 more precipitation than the other summer months had the most hfds of the summer months compared to the other streams the most developed streams i e peachtree creek sope creek and south river had approximately 50 more hfds during the soil water deficit months i e july september and approximately 20 fewer hfds during the soil water surplus months i e december april accordingly there was a strong negative relationship between development and intra annual variability in hfd occurrence fig 4c the more developed the watershed the more intense the hfds fig 4b d peachtree creek and sope creek had the largest mean median first quartile and third quartile values for hfd streamflow line creek had the lowest values for those four statistics therefore there was an extremely strong relationship between developed land within a watershed and hfd mean streamflow 4 4 multi decadal changes in streamflow there were no significant trends from 1986 to 2015 in precipitation unadjusted streamflow and runoff ratio at any of the streams watersheds fig 5 a c streamflow was highly correlated i e 0 84 with precipitation and trends in streamflow were more substantial than trends in precipitation runoff ratio also was highly correlated with precipitation as has been found by hubbart and zell 2013 and the inter annual variability in precipitation masked trends in runoff ratio for all eight streams the inter annual variability and trends in streamflow and runoff ratio were nearly identical most of the streams had either significant trends significant inter epochal differences or both for hfds flashiness index hfd residuals or streamflow residuals fig 5d g there were significant positive trends in hfds at big creek and suwanee creek where hfd frequency increased by 101 and 90 respectively over the 30 years the flashiness index had significant positive trends at big creek flint river suwanee creek and sweetwater creek with the percent increases ranging from 20 at sweetwater creek to 66 at suwanee creek these four watersheds had the largest percentage increases in developed land from 1992 to 2011 removing the effects of inter annual precipitation variability revealed significant changes in streamflow and additional significant increases in hfds similar to streamflow hfd frequency also was strongly correlated with precipitation totals streamflow at big creek and suwannee creek increased by 26 while streamflow at peachtree creek decreased by 17 minimizing the influence of precipitation on hfds confirmed the significant increase in hfds at big creek and suwanee creek while revealing a relatively small yet significant increase in hfds at south river 32 increase at the seasonal scale increases in hfds were more common than decreases fig 6 big creek and suwanee creek had significant increases of 200 and 135 respectively in hfds in summer from 1986 2000 to 2001 2015 none of the other increases for stream season combinations were significant the only significant decrease occurred at line creek which experienced a 40 decrease in hfds during winter from 1986 2000 to 2001 2015 increased developed land was strongly positively correlated with mean streamflow hfds and flashiness fig 7 big creek and suwanee creek had much larger increases in percent developed land from 1992 to 2011 than the other watersheds and big creek and suwanee creek had the largest increases in runoff ratio mean streamflow hfds and flashiness from 1986 to 2015 only one other stream south river had increases in all four variables over the 30 years it had a relatively large change in runoff ratio streamflow and hfds with respect to the modest change in developed land in the watershed five streams had decreases in runoff ratio and streamflow with peachtree creek having the largest decreases three streams peachtree creek line creek and sope creek had decreases in hfds and with the exception of line creek streams had increased flashiness over the 30 years 5 discussion increased development of watersheds in the atlanta metropolitan area is the likely cause of increased maximum flows flashiness of streams and decreased intra annual variability in frequencies of hfds figs 4 and 5 significant positive correlations between urbanization and maximum flows have been found previously for atlanta as well as for raleigh milwaukee green bay and dallas fort worth brown et al 2009 the more developed watersheds e g peachtree creek in the atlanta region have had relatively more hfds during the summer than the less developed watersheds e g sweetwater creek thus hfds are distributed more evenly throughout the year in urbanized watersheds urbanization of the big creek and suwanee creek watersheds contributed to substantial increases in streamflow from 1986 to 2015 annual streamflow increased by over 115 mm i e a 26 increase in both watersheds the increased streamflow caused the runoff ratio to increase from approximately 0 35 to 0 45 over the past 30 years the increased streamflow was particularly evident in the increase of hfds the number of hfds increased by approximately 100 for both streams the largest percentage based increases in hfds for big creek and suwanee creek occurred during the summer thereby decreasing the intra annual variability in hfd frequency and making those streams more similar to peachtree creek and sope creek the two most urbanized watersheds the hfd results are similar to what has been found for other urbanizing watersheds in atlanta and watersheds in other parts of the united states among eight small watersheds located in gwinnett county of metropolitan atlanta there was a positive correlation between trends in effective impervious area and trends in peak streamflow and runoff from 2001 to 2008 aulenbach et al 2017 for six urbanizing watersheds examined in baltimore md boston ma and pittsburgh pa there were significant increases in annual frequency of high flow events in all watersheds over periods of at least 40 years precipitation did not increase significantly at any of the watersheds hopkins et al 2015a and in western washington the 95th percentile of daily flows increased by approximately 40 from 1960 to 2010 rosburg et al 2017 inter basin water transfers contributing substantial effluent from two wastewater treatment plants were responsible for the relatively high streamflow especially in the summer at south river table 3 and fig 4 treated wastewater supplements urban streamflow throughout the developed world paul and meyer 2001 with dramatic increases in discharge in arid and semi arid regions dennehy et al 1998 townsend small et al 2013 the present day combined discharge from the snapfinger and pole bridge facilities most of which originated as an inter basin transfer provides approximately 84 mm of additional annual streamflow at the south river gauge this effluent discharge is approximately half the permitted amount table 3 the wastewater effluent increases annual streamflow by up to 15 and thus gives south river an artificially high runoff ratio for example without this excess water the runoff ratio for 2011 2015 would have been 0 35 compared to the actual value of 0 41 wastewater discharge from the two treatment plants might reach 352 000 m3 day 1 i e 270 mm annually in 2025 table 3 and thus add an additional 186 mm annually to the south river and result in an extremely high runoff ratio of 0 55 i i is a possible cause of the relatively low streamflow at peachtree creek during winter and spring as well as the decreasing streamflow over the 30 years during december april when the water table is high peachtree creek has 35 less streamflow i e approximately 54 mm than the other streams annual streamflow for peachtree creek decreased by 100 mm from 1986 to 2015 the peachtree creek watershed which has the highest population density among the watersheds and highest percentage of developed land should have the highest density of sewage pipes moreover the amount of infiltration increases proportionally with the age of the sewer in rödel et al 2017 and much of the housing in the watershed is at least 40 years old table 1 i i has been show to greatly affect the hydrological budget in baltimore another piedmont city with a climate similar to that of atlanta i i is the largest human influence on groundwater levels in the baltimore metropolitan areas with an annual loss of water of 29 mm for the region as a whole and annual losses of hundreds to thousands of mm in some heavily urbanized parts of baltimore bhaskar et al 2015 urbanization and the associated increase in wastewater effluent is the likely cause of the 30 increase in hfd frequency at south river over the past three decades since 1986 the population has increased by at least 12 and the watershed has become at least 9 more developed along with an increase in the amount of impervious cover table 1 similar to peachtree creek and other urbanized watersheds i i is probably a major issue in the south river watershed except that i i water remains in the south river watershed and is eventually discharged at the two wastewater treatment plants upstream of the stream gauge wastewater effluent in general has increased from the two facilities as the watershed population has increased water withdrawals are the likely cause of the relatively low streamflow of line creek this is the only stream with water withdrawals for municipal consumption as a result it has the smallest runoff ratio and baseflow index of all the streams the current permitted water withdrawals total approximately 100 000 m3 day 1 and if fulfilled would reduce annual streamflow by 155 mm table 3 there is relatively little wastewater effluent discharge i e the permitted total is less than 23 000 m3 day 1 to compensate for the above water loss compared with the least impacted stream sweetwater creek streamflow of line creek from 1986 to 2015 was 15 lower direct and indirect water removal from line creek watershed caused streamflow to decrease by 20 from 1986 to 2015 although there was not a significant trend in mean annual streamflow four of the five most negative streamflow residuals occurred in the final eight years of the study period the population of the watershed increased by 130 from 1990 to 2010 table 1 and since 1986 several reservoirs have been constructed within the watershed an existing water treatment plant has been expanded multiple times and a new plant was completed in 2001 fayette county water system 2017 the reservoirs might cause large losses of water even small reservoirs in the southeastern united states can account for considerable evaporative losses severely impacting hydrologic flows especially in drier years ignatius and stallins 2011 in 2016 the newnan utilities pumping station on line creek began increasing water withdrawals by 25 over withdrawals in 2015 newnan utilities 2015 during the second half of 2012 line creek effectively ran dry above the fayette county and newnan utilities water intakes suggesting that both impacts from land use and evaporative losses from small reservoirs may be contributing to extremely low surface flows especially in periods of drought emanuel and rogers 2013 increased water withdrawals land use change including urbanization and increased impoundments in the upper flint river basin such as in line creek are having detrimental impacts downstream including limitations to recreational use in times of drought disruption to environmental flows and extreme low flow events that threaten endemic and endangered species and an increased threat of water scarcity for municipal agricultural and industrial withdrawals emanuel and rogers 2013 emanuel 2014 moreover these impacts further compound the issues in the so called water wars over flows in the acf basin between georgia florida and alabama 6 conclusions the impact of urbanization on multi decadal changes in hydrological variables depends on a variety of factors including climate initial land cover pace of development water withdrawals inter basin transfers wastewater discharges and the extent and age of sewage pipes this study has shown that each of those factors contributed to varying trends in precipitation adjusted streamflow and hfds in the atlanta metropolitan area from 1986 to 2015 while all eight watersheds in the study had increased developed land and impervious surfaces over the 30 years significant increases in streamflow only occurred in the two watersheds that transitioned from majority forest land to majority developed land watersheds that were over 60 developed at the beginning of the period and did not have wastewater discharge actually had declining streamflow with i i being a probable cause these streams also did not have increases in hfds which was more common than increased annual streamflow among the eight streams the only other stream without increases in hfds was the stream with large and increasing water withdrawals for municipal consumption hfd occurrence in the atlanta area peaks in spring and is lowest in summer but urbanization causes a much larger increase in hfds during summer compared to the other seasons therefore the most urbanized watersheds have the smallest intra annual variability in hfds those watersheds also had the most intense hfds the diverse impacts of urbanization on streamflow within the atlanta metropolitan area have undoubtedly been felt by a wide of range of communities increased hfds in urbanizing watersheds such as big creek and suwanee creek contributes to greater vulnerability to flooding in many urban and suburban communities of metropolitan atlanta on the other hand atlanta despite its relatively humid climate and seeming abundance of surface flows is increasingly stressed by the availability of fresh water line creek and other watersheds in the upper flint river have been severely impacted in recent decades by increasing water withdrawals and diminished flows resulting from urbanization especially in periods of drought the compounding downstream effects of diminished flows as exhibited in line creek threaten the water supply of increasing numbers of metro atlanta residents degrade riparian and aquatic habitats and create disconnections in environmental flows moreover both the decreased flows in the upper flint river system and inter basin transfers of water from the chattahoochee basin into the upper south river watershed contribute to escalating interstate conflicts over minimum flows in the acf basin consequently a better understanding of hydraulic and hydrologic processes is essential for planning urban development designing effective infrastructure mitigating pollution and

is to examine trends in streamflow from 1986 to 2015 in a range of watersheds within the rapidly urbanizing atlanta ga metropolitan area this study compares eight watersheds over three decades while minimizing the influence of inter annual precipitation variability population and land cover data were used to analyze changes over approximately twenty years within the watersheds precipitation totals for the watersheds were estimated using precipitation totals at nearby weather stations multiple streamflow variables such as annual streamflow frequencies of high flow days hfds flashiness and precipitation adjusted streamflow for the eight streams were calculated using daily streamflow data variables were tested for significant trends from 1986 to 2015 and significant differences between 1986 2000 and 2001 2015 flashiness increased for all streams without municipal water withdrawals and the four watersheds with the largest increase in developed land had significant increases in flashiness significant positive trends in precipitation adjusted mean annual streamflow and hfds occurred for the two watersheds big creek and suwanee creek that experienced the largest increases in development and these were the only watersheds that went from majority forest land in 1986 to majority developed land in 2015 with a disproportionate increase in hfd occurrence during summer big creek and suwannee creek also had a reduction in intra annual variability of hfd occurrence watersheds that were already substantially developed at the beginning of the period and did not have wastewater discharge had declining streamflow the most urbanized watershed peachtree creek had a significant decrease in streamflow and a possible cause of the decrease was increasing groundwater infiltration into sewers the impacts of urbanization on streamflow within the metropolitan area have undoubtedly been felt by a wide of range of communities keywords urbanization streamflow precipitation watershed water resources 1 introduction urban development within watersheds can cause major changes to streamflow urbanization results in the creation of severely compacted and impervious surfaces changes in consumptive use of water inter basin water transfers and the presence of water supply sewage and stormwater infrastructure dewalle et al 2000 emerson et al 2005 claessens et al 2006 goff and gentry 2006 cuo et al 2008 bhaskar et al 2016 when urbanization occurs in forested areas the impacts on hydrology are magnified compared to agriculture to urban changes forest to urban changes cause dramatic decreases in evapotranspiration dow and dewalle 2000 brown et al 2009 one of the dominant impacts of urbanization is increased peak flows and stream flashiness the frequency of high flows is positively correlated with the degree of urbanization of a watershed especially those in warm humid climates poff et al 2006 brown et al 2009 steuer et al 2010 multiple studies have found increasing peak flow volumes and increasing frequencies of high flows over time as watersheds become more urbanized jennings and jarnagin 2002 konrad and booth 2005 white and greer 2006 beighley and moglen 2002 rosburg et al 2017 stream flashiness is positively correlated with urbanization in non arid regions mcmahon et al 2003 poff et al 2006 and flashiness increases over time for streams in urbanizing watersheds dow 2007 the increased flashiness is reflected in a storm recession constant for urban streams that is up to double that of other streams rose and peters 2001 the introduction and expansion of storm drainage systems is a major contributor to increased flashiness miller et al 2014 previous research has shown a weak impact of urbanization on mean annual streamflow increased impervious surfaces should increase storm runoff and thus streamflow but infiltration reduction can lead to reduced dry period flows cuo et al 2008 nevertheless leaks are present in water distribution systems and may provide recharge to shallow aquifers or augmented flows in surface waters meyer 2002 wastewater pipes in a watershed can both increase and decrease streamflow sewer leaks which occur when the pipes are above the water table increases groundwater discharge to streams while sewer infiltration which occurs when pipes are below the water table reduces groundwater discharge to streams meyer 2002 bhaskar et al 2016 infiltration and inflow i i which combines the aforementioned groundwater infiltration with stormwater inflow into wastewater pipes can greatly reduce subsurface water storage in urbanized watersheds bhaskar et al 2015 in addition flow in wastewater pipes may be supplemented by captured streams and springs broadhead et al 2013 spatially extensive water supply and wastewater treatment systems of urbanizing areas often rely upon inter basin transfers diminishing streamflow in one basin and augmenting another zhuang 2016 but also altering groundwater hydraulics in combination with i i schwartz and smith 2014 in addition to streamflow altering infrastructure precipitation variations also can mask expected increasing trends in mean annual streamflow resulting from urbanization annual precipitation and mean annual streamflow are often highly correlated for example annual precipitation totals explain 44 of the variance in streamflow in urbanizing watersheds in the houston texas area rogers and defee 2005 runoff ratios i e streamflow divided by precipitation a commonly used precipitation adjustment metric also have been shown to be significantly positively correlated with precipitation hubbart and zell 2013 therefore runoff ratios do not remove the precipitation effect greater insight into the effects of urbanization on streamflow could be produced if a study compared watersheds over multiple decades while minimizing the influence of inter annual precipitation variability having both multi decadal data and a robust number of watersheds in a region enhances an investigation of environmental causes of streamflow changes dow 2007 therefore the purpose of this study is to examine trends in precipitation adjusted streamflow from 1986 to 2015 in a range of watersheds within an urbanizing metropolitan area 2 study region the selected study region is the atlanta georgia metropolitan area in the piedmont physiographic province in the eastern united states fig 1 atlanta has been one of the fastest growing areas in the united states over the past several decades the population of the metropolitan area i e 29 counties increased from 2 2 million persons in 1980 to 5 3 million persons in 2010 u s census bureau 1996 2017 urban effects on streamflow in the piedmont have been found in multiple studies brun and band 2000 rose and peters 2001 jennings and jarnagin 2002 brandes et al 2005 konrad and booth 2005 brown et al 2009 hopkins et al 2015b comparison studies show that urbanization impacts streamflow in the piedmont more than in other regions especially those regions without natural forest cover brown et al 2009 hopkins et al 2015b the eight streams used in this study are big creek flint river line creek peachtree creek sope creek south river suwanee creek and sweetwater creek table 1 metropolitan atlanta is situated on the eastern sub continental divide of north america and spans three major river basins the

correlated with concentrations of urban development ferguson and ashley 2017 3 material and methods 3 1 population and land cover population housing and land cover data were analyzed to determine changes over approximately twenty years within the eight watersheds as well as the relative differences in ages of sewers gridded population density data for 1990 and 2010 at 100 m and 60 m resolution respectively were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs falcone 2016 national land cover databases nlcd from 1992 2001 and 2011 were acquired from the multi resolution land characteristics mrlc consortium vogelmann et al 2001 homer et al 2015 xian et al 2011 each database had a spatial resolution of 30 m a land cover database with 21 classes was available for 1992 while for 2001 and 2011 there were 16 class land cover databases along with percent developed impervious databases available the nlcd 1992 2001 change retrofit product fry et al 2009 allowed proper comparison between 1992 and 2001 by combining the land cover classes into six general classes agriculture barren developed forest grass shrubland water and wetland estimates of percent imperviousness for the eight watersheds in 1992 were calculated by dividing the percent developed land in 1992 by the mean of the 2001 and 2011 ratios of developed land to developed impervious land finally the mean year of structure completion which was used as a proxy for age of sewers was extracted from american community survey 2011 2015 block group data provided by the u s census bureau 3 2 precipitation precipitation time series from 1986 to 2015 for the eight watersheds were created using precipitation totals at nearby weather stations fig 1 and table 2 monthly precipitation data for 12 stations were extracted from the global historical climatology network database of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration if multiple rain gauges were associated with a station during a month then the median total from those stations was used for that station griffin and winder had 67 and 5 months respectively with missing rainfall totals and those missing values were replaced with mean totals from the closest of the remaining stations an inverse distance weighting scheme was used to estimate watershed precipitation totals from the gauge based totals the weights are shown in table 2 at least four stations were used to estimate monthly precipitation at a watershed since the pooling of data from multiple stations helps minimize the impacts of station specific discontinuities easterling and peterson 1995 3 3 soil water budget a soil water budget was used to determine when water surplus and water deficit typically occur thereby enabling a better understanding of intra annual variations in streamflow an initial budget corresponding to a 0 5 grid cell centered on 34 0 n and 84 5 w was created using the webwimp water budget model http climate geog udel edu wimp willmott et al 1985 the default soil water storage capacity of 150 mm m 1 was not altered but mean month precipitation and temperature data from 1986 to 2015 were used to adjust the model for the study region monthly precipitation totals were the mean of the values from the eight watersheds see section 3 2 mean monthly temperatures were calculated for each watershed using gridded 4 km resolution monthly temperature data acquired from the prism climate group at oregon state university http prism oregonstate edu the final mean monthly temperatures used in the soil water budget model were the mean of the temperatures from the eight watersheds the model produced the following estimates for each month change in soil moisture from the end of the previous month to the end of the current month water deficit i e unmet water demand and surplus water i e surface runoff plus percolation below the plant root zone 3 4 watershed delineation and topography a digital elevation model dem was used to delineate watershed boundaries and compare topographic characteristics among the watersheds the dem had a spatial resolution of 30 m and was acquired from the national elevation dataset of the united states geological survey usgs the watershed tool in arcgis environmental systems research institute was used to delineate the watersheds in addition the mean slope of each watershed was calculated 3 5 streamflow variables multiple streamflow variables for the eight streams were calculated using daily streamflow data daily mean streamflow from 1986 to 2015 were acquired from the usgs while over 50 years of measurements were available at big creek line creek peachtree creek and sweetwater creek this study began in 1986 since the flint river sope creek south river and suwanee creek gauges were installed between 1983 and 1986 table 1 the watersheds i e drainage areas of the eight gauges ranged in size from 79 km2 for sope creek to 615 km2 for sweetwater creek this large range in drainage area is common among urban streamflow studies e g brandes et al 2005 brown et al 2009 rosburg et al 2017 and the disparity in sizes was needed in this study to capture a large range in urban development among the watersheds daily mean streamflow was converted from m3 s 1 to mm by diving by drainage area m2 and then multiplying by the appropriate number seconds to achieve streamflow at multiple temporal scales the following was calculated for each stream 1 annual streamflow 2 annual runoff ratio 3 maximum streamflow 4 baseflow index 5 median streamflow per day of year 6 mean monthly frequencies of high flow days hfds 7 mean and percentile values for hfd streamflow 8 flashiness index and 9 precipitation adjusted annual streamflow and frequencies of hfds maximum streamflow was the median value of the maximum daily streamflow for each of the 30 years and the baseflow index was the mean value of the 30 values of the annual 7 day minimum flow divided by mean daily flow for the year hopkins et al 2015b for this study hfds had daily streamflow above the 95th percentile for the 10 957 days therefore each stream had 547 hfds the r b index was used as the streamflow flashiness index and the index was calculated for each year by dividing the sum of the absolute values of day to day changes in mean daily flow by the total discharge for the year baker et al 2004 the precipitation adjustment of annual streamflow and hfd frequency involved regressing those variables against annual precipitation the resulting residuals i e observed minus predicted which were independent of annual precipitation were then treated as new hydrologic variables e g changnon and demissie 1996 rogers and defee 2005 hubbart and zell 2013 3 6 testing for significant trends and differences the hydroclimate variables were tested for significant trends from 1986 to 2015 as well as significant differences between 1986 2000 and 2001 2015 trends in precipitation streamflow runoff ratio frequency of hfds and flashiness over 1986 2015 were assessed using kendall tau correlation tests α 0 05 one tailed the kendall theil robust line the median of the slopes between all combinations of two points in the data helsel and hirsch 2002 was used to estimate changes over the 30 year period mann whitney u tests α 0 05 one tailed were used to test for significant differences between 1986 2000 and 2001 2015 differences in seasonal frequencies of hfds between 1986 2000 and 2001 2015 also were examined two sample chi square tests α 0 05 were conducted for each epoch hfd combination contingency tables contained the following frequencies 1 hfds during 1986 2000 2 hfds during 2001 2015 3 non hfds during 1986 2000 and 4 non hfds during 2001 2015 3 7 water withdrawal and wastewater discharge water withdrawal and wastewater discharge data were analyzed to better understand changes in streamflow permitted non farm surface water withdrawal values for 2017 were obtained from the georgia department of natural resources environmental protection division 2017 permitted wastewater discharge values for 2006 and projected capacities for 2025 for wastewater treatment facilities were acquired from the 2009 water supply and water conservation plan of the metropolitan north georgia water planning district metropolitan north georgia water planning district 2009 monthly measured wastewater discharge in 2016 and 2017 for the snapfinger and pole bridge wastewater treatment facilities were acquired from dekalb county dekalb county wasteshed management 2017 4 results 4 1 population characteristics of the watersheds the watersheds with the lowest population densities in 1990 had the largest population increases over the following decades table 1 the two northernmost watersheds big creek and suwannee creek had the largest population increases the populations for big creek and suwanee creek nearly quadrupled and tripled respectively from 1990 to 2010 those two watersheds were among the three least densely populated watersheds in 1990 but by 2010 they were close to the mean value for all the watersheds two southern watersheds line creek and sweetwater creek had roughly a doubling of population over the 20 years the four most densely populated watersheds in 1990 peachtree creek south river sope creek and flint river had modest population increases from 1990 to 2010 nevertheless those four watersheds remained the four most densely populated watersheds in 2010 4 2 land cover characteristics of the watersheds population densities are linked to the development of the watershed therefore changes in the amount of developed land were for the most part highly linked with population changes table 1 there was approximately a doubling of developed land in the big creek and suwannee creek watersheds from 1992 to 2011 concomitantly there was also a doubling of impervious surfaces and the 2015 values most likely exceeded 20 for both watersheds the flint river watershed also had relatively large increases in both developed land and impervious surfaces the most developed watersheds in 1992 experienced the smallest growth over the following two decades the peachtree creek watershed the most developed and impervious watershed in 1992 had the smallest increases in developed land 3 and impervious surfaces 2 among all the watersheds the increase in developed land in the eight watersheds came almost entirely at the expense of forest land fig 2 supplementary fig s1 all watersheds lost forest land to development in 1992 developed land and forest land each comprised approximately 990 km2 within the eight watersheds by 2011 the amount of developed land increased by 300 km2 and the amount of forest land decreased by 300 km2 the two most rapidly urbanizing watersheds big creek and suwanee creek were the only two watersheds to transform from majority forest land in 1992 to majority developed land in 2011 the flint river peachtree creek sope creek and south river watersheds have been majority developed land since as late as 1992 line creek and sweetwater creek are on trajectories to becoming majority developed land in the next several decades 4 3 climate and streamflow characteristics the atlanta region has a subtropical humid climate type therefore spring snowmelt is negligible or nonexistent and there are distinct soil moisture surplus and deficit seasons fig 3 a and table 3 the eight watersheds received between 1250 mm and 1300 mm of precipitation annually and precipitation occurred consistently throughout the year over the course of a year the soil water surplus which occurred from december through april greatly exceeded the soil water deficit which occurred from july through september fig 3a despite similar precipitation totals temperatures and watershed slopes among the eight watersheds there were substantial differences in annual streamflow variables table 3 annual streamflow ranged from 407 mm at line creek to 576 mm at south river and those two streams had runoff ratios of 0 31 and 0 45 respectively the southernmost and least developed watersheds line creek and sweetwater creek had the smallest maximum flows while the two most developed watersheds peachtree creek and sope creek had the largest maximum flows line creek and sweetwater creek also had the lowest baseflow index values and on the other extreme was south river with a baseflow index that was nearly twice as high as the next highest value intra annual variations in streamflow at most watersheds related closely to monthly variations in the soil water balance with major discrepancies among the watersheds occurring during the surplus and deficit seasons fig 3 for the streams as a whole streamflow was maximized in late february early march i e the peak of the soil water surplus season and was at a minimum in september which was at the end of the soil water deficit season three major anomalies in fig 4 b are as follows 1 south river had approximately 70 more discharge than the other streams from june through september 2 line creek had approximately 50 less discharge than the other streams from june through september and 3 peachtree creek had approximately 35 less discharge than the other streams from december through april the intra annual variation in occurrence of high flow days was related strongly to climate and development fig 4a over 40 of the high flow days occurred from january through march i e soil water surplus months with march being the peak month july which had 15 more precipitation than the other summer months had the most hfds of the summer months compared to the other streams the most developed streams i e peachtree creek sope creek and south river had approximately 50 more hfds during the soil water deficit months i e july september and approximately 20 fewer hfds during the soil water surplus months i e december april accordingly there was a strong negative relationship between development and intra annual variability in hfd occurrence fig 4c the more developed the watershed the more intense the hfds fig 4b d peachtree creek and sope creek had the largest mean median first quartile and third quartile values for hfd streamflow line creek had the lowest values for those four statistics therefore there was an extremely strong relationship between developed land within a watershed and hfd mean streamflow 4 4 multi decadal changes in streamflow there were no significant trends from 1986 to 2015 in precipitation unadjusted streamflow and runoff ratio at any of the streams watersheds fig 5 a c streamflow was highly correlated i e 0 84 with precipitation and trends in streamflow were more substantial than trends in precipitation runoff ratio also was highly correlated with precipitation as has been found by hubbart and zell 2013 and the inter annual variability in precipitation masked trends in runoff ratio for all eight streams the inter annual variability and trends in streamflow and runoff ratio were nearly identical most of the streams had either significant trends significant inter epochal differences or both for hfds flashiness index hfd residuals or streamflow residuals fig 5d g there were significant positive trends in hfds at big creek and suwanee creek where hfd frequency increased by 101 and 90 respectively over the 30 years the flashiness index had significant positive trends at big creek flint river suwanee creek and sweetwater creek with the percent increases ranging from 20 at sweetwater creek to 66 at suwanee creek these four watersheds had the largest percentage increases in developed land from 1992 to 2011 removing the effects of inter annual precipitation variability revealed significant changes in streamflow and additional significant increases in hfds similar to streamflow hfd frequency also was strongly correlated with precipitation totals streamflow at big creek and suwannee creek increased by 26 while streamflow at peachtree creek decreased by 17 minimizing the influence of precipitation on hfds confirmed the significant increase in hfds at big creek and suwanee creek while revealing a relatively small yet significant increase in hfds at south river 32 increase at the seasonal scale increases in hfds were more common than decreases fig 6 big creek and suwanee creek had significant increases of 200 and 135 respectively in hfds in summer from 1986 2000 to 2001 2015 none of the other increases for stream season combinations were significant the only significant decrease occurred at line creek which experienced a 40 decrease in hfds during winter from 1986 2000 to 2001 2015 increased developed land was strongly positively correlated with mean streamflow hfds and flashiness fig 7 big creek and suwanee creek had much larger increases in percent developed land from 1992 to 2011 than the other watersheds and big creek and suwanee creek had the largest increases in runoff ratio mean streamflow hfds and flashiness from 1986 to 2015 only one other stream south river had increases in all four variables over the 30 years it had a relatively large change in runoff ratio streamflow and hfds with respect to the modest change in developed land in the watershed five streams had decreases in runoff ratio and streamflow with peachtree creek having the largest decreases three streams peachtree creek line creek and sope creek had decreases in hfds and with the exception of line creek streams had increased flashiness over the 30 years 5 discussion increased development of watersheds in the atlanta metropolitan area is the likely cause of increased maximum flows flashiness of streams and decreased intra annual variability in frequencies of hfds figs 4 and 5 significant positive correlations between urbanization and maximum flows have been found previously for atlanta as well as for raleigh milwaukee green bay and dallas fort worth brown et al 2009 the more developed watersheds e g peachtree creek in the atlanta region have had relatively more hfds during the summer than the less developed watersheds e g sweetwater creek thus hfds are distributed more evenly throughout the year in urbanized watersheds urbanization of the big creek and suwanee creek watersheds contributed to substantial increases in streamflow from 1986 to 2015 annual streamflow increased by over 115 mm i e a 26 increase in both watersheds the increased streamflow caused the runoff ratio to increase from approximately 0 35 to 0 45 over the past 30 years the increased streamflow was particularly evident in the increase of hfds the number of hfds increased by approximately 100 for both streams the largest percentage based increases in hfds for big creek and suwanee creek occurred during the summer thereby decreasing the intra annual variability in hfd frequency and making those streams more similar to peachtree creek and sope creek the two most urbanized watersheds the hfd results are similar to what has been found for other urbanizing watersheds in atlanta and watersheds in other parts of the united states among eight small watersheds located in gwinnett county of metropolitan atlanta there was a positive correlation between trends in effective impervious area and trends in peak streamflow and runoff from 2001 to 2008 aulenbach et al 2017 for six urbanizing watersheds examined in baltimore md boston ma and pittsburgh pa there were significant increases in annual frequency of high flow events in all watersheds over periods of at least 40 years precipitation did not increase significantly at any of the watersheds hopkins et al 2015a and in western washington the 95th percentile of daily flows increased by approximately 40 from 1960 to 2010 rosburg et al 2017 inter basin water transfers contributing substantial effluent from two wastewater treatment plants were responsible for the relatively high streamflow especially in the summer at south river table 3 and fig 4 treated wastewater supplements urban streamflow throughout the developed world paul and meyer 2001 with dramatic increases in discharge in arid and semi arid regions dennehy et al 1998 townsend small et al 2013 the present day combined discharge from the snapfinger and pole bridge facilities most of which originated as an inter basin transfer provides approximately 84 mm of additional annual streamflow at the south river gauge this effluent discharge is approximately half the permitted amount table 3 the wastewater effluent increases annual streamflow by up to 15 and thus gives south river an artificially high runoff ratio for example without this excess water the runoff ratio for 2011 2015 would have been 0 35 compared to the actual value of 0 41 wastewater discharge from the two treatment plants might reach 352 000 m3 day 1 i e 270 mm annually in 2025 table 3 and thus add an additional 186 mm annually to the south river and result in an extremely high runoff ratio of 0 55 i i is a possible cause of the relatively low streamflow at peachtree creek during winter and spring as well as the decreasing streamflow over the 30 years during december april when the water table is high peachtree creek has 35 less streamflow i e approximately 54 mm than the other streams annual streamflow for peachtree creek decreased by 100 mm from 1986 to 2015 the peachtree creek watershed which has the highest population density among the watersheds and highest percentage of developed land should have the highest density of sewage pipes moreover the amount of infiltration increases proportionally with the age of the sewer in rödel et al 2017 and much of the housing in the watershed is at least 40 years old table 1 i i has been show to greatly affect the hydrological budget in baltimore another piedmont city with a climate similar to that of atlanta i i is the largest human influence on groundwater levels in the baltimore metropolitan areas with an annual loss of water of 29 mm for the region as a whole and annual losses of hundreds to thousands of mm in some heavily urbanized parts of baltimore bhaskar et al 2015 urbanization and the associated increase in wastewater effluent is the likely cause of the 30 increase in hfd frequency at south river over the past three decades since 1986 the population has increased by at least 12 and the watershed has become at least 9 more developed along with an increase in the amount of impervious cover table 1 similar to peachtree creek and other urbanized watersheds i i is probably a major issue in the south river watershed except that i i water remains in the south river watershed and is eventually discharged at the two wastewater treatment plants upstream of the stream gauge wastewater effluent in general has increased from the two facilities as the watershed population has increased water withdrawals are the likely cause of the relatively low streamflow of line creek this is the only stream with water withdrawals for municipal consumption as a result it has the smallest runoff ratio and baseflow index of all the streams the current permitted water withdrawals total approximately 100 000 m3 day 1 and if fulfilled would reduce annual streamflow by 155 mm table 3 there is relatively little wastewater effluent discharge i e the permitted total is less than 23 000 m3 day 1 to compensate for the above water loss compared with the least impacted stream sweetwater creek streamflow of line creek from 1986 to 2015 was 15 lower direct and indirect water removal from line creek watershed caused streamflow to decrease by 20 from 1986 to 2015 although there was not a significant trend in mean annual streamflow four of the five most negative streamflow residuals occurred in the final eight years of the study period the population of the watershed increased by 130 from 1990 to 2010 table 1 and since 1986 several reservoirs have been constructed within the watershed an existing water treatment plant has been expanded multiple times and a new plant was completed in 2001 fayette county water system 2017 the reservoirs might cause large losses of water even small reservoirs in the southeastern united states can account for considerable evaporative losses severely impacting hydrologic flows especially in drier years ignatius and stallins 2011 in 2016 the newnan utilities pumping station on line creek began increasing water withdrawals by 25 over withdrawals in 2015 newnan utilities 2015 during the second half of 2012 line creek effectively ran dry above the fayette county and newnan utilities water intakes suggesting that both impacts from land use and evaporative losses from small reservoirs may be contributing to extremely low surface flows especially in periods of drought emanuel and rogers 2013 increased water withdrawals land use change including urbanization and increased impoundments in the upper flint river basin such as in line creek are having detrimental impacts downstream including limitations to recreational use in times of drought disruption to environmental flows and extreme low flow events that threaten endemic and endangered species and an increased threat of water scarcity for municipal agricultural and industrial withdrawals emanuel and rogers 2013 emanuel 2014 moreover these impacts further compound the issues in the so called water wars over flows in the acf basin between georgia florida and alabama 6 conclusions the impact of urbanization on multi decadal changes in hydrological variables depends on a variety of factors including climate initial land cover pace of development water withdrawals inter basin transfers wastewater discharges and the extent and age of sewage pipes this study has shown that each of those factors contributed to varying trends in precipitation adjusted streamflow and hfds in the atlanta metropolitan area from 1986 to 2015 while all eight watersheds in the study had increased developed land and impervious surfaces over the 30 years significant increases in streamflow only occurred in the two watersheds that transitioned from majority forest land to majority developed land watersheds that were over 60 developed at the beginning of the period and did not have wastewater discharge actually had declining streamflow with i i being a probable cause these streams also did not have increases in hfds which was more common than increased annual streamflow among the eight streams the only other stream without increases in hfds was the stream with large and increasing water withdrawals for municipal consumption hfd occurrence in the atlanta area peaks in spring and is lowest in summer but urbanization causes a much larger increase in hfds during summer compared to the other seasons therefore the most urbanized watersheds have the smallest intra annual variability in hfds those watersheds also had the most intense hfds the diverse impacts of urbanization on streamflow within the atlanta metropolitan area have undoubtedly been felt by a wide of range of communities increased hfds in urbanizing watersheds such as big creek and suwanee creek contributes to greater vulnerability to flooding in many urban and suburban communities of metropolitan atlanta on the other hand atlanta despite its relatively humid climate and seeming abundance of surface flows is increasingly stressed by the availability of fresh water line creek and other watersheds in the upper flint river have been severely impacted in recent decades by increasing water withdrawals and diminished flows resulting from urbanization especially in periods of drought the compounding downstream effects of diminished flows as exhibited in line creek threaten the water supply of increasing numbers of metro atlanta residents degrade riparian and aquatic habitats and create disconnections in environmental flows moreover both the decreased flows in the upper flint river system and inter basin transfers of water from the chattahoochee basin into the upper south river watershed contribute to escalating interstate conflicts over minimum flows in the acf basin consequently a better understanding of hydraulic and hydrologic processes is essential for planning urban development designing effective infrastructure mitigating pollution and

7542,groundwater management authorities usually use groundwater budget calculations to evaluate the sustainability of withdrawals for different purposes the groundwater budget calculation does not always provide reliable information and it must often be supported by further aquifer monitoring in the case of hydraulic connections between neighboring aquifers the riardo plain aquifer is a strategic drinking resource for more than 100 000 people water storage for 60 km2 of irrigated land and the source of a mineral water bottling plant over a long period the comparison between the direct recharge and the estimated natural outflow and withdrawals highlights a severe water deficit of approximately 40 of the total groundwater outflow a groundwater budget deficit should be a clue to the aquifer depletion but the results of long term water level monitoring allowed the observation of the good condition of this aquifer in fact in the riardo plain the calculated deficit is not comparable to the aquifer monitoring data acquired in the same period 1992 2014 the small oscillations of the groundwater level and the almost stable streambed spring discharge allows the presumption of an additional aquifer recharge source the confined carbonate aquifer locally mixes with the above volcanic aquifer providing an externally stable recharge that reduces the effects of the local rainfall variability the combined approach of the groundwater budget results and long term aquifer monitoring spring discharge and or hydraulic head oscillation provides information about significant external groundwater exchanges even if unidentified by field measurements and supports the stakeholders in groundwater resource management keywords groundwater budget volcanic aquifer carbonate aquifer effective infiltration groundwater exchanges long term aquifer monitoring 1 introduction the increasing imbalance between the water supply and water demand in many parts of europe potentially exacerbated by changes in the climate during the past few decades di matteo et al 2010 water availability and water scarcity have progressively emerged as key issues in national and eu water policy water framework directive 2000 60 ec european commission 2015 and strategy european commission 2007 european commission 2012 european commission 2013 many studies approach the problem of correct exploitation through quantification of the safe yield for an aquifer safe yield is commonly defined as the attainment and maintenance of a long term balance between the amount of groundwater annually withdrawn and the annual amount of recharge hahn et al 1997 sophocleous 2000 it follows that the available groundwater depends on how changes in recharge and discharge affect the surrounding environment alley and leake 2004 it is possible to derive balance equations to relate explicitly the sustainable pumping rate to the natural groundwater recharge zhou 2009 and references therein where the safe yield of an aquifer is often calculated as a percentage of the natural recharge most water management authorities pay higher attention to the results of the groundwater budget in fact building groundwater balances helps to combine and structure the key components of the natural hydrological cycle without human pressures and the relevant inputs and outputs due to human interventions e g abstractions and returns into a coherent framework the different components of the groundwater balance convey information on the state of the inputs and outputs at reference times and their changes according to different reference periods these components are dynamic subject to trends and influenced by natural variation in the amount and timing of precipitation and temperature and anthropogenic drivers e g water abstraction flow regulation and land use change groundwater balances are differently applied today in the european catchment depending mostly on the national laws in italy water balances are developed according to the guidelines for the preparation of the basin water balance reported in the ministry of environment protection decree of 28th july 2004 and following an update in legislative decree 152 2006 decreases in recharge or overexploitation could cause progressive depletion of the groundwater resource and a negative budget discrepancy calderhead et al 2012 maréchal et al 2006 zhou 2009 over the long term the comparison between the amount of recharge and the total outflows natural outflows and withdrawals can provide information about the degree of groundwater resource exploitation capelli et al 2005 generally the overexploitation total outflows natural recharge results in groundwater depletion associated with detrimental effects such as well yield reduction pumping cost increases spring discharge decreases and groundwater level decline custodio et al 2016a b foster et al 2004 konikow 2015 however the groundwater budget could not be calculated without the complete knowledge of the boundary condition of a hydrogeological basin if the considered system is bounded by clear groundwater divides no flux boundaries their positions define the basis of any water management decisions which entail quantifying inflows and outflows genereux et al 2005 the groundwater exchanges with external basins can occur especially where the aquifer boundaries are not clearly defined and thus it becomes more difficult to properly assess the groundwater inflows and outflows filippini et al 2015 in some cases groundwater exchanges are negligible compared to the direct recharge conversely in other cases they could be consistent and generate effects on water quality or significant discrepancies in the groundwater budget mastrorillo and petitta 2014 moreover in some thick and fractured aquifers contributions of vertical flow from depth could be significant in terms of available resources in these cases the exploitation could have low or negligible impacts and groundwater levels and spring flow rates might remain unchanged due to the hydraulic connection with neighboring aquifers these hidden and scarcely quantifiable inflows could constitute a major portion of the available groundwater resource carrillo rivera 2000 in conclusion the balance equation depends on three main components the natural recharge effective infiltration the anthropogenic induced activities and the relationship of the studied system with neighboring basins external groundwater inflow and outflow in the presence of significant external groundwater exchanges not assumed in the conceptual model the results of only the groundwater budget calculation could not be reliable precisely because of the high uncertainty of the non measurable groundwater exchanges the combined results of the groundwater budget and the aquifer monitoring spring discharge or hydraulic head measurements over a long time could provide more information about the aquifer conditions and could support the definition of a new hydrogeological conceptual model these circumstances seem to be present in the riardo plain aquifer which is a strategic drinking resource for more than 100 000 people water storage for 60 km2 of irrigated land and the source of a mineral water bottling plant viaroli et al 2016c in this area located in southern italy water supply operators have expressed concerns about the potential impact of the strong and prolonged exploitation for conjunctive purposes on the future availability of groundwater resources autorità di bacino dei fiumi liri garigliano e volturno 2008 the present study aims to contribute to improving the knowledge of the recharge processes of the riardo plain aquifer in order to verify the actual aquifer conditions and continue its exploitation without risking abrupt groundwater depletion for this purpose a simplified approach was used to evaluate the average annual and monthly groundwater budgets over twenty three years 1992 2014 and to calculate the monthly mean distribution of the effective infiltration the yearly mean groundwater withdrawals were also evaluated the obtained results were compared with both the groundwater levels outflow variations and the precipitation variability measured in the same monitoring interval a new simplified hydrogeological conceptual model of the riardo plain aquifer was also proposed to better define the hypothetical groundwater recharge processes given the complexity of the hydrogeological setting of the study area the groundwater recharge model suggested was presented in its most simplified form and will inevitably have to be deepened by further studies nevertheless the first results achieved are already enough for supporting stakeholder decisions and directing future investigations the proposed case study highlights the groundwater budget calculation of the aquifer affected by the hydraulic connection between neighboring aquifers such as the riardo plain aquifer and is useful for the preliminary identification of the groundwater exchanges which are often very complicated to quantify in fact the underestimation or the overestimation of the external exchanges could significantly affect groundwater withdrawal management thus increasing the socioeconomic costs and the risk of overexploitation according to the results of this study a combined approach with the groundwater budget calculation and long term aquifer monitoring spring discharge and or groundwater level is recommended in order to reduce this uncertainty and to better evaluate the sustainability of the withdrawals for wise water management in this approach the aquifer recharge and exploitation are quantified by the groundwater budget calculation whereas the aquifer conservation status is defined by the long term monitoring this coupled control allows the identification of potential anomalies related to not otherwise recognizable groundwater inflows or outflows 2 geological and hydrogeological framework the concerned area is located in the northern campania region southern italy and corresponds to the eastern slope of the roccamonfina volcano and the riardo plain an intermountain basin formed during the apennine chain orogenesis the carbonate southern apennines are mainly made up of the lias cretaceous shelf limestone succession with a thickness of approximately 1500 m d argenio and pescatore 1962 from the messinian to early lower pliocene the sedimentary succession was affected by a compressive tectonic stage orogenesis of the apennine chain especially during the upper tortonian when the study area corresponded to the foredeep basin and sin orogenic flysch deposition occurred selli 1957 the widespread miocene flysch units cover the older mesozoic limestone successions and are the stratigraphic basement of the roccamonfina volcano capuano et al 1992 saroli et al 2017 subsequently an extensional tectonic stage lower pliocene upper pleistocene produced a horst and graben structure which extended in the nw se direction and is dislocated in the ne sw direction chiappini et al 1998 the dislocation of the sedimentary basement formed the tectonic basin of the riardo plain subsequently filled by volcanic units pleistocene holocene volcanoclastic deposits and actual alluvial units the roccamonfina volcano activity started approximately 550 ka triggered by the extensional tectonic activity and ended approximately 150 ka surrounding carbonate and marls horsts of the cretaceous age form the lateral margins of the basin in which the roccamonfina has developed rouchon et al 2008 the volcanic activity is subdivided into three main epochs de rita et al 1997 the first epoch is mainly characterized by effusive activity with the emission of sub saturated lava flows and by the growing of the stratovolcano and several small volcanic centers the second activity epoch started approximately 350 ka rouchon et al 2008 is characterized by a succession of highly explosive eruptions and the emplacement of pyroclastic units giannetti and de casa 2000 luhr and giannetti 1987 during the third phase minor phreatomagmatic activity and latitic lava domes were emplaced de rita and giordano 1996 giannetti 1964 1996 borehole data in the riardo plain highlight the local absence of the flysch deposits in the eastern peripheral sector of the roccamonfina volcano and the direct deposition of the volcanic units over the carbonate basement the thickness of the volcanic deposits in the riardo plain is extremely variable according to the pre volcanic morphology and ranges from a few meters near the carbonate ridges to more than 250 m detected in a borehole in the ferrarelle s p a bottling plant moving toward the volcano edifice geophysical data capuano et al 1992 suggested an increase in the deepening of the sedimentary basement in correspondence with the roccamonfina volcano edifice where several hundred meters of lava deposits emplaced during the first phase of the volcanic activity are expected the hydrostructure of the roccamonfina volcano hosts a regional centrifugal aquifer which constitutes an open hydrogeological unit towards the surrounding plains the roccamonfina volcano s7 in fig 1 recharge area approximately 350 km2 feeds several springs up to a total discharge of 2 1 m3 s including the savone linear spring of approximately 1 2 m3 s and groundwater leakage is estimated to be approximately 2 m3 s boni et al 1986 the volcanic hydrostructure is surrounded by five carbonate hydrogeological units u1 u2 u3 s6 and the southern portion of the g2 units each carbonate hydrostructure mainly discharges towards productive springs located at its edge with rates higher than 1 m3 s boni et al 1986 fig 1 recent hydrogeological studies on the roccamonfina volcano viaroli et al 2016b also suggest the distinction between the groundwater circulation in the caldera and the basal volcanic aquifer in addition along the eastern slope of the roccamonfina volcano some low productive aquifers perched on a shallow aquitard low permeability pyroclastic deposits were identified viaroli et al 2016a these aquifers usually feed a few small seasonal springs the volcanic aquifer is recharged from the upper portion of the volcano edifice and groundwater moves radially toward the riardo plain where it feeds the savone linear spring at an elevation between 90 and 40 m a s l viaroli et al 2016c in the riardo plain the volcanic aquifer overlaps a deeper fractured carbonate aquifer characterized by high secondary porosity the carbonate aquifer is mainly recharged by the eastern portion of the volcano edifice capelli et al 1999 cuoco et al 2010 the two aquifers can be clearly distinguished in the eastern sector of the plain where the flysch unit covers the carbonate substratum and plays the role of an aquiclude consequently carbonate and volcanic aquifers show different hydraulic heads and opposite flow directions viaroli et al 2016c in contrast hydraulic connections were recognized near the town of riardo where the intersection of different fault systems and the absence of the flysch units allow the uprising of deep fluids cuoco et al 2010 in this sector the carbonate and volcanic hydraulic head have the same elevation between 140 and 60 m a s l and the mixing with co2 supersaturated fluids forms the local mineral water type the geochemical composition of the volcanic aquifer confirms that the mineralization process depends only on the water volcanic rock interaction the deeper carbonate aquifer shows both carbonate and volcanic features i e alkali metals silica fe and as as a consequence of the mineralization processes occurring during groundwater evolution during the groundwater transfer from the recharge area roccamonfina volcano to the riardo plain the groundwater interacts not only with volcanic units but also with carbonate rocks cuoco et al 2010 wherever the elevation of the sedimentary basement reached the volcanic groundwater flow path elevation fig 2 under these conditions the two aquifers carbonate and volcanic could then be considered a single large basal groundwater circulation with chemistry variations according to the depth called the basal aquifer from the climatic point of view the study area is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate with dry and warm summers from june to august and a wet period that occurs during autumn winter and spring from september to april ducci and tranfaglia

northern campania region is approximately 1000 mm with a coefficient of variation of approximately 0 3 the air temperature has a similar trend in all meteorological stations with some differences

ferrarelle s p a 2015 dataset regione campania 2015a b 2 1 study area the study area corresponds to the eastern slope of the roccamonfina volcano and the western sector of the riardo plain where hydraulic connections were recognized between the volcanic and the carbonate portion of the basal aquifer the groundwater balance reference area has an extension of approximately 100 km2 fig 3 and most of the boundaries were defined as the groundwater divides of the volcanic aquifer the southeastern boundary corresponds to the outcrop of the m coricuzzo carbonate relief which does not seem to be in connection with the aquifer in the plain viaroli et al 2016c in this area the water table of the basal aquifer shows depths ranging from at least 200 meters on the volcano edifice to 0 m where the savone streambed spring outflow in the western sector of the riardo plain seven hydrogeological complexes were defined modified from allocca et al 2007 capelli et al 1999 mazza et al 2013 viaroli et al 2016a of which only five outcrop in the reference area alluvia complex this complex is composed of reworked sediments deposited at the base of slopes or in the fluvial valley these deposits could host aquifers due to the high primary porosity dolomite complex no outcropping in the reference area this complex corresponds to the dolomite unit at the bottom of the sedimentary sequence the dolomite complex is characterized by average secondary porosity therefore it plays the role of aquitard for the carbonate aquifer limestone complex this complex corresponds to the limestone units and is characterized by high secondary porosity according to fractioning and karst processes this complex hosts the carbonate aquifer flysch complex no outcropping in the reference area this complex is composed of sands and clays deposited in the foredeep basin this complex is characterized by overall low hydraulic conductivity and it plays the role of aquiclude between the volcanic and carbonate aquifers lava complex this complex corresponds to all lava and lava dome units mainly characterized by high hydraulic conductivity due to cooling fractures these units could also serve as a local aquiclude where they appear nearly unfractured fine grained pyroclastic complex this complex is composed of lithified pyroclastic deposits and ashy matrix pyroclastic deposits due to its low hydraulic conductivity this complex is a local aquitard separating aquifer layers hosted in the permeable volcanic complex coarse grained pyroclastic complex this complex includes all other pyroclastic deposits characterized by little higher porosity than the other pyroclastic units this complex hosts the volcanic aquifer due to average primary porosity the groundwater budget parameters were calculated for the basal aquifer and recharged by direct rainfall infiltration of the roccamonfina volcano slope according to the riardo plain hydrogeological framework described above this aquifer has proven to be rather productive with transmissivity values ranging from 10e 3 volcanic portion of the basal aquifer to 10e 2 carbonate circulation unpublished aquifer pumping tests by ferrarelle s p a and it is

al 2016c covers approximately 100 km2 the time interval for which the groundwater budget was calculated corresponds to 23 years from 1992 to 2014 given the large size of the area and the length of the observation period inevitably the inflow and outflow terms of the budget lack spatial and temporal homogeneity the longest available time series were preferred even if not always continuous in order to omit the quantification of the aquifer storage variations which can be neglected if compared to the other budget terms over such a long period custodio and llamas 2005 the next paragraphs of this chapter explain how the problems about heterogeneous data were overcome on a case by case basis the groundwater budget terms were defined both at the mean monthly and at mean yearly scales according to the available data and distinguished based on the inflow and outflow terms the unique inflow term corresponds to the effective infiltration calculated from thermo pluviometric data it was verified that lateral inflows in the aquifers from rivers are negligible in fact according to previous hydrogeological survey results università degli studi roma tre 1999 università degli studi roma tre 2014 viaroli et al 2016b the savone river unique perennial river in the reference area is not in hydraulic connection with the aquifer along the volcano slope where the low permeability fine grained pyroclastic complex outcrops fig 3 in contrast in the riardo plain several streambed springs are present in correspondence with the outcrops of the aquifer complex coarse grained pyroclastic complex no losing portions of the savone river were detected in the field since most of the water pumped in the basin is used for irrigation part of it can return to the aquifer by direct infiltration in this work the agricultural return flow was considered not relevant according to land use information approximately 70 of the irrigated areas corresponds to fruit trees for which no return flow was assumed since these crops use drip irrigation techniques that eliminate irrigation losses maréchal et al 2006 the absence of paddy fields and irrigation channels allows this possible additional inflow term to be neglected the outflow terms consist of natural outflows discharge of savone streambed springs and artificial outflows groundwater withdrawals the main difficulties were found in the assessment of these terms because of both the lack of continuous monitoring of the savone river baseflow and the absence of an official database about withdrawals for agricultural purposes this set of problems is also discussed in the next paragraphs on a case by case basis in conclusion the classical groundwater budget equation input output δs in this work is stated as follows e i n d w t δ s where ei effective infiltration is the parameter quantifying the amount of rainfall that is involved in the aquifer recharge nd natural discharge corresponds to the total discharge of the springs fed by the aquifer wt artificial discharge corresponds to the sum of the agricultural industrial and drinking withdrawals and δs is the aquifer storage variation neglected in this work according to the long time interval of the budget calculation 3 1 1 inflow the groundwater budget inflow terms were computed from daily thermo pluviometric data of local weather stations placed in the northern campania region the data acquired from several databases dataset ferrarelle s p a 2015 dataset regione campania 2015a b have a time range of 15 years from 2000 to 2014 except for the riardo ferrarelle and roccamonfina weather stations whose locations are shown in fig 3 which have a dataset recorded in the 1992 2014 interval the monthly thermo pluviometric dataset resulting from the aggregation of the daily data at a monthly scale presents gaps in each weather station due to different periods of activity or to technical malfunctions of the instruments the missing data were reconstructed according to the correlation of the contemporaneous data of nearby stations only the correlations with a r2 0 85 were taken into account to fill the gaps finally cumulate monthly rainfall and mean monthly temperature were calculated for all weather stations the mean monthly actual evapotranspiration the water surplus and the water deficit were calculated using thornthwaite s method thornthwaite and mather 1957 for each weather station the punctual results of the water surplus were then geostatistically interpolated considering the existing correlation of the weather variables with the ground elevation cokriging was applied using gis to spatialize the data the monthly effective infiltration as the portion of the water surplus that can infiltrate was calculated multiplying the monthly distributed water surplus with the coefficients of potential infiltration weighted with the slope c i p s the infiltration potential coefficients c i p celico 1988 evaluate the range of the amount in percent of the water surplus which could infiltrate according to the physical properties of the outcropping soils or rocks e g porosity and permeability c i p values were associated with the outcropping volcanic and sedimentary complexes described table 1 according to previous studies autorità di bacino dei fiumi liri garigliano e volturno 2008 celico 1988 to include the effect of the morphology on infiltration the raster map of c i p distribution was multiplied by the slope map s in and calculated from the digital elevation model map with 50 meters of resolution in gis the raster maps were then combined via map algebraic operations the c i p s were calculated cell by cell according to the following relationship c i p s c i p 1 s 100 the maps of the monthly distribution of the effective infiltration were realized taking in account the distribution of the c i p s and the distributed monthly water surplus the elaborations were clipped according the boundaries of the recharge area 3 1 2 outflows in the groundwater budget calculation the recharge was compared with the main groundwater outflows the natural discharge of savone linear springs and the groundwater withdrawals for different purposes it is assumed that the baseflow rate of the savone river measured at the closing section during dry periods corresponds with the total groundwater natural outflows data regarding river discharge were collected during specific hydrogeological surveys autorità di bacino dei fiumi liri garigliano e volturno 2008 università degli studi roma tre 1999 università degli studi roma tre 2014 carried out at least one week after the last significant rainfall event to exclude runoff from the assessment of the baseflow from available data it was possible to assess the groundwater natural outflow for each hydrogeological survey withdrawal data were collected from several databases and separately elaborated according to the different purposes data about drinking water withdrawals were collected from autorità di bacino dei fiumi liri garigliano e volturno 2008 where information supplied from the technical bureau of the municipalities and from the aqueduct district database ato 2 napoli volturno regione campania 2003 is reported withdrawals for industrial purposes were calculated from the information of the industries and services census dataset istat 2011 at the municipal scale the daily groundwater requirement for each employee was assessed according to the ateco classification dataset istat 2007 of all productive activities placed in the study area the withdrawals of the mineral water bottling activity were included in this category information about withdrawals for agricultural purposes are not present in any specific database the previous hydrogeological studies autorità di bacino dei fiumi liri garigliano e volturno 2008 capelli et al 1999 assumed that the agricultural withdrawals were at least the difference between the water requirement for the plantations and the available water the authors calculated the plantation water requirements on the different plant species distributed according to the land use information european environment agency 2000 dataset istat 1994 nino and fais 2001 in the present study groundwater withdrawal for irrigation purposes was set equal to the mean monthly water deficit calculated using thornthwaithe s method in agricultural areas and equal to zero elsewhere the agricultural withdrawals were thus calculated from water requirements of the plantation without distinguishing among the different species a small agricultural portion of the study area is irrigated through the sannio alifano consortium which takes water from outside the studied area as since 2011 this external water contribution is taken into account in the budget calculation according to the information supplied by the consortium 3 2 aquifer monitoring the hydrogeological budget results were compared to the groundwater levels trend measured almost every 15 days since the 90s dataset ferrarelle s p a 2016 in order to evaluate any possible effect of groundwater exploitation during the considered time interval among the several monitored points two significant wells pzc and pzv placed in the ferrarelle mineral water bottling plant fig 3 were chosen the hydraulic head level measured in the selected wells are characterized by the same oscillations in magnitude and in time measured in the other wells in addition these two wells provide the longest and most complete time series pzv is an approximately 60 m deep monitoring well tapping the volcanic portion of the basal aquifer pzc is an approximately 250 m deep monitoring well tapping the carbonate portion of the basal aquifer 3 3 climatic trend analysis the standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 1995 is a powerful flexible index to analyze the occurrence and the magnitude of drought periods world meteorological organization 2012 the spi was designed to quantify the precipitation deficit for multiple timescales according to the different water resource dynamics the spi is defined for each timescale as follows spi x i x σ x where xi is the monthly rainfall amount x is the arithmetic mean of rainfall and σ x is the standard deviation calculated from the whole monthly time series positive spi values indicate a greater than median precipitation wetter periods and negative values indicate less than median precipitation drier periods mckee et al 1993 a drought event occurs any time the spi is continuously negative and reaches an intensity of at least 1 the event ends when the spi becomes positive the spi can be calculated from 1 month up to 72 months but statistically 1 24 months is the best practical range of application guttman 1998 1999 few studies have explored the correlation between the groundwater level variations mendicino et al 2008 bloomfield and marchant 2013 bloomfield et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 or the spring discharge variations fiorillo and guadagno 2010 2012 to spi the authors suggested different statistical elaborations to standardize the aquifer oscillations such as the groundwater resource index mendicino et al 2008 standardized groundwater level index bloomfield and marchant 2013 and standardized streamflow index vicente serrano et al 2012 the results of all methods applied at the catchment scale over multiple long term monitoring datasets agree with the importance of having a high density of hydrological and climatic data to understand the effects of the precipitation variability according to the sub basin hydrogeological properties in this study the non uniform spatial distribution and the scarcity of long term hydrological monitoring datasets do not allow detailed statistical elaborations over the entire catchment therefore the spi was used to highlight the precipitation variability over the groundwater budget calculation period also focusing on the presence of drought periods to compare with the aquifer oscillations the climatic elaboration was realized by taking into account the precipitation time series of the riardo ferrarelle meteorological station which guarantees rainfall data from 1980 without significant interruptions dataset ferrarelle s p a 2015 the available dataset was transformed into a normalized distribution and then standardized i e mean spi equal to 0 the rainfall data were elaborated using a 12 month time scale spi12 since it better represents long term precipitation patterns and is better tied to groundwater resource dynamics fiorillo and guadagno 2010 world meteorological organization 2012 4 results 4 1 groundwater budget calculation the annual rainfall data measured in the eight weather stations in the northern campania region show a wide range from approximately 580 mm in 2000 to approximately 1600 mm measured in 2009 the mean monthly rainfall data calculated over the 2000 14 period shows a similar trend for the eight stations fig 4 with a decrease in monthly rainfall from january to august a quick increase during the autumn and maximum precipitation in november the mean temperature trend is common to all monitored weather stations characterized by cold winters and warm summers relative differences in the temperature are only related to the station elevation according to a linear relationship r2 0 85 in fig 4 the monthly mean water surplus ws is also represented calculated according to ws p ev where p is the mean monthly rainfall and ev corresponds to the monthly actual evapotranspiration calculated using thornthwaite s method the groundwater recharge is possible only when ws is not zero in all weather stations the recharge period was identified between november and april with one exception starting in december from may to october the actual evapotranspiration exceeds the rainfall with a consequent progressive depletion of the initial amount of soil water during july and august the available soil water turns to zero and the higher evapotranspiration demand causes a water deficit the water deficit and the available water in the soil are restored by the autumnal precipitation at the grazzanise weather station the ws was identified only from december to april due to a lower amount of autumnal rainfall the geostatistical interpolation of the monthly water surplus and water deficit values calculated for each weather station allowed the extension of the values to the whole recharge area the results of the cokriging between the eight weather stations in the 2000 14 period were compared to the results of the same procedure applied only to the roccamonfina and riardo ferrarelle meteorological stations which began taking measurements in 1992 the comparison highlighted only minor differences and the usual overestimation of the water surplus approximately 3 in the elaboration using only two stations concerning the reliability of the elaboration the monthly ws and water deficit were calculated using the roccamonfina and riardo ferrarelle datasets over a twenty three year 1992 2014 interval the results are reported in table 2 the spatial distribution of the c i p s fig 5 allowed the identification of the areas where the effective infiltration prevails over the surface runoff these areas correspond to the eastern portion of the study area where the alluvial deposits of the riardo plain outcrop and the zones where lava and limestone outcrop over the roccamonfina volcano flank the c i p s values range from 93 to 21 with a mean value of approximately 55 the spatial distribution of the mean monthly effective infiltration fig 6 in the study area was calculated relating the c i p s raster with the raster distribution of the monthly mean water surplus the summary of the mean monthly values of the recharge parameters is reported in table 3 over the recharge area approximately 100 km2 wide the mean annual effective infiltration 233 mm y guarantees a renewable groundwater resource of 740 l s per year the mean annual effective infiltration calculated over the study area corresponds to approximately 25 of the mean annual precipitation similar to the results of regional hydrogeological studies over the other perithyrrenic quaternary volcanic domains baiocchi et al 2008 boni et al 1986 capelli et al 2005 the groundwater outflows from the hydrogeological system could be divided into natural discharges of the aquifer and anthropogenic withdrawals the natural outflow is assumed to be represented by the savone linear spring discharge at elevations between 120 and 40 m a s l fig 3 the baseflow of the savone is approximately 470 l s with minimum discharges measured in july 315 l s in 1998 200 l s in 2002 and 330 l s in 2013 the withdrawals can be distinguished and calculated according to the different uses the quantification of the agricultural withdrawals is one of the most important and complicated terms of the budget to be quantified tsanis and apostolaki 2009 venezian scarascia et al 2006 additional difficulties in agricultural withdrawal evaluation is the absence of an irrigation consortium which could provide local and reliable information on the water distribution on the entire study area and the absence of surface water resources including artificial accumulation reservoirs which correspond to the greatest source of water for irrigation todorovic et al 2007 nevertheless it is important to underline that the knowledge about groundwater resources is far from accurate due to frequent non authorized water abstraction for irrigation especially in the southern regions todorovic et al 2007 this study attempted to compare the monthly water surplus and the water deficit in the 1992 2014 period fig 7 the groundwater extraction required for the plantations life was preliminarily and conservatively evaluated equal to the water deficit the presence of a water deficit was detected in july and august months in which evapotranspiration exceeds the rainfall amount but with no more water apparent in the soil thus it seems reasonable to assume that irrigation is necessarily performed in order to avoid plant desiccation the agricultural withdrawals were calculated according to the monthly water deficit distributed over the 60 km2 irrigated areas approximately 60 of the study area fig 3 the estimated groundwater withdrawals for agricultural purposes are summarized in table 4 this outflow represents only a rough estimate since it is based on the local climatic conditions and not on the actual pumping rates of private wells these values fluctuate from 655 l s in 2003 the driest year of the considered period to 219 l s in 1995 with an average value of approximately 420 l s approximately 40 l s shall be subtracted in the 2011 14 interval to take into account the irrigation water from the external area provided by the bonifica sannio alifano consortium in conclusion a net agricultural withdrawal of approximately 395 l s was assumed a limited number of industrial activities are located in the study area the calculated industrial withdrawals is approximately 60 l s the mean value of the mineral water bottling activity was included in this withdrawal category reaching a mean withdrawal of approximately 50 l s during the study period most of the drinking wells that exploit the study aquifer fed the local population approximately 30 000 people with a rate of few liters per second table 5 six highly productive wells with a total constant pumping rate of 240 l s located near the town of teano teano s giulianeta are connected to the northern campanian aqueduct which feeds three cities external to the studied area the teano s giulianeta well field has been active since 1992 with a constant withdrawal rate during the study period the potential number of people fed by the riardo plain hydrogeological system reaches 100 000 units corresponding to a calculated withdrawal for human consumption of approximately 300 l s in table 6 all parameters of the groundwater budget calculation are summarized the estimation of the budget terms highlights a groundwater deficit of approximately 485 l s the calculated deficit is very high and surely wider than the calculation uncertainties 4 2 analysis of the precipitation trend the computed spi values are reported in fig 8 the drought and wet periods are defined according to the classification system proposed by mckee et al 1993 the first portion 1980 85 of the precipitation is characterized by an alternate moderately wet 1 spi12 1 49 and moderately dry periods 1 49 spi12 1 during the following 13 years significant wet periods are not detected only a moderately dry period between 1988 93 is evident the time interval period of the groundwater budget calculation is a characterized variable pattern an initial extremely dry period spi12 2 following a near normal moderately dry period 0 99 spi12 0 99 starting from 2008 there is a significant change in the precipitation regime with the presence of extremely wet spi12 2 and very wet 1 5 spi12 1 99 periods it is important to emphasize that significant wet periods are missing from 1985 to 2008 23 years the precipitation trend calculated in the riardo plain is similar to the results of other climatic studies realized in the same region the extremely dry period detected in the first 00 is the strictest drought period in magnitude and duration starting from 1930 fiorillo and guadagno 2010 5 discussion during the study period 1992 2014 the hydrogeological system in question provided a mean discharge of approximately 1200 l s calculated as the sum of natural and artificial outflows in the same period a mean effective infiltration of approximately 740 l s was calculated the results highlight a significant groundwater deficit 485 l s which is around 40 of the total discharge in an intensively exploited hydrogeological system for conjunctive purposes such a groundwater deficit would be an indicator of overexploitation of the aquifer on the assumption that the limits of the riardo plain hydrogeological system are a lateral no flux boundary corresponding to groundwater divides identified on the potentiometric map this overall scenario should be reflected in the unavoidable aquifer depletion as was observed in the last decades in other volcanic aquifers of central italy capelli et al 2005 mazza and mastrorillo 2013 mazza et al 2014 2015 the case study of 23 years of monitoring of groundwater levels of the basal aquifer fig 9 showed annual oscillations according to the seasonal variability of the recharge but not the expected decrease in the water table elevation indeed fig 9 does not note any aquifer depletion despite the outflows being much higher than the inflows in addition the near constancy of the savone baseflow confirms the absence of a significant groundwater deficit the minimum baseflow values measured at the beginning july 1998 315 l s and at the end july 2013 330 l s of the observation period are very similar furthermore the qualitative comparison of the available minimum discharge rates of the savone baseflow with the groundwater levels seems to depict a direct relationship fig 9 finally although the total aquifer outflows natural plus artificial are greater than the calculated recharge more than twenty years later they still have not triggered depletion of the aquifer then the presence of an additional lateral recharge from external hydrostructures can be supposed according to the hydrogeological setting of the study area nevertheless the budget results allow the formulation of a first estimation of the external groundwater inflow that should be comparable at least to the budget discrepancy i e approximately 485 l s this result means that the aquifer would present a combined recharge deriving from the direct zenithal infiltration for approximately 60 and from external inflows for approximately 40 the effects of the direct infiltration are evidenced by the relationship between the spi12 calculated on the precipitation data of riardo ferrarelle meteorological station and the groundwater level monitoring fig 10 it is worth noting the response of the aquifer system to the precipitation regime starting from 1985 near normal or moderately dry periods were detected an extremely dry period was detected from 1998 to 2002 the final period 2008 14 was characterized by a quick increase in the precipitation amount defining extremely wet and very wet periods the groundwater level trend shows annual oscillation according to the cyclic annual recharge and a progressive decrease until 2008 when the dry periods are followed by the first extremely wet period despite the significant changes in the precipitation the groundwater level variations in the monitoring period were quite moderate in fact the volcanic portion of the basal aquifer with a mean thickness of approximately 150 meters presents a maximum groundwater level variation of approximately 4 meters which corresponds to less than the 3 of the aquifer thickness the same consideration could not be made for the carbonate sector of the basal aquifer because information regarding the total thickness of the limestone was not available a thickness of approximately 80 meters of the saturated limestone was detected by borehole data giordano et al 1995 viaroli et al 2016c this very conservative information suggests a maximum variation of the aquifer thickness below 5 these groundwater level oscillations result in lower than other overexploited porous or volcanic aquifers in southern europe capelli et al 2005 custodio et al 2016a d alessandro et al 2011 kazakis 2014 mazza et al 2014 in which tens of meters of drawdown were observed this situation could suggest the presence of a continuous external contribution from neighboring hydrogeological systems that have good storage and self regulation capabilities these hydrodynamic attitudes are necessary to ensure a continuous and constant additional recharge capable of smoothing the large seasonal and annual changes in direct zenithal infiltration the results obtained to date allowed the proposal of a new simplified conceptual model of the groundwater recharge of the riardo plain basal aquifer fig 11 the structural setting of the sedimentary basement is characterized by a horst and graben structure due to the extensional tectonic activity which dislocated the carbonate blocks most of the water infiltrated into the carbonate relief drains toward the main springs placed outside the study system the remaining part of the water may supply the confined circulation in the deep fractured carbonate blocks beneath the considered basal aquifer according to the hydrogeological setting the two aquifers can be clearly distinguished in the eastern sector of the plain where the flysch unit covers the carbonate substratum and plays the role of aquiclude the study area is located in the wester sector of the plain where the flysch complex is not always present and a single groundwater circulation basal aquifer recharged by roccamonfina volcano was identified viaroli et al 2016c this peculiar setting facilitates the inflow of underlying semiconfined carbonate groundwater towards the overlying basal aquifer where the difference in the hydraulic heads permits it therefore it is reasonable that the studied aquifer could receive the greatest increase in recharge from the underlying carbonate units in correspondence with the mineral spring area where the extensional fault systems and the absence of the intermediate aquiclude allows the uprising of deep fluids in correspondence with the concession area of the mineral water bottle plant cuoco et al 2010 at present it seems premature to assign an exact provenance to this external recharge nevertheless it is reasonable to invoke the role of the carbonate ridges surrounding the roccamonfina volcano and the riardo plain which host several productive aquifers feeding spring systems outside the study area allocca et al 2007 boni et al 1986 according to the literature data about the effective infiltration values of these carbonate hydrostructures ranging from 706 to 888 mm year indicate that the external recharge area needed to feed 485 l s seeming groundwater deficit should cover between 16 to 20 km2 such an extension is a small percentage of the total area of the carbonate hydrostructures surrounding the riardo plain more than 1000 km2 therefore the identification of the recharge area based only on the groundwater budget is unlikely the external water inflow amount is actually comparable with the uncertainties in the calculation of the carbonate hydrostructure budgets which involve several m3 s to prove the hypothesis suggested and to make the conceptual model more realistic further investigation of both the local hydrogeological setting and the groundwater flow path of carbonate hydrostructures surrounding the study area is needed for this purpose a close cooperation between structural geologists and hydrogeochemists is desirable 6 conclusions the results of the groundwater budget calculation can provide information about the sustainability of the anthropogenic activities on the groundwater resources combining the groundwater budget calculation with long term aquifer monitoring it was possible to provide preliminary indications about advice on the aquifer boundary conditions and information about the impact of the estimated withdrawals on the available groundwater resources in fact the groundwater budget calculation on the riardo plain aquifer highlights a significant groundwater deficit approximately 40 with no correspondence to any significant depletion of the groundwater resource as shown in the long term aquifer monitoring the length of the calculation period more than twenty years 1992 2014 reasonably allows the exclusion of the effect of storage and transience of the study aquifer slight uncertainties regarding the appropriate identification of the recharge area are limited by the groundwater divides identified on the potentiometric map and the estimation of some budget parameters these drawbacks do not justify such a great negative budget discrepancy this anomaly could be explained by the presence of a hydraulic connection with a continuous external inflow from neighboring hydrostructures the aquifers that provide the additional recharge should have a large extension good storage and self regulation capabilities in order to be able to smooth the effects of the intense variability of the local zenithal infiltration the proposed hydrogeological model suggests an additional groundwater recharge similar to the calculated groundwater deficit this additional recharge comes from the underlying carbonate units which in turn were recharged by the carbonate reliefs surrounding the roccamonfina volcano and the riardo plain in correspondence with the mineralized spring area extensional fault systems and the absence of the intermediate aquiclude make possible the rise and the mixing of groundwater under pressure in conclusion a groundwater budget deficit is not necessarily an indication of aquifer depletion but is evidence of external groundwater inflow which has not been previously discussed these first achievements provided the basis for the following research steps the main objective of which would certainly be an identification of the exact provenance of the external recharge generally ascribed to the surrounding carbonate reliefs the complete understanding of the deep groundwater inflow requires other fundamental information inferable from stable isotope analysis δ2h δ18o more detailed groundwater budget calculation and structural measurements of the surrounding carbonate reliefs according to several authors baiocchi et al 2013 la vigna et al 2016 pola et al 2015 numerical modelling could be a powerful tool to test conceptual models in particular in the study area

7542,groundwater management authorities usually use groundwater budget calculations to evaluate the sustainability of withdrawals for different purposes the groundwater budget calculation does not always provide reliable information and it must often be supported by further aquifer monitoring in the case of hydraulic connections between neighboring aquifers the riardo plain aquifer is a strategic drinking resource for more than 100 000 people water storage for 60 km2 of irrigated land and the source of a mineral water bottling plant over a long period the comparison between the direct recharge and the estimated natural outflow and withdrawals highlights a severe water deficit of approximately 40 of the total groundwater outflow a groundwater budget deficit should be a clue to the aquifer depletion but the results of long term water level monitoring allowed the observation of the good condition of this aquifer in fact in the riardo plain the calculated deficit is not comparable to the aquifer monitoring data acquired in the same period 1992 2014 the small oscillations of the groundwater level and the almost stable streambed spring discharge allows the presumption of an additional aquifer recharge source the confined carbonate aquifer locally mixes with the above volcanic aquifer providing an externally stable recharge that reduces the effects of the local rainfall variability the combined approach of the groundwater budget results and long term aquifer monitoring spring discharge and or hydraulic head oscillation provides information about significant external groundwater exchanges even if unidentified by field measurements and supports the stakeholders in groundwater resource management keywords groundwater budget volcanic aquifer carbonate aquifer effective infiltration groundwater exchanges long term aquifer monitoring 1 introduction the increasing imbalance between the water supply and water demand in many parts of europe potentially exacerbated by changes in the climate during the past few decades di matteo et al 2010 water availability and water scarcity have progressively emerged as key issues in national and eu water policy water framework directive 2000 60 ec european commission 2015 and strategy european commission 2007 european commission 2012 european commission 2013 many studies approach the problem of correct exploitation through quantification of the safe yield for an aquifer safe yield is commonly defined as the attainment and maintenance of a long term balance between the amount of groundwater annually withdrawn and the annual amount of recharge hahn et al 1997 sophocleous 2000 it follows that the available groundwater depends on how changes in recharge and discharge affect the surrounding environment alley and leake 2004 it is possible to derive balance equations to relate explicitly the sustainable pumping rate to the natural groundwater recharge zhou 2009 and references therein where the safe yield of an aquifer is often calculated as a percentage of the natural recharge most water management authorities pay higher attention to the results of the groundwater budget in fact building groundwater balances helps to combine and structure the key components of the natural hydrological cycle without human pressures and the relevant inputs and outputs due to human interventions e g abstractions and returns into a coherent framework the different components of the groundwater balance convey information on the state of the inputs and outputs at reference times and their changes according to different reference periods these components are dynamic subject to trends and influenced by natural variation in the amount and timing of precipitation and temperature and anthropogenic drivers e g water abstraction flow regulation and land use change groundwater balances are differently applied today in the european catchment depending mostly on the national laws in italy water balances are developed according to the guidelines for the preparation of the basin water balance reported in the ministry of environment protection decree of 28th july 2004 and following an update in legislative decree 152 2006 decreases in recharge or overexploitation could cause progressive depletion of the groundwater resource and a negative budget discrepancy calderhead et al 2012 maréchal et al 2006 zhou 2009 over the long term the comparison between the amount of recharge and the total outflows natural outflows and withdrawals can provide information about the degree of groundwater resource exploitation capelli et al 2005 generally the overexploitation total outflows natural recharge results in groundwater depletion associated with detrimental effects such as well yield reduction pumping cost increases spring discharge decreases and groundwater level decline custodio et al 2016a b foster et al 2004 konikow 2015 however the groundwater budget could not be calculated without the complete knowledge of the boundary condition of a hydrogeological basin if the considered system is bounded by clear groundwater divides no flux boundaries their positions define the basis of any water management decisions which entail quantifying inflows and outflows genereux et al 2005 the groundwater exchanges with external basins can occur especially where the aquifer boundaries are not clearly defined and thus it becomes more difficult to properly assess the groundwater inflows and outflows filippini et al 2015 in some cases groundwater exchanges are negligible compared to the direct recharge conversely in other cases they could be consistent and generate effects on water quality or significant discrepancies in the groundwater budget mastrorillo and petitta 2014 moreover in some thick and fractured aquifers contributions of vertical flow from depth could be significant in terms of available resources in these cases the exploitation could have low or negligible impacts and groundwater levels and spring flow rates might remain unchanged due to the hydraulic connection with neighboring aquifers these hidden and scarcely quantifiable inflows could constitute a major portion of the available groundwater resource carrillo rivera 2000 in conclusion the balance equation depends on three main components the natural recharge effective infiltration the anthropogenic induced activities and the relationship of the studied system with neighboring basins external groundwater inflow and outflow in the presence of significant external groundwater exchanges not assumed in the conceptual model the results of only the groundwater budget calculation could not be reliable precisely because of the high uncertainty of the non measurable groundwater exchanges the combined results of the groundwater budget and the aquifer monitoring spring discharge or hydraulic head measurements over a long time could provide more information about the aquifer conditions and could support the definition of a new hydrogeological conceptual model these circumstances seem to be present in the riardo plain aquifer which is a strategic drinking resource for more than 100 000 people water storage for 60 km2 of irrigated land and the source of a mineral water bottling plant viaroli et al 2016c in this area located in southern italy water supply operators have expressed concerns about the potential impact of the strong and prolonged exploitation for conjunctive purposes on the future availability of groundwater resources autorità di bacino dei fiumi liri garigliano e volturno 2008 the present study aims to contribute to improving the knowledge of the recharge processes of the riardo plain aquifer in order to verify the actual aquifer conditions and continue its exploitation without risking abrupt groundwater depletion for this purpose a simplified approach was used to evaluate the average annual and monthly groundwater budgets over twenty three years 1992 2014 and to calculate the monthly mean distribution of the effective infiltration the yearly mean groundwater withdrawals were also evaluated the obtained results were compared with both the groundwater levels outflow variations and the precipitation variability measured in the same monitoring interval a new simplified hydrogeological conceptual model of the riardo plain aquifer was also proposed to better define the hypothetical groundwater recharge processes given the complexity of the hydrogeological setting of the study area the groundwater recharge model suggested was presented in its most simplified form and will inevitably have to be deepened by further studies nevertheless the first results achieved are already enough for supporting stakeholder decisions and directing future investigations the proposed case study highlights the groundwater budget calculation of the aquifer affected by the hydraulic connection between neighboring aquifers such as the riardo plain aquifer and is useful for the preliminary identification of the groundwater exchanges which are often very complicated to quantify in fact the underestimation or the overestimation of the external exchanges could significantly affect groundwater withdrawal management thus increasing the socioeconomic costs and the risk of overexploitation according to the results of this study a combined approach with the groundwater budget calculation and long term aquifer monitoring spring discharge and or groundwater level is recommended in order to reduce this uncertainty and to better evaluate the sustainability of the withdrawals for wise water management in this approach the aquifer recharge and exploitation are quantified by the groundwater budget calculation whereas the aquifer conservation status is defined by the long term monitoring this coupled control allows the identification of potential anomalies related to not otherwise recognizable groundwater inflows or outflows 2 geological and hydrogeological framework the concerned area is located in the northern campania region southern italy and corresponds to the eastern slope of the roccamonfina volcano and the riardo plain an intermountain basin formed during the apennine chain orogenesis the carbonate southern apennines are mainly made up of the lias cretaceous shelf limestone succession with a thickness of approximately 1500 m d argenio and pescatore 1962 from the messinian to early lower pliocene the sedimentary succession was affected by a compressive tectonic stage orogenesis of the apennine chain especially during the upper tortonian when the study area corresponded to the foredeep basin and sin orogenic flysch deposition occurred selli 1957 the widespread miocene flysch units cover the older mesozoic limestone successions and are the stratigraphic basement of the roccamonfina volcano capuano et al 1992 saroli et al 2017 subsequently an extensional tectonic stage lower pliocene upper pleistocene produced a horst and graben structure which extended in the nw se direction and is dislocated in the ne sw direction chiappini et al 1998 the dislocation of the sedimentary basement formed the tectonic basin of the riardo plain subsequently filled by volcanic units pleistocene holocene volcanoclastic deposits and actual alluvial units the roccamonfina volcano activity started approximately 550 ka triggered by the extensional tectonic activity and ended approximately 150 ka surrounding carbonate and marls horsts of the cretaceous age form the lateral margins of the basin in which the roccamonfina has developed rouchon et al 2008 the volcanic activity is subdivided into three main epochs de rita et al 1997 the first epoch is mainly characterized by effusive activity with the emission of sub saturated lava flows and by the growing of the stratovolcano and several small volcanic centers the second activity epoch started approximately 350 ka rouchon et al 2008 is characterized by a succession of highly explosive eruptions and the emplacement of pyroclastic units giannetti and de casa 2000 luhr and giannetti 1987 during the third phase minor phreatomagmatic activity and latitic lava domes were emplaced de rita and giordano 1996 giannetti 1964 1996 borehole data in the riardo plain highlight the local absence of the flysch deposits in the eastern peripheral sector of the roccamonfina volcano and the direct deposition of the volcanic units over the carbonate basement the thickness of the volcanic deposits in the riardo plain is extremely variable according to the pre volcanic morphology and ranges from a few meters near the carbonate ridges to more than 250 m detected in a borehole in the ferrarelle s p a bottling plant moving toward the volcano edifice geophysical data capuano et al 1992 suggested an increase in the deepening of the sedimentary basement in correspondence with the roccamonfina volcano edifice where several hundred meters of lava deposits emplaced during the first phase of the volcanic activity are expected the hydrostructure of the roccamonfina volcano hosts a regional centrifugal aquifer which constitutes an open hydrogeological unit towards the surrounding plains the roccamonfina volcano s7 in fig 1 recharge area approximately 350 km2 feeds several springs up to a total discharge of 2 1 m3 s including the savone linear spring of approximately 1 2 m3 s and groundwater leakage is estimated to be approximately 2 m3 s boni et al 1986 the volcanic hydrostructure is surrounded by five carbonate hydrogeological units u1 u2 u3 s6 and the southern portion of the g2 units each carbonate hydrostructure mainly discharges towards productive springs located at its edge with rates higher than 1 m3 s boni et al 1986 fig 1 recent hydrogeological studies on the roccamonfina volcano viaroli et al 2016b also suggest the distinction between the groundwater circulation in the caldera and the basal volcanic aquifer in addition along the eastern slope of the roccamonfina volcano some low productive aquifers perched on a shallow aquitard low permeability pyroclastic deposits were identified viaroli et al 2016a these aquifers usually feed a few small seasonal springs the volcanic aquifer is recharged from the upper portion of the volcano edifice and groundwater moves radially toward the riardo plain where it feeds the savone linear spring at an elevation between 90 and 40 m a s l viaroli et al 2016c in the riardo plain the volcanic aquifer overlaps a deeper fractured carbonate aquifer characterized by high secondary porosity the carbonate aquifer is mainly recharged by the eastern portion of the volcano edifice capelli et al 1999 cuoco et al 2010 the two aquifers can be clearly distinguished in the eastern sector of the plain where the flysch unit covers the carbonate substratum and plays the role of an aquiclude consequently carbonate and volcanic aquifers show different hydraulic heads and opposite flow directions viaroli et al 2016c in contrast hydraulic connections were recognized near the town of riardo where the intersection of different fault systems and the absence of the flysch units allow the uprising of deep fluids cuoco et al 2010 in this sector the carbonate and volcanic hydraulic head have the same elevation between 140 and 60 m a s l and the mixing with co2 supersaturated fluids forms the local mineral water type the geochemical composition of the volcanic aquifer confirms that the mineralization process depends only on the water volcanic rock interaction the deeper carbonate aquifer shows both carbonate and volcanic features i e alkali metals silica fe and as as a consequence of the mineralization processes occurring during groundwater evolution during the groundwater transfer from the recharge area roccamonfina volcano to the riardo plain the groundwater interacts not only with volcanic units but also with carbonate rocks cuoco et al 2010 wherever the elevation of the sedimentary basement reached the volcanic groundwater flow path elevation fig 2 under these conditions the two aquifers carbonate and volcanic could then be considered a single large basal groundwater circulation with chemistry variations according to the depth called the basal aquifer from the climatic point of view the study area is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate with dry and warm summers from june to august and a wet period that occurs during autumn winter and spring from september to april ducci and tranfaglia 2008 fiorillo 2009 the mean monthly rainfall reaches a maximum during november approximately 160 mm and a minimum in july and august approximately 30 mm the mean annual rainfall measured in the northern campania region is approximately 1000 mm with a coefficient of variation of approximately 0 3 the air temperature has a similar trend in all meteorological stations with some differences related to the ground elevation the minimum temperatures were measured in january and february approximately 7 c with a progressive increasing up to july and august approximately 23 5 c dataset ferrarelle s p a 2015 dataset regione campania 2015a b 2 1 study area the study area corresponds to the eastern slope of the roccamonfina volcano and the western sector of the riardo plain where hydraulic connections were recognized between the volcanic and the carbonate portion of the basal aquifer the groundwater balance reference area has an extension of approximately 100 km2 fig 3 and most of the boundaries were defined as the groundwater divides of the volcanic aquifer the southeastern boundary corresponds to the outcrop of the m coricuzzo carbonate relief which does not seem to be in connection with the aquifer in the plain viaroli et al 2016c in this area the water table of the basal aquifer shows depths ranging from at least 200 meters on the volcano edifice to 0 m where the savone streambed spring outflow in the western sector of the riardo plain seven hydrogeological complexes were defined modified from allocca et al 2007 capelli et al 1999 mazza et al 2013 viaroli et al 2016a of which only five outcrop in the reference area alluvia complex this complex is composed of reworked sediments deposited at the base of slopes or in the fluvial valley these deposits could host aquifers due to the high primary porosity dolomite complex no outcropping in the reference area this complex corresponds to the dolomite unit at the bottom of the sedimentary sequence the dolomite complex is characterized by average secondary porosity therefore it plays the role of aquitard for the carbonate aquifer limestone complex this complex corresponds to the limestone units and is characterized by high secondary porosity according to fractioning and karst processes this complex hosts the carbonate aquifer flysch complex no outcropping in the reference area this complex is composed of sands and clays deposited in the foredeep basin this complex is characterized by overall low hydraulic conductivity and it plays the role of aquiclude between the volcanic and carbonate aquifers lava complex this complex corresponds to all lava and lava dome units mainly characterized by high hydraulic conductivity due to cooling fractures these units could also serve as a local aquiclude where they appear nearly unfractured fine grained pyroclastic complex this complex is composed of lithified pyroclastic deposits and ashy matrix pyroclastic deposits due to its low hydraulic conductivity this complex is a local aquitard separating aquifer layers hosted in the permeable volcanic complex coarse grained pyroclastic complex this complex includes all other pyroclastic deposits characterized by little higher porosity than the other pyroclastic units this complex hosts the volcanic aquifer due to average primary porosity the groundwater budget parameters were calculated for the basal aquifer and recharged by direct rainfall infiltration of the roccamonfina volcano slope according to the riardo plain hydrogeological framework described above this aquifer has proven to be rather productive with transmissivity values ranging from 10e 3 volcanic portion of the basal aquifer to 10e 2 carbonate circulation unpublished aquifer pumping tests by ferrarelle s p a and it is exploited intensively for agricultural and drinking water uses most of the riardo plain approximately 60 of the study area is used for agricultural purposes especially for irrigated plantations such as fruit trees more than 40 of the total area and cereal crops approximately 8 the remaining area is covered by deciduous trees more than 30 in the upper section of the roccamonfina volcano or by scattered small urbanized areas approximately 4 european environment agency 2000 the most substantial well fields are located near teano town teano s giulianeta with a constant pumping rate of 240 l s

terms to calculate the groundwater budget of the riardo plain hydrogeological system the prior spatial reference system and the temporal interval were both fixed the boundaries of the riardo plain hydrogeological system were based on the bibliographic data described in the previous paragraphs the recharge area limited by the groundwater divides identified on the potentiometric map by viaroli et al 2016c covers approximately 100 km2 the time interval for which the groundwater budget was calculated corresponds to 23 years from 1992 to 2014 given the large size of the area and the length of the observation period inevitably the inflow and outflow terms of the budget lack spatial and temporal homogeneity the longest available time series were preferred even if not always continuous in order to omit the quantification of the aquifer storage variations which can be neglected if compared to the other budget terms over such a long period custodio and llamas 2005 the next paragraphs of this chapter explain how the problems about heterogeneous data were overcome on a case by case basis the groundwater budget terms were defined both at the mean monthly and at mean yearly scales according to the available data and distinguished based on the inflow and outflow terms the unique inflow term corresponds to the effective infiltration calculated from thermo pluviometric data it was verified that lateral inflows in the aquifers from rivers are negligible in fact according to previous hydrogeological survey results università degli studi roma tre 1999 università degli studi roma tre 2014 viaroli et al 2016b the savone river unique perennial river in the reference area is not in hydraulic connection with the aquifer along the volcano slope where the low permeability fine grained pyroclastic complex outcrops fig 3 in contrast in the riardo plain several streambed springs are present in correspondence with the outcrops of the aquifer complex coarse grained pyroclastic complex no losing portions of the savone river were detected in the field since most of the water pumped in the basin is used for irrigation part of it can return to the aquifer by direct infiltration in this work the agricultural return flow was considered not relevant according to land use information approximately 70 of the irrigated areas corresponds to fruit trees for which no return flow was assumed since these crops use drip irrigation techniques that eliminate irrigation losses maréchal et al 2006 the absence of paddy fields and irrigation channels allows this possible additional inflow term to be neglected the outflow terms consist of natural outflows discharge of savone streambed springs and artificial outflows groundwater withdrawals the main difficulties were found in the assessment of these terms because of both the lack of continuous monitoring of the savone river baseflow and the absence of an official database about withdrawals for agricultural purposes this set of problems is also discussed in the next paragraphs on a case by case basis in conclusion the classical groundwater budget equation input output δs in this work is stated as follows e i n d w t δ s where ei effective infiltration is the parameter quantifying the amount of rainfall that is involved in the aquifer recharge nd natural discharge corresponds to the total discharge of the springs fed by the aquifer wt artificial discharge corresponds to the sum of the agricultural industrial and drinking withdrawals and δs is the aquifer storage variation neglected in this work according to the long time interval of the budget calculation 3 1 1 inflow the groundwater budget inflow terms were computed from daily thermo pluviometric data of local weather stations placed in the northern campania region the data acquired from several databases dataset ferrarelle s p a 2015 dataset regione campania 2015a b have a time range of 15 years from 2000 to 2014 except for the riardo ferrarelle and roccamonfina weather stations whose locations are shown in fig 3 which have a dataset recorded in the 1992 2014 interval the monthly thermo pluviometric dataset resulting from the aggregation of the daily data at a monthly scale presents gaps in each weather station due to different periods of activity or to technical malfunctions of the instruments the missing data were reconstructed according to the correlation of the contemporaneous data of nearby stations only the correlations with a r2 0 85 were taken into account to fill the gaps finally cumulate monthly rainfall and mean monthly temperature were calculated for all weather stations the mean monthly actual evapotranspiration the water surplus and the water deficit were calculated using thornthwaite s method thornthwaite and mather 1957 for each weather station the punctual results of the water surplus were then geostatistically interpolated considering the existing correlation of the weather variables with the ground elevation cokriging was applied using gis to spatialize the data the monthly effective infiltration as the portion of the water surplus that can infiltrate was calculated multiplying the monthly distributed water surplus with the coefficients of potential infiltration weighted with the slope c i p s the infiltration potential coefficients c i p celico 1988 evaluate the range of the amount in percent of the water surplus which could infiltrate according to the physical properties of the outcropping soils or rocks e g porosity and permeability c i p values were associated with the outcropping volcanic and sedimentary complexes described table 1 according to previous studies autorità di bacino dei fiumi liri garigliano e volturno 2008 celico 1988 to include the effect of the morphology on infiltration the raster map of c i p distribution was multiplied by the slope map s in and calculated from the digital elevation model map with 50 meters of resolution in gis the raster maps were then combined via map algebraic operations the c i p s were calculated cell by cell according to the following relationship c i p s c i p 1 s 100 the maps of the monthly distribution of the effective infiltration were realized taking in account the distribution of the c i p s and the distributed monthly water surplus the elaborations were clipped according the boundaries of the recharge area 3 1 2 outflows in the groundwater budget calculation the recharge was compared with the main groundwater outflows the natural discharge of savone linear springs and the groundwater withdrawals for different purposes it is assumed that the baseflow rate of the savone river measured at the closing section during dry periods corresponds with the total groundwater natural outflows data regarding river discharge were collected during specific hydrogeological surveys autorità di bacino dei fiumi liri garigliano e volturno 2008 università degli studi roma tre 1999 università degli studi roma tre 2014 carried out at least one week after the last significant rainfall event to exclude runoff from the assessment of the baseflow from available data it was possible to assess the groundwater natural outflow for each hydrogeological survey withdrawal data were collected from several databases and separately elaborated according to the different purposes data about drinking water withdrawals were collected from autorità di bacino dei fiumi liri garigliano e volturno 2008 where information supplied from the technical bureau of the municipalities and from the aqueduct district database ato 2 napoli volturno regione campania 2003 is reported withdrawals for industrial purposes were calculated from the information of the industries and services census dataset istat 2011 at the municipal scale the daily groundwater requirement for each employee was assessed according to the ateco classification dataset istat 2007 of all productive activities placed in the study area the withdrawals of the mineral water bottling activity were included in this category information about withdrawals for agricultural purposes are not present in any specific database the previous hydrogeological studies autorità di bacino dei fiumi liri garigliano e volturno 2008 capelli et al 1999 assumed that the agricultural withdrawals were at least the difference between the water requirement for the plantations and the available water the authors calculated the plantation water requirements on the different plant species distributed according to the land use information european environment agency 2000 dataset istat 1994 nino and fais 2001 in the present study groundwater withdrawal for irrigation purposes was set equal to the mean monthly water deficit calculated using thornthwaithe s method in agricultural areas and equal to zero elsewhere the agricultural withdrawals were thus calculated from water requirements of the plantation without distinguishing among the different species a small agricultural portion of the study area is irrigated through the sannio alifano consortium which takes water from outside the studied area as since 2011 this external water contribution is taken into account in the budget calculation according to the information supplied by the consortium 3 2 aquifer monitoring the hydrogeological budget results were compared to the groundwater levels trend measured almost every 15 days since the 90s dataset ferrarelle s p a 2016 in order to evaluate any possible effect of groundwater exploitation during the considered time interval among the several monitored points two significant wells pzc and pzv placed in the ferrarelle mineral water bottling plant fig 3 were chosen the hydraulic head level measured in the selected wells are characterized by the same oscillations in magnitude and in time measured in the other wells in addition these two wells provide the longest and most complete time series pzv is an approximately 60 m deep monitoring well tapping the volcanic portion of the basal aquifer pzc is an approximately 250 m deep monitoring well tapping the carbonate portion of the basal aquifer 3 3 climatic trend analysis the standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 1995 is a powerful flexible index to analyze the occurrence and the magnitude of drought periods world meteorological organization 2012 the spi was designed to quantify the precipitation deficit for multiple timescales according to the different water resource dynamics the spi is defined for each timescale as follows spi x i x σ x where xi is the monthly rainfall amount x is the arithmetic mean of rainfall and σ x is the standard deviation calculated from the whole monthly time series positive spi values indicate a greater than median precipitation wetter periods and negative values indicate less than median precipitation drier periods mckee et al 1993 a drought event occurs any time the spi is continuously negative and reaches an intensity of at least 1 the event ends when the spi becomes positive the spi can be calculated from 1 month up to 72 months but statistically 1 24 months is the best practical range of application guttman 1998 1999 few studies have explored the correlation between the groundwater level variations mendicino et al 2008 bloomfield and marchant 2013 bloomfield et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 or the spring discharge variations fiorillo and guadagno 2010 2012 to spi the authors suggested different statistical elaborations to standardize the aquifer oscillations such as the groundwater resource index mendicino et al 2008 standardized groundwater level index bloomfield and marchant 2013 and standardized streamflow index vicente serrano et al 2012 the results of all methods applied at the catchment scale over multiple long term monitoring datasets agree with the importance of having a high density of hydrological and climatic data to understand the effects of the precipitation variability according to the sub basin hydrogeological properties in this study the non uniform spatial distribution and the scarcity of long term hydrological monitoring datasets do not allow detailed statistical elaborations over the entire catchment therefore the spi was used to highlight the precipitation variability over the groundwater budget calculation period also focusing on the presence of drought periods to compare with the aquifer oscillations the climatic elaboration was realized by taking into account the precipitation time series of the riardo ferrarelle meteorological station which guarantees rainfall data from 1980 without significant interruptions dataset ferrarelle s p a 2015 the available dataset was transformed into a normalized distribution and then standardized i e mean spi equal to 0 the rainfall data were elaborated using a 12 month time scale spi12 since it better represents long term precipitation patterns and is better tied to groundwater resource dynamics fiorillo and guadagno 2010 world meteorological organization 2012 4 results 4 1 groundwater budget calculation the annual rainfall data measured in the eight weather stations in the northern campania region show a wide range from approximately 580 mm in 2000 to approximately 1600 mm measured in 2009 the mean monthly rainfall data calculated over the 2000 14 period shows a similar trend for the eight stations fig 4 with a decrease in monthly rainfall from january to august a quick increase during the autumn and maximum precipitation in november the mean temperature trend is common to all monitored weather stations characterized by cold winters and warm summers relative differences in the temperature are only related to the station elevation according to a linear relationship r2 0 85 in fig 4 the monthly mean water surplus ws is also represented calculated according to ws p ev where p is the mean monthly rainfall and ev corresponds to the monthly actual evapotranspiration calculated using thornthwaite s method the groundwater recharge is possible only when ws is not zero in all weather stations the recharge period was identified between november and april with one exception starting in december from may to october the actual evapotranspiration exceeds the rainfall with a consequent progressive depletion of the initial amount of soil water during july and august the available soil water turns to zero and the higher evapotranspiration demand causes a water deficit the water deficit and the available water in the soil are restored by the autumnal precipitation at the grazzanise weather station the ws was identified only from december to april due to a lower amount of autumnal rainfall the geostatistical interpolation of the monthly water surplus and water deficit values calculated for each weather station allowed the extension of the values to the whole recharge area the results of the cokriging between the eight weather stations in the 2000 14 period were compared to the results of the same procedure applied only to the roccamonfina and riardo ferrarelle meteorological stations which began taking measurements in 1992 the comparison highlighted only minor differences and the usual overestimation of the water surplus approximately 3 in the elaboration using only two stations concerning the reliability of the elaboration the monthly ws and water deficit were calculated using the roccamonfina and riardo ferrarelle datasets over a twenty three year 1992 2014 interval the results are reported in table 2 the spatial distribution of the c i p s fig 5 allowed the identification of the areas where the effective infiltration prevails over the surface runoff these areas correspond to the eastern portion of the study area where the alluvial deposits of the riardo plain outcrop and the zones where lava and limestone outcrop over the roccamonfina volcano flank the c i p s values range from 93 to 21 with a mean value of approximately 55 the spatial distribution of the mean monthly effective infiltration fig 6 in the study area was calculated relating the c i p s raster with the raster distribution of the monthly mean water surplus the summary of the mean monthly values of the recharge parameters is reported in table 3 over the recharge area approximately 100 km2 wide the mean annual effective infiltration 233 mm y guarantees a renewable groundwater resource of 740 l s per year the mean annual effective infiltration calculated over the study area corresponds to approximately 25 of the mean annual precipitation similar to the results of regional hydrogeological studies over the other perithyrrenic quaternary volcanic domains baiocchi et al 2008 boni et al 1986 capelli et al 2005 the groundwater outflows from the hydrogeological system could be divided into natural discharges of the aquifer and anthropogenic withdrawals the natural outflow is assumed to be represented by the savone linear spring discharge at elevations between 120 and 40 m a s l fig 3 the baseflow of the savone is approximately 470 l s with minimum discharges measured in july 315 l s in 1998 200 l s in 2002 and 330 l s in 2013 the withdrawals can be distinguished and calculated according to the different uses the quantification of the agricultural withdrawals is one of the most important and complicated terms of the budget to be quantified tsanis and apostolaki 2009 venezian scarascia et al 2006 additional difficulties in agricultural withdrawal evaluation is the absence of an irrigation consortium which could provide local and reliable information on the water distribution on the entire study area and the absence of surface water resources including artificial accumulation reservoirs which correspond to the greatest source of water for irrigation todorovic et al 2007 nevertheless it is important to underline that the knowledge about groundwater resources is far from accurate due to frequent non authorized water abstraction for irrigation especially in the southern regions todorovic et al 2007 this study attempted to compare the monthly water surplus and the water deficit in the 1992 2014 period fig 7 the groundwater extraction required for the plantations life was preliminarily and conservatively evaluated equal to the water deficit the presence of a water deficit was detected in july and august months in which evapotranspiration exceeds the rainfall amount but with no more water apparent in the soil thus it seems reasonable to assume that irrigation is necessarily performed in order to avoid plant desiccation the agricultural withdrawals were calculated according to the monthly water deficit distributed over the 60 km2 irrigated areas approximately 60 of the study area fig 3 the estimated groundwater withdrawals for agricultural purposes are summarized in table 4 this outflow represents only a rough estimate since it is based on the local climatic conditions and not on the actual pumping rates of private wells these values fluctuate from 655 l s in 2003 the driest year of the considered period to 219 l s in 1995 with an average value of approximately 420 l s approximately 40 l s shall be subtracted in the 2011 14 interval to take into account the irrigation water from the external area provided by the bonifica sannio alifano consortium in conclusion a net agricultural withdrawal of approximately 395 l s was assumed a limited number of industrial activities are located in the study area the calculated industrial withdrawals is approximately 60 l s the mean value of the mineral water bottling activity was included in this withdrawal category reaching a mean withdrawal of approximately 50 l s during the study period most of the drinking wells that exploit the study aquifer fed the local population approximately 30 000 people with a rate of few liters per second table 5 six highly productive wells with a total constant pumping rate of 240 l s located near the town of teano teano s giulianeta are connected to the northern campanian aqueduct which feeds three cities external to the studied area the teano s giulianeta well field has been active since 1992 with a constant withdrawal rate during the study period the potential number of people fed by the riardo plain hydrogeological system reaches 100 000 units corresponding to a calculated withdrawal for human consumption of approximately 300 l s in table 6 all parameters of the groundwater budget calculation are summarized the estimation of the budget terms highlights a groundwater deficit of approximately 485 l s the calculated deficit is very high and surely wider than the calculation uncertainties 4 2 analysis of the precipitation trend the computed spi values are reported in fig 8 the drought and wet periods are defined according to the classification system proposed by mckee et al 1993 the first portion 1980 85 of the precipitation is characterized by an alternate moderately wet 1 spi12 1 49 and moderately dry periods 1 49 spi12 1 during the following 13 years significant wet periods are not detected only a moderately dry period between 1988 93 is evident the time interval period of the groundwater budget calculation is a characterized variable pattern an initial extremely dry period spi12 2 following a near normal moderately dry period 0 99 spi12 0 99 starting from 2008 there is a significant change in the precipitation regime with the presence of extremely wet spi12 2 and very wet 1 5 spi12 1 99 periods it is important to emphasize that significant wet periods are missing from 1985 to 2008 23 years the precipitation trend calculated in the riardo plain is similar to the results of other climatic studies realized in the same region the extremely dry period detected in the first 00 is the strictest drought period in magnitude and duration starting from 1930 fiorillo and guadagno 2010 5 discussion during the study period 1992 2014 the hydrogeological system in question provided a mean discharge of approximately 1200 l s calculated as the sum of natural and artificial outflows in the same period a mean effective infiltration of approximately 740 l s was calculated the results highlight a significant groundwater deficit 485 l s which is around 40 of the total discharge in an intensively exploited hydrogeological system for conjunctive purposes such a groundwater deficit would be an indicator of overexploitation of the aquifer on the assumption that the limits of the riardo plain hydrogeological system are a lateral no flux boundary corresponding to groundwater divides identified on the potentiometric map this overall scenario should be reflected in the unavoidable aquifer depletion as was observed in the last decades in other volcanic aquifers of central italy capelli et al 2005 mazza and mastrorillo 2013 mazza et al 2014 2015 the case study of 23 years of monitoring of groundwater levels of the basal aquifer fig 9 showed annual oscillations according to the seasonal variability of the recharge but not the expected decrease in the water table elevation indeed fig 9 does not note any aquifer depletion despite the outflows being much higher than the inflows in addition the near constancy of the savone baseflow confirms the absence of a significant groundwater deficit the minimum baseflow values measured at the beginning july 1998 315 l s and at the end july 2013 330 l s of the observation period are very similar furthermore the qualitative comparison of the available minimum discharge rates of the savone baseflow with the groundwater levels seems to depict a direct relationship fig 9 finally although the total aquifer outflows natural plus artificial are greater than the calculated recharge more than twenty years later they still have not triggered depletion of the aquifer then the presence of an additional lateral recharge from external hydrostructures can be supposed according to the hydrogeological setting of the study area nevertheless the budget results allow the formulation of a first estimation of the external groundwater inflow that should be comparable at least to the budget discrepancy i e approximately 485 l s this result means that the aquifer would present a combined recharge deriving from the direct zenithal infiltration for approximately 60 and from external inflows for approximately 40 the effects of the direct infiltration are evidenced by the relationship between the spi12 calculated on the precipitation data of riardo ferrarelle meteorological station and the groundwater level monitoring fig 10 it is worth noting the response of the aquifer system to the precipitation regime starting from 1985 near normal or moderately dry periods were detected an extremely dry period was detected from 1998 to 2002 the final period 2008 14 was characterized by a quick increase in the precipitation amount defining extremely wet and very wet periods the groundwater level trend shows annual oscillation according to the cyclic annual recharge and a progressive decrease until 2008 when the dry periods are followed by the first extremely wet period despite the significant changes in the precipitation the groundwater level variations in the monitoring period were quite moderate in fact the volcanic portion of the basal aquifer with a mean thickness of approximately 150 meters presents a maximum groundwater level variation of approximately 4 meters which corresponds to less than the 3 of the aquifer thickness the same consideration could not be made for the carbonate sector of the basal aquifer because information regarding the total thickness of the limestone was not available a thickness of approximately 80 meters of the saturated limestone was detected by borehole data giordano et al 1995 viaroli et al 2016c this very conservative information suggests a maximum variation of the aquifer thickness below 5 these groundwater level oscillations result in lower than other overexploited porous or volcanic aquifers in southern europe capelli et al 2005 custodio et al 2016a d alessandro et al 2011 kazakis 2014 mazza et al 2014 in which tens of meters of drawdown were observed this situation could suggest the presence of a continuous external contribution from neighboring hydrogeological systems that have good storage and self regulation capabilities these hydrodynamic attitudes are necessary to ensure a continuous and constant additional recharge capable of smoothing the large seasonal and annual changes in direct zenithal infiltration the results obtained to date allowed the proposal of a new simplified conceptual model of the groundwater recharge of the riardo plain basal aquifer fig 11 the structural setting of the sedimentary basement is characterized by a horst and graben structure due to the extensional tectonic activity which dislocated the carbonate blocks most of the water infiltrated into the carbonate relief drains toward the main springs placed outside the study system the remaining part of the water may supply the confined circulation in the deep fractured carbonate blocks beneath the considered basal aquifer according to the hydrogeological setting the two aquifers can be clearly distinguished in the eastern sector of the plain where the flysch unit covers the carbonate substratum and plays the role of aquiclude the study area is located in the wester sector of the plain where the flysch complex is not always present and a single groundwater circulation basal aquifer recharged by roccamonfina volcano was identified viaroli et al 2016c this peculiar setting facilitates the inflow of underlying semiconfined carbonate groundwater towards the overlying basal aquifer where the difference in the hydraulic heads permits it therefore it is reasonable that the studied aquifer could receive the greatest increase in recharge from the underlying carbonate units in correspondence with the mineral spring area where the extensional fault systems and the absence of the intermediate aquiclude allows the uprising of deep fluids in correspondence with the concession area of the mineral water bottle plant cuoco et al 2010 at present it seems premature to assign an exact provenance to this external recharge nevertheless it is reasonable to invoke the role of the carbonate ridges surrounding the roccamonfina volcano and the riardo plain which host several productive aquifers feeding spring systems outside the study area allocca et al 2007 boni et al 1986 according to the literature data about the effective infiltration values of these carbonate hydrostructures ranging from 706 to 888 mm year indicate that the external recharge area needed to feed 485 l s seeming groundwater deficit should cover between 16 to 20 km2 such an extension is a small percentage of the total area of the carbonate hydrostructures surrounding the riardo plain more than 1000 km2 therefore the identification of the recharge area based only on the groundwater budget is unlikely the external water inflow amount is actually comparable with the uncertainties in the calculation of the carbonate hydrostructure budgets which involve several m3 s to prove the hypothesis suggested and to make the conceptual model more realistic further investigation of both the local hydrogeological setting and the groundwater flow path of carbonate hydrostructures surrounding the study area is needed for this purpose a close cooperation between structural geologists and hydrogeochemists is desirable 6 conclusions the results of the groundwater budget calculation can provide information about the sustainability of the anthropogenic activities on the groundwater resources combining the groundwater budget calculation with long term aquifer monitoring it was possible to provide preliminary indications about advice on the aquifer boundary conditions and information about the impact of the estimated withdrawals on the available groundwater resources in fact the groundwater budget calculation on the riardo plain aquifer highlights a significant groundwater deficit approximately 40 with no correspondence to any significant depletion of the groundwater resource as shown in the long term aquifer monitoring the length of the calculation period more than twenty years 1992 2014 reasonably allows the exclusion of the effect of storage and transience of the study aquifer slight uncertainties regarding the appropriate identification of the recharge area are limited by the groundwater divides identified on the potentiometric map and the estimation of some budget parameters these drawbacks do not justify such a great negative budget discrepancy this anomaly could be explained by the presence of a hydraulic connection with a continuous external inflow from neighboring hydrostructures the aquifers that provide the additional recharge should have a large extension good storage and self regulation capabilities in order to be able to smooth the effects of the intense variability of the local zenithal infiltration the proposed hydrogeological model suggests an additional groundwater recharge similar to the calculated groundwater deficit this additional recharge comes from the underlying carbonate units which in turn were recharged by the carbonate reliefs surrounding the roccamonfina volcano and the riardo plain in correspondence with the mineralized spring area extensional fault systems and the absence of the intermediate aquiclude make possible the rise and the mixing of groundwater under pressure in conclusion a groundwater budget deficit is not necessarily an indication of aquifer depletion but is evidence of external groundwater inflow which has not been previously discussed these first achievements provided the basis for the following research steps the main objective of which would certainly be an identification of the exact provenance of the external recharge generally ascribed to the surrounding carbonate reliefs the complete understanding of the deep groundwater inflow requires other fundamental information inferable from stable isotope analysis δ2h δ18o more detailed groundwater budget calculation and structural measurements of the surrounding carbonate reliefs according to several authors baiocchi et al 2013 la vigna et al 2016 pola et al 2015 numerical modelling could be a powerful tool to test conceptual models in particular in the study area

7543,fine sediment plays crucial and multiple roles in the hydrological ecological and geomorphological functioning of river systems this study employs a two dimensional 2d numerical model to track the hydro morphological processes dominated by fine suspended sediment including the prediction of sediment concentration in flow bodies and erosion and deposition caused by sediment transport the model is governed by 2d full shallow water equations with which an advection diffusion equation for fine sediment is coupled bed erosion and sedimentation are updated by a bed deformation model based on local sediment entrainment and settling flux in flow bodies the model is initially validated with the three laboratory scale experimental events where suspended load plays a dominant role satisfactory simulation results confirm the model s capability in capturing hydro morphodynamic processes dominated by fine suspended sediment at laboratory scale applications to sedimentation in a stormwater pond are conducted to develop the process based understanding of fine sediment dynamics over a variety of flow conditions urban flows with 5 year 30 year and 100 year return period and the extreme flood event in 2012 are simulated the modelled results deliver a step change in understanding fine sediment dynamics in stormwater ponds the model is capable of quantitatively simulating and qualitatively assessing the performance of a stormwater pond in managing urban water quantity and quality keywords shallow water equations suspended load morphological changes stormwater pond 1 introduction in river systems fine grained sediment is a natural and essential component and plays a crucial role in the hydrological ecological and geomorphological functioning of the system it has been recognised that fine grained sediment management in urban rivers is environmentally significant birch et al 2006 sustainable sediment management requires a structure of supporting research on fine sediment dynamics and its interactions within hydrological catchments such as rivers floodplains reservoirs and sustainable urban drainage systems suds owens et al 2005 in general fine grained sediment has a controlling influence on the quality and quantity of receiving water in an urban catchment contaminants and pollutants including heavy metals and nutrients are generally absorbed by fine sediment which is then conveyed to the receiving waters saeedi et al 2004 jartun et al 2008 jones et al 2008 these urban pollutants attached to sediments have implications on both habitats of downstream receiving waters and human health wood and armitage 1997 owens et al 2005 crosa et al 2010 to mitigate these risks more sustainable features such as stormwater ponds are increasingly used in urban catchments as an option to manage fine suspended sediments ahilan et al 2016 allen et al 2017 by storing stormwater runoff trapping fine sediments and improving urban runoff quality the movement of sediment will be minimised by the interrupted flows in a storm water pond the low energy environment in the pond enables the considerable proportion of fine suspended load is trapped which provides water quality benefits to receiving water bodies however from a longer term viewpoint this will diminish the storage capacity of stormwater ponds thereby influencing their hydraulic performance and maintenance similarly fine grained sedimentation occurs in dam reservoirs where the release of deposited sediments often leads to cascading effects in downstream reaches through sediment transport and re deposition liu et al 2004 this has been considered to be a worldwide problem vörömarty et al 2003 additionally excessive suspended sediment inputs to rivers due to catchment erosion and in channel bank erosion can cause sedimentation in channels which may affect channel morphology stream habitats and navigation eekhout et al 2015 in view of the sediment effects natural processes have been widely used for river and flood management in recent years dadson et al 2017 in the aforementioned cases fine suspended sediment has a controlling influence on the quality and quantity of receiving waters in hydro systems through playing a variety of roles therefore there is a need to develop an improved understanding of how fine grained sediment is eroded transported and deposited by a variety of flow environments in recent years numerical models have been increasingly used to understand complex flows sediment transport and the corresponding morphological changes in rivers floodplains and suds in view of the multiple roles of fine grained sediment in receiving waters a robust fine sediment model is crucial to develop coupled models enabling the simulations and understanding of hydrological ecological and geomorphological conditions of catchments recently numerical models have been used to simulate dam break induced in channel evolution cao et al 2004 simpson and castelltort 2006 bohorquez and fernandez feria 2008 zech et al 2008 guan et al 2015a benkhaldoun et al 2012 li and duffy 2012 guan et al 2014 sediment routing in dam reservoirs liu et al 2004 guertault et al 2016 turbidity currents over erodible bed hu and cao 2009 hu et al 2012 janocko et al 2013 this provides feasible mathematical modelling approaches to quantify the evolution of sediment laden flows and corresponding geomorphological changes dominated by fine grained sediment this research presents a 2d numerical tool to track the erosion transport and deposition of fine grained sediment and particularly investigate fine sediment dynamics in stormwater ponds the model is a depth averaged 2d numerical model that includes a robust shallow water based hydrodynamic model a suspended load transport model and a bed evolution model it provides more reliable information than a 1d model whilst being more cost effective than a 3d model the model is capable of simulating full sediment transport process where non cohesive fine suspended load plays a dominant role including both sediment concentration in flow bodies and bed changes this is not only limited to a case with full suspended load transport but also to a case which may have a small portion of bedload whatever this should have a small rouse number lower than 2 5 during the main transport stage the model is firstly validated against three laboratory scale experiments prior to a real world application in a stormwater pond located in newcastle great park uk based on the simulation results this study aims to determine the erosion transport and deposition characteristics of fine sediment in a stormwater pond with various flow conditions and to develop a greater understanding of fine grained sediment dynamics in stormwater ponds 2 numerical model 2 1 hydrodynamic model shallow water based numerical models have been widely used for hydraulic modelling due to their robustness in capturing

cases were used to verify the model capability in simulating morphological changes dominant by fine suspended load which includes 1 sediment transport in a trench 2 partial dam breach flow over a mobile channel and 3 localised erosion and deposition in a pond with erodible bed in all three experimental cases it has been observed that suspended load is the main transport mode which ensures the applicability of the cases in the model verification here the model errors with the measured data were quantified using the brier skill score bss as 13 bss 1 1 n z i o z i m 2 1 n z i o z i t 0 o 2 where superscripts m and o refer to modelled and observed point data respectively and n is the total number of point data 3 1 1 sediment transport in a trench to verify the capability of the proposed model in predicting bed evolution under the conditions of unsteady flows a simulation was carried out to compare with experiments originally conducted at the delft hydraulics laboratory to investigate the movable bed evolution caused by steady open channel flow van rijn 1980 the trench is located in the middle of the 30 m long channel three tests with different side slopes of the trench 1 3 1 7 and 1 10 were performed in the experiments following van rijn 1980 the key information of the three tests is listed in table 1 the mean inflow velocity was 0 51 m s at the inlet and the water depth were kept constant as 0 39 m the erodible bed consists of fine sand with d 10 0 115 mm d 50 0 16 mm and d 90 0 2 mm the sand density and porosity was 2650 kg m3 and 0 4 respectively according to the experiment the settling velocity of sediment particles was 0 013 m s 25 a hindering settling velocity ω 0 0 015 m s is used manning s coefficient n is set to be 0 016 in addition to maintain the sediment equilibrium conditions in the upstream i e no scour or deposition occurring sand with the same composition was fed at a constant rate of 0 04 kg s m thereby the suspended load transport rate was estimated to be 0 03 0 006 kg s m and the bed load transport rate of about 0 01 kg s m the contribution of the suspended load transport to the total load transport was in the range of 60 to 90 for simulation the whole domain is discretised by 150 cells with δx 0 2 m to ensure steady flow the model is run for 900 s after 900 s sand is fed and bed evolution occurs van rijn 1984 suggested estimating the reference level by the following equation a min max k s 2 d 50 0 01 h 0 2 h based on this formulation a 0 01 m and a 0 02 m was used in the model to demonstrate the influence of the reference level fig 1 plots the simulated velocity and depth averaged measurement at the five measured sections it can be seen that the model produces the velocity reasonably well around the trench also the water surface has been simulated to be close to the real constant value 0 39 m regarding the predictin of changes in bed profiles fig 2 indicates that the simulated bed profiles with a 0 01 m and a 0 02 m show similar shape with only a slight difference with both reference levels the simulated bed has a high brier skill score which is over 0 9 when a 0 01 m the model gives a better results therefore the model is also verified in test 2 and test 1 with the reference level a 0 01 m as shown in fig 3 the general bed profiles at both 7 5 h and 15 h are produced with a good bss this implies the capability of the model in simulating bed changes due to sediment transport dominant by suspended load 3 1 2 partial dam breach flow over a mobile channel to verify and validate the performance of the suspended load model it was used to reproduce partial dam breach flow experiments over a mobile bed which were carried out at the hydraulics laboratory of tsinghua university china xia et al 2010 a thin dam was located 2 0 m downstream of a 18 5 m 1 6 m rectangular flume and a 0 2 m wide dam breach centred at y 0 8 m the region of 4 5 m after dam site was covered by fine non uniform coal ash with a median diameter of 0 135 mm and its natural and dry density were measured approximately as 2248 kg m3 and 720 kg m3 respectively the water depth was initially set to be 0 4 m in the reservoir and 0 12 m downstream of the dam in this experiment the bed levels at two cross sections cs1 x 2 5 m and cs2 x 3 5 m after 20 s were measured during the whole experiment only suspended load transport occurs due to the particles being so fine table 2 lists the key parameters used in the simulation for the simulation the domain is discretised by 370 80 cells and the time interval is δt 0 005 s the manning s coefficient n 0 02 s m1 3 the sediment porosity is set as 0 35 the suspended load model is run for 20 s fig 4 shows a comparison between the observed and modelled cross sectional profiles at 20 s it is shown that the trend of the predicted bed profiles is similar to that of the measured profiles erosion occurs in the middle of the cross sections the bed erosion quantity is less than the measurement at cs1 where the predicted bed is underestimated particularly in terms of the erosion width however a similar maximum scour depth and location are predicted here at cs2 the simulated and measured bed profiles are in good agreement with each other the simulated and measured scour depths are very close and the erosion areas agree very well with each other but the measured range of bed profile is about 20 cm wider than the simulated range for this reason it can be seen that the bss for cs2 is relatively smaller the bed deposition is underestimated by the model here this is possibly due to either the experimental errors or the neglected turbulence term which means the model may not be able to generate the rapid formation of horizontal circulating flow at the downstream of the dam fig 5 illustrates the contour plot of the simulated bed topography after 20 s severe erosion occurs at the outlet of the dam and the eroded suspended load is flushed to deposit downstream due to the decrease of bed shear stress 3 1 3 erosion and deposition in a pond with erodible bed the experiment was conducted to investigate the erosion process in a rectangular basin due to clear water inflow from a narrow channel by thuc 1991 in this test the initial setup involves an inlet rectangular channel of 2 0 m long and 0 2 m wide a rectangular movable basin with 5 0 m long and 4 0 m wide and a 1 0 m long and 1 2 m wide channel in the downstream therein the movable basin consists of fine sand with median diameter of 0 6 mm with a movable bed layer was 0 16 m thick for the initial hydraulic conditions initial water depth was specified as 0 15 m the inflow velocity at the inflow boundary was kept constant at 0 6 m s and the water depth at the outlet was a constant value of 0 15 m only basin area is erodible during the experiment period table 3 show the key parameters of the experimental case this experiment is simulated in this study because the sediment particle diameter is small 0 6 mm and the rouse number of the case is estimated to be in a range of 0 2 4 in the main movable area which means suspended load is the dominant transport mode this fits the capability of the present model the length of channel is discretised with a constant interval δx 0 1 m but in width direction the grid spacing around the centreline 0 6 m is set to be finer δy1 0 02 m than that in other parts δy2 0 05 m the computational mesh in the basin consists of 80 116 cells the time step for flow and sediment calculation is set the same at 0 009 s the manning s roughness coefficient n in the basin is given a value of 0 03 s m1 3 the model was run for 2 h of experiment time eq 4 is used to calculate the entrainment and deposition fluxes in this case fig 6 a shows the simulated bed change pattern around the inflow region at the centre part of the basin after 4 h and fig 6 b demonstrates the flow velocity field and bed shear stress it can be seen that the inflow pipe has the biggest bed shear stress due to the high flow velocity and the inflow pipe outfall area and the outlet area also have higher bed shear stress therefore it can be seen that significant erosion occurs at the outfall area due to the inflow of clear water then the eroded sediment moves downstream and deposits forming a hill since only basin area is erodible no bed changes are found at the outlet area fig 7 further shows the comparison of the measured and simulated bed changes along the longitudinal centreline at 1 h 2 h and 4 h all have a satisfying brier skill score bss overall the simulated morphological evolution tendency at 1 h and 2 h are in good agreement with the measured results however the maximum deposition heights are slightly under predicted with a 13 4 difference at 1 h and 30 6 at 2 h furthermore it can be seen that the model overestimates the erosion depth at the inlet of the basin there the simulated erosion is much more severe than the measured erosion this is most likely because secondary flow plays an important role here however these non hydrostatic flows are neglected in the current model 3 2 application in a stormwater pond stomwater ponds are characterised by urban runoff detention runoff quality improvement and sediment trapping the decrease in flow velocity and the low energy environment causes deposition of fine sediments delivered by urban flows as it enters the pond stormwater pond sedimentation leads to a decrease in pond storage capacity and triggers environmental and economic issues the validated model is applied to a case study of a stormwater pond in newcastle great park and based on the results improved understanding of fine sediment dynamics is developed 3 2 1 study site the study area is located in ouseburn catchment the black boundary in fig 8 a in newcaslte upon tyne in the uk the stormwater pond connects the upstream newly built urban development and the ouseburn river fig 8c shows the simulated domain which is an area of 230 m by 140 m it was observed that the pond is covered with dense vegetation which protects the local bed for simulations the flow discharge is input to the model via a pipe section as an upstream boundary the other boundary is set to be free open which means that the floodwater can freely flow out based on the local flow conditions 3 2 2 model scenarios three scenarios were considered non flood 5 year sewer design 30 year and flood 100 year fig 9 a also rainfall events in the extreme flow year 2012 with 15 min interval rainfall measurements at the jesmond dene gauging station ea 19356 were used to conduct an annual sediment simulation and the flow at the inlet for the identified rainfall events is quantified by using the physically based conceptual rainfall runoff model the revitalised flood hydrograph refh model fig 9b allen et al 2015 measured the continuous flow records from january to may 2015 at the pond s outfall the refh rainfall runoff model is calibrated with the observed flow data sets by varying the drainage length parameter dplbar in the model based on the field survey the fine sediment composes of three classes d10 5 µm fine silt d50 12 µm fine silt and d90 50 µm silt that were obtained from the manual sampling and equally distributed as an input in the upstream boundary the fine sediment concentration is estimated based on the regression relationships between flow turbidity and suspended sediment concentration from the analogue catchment ahilan et al 2016 in order to assess the relative impact of the pond on the hydrologic and morphologic responses during high flow events two digital elevation model dem data sets were incorporated in the model setup the current dem represents existing topography with pond condition and the dem corresponding to the year 2000 represents the predevelopment stage without pond scenario in the hydro morphodynamic model table 4 lists the key information about this case study 3 3 model validation with sampling data allen et al 2015 surveyed the cumulative sediment deposition at monthly intervals at six locations in the pond during the monitoring period which is used to validate the morphodynamic model in simulating sediment deposition in the pond flow events between 23 04 2015 and 26 05 2015 as shown in fig 10 were modelled because there are a number of high flow events over the period apart from low base flows fig 10 shows the simulated sediment deposition in the pond and the location of the six monitoring points it indicates that the main deposition area is located at the outfall area this is because the flow velocity sharply decreases after the water flows to the pond from upstream pipe this leads to bed shear stress be so small that sediment particles settle down to the bed resuspension during high flows causes slight sedimentation in the far area from the outfall table 5 shows the measured and simulated depths at the six monitoring points it is indicated that the model predicts the sedimentation in the stormwater pond generally well despite the fact that there are clear discrepancies at some points these differences are expected because of the uncertainty factors in reality the main uncertainty factors include 1 the stormwater pond is covered by a variety of soft vegetation which causes clear implication on flow dynamics and sediment transport however this is difficult to quantify and predict 2 the inflow discharge and sediment concentration are quantified based on a conceptual rainfall runoff model and regression relationship between flow and turbidity thus this brings about uncertainties in model inputs 3 sediment particles are very fine and the sedimentation depth is small the field monitoring quantifies sediment weights rather depths which might cause some errors to quantify its real depth despite of the discrepancies it can be seen that both simulated and measured shows a higher deposition near the outfall location and a smaller sedimentation at the far point from the outfall therefore considering the main objective of this study in developing better understanding of fine suspended load transport the model results are deemed to be adequate 3 4 fine grained sediment tracking during single events the validated model is used in the hydro morphological simulations during single events 5 year flow 30 year flow and 100 year flow fig 11 shows the water depths suspended load concentration and bed shear stress and velocity field during the flow peak for each scenario as well as the resultant sediment deposition in the stormwater pond after each event in the viewpoint of hydrodynamic effects it is clear that the pond has the capability to store the 5 year flow and the sediment particles in the flow bodies are mostly trapped in the stormwater pond fig 11b and gradually settle down in the stormwater pond because of the slow flow velocity and the low bed shear stress however during the 30 year and 100 year flow events fig 11f and j a considerable amount of water flows from the pond into the river which transports fine sediments downstream as shown in fig 11f and j although the waters in the pond still have relative higher suspended load sediment particles are flushed out to the river with the increasing inflow this leads to deposition not only inside the pond but also in the river downstream fig 11g and l table 6 quantifies the input sediments and the deposited sediments for the three scenarios it shows that the increasing of inflow magnitude results in a decrease in sediment trapping efficiency of the pond as expected before building the stormwater pond the urban flows were directly drained into the river the simulated results in fig 12 clearly shows that the direct drainage to the watercourse leads to much wider inundation and sedimentation during flooding in comparison with that with the pond in fig 12 consequently sediment particles are deposited in the inundated areas after flood recession as demonstrated in fig 12f and j even for the more frequent 5 year flow event the direct drainage causes considerable amount of sedimentation in the river channel if there is any the contaminants attached with sediment particles will potentially influence the water quality in the receiving water therefore the simulations imply that the stormwater pond has the benefits of retaining urban flows and trapping sediment particles generated from upstream urban catchment the model is capable of quantitatively simulating and qualitatively assessing the performance of a stormwater pond in managing urban floods 3 5 fine sediment dynamics varying with flows as indicated in table 4 an extreme event in year 2012 was simulated by the validated model in order to numerically investigate the fine sediment response to an extreme flood event fig 13 plots the inflow at the pond inlet and the cumulative sediment deposition over the whole period in the study domain clearly we can see a non linear relationship between inflow discharge and cumulative deposition which demonstrates two distinctively different response modes 1 steadily rising e g zone 1 in fig 13a and 2 sharply dropping zone 2 in fig 13a to look at the trend of change in deposition volume and the inflow discharge in fig 13b we found that a high inflow leads to a sharp increase in deposition and consistent low flows increase the sedimentation but with a lower rate however the extreme flows in fig 13b reduce the deposition volume sharply and the higher the inflow the more significant the reduction is fig 14 further demonstrates the changes of pond sedimentation due to the three selected representative events in the year 2012 event 1 2 and 3 in fig 13 it is found that a considerable amount of sediment is trapped during event 1 whilst the extreme events 2 and 3 re suspend the deposited sediment and transport them to the downstream particularly in the area facing the pipe outlet the behaviour is similar to the laboratory event reported in section 3 1 3 at the pipe outlet bed shear stress is sufficiently high to cause re suspension of sediments the two different response modes observed during varying flow conditions raise a hypothesis that is sediment deposition in the pond increases with the inflow discharge but after a critical value where there is a balance between erosion and deposition the bed will be eroded due to the high bed shear stress and the erosion rate is proportional to the inflow magnitude to verify the hypothesis raised above we picked out 24 different flow events with a flow peak varying from 0 2 m3 s to 10 m3 s from the extreme year 2012 and quantified the deposition volume before and after each event fig 15 plots the scatter points between the change in deposition volume and flow peak for each event and the trendlines among the points it can be seen that two trendlines are derived as postulated and both have a good determination coefficient r2 that is larger than 0 8 the deposition volume has a linear relation with a high determination coefficient 0 8775 with the flow discharge the linear relationship of erosion volume and flow discharge is also significant but there is a clear large difference during extreme high flows see fig 15 these two events with significant difference are event 2 and event 3 in fig 14 with a similar high flow event 2 has more severe erosion than event 3 this is because there is significant deposition in the pond before event 2 occurs which allows more sediment to be re suspended during the extreme flow of event 2 however event 3 occurs about 110 h after event 2 the deposited sediment available for re suspension is clearly much less than the pre event 2 volume therefore this leads to a significant bias for the two events with similar high flow discharge we found that there is a critical value defined as balance point of the flow peak and the value is approximately in a range of 1 79 1 96 m3 s for the studied stormwater pond in other words sediment deposition in the stormwater pond increases with the inflow and the rate is proportional to the flow peak when the flow peak is below the balance point however for the flow with a peak above the balance point fine sediment particles will be re suspended and transported downstream and the re suspension rate is proportional to the flow peak clearly this balance point is a transition value causing bed deposition or erosion in the pond this point provides a valuable indicator for stormwater ponds design and maintenance removing sediment from stormwater ponds is needed periodically to maintain proper function and restore capacity to prevent localised flooding traditionally machinery dredging is one option during dry conditions united states environmental protection agency 2009 however the understanding of ponds balance point can suggest a natural hydraulic regulation method so saving maintenance cost and sediments transporting to downstream can also improve the river habitat similar hydraulic regulation method has been used for sustainable sediment management in reservoirs kondolf et al 2014 it should be mentioned that the actual changes in sedimentation volume are also related to inflow volume in addition to flow peak because a larger flow volume means more fine sediments discharging into the pond nonetheless the flow peak is the deterministic factor causing fine sediments either to be deposited in the pond or to be flushed out of the pond 4 conclusions the study has developed a numerical model to track the hydro morphological processes dominated by fine grained suspended sediment including the prediction of sediment concentration in flow bodies and erosion and deposition caused by sediment transport the model has been validated with three laboratory scale test cases where suspended load plays a dominant role the results show that the model is capable of reproducing the flow dynamics and the resultant morphological changes reasonably well applications in real world events are performed to further develop the process based understanding of fine sediment activities in a stormwater pond during varying flow conditions findings drawn from this study include 1 a stormwater pond can be used to attenuate flow peak and trap fine sediment particles and the effect is more significant for flow events with a smaller flow peak 2 a balance point for the inflow peaks determines whether fine sediments settled down or are re suspended and the value is determined in a range of 1 79 1 96 m3 s for the studied pond 3 the consistent low flows lead to gradual accumulation of sediment particles in the pond and each rainfall induced flow event results in a sharp rising in the deposition volume below the balance point but above the value the high flow event will flush away the sedimentation in the pond and 4 the model is capable of quantitatively simulating and qualitatively assessing the performance of a

7543,fine sediment plays crucial and multiple roles in the hydrological ecological and geomorphological functioning of river systems this study employs a two dimensional 2d numerical model to track the hydro morphological processes dominated by fine suspended sediment including the prediction of sediment concentration in flow bodies and erosion and deposition caused by sediment transport the model is governed by 2d full shallow water equations with which an advection diffusion equation for fine sediment is coupled bed erosion and sedimentation are updated by a bed deformation model based on local sediment entrainment and settling flux in flow bodies the model is initially validated with the three laboratory scale experimental events where suspended load plays a dominant role satisfactory simulation results confirm the model s capability in capturing hydro morphodynamic processes dominated by fine suspended sediment at laboratory scale applications to sedimentation in a stormwater pond are conducted to develop the process based understanding of fine sediment dynamics over a variety of flow conditions urban flows with 5 year 30 year and 100 year return period and the extreme flood event in 2012 are simulated the modelled results deliver a step change in understanding fine sediment dynamics in stormwater ponds the model is capable of quantitatively simulating and qualitatively assessing the performance of a stormwater pond in managing urban water quantity and quality keywords shallow water equations suspended load morphological changes stormwater pond 1 introduction in river systems fine grained sediment is a natural and essential component and plays a crucial role in the hydrological ecological and geomorphological functioning of the system it has been recognised that fine grained sediment management in urban rivers is environmentally significant birch et al 2006 sustainable sediment management requires a structure of supporting research on fine sediment dynamics and its interactions within hydrological catchments such as rivers floodplains reservoirs and sustainable urban drainage systems suds owens et al 2005 in general fine grained sediment has a controlling influence on the quality and quantity of receiving water in an urban catchment contaminants and pollutants including heavy metals and nutrients are generally absorbed by fine sediment which is then conveyed to the receiving waters saeedi et al 2004 jartun et al 2008 jones et al 2008 these urban pollutants attached to sediments have implications on both habitats of downstream receiving waters and human health wood and armitage 1997 owens et al 2005 crosa et al 2010 to mitigate these risks more sustainable features such as stormwater ponds are increasingly used in urban catchments as an option to manage fine suspended sediments ahilan et al 2016 allen et al 2017 by storing stormwater runoff trapping fine sediments and improving urban runoff quality the movement of sediment will be minimised by the interrupted flows in a storm water pond the low energy environment in the pond enables the considerable proportion of fine suspended load is trapped which provides water quality benefits to receiving water bodies however from a longer term viewpoint this will diminish the storage capacity of stormwater ponds thereby influencing their hydraulic performance and maintenance similarly fine grained sedimentation occurs in dam reservoirs where the release of deposited sediments often leads to cascading effects in downstream reaches through sediment transport and re deposition liu et al 2004 this has been considered to be a worldwide problem vörömarty et al 2003 additionally excessive suspended sediment inputs to rivers due to catchment erosion and in channel bank erosion can cause sedimentation in channels which may affect channel morphology stream habitats and navigation eekhout et al 2015 in view of the sediment effects natural processes have been widely used for river and flood management in recent years dadson et al 2017 in the aforementioned cases fine suspended sediment has a controlling influence on the quality and quantity of receiving waters in hydro systems through playing a variety of roles therefore there is a need to develop an improved understanding of how fine grained sediment is eroded transported and deposited by a variety of flow environments in recent years numerical models have been increasingly used to understand complex flows sediment transport and the corresponding morphological changes in rivers floodplains and suds in view of the multiple roles of fine grained sediment in receiving waters a robust fine sediment model is crucial to develop coupled models enabling the simulations and understanding of hydrological ecological and geomorphological conditions of catchments recently numerical models have been used to simulate dam break induced in channel evolution cao et al 2004 simpson and castelltort 2006 bohorquez and fernandez feria 2008 zech et al 2008 guan et al 2015a benkhaldoun et al 2012 li and duffy 2012 guan et al 2014 sediment routing in dam reservoirs liu et al 2004 guertault et al 2016 turbidity currents over erodible bed hu and cao 2009 hu et al 2012 janocko et al 2013 this provides feasible mathematical modelling approaches to quantify the evolution of sediment laden flows and corresponding geomorphological changes dominated by fine grained sediment this research presents a 2d numerical tool to track the erosion transport and deposition of fine grained sediment and particularly investigate fine sediment dynamics in stormwater ponds the model is a depth averaged 2d numerical model that includes a robust shallow water based hydrodynamic model a suspended load transport model and a bed evolution model it provides more reliable information than a 1d model whilst being more cost effective than a 3d model the model is capable of simulating full sediment transport process where non cohesive fine suspended load plays a dominant role including both sediment concentration in flow bodies and bed changes this is not only limited to a case with full suspended load transport but also to a case which may have a small portion of bedload whatever this should have a small rouse number lower than 2 5 during the main transport stage the model is firstly validated against three laboratory scale experiments prior to a real world application in a stormwater pond located in newcastle great park uk based on the simulation results this study aims to determine the erosion transport and deposition characteristics of fine sediment in a stormwater pond with various flow conditions and to develop a greater understanding of fine grained sediment dynamics in stormwater ponds 2 numerical model 2 1 hydrodynamic model shallow water based numerical models have been widely used for hydraulic modelling due to their robustness in capturing

cases were used to verify the model capability in simulating morphological changes dominant by fine suspended load which includes 1 sediment transport in a trench 2 partial dam breach flow over a mobile channel and 3 localised erosion and deposition in a pond with erodible bed in all three experimental cases it has been observed that suspended load is the main transport mode which ensures the applicability of the cases in the model verification here the model errors with the measured data were quantified using the brier skill score bss as 13 bss 1 1 n z i o z i m 2 1 n z i o z i t 0 o 2 where superscripts m and o refer to modelled and observed point data respectively and n is the total number of point data 3 1 1 sediment transport in a trench to verify the capability of the proposed model in predicting bed evolution under the conditions of unsteady flows a simulation was carried out to compare with experiments originally conducted at the delft hydraulics laboratory to investigate the movable bed evolution caused by steady open channel flow van rijn 1980 the trench is located in the middle of the 30 m long channel three tests with different side slopes of the trench 1 3 1 7 and 1 10 were performed in the experiments following van rijn 1980 the key information of the three tests is listed in table 1 the mean inflow velocity was 0 51 m s at the inlet and the water depth were kept constant as 0 39 m the erodible bed consists of fine sand with d 10 0 115 mm d 50 0 16 mm and d 90 0 2 mm the sand density and porosity was 2650 kg m3 and 0 4 respectively according to the experiment the settling velocity of sediment particles was 0 013 m s 25 a hindering settling velocity ω 0 0 015 m s is used manning s coefficient n is set to be 0 016 in addition to maintain the sediment equilibrium conditions in the upstream i e no scour or deposition occurring sand with the same composition was fed at a constant rate of 0 04 kg s m thereby the suspended load transport rate was estimated to be 0 03 0 006 kg s m and the bed load transport rate of about 0 01 kg s m the contribution of the suspended load transport to the total load transport was in the range of 60 to 90 for simulation the whole domain is discretised by 150 cells with δx 0 2 m to ensure steady flow the model is run for 900 s after 900 s sand is fed and bed evolution occurs van rijn 1984 suggested estimating the reference level by the following equation a min max k s 2 d 50 0 01 h 0 2 h based on this formulation a 0 01 m and a 0 02 m was used in the model to demonstrate the influence of the reference level fig 1 plots the simulated velocity and depth averaged measurement at the five measured sections it can be seen that the model produces the velocity reasonably well around the trench also the water surface has been simulated to be close to the real constant value 0 39 m regarding the predictin of changes in bed profiles fig 2 indicates that the simulated bed profiles with a 0 01 m and a 0 02 m show similar shape with only a slight difference with both reference levels the simulated bed has a high brier skill score which is over 0 9 when a 0 01 m the model gives a better results therefore the model is also verified in test 2 and test 1 with the reference level a 0 01 m as shown in fig 3 the general bed profiles at both 7 5 h and 15 h are produced with a good bss this implies the capability of the model in simulating bed changes due to sediment transport dominant by suspended load 3 1 2 partial dam breach flow over a mobile channel to verify and validate the performance of the suspended load model it was used to reproduce partial dam breach flow experiments over a mobile bed which were carried out at the hydraulics laboratory of tsinghua university china xia et al 2010 a thin dam was located 2 0 m downstream of a 18 5 m 1 6 m rectangular flume and a 0 2 m wide dam breach centred at y 0 8 m the region of 4 5 m after dam site was covered by fine non uniform coal ash with a median diameter of 0 135 mm and its natural and dry density were measured approximately as 2248 kg m3 and 720 kg m3 respectively the water depth was initially set to be 0 4 m in the reservoir and 0 12 m downstream of the dam in this experiment the bed levels at two cross sections cs1 x 2 5 m and cs2 x 3 5 m after 20 s were measured during the whole experiment only suspended load transport occurs due to the particles being so fine table 2 lists the key parameters used in the simulation for the simulation the domain is discretised by 370 80 cells and the time interval is δt 0 005 s the manning s coefficient n 0 02 s m1 3 the sediment porosity is set as 0 35 the suspended load model is run for 20 s fig 4 shows a comparison between the observed and modelled cross sectional profiles at 20 s it is shown that the trend of the predicted bed profiles is similar to that of the measured profiles erosion occurs in the middle of the cross sections the bed erosion quantity is less than the measurement at cs1 where the predicted bed is underestimated particularly in terms of the erosion width however a similar maximum scour depth and location are predicted here at cs2 the simulated and measured bed profiles are in good agreement with each other the simulated and measured scour depths are very close and the erosion areas agree very well with each other but the measured range of bed profile is about 20 cm wider than the simulated range for this reason it can be seen that the bss for cs2 is relatively smaller the bed deposition is underestimated by the model here this is possibly due to either the experimental errors or the neglected turbulence term which means the model may not be able to generate the rapid formation of horizontal circulating flow at the downstream of the dam fig 5 illustrates the contour plot of the simulated bed topography after 20 s severe erosion occurs at the outlet of the dam and the eroded suspended load is flushed to deposit downstream due to the decrease of bed shear stress 3 1 3 erosion and deposition in a pond with erodible bed the experiment was conducted to investigate the erosion process in a rectangular basin due to clear water inflow from a narrow channel by thuc 1991 in this test the initial setup involves an inlet rectangular channel of 2 0 m long and 0 2 m wide a rectangular movable basin with 5 0 m long and 4 0 m wide and a 1 0 m long and 1 2 m wide channel in the downstream therein the movable basin consists of fine sand with median diameter of 0 6 mm with a movable bed layer was 0 16 m thick for the initial hydraulic conditions initial water depth was specified as 0 15 m the inflow velocity at the inflow boundary was kept constant at 0 6 m s and the water depth at the outlet was a constant value of 0 15 m only basin area is erodible during the experiment period table 3 show the key parameters of the experimental case this experiment is simulated in this study because the sediment particle diameter is small 0 6 mm and the rouse number of the case is estimated to be in a range of 0 2 4 in the main movable area which means suspended load is the dominant transport mode this fits the capability of the present model the length of channel is discretised with a constant interval δx 0 1 m but in width direction the grid spacing around the centreline 0 6 m is set to be finer δy1 0 02 m than that in other parts δy2 0 05 m the computational mesh in the basin consists of 80 116 cells the time step for flow and sediment calculation is set the same at 0 009 s the manning s roughness coefficient n in the basin is given a value of 0 03 s m1 3 the model was run for 2 h of experiment time eq 4 is used to calculate the entrainment and deposition fluxes in this case fig 6 a shows the simulated bed change pattern around the inflow region at the centre part of the basin after 4 h and fig 6 b demonstrates the flow velocity field and bed shear stress it can be seen that the inflow pipe has the biggest bed shear stress due to the high flow velocity and the inflow pipe outfall area and the outlet area also have higher bed shear stress therefore it can be seen that significant erosion occurs at the outfall area due to the inflow of clear water then the eroded sediment moves downstream and deposits forming a hill since only basin area is erodible no bed changes are found at the outlet area fig 7 further shows the comparison of the measured and simulated bed changes along the longitudinal centreline at 1 h 2 h and 4 h all have a satisfying brier skill score bss overall the simulated morphological evolution tendency at 1 h and 2 h are in good agreement with the measured results however the maximum deposition heights are slightly under predicted with a 13 4 difference at 1 h and 30 6 at 2 h furthermore it can be seen that the model overestimates the erosion depth at the inlet of the basin there the simulated erosion is much more severe than the measured erosion this is most likely because secondary flow plays an important role here however these non hydrostatic flows are neglected in the current model 3 2 application in a stormwater pond stomwater ponds are characterised by urban runoff detention runoff quality improvement and sediment trapping the decrease in flow velocity and the low energy environment causes deposition of fine sediments delivered by urban flows as it enters the pond stormwater pond sedimentation leads to a decrease in pond storage capacity and triggers environmental and economic issues the validated model is applied to a case study of a stormwater pond in newcastle great park and based on the results improved understanding of fine sediment dynamics is developed 3 2 1 study site the study area is located in ouseburn catchment the black boundary in fig 8 a in newcaslte upon tyne in the uk the stormwater pond connects the upstream newly built urban development and the ouseburn river fig 8c shows the simulated domain which is an area of 230 m by 140 m it was observed that the pond is covered with dense vegetation which protects the local bed for simulations the flow discharge is input to the model via a pipe section as an upstream boundary the other boundary is set to be free open which means that the floodwater can freely flow out based on the local flow conditions 3 2 2 model scenarios three scenarios were considered non flood 5 year sewer design 30 year and flood 100 year fig 9 a also rainfall events in the extreme flow year 2012 with 15 min interval rainfall measurements at the jesmond dene gauging station ea 19356 were used to conduct an annual sediment simulation and the flow at the inlet for the identified rainfall events is quantified by using the physically based conceptual rainfall runoff model the revitalised flood hydrograph refh model fig 9b allen et al 2015 measured the continuous flow records from january to may 2015 at the pond s outfall the refh rainfall runoff model is calibrated with the observed flow data sets by varying the drainage length parameter dplbar in the model based on the field survey the fine sediment composes of three classes d10 5 µm fine silt d50 12 µm fine silt and d90 50 µm silt that were obtained from the manual sampling and equally distributed as an input in the upstream boundary the fine sediment concentration is estimated based on the regression relationships between flow turbidity and suspended sediment concentration from the analogue catchment ahilan et al 2016 in order to assess the relative impact of the pond on the hydrologic and morphologic responses during high flow events two digital elevation model dem data sets were incorporated in the model setup the current dem represents existing topography with pond condition and the dem corresponding to the year 2000 represents the predevelopment stage without pond scenario in the hydro morphodynamic model table 4 lists the key information about this case study 3 3 model validation with sampling data allen et al 2015 surveyed the cumulative sediment deposition at monthly intervals at six locations in the pond during the monitoring period which is used to validate the morphodynamic model in simulating sediment deposition in the pond flow events between 23 04 2015 and 26 05 2015 as shown in fig 10 were modelled because there are a number of high flow events over the period apart from low base flows fig 10 shows the simulated sediment deposition in the pond and the location of the six monitoring points it indicates that the main deposition area is located at the outfall area this is because the flow velocity sharply decreases after the water flows to the pond from upstream pipe this leads to bed shear stress be so small that sediment particles settle down to the bed resuspension during high flows causes slight sedimentation in the far area from the outfall table 5 shows the measured and simulated depths at the six monitoring points it is indicated that the model predicts the sedimentation in the stormwater pond generally well despite the fact that there are clear discrepancies at some points these differences are expected because of the uncertainty factors in reality the main uncertainty factors include 1 the stormwater pond is covered by a variety of soft vegetation which causes clear implication on flow dynamics and sediment transport however this is difficult to quantify and predict 2 the inflow discharge and sediment concentration are quantified based on a conceptual rainfall runoff model and regression relationship between flow and turbidity thus this brings about uncertainties in model inputs 3 sediment particles are very fine and the sedimentation depth is small the field monitoring quantifies sediment weights rather depths which might cause some errors to quantify its real depth despite of the discrepancies it can be seen that both simulated and measured shows a higher deposition near the outfall location and a smaller sedimentation at the far point from the outfall therefore considering the main objective of this study in developing better understanding of fine suspended load transport the model results are deemed to be adequate 3 4 fine grained sediment tracking during single events the validated model is used in the hydro morphological simulations during single events 5 year flow 30 year flow and 100 year flow fig 11 shows the water depths suspended load concentration and bed shear stress and velocity field during the flow peak for each scenario as well as the resultant sediment deposition in the stormwater pond after each event in the viewpoint of hydrodynamic effects it is clear that the pond has the capability to store the 5 year flow and the sediment particles in the flow bodies are mostly trapped in the stormwater pond fig 11b and gradually settle down in the stormwater pond because of the slow flow velocity and the low bed shear stress however during the 30 year and 100 year flow events fig 11f and j a considerable amount of water flows from the pond into the river which transports fine sediments downstream as shown in fig 11f and j although the waters in the pond still have relative higher suspended load sediment particles are flushed out to the river with the increasing inflow this leads to deposition not only inside the pond but also in the river downstream fig 11g and l table 6 quantifies the input sediments and the deposited sediments for the three scenarios it shows that the increasing of inflow magnitude results in a decrease in sediment trapping efficiency of the pond as expected before building the stormwater pond the urban flows were directly drained into the river the simulated results in fig 12 clearly shows that the direct drainage to the watercourse leads to much wider inundation and sedimentation during flooding in comparison with that with the pond in fig 12 consequently sediment particles are deposited in the inundated areas after flood recession as demonstrated in fig 12f and j even for the more frequent 5 year flow event the direct drainage causes considerable amount of sedimentation in the river channel if there is any the contaminants attached with sediment particles will potentially influence the water quality in the receiving water therefore the simulations imply that the stormwater pond has the benefits of retaining urban flows and trapping sediment particles generated from upstream urban catchment the model is capable of quantitatively simulating and qualitatively assessing the performance of a stormwater pond in managing urban floods 3 5 fine sediment dynamics varying with flows as indicated in table 4 an extreme event in year 2012 was simulated by the validated model in order to numerically investigate the fine sediment response to an extreme flood event fig 13 plots the inflow at the pond inlet and the cumulative sediment deposition over the whole period in the study domain clearly we can see a non linear relationship between inflow discharge and cumulative deposition which demonstrates two distinctively different response modes 1 steadily rising e g zone 1 in fig 13a and 2 sharply dropping zone 2 in fig 13a to look at the trend of change in deposition volume and the inflow discharge in fig 13b we found that a high inflow leads to a sharp increase in deposition and consistent low flows increase the sedimentation but with a lower rate however the extreme flows in fig 13b reduce the deposition volume sharply and the higher the inflow the more significant the reduction is fig 14 further demonstrates the changes of pond sedimentation due to the three selected representative events in the year 2012 event 1 2 and 3 in fig 13 it is found that a considerable amount of sediment is trapped during event 1 whilst the extreme events 2 and 3 re suspend the deposited sediment and transport them to the downstream particularly in the area facing the pipe outlet the behaviour is similar to the laboratory event reported in section 3 1 3 at the pipe outlet bed shear stress is sufficiently high to cause re suspension of sediments the two different response modes observed during varying flow conditions raise a hypothesis that is sediment deposition in the pond increases with the inflow discharge but after a critical value where there is a balance between erosion and deposition the bed will be eroded due to the high bed shear stress and the erosion rate is proportional to the inflow magnitude to verify the hypothesis raised above we picked out 24 different flow events with a flow peak varying from 0 2 m3 s to 10 m3 s from the extreme year 2012 and quantified the deposition volume before and after each event fig 15 plots the scatter points between the change in deposition volume and flow peak for each event and the trendlines among the points it can be seen that two trendlines are derived as postulated and both have a good determination coefficient r2 that is larger than 0 8 the deposition volume has a linear relation with a high determination coefficient 0 8775 with the flow discharge the linear relationship of erosion volume and flow discharge is also significant but there is a clear large difference during extreme high flows see fig 15 these two events with significant difference are event 2 and event 3 in fig 14 with a similar high flow event 2 has more severe erosion than event 3 this is because there is significant deposition in the pond before event 2 occurs which allows more sediment to be re suspended during the extreme flow of event 2 however event 3 occurs about 110 h after event 2 the deposited sediment available for re suspension is clearly much less than the pre event 2 volume therefore this leads to a significant bias for the two events with similar high flow discharge we found that there is a critical value defined as balance point of the flow peak and the value is approximately in a range of 1 79 1 96 m3 s for the studied stormwater pond in other words sediment deposition in the stormwater pond increases with the inflow and the rate is proportional to the flow peak when the flow peak is below the balance point however for the flow with a peak above the balance point fine sediment particles will be re suspended and transported downstream and the re suspension rate is proportional to the flow peak clearly this balance point is a transition value causing bed deposition or erosion in the pond this point provides a valuable indicator for stormwater ponds design and maintenance removing sediment from stormwater ponds is needed periodically to maintain proper function and restore capacity to prevent localised flooding traditionally machinery dredging is one option during dry conditions united states environmental protection agency 2009 however the understanding of ponds balance point can suggest a natural hydraulic regulation method so saving maintenance cost and sediments transporting to downstream can also improve the river habitat similar hydraulic regulation method has been used for sustainable sediment management in reservoirs kondolf et al 2014 it should be mentioned that the actual changes in sedimentation volume are also related to inflow volume in addition to flow peak because a larger flow volume means more fine sediments discharging into the pond nonetheless the flow peak is the deterministic factor causing fine sediments either to be deposited in the pond or to be flushed out of the pond 4 conclusions the study has developed a numerical model to track the hydro morphological processes dominated by fine grained suspended sediment including the prediction of sediment concentration in flow bodies and erosion and deposition caused by sediment transport the model has been validated with three laboratory scale test cases where suspended load plays a dominant role the results show that the model is capable of reproducing the flow dynamics and the resultant morphological changes reasonably well applications in real world events are performed to further develop the process based understanding of fine sediment activities in a stormwater pond during varying flow conditions findings drawn from this study include 1 a stormwater pond can be used to attenuate flow peak and trap fine sediment particles and the effect is more significant for flow events with a smaller flow peak 2 a balance point for the inflow peaks determines whether fine sediments settled down or are re suspended and the value is determined in a range of 1 79 1 96 m3 s for the studied pond 3 the consistent low flows lead to gradual accumulation of sediment particles in the pond and each rainfall induced flow event results in a sharp rising in the deposition volume below the balance point but above the value the high flow event will flush away the sedimentation in the pond and 4 the model is capable of quantitatively simulating and qualitatively assessing the performance of a

7544,regional climate models rcms are used to downscale the coarse resolution general circulation model gcm outputs to a finer resolution for hydrological impact studies however rcm outputs often deviate from the observed climatological data and therefore need bias correction before they are used for hydrological simulations while there are a number of methods for bias correction most of them use monthly statistics to derive correction factors which may cause errors in the rainfall magnitude when applied on a daily scale this study proposes a sliding window based daily correction factor derivations that help build reliable daily rainfall data from climate models the procedure is applied to five existing bias correction methods and is tested on six watersheds in different climatic zones of india for assessing the effectiveness of the corrected rainfall and the consequent hydrological simulations the bias correction was performed on rainfall data downscaled using conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam to 0 5 0 5 from two different cmip5 models cnrm cm5 0 gfdl cm3 0 the india meteorological department imd gridded 0 25 0 25 observed rainfall data was considered to test the effectiveness of the proposed bias correction method the quantile quantile q q plots and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were employed for evaluation of different methods of bias correction the analysis suggested that the proposed method effectively corrects the daily bias in rainfall as compared to using monthly factors the methods such as local intensity scaling modified power transformation and distribution mapping which adjusted the wet day frequencies performed superior compared to the other methods which did not consider adjustment of wet day frequencies the distribution mapping method with daily correction factors was able to replicate the daily rainfall pattern of observed data with nse value above 0 81 over most parts of india hydrological simulations forced using the bias corrected rainfall distribution mapping and modified power transformation methods that used the proposed daily correction factors was similar to those simulated by the imd rainfall the results demonstrate that the methods and the time scales used for bias correction of rcm rainfall data have a larger impact on the accuracy of the daily rainfall and consequently the simulated streamflow the analysis suggests that the distribution mapping with daily correction factors can be preferred for adjusting rcm rainfall data irrespective of seasons or climate zones for realistic simulation of streamflow keywords hydrological modelling rcm bias correction distribution mapping swat 1 introduction global warming is likely to exert considerable impact on the hydrological cycle everett et al 1996 that subsequently influence water resources general circulation models gcms are widely used to assess the impacts of global warming on time mean changes in climate and subsequently on the hydrologic cycle it is well recognized that these gcms realistically capture large scale circulation patterns and demonstrate high skill in simulating variables which have high degree of spatial uniformity such as surface pressure wind speed or temperature the horizontal resolutions at which gcms operate 100 200 km has obvious limitations in resolving and representing small scale features that impact rainfall characteristics and hence moisture related variables from these coarse resolution gcms cannot be used directly for hydrological water resources impact modelling studies in meso local scales hansen et al 2006 sharma et al 2007 chen et al 2011 salvi et al 2013 downscaling techniques have been developed to derive regional information about climate variables from coarse resolution gcm outputs themeßl et al 2011 these techniques take into account regional forcings such as orography lakes and land surface characteristics which influence the local climate murphy 1999 there are two approaches to downscale gcm simulations viz statistical and dynamical downscaling the statistical downscaling sd approach establishes empirical relationship between large scale climate patterns and local climate variables and incorporate these relationships to gcm outputs to derive regional information fowler et al 2007 in dynamical downscaling dd approach a high resolution regional climate model rcm is nested with gcm outputs to derive physically consistent regional weather and climate parameters with sufficient details sd and dd methods both have their strengths and shortcomings sd methods are more easy to implement and computationally efficient hewitson and crane 1996 however it is based on the assumption that statistical relationship between large and local scale processes remains stationary in future climate time period this assumption is perhaps not true given the non linear and non stationary nature of the evolving climate furthermore to apply sd needs sufficiently long term observed data to derive robust statistical relationships for regions of interest there are several approaches that have been developed over the years to overcome these limitations of sd methods hessami et al 2008 jeong et al 2012 khalili et al 2013 ben alaya et al 2015 bhowmik et al 2017 dd method on the other hand is complex and difficult to implement dd uses high resolution rcm model forced with gcm simulated state variables at its lateral boundary along with surface boundary conditions and hence provides finer resolution climate variables christensen et al 2001 king et al 2012 dd is considered to be very effective in physically characterizing the spatial distribution of climate trends through process based modelling of the atmospheric system thus improving simulation of non stationarity in the climate dynamics dell aquila et al 2012 and could improve the inter annual variability simulated by the gcm by realistically capturing the role of local feedbacks guyennon et al 2013 hence dd method is more useful for hydrological model impact studies however rcms are subjected to bias introduced by the systematic errors in the driving gcm variables along with its own biases due to model formulation paimazumder and done 2015 in order to obtain reliable climate simulations the biases are adjusted using different techniques christensen et al 2008 typically on a monthly scale which can be used further for hydrological impact studies as the study of current climate hydrology relationships forms the foundation step for future climate change simulations and its effect on water resource management more reliable and accurate estimates of climate variables become vital this study aims at providing realistic estimates of rainfall simulations from climate models at daily time scale by proposing a new methodology for bias correction of rcm derived rainfall data which is useful for hydrological modelling studies in the context of climate change 2 review of literature the reliability of the rcm output and its further use for hydrologic impact studies are highly dependent on the chosen region of study chen et al 2013 in a chosen region simulation of rcm rainfall is influenced by regional features such as topography land cover land use salvi et al 2013 and non linear interactions between large scale dynamical and local thermodynamic processes rainfall being a highly complex variable modelling its behaviour at daily time scales and further at meso local scales 10 50 km pose yet another challenge to climate modellers this challenge is amplified further due to lack of direct observations to constrain and improve model physics the realistic representation of daily rainfall from climate models play a decisive role in the impact assessment studies and to assure meaningful runoff simulations from hydrological models bias correction of climate model outputs is essential wood et al 2004 eden et al 2012 salvi et al 2013 chen et al 2013 further in most of the catchments main factor contributing towards runoff is rainfall hence the selection of a particular bias correction method is more pronounced in the case of rainfall haerter et al 2011 chen et al 2013 in this regard several bias correction methods have been developed with varying level of complexities to correct the rcm simulations these include correcting the mean to more advanced methods such as correction of both mean and variance with further advancement in adjusting the quantile values sunyer et al 2014 linear scaling and local intensity scaling are mean based approaches in which the former correct the monthly means while the latter correct the wet day frequencies and intensities along with the monthly mean chen et al 2013 power transformation method adjusts the mean and variance of rainfall data leander et al 2008 but not the wet day frequencies and intensities distribution mapping or quantile mapping is a distribution based approach which corrects the mean and variance together with wet day frequencies and intensities teutschbein and seibert 2012 li et al 2010 developed a new method for bias correction called equidistance quantile matching method based on mixed gamma distribution that accounts for the distribution changes between the baseline and future time periods though the results indicated that this method was skilful to incorporate the changed variability and was superior to quantile based mapping method but was applied for monthly rainfall from gcms piani et al 2010 validated a statistical bias correction method based on distribution mapping method with gamma distribution and the performance was good for seasonal means heavy rainfall events and seasonal drought index but not for the daily rainfall events lafon et al 2012 compared the performance of linear non linear gamma based quantile mapping and empirical distribution based quantile mapping methods and found out that mean and standard deviation of daily rainfall can be effectively corrected while the correction of skewness and kurtosis of daily rainfall are sensitive to the choice of bias correction method and calibration period although gamma based quantile mapping method provides better results where the variability in rainfall was captured by gamma distribution the study employed monthly gamma parameters to correct the daily rainfall data the performance of distribution derived parametric and nonparametric transformations were compared by gudmundsson et al 2012 and identified that nonparametric transformations possess good proficiency in the reduction of biases in rainfall simulated by rcms while assessing hydrological response to climate change teutschbein and seibert 2012 reported that all bias correction methods improved rcm outputs rainfall and temperature and distribution mapping method was found to be superior for hydrological simulation but the corrections employed monthly factors a histogram equalization bias correction method was applied by argüeso et al 2013 that could considerably reduce the seasonal and daily biases of rainfall even in areas where the rainfall is over estimated and in areas where the wet day conditions are not met as the driving mechanism of rainfall varies throughout the year the bias correction was applied on a seasonal basis and the gamma parameters were estimated for each season separately fang et al 2015 reported that power transformation and quantile mapping method performed better in correcting standard deviation and percentile values but employed monthly correction factors at daily time scale to correct the temporal scale biases maurer et al 2010 applied bias correction on a daily basis using the daily average precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures for a particular month while some studies have employed quantile mapping method at daily timescale using a 31 day moving window approach themeß1 et al 2011 thrasher et al 2012 wilcke et al 2013 further advancements in the area of bias correction with multiple scales and nested approaches at daily scale has been attempted mehrotra and sharma 2012 mehrotra and sharma 2015 another advancement was seen in the deployment of multiple timescales with a three tier cascade bias correction method proposed by haerter et al 2011 which can operate on different timescales separately which could reproduce the statistics of the observed data at various timescales johnson and sharma 2012 developed a nested bias correction approach based on the assumption of a linear autoregressive model that could correct the mean standard deviation and lag 1 autocorrelations of gcm simulations at the monthly and annual time scales which performed well when the biases are not too large mehrotra and sharma 2012 proposed a recursive nested bias correction approach which is an extension of the nested bias correction which includes five specified time scales and more than three iterations to improve the bias corrected results and was found to be more effective in correcting distribution and persistence attributes at various time scales mehrotra and sharma 2015 developed multivariate recursive nesting bias correction approach which simultaneously corrects multiple climate variables at different levels of temporal aggregation to replicate distributional and persistence properties of observed data at multiple time scales to achieve good results across all variables and time scales considered a further modification of this method known as multivariate recursive quantile nesting bias correction was proposed by mehrotra and sharma 2016 which focused at the correction of lag 1 dependence and cross dependence attributes across multiple time scales and found that the representation of variability and persistence related attributes good nguyen et al 2016 presented a frequency based bias correction method which employs fourier transform and is independent of the choice of timescale for gcm based monthly precipitation and found that the performance was good for first and second moment statistics and persistence based attributes at multiple time scales recently much thrust has been given to bivariate distribution of rainfall and temperature for correcting their joint distribution which could reduce the biases not only in the mean and variance but also in the correlation between the two variables li et al 2014 a multivariate empirical copula bias correction ec bc proposed by vrac and friederichs 2015 combines one dimensional bias correction and reshuffling of multivariate spatiotemporal data based on the rank structure derived from training data to obtain realistic inter variable spatial and temporal dependencies but makes stationarity assumption which could only replicate patterns derived from historical series a bias correction method which combines principal components and quantile mapping was attempted by hnilica et al 2017 which takes into account correction of multivariate data sets and could substantially reduce the bias in the distribution of individual variables covariance and correlation structures of daily precipitation but spatial dependence structure of daily precipitation was only corrected and the dependence between climate variables was not attempted cannon 2016 developed a multivariate bias correction mbc algorithm which is a multidimensional analog of univariate quantile mapping method and corrects the dependence structure of pearson correlation and spearman rank correlation to match the observed distribution the performance of mbc was much convincing compared to the univariate quantile mapping method but was applied on monthly time series a further improvisation of multivariate bias correction method was adapted cannon 2017 by implementing n dimensional probability density function transform algorithm mbcn which could transfer all characteristics of observed multivariate distribution to the corresponding multivariate distribution of climate projections though the results were closely matching with the observed data for spatio temporal autocorrelation of rainfall data the method possess high computational complexities however dosio and paruolo 2011 reported that univariate bias correction methods have prominence over multivariate methods when a good measure of dependence among climatic variables are accounted for moreover rarely multivariate approach aims at conserving the dependence between more than two variable hempel et al 2013 even though immense progress has been achieved in recent years in the development and assessment of bias correction methods temporal variation of rainfall was accounted only in few studies while correcting the daily rcm rainfall many of the existing bias correction methods which are performed on a monthly basis by grouping data into months or seasons often result in masking the characteristics of daily rainfall kim et al 2015 the day to day variability in the rainfall characteristics are mainly caused by the magnitude of diurnal cycle and local weather synoptic system haerter et al 2011 hence when a bias correction is performed based on correction factors estimated month seasonal basis and applied on a daily timescale the variations of daily rainfall cannot be accurately incorporated due to sharp transition in the bias correction factors between one month season and another month season this sharp transition in bias correction factor can distort the daily characteristics of rainfall moreover for climate change impact studies most of the hydrological models require good quality rainfall data at daily time scale for obtaining realistic flow simulations hence an improved bias correction method which accounts for variability of rainfall at daily time scale is vital for use in climate change studies and has been focused in the present study therefore in this study we propose a method to account for the temporal variability in daily rainfall by performing bias correction of daily rainfall with daily correction factors using a sliding window technique the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated for different climatic zones across india and is shown to perform better than those methods that depend on monthly correction factors further the impact of proposed method on hydrologic simulation of river discharges using soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is evaluated for six catchments in india each located in different climatic zones 3 study area and climate datasets the study area fig 1 consists of six catchments achankovil vaippar birhidhang ken subarnarekha and sabarmathi river basins of india each representing different regional climate and the details of which are given in table 1 specifically these regions were chosen based on the timing amount and monsoonal characteristics south west or north east of rainfall i achankovil river located in the state of kerala originates from the western ghat mountain range in the southern peninsula the basin receives rainfall during both south west summer monsoon june to september as well as north east retreating monsoon october to december ii vaippar river also originates from the western ghat mountain range but on the leeward side rain shadow region located in the state of tamil nadu the rainfall in the basin is characterized by north east monsoon accounting for the majority of the rainfall iii birhidhang river which is an important south bank tributary of brahmaputra river flows through the states of assam and arunachal pradesh the basin receives heavy monsoonal rain during south west monsoon however the basin also receives intermittent thundershowers during the dry seasons of march to may the basin experiences cold humid winter with shorter summer iv ken river originates from north west slopes of kaimur hills flows through the states of uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh before joining river yamuna the basin which is fed mostly by the south west monsoon 90 of annual rainfall is situated in subtropical humid climatic zone of india and experiences dry winter and very dry summer v subarnarekha river originates from chotanagpur plateau flows through the states of jharkhand west bengal and odissa before its confluence with bay of bengal the basin is mostly influenced by the south west monsoon and receives 90 of rainfall during june october the basin experiences a humid sub tropical climate with hot summer and mild winters vi sabarmathi river originates from aravalli hills of rajasthan the basin is located in the hot arid regions of western india and experiences hot summer with temperature ranges of 42 c 45 c and moderate winter the basin receives its 95 of the annual rainfall during the monsoon months of june september the river flows through states of rajasthan and gujarat before draining into gulf of cambay of arabian sea this study uses a high resolution 0 25 x 0 25 gridded daily rainfall data obtained from india meteorological department imd for the period 1901 2013 pai et al 2014 as temperature data at the same resolution was not available gridded daily temperature data at the resolution of 1 1 latitude longitude developed by imd for the period 1969 2005 was used srivastava et al 2009 the two best performing gcms for the indian subcontinent were selected for this study based on the model evaluation works by sperber et al 2012 sengupta and rajeevan 2013 and hasson et al 2014 sperber et al 2012 assessed the performance of cmip3 and cmip5 models in simulating the asian summer monsoon based on statistical metrics the study concluded that gcms fidelity in simulating the indian monsoon is still low however they identified that cnrm cm5 0 and gfdl cm3 0 models realistically simulate the june september summer rainfall climatology over the indian monsoon region the current study thus adopts cnrm cm5 0 and gfdl cm3 0 models of cmip5 versions the data from these two gcms downscaled to 0 5 0 5 using the rcm conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam for the reference period 1970 2005 was obtained from coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex for south asia from the centre for climate change research cccr indian institute of tropical meteorology http cccr tropmet res in cordex for this study the downscaled rcm rainfall data was used for the evaluation of various bias correction methods the current study used 90 m digital elevation model dem from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm for delineating the watershed the land cover data developed by national remote sensing centre nrsc india from awifs sensor at 56 m resolution was used the soil map used for hydrologic modelling was harmonized world soil database v 1 2 nachtergaele et al 2008 obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations 4 methodology the existing approaches used for bias correction of rainfall data aims at correcting bias in rcm simulations by employing a transformation algorithm to correct daily values based on statistics and data pooled for each month instead in this study we are proposing to apply these transformation algorithms for correcting daily rainfall values based on statistics from data pooled for a 31 day sliding window the basic principle involved in the estimation of daily correction factors is to employ a sliding window approach for each of the 365 days in a year over the available number of years of observed rainfall data in order to choose a minimum of 100 rainy day values so as to ensure a good number of data points for obtaining probability distribution plots for this window sizes ranging from 10 to 40 days around each of the 365 days in a year were tested and it was observed that a minimum window size of 31 days centred around each day of the year was acceptable in obtaining a set of at least 100 rainy days from the 30 year record during dry months across different study areas these selected rainy day values were further used in the various bias correction methods to estimate the daily correction factors which were used for corrections of rcm simulations for this rainfall data from rcm grids were bias corrected with respect to that of the nearest imd gridded rainfall data the bias correction methods based on both daily and monthly correction factors are evaluated based on nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and quantile quantile q q plots with respect to imd data prior to bias correction the extent to which various rcms capture the regional distribution of the monsoon and rainfall pattern was analysed based on the frequency and magnitude of rainfall the data obtained from imd was used as observed data to assess the fidelity of the rcms in reproducing rainfall characteristics of current climate as the comparison of number of rainy days and rainfall volume provides a simple and effective way to assess the performance of cmip5 models with observed data it was used to assess the effectiveness of the selected models in representing the climate of the study area the effect of bias correction methods on hydrological model simulations are studied based on long term median hydrographs flow duration curves and streamflow quantiles for six catchments with different climatology using two cmip5 models gfdl and cnrm the estimation of different correction factors for different bias correction methods and their performance were all evaluated for the same time period 1974 2005 4 1 bias correction methods in this study five bias correction methods based on daily correction factors have been tested including a modification proposed to the power transformation method the details of the methods are explained in the following sections 4 1 1 linear scaling ls of rainfall lenderink et al 2007 proposed linear scaling approach of bias correction based on monthly correction values the rainfall is corrected with a multiplicative ratio of observed monthly mean to the uncorrected data rcm data for the baseline historic run in this study the correction is based on multiplier term on a daily basis using a 31 day sliding window 1 p cor d p rcm d μ p obs d μ p rcm d where p cor d and p rcm d are corrected and uncorrected rainfall respectively on day d and μ represents the expected value for the 31 day sliding window for the day d 4 1 2 local intensity scaling loci of rainfall many a time the climate models gcm rcm rain frequently drizzle effect albeit in small quantities which may skew the statistics used for bias correction hence schmidli et al 2006 presented local intensity scaling which could adjust the mean as well as both wet day frequencies and wet day intensities of rainfall time series threshold rainfall p th d is fixed such that the number of rainy days above 2 4 mm definition of a light rainy day as per india meteorological department in the observed and the simulated records are of similar length over a 30 year period further rcm rainfall is corrected by redefining days with rainfall less than p th d as dry days with no rainfall and for rainfall more than p th d the threshold value is subtracted from the rcm rainfall the linear scaling factor s d is estimated by the following ratio 2 s d μ p obs d p obs d 0 μ p rcm d p rcm d p th d p th d the correction factor thus derived is applied to the rainfall data as given in eq 3 3 p cor d 0 if p rcm d p th d p rcm d p th d s d otherwise in this study a slight modification of existing loci method was applied which includes rainfall thresholding prior to multiplying linear scaling factor s d and p th d was calculated on a daily basis for a 31 day sliding window this could remove most of the very light rainy days 4 1 3 power transformation pwtr of rainfall the power transformation method uses an exponential form apb to adjust the variance of rainfall series leander and buishand 2007 leander et al 2008 the parameter b is calculated on a daily basis for a 31 day sliding window by matching the co efficient of variation of observed and rcm daily rainfall series the exponential term b for each day is estimated which minimizes the function 4 f b d σ p obs d μ p obs d σ p rcm d b d μ p rcm d b d where b d is the exponent for the dth day σ represents the standard deviation and μ represents the mean of the rainfall p obs d and p rcm d indicates the observed rainfall and uncorrected rcm rainfall for the baseline scenario for the day d following which an intermediary corrected rainfall p rcm d is estimated thereafter the scaling parameter s d which is the ratio of observed mean and mean of the intermediary corrected rainfall is calculated the final corrected rainfall series p cor is obtained by multiplying the intermediary corrected rainfall with the scaling parameter 5 p rcm d p rcm d b d 6 s d μ p obs d μ p rcm d 7 p cor p rcm d s d 4 1 4 modified power transformation mpwtr of rainfall the power transformation method does not correct the biases in the wet day frequencies and intensities teutschbein and seibert 2012 caused by the drizzle effect of the models hence we tested a hybrid method of combining rainfall thresholding similar to loci prior to applying correction by power transformation method at first rainfall threshold was calculated for the rcm rainfall data as explained in loci method section 4 1 2 so that the wet day frequencies are similar in rcm as those in imd thereafter rcm rainfall was corrected by redefining days with rainfall less than p th d as dry days with no rainfall and for rainfall more than p th d the rcm rainfall was shifted by p th d the equations employed for modified power transformation are given as in eqs 8 11 8 f b d σ p obs d μ p obs d σ p rcm d p th d b d μ p rcm d p th d b d 9 p rcm d p rcm d p th d b d 10 s d μ p obs d μ p rcm d 11 p cor p rcm d s d 4 1 5 distribution mapping dm of rainfall the distribution mapping method corrects the distribution function of rcm simulated rainfall in such a manner that it agrees with the distribution function of observed time series quantile quantile mapping or q q mapping the shifting of distributions to correct the rcm simulations with respect to observed rainfall can be achieved with the help of a transfer function sennikovs and bethers 2009 for each site various probability distributions such as gamma gumbel weibul normal and lognormal were applied to the rainfall series and were tested for the goodness of fit using kolmogorov smirnov k s test in the present study gamma distribution was found to be the best fitting distribution for rainfall data from different climate and for different seasons throughout the year gamma distribution function was constructed for rcm simulated rainfall values with shape parameter α and scale parameter β as given in eq 12 12 f x α β x α 1 1 β α e x β x 0 α β 0 as the higher number of rainy days in the simulated record due to the drizzle effect could skew the fitted distribution rainfall thresholding as explained in section 4 1 2 was subtracted from the rcm rainfall so as to remove the days with very low rainfall the shape and scale parameters for all the 365 days were found out for the observed and rcm simulated rainfall on a daily basis using a 31 day sliding window centred on day d the inverse of gamma distribution function was found out for these gamma cumulative distribution function values with the corresponding day s shape and scale parameter of observed values this value is taken as the corrected rcm rainfall for the current climate condition this procedure of q q mapping can be expressed mathematically as 13 p cor d f γ 1 f γ p rcm d α rcm d β rcm d α obs d β obs d 4 2 impact of bias correction on hydrologic model simulation of river discharges the uncertainties introduced by the climate and hydrological models combined with the natural climate variability muerth et al 2013 affects the amount of simulated streamflow from the catchment in this study to illustrate the effect of various bias correction methods on the hydrologic response of a catchment the hydrological model swat was employed the swat model parameters were not calibrated as the intention was to understand the effect of different bias correction methods of rainfall on the hydrologic response of the catchment while keeping the swat model parameters the same between simulations so the only difference among the simulations of a river basin is the rainfall data from different bias correction methods the rainfall and temperature data of the selected downscaled gcms were directly used to run the swat model without any bias correction and then with the various bias corrected rainfall data this was then compared with swat simulations with imd gridded weather data observed this helps in assessing whether the bias correction methods applied to downscaled rainfall data when used for hydrological modelling are able to simulate streamflows comparable to those simulated using imd gridded rainfall data swat model simulations were performed for the time period from 1970 to 2005 with a model warm up period of four years hence only the streamflow simulations from 1974 to 2005 was used for further analysis the proposed methodology was applied on six river basins located on different climate zones within india the effect of bias correction methods on hydrological model simulations were studied based on comparing long term median monthly hydrographs and flow duration curves simulated using bias corrected rainfall data compared to those obtained using simulations with imd gridded weather data 5 results and discussions the temporal characteristics of observed and simulated number of rainy days and rainfall magnitude above 2 4 mm definition of a light rainy day as per india meteorological department during each month long term monthly average before bias correction were compared to assess the performance of selected gcms in six basins falling in different climatic zones fig 2 the results of average number of rainy days and rainfall amounts for uncorrected rcm data are presented for one representative rcm grid 0 5 0 5 for each basin analysis of the total number of rainy days simulated in a year over a 30 year simulation period by both cnrm cm5 0 and gfdl cm3 0 compares reasonably well with average number of rainy days from imd gridded data for all catchments except vaippar basin which is located in the semi arid zone rain shadow region however there are considerable differences in the average number of rainy days simulated in all the basins on a monthly basis fig 2 including the month with highest number of rainy days the inter model variability between the two best performing climate models is very minimal figs 2 and 3 as mentioned earlier the achankovil basin which is on the windward side of the western ghats experiences two rainfall seasons south west monsoon and north east monsoon fig 2 a however the gcms seem to simulate primarily the south west monsoon which is a major rainfall season for much of the indian sub continent the north east or retreating monsoon caused due to high pressure because of the cooling of landmass over the himalayas and the indo gangetic plain after the autumnal equinox september this brings air mass laden with moisture from bay of bengal and northern indian ocean resulting in substantial rainfall in several parts of southern peninsula kerala and tamil nadu even the best performing gcms selected for this region do not seem to capture the spatial and temporal aspect of this retreating monsoon this could be observed even in the simulation of rainy days for vaippar basin on the leeward side of the western ghats east of achankovil basin which dominantly receives rainfall only during the north east monsoon fig 2 b however both the gcms simulate higher rainy days in vaippar basin even during the south west monsoon 2 3 times higher than observed number of rainy days perhaps due to the problem of drizzle effect in the models in this region in terms of average monthly rainfall magnitude for achankovil basin both the gcms seem to reasonably capture the magnitude of south west monsoon rainfall but not the north east monsoon fig 3 a for vaippar basin even though the number of rainy days in the north east monsoon was over estimated by the gcms the total rainfall magnitude was simulated well with an overestimation of rainfall magnitude during the south west monsoon fig 3 b birhidhang basin is located in the north east corner of india in humid subtropical climate without any dry season the dominant rainy season is the south west monsoon with peak rainy days and rainfall quantities during the month of july figs 2 c and 3 c compared to observations though the rainy days and rainfall quantities are reasonably simulated by the climate models the simulated peak monsoon season is ahead by two months which clearly indicates the lacuna of even the best climate models in capturing the regional processes ken basin located in central india originating in the kaimur hills with humid subtropical climate experiences peak monsoon season during the month of july the climate models seem to simulate the rainy days reasonably well but with a one month shift advance in the peak monsoonal occurrence figs 2 d and 3 d however the rainfall magnitudes were highly underestimated by both the best performing climate models this again indicates the lacuna of the existing climate models subarnarekha basin is located in eastern india and experiences a tropical wet and dry climate the dominant rainy season is the south west monsoon with peak rainy days and rainfall quantities during the month of july figs 2 e and 3 e although the rainy days are reasonably simulated by the climate models the models simulate the peak monsoon season two months ahead of the actual monsoon peak similar to birhidhang basin which clearly indicates the lacuna of even the best climate models in capturing the indian summer monsoon the climate models also underestimate the rainfall magnitude by as much as 50 of the observed rainfall over the 30 year record sabarmathi basin is located in western india and experiences an arid climate with a dominant rainy season of south west monsoon with peak rainy days and rainfall quantities during the month of july figs 2 f and 3 f the rainy days are reasonably simulated by the climate models however the models clearly underestimate the rainfall quantities by as much as 60 of observed rainfall in summary the climate models tend to capture the peak rainfall during the south west monsoon season earlier by as much as one to two months although the number of rainy days simulated in the regions dominated by the south west monsoon is comparable to the observed data the models seem to underestimate the rainfall magnitudes by as much as 50 in many cases except in the north east portion birhidhang basin where there is a slight over estimation of rainfall further in the regions experiencing north east monsoon retreating monsoon in the southern peninsula the models exhibit extreme drizzle effect this is apparent in the vaippar basin where the number of rainy days simulated by the models is as much as two to three times higher than the observations while the rainfall magnitudes are comparable at the moment this lacuna exhibited by the climate models can only be rectified by bias correction techniques while the science of climate modelling is progressing to improve the model representations 5 1 performance evaluation of bias correction methods 5 1 1 q q plots of bias correction methods with daily correction factors q q plots provide useful comparison of the response of rainfall distribution across various bias corrected rainfall values in order to compare the overall performance of each bias correction method based on daily correction factors we first evaluated the quantiles of observed uncorrected and bias corrected rcm simulations for a chosen day for both the cmip5 models for selected grids of all six catchments this was done to evaluate whether the daily distribution of observed rainfall could be replicated by this new bias adjustment methodology based on daily correction factors as a demonstration of this q q plot of cmip5 cnrm cm5 0 gfdl cm3 0 models for achankovil basin on the 160th day 31 day window centred on 160th day during the peak of south west monsoon is shown in fig 4 as indicated by the fig 4 a and b all the bias correction methods based on daily correction factors consistently show improved performance for both the cmip5 models in achankovil basin with high nse values above 0 9 fig 4 a and b indicates that the performance of distribution mapping dm modified power transformation mpwtr and local intensity scaling loci methods closely followed the imd values observed rainfall for gfdl cm3 0 in achankovil basin pwtr method underestimated the high rainfall values for gfdl cm3 0 model while for cnrm cm5 0 model all the bias correction methods followed the imd values with dm method performance better than the others the same procedure was repeated for other catchments also and it was observed that in all the six basins daily based bias correction methods greatly improved the rainfall values when compared to imd values hence q q plot for a particular day could clearly bring out the improvement achieved by various bias correction methods based on daily correction factor even though the performance of different methods varied depending on rainfall parameters adjusted eg mean intensity variance or distribution of rainfall bias correction of daily rainfall was also carried out using monthly bias correction factors without the sliding 31 day window as detailed in teutschbein and seibert 2012 the q q plot for the 160th day for the same grid based on monthly correction factors applied on a daily basis fig 5 show a significantly lower performance with nse values varying from 0 56 to 0 84 for different methods when compared to the q q plots based on daily correction factors thus the results figs 4 and 5 indicate that irrespective of the bias correction method the daily correction factors could considerably improve the bias correction when compared to the monthly correction factors 5 1 2 comparison of performance statistics of bias correction methods with daily and monthly correction factors statistical evaluation of bias correction methods with daily and monthly correction factors was carried out for all the catchments using the performance measure nash sutcliffe efficiency nse based on the q q comparison as explained in the previous section nse was estimated for each of the 365 days in a year for the entire dataset for various bias correction methods and uncorrected data with reference to the imd gridded rainfall data observed the distribution of nse values for each grid for 365 days was assessed with box and whisker plots for brevity and illustration purpose the box plot comparison of nse values only for achankovil basin fig 6 is shown as a representative plot the nse values obtained for monthly correction factors based bias correction method was considerably lower than that of the daily based method and also vary over a very broad range this observation is also consistent across other catchments it could be seen from the box plot fig 6 a that for loci mpwtr and dm method the nse values are high for both the cmip5 models cnrm cm5 0 and gfdl cm3 0 although the nse values of pwtr for gfdl cm3 0 model are high but are distributed across abroad range of values as seen from the box plot fig 6 b the nse values are considerably lower across all bias correction methods by adopting the correction factor on a monthly basis as compared to applying correction factor on a daily basis as proposed in this study this may be due to the fact that the choice of an appropriate time scale of correction factor helps in reducing the discontinuities of daily rainfall caused due to sharp changes in bias correction factors between months chen et al 2013 has also reported that bias correction factors calculated on a monthly scale has a limited effect on properties when used for correction at the daily scale another drawback of using monthly time scale of correction factors is that weather extremes which can occur anytime over a month cannot be corrected effectively pierce et al 2015 hence adopting daily bias correction factors seem to provide good improvement in the correction of the rainfall data from climate models prior to their use in hydrologic models in addition to this long term mean monthly rainfall volume of all bias correction methods for all the six catchments was evaluated with those of imd gridded rainfall data the mean absolute error mae was used as an evaluation statistic from table 2 it is clear that the mae of dm method is consistently lower among all the bias correction methods irrespective of bias adjustment based on monthly or daily correction factors this indicates the superior performance of the dm method for bias correction further from table 2 it is very clear that irrespective of the bias correction methods except ls method and the climate zone of the basin the mae for the methods based on daily correction factor is considerably lower when compared to the mae for bias adjustment methods based on monthly correction factors the mae of the dm method based on daily correction factor is the lowest among all the methods for all the basins for the gfdl model the ls method based on monthly correction factor seems to have a lower mae better performance when compared to daily correction factors for all the river basins except achankovil however with the cnrm model the monthly correction factor of ls method seem to outperform the daily correction factor of ls method for only three basins this difference in the performance of ls methods applied with monthly correction factor versus daily correction factor could be due to the simple linear scaling that was also applied at the same monthly scale for correction same monthly time scale as the performance statistics so the mean monthly rainfall with monthly correction factor seemingly performs better than the daily correction factors with rainfall accumulated on a monthly scale while this apparent lacuna caused due to the mere adjustment of mean rainfall alone in the case of ls method is overcome to a greater extent by other bias correction methods especially dm method which clearly demonstrate the advantages of applying daily bias correction factors over monthly bias correction factors applied on a daily basis for better adjustment of rcm simulated rainfall 5 1 3 performance statistics of bias correction methods with daily correction factors for india statistical evaluation of bias correction methods was carried out for entire india using performance measure nse estimated for all the 365 days in a year for the entire dataset various bias correction methods and uncorrected data with reference to the imd gridded data the median nse value for each grid was plotted across india fig 7 to assess the performance of different bias correction methods fig 7 a indicates that the uncorrected rcm rainfall deviates significantly from observations over central and north eastern parts of india all the bias correction methods could improve the rcm simulated rainfall however there are significant differences in the level of reducing the bias the performance of the ls is poor with nse values below 0 4 for most of the north northwest and north east portions of india ls method adjusts only the mean values with respect to imd data while the loci method which corrects the mean wet day frequencies and intensities by the application of rainfall threshold prior to application of scaling could correct the rcm data reasonably well except for the some regions in north eastern and western india fig 7 c this could be due to the fact that loci method does not correct the variance of daily rainfall it is worthwhile to note from fig 7 d that the performance of pwtr method is poor in the north north western and south central portions of india which mostly come under semi arid climate zone except north region which is subjected to high variability in the wet day frequencies and intensities of rainfall this is mainly due to the fact that pwtr method which corrects only the mean and variance was not effective in correcting the bias in wet day frequencies and intensities this lacuna of pwtr method was overcome in this study by carrying out rainfall threshold prior to correction of variance and mean thereby removing the drizzle effect in the models in modified power transformation method mpwtr this greatly helped in improving the performance of corrected rainfall by mpwtr method although the mpwtr method obtained an acceptable nse value greater than 0 6 for most of india north western and north eastern parts of india which is subjected to very low and very high rainfall respectively has nse value below 0 4 fig 7 e this nonlinear transformation may not perform well for rcm simulations having a larger bias due to more number of highly uncertain extreme rainfall events the performance of dm method which matches the distribution functions of observations and rcm simulations was good over the entire country fig 7 f this method which corrects mean variance wet day frequencies and intensities by employing non linear transformation could obtain an nse greater than 0 81 across most climatic regions of india 5 2 evaluation of hydrological impact of bias correction the hydrological impact of bias correction of rainfall was evaluated by simulating the streamflow and comparing with the streamflow obtained using observed imd rainfall data the comparisons were made in terms of median monthly hydrographs flow duration curves and monthly streamflow quantiles 5 2 1 median monthly hydrograph the median monthly stream flows for the simulations with observed uncorrected and bias corrected data were estimated fig 8 shows the plots of the median monthly hydrographs for both cmip5 models in achankovil vaippar and birhidhang basin both the cmip5 models provided consistent assessments of the median monthly streamflows closer to imd simulated streamflow values for dm method in achankovil basin although the performance of mpwtr method as indicated by high nse values fig 8 a1 and a2 were comparable to the dm method the streamflow in achankovil was simulated better by using dm method for bias correcting the downscaled rainfall data while in vaippar fig 8 b1 and b2 all methods except ls and pwtr method simulated the streamflow closer to imd simulated streamflow values in birhidhang basin fig 8 c1 and c2 both ls and pwtr methods under estimated the streamflows during the south west monsoon season loci mpwtr and dm method performed reasonably well in ken subarnarekha and sabarmathi basins fig 9 as indicated by the fig 9 ls and pwtr method underestimated the streamflow in both ken and subarnarekha basin while in sabarmathi basin ls and pwtr methods over estimated the streamflows in catchments located in arid semi arid climate zones sabarmathi and vaippar ls and pwtr methods consistently over estimated the streamflow it was observed earlier that in the vaippar basin there was an overestimation in the number of rainy days with a reasonable estimation of rainfall volume fig 2 b and sabarmathi basin exhibited underestimation of the rainfall volume with a reasonable estimation of rainy days fig 3 f this could have resulted in the poor performance of ls and pwtr methods in these two basins ls and pwtr method which fails to correct the number of rainy days is not suitable for semi arid catchments with large variability in rcm simulated rainfall fang et al 2015 has also reported that ls method is not ideal for hydrological impact assessments if there is a large variation between observed and rcm simulated rainfall distribution due to its inability in adjusting the statistical properties of rainfall other than its mean from the figs 8 and 9 it could be observed that the median hydrographs estimated with rcm rainfall bias corrected with dm method compared closely with the median hydrographs simulated with imd gridded rainfall data this clearly demonstrates the superior performance of dm method in bias correction further the difference in the magnitude of hydrographs for different bias correction method shows that the choice of bias correction method will have a greater effect on the hydrologic simulations 5 2 2 flow duration curve the effect of bias correction of rainfall data on the simulation of streamflow was further evaluated using monthly flow duration curves to assess the efficacy in simulating different ranges of streamflow and its probability of occurrence the flow duration curves with monthly average streamflows simulated using imd uncorrected and bias corrected rainfall were plotted for all the six catchments fig 10 from fig 10 it can be generally observed that in all the six river basins the streamflow simulated using rainfall data bias corrected with dm method followed closely the flow distribution simulated using imd gridded rainfall data further the flow distribution simulated using rainfall data bias corrected with ls and pwtr are not able to replicate the streamflow distribution in achankovil basin which is located in a tropical wet climate except for the streamflow distribution simulated with ls method all other methods of rainfall bias correction are able to replicate the streamflow distribution comparable to those simulated with imd gridded rainfall data fig 10 a1 and a2 the overestimation of streamflow by ls method could be due to the overestimation in the number of rainy days by the rcm fig 2 a which was not adjusted wet day frequencies during the bias correction for this method in vaippar and sabarmathi basins which are located in semi arid and arid climates respectively the streamflow distribution simulated using loci mpwtr and dm method are able to replicate streamflows very similar to those obtained from imd gridded data however the streamflow distribution with rainfall corrected by ls and pwtr methods have a tendency to overestimate the streamflows this overestimation of streamflow by ls and pwtr method could be due to the inaccurate simulation in the number of rainy days by the rcm fig 2 b and f which was not adjusted in terms of wet day frequencies during the bias correction using these methods stream flow distribution simulated with rainfall corrected by ls and pwtr methods have a tendency to underestimate the streamflow in humid subtropical and tropical climate as indicated for birhidhang ken and subarnarekha basins fig 10 c1 and c2 d1 and d2 e1 and e2 this underestimation could be due to the difference in wet day frequencies which is not adjusted by the ls and pwtr methods hence the small rainfall quantities is distributed across more number of days resulting in the underestimation of the streamflows however the streamflow distribution simulated with rainfall corrected by loci mpwtr and dm method very closely followed the simulation with observed rainfall data primarily because the wet day frequencies are adjusted in all these three bias correction methods due to the adjustment of wet day frequencies the antecedent moisture in the model is realistically simulated resulting in a better simulation of streamflow distribution comparable to those simulated with observed rainfall data 5 2 3 performance statistics for streamflow quantiles the evaluation of flow duration curve gives an assessment of overall flow distribution within the period of analysis however this does not give information about the distribution of streamflow for individual months over the period of analysis the ability of different rainfall bias correction methods in the simulation of streamflow distribution for individual months in comparison to simulations with imd gridded data was evaluated using nse the performance statistics nse for various quantiles 5 10 90 95 of streamflow values for each of the twelve months for uncorrected and bias corrected rainfall compared to streamflow simulated using imd rainfall values were evaluated for cmip5 models for all six catchments fig 11 depicts the mosaic plots of nse values as a measure of different quantiles of streamflow values for each month over the 30 year simulation period for achankovil and vaippar basin located on the windward and leeward sides of western ghats respectively the performance of the most of the bias correction methods is poor during the months of jan mar dry season with high variability in nse values these basins experiences winter and pre monsoon rainfall due to western disturbances driven by westerlies in the southern portion of india guhathakurta and rajeevan 2008 one plausible interpretation is that due to highly uncertain nature and small amount of rainfall these disturbances are not adequately simulated by the cmip5 models figs 3 a and 2 b the high nse values nse 0 6 during the other months indicate that the bias correction of rainfall by loci and dm methods were able to replicate the distribution of streamflow in each of monsoon months as observed with simulations using imd gridded data in birhidhang basin located in humid subtropical climate with no dry season the performance of most of the bias correction methods are reasonably good for majority of the months this may be due to the reasonable performance of rcm in simulating both the rainy days and rainfall volume over a year figs 2 c and 3 c however dm method outperformed other methods which is very clear from fig 10 in ken subarnarekha and sabarmathi basins the performance of loci mpwtr and dm methods are good compared to other methods with high nse values for the south west monsoon period despite underestimation of rainfall by the rcm in these basin as observed earlier fig 3 d f this is due to the adjustments in the wet day frequencies and intensities incorporated in these bias correction methods in all the basins the bias correction methods where the wet day frequencies are adjusted viz loci mpwtr and dm are able to reasonably replicate the streamflow distribution during the peak monsoon season however the performance of loci and mpwtr are poor during the dry season in contrast even during the dry season performance of dm method was much superior over other methods in replicating the streamflow distribution of each month further the difference in the nse values for different bias correction method shows that the choice of bias correction method will have significant effect on the hydrologic simulations 6 summary and conclusions the work presented in this paper contributes towards development and validation of a new methodology for bias correction of rcm simulated rainfall on a daily basis using a sliding window approach the two best performing cmip5 models for indian summer monsoon cnrm cm5 0 and gfdl cm3 0 downscaled using ccam are found to have less inter model variability although both the models capture very well the indian summer monsoon south west monsoon there are errors in simulating the peak monsoon month both the models simulate the peak monsoon rainfall month one or two months earlier than the observed peaks further in southern parts of india the retreating monsoon is a major reason for rainfall observed during the months of october to december however the rainfall during these retreating monsoon months rainy days and rainfall magnitude is not well simulated by the downscaled models this bias in the rainfall data was corrected using the new methodology proposed in this study this work compared the abilities of five rainfall bias correction methods namely linear scaling ls local intensity scaling loci power transformation pwtr modified power transformation mpwtr and distribution mapping dm in correcting rcm simulations for entire india with daily correction factors the q q plots clearly demonstrated that the bias correction with daily factors was much superior when compared to methods based on monthly correction factors the median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse based on the q q plots over the 365 days across india depicted that the dm method was able to bias correct the rcm rainfall data more reliably irrespective of the seasons or climate zones assessment of streamflow in terms of monthly median hydrographs flow duration curves and monthly flow distributions clearly demonstrate that the bias correction methods have considerable impact in the simulation of streamflow the bias correction methods which account for wet day frequency adjustments are able to replicate the streamflow reasonably well nse 0 6 especially the loci mpwtr and dm method of bias correction of rainfall was able to replicate the monthly streamflow during the monsoon months however the dm method of bias correction of rainfall was able to replicate the monthly streamflow distribution even during the dry months with less number of rainy days this clearly shows that the dm method based on daily correction factors of rcm rainfall would be a suitable method irrespective of seasons or climate zone for a realistic simulation of hydrologic impacts of climate change the main advantage of the proposed new methodology is the ability to preserve the daily characteristics of the rainfall this method of bias correction based on daily factors enables a smooth transition of daily correction factors thus can be considered more appropriate than a sharp transition which occurs in monthly correction factors when applied on a daily time scale furthermore in the proposed sliding window approach seasonal cycle of the climatology in a region can be replicated well thereby avoiding climatological discontinuities that occur at the transition between months as in traditional methods hence the proposed method appears to be versatile and can be applied to other regional climatic zones across monsoon influenced countries it can also be concluded from this study that the dm method is the best daily precipitation bias correction technique further this study also emphasizes the importance of the selection of appropriate bias correction method and applying them on a daily time scale for watersheds to make realistic hydrological assessments although this study demonstrated that the general distribution patterns of the stream flow are well replicated by the proposed bias correction method it did not focus on the effectiveness of the bias correction technique in replicating the hydrological extremes hence the future scope of work could assess the effectiveness of the bias correction data in terms of replicating low flow indices and high flow indices this would help to improve the reliability of climate change impact assessment on different flow regimes that delivers different ecosystem services acknowledgement we would like to acknowledge cccr iitm and imd india for providing the data to perform this study 
7544,regional climate models rcms are used to downscale the coarse resolution general circulation model gcm outputs to a finer resolution for hydrological impact studies however rcm outputs often deviate from the observed climatological data and therefore need bias correction before they are used for hydrological simulations while there are a number of methods for bias correction most of them use monthly statistics to derive correction factors which may cause errors in the rainfall magnitude when applied on a daily scale this study proposes a sliding window based daily correction factor derivations that help build reliable daily rainfall data from climate models the procedure is applied to five existing bias correction methods and is tested on six watersheds in different climatic zones of india for assessing the effectiveness of the corrected rainfall and the consequent hydrological simulations the bias correction was performed on rainfall data downscaled using conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam to 0 5 0 5 from two different cmip5 models cnrm cm5 0 gfdl cm3 0 the india meteorological department imd gridded 0 25 0 25 observed rainfall data was considered to test the effectiveness of the proposed bias correction method the quantile quantile q q plots and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were employed for evaluation of different methods of bias correction the analysis suggested that the proposed method effectively corrects the daily bias in rainfall as compared to using monthly factors the methods such as local intensity scaling modified power transformation and distribution mapping which adjusted the wet day frequencies performed superior compared to the other methods which did not consider adjustment of wet day frequencies the distribution mapping method with daily correction factors was able to replicate the daily rainfall pattern of observed data with nse value above 0 81 over most parts of india hydrological simulations forced using the bias corrected rainfall distribution mapping and modified power transformation methods that used the proposed daily correction factors was similar to those simulated by the imd rainfall the results demonstrate that the methods and the time scales used for bias correction of rcm rainfall data have a larger impact on the accuracy of the daily rainfall and consequently the simulated streamflow the analysis suggests that the distribution mapping with daily correction factors can be preferred for adjusting rcm rainfall data irrespective of seasons or climate zones for realistic simulation of streamflow keywords hydrological modelling rcm bias correction distribution mapping swat 1 introduction global warming is likely to exert considerable impact on the hydrological cycle everett et al 1996 that subsequently influence water resources general circulation models gcms are widely used to assess the impacts of global warming on time mean changes in climate and subsequently on the hydrologic cycle it is well recognized that these gcms realistically capture large scale circulation patterns and demonstrate high skill in simulating variables which have high degree of spatial uniformity such as surface pressure wind speed or temperature the horizontal resolutions at which gcms operate 100 200 km has obvious limitations in resolving and representing small scale features that impact rainfall characteristics and hence moisture related variables from these coarse resolution gcms cannot be used directly for hydrological water resources impact modelling studies in meso local scales hansen et al 2006 sharma et al 2007 chen et al 2011 salvi et al 2013 downscaling techniques have been developed to derive regional information about climate variables from coarse resolution gcm outputs themeßl et al 2011 these techniques take into account regional forcings such as orography lakes and land surface characteristics which influence the local climate murphy 1999 there are two approaches to downscale gcm simulations viz statistical and dynamical downscaling the statistical downscaling sd approach establishes empirical relationship between large scale climate patterns and local climate variables and incorporate these relationships to gcm outputs to derive regional information fowler et al 2007 in dynamical downscaling dd approach a high resolution regional climate model rcm is nested with gcm outputs to derive physically consistent regional weather and climate parameters with sufficient details sd and dd methods both have their strengths and shortcomings sd methods are more easy to implement and computationally efficient hewitson and crane 1996 however it is based on the assumption that statistical relationship between large and local scale processes remains stationary in future climate time period this assumption is perhaps not true given the non linear and non stationary nature of the evolving climate furthermore to apply sd needs sufficiently long term observed data to derive robust statistical relationships for regions of interest there are several approaches that have been developed over the years to overcome these limitations of sd methods hessami et al 2008 jeong et al 2012 khalili et al 2013 ben alaya et al 2015 bhowmik et al 2017 dd method on the other hand is complex and difficult to implement dd uses high resolution rcm model forced with gcm simulated state variables at its lateral boundary along with surface boundary conditions and hence provides finer resolution climate variables christensen et al 2001 king et al 2012 dd is considered to be very effective in physically characterizing the spatial distribution of climate trends through process based modelling of the atmospheric system thus improving simulation of non stationarity in the climate dynamics dell aquila et al 2012 and could improve the inter annual variability simulated by the gcm by realistically capturing the role of local feedbacks guyennon et al 2013 hence dd method is more useful for hydrological model impact studies however rcms are subjected to bias introduced by the systematic errors in the driving gcm variables along with its own biases due to model formulation paimazumder and done 2015 in order to obtain reliable climate simulations the biases are adjusted using different techniques christensen et al 2008 typically on a monthly scale which can be used further for hydrological impact studies as the study of current climate hydrology relationships forms the foundation step for future climate change simulations and its effect on water resource management more reliable and accurate estimates of climate variables become vital this study aims at providing realistic estimates of rainfall simulations from climate models at daily time scale by proposing a new methodology for bias correction of rcm derived rainfall data which is useful for hydrological modelling studies in the context of climate change 2 review of literature the reliability of the rcm output and its further use for hydrologic impact studies are highly dependent on the chosen region of study chen et al 2013 in a chosen region simulation of rcm rainfall is influenced by regional features such as topography land cover land use salvi et al 2013 and non linear interactions between large scale dynamical and local thermodynamic processes rainfall being a highly complex variable modelling its behaviour at daily time scales and further at meso local scales 10 50 km pose yet another challenge to climate modellers this challenge is amplified further due to lack of direct observations to constrain and improve model physics the realistic representation of daily rainfall from climate models play a decisive role in the impact assessment studies and to assure meaningful runoff simulations from hydrological models bias correction of climate model outputs is essential wood et al 2004 eden et al 2012 salvi et al 2013 chen et al 2013 further in most of the catchments main factor contributing towards runoff is rainfall hence the selection of a particular bias correction method is more pronounced in the case of rainfall haerter et al 2011 chen et al 2013 in this regard several bias correction methods have been developed with varying level of complexities to correct the rcm simulations these include correcting the mean to more advanced methods such as correction of both mean and variance with further advancement in adjusting the quantile values sunyer et al 2014 linear scaling and local intensity scaling are mean based approaches in which the former correct the monthly means while the latter correct the wet day frequencies and intensities along with the monthly mean chen et al 2013 power transformation method adjusts the mean and variance of rainfall data leander et al 2008 but not the wet day frequencies and intensities distribution mapping or quantile mapping is a distribution based approach which corrects the mean and variance together with wet day frequencies and intensities teutschbein and seibert 2012 li et al 2010 developed a new method for bias correction called equidistance quantile matching method based on mixed gamma distribution that accounts for the distribution changes between the baseline and future time periods though the results indicated that this method was skilful to incorporate the changed variability and was superior to quantile based mapping method but was applied for monthly rainfall from gcms piani et al 2010 validated a statistical bias correction method based on distribution mapping method with gamma distribution and the performance was good for seasonal means heavy rainfall events and seasonal drought index but not for the daily rainfall events lafon et al 2012 compared the performance of linear non linear gamma based quantile mapping and empirical distribution based quantile mapping methods and found out that mean and standard deviation of daily rainfall can be effectively corrected while the correction of skewness and kurtosis of daily rainfall are sensitive to the choice of bias correction method and calibration period although gamma based quantile mapping method provides better results where the variability in rainfall was captured by gamma distribution the study employed monthly gamma parameters to correct the daily rainfall data the performance of distribution derived parametric and nonparametric transformations were compared by gudmundsson et al 2012 and identified that nonparametric transformations possess good proficiency in the reduction of biases in rainfall simulated by rcms while assessing hydrological response to climate change teutschbein and seibert 2012 reported that all bias correction methods improved rcm outputs rainfall and temperature and distribution mapping method was found to be superior for hydrological simulation but the corrections employed monthly factors a histogram equalization bias correction method was applied by argüeso et al 2013 that could considerably reduce the seasonal and daily biases of rainfall even in areas where the rainfall is over estimated and in areas where the wet day conditions are not met as the driving mechanism of rainfall varies throughout the year the bias correction was applied on a seasonal basis and the gamma parameters were estimated for each season separately fang et al 2015 reported that power transformation and quantile mapping method performed better in correcting standard deviation and percentile values but employed monthly correction factors at daily time scale to correct the temporal scale biases maurer et al 2010 applied bias correction on a daily basis using the daily average precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures for a particular month while some studies have employed quantile mapping method at daily timescale using a 31 day moving window approach themeß1 et al 2011 thrasher et al 2012 wilcke et al 2013 further advancements in the area of bias correction with multiple scales and nested approaches at daily scale has been attempted mehrotra and sharma 2012 mehrotra and sharma 2015 another advancement was seen in the deployment of multiple timescales with a three tier cascade bias correction method proposed by haerter et al 2011 which can operate on different timescales separately which could reproduce the statistics of the observed data at various timescales johnson and sharma 2012 developed a nested bias correction approach based on the assumption of a linear autoregressive model that could correct the mean standard deviation and lag 1 autocorrelations of gcm simulations at the monthly and annual time scales which performed well when the biases are not too large mehrotra and sharma 2012 proposed a recursive nested bias correction approach which is an extension of the nested bias correction which includes five specified time scales and more than three iterations to improve the bias corrected results and was found to be more effective in correcting distribution and persistence attributes at various time scales mehrotra and sharma 2015 developed multivariate recursive nesting bias correction approach which simultaneously corrects multiple climate variables at different levels of temporal aggregation to replicate distributional and persistence properties of observed data at multiple time scales to achieve good results across all variables and time scales considered a further modification of this method known as multivariate recursive quantile nesting bias correction was proposed by mehrotra and sharma 2016 which focused at the correction of lag 1 dependence and cross dependence attributes across multiple time scales and found that the representation of variability and persistence related attributes good nguyen et al 2016 presented a frequency based bias correction method which employs fourier transform and is independent of the choice of timescale for gcm based monthly precipitation and found that the performance was good for first and second moment statistics and persistence based attributes at multiple time scales recently much thrust has been given to bivariate distribution of rainfall and temperature for correcting their joint distribution which could reduce the biases not only in the mean and variance but also in the correlation between the two variables li et al 2014 a multivariate empirical copula bias correction ec bc proposed by vrac and friederichs 2015 combines one dimensional bias correction and reshuffling of multivariate spatiotemporal data based on the rank structure derived from training data to obtain realistic inter variable spatial and temporal dependencies but makes stationarity assumption which could only replicate patterns derived from historical series a bias correction method which combines principal components and quantile mapping was attempted by hnilica et al 2017 which takes into account correction of multivariate data sets and could substantially reduce the bias in the distribution of individual variables covariance and correlation structures of daily precipitation but spatial dependence structure of daily precipitation was only corrected and the dependence between climate variables was not attempted cannon 2016 developed a multivariate bias correction mbc algorithm which is a multidimensional analog of univariate quantile mapping method and corrects the dependence structure of pearson correlation and spearman rank correlation to match the observed distribution the performance of mbc was much convincing compared to the univariate quantile mapping method but was applied on monthly time series a further improvisation of multivariate bias correction method was adapted cannon 2017 by implementing n dimensional probability density function transform algorithm mbcn which could transfer all characteristics of observed multivariate distribution to the corresponding multivariate distribution of climate projections though the results were closely matching with the observed data for spatio temporal autocorrelation of rainfall data the method possess high computational complexities however dosio and paruolo 2011 reported that univariate bias correction methods have prominence over multivariate methods when a good measure of dependence among climatic variables are accounted for moreover rarely multivariate approach aims at conserving the dependence between more than two variable hempel et al 2013 even though immense progress has been achieved in recent years in the development and assessment of bias correction methods temporal variation of rainfall was accounted only in few studies while correcting the daily rcm rainfall many of the existing bias correction methods which are performed on a monthly basis by grouping data into months or seasons often result in masking the characteristics of daily rainfall kim et al 2015 the day to day variability in the rainfall characteristics are mainly caused by the magnitude of diurnal cycle and local weather synoptic system haerter et al 2011 hence when a bias correction is performed based on correction factors estimated month seasonal basis and applied on a daily timescale the variations of daily rainfall cannot be accurately incorporated due to sharp transition in the bias correction factors between one month season and another month season this sharp transition in bias correction factor can distort the daily characteristics of rainfall moreover for climate change impact studies most of the hydrological models require good quality rainfall data at daily time scale for obtaining realistic flow simulations hence an improved bias correction method which accounts for variability of rainfall at daily time scale is vital for use in climate change studies and has been focused in the present study therefore in this study we propose a method to account for the temporal variability in daily rainfall by performing bias correction of daily rainfall with daily correction factors using a sliding window technique the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated for different climatic zones across india and is shown to perform better than those methods that depend on monthly correction factors further the impact of proposed method on hydrologic simulation of river discharges using soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is evaluated for six catchments in india each located in different climatic zones 3 study area and climate datasets the study area fig 1 consists of six catchments achankovil vaippar birhidhang ken subarnarekha and sabarmathi river basins of india each representing different regional climate and the details of which are given in table 1 specifically these regions were chosen based on the timing amount and monsoonal characteristics south west or north east of rainfall i achankovil river located in the state of kerala originates from the western ghat mountain range in the southern peninsula the basin receives rainfall during both south west summer monsoon june to september as well as north east retreating monsoon october to december ii vaippar river also originates from the western ghat mountain range but on the leeward side rain shadow region located in the state of tamil nadu the rainfall in the basin is characterized by north east monsoon accounting for the majority of the rainfall iii birhidhang river which is an important south bank tributary of brahmaputra river flows through the states of assam and arunachal pradesh the basin receives heavy monsoonal rain during south west monsoon however the basin also receives intermittent thundershowers during the dry seasons of march to may the basin experiences cold humid winter with shorter summer iv ken river originates from north west slopes of kaimur hills flows through the states of uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh before joining river yamuna the basin which is fed mostly by the south west monsoon 90 of annual rainfall is situated in subtropical humid climatic zone of india and experiences dry winter and very dry summer v subarnarekha river originates from chotanagpur plateau flows through the states of jharkhand west bengal and odissa before its confluence with bay of bengal the basin is mostly influenced by the south west monsoon and receives 90 of rainfall during june october the basin experiences a humid sub tropical climate with hot summer and mild winters vi sabarmathi river originates from aravalli hills of rajasthan the basin is located in the hot arid regions of western india and experiences hot summer with temperature ranges of 42 c 45 c and moderate winter the basin receives its 95 of the annual rainfall during the monsoon months of june september the river flows through states of rajasthan and gujarat before draining into gulf of cambay of arabian sea this study uses a high resolution 0 25 x 0 25 gridded daily rainfall data obtained from india meteorological department imd for the period 1901 2013 pai et al 2014 as temperature data at the same resolution was not available gridded daily temperature data at the resolution of 1 1 latitude longitude developed by imd for the period 1969 2005 was used srivastava et al 2009 the two best performing gcms for the indian subcontinent were selected for this study based on the model evaluation works by sperber et al 2012 sengupta and rajeevan 2013 and hasson et al 2014 sperber et al 2012 assessed the performance of cmip3 and cmip5 models in simulating the asian summer monsoon based on statistical metrics the study concluded that gcms fidelity in simulating the indian monsoon is still low however they identified that cnrm cm5 0 and gfdl cm3 0 models realistically simulate the june september summer rainfall climatology over the indian monsoon region the current study thus adopts cnrm cm5 0 and gfdl cm3 0 models of cmip5 versions the data from these two gcms downscaled to 0 5 0 5 using the rcm conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam for the reference period 1970 2005 was obtained from coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex for south asia from the centre for climate change research cccr indian institute of tropical meteorology http cccr tropmet res in cordex for this study the downscaled rcm rainfall data was used for the evaluation of various bias correction methods the current study used 90 m digital elevation model dem from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm for delineating the watershed the land cover data developed by national remote sensing centre nrsc india from awifs sensor at 56 m resolution was used the soil map used for hydrologic modelling was harmonized world soil database v 1 2 nachtergaele et al 2008 obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations 4 methodology the existing approaches used for bias correction of rainfall data aims at correcting bias in rcm simulations by employing a transformation algorithm to correct daily values based on statistics and data pooled for each month instead in this study we are proposing to apply these transformation algorithms for correcting daily rainfall values based on statistics from data pooled for a 31 day sliding window the basic principle involved in the estimation of daily correction factors is to employ a sliding window approach for each of the 365 days in a year over the available number of years of observed rainfall data in order to choose a minimum of 100 rainy day values so as to ensure a good number of data points for obtaining probability distribution plots for this window sizes ranging from 10 to 40 days around each of the 365 days in a year were tested and it was observed that a minimum window size of 31 days centred around each day of the year was acceptable in obtaining a set of at least 100 rainy days from the 30 year record during dry months across different study areas these selected rainy day values were further used in the various bias correction methods to estimate the daily correction factors which were used for corrections of rcm simulations for this rainfall data from rcm grids were bias corrected with respect to that of the nearest imd gridded rainfall data the bias correction methods based on both daily and monthly correction factors are evaluated based on nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse and quantile quantile q q plots with respect to imd data prior to bias correction the extent to which various rcms capture the regional distribution of the monsoon and rainfall pattern was analysed based on the frequency and magnitude of rainfall the data obtained from imd was used as observed data to assess the fidelity of the rcms in reproducing rainfall characteristics of current climate as the comparison of number of rainy days and rainfall volume provides a simple and effective way to assess the performance of cmip5 models with observed data it was used to assess the effectiveness of the selected models in representing the climate of the study area the effect of bias correction methods on hydrological model simulations are studied based on long term median hydrographs flow duration curves and streamflow quantiles for six catchments with different climatology using two cmip5 models gfdl and cnrm the estimation of different correction factors for different bias correction methods and their performance were all evaluated for the same time period 1974 2005 4 1 bias correction methods in this study five bias correction methods based on daily correction factors have been tested including a modification proposed to the power transformation method the details of the methods are explained in the following sections 4 1 1 linear scaling ls of rainfall lenderink et al 2007 proposed linear scaling approach of bias correction based on monthly correction values the rainfall is corrected with a multiplicative ratio of observed monthly mean to the uncorrected data rcm data for the baseline historic run in this study the correction is based on multiplier term on a daily basis using a 31 day sliding window 1 p cor d p rcm d μ p obs d μ p rcm d where p cor d and p rcm d are corrected and uncorrected rainfall respectively on day d and μ represents the expected value for the 31 day sliding window for the day d 4 1 2 local intensity scaling loci of rainfall many a time the climate models gcm rcm rain frequently drizzle effect albeit in small quantities which may skew the statistics used for bias correction hence schmidli et al 2006 presented local intensity scaling which could adjust the mean as well as both wet day frequencies and wet day intensities of rainfall time series threshold rainfall p th d is fixed such that the number of rainy days above 2 4 mm definition of a light rainy day as per india meteorological department in the observed and the simulated records are of similar length over a 30 year period further rcm rainfall is corrected by redefining days with rainfall less than p th d as dry days with no rainfall and for rainfall more than p th d the threshold value is subtracted from the rcm rainfall the linear scaling factor s d is estimated by the following ratio 2 s d μ p obs d p obs d 0 μ p rcm d p rcm d p th d p th d the correction factor thus derived is applied to the rainfall data as given in eq 3 3 p cor d 0 if p rcm d p th d p rcm d p th d s d otherwise in this study a slight modification of existing loci method was applied which includes rainfall thresholding prior to multiplying linear scaling factor s d and p th d was calculated on a daily basis for a 31 day sliding window this could remove most of the very light rainy days 4 1 3 power transformation pwtr of rainfall the power transformation method uses an exponential form apb to adjust the variance of rainfall series leander and buishand 2007 leander et al 2008 the parameter b is calculated on a daily basis for a 31 day sliding window by matching the co efficient of variation of observed and rcm daily rainfall series the exponential term b for each day is estimated which minimizes the function 4 f b d σ p obs d μ p obs d σ p rcm d b d μ p rcm d b d where b d is the exponent for the dth day σ represents the standard deviation and μ represents the mean of the rainfall p obs d and p rcm d indicates the observed rainfall and uncorrected rcm rainfall for the baseline scenario for the day d following which an intermediary corrected rainfall p rcm d is estimated thereafter the scaling parameter s d which is the ratio of observed mean and mean of the intermediary corrected rainfall is calculated the final corrected rainfall series p cor is obtained by multiplying the intermediary corrected rainfall with the scaling parameter 5 p rcm d p rcm d b d 6 s d μ p obs d μ p rcm d 7 p cor p rcm d s d 4 1 4 modified power transformation mpwtr of rainfall the power transformation method does not correct the biases in the wet day frequencies and intensities teutschbein and seibert 2012 caused by the drizzle effect of the models hence we tested a hybrid method of combining rainfall thresholding similar to loci prior to applying correction by power transformation method at first rainfall threshold was calculated for the rcm rainfall data as explained in loci method section 4 1 2 so that the wet day frequencies are similar in rcm as those in imd thereafter rcm rainfall was corrected by redefining days with rainfall less than p th d as dry days with no rainfall and for rainfall more than p th d the rcm rainfall was shifted by p th d the equations employed for modified power transformation are given as in eqs 8 11 8 f b d σ p obs d μ p obs d σ p rcm d p th d b d μ p rcm d p th d b d 9 p rcm d p rcm d p th d b d 10 s d μ p obs d μ p rcm d 11 p cor p rcm d s d 4 1 5 distribution mapping dm of rainfall the distribution mapping method corrects the distribution function of rcm simulated rainfall in such a manner that it agrees with the distribution function of observed time series quantile quantile mapping or q q mapping the shifting of distributions to correct the rcm simulations with respect to observed rainfall can be achieved with the help of a transfer function sennikovs and bethers 2009 for each site various probability distributions such as gamma gumbel weibul normal and lognormal were applied to the rainfall series and were tested for the goodness of fit using kolmogorov smirnov k s test in the present study gamma distribution was found to be the best fitting distribution for rainfall data from different climate and for different seasons throughout the year gamma distribution function was constructed for rcm simulated rainfall values with shape parameter α and scale parameter β as given in eq 12 12 f x α β x α 1 1 β α e x β x 0 α β 0 as the higher number of rainy days in the simulated record due to the drizzle effect could skew the fitted distribution rainfall thresholding as explained in section 4 1 2 was subtracted from the rcm rainfall so as to remove the days with very low rainfall the shape and scale parameters for all the 365 days were found out for the observed and rcm simulated rainfall on a daily basis using a 31 day sliding window centred on day d the inverse of gamma distribution function was found out for these gamma cumulative distribution function values with the corresponding day s shape and scale parameter of observed values this value is taken as the corrected rcm rainfall for the current climate condition this procedure of q q mapping can be expressed mathematically as 13 p cor d f γ 1 f γ p rcm d α rcm d β rcm d α obs d β obs d 4 2 impact of bias correction on hydrologic model simulation of river discharges the uncertainties introduced by the climate and hydrological models combined with the natural climate variability muerth et al 2013 affects the amount of simulated streamflow from the catchment in this study to illustrate the effect of various bias correction methods on the hydrologic response of a catchment the hydrological model swat was employed the swat model parameters were not calibrated as the intention was to understand the effect of different bias correction methods of rainfall on the hydrologic response of the catchment while keeping the swat model parameters the same between simulations so the only difference among the simulations of a river basin is the rainfall data from different bias correction methods the rainfall and temperature data of the selected downscaled gcms were directly used to run the swat model without any bias correction and then with the various bias corrected rainfall data this was then compared with swat simulations with imd gridded weather data observed this helps in assessing whether the bias correction methods applied to downscaled rainfall data when used for hydrological modelling are able to simulate streamflows comparable to those simulated using imd gridded rainfall data swat model simulations were performed for the time period from 1970 to 2005 with a model warm up period of four years hence only the streamflow simulations from 1974 to 2005 was used for further analysis the proposed methodology was applied on six river basins located on different climate zones within india the effect of bias correction methods on hydrological model simulations were studied based on comparing long term median monthly hydrographs and flow duration curves simulated using bias corrected rainfall data compared to those obtained using simulations with imd gridded weather data 5 results and discussions the temporal characteristics of observed and simulated number of rainy days and rainfall magnitude above 2 4 mm definition of a light rainy day as per india meteorological department during each month long term monthly average before bias correction were compared to assess the performance of selected gcms in six basins falling in different climatic zones fig 2 the results of average number of rainy days and rainfall amounts for uncorrected rcm data are presented for one representative rcm grid 0 5 0 5 for each basin analysis of the total number of rainy days simulated in a year over a 30 year simulation period by both cnrm cm5 0 and gfdl cm3 0 compares reasonably well with average number of rainy days from imd gridded data for all catchments except vaippar basin which is located in the semi arid zone rain shadow region however there are considerable differences in the average number of rainy days simulated in all the basins on a monthly basis fig 2 including the month with highest number of rainy days the inter model variability between the two best performing climate models is very minimal figs 2 and 3 as mentioned earlier the achankovil basin which is on the windward side of the western ghats experiences two rainfall seasons south west monsoon and north east monsoon fig 2 a however the gcms seem to simulate primarily the south west monsoon which is a major rainfall season for much of the indian sub continent the north east or retreating monsoon caused due to high pressure because of the cooling of landmass over the himalayas and the indo gangetic plain after the autumnal equinox september this brings air mass laden with moisture from bay of bengal and northern indian ocean resulting in substantial rainfall in several parts of southern peninsula kerala and tamil nadu even the best performing gcms selected for this region do not seem to capture the spatial and temporal aspect of this retreating monsoon this could be observed even in the simulation of rainy days for vaippar basin on the leeward side of the western ghats east of achankovil basin which dominantly receives rainfall only during the north east monsoon fig 2 b however both the gcms simulate higher rainy days in vaippar basin even during the south west monsoon 2 3 times higher than observed number of rainy days perhaps due to the problem of drizzle effect in the models in this region in terms of average monthly rainfall magnitude for achankovil basin both the gcms seem to reasonably capture the magnitude of south west monsoon rainfall but not the north east monsoon fig 3 a for vaippar basin even though the number of rainy days in the north east monsoon was over estimated by the gcms the total rainfall magnitude was simulated well with an overestimation of rainfall magnitude during the south west monsoon fig 3 b birhidhang basin is located in the north east corner of india in humid subtropical climate without any dry season the dominant rainy season is the south west monsoon with peak rainy days and rainfall quantities during the month of july figs 2 c and 3 c compared to observations though the rainy days and rainfall quantities are reasonably simulated by the climate models the simulated peak monsoon season is ahead by two months which clearly indicates the lacuna of even the best climate models in capturing the regional processes ken basin located in central india originating in the kaimur hills with humid subtropical climate experiences peak monsoon season during the month of july the climate models seem to simulate the rainy days reasonably well but with a one month shift advance in the peak monsoonal occurrence figs 2 d and 3 d however the rainfall magnitudes were highly underestimated by both the best performing climate models this again indicates the lacuna of the existing climate models subarnarekha basin is located in eastern india and experiences a tropical wet and dry climate the dominant rainy season is the south west monsoon with peak rainy days and rainfall quantities during the month of july figs 2 e and 3 e although the rainy days are reasonably simulated by the climate models the models simulate the peak monsoon season two months ahead of the actual monsoon peak similar to birhidhang basin which clearly indicates the lacuna of even the best climate models in capturing the indian summer monsoon the climate models also underestimate the rainfall magnitude by as much as 50 of the observed rainfall over the 30 year record sabarmathi basin is located in western india and experiences an arid climate with a dominant rainy season of south west monsoon with peak rainy days and rainfall quantities during the month of july figs 2 f and 3 f the rainy days are reasonably simulated by the climate models however the models clearly underestimate the rainfall quantities by as much as 60 of observed rainfall in summary the climate models tend to capture the peak rainfall during the south west monsoon season earlier by as much as one to two months although the number of rainy days simulated in the regions dominated by the south west monsoon is comparable to the observed data the models seem to underestimate the rainfall magnitudes by as much as 50 in many cases except in the north east portion birhidhang basin where there is a slight over estimation of rainfall further in the regions experiencing north east monsoon retreating monsoon in the southern peninsula the models exhibit extreme drizzle effect this is apparent in the vaippar basin where the number of rainy days simulated by the models is as much as two to three times higher than the observations while the rainfall magnitudes are comparable at the moment this lacuna exhibited by the climate models can only be rectified by bias correction techniques while the science of climate modelling is progressing to improve the model representations 5 1 performance evaluation of bias correction methods 5 1 1 q q plots of bias correction methods with daily correction factors q q plots provide useful comparison of the response of rainfall distribution across various bias corrected rainfall values in order to compare the overall performance of each bias correction method based on daily correction factors we first evaluated the quantiles of observed uncorrected and bias corrected rcm simulations for a chosen day for both the cmip5 models for selected grids of all six catchments this was done to evaluate whether the daily distribution of observed rainfall could be replicated by this new bias adjustment methodology based on daily correction factors as a demonstration of this q q plot of cmip5 cnrm cm5 0 gfdl cm3 0 models for achankovil basin on the 160th day 31 day window centred on 160th day during the peak of south west monsoon is shown in fig 4 as indicated by the fig 4 a and b all the bias correction methods based on daily correction factors consistently show improved performance for both the cmip5 models in achankovil basin with high nse values above 0 9 fig 4 a and b indicates that the performance of distribution mapping dm modified power transformation mpwtr and local intensity scaling loci methods closely followed the imd values observed rainfall for gfdl cm3 0 in achankovil basin pwtr method underestimated the high rainfall values for gfdl cm3 0 model while for cnrm cm5 0 model all the bias correction methods followed the imd values with dm method performance better than the others the same procedure was repeated for other catchments also and it was observed that in all the six basins daily based bias correction methods greatly improved the rainfall values when compared to imd values hence q q plot for a particular day could clearly bring out the improvement achieved by various bias correction methods based on daily correction factor even though the performance of different methods varied depending on rainfall parameters adjusted eg mean intensity variance or distribution of rainfall bias correction of daily rainfall was also carried out using monthly bias correction factors without the sliding 31 day window as detailed in teutschbein and seibert 2012 the q q plot for the 160th day for the same grid based on monthly correction factors applied on a daily basis fig 5 show a significantly lower performance with nse values varying from 0 56 to 0 84 for different methods when compared to the q q plots based on daily correction factors thus the results figs 4 and 5 indicate that irrespective of the bias correction method the daily correction factors could considerably improve the bias correction when compared to the monthly correction factors 5 1 2 comparison of performance statistics of bias correction methods with daily and monthly correction factors statistical evaluation of bias correction methods with daily and monthly correction factors was carried out for all the catchments using the performance measure nash sutcliffe efficiency nse based on the q q comparison as explained in the previous section nse was estimated for each of the 365 days in a year for the entire dataset for various bias correction methods and uncorrected data with reference to the imd gridded rainfall data observed the distribution of nse values for each grid for 365 days was assessed with box and whisker plots for brevity and illustration purpose the box plot comparison of nse values only for achankovil basin fig 6 is shown as a representative plot the nse values obtained for monthly correction factors based bias correction method was considerably lower than that of the daily based method and also vary over a very broad range this observation is also consistent across other catchments it could be seen from the box plot fig 6 a that for loci mpwtr and dm method the nse values are high for both the cmip5 models cnrm cm5 0 and gfdl cm3 0 although the nse values of pwtr for gfdl cm3 0 model are high but are distributed across abroad range of values as seen from the box plot fig 6 b the nse values are considerably lower across all bias correction methods by adopting the correction factor on a monthly basis as compared to applying correction factor on a daily basis as proposed in this study this may be due to the fact that the choice of an appropriate time scale of correction factor helps in reducing the discontinuities of daily rainfall caused due to sharp changes in bias correction factors between months chen et al 2013 has also reported that bias correction factors calculated on a monthly scale has a limited effect on properties when used for correction at the daily scale another drawback of using monthly time scale of correction factors is that weather extremes which can occur anytime over a month cannot be corrected effectively pierce et al 2015 hence adopting daily bias correction factors seem to provide good improvement in the correction of the rainfall data from climate models prior to their use in hydrologic models in addition to this long term mean monthly rainfall volume of all bias correction methods for all the six catchments was evaluated with those of imd gridded rainfall data the mean absolute error mae was used as an evaluation statistic from table 2 it is clear that the mae of dm method is consistently lower among all the bias correction methods irrespective of bias adjustment based on monthly or daily correction factors this indicates the superior performance of the dm method for bias correction further from table 2 it is very clear that irrespective of the bias correction methods except ls method and the climate zone of the basin the mae for the methods based on daily correction factor is considerably lower when compared to the mae for bias adjustment methods based on monthly correction factors the mae of the dm method based on daily correction factor is the lowest among all the methods for all the basins for the gfdl model the ls method based on monthly correction factor seems to have a lower mae better performance when compared to daily correction factors for all the river basins except achankovil however with the cnrm model the monthly correction factor of ls method seem to outperform the daily correction factor of ls method for only three basins this difference in the performance of ls methods applied with monthly correction factor versus daily correction factor could be due to the simple linear scaling that was also applied at the same monthly scale for correction same monthly time scale as the performance statistics so the mean monthly rainfall with monthly correction factor seemingly performs better than the daily correction factors with rainfall accumulated on a monthly scale while this apparent lacuna caused due to the mere adjustment of mean rainfall alone in the case of ls method is overcome to a greater extent by other bias correction methods especially dm method which clearly demonstrate the advantages of applying daily bias correction factors over monthly bias correction factors applied on a daily basis for better adjustment of rcm simulated rainfall 5 1 3 performance statistics of bias correction methods with daily correction factors for india statistical evaluation of bias correction methods was carried out for entire india using performance measure nse estimated for all the 365 days in a year for the entire dataset various bias correction methods and uncorrected data with reference to the imd gridded data the median nse value for each grid was plotted across india fig 7 to assess the performance of different bias correction methods fig 7 a indicates that the uncorrected rcm rainfall deviates significantly from observations over central and north eastern parts of india all the bias correction methods could improve the rcm simulated rainfall however there are significant differences in the level of reducing the bias the performance of the ls is poor with nse values below 0 4 for most of the north northwest and north east portions of india ls method adjusts only the mean values with respect to imd data while the loci method which corrects the mean wet day frequencies and intensities by the application of rainfall threshold prior to application of scaling could correct the rcm data reasonably well except for the some regions in north eastern and western india fig 7 c this could be due to the fact that loci method does not correct the variance of daily rainfall it is worthwhile to note from fig 7 d that the performance of pwtr method is poor in the north north western and south central portions of india which mostly come under semi arid climate zone except north region which is subjected to high variability in the wet day frequencies and intensities of rainfall this is mainly due to the fact that pwtr method which corrects only the mean and variance was not effective in correcting the bias in wet day frequencies and intensities this lacuna of pwtr method was overcome in this study by carrying out rainfall threshold prior to correction of variance and mean thereby removing the drizzle effect in the models in modified power transformation method mpwtr this greatly helped in improving the performance of corrected rainfall by mpwtr method although the mpwtr method obtained an acceptable nse value greater than 0 6 for most of india north western and north eastern parts of india which is subjected to very low and very high rainfall respectively has nse value below 0 4 fig 7 e this nonlinear transformation may not perform well for rcm simulations having a larger bias due to more number of highly uncertain extreme rainfall events the performance of dm method which matches the distribution functions of observations and rcm simulations was good over the entire country fig 7 f this method which corrects mean variance wet day frequencies and intensities by employing non linear transformation could obtain an nse greater than 0 81 across most climatic regions of india 5 2 evaluation of hydrological impact of bias correction the hydrological impact of bias correction of rainfall was evaluated by simulating the streamflow and comparing with the streamflow obtained using observed imd rainfall data the comparisons were made in terms of median monthly hydrographs flow duration curves and monthly streamflow quantiles 5 2 1 median monthly hydrograph the median monthly stream flows for the simulations with observed uncorrected and bias corrected data were estimated fig 8 shows the plots of the median monthly hydrographs for both cmip5 models in achankovil vaippar and birhidhang basin both the cmip5 models provided consistent assessments of the median monthly streamflows closer to imd simulated streamflow values for dm method in achankovil basin although the performance of mpwtr method as indicated by high nse values fig 8 a1 and a2 were comparable to the dm method the streamflow in achankovil was simulated better by using dm method for bias correcting the downscaled rainfall data while in vaippar fig 8 b1 and b2 all methods except ls and pwtr method simulated the streamflow closer to imd simulated streamflow values in birhidhang basin fig 8 c1 and c2 both ls and pwtr methods under estimated the streamflows during the south west monsoon season loci mpwtr and dm method performed reasonably well in ken subarnarekha and sabarmathi basins fig 9 as indicated by the fig 9 ls and pwtr method underestimated the streamflow in both ken and subarnarekha basin while in sabarmathi basin ls and pwtr methods over estimated the streamflows in catchments located in arid semi arid climate zones sabarmathi and vaippar ls and pwtr methods consistently over estimated the streamflow it was observed earlier that in the vaippar basin there was an overestimation in the number of rainy days with a reasonable estimation of rainfall volume fig 2 b and sabarmathi basin exhibited underestimation of the rainfall volume with a reasonable estimation of rainy days fig 3 f this could have resulted in the poor performance of ls and pwtr methods in these two basins ls and pwtr method which fails to correct the number of rainy days is not suitable for semi arid catchments with large variability in rcm simulated rainfall fang et al 2015 has also reported that ls method is not ideal for hydrological impact assessments if there is a large variation between observed and rcm simulated rainfall distribution due to its inability in adjusting the statistical properties of rainfall other than its mean from the figs 8 and 9 it could be observed that the median hydrographs estimated with rcm rainfall bias corrected with dm method compared closely with the median hydrographs simulated with imd gridded rainfall data this clearly demonstrates the superior performance of dm method in bias correction further the difference in the magnitude of hydrographs for different bias correction method shows that the choice of bias correction method will have a greater effect on the hydrologic simulations 5 2 2 flow duration curve the effect of bias correction of rainfall data on the simulation of streamflow was further evaluated using monthly flow duration curves to assess the efficacy in simulating different ranges of streamflow and its probability of occurrence the flow duration curves with monthly average streamflows simulated using imd uncorrected and bias corrected rainfall were plotted for all the six catchments fig 10 from fig 10 it can be generally observed that in all the six river basins the streamflow simulated using rainfall data bias corrected with dm method followed closely the flow distribution simulated using imd gridded rainfall data further the flow distribution simulated using rainfall data bias corrected with ls and pwtr are not able to replicate the streamflow distribution in achankovil basin which is located in a tropical wet climate except for the streamflow distribution simulated with ls method all other methods of rainfall bias correction are able to replicate the streamflow distribution comparable to those simulated with imd gridded rainfall data fig 10 a1 and a2 the overestimation of streamflow by ls method could be due to the overestimation in the number of rainy days by the rcm fig 2 a which was not adjusted wet day frequencies during the bias correction for this method in vaippar and sabarmathi basins which are located in semi arid and arid climates respectively the streamflow distribution simulated using loci mpwtr and dm method are able to replicate streamflows very similar to those obtained from imd gridded data however the streamflow distribution with rainfall corrected by ls and pwtr methods have a tendency to overestimate the streamflows this overestimation of streamflow by ls and pwtr method could be due to the inaccurate simulation in the number of rainy days by the rcm fig 2 b and f which was not adjusted in terms of wet day frequencies during the bias correction using these methods stream flow distribution simulated with rainfall corrected by ls and pwtr methods have a tendency to underestimate the streamflow in humid subtropical and tropical climate as indicated for birhidhang ken and subarnarekha basins fig 10 c1 and c2 d1 and d2 e1 and e2 this underestimation could be due to the difference in wet day frequencies which is not adjusted by the ls and pwtr methods hence the small rainfall quantities is distributed across more number of days resulting in the underestimation of the streamflows however the streamflow distribution simulated with rainfall corrected by loci mpwtr and dm method very closely followed the simulation with observed rainfall data primarily because the wet day frequencies are adjusted in all these three bias correction methods due to the adjustment of wet day frequencies the antecedent moisture in the model is realistically simulated resulting in a better simulation of streamflow distribution comparable to those simulated with observed rainfall data 5 2 3 performance statistics for streamflow quantiles the evaluation of flow duration curve gives an assessment of overall flow distribution within the period of analysis however this does not give information about the distribution of streamflow for individual months over the period of analysis the ability of different rainfall bias correction methods in the simulation of streamflow distribution for individual months in comparison to simulations with imd gridded data was evaluated using nse the performance statistics nse for various quantiles 5 10 90 95 of streamflow values for each of the twelve months for uncorrected and bias corrected rainfall compared to streamflow simulated using imd rainfall values were evaluated for cmip5 models for all six catchments fig 11 depicts the mosaic plots of nse values as a measure of different quantiles of streamflow values for each month over the 30 year simulation period for achankovil and vaippar basin located on the windward and leeward sides of western ghats respectively the performance of the most of the bias correction methods is poor during the months of jan mar dry season with high variability in nse values these basins experiences winter and pre monsoon rainfall due to western disturbances driven by westerlies in the southern portion of india guhathakurta and rajeevan 2008 one plausible interpretation is that due to highly uncertain nature and small amount of rainfall these disturbances are not adequately simulated by the cmip5 models figs 3 a and 2 b the high nse values nse 0 6 during the other months indicate that the bias correction of rainfall by loci and dm methods were able to replicate the distribution of streamflow in each of monsoon months as observed with simulations using imd gridded data in birhidhang basin located in humid subtropical climate with no dry season the performance of most of the bias correction methods are reasonably good for majority of the months this may be due to the reasonable performance of rcm in simulating both the rainy days and rainfall volume over a year figs 2 c and 3 c however dm method outperformed other methods which is very clear from fig 10 in ken subarnarekha and sabarmathi basins the performance of loci mpwtr and dm methods are good compared to other methods with high nse values for the south west monsoon period despite underestimation of rainfall by the rcm in these basin as observed earlier fig 3 d f this is due to the adjustments in the wet day frequencies and intensities incorporated in these bias correction methods in all the basins the bias correction methods where the wet day frequencies are adjusted viz loci mpwtr and dm are able to reasonably replicate the streamflow distribution during the peak monsoon season however the performance of loci and mpwtr are poor during the dry season in contrast even during the dry season performance of dm method was much superior over other methods in replicating the streamflow distribution of each month further the difference in the nse values for different bias correction method shows that the choice of bias correction method will have significant effect on the hydrologic simulations 6 summary and conclusions the work presented in this paper contributes towards development and validation of a new methodology for bias correction of rcm simulated rainfall on a daily basis using a sliding window approach the two best performing cmip5 models for indian summer monsoon cnrm cm5 0 and gfdl cm3 0 downscaled using ccam are found to have less inter model variability although both the models capture very well the indian summer monsoon south west monsoon there are errors in simulating the peak monsoon month both the models simulate the peak monsoon rainfall month one or two months earlier than the observed peaks further in southern parts of india the retreating monsoon is a major reason for rainfall observed during the months of october to december however the rainfall during these retreating monsoon months rainy days and rainfall magnitude is not well simulated by the downscaled models this bias in the rainfall data was corrected using the new methodology proposed in this study this work compared the abilities of five rainfall bias correction methods namely linear scaling ls local intensity scaling loci power transformation pwtr modified power transformation mpwtr and distribution mapping dm in correcting rcm simulations for entire india with daily correction factors the q q plots clearly demonstrated that the bias correction with daily factors was much superior when compared to methods based on monthly correction factors the median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse based on the q q plots over the 365 days across india depicted that the dm method was able to bias correct the rcm rainfall data more reliably irrespective of the seasons or climate zones assessment of streamflow in terms of monthly median hydrographs flow duration curves and monthly flow distributions clearly demonstrate that the bias correction methods have considerable impact in the simulation of streamflow the bias correction methods which account for wet day frequency adjustments are able to replicate the streamflow reasonably well nse 0 6 especially the loci mpwtr and dm method of bias correction of rainfall was able to replicate the monthly streamflow during the monsoon months however the dm method of bias correction of rainfall was able to replicate the monthly streamflow distribution even during the dry months with less number of rainy days this clearly shows that the dm method based on daily correction factors of rcm rainfall would be a suitable method irrespective of seasons or climate zone for a realistic simulation of hydrologic impacts of climate change the main advantage of the proposed new methodology is the ability to preserve the daily characteristics of the rainfall this method of bias correction based on daily factors enables a smooth transition of daily correction factors thus can be considered more appropriate than a sharp transition which occurs in monthly correction factors when applied on a daily time scale furthermore in the proposed sliding window approach seasonal cycle of the climatology in a region can be replicated well thereby avoiding climatological discontinuities that occur at the transition between months as in traditional methods hence the proposed method appears to be versatile and can be applied to other regional climatic zones across monsoon influenced countries it can also be concluded from this study that the dm method is the best daily precipitation bias correction technique further this study also emphasizes the importance of the selection of appropriate bias correction method and applying them on a daily time scale for watersheds to make realistic hydrological assessments although this study demonstrated that the general distribution patterns of the stream flow are well replicated by the proposed bias correction method it did not focus on the effectiveness of the bias correction technique in replicating the hydrological extremes hence the future scope of work could assess the effectiveness of the bias correction data in terms of replicating low flow indices and high flow indices this would help to improve the reliability of climate change impact assessment on different flow regimes that delivers different ecosystem services acknowledgement we would like to acknowledge cccr iitm and imd india for providing the data to perform this study
