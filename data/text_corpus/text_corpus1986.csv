9930,this study aims to determine the effects and the response to irrigation regimes i rainfed ii deficit irrigation di and iii full irrigation fi on wine and grape skin seed and aromatic composition of grapevine cv bobal the results show that the deficit irrigation treatment can modulate some important parameters of grapes and wine colour and the aromatic composition of the grapes with respect to rainfed and or unlimited irrigation in general alcohol concentration and total acidity of the wines decreased with the application of water while berry weight increased wine colour total phenolics and anthocyanins increased when water application was restricted due to the effect of water stress on anthocyanins tannins and colour parameters of the grape skins and seeds the water regime did not affect the seed polymeric concentration values while the polymerization of grape skin tannins higher mdp amw and g from the irrigated treatments positively affected must astringency some aromatic precursors such as benzaldehyde guaiacol 4 ethylphenol 4 vinylphenol α ionone γ decalactone syringaldehyde and vainillin increased in the irrigated treatments with respect to rainfed benzanoic acid 3 hydroxybenzaldehyde and octanoic acid content also increased with respect to the full irrigation treatment these increases can favour metabolic pathways that enhance specific volatile aromas in the wines affecting their sensory quality the overall the results presented demonstrate the important role played by the irrigation regime in modulating bobal grapes and wine composition keywords bobal regulated deficit irrigation tannins anthocyanins skin and seed polyphenols aroma compounds 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions irrigation is one of the main determining factors for grape quality and as a consequence for final wine composition in this sense severe water deficit might impair the vine s photosynthetic activity affecting the grapevine vegetative development and the overall performance koundouras et al 2009 therefore the expected water scarcity in many winegrowing areas as a result of the climate change scenario may result in negative effects on wine quality such as inhibition of anthocyanin accumulation changes or losses in grape color and or acidity an increase in ph alcohol degree aromatic compounds volatilization through the production of grapes with a low aromatic content and an increased risk of organoleptic degradation resco et al 2016 pons et al 2017 thus in many winegrowing regions it will be necessary to apply irrigation to maintain the sustainability of vineyards and to avoid severe vine water stress resco et al 2016 deficit irrigation di is an irrigation strategy that is widely used in viticulture it consists on the application of amount of water to substitute only a part of the grapevine potential evapotranspiration etc either during previously established phenological stages or during the entire crop cycle intrigliolo and castel 2010 soil climate and agronomic management implemented on the vineyard are closely linked to the fruit morphological development which affects berry size and therefore the surface volume ratio this implies a modification in the amount of skins and seeds in relation to the size of the berry therefore this modification implies a greater or lesser concentration of aromas and anthocyanins located in the skins tannins mainly found in the seeds and also in skins and stem rachis tissues and acids and sugars present in the pulp cells from a winemaking perspective and according to mirás avalos et al 2019 the high surface area to volume ratio of the small berries makes these smaller grapes preferable over the larger berries thus what should be discerned is whether the desirable effects of di on grapes and wine phenolic compounds are due to an increased concentration i e on a fresh weight basis or occur due to enhanced biosynthesis i e on a per berry basis casassa et al 2015 therefore factors such as environmental conditions koundouras et al 2006 grape variety kallithraka et al 2006 and viticultural practices kyraleou et al 2015 have influenced the accumulation of plant secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds in grapes these compounds are known to play many roles in the plant s response to a large variety biotic and abiotic stresses with special importance to water stress caldwell et al 2003 pinasseau et al 2017 from both the chemical and sensory point of view anthocyanins glycosylated pigments which provide color and proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins mainly responsible for the astringent and bitter properties are the most decisive phenolic compounds in the qualitative properties of red grapes and wines casassa et al 2015 also through their covalent reaction with anthocyanins tannins modulate the color of wine forming polymeric pigments with astringent properties and orange or brick red pigments somers 1971 the intensity of wine astringency has been reported to be linked to both berry tannin concentration kennedy et al 2006 mercurio and smith 2008 and composition vidal et al 2003 woollmann and hofmann 2013 thus some studies chira et al 2011 quijada morín et al 2012 have suggested that the astringency of the wines was strongly influenced by the composition of the tannins than by the total content of phenolic compounds while others reported that the structural composition of the tannins were less correlated with astringency than the total content of phenolics and tannins kyraleou et al 2016 also according to these authors astringency was also shown to be dependent on the presence of galloyl groups g and prodelphinidins proanthocyanidins containing gallocatechin or epigallocatechin subunits although data from different studies such as chira et al 2011 woollmann and hofmann 2013 curko et al 2014 and kyraleou et al 2016 are contradictory the effect of irrigation on the accumulation of anthocyanins in grapes has been more extensively studied than the influence of irrigation on the accumulation of grape proanthocyanidins in general as a consequence of the effect of mild water deficit several authors have reported an increase in anthocyanin content attributed to changes in berry skin to pulp ratio santesteban et al 2011 or modifications in grape microclimate romero et al 2010 and a qualitative modification of the anthocyanin set when more detailed analysis were performed castellarin et al 2007 castellarin and di gaspero 2007 bucchetti et al 2011 ollé et al 2011 hochberg et al 2015 on the other hand the effect of irrigation management on grape tannins accumulation has not been extensively reported likewise comparing cv chardonnay deluc et al 2009 or cv syrah hochberg et al 2015 to cv cabernet sauvignon the specificity variety of these responses has been described this may be related to differences in their phenological stages or to water use behavior hochberg et al 2015 as the composition of phenolic compounds is influenced differentially by the early or late water deficit events ojeda et al 2002 ollé et al 2011 casassa et al 2015 thus in general when grapevines are submitted to water deficit studies have reported an increase in anthocyanins content and in total polyphenol index tpi for instance in the kyraleou et al 2016 study the concentration of syrah berry skin anthocyanins increased when water was limited although they observed that the differences were the highest 2 3 weeks post veraison and decreased afterwards to similar levels at harvest intrigliolo and castel 2009 observed in tempranillo irrigated grapevines that the effect of irrigation on grape color and anthocyanins was dependent on water stress timing and severity in this respect castellarin et al 2007 and castellarin and di gaspero 2007 observed that the anthocyanins synthesis pathway is positively affected by water stress matthews et al 1990 and nadal and arola 1995 reported low contents of phenolic compounds anthocyanins and tannins on less stressed cv cabernet sauvignon grapevines due to the effect of a post veraison water stress similarly salón et al 2005 reported that supplemental irrigation in bobal grapevines decreased grape and wine phenolics by contrast in their syrah studies ojeda et al 2002 observed that a severe water deficit before veraison led to a decrease in anthocyanin synthesis and in cv monastrell romero et al 2010 found that the total grape phenolic content was severely affected by intense water stress cassasa et al 2015 observed over three consecutive growing seasons on cabernet sauvignon grapes and wines that the concentrations of skin and seed phenolics were the most affected by the di regimes suggesting that the impact of these techniques is rather indirect and based on a reduction of berry size regarding berry tannins studies on the impact of water availability are scarce and inconsistent tannins are commonly found in skins seeds and stems although their nature varies depending on the part of the cluster they are found palcual et al 2016 seed tannins are composed of oligomers and polymers of three flavan 3 ol subunits catechin epicatechin and epicatechin 3 gallate prieur et al 1994 while skin tannins also contain epigallocatechin and a minor concentration of epicatechin 3 gallate souquet et al 1996 therefore seed tannins consist of only procyanidins whereas skin tannins include procyanidins and prodelphinidins palcual et al 2016 according to previous studies such as those from kennedy et al 2000 and bonada et al 2015 the accumulation of tannins in grapes is little affected directly by the water deficit of the vine however in cabernet sauvignon assays kennedy et al 2000 reported that the seed flavan 3 ols concentration at harvest decreased due to the water stress while in merlot seeds chacón et al 2009 found that the content of flavan 3 ols and tannins was enhanced depending on the magnitude of water limitation genebra et al 2014 observed that the content of tannins in tempranillo seeds did not suffer variations due to the effect of irrigation although several genes from the biosynthetic pathway of flavan 3 ols were up regulated while zarrouk et al 2012 reported that irrigation increased the regulation of skin tannins roby et al 2004 and koundouras et al 2009 stated that water deficit did not alter the concentration of seed tannins in spite of its impact on berry weight in shiraz and cabernet sauvignon studies respectively in this sense pastor del rio and kennedy 2006 reported that seed tannin concentration was also determined by the weight of the seed and the number of seeds per berry after analyzing the effect of four di regimes on cabernet sauvignon grapes cassasa et al 2015 suggested that tannin biosynthesis was not altered by di as there was no effect of any of the deficit irrigation regimes on seed and skin tannin content they also observed that both the di regimes and the growing seasons had an effect on the amounts of tannins extracted from seeds whereas the proportion of skin tannins was not affected by either of these factors thus the results of the effect of water stress on grape phenolics have so far been inconsistent in many experimental studies it is generally unclear if the reported effects were due to berry dehydration an increased skin to pulp ratio or a change in compound metabolism garcía esparza et al 2018 also according to cassasa et al 2015 phenolics content was season dependent meaning that different growing seasons are linked with specific biosynthetic effects that alter the phenolic content and eventually extraction and retention into wine on the other hand the wine aroma is complex and is one of its main organoleptic properties and it is the final result of a long biological biochemical and technological sequence the wine aroma profile is mainly dependent on two important groups of compounds the free fraction of the aromas which are the volatile compounds and the bound fraction of aromas which are the aromatic precursors these volatile compounds are terpenes c13 norisoprenoids benzenoids c6 compounds and pyrazines with about 800 volatile substances coming from the grape and the aromatic precursors which are non volatile and odorants although they are able to release aromas under the influence of various factors bayonove 2003 the aromatic precursors can be grouped into two groups based on if they are specific aroma compounds or not fatty acids carotenoids and amino acids are considered non specific and their profile is characteristic of the variety specific aroma precursors are defined as those compounds that can produce odorous volatiles by means of one or two fragmentations of the molecule with the structure of the precursor being still recognizable salinas 2013 glycosides volatile compounds bound to cysteine and glutathionic compounds are considered specific precursors of aroma however only the glycosidic precursors are found in all the viniferas constituting a potential reserve of aromas which can be released both during fermentation and throughout the aging of the wines in addition unlike cysteine precursors and glutathione glycosidic precursors are stable and are released both by enzymatic action and by acid hydrolysis salinas 2013 this complexity of the wine aroma makes it complicated to predict the aroma properties of a wine from a given compound alone because its perception can be affected by other wine volatile compounds furthermore the accumulation of aroma compounds in grapes is strongly influenced by a large variety factors both biotic and abiotic including environmental factors such sunlight zhang et al 2017 water availability bouzas cid et al 2018a 2018b vilanova et al 2019a 2019b and viticultural practices such as cluster thinning feng et al 2017 or plant growth regulator application such as abscisic acid aba jia et al 2018 jasmonic acid d onofrio et al 2018 among others therefore scarce information has been published about the influence of the irrigation management on the aroma composition of grapes and wines made from bobal grapes to our knowledge only salon et al 2005 studied the effect of drip irrigation on bobal agronomic performance and the quality of red and rosé wines also according to these authors the market acceptance of bobal wines is primarily based on its high color intensity and tannin concentration in addition sivilotti et al 2020 suggested the importance of further studying the effects of the water regime on the skin and seeds tannins in this manuscript we report the effect of different irrigation strategies applied to a bobal vineyard for three consecutive vintages in a semi arid climate in order to obtain further knowledge about the skin and seed phenolic composition and the aroma compounds of this red variety 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the experiment was carried out in a commercial grapevine of vitis vinifera l cv bobal grafted onto 161 49c couderc rootstock the vineyard is located near requena valencia southeast of spain latitude 39º 29 n longitude 1º 13 w elevation above sea level 750 m and belongs to the utiel requena denomination of origin d o the soil climate data of the site during the three years of the study 2012 2014 and all details about the experimental field work are described in the companion paper by pérez álvarez et al 2021 briefly the vineyard soil was typic calciorthid and the climate in the area was continental mediterranean and semiarid the mean annual temperature was 13 7 13 7 and 14 8 ºc respectively in 2012 2013 and 2014 seasons and the annual rainfall was 291 345 and 272 mm respectively each year also the reference evapotranspiration eto was 1220 1212 and 1280 mm in 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively the experiment utilized a randomized block design with three treatments and four replications per each treatment each replicate had 35 grapevines spread over five consecutive rows of seven plants each although only the three inner rows were utilized for sampling with the two outer rows used as borders since planting in 2002 the entire experimental vineyard was irrigated by a deficit irrigated regime with the standard irrigation rates in the area around 60 mm per season from 2012 on the three irrigation treatments proposed in the plot were the following 1 rainfed receiving only rainfall water 2 di deficit irrigation controlled where irrigation replaced only 35 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration etc 3 fi full irrigation where water was not limiting for the grapevines through the application of 100 etc irrigation scheduling was carried out weekly using the etc eto x kc formula where the crop coefficient kc was 0 6 according to williams and ayars 2005 considerations and eto was the reference evapotranspiration registred by a meteorological station located nearby irrigations began when the rainfed grapevines reached threshold values of stem water potential ψstem of 0 6 to 0 7 mpa for all of the plants the frequency of irrigation varied from 1 to 2 times per week in spring to 5 6 times per week in mid summer with the irrigation doses applied being different in each irrigation event depending on the corresponding water regime thus grapevines from the di treatment received 91 74 and 125 mm of irrigation water in 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively meanwhile fi grapevines received 251 225 and 375 mm of water respectively each season pérez álvarez et al 2021 the drip lines had emitters spaced at 1 25 m which provided 3 5 lh 1 of water to the grapevines the grapevines were planted at a spacing of 2 5 1 4 m so they had two emitters each 2 2 grape sampling winemaking process and oenological parameter analysis for each repetition 20 grapevines were harvested at the optimum time of grape maturation according to the parameters set by the utiel requena d o and which are typical of the cultural practices in the area harvest day was on the 10th 30th and 29th of september in the 2012 2013 and 2014 seasons respectively samples consisting of 600 berries were randomly taken from each repetition and the weight of 100 grapes from each repetition was determined then the grapes were divided into two set of 300 berries one set for determining technological and polyphenolic parameters see details in pérez álvarez et al 2021 and another for analysing flesh and seed and aromatic compounds grapes were stored in isothermal containers to be taken to the laboratory where they were kept at 20 ºc until analytical determinations following the harvest the grapes were destemmed and crushed to obtain the must the winemaking process was performed according to the utiel requena d o usual methodology briefly microvinifications were fermented at about 25 ºc in stainless steel containers one for each repetition a saccharomyces cerevisiae commercial yeast strain were inoculated and all microvinifications were maintained in skin contact for 7 days automatically punched every 4 h the wine probable alcohol degree v v 1 ph total acidity g l 1 tartaric acid and malic acid g l 1 were analysed according to the methodology established by the oiv 2003 lactic and citric acids g l 1 were also analysed enzymatically miura one tecnología difusión ibérica barcelona spain colour intensity oiv methodology and total polyphenol index were analysed according to ribéreau gayon et al 2000 wine anthocyanins mg l 1 were determined according the methodology by ribéreau gayon and stonestreet 1965 all the analytical determinations were performed in duplicate with the results being the average of two analyses n 2 2 3 grape volatile compounds extraction and identification before analysis the grapes were defrosted and after the manual extraction of seeds flesh and skin they were blended at room temperature with an ultra turrax ika werke gmbh co kg staufen germany thus 100 grapes per repetition were mixed with 0 13 m naf and 50 mg l 1 ascorbic acid and centrifuged at 4500 rpm and at 10 c for 15 min to separate the must from the skins after which it was filtered following the protocol by loscos et al 2007 about 70 80 ml of must were run through two lichrolut en merck darmstadt germany 100 mg resin beds which had been previously conditioned with 5 ml each of dichloromethane lichrosolv quality merck methanol and milli q water millipore u s according to the conditions described by loscos et al 2007 with some modifications the acid hydrolysis 100 c 4 h and volatiles extraction was carried out briefly 10 ml of the hydrolyzed sample was percolated through a 50 mg lichrolut en resin cartridge that was preconditioned with 6 ml of dichloromethane 2 ml of methanol and 6 ml of citric acid buffer solution at ph 2 5 afterwards 1 ml of water was used for rinsed the column the precursors were eluted with 700 μl of dichloromethane afterwards 14 μl of an internal standard solution was added to the eluted sample the internal standard solution was 450 μg g 1 of 4 hydroxy 4 methyl 2 pentanone then the solvent was concentrated under vacuum in a rotary evaporator down to 100 μl under a gentle nitrogen current a gas chromatography gc detection was used for analyzing the extract thus an hp 6890 chromatograph equipped with a zb wax plus column 60 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm from phenomenex phenomenex torrance ca usa was used the column temperature was initially set to 40 c for 5 min and then raised to 240 c at a rate of 2 c min 1 with this temperature maintained for 30 min helium was the carrier gas fluxed at rate of 3 ml min 1 a split mode 1 25 injection volume 4 μl injection was used with a flame ionization detector fid detector volatile compounds were previously identified with a mass spectrometer finnigan tracemet ms termoquest austin usa using the same column that was later used in the gc fid for the quantification of the compounds identification of the compounds was carried out by comparison of the mass spectrometric data and chromatographic retention of pure reference compounds benzaldehyde fluka guaiacol aldrich 4 ethyl phenol fluka 4 viniphenol fluka α ionone aldrich γ decalactone fluka syringaldehyde aldrich 2 phenylethanol benzanoic acid fluka 3 hydroxybenzaldehyde aldrich pantolactone aldrich octanoic acid aldrich and isobutyric acid aldrich the standards were used to make the calibration curves for the quantified volatile compounds besides to identify the substance through the interpolation of the retention time of normal alkane c8 c20 kovats retention indices ki were calculated for the gc peaks with fluka buchs merck darmstadt germany analysed under the same chromatographic conditions the ki reported in the literature for the same stationary phase were used to calculate the ki by comparing the volatile compounds retention times with those from pure standards in the present study 28 aromatic compounds were analyzed although only 14 were detected the 14 undetected compounds were not quantified in all the samples and thus they are not included in the statistical data 2 4 grape skin and seed compounds extraction a sample of 200 of the grapes stored at 20 c was counted and weighed and while on ice the skins and seeds were manually separated from the flesh the extraction of the skins were performed at 50 c with 75 rpm stirring for 2 h in a 5 g l 1 tartaric acid hydroalcoholic solution 1 10 skin solvent 10 water 90 ethanol and in the dark the extracts were filtered though crystal wool and lyophilized to a dry powder for the statistical analysis the analytical determinations were performed in duplicate for each extract the grape skin parameters determined in the current study were the color intensity ci and total polyphenol index tpi which were determined using the glories 1978 the puissant león method blouin 1992 was used for the determination of total anthocyanins total tannin concentration was estimated according to ribéreau gayon and stonestreet 1966 the extraction methodology was described by ribéreau gayon et al 2006 and the proanthocyanidin mean degree of polymerization mdp were analysed using the methodology described by kennedy and jones 2001 then according to the kennedy and jones 2001 methodology to purify the crude proanthocyanidins a toyopearl tsk hw 40 f size exclusion media tosoh japan which was utilized a sample of 3 g of seeds was manually separated from the berry flesh rinsed and dried and placed horizontally with 50 ml of a 2 1 acetone water mixture in a falcon tube for maceration at 75 rpm with stirring for 24 h at room temperature prior to lyophilization to a dry powder and to remove the acetone the eluent was concentrated at 35 c under reduced pressure seeds total polyphenol index tpi and seeds total tannin concentration were performed according to the above mentioned methods for the grape skins parameters in order to determine the skin and seeds tannin main degree polymeration mdp a similar methodology as kennedy and jones 2001 and garcía esparza et al 2018 was followed in a solution of 0 1 n hcl in meoh with 50 g l 1 phloroglucinol and 10 g l 1 ascorbic acid a 5 mg sample of the dry powder with the proanthocyanidin of interest was reacted at 50 ºc for 20 min in order to stop the reaction it was combined with 2 volumes of 80 mm aqueous sodium acetate the calculation of the apparent mdp consists of the sum of all subunits flavan 3 ol monomer and phloroglucinol adduct in moles divided by the sum of all flavan 3 ol monomers in moles thus the methodology proposed by garcía esparza et al 2018 was used to analyze the phloroglucinol adducts by a reversed phase hplc dad jasco tokyo japan in order to determine the percentage of galloylation percent g the total galloylated proanthocyanidin were divided by all the identified proanthocyanidins and multiplying by 100 also to calculate the average molecular weight amw the response factor relative to catechin epicatechin epigallocatechin and epicatechin 3 o gallate extrasynthese lyon nord france was used 2 5 statistical analysis irrigation treatment and year were the factors used for analyzing the quantitative data with a two way analysis of variance anova when the differences were statistically significant at 95 probability level p 0 05 duncan s multiple range tests were performed to know the relationships between parameters a simple linear regression analysis was performed significance levels of the correlation coefficient at 5 or higher are reported per each studied season all the statistical analysis were carried out using spss software spss inc chicago il for windows version 11 5 the regression analysis was performed with sigmaplot 14 0 systat software inc san josé ca usa in order to obtain the significances of the linear fittings correlation coefficients between variables were calculated with pearson s correlation analysis and p values were presented 3 results and discussion 3 1 oenological parameters of wine samples the results obtained for the physico chemical parameters of the wines for 2012 and 2014 vintages are shown in table 1 data on the alcohol content ph and the acidity of the wines elaborated in the 2013 season are not reported because inaccurate values were recorded on that vintage due to failure of the analytical equipment employed in terms of wine alcohol in 2012 the driest season with rainfall of 114 mm vs 208 and 119 mm from april to 30th september 2013 and 2014 respectively the highest wine alcohol concentration was reported in rainfed wines this was related to the ripeness of the grapes as at harvest time the berries from the rainfed treatment were more ripe with a higher accumulation of total soluble solids 23 5º brix than the irrigation treatments 22 1 and 21 3º brix in di and full irrigation fi grapes respectively pérez álvarez et al 2021 similarly in 2014 the alcohol values increased with the two most restrictive water availability treatments rainfed and di with respect to fi samples thus the alcohol content of the wines showed a general decreasing trend with the application of water fig 1a correlation r2 0 85 and 0 61 in 2012 and 2014 respectively in relation to all the wine acids parameters determined the interaction between year and treatment was not significant table 3 wine ph was not affected by the irrigation regime table 3 and fig 1b despite the ph being lower in the grapes from the rainfed treatment as compared to those from the fi treatment pérez álvarez et al 2021 contrary to our results salón et al 2005 reported an increase of 0 1 0 2 ph units when irrigation was applied this increase could be decisive for the dose of metabisulphite to be applied and for the risk of sulfur aromas in the wine the total acidity values were found to be higher in rainfed wines with respect to the fi ones with intermediate values found for the di wines although significant differences were not found for the contents of malic lactic and citric acids table 1 shows the increasing trend of the malic acid concentration when water irrigation increased as similarly observed by salón et al 2005 in their bobal wines these authors suggested that the increase in malic acid with the application of water as compared to rainfed cultivation was due to a higher rate of degradation in water stressed vines as a consequence of less shading of the clusters by leaves the different effects of irrigation on the main organic acids was also reported by intrigliolo et al 2012 in tempranillo and by vilanova et al 2019b in verdejo cultivars however romero et al 2013 reported that titatrable acidity malic and tartaric acids in monastrell wine were not altered by the irrigation treatments imposed in a bobal cultivar study salón et al 2005 observed that both irrigation and seasonal conditions influenced total acidity with the total acidity being the highest in the highest irrigation treatment in the wettest season although in the dry season the total acidity was higher in the rainfed treatment in a deficit irrigated cabernet sauvignon vineyard keller et al 2008 found the highest total acidity values in wine and lowest ph in the season with the coolest ripening period of all the seasons and the lowest total acidity values and highest ph in the year with the warmest ripening period however cancela et al 2016 reported a significant effect on the content of alcohol and tartaric and malic acids without significant interactions between treatment and season regarding all the wines color parameters reported in table 1 the interaction between treatment and year was not significant indicating that the effect of the irrigation application was consistent between years the rainfed treatment showed the highest values of color intensity ci total polyphenol index tpi and anthocyanins content with the lowest values being those from the fi samples thus the content of these phenolic compounds and the color parameters in wines decreased with increasing water application fig 1c e similar to salón et al 2005 for bobal wines these parameters were also significantly correlated with the water stress integral which expresses the stress duration and intensity and was calculated from stem water potential determinations see pérez álvarez et al 2021 for more details fig 2a c briefly according to the results reported by pérez álvarez et al 2021 the grapevines from the rainfed treatment showed moderate values of stress ψstem 1 2 mpa in the 2013 and 2014 seasons and severe stress values ψstem 1 29 to 1 45 mpa during most of their pre and post veraison and ripening periods from july 2nd to september 3rd in 2012 fully irrigated vines did not experience any water stress during the growing cycle and in general the di plants had an intermediate ψstem values between the rainfed and fi treatments salón et al 2005 and vilanova et al 2019a 2019b also observed the effect of the irrigation treatments on the tpi values the reported effects of irrigation on wine phenolics and colour composition may be due to a dilution effect higher skin to pulp ratio because of the larger berry size in the irrigated treatments or a direct effect on the concentration of skin phenolic composition in our case rainfed and di treatments had a higher skin weight percentage versus total berry weight 12 4 and 11 7 respectively in 2012 and 26 4 rainfed and 26 5 di in 2014 than irrigated grapes 9 6 and 23 3 in 2012 and 2014 respectively table 2 even though the berries were larger in size in fi pérez álvarez et al 2021 in fact authors such as ojeda et al 2002 and roby et al 2004 observed that in general water deficit treatments increase the skin to pulp ratio as compared to the well watered wines increasing the concentrations of skin tannins and anthocyanins petrie et al 2004 suggested that the decrease in water input reduced pericarp mass which may have increased the seed to pulp ratio and increased the concentration of the phenolic substances in the samples on their part romero et al 2010 2013 reported that the rise in wine polyphenol content tannins and other phenolic compounds observed under the regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatment was probably due to the greater cluster exposure provoked by this water regime also romero et al 2013 also suggested that the phenological period during which the water stress is applied can affect the rdi effects they observed that most of the chromatic and enological parameters measured at the end of both alcoholic and malolactic fermentation in their monastrell wines under an rdi strategy that applied mild water stress from budburst to fruit set during the early season and a moderate water stress during pre and post veraison improved wine quality color intensity alcohol content total anthocyanins and total polyphenol index as compared to those wines from the rdi treatment applied from veraison to harvest 3 2 grape skins and seeds evaluation in order to determine and explain the reported wine composition effects direct determinations of skin and seed phenolics were carried out and the results are shown in tables 2 and 3 as aforementioned in 2012 and 2014 water restriction treatments showed significant increases in the percentage of skin weight to total berry weight as compared to the fi treatment table 2 this affected the content of anthocyanins and other compounds and aromatic precursors found mainly in the skins of the berries also the percentage of seed weight versus total berry weight was higher with the rainfed treatment versus the irrigated ones with the total seed weight in the berries from the di treatment being the lowest in 2012 and obtaining an intermediate value among the other treatments in 2014 table 3 this could affect the tannic compounds mostly present in the seeds and related among other properties to the sensation of astringency of the wines these data may corroborate those presented by junquera et al 2012 who showed that fresh weight was the most influenced yield component by water restrictions in 2013 differences between irrigation regimes were not significant possibly due to this year being wetter and the rainfall during pre veraison sufficient to increase the water available for the grapevines which minimized the differences between the irrigation and rainfed treatments tables 2 and 3 on the other hand in 2013 and 2014 the weight of berries pérez álvarez et al 2021 seed weight table 3 and skin weight percentage to total berry weight table 2 were greater than these values from 2012 year with the driest summer see more details in pérez álvarez et al 2021 this matched with the high influence of the year factor found by garcía esparza et al 2018 on the skin weight of their cabernet sauvignon grapes regarding the phenolic compounds the skin grape anthocyanins and tannins the total grape anthocyanins content the grape skin total polyphenol index tpi and color intensity ci parameters followed the same pattern the rainfed treatment had the highest concentration which progressively decreased when irrigation was enhanced table 2 fig 1g i these results are in agreement with those from esteban et al 2001 kennedy et al 2002 and ojeda et al 2001 2002 who reported that moderate water deficit increases the concentration of phenolic compounds however those studies suggested that these desirable effects of di on grape phenolics mainly occur due to its effect on berry size by selectively enhancing the absolute mass of skin tissue casassa et al 2015 rather than a direct biosynthetic effect matthews and kriedemann 2006 in this trial we reported a direct increase in the concentration of phenolic compounds in the grape skins suggesting that water deficit promoted phenolic compound biosynthesis thus in 2012 the percentage of anthocyanin extractability ae was higher in the water restricted samples with respect to the fi ones however in 2013 it was higher in the irrigated samples than in the rainfed one pérez álvarez et al 2021 indicating that in 2012 the extractability of anthocyanins was higher in the fi treatment and in 2013 in the rainfed treatment with respect to the other treatments in contrast the reduction of anthocyanins with the fi treatment was higher with respect to the water stress treatments in the three studied seasons other authors have attributed the positive impact of mild water deficit to changes in berry skin to pulp ratio santesteban et al 2011 or modifications in grape microclimate romero et al 2010 also in line with our results koundouras et al 2009 holt et al 2010 and cassasa et al 2015 in their cabernet sauvignon studies and bindon and kennedy 2011 and bucchetti et al 2011 reported that the concentration of skin anthocyanins was enhanced by the water deficit regime phenolic compounds synthesis is subject to a greater variation than that experienced by other grape compounds as both the edaphoclimatic and cultivation conditions of each year influence its formation pérez álvarez 2017 this could be related to the fact that the grapevines especially the berries synthesize the phenolic compounds via the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway chassy et al 2012 as a defence against adverse situations either a biotic stress such as response to a fungus attack or a abiotic stress such as that produced by water stress uv radiation or temperature variations deloire et al 1998 1999 cohen and kennedy 2010 it has been hypothesized that anthocyanin concentration may be increased by the selective decrease in the mesocarp rather than the skin growth due to a pre veraison rdi treatment roby et al 2004 petrie et al 2004 or vice versa by selectively enhancing the skin tissue absolute mass matthews and kriedemann 2006 thus kyraleou et al 2016 in a syrah vineyard in greece observed that with water limitation the concentration of berry skin anthocyanins significantly increased but these differences were maximum 2 3 weeks after veraison and decreased thereafter to reach similar levels at harvest matthews et al 1990 and nadal and arola 1995 showed that when applying water deficits of 70 of the grapevine irrigation needs between veraison and harvest the anthocyanins production increased implying an improvement of color in red varieties cassasa et al 2015 reported that both the concentration amount per unit fresh weight and the absolute content amount per berry of skin and seed phenolics were affected by the rdi regimes also in an experiment carried out in pots with the shiraz variety ojeda et al 2002 showed that moderate water deficits increased the grape phenolic compounds biosynthesis and concentration however authors as kennedy et al 2002 and bonada et al 2015 observed that the effects of water availability on the accumulation of tannins in berries were fewer and inconsistent thus in our study the total grape tannins content was only higher in 2012 in rainfed than in the other treatments and the skin grape tannins content was higher in rainfed and di treatments as compared to the well watered samples table 2 these results are in agreement with those observed by intrigliolo et al 2016 where the final tannin concentration in their cabernet sauvignon samples was greater for non irrigated treatments in the case of the grape seed phenolic composition rainfed samples had a higher seed tannin content than the irrigation treatments even if grape seed tpi and the weight of 100 grape seeds were higher from plants the irrigated than from the non irrigated treatments table 3 similar to our results casassa et al 2015 observed that their continuous water deficit cabernet sauvignon grapes increased the seed tannins values they suggested that the higher seed tannin content observed in their full deficit treatment compared to the other rdi treatments was in partial due to the smaller grape weight in our case berries from the fi treatment had a lower seed weight percentage versus total berry weight than berries under the water restriction treatments table 3 even though the berry size was higher in fi pérez álvarez et al 2021 pastor del rio and kennedy 2006 observed that seed weight and the number of seeds per grape determined the seed tannin concentration thus cassasa et al 2015 suggested that while a severe water deficit might have limited seed tannin biosynthesis holt et al 2010 the simultaneous impact of the deficit on lowering grape size overrode this effect thereby enhancing overall the level of seed tannin however koundouras et al 2009 roby et al 2004 and bonada et al 2015 observed that the water deficit did not modify the tannins of the cabernet sauvignon and shiraz grape seeds respectively despite its effect on the weight of the berry on their part kyraleou et al 2017 and bonada et al 2015 suggested that the reduction of seed total tannins content observed under their non irrigated and deficit irrigated conditions was related to the increase in temperature observed on the berries from those treatments bonada et al 2015 suggested that the heating of berries reduced tannins by 20 as compared to those under ambient conditions also kennedy et al 2000 observed that the seed flavan 3 ols subunit that conform the tannins content at harvest in cabernet sauvignon decreased with the water limitation while chacón et al 2009 reported that these compounds increased in merlot seed with water deficiency on the other hand genebra et al 2004 suggested that although several genes from the biosynthetic pathway of flavan 3 ols were up regulated the levels of tempranillo seed tannins were not affected by the irrigation treatments 3 3 concentration of skin and seed polymeric proanthocyanidins the total condense tannins analyzed with the proanthocyanidin mean degree of polymerization mdp the percentage of galloylation g and the average molecular weight amw of grape skin and seed tannin are shown in table 4 as aforementioned seed tannins consist of only procyanidins whereas skin tannins include procyanidins and prodelphinidins palcual et al 2016 thus as observed in the results table 4 tannins from skin are generally larger with a higher mdp while tannins from seed are shorter with a lower mdp according to the studies by chira et al 2009 bordiga et al 2011 and pascual et al 2016 therefore the mdp of skin tannin values were higher than those of seeds and are perceived as astringency in the wine harrison 2018 unlike the seed tannins which contribute to wine bitterness vanderweide et al 2020 water regimes did not affect the seed polymeric concentration values while in the grape skin mdp and amw values were higher in the fi samples than in rainfed and the grape skin g was also lower with the rainfed treatment therefore it seems that the water deficit regime decreased the polymerization of tanins and perhaps even reduced wine astringency with respect to the fi treatment according to garcía esparza et al 2018 the wine astringency is linked among others factors with the berries tannin mdp therefore great values of grape mdp and a higher percentage of galloylation vidal et al 2003 chira et al 2011 might result in more astringent wines thus chira et al 2009 reported that polymeric compounds are increasingly reactive with proteins which enhance mdp as shown in the kyraleou et al 2017 study where their non irrigated syrah grapes had a higher astringency with a higher mdp in the polymeric skin fraction than grapes from deficit irrigated and fully irrigated vines however ojeda et al 2002 in their study carried out in syrah found that the mdp increased with a water deficit treatment and suggested that berry dehydration could possibly affect the sensorial quality of the wine by decreasing its astringency on their part quijada morín et al 2012 reported that astringency was more affected by the subunit composition of the tannins than by the total concentration or the mdp the percentage of grape skin galloylation increased with water application even in 2013 the year with more rainfall table 4 however in their study with syrah grapes grown under semiarid conditions in the north of greece kyraleou et al 2017 found that the grape skin g values had a low consistence throughout the experiment sivilotti et al 2020 did not find remarkable difference between irrigation treatments on the structural characteristics of seed tannins mdp and galloylation either nevertheless kyraleou et al 2017 found a higher percentage of galloylation for seeds at harvest in their non irrigated vines than in the deficit irrigated and fully irrigated samples for both the oligomeric and polymeric tannins fractions generally as it occurred in our work table 4 the higher degree of galloylation of the seed tannins makes them more astringent than skin tannins although the bitter and the astringent perception of tannins is affected by their interactions with the soluble polysaccharides present in the grape must gil et al 2012 kyraleou et al 2017 in syrah chira et al 2009 in cabernet sauvigon and merlot curko et al 2014 in plavac mali and babic and rinaldi et al 2014 in aglianico cultivars also observed higher average percentage values of gallylation in seeds than in skins in the wine panel skin tannins are traditionally regarded as more pleasant and softer and less bitter and astringent than seed tannins maybe because of the lower proportion of galloylated subunits and the presence of prodelphinidins in the skin tannins vidal et al 2003 lisjak et al 2020 according to the regression analysis shown by kyraleou et al 2017 a strong significant correlation exits between galloylation percentage g and mdp for both skins and seeds they observed that for skin tannins a g 2 5 was associated with tannin monomers and oligomers mdp 4 in contrast when mdp was higher than 8 as in our bobal grapes independently of the irrigation treatments table 4 it could be associated with an absence of epicatechin 3 o gallate ecg subunits in skin tannins these authors also observed a similar trend in seeds with values higher than 6 g only related with monomers dimers and trimers while larger molecules mdp 6 had a lower percentage of galloylation g 5 they argued that larger tannins from both skins and seeds were linked to a low ecg subunits percentage 3 4 grape aroma compounds the mean values μg kg grape for the aromatic compounds found in the bobal variety grapes under different irrigation strategies studied in the 2012 2013 and 2014 seasons are shown in table 5 the analytical method used to extract them allowed us to analyze 28 compounds although only 14 were identified and quantified in the bobal grapes including benzenes volatile phenols c13 norisoprenoids lactones vanillin derivatives and acid families on the other hand the major aroma compounds determined during the analysis of grapes were benzanoic acid but not in grapes under the highest irrigation treatment fi 4 vinylphenol syringaldehyde and octanoic acid table 5 the interaction between both factors the irrigation treatments and the season year was not significant in any of the determined compounds indicating that the influence of the water regime treatments steady during the years of study the content of volatile compounds such as benzaldehyde guaiacol 4 ethylphenol 4 vinylphenol α ionone γ decalactone syringaldehyde and vainillin increased with the application of irrigation when compared with the rainfed vines table 5 in any case the correlation between water application and the benzaldehyde guaiacol and α ionone content was significant in all three seasons fig 3a c respectively the reported relationships report for the effects of irrigation regime on the grape aroma compounds benzaldehyde guaiacol and α ionone but they cannot be extrapolated to different soil and climatic conditions because of the empiric nature of the relations explored however the concentrations of benzanoic acid 3 hydroxybenzaldehyde and octanoic acid increased with di or rainfed treatments with respect to the highest dose of irrigation fi also the content of 2 phenylethanol and isobutyric acid decreased with the di strategy with respect to the other two treatments table 5 thus according to alem et al 2019 water stress influences the synthesis of aroma compounds in different ways depending on the molecule family considered in general the abundance of enzymes involved in the production of aroma precursors was positively affected by water restriction deluc et al 2009 alem et al 2019 therefore in the case of benzene compounds an important group in the grape varietal aroma which includes aromatic alcohols aldehydes and volatile phenols gómez garcía carpintero et al 2014 the influence exerted by the irrigation treatments on bobal grapes was diverse benzenoid derivatives tend to be synthetized later during grape development and are present in low quantities in berries gonzález barreiro et al 2015 thus the grape benzaldehyde content that could have a synergetic effect on wine aroma with fruity and floral notes gómez garcía carpintero et al 2011 was higher during the three vintages in those grapevines that had unlimited irrigation fi table 5 the wettest and coldest conditions in 2013 could be the reason behind why the grapes from that year tended to had more benzaldehyde than the other seasons this trend to vary with the availability of water makes it so that benzaldehyde a compound which possesses a bitter almond like odor characteristic of certain wines such as those produced from gramay grapes acts as marker of botrytis infection along with other compounds such as acetic acid furfural and terpinen 4 ol fedrizzi et al 2011 however ju et al 2018 observed that the volatile compounds content after rdi treatments was linked to the amino acids concentration they reported that the increase in benzaldehyde content in cabernet sauvigon grapes was closely related to the concentration of leucine an amino acid which content increased with two deficit irrigation 70 and 80 etc treatments as compared to full irrigation 100 etc samples on the other hand in the present research the 2 phenylethanol content in grapes aromatic alcohol with a rose aroma was reduced with the di treatment with respect to the other irrigation regimes table 5 which could have an impact on the floral notes of grapes while one of the precursors in grapes of this aromatic alcohol is the phenylethyl α d glucopyranoside garcía et al 2003 in wines it is formed by the catabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine throughout the alcoholic fermentation process bell and henschke 2005 contrary to our findings in which the grapes from the di treatment had an intermediate ºbrix content at harvest with respect to grapes from the other treatments pérez álvarez et al 2021 fang and qian 2012 suggested that benzyl alcohol and 2 phenylethanol synthesis was considerably enhanced during ripening however the content of grape benzanoic acid and 3 hydroxybenzaldehyde was higher in grapes from grapevines with restricted water availability rainfed and di than those from the fi treatment table 5 the reduction of the level of benzanoic acid in berries from fi grapevines with respect to those from the rainfed treatment was of the order of 17 44 17 55 and 17 51 for each season respectively in relation to the volatile phenols a significant effect of irrigation was observed guaiacol and 4 vinylphenol showed the same pattern grapes irrigated had higher values than the rainfed grapes 4 ethylphenol was the highest with the di strategy in 2013 the 4 ethylphenol and 4 vinylphenol content was smaller than the values found in the other seasons table 5 volatile phenols play a significant role in wine aroma although depending on their concentrations their influence on the final wine will vary gómez garcía carpintero et al 2011 however as the enzyme that catalyses their formation is inhibited by catechins and catechin tannins which are abundant in red wines the volatile phenols content created in red wines are generally much lower than those in white and rosé wines although in the corresponding red musts the contents in hydroxycinnamic precursors are higher chatonnet et al 1993 thus alike other red wines that contain mostly very low levels of vinylphenols in our samples the 4 vinylphenol content was higher than 4 ethylphenols as observed by vilanova et al 2013 in their young white wines and siero sampedro et al 2019 in their young red wines of the mencía variety regarding α ionone a c 13 norisoprenoid related to tobacco flavour an increase was observed in all the seasons on the fi grapes with respect to the other two treatments table 5 this could be related to the fact that carotenoids from which the norisoprenoids are derived through their biodegradation are mainly located in the grape skin whose weight was higher in the fi treatment even if the skin weight total berry weight ratio was lower than in the water deficit treatments table 2 also savoi et al 2016 observed a greater degradation of carotenoids of white grapes under water deficit in contrast authors such as deluc et al 2009 song et al 2012 and savoi et al 2016 2017 reported that in general water deficit can increase the c13 norisoprenoid concentration by modulating the structural and regulatory genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile compounds sasaki et al 2016 observed that exposing grapes to light was substantially essential for the biosynthesis of cetain norisoprenoids such as linalool β ionone and β damascenone which was not consistent with the α ionone concentration found in our trial in their merlot wines ou et al 2010 did not observe differences in β ionone concentration among irrigation treatments in any of the three years studied in a cabertnet sauvignon assay in which stressed plants received 66 of the water received by the control ones due to a partial root zone drying system bindon et al 2007 reported that the concentration of three important c13 norisoprenoids β damascenone β ionone and 1 1 6 trimethyl 1 2 dihydronaphthalene was enhanced by water stress treatments over the two seasons studied nevertheless when the results were expressed in terms of ng berry instead of concentration ng g these authors did not find significant differences between treatments thus they reported that perhaps the differences observed in the concentration results were due to changes in the volume and or grape weight as a consequence of water limitation also koundouras et al 2009 and alem et al 2019 suggested that the greater concentration of aroma molecules in grapes is sometimes due to a berry size limitation induced by water stress among the lactones pantolactone 2 4 dihydroxy 3 3 dimethylbutyric acid γ lactone content did not shown differences between seasons and treatments in the case of the γ decalactone the most irrigated grapes fi had the highest content especially in 2012 the driest year table 5 lactones a special subgroup of esters are formed by the internal esterification between carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of the parent molecule most lactones in wine appear to be produced during fermentation although their origin also lies in grapes contributing to the varietal aroma ribéreau gayon et al 2006 apparently lactones are produced from amino or organic acids notably glutamic and succinic acids table 5 shows the increases in vanillin and syringaldehyde content with the irrigation treatments however the vanillin content was highest with the di treatment and syringaldehyde with the fi treatment as compared to grapes from the other two treatments both phenolic aldehydes compounds vanillin and syringaldehyde possess vanilla like fragrances in the family of the vanillin derivatives there are compounds whose presence in wine in large quantities is due to their extraction from the wood during aging being much smaller as compared to the amounts released by the hydrolysis of their glycosidic precursors however in non aged wines the reserve of aromatic potential of the precursors can have a subtle influence on the wines aroma and flavor the content of the fatty acids determined in the grape samples isobutyric and octanoic acids varied in different ways with the irrigation treatment isobutyric acid increased with the rainfed treatment and also with the maximum irrigation dose however the isobutyric octanoic acid increased in the treatments where less water content was applied table 5 gómez garcía carpintero et al 2011 also found isobutyric acid and octanoic acid among the most abundant acids in their bobal wines fatty acids are found in berries esterified in the form of phospholipids neutral lipids and glycolipids serrano de la hoz 2014 it is in the grape skins where most of the fatty acids are found with their content being between 1 5 and 3 times higher than in the pulp bayonove 2003 fatty acids have been described with fruity cheesy fatty and rancid notes rocha et al 2004 deluc et al 2009 reported that water deficit affected among others the fatty acid metabolic pathways and although they did not provide aroma precursors their analysis showed that water deficiency had an effect on the amount of enzymes involved in the aroma precursors production alem et al 2019 on the other hand hernández orte et al 2015 showed that the vintage introduced differences in most of the compounds analyzed in their study with most of the precursors synthesized in warmer years and under more sun exposed grapes in tempranillo merlot and gewurztraminer varieties as aforementioned in our case the vintage only affected some of the aromatic compounds volatile phenols detected in bobal grapes table 5 however in their white grape varieties studied bouzas cid et al 2018a 2018b and vilanova et al 2019b reported that the volatile organic compounds were more influenced by the inter annual variation than by the in season variation due to irrigation treatments bouzas cid et al 2018a also reported that mild or moderate levels of water deficit had little or no effects on the composition of the must and wine or its sensory properties in general the results from the present study indicate that irrigation strategies could regulate the grape aroma content with respect to the rainfed and the non water limited treatments thus an increase in certain grape aroma precursors can be obtained by reducing the water content used in the vineyard however due to a the complexity of the formation of volatile compounds in grapes which are determined by the variety and may be influenced by vineyard management and biotic or abiotic stresses alem et al 2019 b the differential responses of specific metabolic pathways that these compounds showed in grapes and c how little studied the bobal variety is despite its optimum winemaking qualities for producing quality wines among other factors additional studies are needed to improve our understanding of how the modifications in grape aromatic potential will affect the final wine tasting attributes and scores 4 conclusions this study shows the important role of irrigation regimes on grapevine cv bobal wine composition and grape quality parameters for grapes harvested at a similar time wines from rainfed or deficit irrigated vines were more concentrated in terms of alcohol and phenolic composition resulting in a much higher colour content this was not only due to a dilution effect due to the positive effects of irrigation on grape weight but also because of a higher content of phenolic compounds in seeds and particularly skin tissues the percentage of the skin and seed weight compared to the total weight of the grapes as well as the skin anthocyanins content and seed and skin tannins were higher in the less irrigated treatments the degree of polymerization mdp amw of the skin tannins and the percentage of galloylation g were lower in the rainfed or even in di grapes with respect to fi ones this leads us to think that the astringency perception and possibly the bitterness sensation since the seed bitterness can be compensated by the milder bitterness of the skin tannins of wines from bobal grapes under rainfed and di regime will be lower than those of the fi grapevines in addition it was also demonstrated that the irrigation regime affects the grape aroma precursors and therefore determines the final wine sensory attributes however water deficit affects the biosynthesis of aroma compounds in different ways depending on the molecule family considered thus the grapes from the deficit irrigation strategy were richer than those from the rainfed treatment in volatile phenols content which plays a significant role in wine aroma although their effect on the final wine will be different depending on their concentrations also the grapes from the deficit irrigation regime had higher benzanoic acid 3 hydroxybenzaldehyde and octanoic acid concentrations than grapes from the unlimited water supply grapevines which could be attributed to a change caused by the water deficit on the metabolic pathways of these groups of compounds since the aroma precursors will mark the sensory attributes of the wine it has been observed that perhaps the correct management of water supply for the plant can shape the profiles of the chemical families that the consumer will find in the wine from a practical point of view it can be concluded that watering at 35 of the etc is a recommended irrigation strategy for optimizing grape skin seed and volatile composition in comparison with full irrigation thereby allowing for an increase in yield as compared to rainfed vines as reported in our companion study by pérez álvarez et al 2021 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9930,this study aims to determine the effects and the response to irrigation regimes i rainfed ii deficit irrigation di and iii full irrigation fi on wine and grape skin seed and aromatic composition of grapevine cv bobal the results show that the deficit irrigation treatment can modulate some important parameters of grapes and wine colour and the aromatic composition of the grapes with respect to rainfed and or unlimited irrigation in general alcohol concentration and total acidity of the wines decreased with the application of water while berry weight increased wine colour total phenolics and anthocyanins increased when water application was restricted due to the effect of water stress on anthocyanins tannins and colour parameters of the grape skins and seeds the water regime did not affect the seed polymeric concentration values while the polymerization of grape skin tannins higher mdp amw and g from the irrigated treatments positively affected must astringency some aromatic precursors such as benzaldehyde guaiacol 4 ethylphenol 4 vinylphenol α ionone γ decalactone syringaldehyde and vainillin increased in the irrigated treatments with respect to rainfed benzanoic acid 3 hydroxybenzaldehyde and octanoic acid content also increased with respect to the full irrigation treatment these increases can favour metabolic pathways that enhance specific volatile aromas in the wines affecting their sensory quality the overall the results presented demonstrate the important role played by the irrigation regime in modulating bobal grapes and wine composition keywords bobal regulated deficit irrigation tannins anthocyanins skin and seed polyphenols aroma compounds 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions irrigation is one of the main determining factors for grape quality and as a consequence for final wine composition in this sense severe water deficit might impair the vine s photosynthetic activity affecting the grapevine vegetative development and the overall performance koundouras et al 2009 therefore the expected water scarcity in many winegrowing areas as a result of the climate change scenario may result in negative effects on wine quality such as inhibition of anthocyanin accumulation changes or losses in grape color and or acidity an increase in ph alcohol degree aromatic compounds volatilization through the production of grapes with a low aromatic content and an increased risk of organoleptic degradation resco et al 2016 pons et al 2017 thus in many winegrowing regions it will be necessary to apply irrigation to maintain the sustainability of vineyards and to avoid severe vine water stress resco et al 2016 deficit irrigation di is an irrigation strategy that is widely used in viticulture it consists on the application of amount of water to substitute only a part of the grapevine potential evapotranspiration etc either during previously established phenological stages or during the entire crop cycle intrigliolo and castel 2010 soil climate and agronomic management implemented on the vineyard are closely linked to the fruit morphological development which affects berry size and therefore the surface volume ratio this implies a modification in the amount of skins and seeds in relation to the size of the berry therefore this modification implies a greater or lesser concentration of aromas and anthocyanins located in the skins tannins mainly found in the seeds and also in skins and stem rachis tissues and acids and sugars present in the pulp cells from a winemaking perspective and according to mirás avalos et al 2019 the high surface area to volume ratio of the small berries makes these smaller grapes preferable over the larger berries thus what should be discerned is whether the desirable effects of di on grapes and wine phenolic compounds are due to an increased concentration i e on a fresh weight basis or occur due to enhanced biosynthesis i e on a per berry basis casassa et al 2015 therefore factors such as environmental conditions koundouras et al 2006 grape variety kallithraka et al 2006 and viticultural practices kyraleou et al 2015 have influenced the accumulation of plant secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds in grapes these compounds are known to play many roles in the plant s response to a large variety biotic and abiotic stresses with special importance to water stress caldwell et al 2003 pinasseau et al 2017 from both the chemical and sensory point of view anthocyanins glycosylated pigments which provide color and proanthocyanidins or condensed tannins mainly responsible for the astringent and bitter properties are the most decisive phenolic compounds in the qualitative properties of red grapes and wines casassa et al 2015 also through their covalent reaction with anthocyanins tannins modulate the color of wine forming polymeric pigments with astringent properties and orange or brick red pigments somers 1971 the intensity of wine astringency has been reported to be linked to both berry tannin concentration kennedy et al 2006 mercurio and smith 2008 and composition vidal et al 2003 woollmann and hofmann 2013 thus some studies chira et al 2011 quijada morín et al 2012 have suggested that the astringency of the wines was strongly influenced by the composition of the tannins than by the total content of phenolic compounds while others reported that the structural composition of the tannins were less correlated with astringency than the total content of phenolics and tannins kyraleou et al 2016 also according to these authors astringency was also shown to be dependent on the presence of galloyl groups g and prodelphinidins proanthocyanidins containing gallocatechin or epigallocatechin subunits although data from different studies such as chira et al 2011 woollmann and hofmann 2013 curko et al 2014 and kyraleou et al 2016 are contradictory the effect of irrigation on the accumulation of anthocyanins in grapes has been more extensively studied than the influence of irrigation on the accumulation of grape proanthocyanidins in general as a consequence of the effect of mild water deficit several authors have reported an increase in anthocyanin content attributed to changes in berry skin to pulp ratio santesteban et al 2011 or modifications in grape microclimate romero et al 2010 and a qualitative modification of the anthocyanin set when more detailed analysis were performed castellarin et al 2007 castellarin and di gaspero 2007 bucchetti et al 2011 ollé et al 2011 hochberg et al 2015 on the other hand the effect of irrigation management on grape tannins accumulation has not been extensively reported likewise comparing cv chardonnay deluc et al 2009 or cv syrah hochberg et al 2015 to cv cabernet sauvignon the specificity variety of these responses has been described this may be related to differences in their phenological stages or to water use behavior hochberg et al 2015 as the composition of phenolic compounds is influenced differentially by the early or late water deficit events ojeda et al 2002 ollé et al 2011 casassa et al 2015 thus in general when grapevines are submitted to water deficit studies have reported an increase in anthocyanins content and in total polyphenol index tpi for instance in the kyraleou et al 2016 study the concentration of syrah berry skin anthocyanins increased when water was limited although they observed that the differences were the highest 2 3 weeks post veraison and decreased afterwards to similar levels at harvest intrigliolo and castel 2009 observed in tempranillo irrigated grapevines that the effect of irrigation on grape color and anthocyanins was dependent on water stress timing and severity in this respect castellarin et al 2007 and castellarin and di gaspero 2007 observed that the anthocyanins synthesis pathway is positively affected by water stress matthews et al 1990 and nadal and arola 1995 reported low contents of phenolic compounds anthocyanins and tannins on less stressed cv cabernet sauvignon grapevines due to the effect of a post veraison water stress similarly salón et al 2005 reported that supplemental irrigation in bobal grapevines decreased grape and wine phenolics by contrast in their syrah studies ojeda et al 2002 observed that a severe water deficit before veraison led to a decrease in anthocyanin synthesis and in cv monastrell romero et al 2010 found that the total grape phenolic content was severely affected by intense water stress cassasa et al 2015 observed over three consecutive growing seasons on cabernet sauvignon grapes and wines that the concentrations of skin and seed phenolics were the most affected by the di regimes suggesting that the impact of these techniques is rather indirect and based on a reduction of berry size regarding berry tannins studies on the impact of water availability are scarce and inconsistent tannins are commonly found in skins seeds and stems although their nature varies depending on the part of the cluster they are found palcual et al 2016 seed tannins are composed of oligomers and polymers of three flavan 3 ol subunits catechin epicatechin and epicatechin 3 gallate prieur et al 1994 while skin tannins also contain epigallocatechin and a minor concentration of epicatechin 3 gallate souquet et al 1996 therefore seed tannins consist of only procyanidins whereas skin tannins include procyanidins and prodelphinidins palcual et al 2016 according to previous studies such as those from kennedy et al 2000 and bonada et al 2015 the accumulation of tannins in grapes is little affected directly by the water deficit of the vine however in cabernet sauvignon assays kennedy et al 2000 reported that the seed flavan 3 ols concentration at harvest decreased due to the water stress while in merlot seeds chacón et al 2009 found that the content of flavan 3 ols and tannins was enhanced depending on the magnitude of water limitation genebra et al 2014 observed that the content of tannins in tempranillo seeds did not suffer variations due to the effect of irrigation although several genes from the biosynthetic pathway of flavan 3 ols were up regulated while zarrouk et al 2012 reported that irrigation increased the regulation of skin tannins roby et al 2004 and koundouras et al 2009 stated that water deficit did not alter the concentration of seed tannins in spite of its impact on berry weight in shiraz and cabernet sauvignon studies respectively in this sense pastor del rio and kennedy 2006 reported that seed tannin concentration was also determined by the weight of the seed and the number of seeds per berry after analyzing the effect of four di regimes on cabernet sauvignon grapes cassasa et al 2015 suggested that tannin biosynthesis was not altered by di as there was no effect of any of the deficit irrigation regimes on seed and skin tannin content they also observed that both the di regimes and the growing seasons had an effect on the amounts of tannins extracted from seeds whereas the proportion of skin tannins was not affected by either of these factors thus the results of the effect of water stress on grape phenolics have so far been inconsistent in many experimental studies it is generally unclear if the reported effects were due to berry dehydration an increased skin to pulp ratio or a change in compound metabolism garcía esparza et al 2018 also according to cassasa et al 2015 phenolics content was season dependent meaning that different growing seasons are linked with specific biosynthetic effects that alter the phenolic content and eventually extraction and retention into wine on the other hand the wine aroma is complex and is one of its main organoleptic properties and it is the final result of a long biological biochemical and technological sequence the wine aroma profile is mainly dependent on two important groups of compounds the free fraction of the aromas which are the volatile compounds and the bound fraction of aromas which are the aromatic precursors these volatile compounds are terpenes c13 norisoprenoids benzenoids c6 compounds and pyrazines with about 800 volatile substances coming from the grape and the aromatic precursors which are non volatile and odorants although they are able to release aromas under the influence of various factors bayonove 2003 the aromatic precursors can be grouped into two groups based on if they are specific aroma compounds or not fatty acids carotenoids and amino acids are considered non specific and their profile is characteristic of the variety specific aroma precursors are defined as those compounds that can produce odorous volatiles by means of one or two fragmentations of the molecule with the structure of the precursor being still recognizable salinas 2013 glycosides volatile compounds bound to cysteine and glutathionic compounds are considered specific precursors of aroma however only the glycosidic precursors are found in all the viniferas constituting a potential reserve of aromas which can be released both during fermentation and throughout the aging of the wines in addition unlike cysteine precursors and glutathione glycosidic precursors are stable and are released both by enzymatic action and by acid hydrolysis salinas 2013 this complexity of the wine aroma makes it complicated to predict the aroma properties of a wine from a given compound alone because its perception can be affected by other wine volatile compounds furthermore the accumulation of aroma compounds in grapes is strongly influenced by a large variety factors both biotic and abiotic including environmental factors such sunlight zhang et al 2017 water availability bouzas cid et al 2018a 2018b vilanova et al 2019a 2019b and viticultural practices such as cluster thinning feng et al 2017 or plant growth regulator application such as abscisic acid aba jia et al 2018 jasmonic acid d onofrio et al 2018 among others therefore scarce information has been published about the influence of the irrigation management on the aroma composition of grapes and wines made from bobal grapes to our knowledge only salon et al 2005 studied the effect of drip irrigation on bobal agronomic performance and the quality of red and rosé wines also according to these authors the market acceptance of bobal wines is primarily based on its high color intensity and tannin concentration in addition sivilotti et al 2020 suggested the importance of further studying the effects of the water regime on the skin and seeds tannins in this manuscript we report the effect of different irrigation strategies applied to a bobal vineyard for three consecutive vintages in a semi arid climate in order to obtain further knowledge about the skin and seed phenolic composition and the aroma compounds of this red variety 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the experiment was carried out in a commercial grapevine of vitis vinifera l cv bobal grafted onto 161 49c couderc rootstock the vineyard is located near requena valencia southeast of spain latitude 39º 29 n longitude 1º 13 w elevation above sea level 750 m and belongs to the utiel requena denomination of origin d o the soil climate data of the site during the three years of the study 2012 2014 and all details about the experimental field work are described in the companion paper by pérez álvarez et al 2021 briefly the vineyard soil was typic calciorthid and the climate in the area was continental mediterranean and semiarid the mean annual temperature was 13 7 13 7 and 14 8 ºc respectively in 2012 2013 and 2014 seasons and the annual rainfall was 291 345 and 272 mm respectively each year also the reference evapotranspiration eto was 1220 1212 and 1280 mm in 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively the experiment utilized a randomized block design with three treatments and four replications per each treatment each replicate had 35 grapevines spread over five consecutive rows of seven plants each although only the three inner rows were utilized for sampling with the two outer rows used as borders since planting in 2002 the entire experimental vineyard was irrigated by a deficit irrigated regime with the standard irrigation rates in the area around 60 mm per season from 2012 on the three irrigation treatments proposed in the plot were the following 1 rainfed receiving only rainfall water 2 di deficit irrigation controlled where irrigation replaced only 35 of the estimated crop evapotranspiration etc 3 fi full irrigation where water was not limiting for the grapevines through the application of 100 etc irrigation scheduling was carried out weekly using the etc eto x kc formula where the crop coefficient kc was 0 6 according to williams and ayars 2005 considerations and eto was the reference evapotranspiration registred by a meteorological station located nearby irrigations began when the rainfed grapevines reached threshold values of stem water potential ψstem of 0 6 to 0 7 mpa for all of the plants the frequency of irrigation varied from 1 to 2 times per week in spring to 5 6 times per week in mid summer with the irrigation doses applied being different in each irrigation event depending on the corresponding water regime thus grapevines from the di treatment received 91 74 and 125 mm of irrigation water in 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively meanwhile fi grapevines received 251 225 and 375 mm of water respectively each season pérez álvarez et al 2021 the drip lines had emitters spaced at 1 25 m which provided 3 5 lh 1 of water to the grapevines the grapevines were planted at a spacing of 2 5 1 4 m so they had two emitters each 2 2 grape sampling winemaking process and oenological parameter analysis for each repetition 20 grapevines were harvested at the optimum time of grape maturation according to the parameters set by the utiel requena d o and which are typical of the cultural practices in the area harvest day was on the 10th 30th and 29th of september in the 2012 2013 and 2014 seasons respectively samples consisting of 600 berries were randomly taken from each repetition and the weight of 100 grapes from each repetition was determined then the grapes were divided into two set of 300 berries one set for determining technological and polyphenolic parameters see details in pérez álvarez et al 2021 and another for analysing flesh and seed and aromatic compounds grapes were stored in isothermal containers to be taken to the laboratory where they were kept at 20 ºc until analytical determinations following the harvest the grapes were destemmed and crushed to obtain the must the winemaking process was performed according to the utiel requena d o usual methodology briefly microvinifications were fermented at about 25 ºc in stainless steel containers one for each repetition a saccharomyces cerevisiae commercial yeast strain were inoculated and all microvinifications were maintained in skin contact for 7 days automatically punched every 4 h the wine probable alcohol degree v v 1 ph total acidity g l 1 tartaric acid and malic acid g l 1 were analysed according to the methodology established by the oiv 2003 lactic and citric acids g l 1 were also analysed enzymatically miura one tecnología difusión ibérica barcelona spain colour intensity oiv methodology and total polyphenol index were analysed according to ribéreau gayon et al 2000 wine anthocyanins mg l 1 were determined according the methodology by ribéreau gayon and stonestreet 1965 all the analytical determinations were performed in duplicate with the results being the average of two analyses n 2 2 3 grape volatile compounds extraction and identification before analysis the grapes were defrosted and after the manual extraction of seeds flesh and skin they were blended at room temperature with an ultra turrax ika werke gmbh co kg staufen germany thus 100 grapes per repetition were mixed with 0 13 m naf and 50 mg l 1 ascorbic acid and centrifuged at 4500 rpm and at 10 c for 15 min to separate the must from the skins after which it was filtered following the protocol by loscos et al 2007 about 70 80 ml of must were run through two lichrolut en merck darmstadt germany 100 mg resin beds which had been previously conditioned with 5 ml each of dichloromethane lichrosolv quality merck methanol and milli q water millipore u s according to the conditions described by loscos et al 2007 with some modifications the acid hydrolysis 100 c 4 h and volatiles extraction was carried out briefly 10 ml of the hydrolyzed sample was percolated through a 50 mg lichrolut en resin cartridge that was preconditioned with 6 ml of dichloromethane 2 ml of methanol and 6 ml of citric acid buffer solution at ph 2 5 afterwards 1 ml of water was used for rinsed the column the precursors were eluted with 700 μl of dichloromethane afterwards 14 μl of an internal standard solution was added to the eluted sample the internal standard solution was 450 μg g 1 of 4 hydroxy 4 methyl 2 pentanone then the solvent was concentrated under vacuum in a rotary evaporator down to 100 μl under a gentle nitrogen current a gas chromatography gc detection was used for analyzing the extract thus an hp 6890 chromatograph equipped with a zb wax plus column 60 m 0 25 mm 0 25 µm from phenomenex phenomenex torrance ca usa was used the column temperature was initially set to 40 c for 5 min and then raised to 240 c at a rate of 2 c min 1 with this temperature maintained for 30 min helium was the carrier gas fluxed at rate of 3 ml min 1 a split mode 1 25 injection volume 4 μl injection was used with a flame ionization detector fid detector volatile compounds were previously identified with a mass spectrometer finnigan tracemet ms termoquest austin usa using the same column that was later used in the gc fid for the quantification of the compounds identification of the compounds was carried out by comparison of the mass spectrometric data and chromatographic retention of pure reference compounds benzaldehyde fluka guaiacol aldrich 4 ethyl phenol fluka 4 viniphenol fluka α ionone aldrich γ decalactone fluka syringaldehyde aldrich 2 phenylethanol benzanoic acid fluka 3 hydroxybenzaldehyde aldrich pantolactone aldrich octanoic acid aldrich and isobutyric acid aldrich the standards were used to make the calibration curves for the quantified volatile compounds besides to identify the substance through the interpolation of the retention time of normal alkane c8 c20 kovats retention indices ki were calculated for the gc peaks with fluka buchs merck darmstadt germany analysed under the same chromatographic conditions the ki reported in the literature for the same stationary phase were used to calculate the ki by comparing the volatile compounds retention times with those from pure standards in the present study 28 aromatic compounds were analyzed although only 14 were detected the 14 undetected compounds were not quantified in all the samples and thus they are not included in the statistical data 2 4 grape skin and seed compounds extraction a sample of 200 of the grapes stored at 20 c was counted and weighed and while on ice the skins and seeds were manually separated from the flesh the extraction of the skins were performed at 50 c with 75 rpm stirring for 2 h in a 5 g l 1 tartaric acid hydroalcoholic solution 1 10 skin solvent 10 water 90 ethanol and in the dark the extracts were filtered though crystal wool and lyophilized to a dry powder for the statistical analysis the analytical determinations were performed in duplicate for each extract the grape skin parameters determined in the current study were the color intensity ci and total polyphenol index tpi which were determined using the glories 1978 the puissant león method blouin 1992 was used for the determination of total anthocyanins total tannin concentration was estimated according to ribéreau gayon and stonestreet 1966 the extraction methodology was described by ribéreau gayon et al 2006 and the proanthocyanidin mean degree of polymerization mdp were analysed using the methodology described by kennedy and jones 2001 then according to the kennedy and jones 2001 methodology to purify the crude proanthocyanidins a toyopearl tsk hw 40 f size exclusion media tosoh japan which was utilized a sample of 3 g of seeds was manually separated from the berry flesh rinsed and dried and placed horizontally with 50 ml of a 2 1 acetone water mixture in a falcon tube for maceration at 75 rpm with stirring for 24 h at room temperature prior to lyophilization to a dry powder and to remove the acetone the eluent was concentrated at 35 c under reduced pressure seeds total polyphenol index tpi and seeds total tannin concentration were performed according to the above mentioned methods for the grape skins parameters in order to determine the skin and seeds tannin main degree polymeration mdp a similar methodology as kennedy and jones 2001 and garcía esparza et al 2018 was followed in a solution of 0 1 n hcl in meoh with 50 g l 1 phloroglucinol and 10 g l 1 ascorbic acid a 5 mg sample of the dry powder with the proanthocyanidin of interest was reacted at 50 ºc for 20 min in order to stop the reaction it was combined with 2 volumes of 80 mm aqueous sodium acetate the calculation of the apparent mdp consists of the sum of all subunits flavan 3 ol monomer and phloroglucinol adduct in moles divided by the sum of all flavan 3 ol monomers in moles thus the methodology proposed by garcía esparza et al 2018 was used to analyze the phloroglucinol adducts by a reversed phase hplc dad jasco tokyo japan in order to determine the percentage of galloylation percent g the total galloylated proanthocyanidin were divided by all the identified proanthocyanidins and multiplying by 100 also to calculate the average molecular weight amw the response factor relative to catechin epicatechin epigallocatechin and epicatechin 3 o gallate extrasynthese lyon nord france was used 2 5 statistical analysis irrigation treatment and year were the factors used for analyzing the quantitative data with a two way analysis of variance anova when the differences were statistically significant at 95 probability level p 0 05 duncan s multiple range tests were performed to know the relationships between parameters a simple linear regression analysis was performed significance levels of the correlation coefficient at 5 or higher are reported per each studied season all the statistical analysis were carried out using spss software spss inc chicago il for windows version 11 5 the regression analysis was performed with sigmaplot 14 0 systat software inc san josé ca usa in order to obtain the significances of the linear fittings correlation coefficients between variables were calculated with pearson s correlation analysis and p values were presented 3 results and discussion 3 1 oenological parameters of wine samples the results obtained for the physico chemical parameters of the wines for 2012 and 2014 vintages are shown in table 1 data on the alcohol content ph and the acidity of the wines elaborated in the 2013 season are not reported because inaccurate values were recorded on that vintage due to failure of the analytical equipment employed in terms of wine alcohol in 2012 the driest season with rainfall of 114 mm vs 208 and 119 mm from april to 30th september 2013 and 2014 respectively the highest wine alcohol concentration was reported in rainfed wines this was related to the ripeness of the grapes as at harvest time the berries from the rainfed treatment were more ripe with a higher accumulation of total soluble solids 23 5º brix than the irrigation treatments 22 1 and 21 3º brix in di and full irrigation fi grapes respectively pérez álvarez et al 2021 similarly in 2014 the alcohol values increased with the two most restrictive water availability treatments rainfed and di with respect to fi samples thus the alcohol content of the wines showed a general decreasing trend with the application of water fig 1a correlation r2 0 85 and 0 61 in 2012 and 2014 respectively in relation to all the wine acids parameters determined the interaction between year and treatment was not significant table 3 wine ph was not affected by the irrigation regime table 3 and fig 1b despite the ph being lower in the grapes from the rainfed treatment as compared to those from the fi treatment pérez álvarez et al 2021 contrary to our results salón et al 2005 reported an increase of 0 1 0 2 ph units when irrigation was applied this increase could be decisive for the dose of metabisulphite to be applied and for the risk of sulfur aromas in the wine the total acidity values were found to be higher in rainfed wines with respect to the fi ones with intermediate values found for the di wines although significant differences were not found for the contents of malic lactic and citric acids table 1 shows the increasing trend of the malic acid concentration when water irrigation increased as similarly observed by salón et al 2005 in their bobal wines these authors suggested that the increase in malic acid with the application of water as compared to rainfed cultivation was due to a higher rate of degradation in water stressed vines as a consequence of less shading of the clusters by leaves the different effects of irrigation on the main organic acids was also reported by intrigliolo et al 2012 in tempranillo and by vilanova et al 2019b in verdejo cultivars however romero et al 2013 reported that titatrable acidity malic and tartaric acids in monastrell wine were not altered by the irrigation treatments imposed in a bobal cultivar study salón et al 2005 observed that both irrigation and seasonal conditions influenced total acidity with the total acidity being the highest in the highest irrigation treatment in the wettest season although in the dry season the total acidity was higher in the rainfed treatment in a deficit irrigated cabernet sauvignon vineyard keller et al 2008 found the highest total acidity values in wine and lowest ph in the season with the coolest ripening period of all the seasons and the lowest total acidity values and highest ph in the year with the warmest ripening period however cancela et al 2016 reported a significant effect on the content of alcohol and tartaric and malic acids without significant interactions between treatment and season regarding all the wines color parameters reported in table 1 the interaction between treatment and year was not significant indicating that the effect of the irrigation application was consistent between years the rainfed treatment showed the highest values of color intensity ci total polyphenol index tpi and anthocyanins content with the lowest values being those from the fi samples thus the content of these phenolic compounds and the color parameters in wines decreased with increasing water application fig 1c e similar to salón et al 2005 for bobal wines these parameters were also significantly correlated with the water stress integral which expresses the stress duration and intensity and was calculated from stem water potential determinations see pérez álvarez et al 2021 for more details fig 2a c briefly according to the results reported by pérez álvarez et al 2021 the grapevines from the rainfed treatment showed moderate values of stress ψstem 1 2 mpa in the 2013 and 2014 seasons and severe stress values ψstem 1 29 to 1 45 mpa during most of their pre and post veraison and ripening periods from july 2nd to september 3rd in 2012 fully irrigated vines did not experience any water stress during the growing cycle and in general the di plants had an intermediate ψstem values between the rainfed and fi treatments salón et al 2005 and vilanova et al 2019a 2019b also observed the effect of the irrigation treatments on the tpi values the reported effects of irrigation on wine phenolics and colour composition may be due to a dilution effect higher skin to pulp ratio because of the larger berry size in the irrigated treatments or a direct effect on the concentration of skin phenolic composition in our case rainfed and di treatments had a higher skin weight percentage versus total berry weight 12 4 and 11 7 respectively in 2012 and 26 4 rainfed and 26 5 di in 2014 than irrigated grapes 9 6 and 23 3 in 2012 and 2014 respectively table 2 even though the berries were larger in size in fi pérez álvarez et al 2021 in fact authors such as ojeda et al 2002 and roby et al 2004 observed that in general water deficit treatments increase the skin to pulp ratio as compared to the well watered wines increasing the concentrations of skin tannins and anthocyanins petrie et al 2004 suggested that the decrease in water input reduced pericarp mass which may have increased the seed to pulp ratio and increased the concentration of the phenolic substances in the samples on their part romero et al 2010 2013 reported that the rise in wine polyphenol content tannins and other phenolic compounds observed under the regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatment was probably due to the greater cluster exposure provoked by this water regime also romero et al 2013 also suggested that the phenological period during which the water stress is applied can affect the rdi effects they observed that most of the chromatic and enological parameters measured at the end of both alcoholic and malolactic fermentation in their monastrell wines under an rdi strategy that applied mild water stress from budburst to fruit set during the early season and a moderate water stress during pre and post veraison improved wine quality color intensity alcohol content total anthocyanins and total polyphenol index as compared to those wines from the rdi treatment applied from veraison to harvest 3 2 grape skins and seeds evaluation in order to determine and explain the reported wine composition effects direct determinations of skin and seed phenolics were carried out and the results are shown in tables 2 and 3 as aforementioned in 2012 and 2014 water restriction treatments showed significant increases in the percentage of skin weight to total berry weight as compared to the fi treatment table 2 this affected the content of anthocyanins and other compounds and aromatic precursors found mainly in the skins of the berries also the percentage of seed weight versus total berry weight was higher with the rainfed treatment versus the irrigated ones with the total seed weight in the berries from the di treatment being the lowest in 2012 and obtaining an intermediate value among the other treatments in 2014 table 3 this could affect the tannic compounds mostly present in the seeds and related among other properties to the sensation of astringency of the wines these data may corroborate those presented by junquera et al 2012 who showed that fresh weight was the most influenced yield component by water restrictions in 2013 differences between irrigation regimes were not significant possibly due to this year being wetter and the rainfall during pre veraison sufficient to increase the water available for the grapevines which minimized the differences between the irrigation and rainfed treatments tables 2 and 3 on the other hand in 2013 and 2014 the weight of berries pérez álvarez et al 2021 seed weight table 3 and skin weight percentage to total berry weight table 2 were greater than these values from 2012 year with the driest summer see more details in pérez álvarez et al 2021 this matched with the high influence of the year factor found by garcía esparza et al 2018 on the skin weight of their cabernet sauvignon grapes regarding the phenolic compounds the skin grape anthocyanins and tannins the total grape anthocyanins content the grape skin total polyphenol index tpi and color intensity ci parameters followed the same pattern the rainfed treatment had the highest concentration which progressively decreased when irrigation was enhanced table 2 fig 1g i these results are in agreement with those from esteban et al 2001 kennedy et al 2002 and ojeda et al 2001 2002 who reported that moderate water deficit increases the concentration of phenolic compounds however those studies suggested that these desirable effects of di on grape phenolics mainly occur due to its effect on berry size by selectively enhancing the absolute mass of skin tissue casassa et al 2015 rather than a direct biosynthetic effect matthews and kriedemann 2006 in this trial we reported a direct increase in the concentration of phenolic compounds in the grape skins suggesting that water deficit promoted phenolic compound biosynthesis thus in 2012 the percentage of anthocyanin extractability ae was higher in the water restricted samples with respect to the fi ones however in 2013 it was higher in the irrigated samples than in the rainfed one pérez álvarez et al 2021 indicating that in 2012 the extractability of anthocyanins was higher in the fi treatment and in 2013 in the rainfed treatment with respect to the other treatments in contrast the reduction of anthocyanins with the fi treatment was higher with respect to the water stress treatments in the three studied seasons other authors have attributed the positive impact of mild water deficit to changes in berry skin to pulp ratio santesteban et al 2011 or modifications in grape microclimate romero et al 2010 also in line with our results koundouras et al 2009 holt et al 2010 and cassasa et al 2015 in their cabernet sauvignon studies and bindon and kennedy 2011 and bucchetti et al 2011 reported that the concentration of skin anthocyanins was enhanced by the water deficit regime phenolic compounds synthesis is subject to a greater variation than that experienced by other grape compounds as both the edaphoclimatic and cultivation conditions of each year influence its formation pérez álvarez 2017 this could be related to the fact that the grapevines especially the berries synthesize the phenolic compounds via the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway chassy et al 2012 as a defence against adverse situations either a biotic stress such as response to a fungus attack or a abiotic stress such as that produced by water stress uv radiation or temperature variations deloire et al 1998 1999 cohen and kennedy 2010 it has been hypothesized that anthocyanin concentration may be increased by the selective decrease in the mesocarp rather than the skin growth due to a pre veraison rdi treatment roby et al 2004 petrie et al 2004 or vice versa by selectively enhancing the skin tissue absolute mass matthews and kriedemann 2006 thus kyraleou et al 2016 in a syrah vineyard in greece observed that with water limitation the concentration of berry skin anthocyanins significantly increased but these differences were maximum 2 3 weeks after veraison and decreased thereafter to reach similar levels at harvest matthews et al 1990 and nadal and arola 1995 showed that when applying water deficits of 70 of the grapevine irrigation needs between veraison and harvest the anthocyanins production increased implying an improvement of color in red varieties cassasa et al 2015 reported that both the concentration amount per unit fresh weight and the absolute content amount per berry of skin and seed phenolics were affected by the rdi regimes also in an experiment carried out in pots with the shiraz variety ojeda et al 2002 showed that moderate water deficits increased the grape phenolic compounds biosynthesis and concentration however authors as kennedy et al 2002 and bonada et al 2015 observed that the effects of water availability on the accumulation of tannins in berries were fewer and inconsistent thus in our study the total grape tannins content was only higher in 2012 in rainfed than in the other treatments and the skin grape tannins content was higher in rainfed and di treatments as compared to the well watered samples table 2 these results are in agreement with those observed by intrigliolo et al 2016 where the final tannin concentration in their cabernet sauvignon samples was greater for non irrigated treatments in the case of the grape seed phenolic composition rainfed samples had a higher seed tannin content than the irrigation treatments even if grape seed tpi and the weight of 100 grape seeds were higher from plants the irrigated than from the non irrigated treatments table 3 similar to our results casassa et al 2015 observed that their continuous water deficit cabernet sauvignon grapes increased the seed tannins values they suggested that the higher seed tannin content observed in their full deficit treatment compared to the other rdi treatments was in partial due to the smaller grape weight in our case berries from the fi treatment had a lower seed weight percentage versus total berry weight than berries under the water restriction treatments table 3 even though the berry size was higher in fi pérez álvarez et al 2021 pastor del rio and kennedy 2006 observed that seed weight and the number of seeds per grape determined the seed tannin concentration thus cassasa et al 2015 suggested that while a severe water deficit might have limited seed tannin biosynthesis holt et al 2010 the simultaneous impact of the deficit on lowering grape size overrode this effect thereby enhancing overall the level of seed tannin however koundouras et al 2009 roby et al 2004 and bonada et al 2015 observed that the water deficit did not modify the tannins of the cabernet sauvignon and shiraz grape seeds respectively despite its effect on the weight of the berry on their part kyraleou et al 2017 and bonada et al 2015 suggested that the reduction of seed total tannins content observed under their non irrigated and deficit irrigated conditions was related to the increase in temperature observed on the berries from those treatments bonada et al 2015 suggested that the heating of berries reduced tannins by 20 as compared to those under ambient conditions also kennedy et al 2000 observed that the seed flavan 3 ols subunit that conform the tannins content at harvest in cabernet sauvignon decreased with the water limitation while chacón et al 2009 reported that these compounds increased in merlot seed with water deficiency on the other hand genebra et al 2004 suggested that although several genes from the biosynthetic pathway of flavan 3 ols were up regulated the levels of tempranillo seed tannins were not affected by the irrigation treatments 3 3 concentration of skin and seed polymeric proanthocyanidins the total condense tannins analyzed with the proanthocyanidin mean degree of polymerization mdp the percentage of galloylation g and the average molecular weight amw of grape skin and seed tannin are shown in table 4 as aforementioned seed tannins consist of only procyanidins whereas skin tannins include procyanidins and prodelphinidins palcual et al 2016 thus as observed in the results table 4 tannins from skin are generally larger with a higher mdp while tannins from seed are shorter with a lower mdp according to the studies by chira et al 2009 bordiga et al 2011 and pascual et al 2016 therefore the mdp of skin tannin values were higher than those of seeds and are perceived as astringency in the wine harrison 2018 unlike the seed tannins which contribute to wine bitterness vanderweide et al 2020 water regimes did not affect the seed polymeric concentration values while in the grape skin mdp and amw values were higher in the fi samples than in rainfed and the grape skin g was also lower with the rainfed treatment therefore it seems that the water deficit regime decreased the polymerization of tanins and perhaps even reduced wine astringency with respect to the fi treatment according to garcía esparza et al 2018 the wine astringency is linked among others factors with the berries tannin mdp therefore great values of grape mdp and a higher percentage of galloylation vidal et al 2003 chira et al 2011 might result in more astringent wines thus chira et al 2009 reported that polymeric compounds are increasingly reactive with proteins which enhance mdp as shown in the kyraleou et al 2017 study where their non irrigated syrah grapes had a higher astringency with a higher mdp in the polymeric skin fraction than grapes from deficit irrigated and fully irrigated vines however ojeda et al 2002 in their study carried out in syrah found that the mdp increased with a water deficit treatment and suggested that berry dehydration could possibly affect the sensorial quality of the wine by decreasing its astringency on their part quijada morín et al 2012 reported that astringency was more affected by the subunit composition of the tannins than by the total concentration or the mdp the percentage of grape skin galloylation increased with water application even in 2013 the year with more rainfall table 4 however in their study with syrah grapes grown under semiarid conditions in the north of greece kyraleou et al 2017 found that the grape skin g values had a low consistence throughout the experiment sivilotti et al 2020 did not find remarkable difference between irrigation treatments on the structural characteristics of seed tannins mdp and galloylation either nevertheless kyraleou et al 2017 found a higher percentage of galloylation for seeds at harvest in their non irrigated vines than in the deficit irrigated and fully irrigated samples for both the oligomeric and polymeric tannins fractions generally as it occurred in our work table 4 the higher degree of galloylation of the seed tannins makes them more astringent than skin tannins although the bitter and the astringent perception of tannins is affected by their interactions with the soluble polysaccharides present in the grape must gil et al 2012 kyraleou et al 2017 in syrah chira et al 2009 in cabernet sauvigon and merlot curko et al 2014 in plavac mali and babic and rinaldi et al 2014 in aglianico cultivars also observed higher average percentage values of gallylation in seeds than in skins in the wine panel skin tannins are traditionally regarded as more pleasant and softer and less bitter and astringent than seed tannins maybe because of the lower proportion of galloylated subunits and the presence of prodelphinidins in the skin tannins vidal et al 2003 lisjak et al 2020 according to the regression analysis shown by kyraleou et al 2017 a strong significant correlation exits between galloylation percentage g and mdp for both skins and seeds they observed that for skin tannins a g 2 5 was associated with tannin monomers and oligomers mdp 4 in contrast when mdp was higher than 8 as in our bobal grapes independently of the irrigation treatments table 4 it could be associated with an absence of epicatechin 3 o gallate ecg subunits in skin tannins these authors also observed a similar trend in seeds with values higher than 6 g only related with monomers dimers and trimers while larger molecules mdp 6 had a lower percentage of galloylation g 5 they argued that larger tannins from both skins and seeds were linked to a low ecg subunits percentage 3 4 grape aroma compounds the mean values μg kg grape for the aromatic compounds found in the bobal variety grapes under different irrigation strategies studied in the 2012 2013 and 2014 seasons are shown in table 5 the analytical method used to extract them allowed us to analyze 28 compounds although only 14 were identified and quantified in the bobal grapes including benzenes volatile phenols c13 norisoprenoids lactones vanillin derivatives and acid families on the other hand the major aroma compounds determined during the analysis of grapes were benzanoic acid but not in grapes under the highest irrigation treatment fi 4 vinylphenol syringaldehyde and octanoic acid table 5 the interaction between both factors the irrigation treatments and the season year was not significant in any of the determined compounds indicating that the influence of the water regime treatments steady during the years of study the content of volatile compounds such as benzaldehyde guaiacol 4 ethylphenol 4 vinylphenol α ionone γ decalactone syringaldehyde and vainillin increased with the application of irrigation when compared with the rainfed vines table 5 in any case the correlation between water application and the benzaldehyde guaiacol and α ionone content was significant in all three seasons fig 3a c respectively the reported relationships report for the effects of irrigation regime on the grape aroma compounds benzaldehyde guaiacol and α ionone but they cannot be extrapolated to different soil and climatic conditions because of the empiric nature of the relations explored however the concentrations of benzanoic acid 3 hydroxybenzaldehyde and octanoic acid increased with di or rainfed treatments with respect to the highest dose of irrigation fi also the content of 2 phenylethanol and isobutyric acid decreased with the di strategy with respect to the other two treatments table 5 thus according to alem et al 2019 water stress influences the synthesis of aroma compounds in different ways depending on the molecule family considered in general the abundance of enzymes involved in the production of aroma precursors was positively affected by water restriction deluc et al 2009 alem et al 2019 therefore in the case of benzene compounds an important group in the grape varietal aroma which includes aromatic alcohols aldehydes and volatile phenols gómez garcía carpintero et al 2014 the influence exerted by the irrigation treatments on bobal grapes was diverse benzenoid derivatives tend to be synthetized later during grape development and are present in low quantities in berries gonzález barreiro et al 2015 thus the grape benzaldehyde content that could have a synergetic effect on wine aroma with fruity and floral notes gómez garcía carpintero et al 2011 was higher during the three vintages in those grapevines that had unlimited irrigation fi table 5 the wettest and coldest conditions in 2013 could be the reason behind why the grapes from that year tended to had more benzaldehyde than the other seasons this trend to vary with the availability of water makes it so that benzaldehyde a compound which possesses a bitter almond like odor characteristic of certain wines such as those produced from gramay grapes acts as marker of botrytis infection along with other compounds such as acetic acid furfural and terpinen 4 ol fedrizzi et al 2011 however ju et al 2018 observed that the volatile compounds content after rdi treatments was linked to the amino acids concentration they reported that the increase in benzaldehyde content in cabernet sauvigon grapes was closely related to the concentration of leucine an amino acid which content increased with two deficit irrigation 70 and 80 etc treatments as compared to full irrigation 100 etc samples on the other hand in the present research the 2 phenylethanol content in grapes aromatic alcohol with a rose aroma was reduced with the di treatment with respect to the other irrigation regimes table 5 which could have an impact on the floral notes of grapes while one of the precursors in grapes of this aromatic alcohol is the phenylethyl α d glucopyranoside garcía et al 2003 in wines it is formed by the catabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine throughout the alcoholic fermentation process bell and henschke 2005 contrary to our findings in which the grapes from the di treatment had an intermediate ºbrix content at harvest with respect to grapes from the other treatments pérez álvarez et al 2021 fang and qian 2012 suggested that benzyl alcohol and 2 phenylethanol synthesis was considerably enhanced during ripening however the content of grape benzanoic acid and 3 hydroxybenzaldehyde was higher in grapes from grapevines with restricted water availability rainfed and di than those from the fi treatment table 5 the reduction of the level of benzanoic acid in berries from fi grapevines with respect to those from the rainfed treatment was of the order of 17 44 17 55 and 17 51 for each season respectively in relation to the volatile phenols a significant effect of irrigation was observed guaiacol and 4 vinylphenol showed the same pattern grapes irrigated had higher values than the rainfed grapes 4 ethylphenol was the highest with the di strategy in 2013 the 4 ethylphenol and 4 vinylphenol content was smaller than the values found in the other seasons table 5 volatile phenols play a significant role in wine aroma although depending on their concentrations their influence on the final wine will vary gómez garcía carpintero et al 2011 however as the enzyme that catalyses their formation is inhibited by catechins and catechin tannins which are abundant in red wines the volatile phenols content created in red wines are generally much lower than those in white and rosé wines although in the corresponding red musts the contents in hydroxycinnamic precursors are higher chatonnet et al 1993 thus alike other red wines that contain mostly very low levels of vinylphenols in our samples the 4 vinylphenol content was higher than 4 ethylphenols as observed by vilanova et al 2013 in their young white wines and siero sampedro et al 2019 in their young red wines of the mencía variety regarding α ionone a c 13 norisoprenoid related to tobacco flavour an increase was observed in all the seasons on the fi grapes with respect to the other two treatments table 5 this could be related to the fact that carotenoids from which the norisoprenoids are derived through their biodegradation are mainly located in the grape skin whose weight was higher in the fi treatment even if the skin weight total berry weight ratio was lower than in the water deficit treatments table 2 also savoi et al 2016 observed a greater degradation of carotenoids of white grapes under water deficit in contrast authors such as deluc et al 2009 song et al 2012 and savoi et al 2016 2017 reported that in general water deficit can increase the c13 norisoprenoid concentration by modulating the structural and regulatory genes involved in the biosynthesis of volatile compounds sasaki et al 2016 observed that exposing grapes to light was substantially essential for the biosynthesis of cetain norisoprenoids such as linalool β ionone and β damascenone which was not consistent with the α ionone concentration found in our trial in their merlot wines ou et al 2010 did not observe differences in β ionone concentration among irrigation treatments in any of the three years studied in a cabertnet sauvignon assay in which stressed plants received 66 of the water received by the control ones due to a partial root zone drying system bindon et al 2007 reported that the concentration of three important c13 norisoprenoids β damascenone β ionone and 1 1 6 trimethyl 1 2 dihydronaphthalene was enhanced by water stress treatments over the two seasons studied nevertheless when the results were expressed in terms of ng berry instead of concentration ng g these authors did not find significant differences between treatments thus they reported that perhaps the differences observed in the concentration results were due to changes in the volume and or grape weight as a consequence of water limitation also koundouras et al 2009 and alem et al 2019 suggested that the greater concentration of aroma molecules in grapes is sometimes due to a berry size limitation induced by water stress among the lactones pantolactone 2 4 dihydroxy 3 3 dimethylbutyric acid γ lactone content did not shown differences between seasons and treatments in the case of the γ decalactone the most irrigated grapes fi had the highest content especially in 2012 the driest year table 5 lactones a special subgroup of esters are formed by the internal esterification between carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of the parent molecule most lactones in wine appear to be produced during fermentation although their origin also lies in grapes contributing to the varietal aroma ribéreau gayon et al 2006 apparently lactones are produced from amino or organic acids notably glutamic and succinic acids table 5 shows the increases in vanillin and syringaldehyde content with the irrigation treatments however the vanillin content was highest with the di treatment and syringaldehyde with the fi treatment as compared to grapes from the other two treatments both phenolic aldehydes compounds vanillin and syringaldehyde possess vanilla like fragrances in the family of the vanillin derivatives there are compounds whose presence in wine in large quantities is due to their extraction from the wood during aging being much smaller as compared to the amounts released by the hydrolysis of their glycosidic precursors however in non aged wines the reserve of aromatic potential of the precursors can have a subtle influence on the wines aroma and flavor the content of the fatty acids determined in the grape samples isobutyric and octanoic acids varied in different ways with the irrigation treatment isobutyric acid increased with the rainfed treatment and also with the maximum irrigation dose however the isobutyric octanoic acid increased in the treatments where less water content was applied table 5 gómez garcía carpintero et al 2011 also found isobutyric acid and octanoic acid among the most abundant acids in their bobal wines fatty acids are found in berries esterified in the form of phospholipids neutral lipids and glycolipids serrano de la hoz 2014 it is in the grape skins where most of the fatty acids are found with their content being between 1 5 and 3 times higher than in the pulp bayonove 2003 fatty acids have been described with fruity cheesy fatty and rancid notes rocha et al 2004 deluc et al 2009 reported that water deficit affected among others the fatty acid metabolic pathways and although they did not provide aroma precursors their analysis showed that water deficiency had an effect on the amount of enzymes involved in the aroma precursors production alem et al 2019 on the other hand hernández orte et al 2015 showed that the vintage introduced differences in most of the compounds analyzed in their study with most of the precursors synthesized in warmer years and under more sun exposed grapes in tempranillo merlot and gewurztraminer varieties as aforementioned in our case the vintage only affected some of the aromatic compounds volatile phenols detected in bobal grapes table 5 however in their white grape varieties studied bouzas cid et al 2018a 2018b and vilanova et al 2019b reported that the volatile organic compounds were more influenced by the inter annual variation than by the in season variation due to irrigation treatments bouzas cid et al 2018a also reported that mild or moderate levels of water deficit had little or no effects on the composition of the must and wine or its sensory properties in general the results from the present study indicate that irrigation strategies could regulate the grape aroma content with respect to the rainfed and the non water limited treatments thus an increase in certain grape aroma precursors can be obtained by reducing the water content used in the vineyard however due to a the complexity of the formation of volatile compounds in grapes which are determined by the variety and may be influenced by vineyard management and biotic or abiotic stresses alem et al 2019 b the differential responses of specific metabolic pathways that these compounds showed in grapes and c how little studied the bobal variety is despite its optimum winemaking qualities for producing quality wines among other factors additional studies are needed to improve our understanding of how the modifications in grape aromatic potential will affect the final wine tasting attributes and scores 4 conclusions this study shows the important role of irrigation regimes on grapevine cv bobal wine composition and grape quality parameters for grapes harvested at a similar time wines from rainfed or deficit irrigated vines were more concentrated in terms of alcohol and phenolic composition resulting in a much higher colour content this was not only due to a dilution effect due to the positive effects of irrigation on grape weight but also because of a higher content of phenolic compounds in seeds and particularly skin tissues the percentage of the skin and seed weight compared to the total weight of the grapes as well as the skin anthocyanins content and seed and skin tannins were higher in the less irrigated treatments the degree of polymerization mdp amw of the skin tannins and the percentage of galloylation g were lower in the rainfed or even in di grapes with respect to fi ones this leads us to think that the astringency perception and possibly the bitterness sensation since the seed bitterness can be compensated by the milder bitterness of the skin tannins of wines from bobal grapes under rainfed and di regime will be lower than those of the fi grapevines in addition it was also demonstrated that the irrigation regime affects the grape aroma precursors and therefore determines the final wine sensory attributes however water deficit affects the biosynthesis of aroma compounds in different ways depending on the molecule family considered thus the grapes from the deficit irrigation strategy were richer than those from the rainfed treatment in volatile phenols content which plays a significant role in wine aroma although their effect on the final wine will be different depending on their concentrations also the grapes from the deficit irrigation regime had higher benzanoic acid 3 hydroxybenzaldehyde and octanoic acid concentrations than grapes from the unlimited water supply grapevines which could be attributed to a change caused by the water deficit on the metabolic pathways of these groups of compounds since the aroma precursors will mark the sensory attributes of the wine it has been observed that perhaps the correct management of water supply for the plant can shape the profiles of the chemical families that the consumer will find in the wine from a practical point of view it can be concluded that watering at 35 of the etc is a recommended irrigation strategy for optimizing grape skin seed and volatile composition in comparison with full irrigation thereby allowing for an increase in yield as compared to rainfed vines as reported in our companion study by pérez álvarez et al 2021 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9931,in recent years as drought intensifies and agricultural water consumption increases it is of great significance to optimize the irrigation schedule to ensure regional food security this paper constructs the distributed aquacrop model and multi objective genetic algorithm nsga ⅱ simulation optimization mgso model to facilitate the development of a rational irrigation schedule the distributed aquacrop model considers the spatial variability of soil climate crops and management practices which can be batch calibrated using the xgboost method the mgso model is for irrigation schedules under the combination of different precipitation and et0 in this paper crop yield et and water use efficiency wue were simulated and analyzed in 13 irrigation zones in northeast china where the existing irrigation schedules were analyzed and optimized the results showed that the distributed aquacrop model could simulate regional crops well crop yields in the study area ranged from 3 to 10ton hm2 the western part of heilongjiang province and the northern part of jilin province has a higher yield the simulation results of heilongjiang province are more accurate and the relative error is minor the joint distribution model constructed by the frank copula function can describe the joint probability distribution characteristics of precipitation and et0 according to the simulation results each typical station has a different performance under the existing irrigation schedule under different situations the crop yield and wue of some stations changed significantly the maximum and minimum yield difference was 22 for harbin 32 for heihe and 21 for dunhua it is mainly due to the irrigation amount in some scenarios that do not meet crop water requirements under the optimized irrigation schedule the crop yield and wue in different scenarios have been improved by the mgso model in the harbin station graphical abstract ga1 keywords distributed aquacrop model optimization of irrigation schedule joint probability bach processing 1 introduction water scarcity is an important socio economic and global sustainability issue hoque et al 2021 wei et al 2021 which leads to the increasing contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources at the same time the available water for agricultural irrigation gradually reduced it is of great significance to establish a sound irrigation schedule to improve agricultural water use efficiency wue and promote sustainable agricultural development chen et al 2021 sexton et al 2021 st aime et al 2021 traditionally the establishment of an irrigation schedule is based on precipitation of different level years however irrigation amount is determined by precipitation and reference crop evaporation et0 during the growth period wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 therefore it is essential to analyze and optimize irrigation schedules in different regions under different situations divided by the joint distribution of precipitation and et0 irrigation schedule optimization is essential to rationally establish an irrigation schedule delgoda et al 2017 li et al 2019 its core idea is to determine how to allocate limited water in the growth period of crops to achieve maximum crop yield or maximum benefit abrishambaf et al 2020 alonso campos et al 2020 irrigation schedule optimization methods mainly include linear programming nonlinear programming and dynamic programming most water resources optimization allocation is under the scale of the whole growth period month and the ten day li et al 2005 however due to the simple consideration of the evapotranspiration process and its influence on crop yield these methods are difficult to reflect the yield changes under different irrigation conditions objectively it is difficult to determine the specific irrigation dates the crop growth simulation model can simulate crop yield changes under different irrigation conditions combining the simulation model with the optimization model to optimize the crop irrigation schedule can effectively solve the above problems crop models can effectively estimate crop water consumption yield and wue nowadays dssat ma et al 2020 epic qiao et al 2018 and wofost de wit et al 2019 are the most generally used crop models growth status and water consumption of the crops at the field scale can be simulated accurately however compared with the aquacrop model they are more complex han et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 just s few input parameters can meet the aquacrop model s demand which is more straightforward intuitive and easy to obtain the aquacrop model is developed rapidly and can be applied worldwide because of its applicability to various crops the aquacrop model has been used in many experiments and researches on optimizing irrigation management measures and predicting crop yield under climate change its application has been pervasive and mature new progressive models have been established based on gis development by which spatial variation of regional factors such as soil climate crop type and irrigation can be analyzed as a result spatially distributed models have been developed such as the swap model zhao et al 2020 the swap epic model xu et al 2016 swap wofost model hu et al 2019 and the hydrus epic model spatial variation of crop growing is considered in these distributed models to improve the simulation accuracy however they have a strict requirement on parameter calibration and input data preparation limiting their applications under which circumstances simple distributed models should be developed therefore in this study 1 distributed aquacrop model was established based on batch processing parameter calibration 2 copula function was used to quantify the two dimensional joint probability distribution model of precipitation and et0 to analyze the combination of dry and wet conditions in different regions 3 irrigation schedules under different conditions were analyzed and optimized by nsga ⅱmethod 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the problem a reasonable irrigation schedule is of great significance in improving regional agricultural wue and promoting sustainable agricultural development the crop model can describe crop growth and development processes more comprehensively compared with the water production function therefore the crop model performs better in analyzing and optimizing the irrigation schedule the spatial heterogeneity of soil climate crop and management measures is considered in the distributed crop model which can accurately simulate regional crop growth by embedding an independent model in each simulation unit the model s input and output data are managed uniformly and the regional simulation of the model is realized precipitation and et0 are two important hydrological variables in the irrigation schedule the irrigation schedule needs to consider the combined effects of precipitation and et0 the copula function is used to fit the two dimensional joint probability distribution model of precipitation and et0 which can be closer to the actual situation and make the analysis and optimization of the irrigation schedule more comprehensive does this paper mainly answer the following questions 1 how to build a distributed crop model and simulate it on a large scale 2 how does the existing irrigation schedule perform under different dry and wet combination scenarios of et0 and precipitation 3 how to optimize the irrigation schedule in different scenarios 2 2 study area and data collection the study area consists of three provinces in northeast china including liaoning jilin and heilongjiang the three provinces geographical location in northeast china is 38 54 n and 118 5 135 e the highest latitude in china the study area belongs to the temperate monsoon climate due to the higher latitudes the winters are long and cold and the summers are warm and short the study area is mainly in the middle temperate zone and a few in the cold and warm temperate zones the annual average temperature is 3 8 11 3 and the temperature increases gradually from north to south the annual precipitation are 368 1064 mm the annual frost free period is 140 170d zhang et al 2020 fig 1 the aquacrop crop model s input data mainly includes four parts meteorological data soil data crop data and management data

average wind speed etc soil data are from china s 1 1 million soil database mainly soil texture soil organic matter content and soil profile crop data these mainly covered the parameters of growth and development such as canopy coverage root growth and growth season evaporation and transpiration yield formation and stress the growth season was directly obtained from the decade dataset of crop growth and development and soil moisture in china the sensitive parameters were obtained from model calibration while non sensitive parameters were obtained from the reference values of the crop model

were obtained from the rural statistical yearbook and statistical yearbook management data are taken from china irrigation and drainage center and model default values they mainly included irrigation fertilization and surface coverage fig 2 shows the geographical location distribution of meteorological stations farmland soil type irrigation zoning and typical counties 2 3 distributed aquacrop model 2 3 1 the establishment of distributed aquacrop model aquacrop is a crop growth model developed by fao in 2009 er raki et al 2021 it is a water driven model that affects crop yields controlled by the amount of soil water content the model mainly contains three primary modules of crop growth atmospheric components and soil water balance fao irrigation and drainage document no 33 gives the conversion relationship between crop yield and water response as shown in eq 1 1 y x y 0 y x k y e t x e t 0 e t x where y x is potential yield kg m2 y 0 is actual yield kg m2 e t x is potential evapotranspiration mm e t 0 is actual evapotranspiration mm k y is coefficient of yield response to water the equations of the aquacrop model are improved the evapotranspiration equations are divided into soil evaporation and crop transpiration it avoids the confusion between the effects of non productive water soil evaporation and productive water crop transpiration the final yield was expressed as biomass and harvest index to highlight the impact of water stress the improved formula is as follows 2 y b h i 3 b w p t r the final crop yield kg m2 b is biomass kg m2 is harvest index w p is biomass wue kg m2 mm t r is crop transpiration mm according to the principle and operation of aquacrop training handbooks based on the aquacrop model at a single scale the distributed aquacrop model is established the steps of establishing distributed aquacrop model are as follows at first based on the gis platform multiple homogeneous simulation units are divided by overlaying the management layer meteorology layer and the soil layer each simulation unit has the same management type meteorology type and soil type then based on the single point aquacrop platform the prepared input data of all simulation units is used to establish the control file pro http www fao rog land water databases and software aquacrop en at last run the aquacrop plug in exe to get results in which the pro files are put in the input file http www fao org aquacrop based on statistical methods using actual observed field data to calibrate and verify the model mohamed sallah et al 2019 use the relative error re statistical indicators and determined coefficient r2 to assess the differences between simulated values and observed values distributed aquacrop model can be further calibrated and validated which are

parameter sensitivity analysis parameter sensitivity analysis can effectively reduce data processing in model calibration and significantly improve work efficiency in this study the extended fourier amplitude test efast was used to analyze the sensitivity parameters efast is a global sensitivity analysis method based on variance decomposition widely used in various crop models in this method the sensitivity index of each parameter is obtained by decomposing the simulation results variance zhu et al 2021 the greater the parameter s sensitivity index the greater the parameter influences the model s output results four parameters with the highest sensitivity index were selected as parameters to be corrected chibarabada et al 2020 2 3 3 batch processing of parameter calibration due to a

f x 2 f x d based on sklar s theorem the copula function is the joint distribution function of the marginal distribution of multiple random variables and its definition domain is 0 1 the formula is as eq 13 dong et al 2021 wang et al 2020 12 h x 1 x 2 x d c θ f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d where c is the copula function θ is the function parameter the joint probability distribution model of water resource supply and demand is established with the statistical probability and probability distribution characteristics of precipitation and et0 then the copula function is introduced to simulate the joint distribution set x and y as random variables of et0 and precipitation its joint distribution function is h x y and marginal distribution functions are f x x and f y y then there is joint function coupula c satisfying h x y c f x x f y y generalized extreme value gev and generalized normal gno are used to simulate the marginal distribution the copula function variables interdependent structure and marginal distribution can be considered independently to apply superior advantages variable correlation functions include frank clayton and gumbel hougaard coupula functions using the kolmogorov smirnov test and the minimum criterion for the sum of squares of deviations ols the copula function was further optimized the steps to select the copula function are as follows 1 using the hydrological frequency analysis method and selecting random variables corresponding probability distribution function the marginal distribution function of precipitation and et0 was obtained by simulation analysis and the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to carry out the fitting test 2 three correlation statistical analysis methods including pearson correlation coefficient kendall rank correlation coefficient and spearman rank correlation coefficient were used to quantify the correlation between precipitation and et0 3 correlation index method was used to estimate unknown parameters of the two dimensional archimedean copula function and the maximum likelihood method was used to estimate parameters of the copula function 4 kolmogorov smirnov test was used for each joint probability distribution function the minimum deviation sum of squares criterion ols and aic information criterion were used to select the copula function with the highest fitting degree assume both precipitation and et0 had three hydrological characteristics wet normal and dry using assurance rate and anomaly percentage can divide the conditions of wet normal and dry in this study the assurance rate is adopted to separate the dry condition and wet condition the cumulative probability of dry conditions was p f 62 5 and the cumulative probability of wet conditions was the frequency was

solution with regular irrigation order the modified initial solution is used for crossover and mutation the penalty function is used to reduce the fitness of irrigation date confusion caused by genetic manipulation and the ideal result of irrigation schedule optimization is obtained the final form of penalty function p and fitness function is as eqs 15 and 16 17 p 1000 u 1 n s s 2 18 f i t n e s s y p d u d v 0 d u d v u v u v n where s represents the sorted date vector and the meanings of other symbols are the same as above for the genetic algorithm the larger the population the more genetic algebra the more accurate the optimization results but the higher the calculation cost after weighing the calculation accuracy and efficiency in this paper 50 individuals were used for the optimization results after 500 generations of inheritance in this paper multi objective optimization decision of irrigation schedule is realized on matlab platform 1 the aquacrop model with a fixed rate is called in matlab 2 input the corresponding irrigation schdule file to simulate the crop growth condition and read the obtained yield and total irrigation amount into matlab 3 build a multi objective simulation optimization of irrigation schedule based on aquacrop and nsga ⅱ and solve the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis and simulation accuracy of distributed aquacrop model when other non sensitive parameters are fixed the sensitive parameters to be calibrated are initialized with reference values provided in fao crop reference manual add a tree to calculate the objective function so that the simulation results are closest to the statistics when the maximum number of iterations is reached or the objective function does not decrease for more consecutive iterations it is ended the simulation results were fitted with the statistical results and the normalized root means square error nrmse of the two was used as the evaluation index of the model calibration it is generally believed that when the nrmse is less than 10 it is excellent between 10 and 20 is good between 20 and 30 is acceptable greater than 30 indicates that the fitting result is unsatisfactory after the model calibration the calibrated parameter combination is input into the model to simulate each simulation unit s crop yield and then fit the statistical data the crop evaluation index of the determination coefficient r2 was used to test the simulation results the four sensitivity parameters are minimum effective rooting depth m maximum effective rooting depth m maximum canopy cover in fraction soil cover and the reference harvest index the model calibration results were 27 656 standard parameter sets of simulation units the slope r2 and nrmse of linear regression results were used to verify the accuracy by comparing each simulation unit s simulated and statistical yield after parameter calibration the results are shown in table 2 and fig 3 the nrmse of the simulation results from 2009 to 2013 was less than 0 3 showing promising results take 2012 and 2013 as examples and the scattered points were concentrated near the 1 1 line indicating that the yield simulated by the crop model was close to the actual yield on the whole the accuracy of model calibration reaches the expected level crop yields in the study area ranged from 3 to 10ton hm2 the western part of heilongjiang province and the northern part of jilin province has a higher yield the simulation results of heilongjiang province are more accurate and the relative error is minor tables 3 and 4 the accuracy of crop model calibration and validation is usually affected by many factors such as the calibration unit sample number model input data etc in the existing large scale studies model calibration usually takes large natural areas as the basic calibration unit according to the first law of geography a large basic calibration unit cannot guarantee homogenization in the same region which will lead to significant errors in the simulation results therefore this study adopted the simulation unit as the basic calibration unit of the crop model which effectively improved the geographical environment s similarity within the same calibration unit thus enhancing its simulation accuracy in addition to selecting basic calibration units some other factors may affect model parameter calibration accuracy in this study four sensitive parameters were chosen for calibration but other non sensitive parameters also influenced the simulation results simultaneously due to the extensive research scale the accuracy of field management data such as irrigation fertilization pesticide land cover etc is affected to a certain extent leading to simulation results besides the neglect of crop parameters among different maize varieties may also be one source of model calibration uncertainty in this study administrative divisions were used as the basic unit partly for irrigation policy management in addition the standard of parameter correction is corn yield per unit area and the data is easier to obtain from the statistical yearbook in this study the original data such as climate and soil were preprocessed and unified to counties through resampling since the county area is already minimal differences in internal climate and soil can not be considered in this study we went through many previous studies especially those on a larger scale such as global and national ones found the model correction is based on the basic unit of country and region therefore it is feasible to take the county as a correction unit in this paper 3 2 simulation of the marginal distribution function there are 13 irrigation zones in northeast china as is shown in fig 2 e as can be seen from the simulation results of 3 1 there is little difference in crop yield at the county scale therefore it can be analyzed and optimized with a county unit when studying the irrigation schedule select a specific site for each irrigation zone as shown in fig 4 the annual et0 has a small change while the annual precipitation has a significant difference with et0 therefore it is meaningful to calculate et0 and precipitation under different combination scenarios the calculation results of the harbin station are analyzed as an example the hydrological frequency analysis method is used to select the appropriate probability distribution function of random variables the precipitation followed the normal distribution and the reference crop transpiration et0 followed the generalized extreme distribution according to the calculation results the theoretical distribution functions of et0 and precipitation are roughly the same as the empirical distribution functions see fig 5 so it can be assumed that it is reasonable for precipitation and et0 to follow the cumulative probability density distribution model use pearson correlation coefficient γ kendall rank correlation coefficient τ and spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ to measure the correlation of precipitation and the et0 simulate to get the marginal distribution function of precipitation and et0 and the marginal distribution function parameter values are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that there is a negative correlation between precipitation and et0 therefore the copula function can construct the joint distribution model of water resources supply and demand to describe water resources supply and demand characteristics two dimensional symmetric archime dean models frank clayton gumball hougaard copula function were used to construct the joint probability distribution model of precipitation and et0 the kolmogorov smirnov k s test was used to test the statistical d values all less than the critical value therefore all the copula functions can be used to construct joint probability distribution function models the copula function s fitting degree was tested by the sum of deviation squares ols minimum criterion which were 0 17 0 19 and 0 18 respectively the joint distribution of annual precipitation and et0 under the joint distribution model established by the frank copula function is well fitted and the correlation between precipitation and et0 is well simulated combined distribution probabilities under different scenarios of precipitation and et0 were divided into the following categories precipitation exceeding a specific value of 662 5 mm and precipitation not exceeding a particular value of 563 1 mm et0 exceeds a specific value of 867 mm and does not exceed a specific value of 812 mm analyze the frequency of precipitation and et0 wet dry scenarios and there were nine types of wet dry encounters as shown in fig 5 e 3 3 analysis of yield water consumption and wue under different situations according to the simulation results each typical station has a different performance under the existing irrigation schedule under different situations the crop yield and wue of some stations changed significantly as shown in fig 6 a d e etc the maximum and minimum yield difference was 22 for harbin 32 for heihe and 21 for dunhua insufficient irrigation led to yield fluctuations this fluctuation is mainly due to the irrigation amount in some scenarios that do not meet crop water requirements other stations showed minor crop yield indicators possibly because the current irrigation schedule has enough irrigation water amount to allow the crop to reach its potential yield but in this case there is a potential for the waste of water therefore it is necessary to optimize the irrigation schedule 3 4 optimization of irrigation schedule harbin station is taken as an example to analyze the optimization results according to the actual local situation the irrigation time is three during the whole growth period the optimization results are shown in fig 7 the optimized irrigation water amount shows different performances under different scenarios after optimization the yield gap between different scenarios became smaller indicating that water stress was eliminated after increasing the irrigation amount as shown in fig 7 b except for the wue in the dw scenario the yield and wue difference in all scenarios are positive indicating that the irrigation schedule optimization is effective as shown in fig 7 c the first optimal irrigation time in each scenario was between 54 and 62 the second optimal irrigation time was between 68 and 83 and the third optimal irrigation time was between 85 and 97 it shows that the optimal irrigation time is different in different scenarios as shown in fig 7 d the optimal irrigation water amount for the first time is between 28 and 48 the optimal irrigation water amount for the second time is between 32 and 52 the optimal irrigation water amount for the third time is between 27 and 65 indicating that the optimal irrigation water amount is also different in different scenarios different decision makers make different decisions on different grounds and with different goals as far as crop production is concerned practitioners can be divided into farmers and ranchers the most significant difference between the two types lies in the scale of operation and capital input ranchers operations are large and all the means of production are put into agricultural production farmers are different especially after they choose to work in the city ranchers are still pursuing more excellent net benefits based on satisfying food and clothing farmers hope that the grain they produce can save time and labor as much as possible to provide more time to work in cities therefore in future studies optimization models for different users need to be built crop growth simulation models usually have complex calculation processes and high nonlinearity in addition the crop models are typically packaged software and require a specific file format traditional irrigation schedule optimization methods such as the dynamic planning method are no longer applicable the evolutionary algorithm based on the genetic algorithm can overcome the shortcomings of traditional optimization methods and is widely used to optimize irrigation schedules with the deepening of the research the optimization of irrigation schedules has also evolved from maximizing yield or net benefit to solve the complex multi objective optimization problem adeboye et al 2020 generally speaking there is a conflicted relationship between multiple objectives and there is no absolute optimal solution but pareto optimal solution one method for solving multi objective optimization is the pre announced class according to the preference information multiple objectives can be transformed into a comprehensive goal jin et al 2020 thus the multi objective problem can be transformed into a single objective problem the optimization problems can be solved using the single objective optimization model but the shortcoming is that it cannot face decision makers with different preferences in this case a multi objective genetic algorithm can get many non inferior solutions and then made decisions among many multi objective genetic algorithms nsga ⅱ is widely used maximum crop yield and minimum irrigation amount are the two primary objectives the relationship between the total amount of irrigation and the yield can be obtained when solving the two objectives this relationship is defined as the optimal water production function however most of the studies directly show the obtained water production function to the decision makers and the research on the decision part is relatively rough therefore the aquacrop model and non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ⅱ were combined in this paper to build a multi objective simulation optimization model of irrigation schedule and the efficiency coefficient method was used to make decisions on the optimization results li et al 2021 2018 4 conclusion 1 this paper takes northeast china as the research object divides simulation units based on gis and establishes distributed crop model based on the data from 2004 to 2013 the crop model was calibrated and verified the model is batch calibrated using xgboost which enables the large scale operation of multiple simulation units the results show that the model can simulate the growth of corn in northeast china crop yields in the study area ranged from 3 to 10ton hm2 the western part of heilongjiang province and the northern part of jilin province has a higher yield the simulation results of heilongjiang province are more accurate the relative error is minor 2 take precipitation and et0 of the typical stations in 13 irrigation zones from 1958 to 2013 as the research objects the correlation between water resources random variables was analyzed with correlation indexes and there was a negative correlation between the two the maximum likelihood method of the marginal distribution function is used to estimate parameters the copula function is used to construct a joint distribution model under different dry and wet combinations the model is applied to analyze the combined joint probability of the corresponding shortage risk the frank copula function can better fit the theoretical and empirical joint distribution of precipitation and et0 in northeast china the joint probability distribution model can describe different combination events better and quantitatively analyze various scenarios in irrigation areas wd and dw are the most unfavorable conditions for irrigation schedule among the nine combination encounters 3 according to the simulation of crop yield et and wue in 13 irrigation zones in northeast china the existing irrigation schedule can not fully use water resources and achieve the maximum yield the crop yield and wue of some stations changed significantly as shown in fig 6 a d e etc the maximum and minimum yield difference was 22 for harbin 32 for heihe and 21 for dunhua therefore it is necessary to optimize the irrigation schedule 4 crop growth simulation model has a complex calculation process and high nonlinearity evolutionary algorithms based on the genetic algorithm can overcome the shortcomings of traditional optimization methods therefore it can be widely used to optimize irrigation systems the results showed the crop yield and wue under different scenarios were improved significantly after optimization wn dn and dd scenarios increased the most declaration of competing interest

9931,in recent years as drought intensifies and agricultural water consumption increases it is of great significance to optimize the irrigation schedule to ensure regional food security this paper constructs the distributed aquacrop model and multi objective genetic algorithm nsga ⅱ simulation optimization mgso model to facilitate the development of a rational irrigation schedule the distributed aquacrop model considers the spatial variability of soil climate crops and management practices which can be batch calibrated using the xgboost method the mgso model is for irrigation schedules under the combination of different precipitation and et0 in this paper crop yield et and water use efficiency wue were simulated and analyzed in 13 irrigation zones in northeast china where the existing irrigation schedules were analyzed and optimized the results showed that the distributed aquacrop model could simulate regional crops well crop yields in the study area ranged from 3 to 10ton hm2 the western part of heilongjiang province and the northern part of jilin province has a higher yield the simulation results of heilongjiang province are more accurate and the relative error is minor the joint distribution model constructed by the frank copula function can describe the joint probability distribution characteristics of precipitation and et0 according to the simulation results each typical station has a different performance under the existing irrigation schedule under different situations the crop yield and wue of some stations changed significantly the maximum and minimum yield difference was 22 for harbin 32 for heihe and 21 for dunhua it is mainly due to the irrigation amount in some scenarios that do not meet crop water requirements under the optimized irrigation schedule the crop yield and wue in different scenarios have been improved by the mgso model in the harbin station graphical abstract ga1 keywords distributed aquacrop model optimization of irrigation schedule joint probability bach processing 1 introduction water scarcity is an important socio economic and global sustainability issue hoque et al 2021 wei et al 2021 which leads to the increasing contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources at the same time the available water for agricultural irrigation gradually reduced it is of great significance to establish a sound irrigation schedule to improve agricultural water use efficiency wue and promote sustainable agricultural development chen et al 2021 sexton et al 2021 st aime et al 2021 traditionally the establishment of an irrigation schedule is based on precipitation of different level years however irrigation amount is determined by precipitation and reference crop evaporation et0 during the growth period wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 therefore it is essential to analyze and optimize irrigation schedules in different regions under different situations divided by the joint distribution of precipitation and et0 irrigation schedule optimization is essential to rationally establish an irrigation schedule delgoda et al 2017 li et al 2019 its core idea is to determine how to allocate limited water in the growth period of crops to achieve maximum crop yield or maximum benefit abrishambaf et al 2020 alonso campos et al 2020 irrigation schedule optimization methods mainly include linear programming nonlinear programming and dynamic programming most water resources optimization allocation is under the scale of the whole growth period month and the ten day li et al 2005 however due to the simple consideration of the evapotranspiration process and its influence on crop yield these methods are difficult to reflect the yield changes under different irrigation conditions objectively it is difficult to determine the specific irrigation dates the crop growth simulation model can simulate crop yield changes under different irrigation conditions combining the simulation model with the optimization model to optimize the crop irrigation schedule can effectively solve the above problems crop models can effectively estimate crop water consumption yield and wue nowadays dssat ma et al 2020 epic qiao et al 2018 and wofost de wit et al 2019 are the most generally used crop models growth status and water consumption of the crops at the field scale can be simulated accurately however compared with the aquacrop model they are more complex han et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 just s few input parameters can meet the aquacrop model s demand which is more straightforward intuitive and easy to obtain the aquacrop model is developed rapidly and can be applied worldwide because of its applicability to various crops the aquacrop model has been used in many experiments and researches on optimizing irrigation management measures and predicting crop yield under climate change its application has been pervasive and mature new progressive models have been established based on gis development by which spatial variation of regional factors such as soil climate crop type and irrigation can be analyzed as a result spatially distributed models have been developed such as the swap model zhao et al 2020 the swap epic model xu et al 2016 swap wofost model hu et al 2019 and the hydrus epic model spatial variation of crop growing is considered in these distributed models to improve the simulation accuracy however they have a strict requirement on parameter calibration and input data preparation limiting their applications under which circumstances simple distributed models should be developed therefore in this study 1 distributed aquacrop model was established based on batch processing parameter calibration 2 copula function was used to quantify the two dimensional joint probability distribution model of precipitation and et0 to analyze the combination of dry and wet conditions in different regions 3 irrigation schedules under different conditions were analyzed and optimized by nsga ⅱmethod 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the problem a reasonable irrigation schedule is of great significance in improving regional agricultural wue and promoting sustainable agricultural development the crop model can describe crop growth and development processes more comprehensively compared with the water production function therefore the crop model performs better in analyzing and optimizing the irrigation schedule the spatial heterogeneity of soil climate crop and management measures is considered in the distributed crop model which can accurately simulate regional crop growth by embedding an independent model in each simulation unit the model s input and output data are managed uniformly and the regional simulation of the model is realized precipitation and et0 are two important hydrological variables in the irrigation schedule the irrigation schedule needs to consider the combined effects of precipitation and et0 the copula function is used to fit the two dimensional joint probability distribution model of precipitation and et0 which can be closer to the actual situation and make the analysis and optimization of the irrigation schedule more comprehensive does this paper mainly answer the following questions 1 how to build a distributed crop model and simulate it on a large scale 2 how does the existing irrigation schedule perform under different dry and wet combination scenarios of et0 and precipitation 3 how to optimize the irrigation schedule in different scenarios 2 2 study area and data collection the study area consists of three provinces in northeast china including liaoning jilin and heilongjiang the three provinces geographical location in northeast china is 38 54 n and 118 5 135 e the highest latitude in china the study area belongs to the temperate monsoon climate due to the higher latitudes the winters are long and cold and the summers are warm and short the study area is mainly in the middle temperate zone and a few in the cold and warm temperate zones the annual average temperature is 3 8 11 3 and the temperature increases gradually from north to south the annual precipitation are 368 1064 mm the annual frost free period is 140 170d zhang et al 2020 fig 1 the aquacrop crop model s input data mainly includes four parts meteorological data soil data crop data and management data table 1 meteorological data is from the china meteorological data service center including average temperature daily minimum temperature daily maximum temperature precipitation water vapor pressure average wind speed etc soil data are from china s 1 1 million soil database mainly soil texture soil organic matter content and soil profile crop data these mainly covered the parameters of growth and development such as canopy coverage root growth and growth season evaporation and transpiration yield formation and stress the growth season was directly obtained from the decade dataset of crop growth and development and soil moisture in china the sensitive parameters were obtained from model calibration while non sensitive parameters were obtained from the reference values of the crop model

were obtained from the rural statistical yearbook and statistical yearbook management data are taken from china irrigation and drainage center and model default values they mainly included irrigation fertilization and surface coverage fig 2 shows the geographical location distribution of meteorological stations farmland soil type irrigation zoning and typical counties 2 3 distributed aquacrop model 2 3 1 the establishment of distributed aquacrop model aquacrop is a crop growth model developed by fao in 2009 er raki et al 2021 it is a water driven model that affects crop yields controlled by the amount of soil water content the model mainly contains three primary modules of crop growth atmospheric components and soil water balance fao irrigation and drainage document no 33 gives the conversion relationship between crop yield and water response as shown in eq 1 1 y x y 0 y x k y e t x e t 0 e t x where y x is potential yield kg m2 y 0 is actual yield kg m2 e t x is potential evapotranspiration mm e t 0 is actual evapotranspiration mm k y is coefficient of yield response to water the equations of the aquacrop model are improved the evapotranspiration equations are divided into soil evaporation and crop transpiration it avoids the confusion between the effects of non productive water soil evaporation and productive water crop transpiration the final yield was expressed as biomass and harvest index to highlight the impact of water stress the improved formula is as follows 2 y b h i 3 b w p t r the final crop yield kg m2 b is biomass kg m2 is harvest index w p is biomass wue kg m2 mm t r is crop transpiration mm according to the principle and operation of aquacrop training handbooks based on the aquacrop model at a single scale the distributed aquacrop model is established the steps of establishing distributed aquacrop model are as follows at first based on the gis platform multiple homogeneous simulation units are divided by overlaying the management layer meteorology layer and the soil layer each simulation unit has the same management type meteorology type and soil type then based on the single point aquacrop platform the prepared input data of all simulation units is used to establish the control file pro http www fao rog land water databases and software aquacrop en at last run the aquacrop plug in exe to get results in which the pro files are put in the input file http www fao org aquacrop based on statistical methods using actual observed field data to calibrate and verify the model mohamed sallah et al 2019 use the relative error re statistical indicators and determined coefficient r2 to assess the differences between simulated values and observed values distributed aquacrop model can be further calibrated and validated which are shown as follows 4 re y o b s y s i m y o b s 100 5 r 2 1 i 1 n y s i m y s i m 2 i 1 n y o b s y o b s 2 the observed value of yield y s i m is the simulated value of yield n is the number of the experimental value if the r 2 is larger than 0 6 and r e less than 20 it can indicate that the established distributed aquacrop model can reasonably simulate and forecast the yield xu et al 2019 2 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis parameter sensitivity analysis can effectively reduce data processing in model calibration and significantly improve work efficiency in this study the extended fourier amplitude test efast was used to analyze the sensitivity parameters efast is a global sensitivity analysis method based on variance decomposition widely used in various crop models in this method the sensitivity index of each parameter is obtained by decomposing the simulation results variance zhu et al 2021 the greater the parameter s sensitivity index the greater the parameter influences the model s output results four parameters with the highest sensitivity index were selected as parameters to be corrected chibarabada et al 2020 2 3 3 batch processing of parameter calibration due to a large number of simulation units the xgboost method is used for model calibration xgboost is a machine learning algorithm realized by gradient lifting technology and its base classifier is a

f x 2 f x d based on sklar s theorem the copula function is the joint distribution function of the marginal distribution of multiple random variables and its definition domain is 0 1 the formula is as eq 13 dong et al 2021 wang et al 2020 12 h x 1 x 2 x d c θ f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d where c is the copula function θ is the function parameter the joint probability distribution model of water resource supply and demand is established with the statistical probability and probability distribution characteristics of precipitation and et0 then the copula function is introduced to simulate the joint distribution set x and y as random variables of et0 and precipitation its joint distribution function is h x y and marginal distribution functions are f x x and f y y then there is joint function coupula c satisfying h x y c f x x f y y generalized extreme value gev and generalized normal gno are used to simulate the marginal distribution the copula function variables interdependent structure and marginal distribution can be considered independently to apply superior advantages variable correlation functions include frank clayton and gumbel hougaard coupula functions using the kolmogorov smirnov test and the minimum criterion for the sum of squares of deviations ols the copula function was further optimized the steps to select the copula function are as follows 1 using the hydrological frequency analysis method and selecting random variables corresponding probability distribution function the marginal distribution function of precipitation and et0 was obtained by simulation analysis and the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to carry out the fitting test 2 three correlation statistical analysis methods including pearson correlation coefficient kendall rank correlation coefficient and spearman rank correlation coefficient were used to quantify the correlation between precipitation and et0 3 correlation index method was used to estimate unknown parameters of the two dimensional archimedean copula function and the maximum likelihood method was used to estimate parameters of the copula function 4 kolmogorov smirnov test was used for each joint probability distribution function the minimum deviation sum of squares criterion ols and aic information criterion were used to select the copula function with the highest fitting degree assume both precipitation and et0 had three hydrological characteristics wet normal and dry using assurance rate and anomaly percentage can divide the conditions of wet normal and dry in this study the assurance rate is adopted to separate the dry condition and wet condition the cumulative probability of dry conditions was p f 62 5 and the cumulative probability of wet conditions was the frequency was

irrigation the decision variable is the irrigation date and irrigation amount each time wang et al 2021 the optimization objectives are as eqs 13 and 14 13 max y f s t 14 min w v 1 n t v the constraints 15 s u s u 1 u n 1 u n 16 t min t u t max v n v n where y is crop yield t hm2 depending on irrigation schedule simulated by aquacrop model s s 1 s 2 s n is a sequence of vectors of irrigation date s u u 1 2 n n is irrigation time t t 1 t 2 t n is irrigation amount w is irrigation quota mm t min t max are the maximum and minimum irrigation amount mm this paper uses the modified non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ⅱ for solving the optimization model guo et al 2021 the algorithm consists of six steps population initialization non dominated sorting crowding distance calculation selection crossover and mutation recombination and selection this study randomly generated the initial irrigation schedule first it then sorted the irrigation date to develop an initial solution with regular irrigation order the modified initial solution is used for crossover and mutation the penalty function is used to reduce the fitness of irrigation date confusion caused by genetic manipulation and the ideal result of irrigation schedule optimization is obtained the final form of penalty function p and fitness function is as eqs 15 and 16 17 p 1000 u 1 n s s 2 18 f i t n

genetic algebra the more accurate the optimization results but the higher the calculation cost after weighing the calculation accuracy and efficiency in this paper 50 individuals were used for the optimization results after 500 generations of inheritance in this paper multi objective optimization decision of irrigation schedule is realized on matlab platform 1 the aquacrop model with a fixed rate is called in matlab 2 input the corresponding irrigation schdule file to simulate the crop growth condition and read the obtained yield and total irrigation amount into matlab 3 build a multi objective simulation optimization of irrigation schedule based on aquacrop and nsga ⅱ and solve the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis and simulation accuracy of distributed aquacrop model when other non sensitive parameters are fixed the sensitive parameters to be calibrated are initialized with reference values provided in fao crop reference manual add a tree to calculate the objective function so that the simulation results are closest to the statistics when the maximum number of iterations is reached or the objective function does not decrease for more consecutive iterations it is ended the simulation results were fitted with the statistical results and the normalized root means square error nrmse of the two was used as the evaluation index of the model calibration it is generally believed that when the nrmse is less than 10 it is excellent between 10 and 20 is good between 20 and 30 is acceptable greater than 30 indicates that the fitting result is unsatisfactory after the model calibration the calibrated parameter combination is input into the model to simulate each simulation unit s crop yield and then fit the statistical data the crop evaluation index of the determination coefficient r2 was used to test the simulation results the four sensitivity parameters are minimum effective rooting depth m maximum effective rooting depth m maximum canopy cover in fraction soil cover and the reference harvest index the model calibration results were 27 656 standard parameter sets of simulation units the slope r2 and nrmse of linear regression results were used to verify the accuracy by comparing each simulation unit s simulated and statistical yield after parameter calibration the results are shown in table 2 and fig 3 the nrmse of the simulation results from 2009 to 2013 was less than 0 3 showing promising results take 2012 and 2013 as examples and the scattered points were concentrated near the 1 1 line indicating that the yield simulated by the crop model was close to the actual yield on the whole the accuracy of model calibration reaches the expected level crop yields in the study area ranged from 3 to 10ton hm2 the western part of heilongjiang province and the northern part of jilin province has a higher yield the simulation results of heilongjiang province are more accurate and the relative error is minor tables 3 and 4 the accuracy of crop model calibration and validation is usually affected by many factors such as the calibration unit sample number model input data etc in the existing large scale studies model calibration usually takes large natural areas as the basic calibration unit according to the first law of geography a large basic calibration unit cannot guarantee homogenization in the same region which will lead to significant errors in the simulation results therefore this study adopted the simulation unit as the basic calibration unit of the crop model which effectively improved the geographical environment s similarity within the same calibration unit thus enhancing its simulation accuracy in addition to selecting basic calibration units some other factors may affect model parameter calibration accuracy in this study four sensitive parameters were chosen for calibration but other non sensitive parameters also influenced the simulation results simultaneously due to the extensive research scale the accuracy of field management data such as irrigation fertilization pesticide land cover etc is affected to a certain extent leading to simulation results besides the neglect of crop parameters among different maize varieties may also be one source of model calibration uncertainty in this study administrative divisions were used as the basic unit partly for irrigation policy management in addition the standard of parameter correction is corn yield per unit area and the data is easier to obtain from the statistical yearbook in this study the original data such as climate and soil were preprocessed and unified to counties through resampling since the county area is already minimal differences in internal climate and soil can not be considered in this study we went through many previous studies especially those on a larger scale such as global and national ones found the model correction is based on the basic unit of country and region therefore it is feasible to take the county as a correction unit in this paper 3 2 simulation of the marginal distribution function there are 13 irrigation zones in northeast china as is shown in fig 2 e as can be seen from the simulation results of 3 1 there is little difference in crop yield at the county scale therefore it can be analyzed and optimized with a county unit when studying the irrigation schedule select a specific site for each irrigation zone as shown in fig 4 the annual et0 has a small change while the annual precipitation has a significant difference with et0 therefore it is meaningful to calculate et0 and precipitation under different combination scenarios the calculation results of the harbin station are analyzed as an example the hydrological frequency analysis method is used to select the appropriate probability distribution function of random variables the precipitation followed the normal distribution and the reference crop transpiration et0 followed the generalized extreme distribution according to the calculation results the theoretical distribution functions of et0 and precipitation are roughly the same as the empirical distribution functions see fig 5 so it can be assumed that it is reasonable for precipitation and et0 to follow the cumulative probability density distribution model use pearson correlation coefficient γ kendall rank correlation coefficient τ and spearman rank correlation coefficient ρ to measure the correlation of precipitation and the et0 simulate to get the marginal distribution function of precipitation and et0 and the marginal distribution function parameter values are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that there is a negative correlation between precipitation and et0 therefore the copula function can construct the joint distribution model of water resources supply and demand to describe water resources supply and demand characteristics two dimensional symmetric archime dean models frank clayton gumball hougaard copula function were used to construct the joint probability distribution model of precipitation and et0 the kolmogorov smirnov k s test was used to test the statistical d values all less than the critical value therefore all the copula functions can be used to construct joint probability distribution function models the copula function s fitting degree was tested by the sum of deviation squares ols minimum criterion which were 0 17 0 19 and 0 18 respectively the joint distribution of annual precipitation and et0 under the joint distribution model established by the frank copula function is well fitted and the correlation between precipitation and et0 is well simulated combined distribution probabilities under different scenarios of precipitation and et0 were divided into the following categories precipitation exceeding a specific value of 662 5 mm and precipitation not exceeding a particular value of 563 1 mm et0 exceeds a specific value of 867 mm and does not exceed a specific value of 812 mm analyze the frequency of precipitation and et0 wet dry scenarios and there were nine types of wet dry encounters as shown in fig 5 e 3 3 analysis of yield water consumption and wue under different situations according to the simulation results each typical station has a different performance under the existing irrigation schedule under different situations the crop yield and wue of some stations changed significantly as shown in fig 6 a d e etc the maximum and minimum yield difference was 22 for harbin 32 for heihe and 21 for dunhua insufficient irrigation led to yield fluctuations this fluctuation is mainly due to the irrigation amount in some scenarios that do not meet crop water requirements other stations showed minor crop yield indicators possibly because the current irrigation schedule has enough irrigation water amount to allow the crop to reach its potential yield but in this case there is a potential for the waste of water therefore it is necessary to optimize the irrigation schedule 3 4 optimization of irrigation schedule harbin station is taken as an example to analyze the optimization results according to the actual local situation the irrigation time is three during the whole growth period the optimization results are shown in fig 7 the optimized irrigation water amount shows different performances under different scenarios after optimization the yield gap between different scenarios became smaller indicating that water stress was eliminated after increasing the irrigation amount as shown in fig 7 b except for the wue in the dw scenario the yield and wue difference in all scenarios are positive indicating that the irrigation schedule optimization is effective as shown in fig 7 c the first optimal irrigation time in each scenario was between 54 and 62 the second optimal irrigation time was between 68 and 83 and the third optimal irrigation time was between 85 and 97 it shows that the optimal irrigation time is different in different scenarios as shown in fig 7 d the optimal irrigation water amount for the first time is between 28 and 48 the optimal irrigation water amount for the second time is between 32 and 52 the optimal irrigation water amount for the third time is between 27 and 65 indicating that the optimal irrigation water amount is also different in different scenarios different decision makers make different decisions on different grounds and with different goals as far as crop production is concerned practitioners can be divided into farmers and ranchers the most significant difference between the two types lies in the scale of operation and capital input ranchers operations are large and all the means of production are put into agricultural production farmers are different especially after they choose to work in the city ranchers are still pursuing more excellent net benefits based on satisfying food and clothing farmers hope that the grain they produce can save time and labor as much as possible to provide more time to work in cities therefore in future studies optimization models for different users need to be built crop growth simulation models usually have complex calculation processes and high nonlinearity in addition the crop models are typically packaged software and require a specific file format traditional irrigation schedule optimization methods such as the dynamic planning method are no longer applicable the evolutionary algorithm based on the genetic algorithm can overcome the shortcomings of traditional optimization methods and is widely used to optimize irrigation schedules with the deepening of the research the optimization of irrigation schedules has also evolved from maximizing yield or net benefit to solve the complex multi objective optimization problem adeboye et al 2020 generally speaking there is a conflicted relationship between multiple objectives and there is no absolute optimal solution but pareto optimal solution one method for solving multi objective optimization is the pre announced class according to the preference information multiple objectives can be transformed into a comprehensive goal jin et al 2020 thus the multi objective problem can be transformed into a single objective problem the optimization problems can be solved using the single objective optimization model but the shortcoming is that it cannot face decision makers with different preferences in this case a multi objective genetic algorithm can get many non inferior solutions and then made decisions among many multi objective genetic algorithms nsga ⅱ is widely used maximum crop yield and minimum irrigation amount are the two primary objectives the relationship between the total amount of irrigation and the yield can be obtained when solving the two objectives this relationship is defined as the optimal water production function however most of the studies directly show the obtained water production function to the decision makers and the research on the decision part is relatively rough therefore the aquacrop model and non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ⅱ were combined in this paper to build a multi objective simulation optimization model of irrigation schedule and the efficiency coefficient method was used to make decisions on the optimization results li et al 2021 2018 4 conclusion 1 this paper takes northeast china as the research object divides simulation units based on gis and establishes distributed crop model based on the data from 2004 to 2013 the crop model was calibrated and verified the model is batch calibrated using xgboost which enables the large scale operation of multiple simulation units the results show that the model can simulate the growth of corn in northeast china crop yields in the study area ranged from 3 to 10ton hm2 the western part of heilongjiang province and the northern part of jilin province has a higher yield the simulation results of heilongjiang province are more accurate the relative error is minor 2 take precipitation and et0 of the typical stations in 13 irrigation zones from 1958 to 2013 as the research objects the correlation between water resources random variables was analyzed with correlation indexes and there was a negative correlation between the two the maximum likelihood method of the marginal distribution function is used to estimate parameters the copula function is used to construct a joint distribution model under different dry and wet combinations the model is applied to analyze the combined joint probability of the corresponding shortage risk the frank copula function can better fit the theoretical and empirical joint distribution of precipitation and et0 in northeast china the joint probability distribution model can describe different combination events better and quantitatively analyze various scenarios in irrigation areas wd and dw are the most unfavorable conditions for irrigation schedule among the nine combination encounters 3 according to the simulation of crop yield et and wue in 13 irrigation zones in northeast china the existing irrigation schedule can not fully use water resources and achieve the maximum yield the crop yield and wue of some stations changed significantly as shown in fig 6 a d e etc the maximum and minimum yield difference was 22 for harbin 32 for heihe and 21 for dunhua therefore it is necessary to optimize the irrigation schedule 4 crop growth simulation model has a complex calculation process and high nonlinearity evolutionary algorithms based on the genetic algorithm can overcome the shortcomings of traditional optimization methods therefore it can be widely used to optimize irrigation systems the results showed the crop yield and wue under different scenarios were improved significantly after optimization wn dn and dd scenarios increased the most declaration of competing interest

9932,a pilot equipment aquemfree was developed and tested for the remediation and reuse of agro wastewater with pesticides derived from the remnants cleaning and rinse of phytosanitary equipment and packaging through a photocatalytic process using tio2 na2s2o8 and sunlight the purpose of this work is the assessment of the economic sustainability of the aquemfree system studying four pilot devices on representative farms of mediterranean crops and their impact on the cost structure of each crop two cases per farm were established pilot devices equipped with a 200 l aquemfree 200 or a 400 l aquemfree 400 reaction tank pesticide degradation varied between 82 4 and 97 8 as for financial assessment the large importance of the fixed costs 81 involves a faster amortisation for a higher frequency of use whose maximisation depends on radiation threshold 30 cycles per year financial indicators related to the equipment capacity show cost reductions of 31 for the bigger device verifying the economies of scale the impact of the system use involves a low increase 0 24 0 05 of the crop production costs corresponding fewer values to crops with higher production costs the potential farm area of application of an aquemfree 200 device is very large 160 ha for trees and 53 63 6 ha for greenhouses and doubled by aquemfree 400 in conclusion aquemfree has a high remediation performance and a low financial impact on intensive crop production costs due to its economies of scale it is recommended the use of higher capacity devices either for big farms or to be shared by several farmers establishing a combination of a portable compact device and wastewater storing tanks in the farms keywords pesticides agro wastewater reuse solar photocatalysis pilot plant financial assessment 1 introduction the assessment of the economic sustainability is a paramount requirement to carry out business operations for a new product or process besides the assessment of the environmental sustainability is a strategic instrument to increase its value in relation to the rising environmental awareness during the last decades barber et al 2009 consumers have introduced the environmental concern as an important factor in their purchase processes showing preference for those products showing environmental sensitivity barber et al 2009 and causing the corresponding market reaction to this demand thus the setting up of sustainable production patterns based on socioeconomic and environmental criteria is a fundamental strategy to achieve the objective of a viable and competitive agricultural activity there is a need to establish productive systems for sustainable crops encouraging the quality of the production and working methods with favourable effects on the population and the rural world in the social economic and environmental scopes with a circular economy approach garcía and garcía 2018 voulvoulis 2018 the use of plant protection products also called phytosanitary products or pesticides has been determinant for the increase of food production in the last century from an agronomical perspective it is ideal that those substances persist for a time enough to control pests and diseases however a longer persistence involves a higher risk of environmental pollution along with the environmental problems associated to the use of pesticides persistence and accumulation in soils mobility between environmental compartments production of intermediate compounds the highest concern comes from their presence in food products and the effects on consumer health this social demand has promoted the formulation of legal instruments underpinning the control and regulation of such substances limiting the adverse effects of their use the directive 2009 128 ec of the european parliament and of the council of 21 october 2009 establishing a framework for community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides european commission 2009 obliges members states to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the operations by professional users and where applicable by distributors do not endanger human health or the environment regarding remnants of pesticides tank mixtures remaining after application and cleaning of the equipment used after application the directive only offers vague recommendations for a proper management of these residues although some countries such as france requires from farmers the use of authorised systems ministère du l écologie de déloppemenr durable et de l énergie 2015 however most of these systems offer an incomplete solution because there is a transfer of the problem from water to soil or to a waste plant and an incomplete degradation generating new residues felsot et al 2003 garrido et al 2020a new technologies have been launched in the las decade devoted to the remediation of polluted water by anthropogenic activities allowing its reuse which is of particular importance in regions with high irrigation demand and scarce water resources many recent studies are targeted to develop oxidation procedures of persistent organic compounds in aquatic environments these advanced oxidation processes are based on catalytic and photochemical procedures to cause deep changes in the pollutant structure through the generation of free radicals and reacting with the contaminants by their complete mineralisation maldonado et al 2007 among them the most used technique is the heterogenous photocatalysis using semiconductor solids as photocatalysts capable to absorb direct or indirectly uv light in contact with water a series of oxidation and reduction reactions are produced on the catalyst surface finalising with the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh which are very oxidant and little selective species and can therefore produce the fast degradation of many organic compounds into carbon dioxide water and mineral salts fenoll et al 2013 heterogenous photocatalysis with solar radiation has been applied to wastewater from the cleaning and rinse of phytosanitary equipment for its remediation and reuse to irrigate a lettuce and pepper crops aliste et al 2020 2021 the results show an efficient and simple technology to regenerate and reuse large volume of agro wastewater polluted with pesticides for vegetables irrigation reducing the risk for human health and environment no significant differences were observed when comparing different quality parameters in lettuce and pepper grown using treated and non treated agro wastewater in this context this work was aimed to develop a viable solution for the remediation of the agro wastewater with pesticide residues derived from the remnants cleaning and rinse of phytosanitary equipment and packaging through a photocatalytic process using tio2 na2s2o8 and sunlight for this purpose a pilot device of the aquemfree system was developed built and installed in collaboration between researchers of imida and the engineering team of the company novedades agrícolas s a novagric first the different variables of the photocatalytic process were optimised with artificial light on a laboratory scale then the technique was applied through the equipment installed in four commercial farms chosen by their representativeness of different crops in se spain an optimal area for the study for its significant wide ranging agriculture and water demand resources conditions once the technical viability of the photocatalytic process was verified the implementation of the aquemfree system was subject of a socioeconomic assessment despite some works evaluate treatments applied to wastewater polluted by phytosanitary mixtures with an economic approach fenoll et al 2012 vela et al 2018 and even economic and environmental simultaneously giménez et al 2015 they do it on small tests at laboratory scale the use of a pilot plant scale provides useful information to be scaled up to farm situations as the basis for farmers to make information based decisions on the system viability and its impact on their crop cost effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 pesticides and reagents analytical standards 95 purity and commercial formulations of pesticides were supplied by dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany and fitodolores s l murcia spain respectively tio2 aeroxide p25 99 5 was obtained from nippon aerosil co ltd osaka japan na2s2o8 98 and nacl were provided by panreac química barcelona spain acetonitrile was purchased from scharlab barcelona spain 2 2 photoreaction setup at lab scale the optimisation of the influential parameters in the photocatalysis process was performed at laboratory scale using a photochemical reactor sbs barcelona spain the methodology followed and features of the equipment were previously described by fenoll et al 2013 with the purpose of optimising the type and concentration of catalyst and oxidant several essays were carried out with different reaction systems based on combinations between catalysts with or without oxidant agent 2 3 experimental setup at pilot plant scale the trial was performed in four commercial farms located in murcia se spain using a pilot plant cpc technology each one under natural sunlight irradiation during june and october 2017 fig 1 farm 1 latitude 37 26 26 8 n longitude 1 35 07 0 w elevation 116 m was dedicated to tomato and watermelon crops farm 2 latitude 37 46 25 7 n longitude 0 52 59 5 w elevation 25 m was dedicated to pepper artichoke and lettuce crops farm 3 latitude 38 06 44 4 n longitude 1 01 58 0 w elevation 113 m was dedicated to citrus fruits and farm 4 latitude 38º 16 53 n longitude 1º 27 23 w elevation 248 m was dedicated to stone fruit crops the farms were selected attending to different factors geographical situation management and cultivation intimately related with the residues generated in order to achieve a representative analysis of the problem tackled different photocatalytic treatments hereinafter cycles were carried out in each farm a small prototype aquemfree was used to carry out all photochemical processes under field conditions fig 1 the process is controlled by an automated electronic unit and starts when water coming from remnants and cleaning of the phytosanitary treatment equipment is passed through a sand filter and collected in a storage tank 1000 l a centrifugal pump impulses 0 26 kw the water from this tank to the reaction tank 180 l where the catalyst and oxidant agents are added and then to the photoreactor section 75 l in this section the water is exposed to sunlight irradiation while it circulates through four borosilicate tubes connected in series and come back to the reaction tank the system works in continuous mode making possible the recirculation of water 65 l min 1 during a selected period of time from 9 pm to 7 am it is thermostated 25 1 c by a cooler and continuously stirred to maintain a uniform slurry a photoradiometer was integrated to record values kjm 2 of uva 315 400 nm radiation in order to increase the incident irradiation the tubes were placed on a curved aluminium reflector with four different positions available depending on the season in which the cycle is going to be performed finally an ultra filtration membrane mann hummel u860 cartridge and a filtered water tank was incorporated to recover tio2 after treatments the trial was initiated with the addition of 300 mg l 1 of na2s2o8 and 300 mg l 1 of tio2 to the corresponding reaction tank during the photoperiod several samples were taken at regular intervals the experiments ended up when a value of 7000 kj m 2 of accumulated irradiation was reached 2 4 analytical determinations pesticide residues were isolated from water by liquid liquid extraction and analysed by hplc ms2 following the method published by fenoll et al 2011 analytical conditions for each compound have been reported in previous works aliste et al 2020 fenoll et al 2012 2019 garrido et al 2020a 2020b kushniarou et al 2019 vela et al 2019 a multi n c 3100 toc analyzer analytic jena ag jena germany equipped with an ndir detector 950 c was used to measure dissolved organic carbon doc content after sample filtration 0 45 µm 2 5 financial assessment the economic assessment of the aquemfree system is based on the analysis of its implementation in the current productive system as an alternative wastewater treatment in the farms for this purpose four standard commercial farms were selected representing different types of production lemon tree peach tree tomato under greenhouse and pepper under greenhouse for different scenarios the average costs of the system establishment and management were calculated to estimate their impact on the cost accounting of each crop established by garcía garcía 2018 2020 through economic and performance indicators a cost accounting methodology was used including fixed costs amortisation of equipment and variable costs maintenance and operating costs the economic assessment was based on the conventional cost analysis methods layard and glaister 1994 ballestero 2000 garcía garcía et al 2012 2013 romero azorín and garcía garcía 2020 fernández et al 2020 through several interviews with the engineering team of novagric and with the technical staff of the pilot farms the aquemfree system variables regarding maintenance and operation were established and the corresponding data were compiled as the basis for the financial assessment table 1 each one of the pilot devices installed in the farms was equipped with a 200 l reaction tank aquemfree 200 and another theoretical case device was defined with twice the capacity 400 l for aquemfree 400 in order to study possible economies of scale 2 5 1 investment and fixed costs characteristics an aquemfree device is considered as a complete compact product with a useful life of 12 16 years based on its components valves tanks electronics except for some smaller parts made of pvc or pe or pumps which are subjected to longer running periods in unfavourable conditions thus according to the engineering team of novagric the lifespan of the pumps was determined in 5 years and their replacement was included as part of the balancing item maintenance the useful life of the aquemfree system was established in 15 years and in 30 years for the concrete foundations amortisations were calculated by the linear or constant quotas method romero azorín and garcía garcía 2020 2 5 2 variable costs characteristics the variable costs are related to equipment maintenance catalyst oxidant electric power and operation and control labour based on the experimental results of the photocatalytic process the variables for the two cases aquemfree 200 and 400 were established the dose and price of catalyst and oxidant the average duration of a photocatalytic cycle and therefore a realistic number of cycles per year considering seasonality according to solar radiation operational data were obtained from the records and interviews with the technical staff of the farms wastewater volume to be treated after a plant health treatment operation labour time equipment control and controlled discharge or storage of the treated water and electric energy the catalyst was recovered by an ultrafiltration membrane to be reused three more times thus the catalyst was used in a total of 4 photocatalytic cycles 2 5 3 economic and performance indicators the values of some variables and the relation among them were used to display the economic dimension of the aquemfree system investment equipment volume this indicator shows the relationship between the investment value and the one cycle capacity volume of the device in l 1 to evaluate the economies of scale total annual cost the total cost per year of the aquemfree system for each studied case 200 and 400 l as the sum of fixed costs year 1 and variable costs year 1 unit total cost this indicator relates the total annual cost the sum of fixed and variable costs with the annual treated wastewater volume l 1 cycle unit cost cycle 1 this indicator reports the total annual cost of every treatment cycle it expresses the same concept than the preceding but related to one cycle 200 or 400 l other two indicators potential area ha and impact of the system use on the production cost were calculated regarding the farm characteristics for each crop type pilot farm stone fruit trees lemon trees open air vegetables and greenhouse vegetables for both indicators there is a major repercussion of the number of phytosanitary treatments which is in direct relation to the kind of crop the potential area expresses the crop surface to be potentially treated with the maximum volume of phytosanitary spray whose residues are likely to be treated by an aquemfree device in 1 year its calculation is made with the equation eq 1 1 crop surface ha a b xcx d e where a number of hours of a working day 8 h day 1 b performance of a phytosanitary treatment h treatment ha 1 c number of working days to fill in the aquemfree accumulation tank 4 days cycle 1 for aquemfree 200 d number of remediation cycles by an aquemfree device 30 cycles year 1 e number of phytosanitary treatments treatment year 1 the calculations were made for the model established by garcía garcía 2018 2020 phytosanitary treatments applied with a 90 cv tractor and a 2000 l tank including for every case the preparation idle and transport times and assuming a daily tank rinse the cleaning of 4 or 8 phytosanitary tanks are needed to refill one aquemfree reaction tank of 200 or 400 l capacity respectively table 1 the annual number of aquemfree remediation cycles 30 cycles year 1 was estimated considering their different length along the year according to the daylight the impact of the system use on the production costs for the different crops was calculated as the overrun involved by the aquemfree use on the cost accounting of each crop garcía garcía 2018 2020 both in absolute and in relative values 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation experiments in situ at field scale before starting trials in pilot plants under natural irradiation the optimal concentrations of tio2 and na2s2o8 were determined at laboratory scale following the methodology described by fenoll et al 2019 a value of 300 mg l 1 was selected for both reagents what is in concordance with results obtained in other works fenoll et al 2012 2013 2019 garrido et al 2020a 2020b vela et al 2019 the photocatalytic remediation experiments at field scale were applied to the residual water resulting from the cleaning and rinse of the tanks equipment and machines used for the phytosanitary treatments to the four commercial farms the residual water was accumulated in the tanks of each pilot device throughout 2017 until reaching a sufficient volume to start the corresponding photocatalytic cycle they were carried out between may and november given each farm s nature different volumes of residual water were obtained as well as a great variability on number concentration and type of pesticide content the number of active ingredients in each case was 6 farm 3 15 farm 4 16 farm 1 and 19 farm 2 the volume of treated residual water varied from 1620 l farm 3 to 3600 l farm 2 a total of 300 g of different pesticides were found in the 90hl in the accumulated residual water in the four pilot farms 50 photocatalytic cycles were necessary for the remediation of such that volume of residual water fig 2 a represents the total amount of pesticides found in the residual water of each farm both initially and after ending the photocatalytic cycles the degradation of the monitored pesticides was 83 3 in farm 1 83 6 in farm 2 97 8 in farm 3 and 82 4 in farm 4 the lower percentages correspond with the presence of high concentrations of some pesticides because the leftovers of the phytosanitary mixture prepared for the crop treatments were added to the wastewater mixture to be treated these high concentrations on the order of 10 or more ppm slowed down the process due to the higher load of organic matter active matter plus adjutants of the commercial product fenoll et al 2019 garrido et al 2020a for these cases the efficiency of the process could be improved through episodic dilutions of the residual water and increased photoperiods the dissolved organic carbon doc contents of the treated residual water are shown in fig 2b average doc values sd after the photocatalytic cycles were 22 5 6 4 farm 1 25 1 7 9 farm 2 22 7 4 9 farm 3 y 18 6 6 2 farm 4 with an average mineralisation rate of about 78 mineralisation is not complete in any case possibly because of the generation of metabolites during the photocatalytic process as well as the presence of other organic compounds in the commercial products 3 2 financial assessment the company responsible for the development and building the pilot equipment aquemfree novagric made the calculations of the manufacturing costs of the pilot aquemfree 200 l as well as a budget of another device doubling the one cycle capacity 400 l verifying the economies of scale of the investment and therefore of the derivative fixed costs the aquemfree 400 l case was developed using the performance rates obtained from the practical experience of the pilot case aquemfree 200 l table 2 shows the main figures of the investments corresponding to the aquemfree equipment in both cases 200 and 400 l including the improvements after the experimental process in the pilot farms regarding investment the structure works concrete floor and electric and hydraulic systems are not much relevant and in addition the bigger the device is the lesser importance they have 24 and 18 respectively this circumstance supports the possibility of using the same device in different places given its compact design and little infrastructure in special for bigger sizes table 3 contains the cost accounting of the aquemfree systems 200 l and 400 l with the fixed and current assets in absolute and relative values the weight of the fixed costs reaches about 81 in both cases involving a faster amortisation for a higher frequency of use every increase of the number of cycles per year will directly imply a cost decrease though the maximisation of the use directly depends on the established radiation threshold being 30 cycles per year the limit due to climatic conditions another consequence of the relative high weight of the fixed costs is that any reduction of the investment likewise the increase of the one cycle capacity in litres would make the cost of every cycle significantly lower thus it might be of interest to study the development of a portable aquemfree device with the accumulation tank fixed in the farm and with a volume bigger than the current one in the design of the pilot system this fix tank can be designed as a pool or container made of transparent plastic or glass maximising sunlight exposure as a kind of pre treatment regarding variable costs the cost of the reagents only means a 2 61 of the annual total cost in the same range of electric power aquemfree 200 which is according to giménez et al 2015 who showed an energetic cost between 1 4 and 2 3 for different photocatalytic systems tested in laboratory at pilot plant scale the energy cost of the aquemfree system is relatively low fenoll et al 2019 a 1 85 of the annual total cost table 3 being quite energy efficient the impact of the variable costs on the unit cost is far lesser than its repercussion on the total cost despite of that a significant reduction on the unit cost would be obtained through lowering the electric consumption prior a certain design improvement table 4 shows an overview of the unit variable costs of each photocatalytic cycle for both aquemfree cases to relativise running costs excluding fixed costs it is in this way highlighted the weight of labour costs on total variable costs reaching 51 for aquemfree 200 and decreasing in importance for a larger capacity device 35 for aquemfree 400 while consumable and energy costs are directly proportional to the treated volume finally table 5 shows a comparative view of the analysis results through the economic and performance indicators the values of investment equipment volume verify the economies of scale mainly due the fixed cost that is the investment and the corresponding fixed costs aquemfree 400 reduces this index 32 respect to aquemfree 200 being a significant decrease of the total cost the total annual cost year 1 expresses the cost of the system use and therefore the cost overrun produced by the photocatalytic cycle on the usual farm costs these absolute figures are later related to the crop surface economies of scale can be seen both for fixed and for variable costs but it is much higher for the first ones due to their important weight 81 on the total costs aquemfree 400 reduces the total cost about 31 a tendency confirmed for equipment with a bigger capacity the unit total cost l 1 relates the productivity of the device use with the one cycle capacity resulting in the cost of the cycle per reclaimed litre for both studied cases 200 and 400 l being 0 38 and 0 26 respectively these results are in the range of others obtained at laboratory scale e g for treatments limited to the yearly radiation fenoll et al 2012 estimated 0 209 l 1 and vela et al 2018 0 406 l 1 the differences might arise from the value of the fixed costs as lab scale uses a low cost only 70 of the total compared to the 81 of the aquemfree equipment the potential area liable to be served by an aquemfree device ha year 1 is shown in table 6 the system is very effective in every case in special in those with a lower number of phytosanitary treatments tree crops a problem of efficiency can arise from the characteristic seasonality of each crop but this can be solved though the storage of the wastewater other possibility is the use of the same aquemfree device in one or more farms with different crops such as combining fruit and citrus trees on the other hand it results evident that the larger the farm area is the more efficient the system becomes in economics operational and seasonality terms all this can mean the basis for a shared use of the system e g by farmers of a cooperative or association finally the impact of the system use on the production costs of lemon peach tomato and pepper garcía garcía 2018 2020 are displayed in table 7 for instance in a lemon tree farm with the established potential area 160 ha the cost overrun of using the system aquemfree 200 is 14 21 ha 1 which is an increment of 0 234 of the production cost for those crops with higher production costs a fewer relative impact is produced by the use of aquemfree the lowest cost overruns are found for tomato in greenhouse being 0 067 and 0 047 for devices of 200 l and 400 l respectively these increments are very low in every studied case providing the application to the potential area previously calculated for each crop in this regard the use of the system by a farmer association cooperative or similar with a larger capacity device e g 800 l would significantly reduce the cost of its service and enlarge the potential farm area of application to conclude no economic data is available for alternative treatments found in bibliography however although some technologies such as heliosec osmofilm or phytobac seem to be less expensive than aquemfree all of them generate a final residue that needs to be managed and eliminated what would increase risks and costs despite being little the use of aquemfree would only represent a cost increase for farmers it is an innovative form to implement circular economy in farms given the system not only degrades pesticides but also increases water available for being reuse however it is not mandatory the use of such kind of remediation treatments in such a context to encourage farmers to adopt such kind of technology would only be possible as a result of a the use of environmental marketing to gain in market advantages by a reaction based on consumers awareness and or b governance issues through legislation or financial support e g common agricultural policy european agricultural fund for rural development 4 conclusions residual levels of pesticides may represent an important source of contamination especially after prolonged use their mobility in the atmosphere and water their accumulation and or transformation in the environment and finally their biomagnification really do constitute a risk for human health wildlife and the environment despite of their benefits regarding increased yield and product quality the increasing social concern about environmental and health issues has promoted the development of legal and technical instruments devoted to relieving the consequences of such pollution a pilot equipment was developed and implemented to apply an in farm remediation by solar photocatalysis of agro waste water with pesticides from remnants cleaning and rinse this aquemfree system involves additional costs to farm productions and although the impact is very low for intensive irrigated crops the cost overrun must be minimised economic sustainability is not the main contribution of this remediation system but an innovative form to implement circular economy in farms therefore the reduction of the environmental impact might be used as a tool for environmental marketing consumers awareness and institutional support are key points for the compliance of the current regulations public financial support would facilitate the implementation of the aquemfree technology allowing the proper treatment of this

9932,a pilot equipment aquemfree was developed and tested for the remediation and reuse of agro wastewater with pesticides derived from the remnants cleaning and rinse of phytosanitary equipment and packaging through a photocatalytic process using tio2 na2s2o8 and sunlight the purpose of this work is the assessment of the economic sustainability of the aquemfree system studying four pilot devices on representative farms of mediterranean crops and their impact on the cost structure of each crop two cases per farm were established pilot devices equipped with a 200 l aquemfree 200 or a 400 l aquemfree 400 reaction tank pesticide degradation varied between 82 4 and 97 8 as for financial assessment the large importance of the fixed costs 81 involves a faster amortisation for a higher frequency of use whose maximisation depends on radiation threshold 30 cycles per year financial indicators related to the equipment capacity show cost reductions of 31 for the bigger device verifying the economies of scale the impact of the system use involves a low increase 0 24 0 05 of the crop production costs corresponding fewer values to crops with higher production costs the potential farm area of application of an aquemfree 200 device is very large 160 ha for trees and 53 63 6 ha for greenhouses and doubled by aquemfree 400 in conclusion aquemfree has a high remediation performance and a low financial impact on intensive crop production costs due to its economies of scale it is recommended the use of higher capacity devices either for big farms or to be shared by several farmers establishing a combination of a portable compact device and wastewater storing tanks in the farms keywords pesticides agro wastewater reuse solar photocatalysis pilot plant financial assessment 1 introduction the assessment of the economic sustainability is a paramount requirement to carry out business operations for a new product or process besides the assessment of the environmental sustainability is a strategic instrument to increase its value in relation to the rising environmental awareness during the last decades barber et al 2009 consumers have introduced the environmental concern as an important factor in their purchase processes showing preference for those products showing environmental sensitivity barber et al 2009 and causing the corresponding market reaction to this demand thus the setting up of sustainable production patterns based on socioeconomic and environmental criteria is a fundamental strategy to achieve the objective of a viable and competitive agricultural activity there is a need to establish productive systems for sustainable crops encouraging the quality of the production and working methods with favourable effects on the population and the rural world in the social economic and environmental scopes with a circular economy approach garcía and garcía 2018 voulvoulis 2018 the use of plant protection products also called phytosanitary products or pesticides has been determinant for the increase of food production in the last century from an agronomical perspective it is ideal that those substances persist for a time enough to control pests and diseases however a longer persistence involves a higher risk of environmental pollution along with the environmental problems associated to the use of pesticides persistence and accumulation in soils mobility between environmental compartments production of intermediate compounds the highest concern comes from their presence in food products and the effects on consumer health this social demand has promoted the formulation of legal instruments underpinning the control and regulation of such substances limiting the adverse effects of their use the directive 2009 128 ec of the european parliament and of the council of 21 october 2009 establishing a framework for community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides european commission 2009 obliges members states to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the operations by professional users and where applicable by distributors do not endanger human health or the environment regarding remnants of pesticides tank mixtures remaining after application and cleaning of the equipment used after application the directive only offers vague recommendations for a proper management of these residues although some countries such as france requires from farmers the use of authorised systems ministère du l écologie de déloppemenr durable et de l énergie 2015 however most of these systems offer an incomplete solution because there is a transfer of the problem from water to soil or to a waste plant and an incomplete degradation generating new residues felsot et al 2003 garrido et al 2020a new technologies have been launched in the las decade devoted to the remediation of polluted water by anthropogenic activities allowing its reuse which is of particular importance in regions with high irrigation demand and scarce water resources many recent studies are targeted to develop oxidation procedures of persistent organic compounds in aquatic environments these advanced oxidation processes are based on catalytic and photochemical procedures to cause deep changes in the pollutant structure through the generation of free radicals and reacting with the contaminants by their complete mineralisation maldonado et al 2007 among them the most used technique is the heterogenous photocatalysis using semiconductor solids as photocatalysts capable to absorb direct or indirectly uv light in contact with water a series of oxidation and reduction reactions are produced on the catalyst surface finalising with the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh which are very oxidant and little selective species and can therefore produce the fast degradation of many organic compounds into carbon dioxide water and mineral salts fenoll et al 2013 heterogenous photocatalysis with solar radiation has been applied to wastewater from the cleaning and rinse of phytosanitary equipment for its remediation and reuse to irrigate a lettuce and pepper crops aliste et al 2020 2021 the results show an efficient and simple technology to regenerate and reuse large volume of agro wastewater polluted with pesticides for vegetables irrigation reducing the risk for human health and environment no significant differences were observed when comparing different quality parameters in lettuce and pepper grown using treated and non treated agro wastewater in this context this work was aimed to develop a viable solution for the remediation of the agro wastewater with pesticide residues derived from the remnants cleaning and rinse of phytosanitary equipment and packaging through a photocatalytic process using tio2 na2s2o8 and sunlight for this purpose a pilot device of the aquemfree system was developed built and installed in collaboration between researchers of imida and the engineering team of the company novedades agrícolas s a novagric first the different variables of the photocatalytic process were optimised with artificial light on a laboratory scale then the technique was applied through the equipment installed in four commercial farms chosen by their representativeness of different crops in se spain an optimal area for the study for its significant wide ranging agriculture and water demand resources conditions once the technical viability of the photocatalytic process was verified the implementation of the aquemfree system was subject of a socioeconomic assessment despite some works evaluate treatments applied to wastewater polluted by phytosanitary mixtures with an economic approach fenoll et al 2012 vela et al 2018 and even economic and environmental simultaneously giménez et al 2015 they do it on small tests at laboratory scale the use of a pilot plant scale provides useful information to be scaled up to farm situations as the basis for farmers to make information based decisions on the system viability and its impact on their crop cost effectiveness 2 materials and methods 2 1 pesticides and reagents analytical standards 95 purity and commercial formulations of pesticides were supplied by dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany and fitodolores s l murcia spain respectively tio2 aeroxide p25 99 5 was obtained from nippon aerosil co ltd osaka japan na2s2o8 98 and nacl were provided by panreac química barcelona spain acetonitrile was purchased from scharlab barcelona spain 2 2 photoreaction setup at lab scale the optimisation of the influential parameters in the photocatalysis process was performed at laboratory scale using a photochemical reactor sbs barcelona spain the methodology followed and features of the equipment were previously described by fenoll et al 2013 with the purpose of optimising the type and concentration of catalyst and oxidant several essays were carried out with different reaction systems based on combinations between catalysts with or without oxidant agent 2 3 experimental setup at pilot plant scale the trial was performed in four commercial farms located in murcia se spain using a pilot plant cpc technology each one under natural sunlight irradiation during june and october 2017 fig 1 farm 1 latitude 37 26 26 8 n longitude 1 35 07 0 w elevation 116 m was dedicated to tomato and watermelon crops farm 2 latitude 37 46 25 7 n longitude 0 52 59 5 w elevation 25 m was dedicated to pepper artichoke and lettuce crops farm 3 latitude 38 06 44 4 n longitude 1 01 58 0 w elevation 113 m was dedicated to citrus fruits and farm 4 latitude 38º 16 53 n longitude 1º 27 23 w elevation 248 m was dedicated to stone fruit crops the farms were selected attending to different factors geographical situation management and cultivation intimately related with the residues generated in order to achieve a representative analysis of the problem tackled different photocatalytic treatments hereinafter cycles were carried out in each farm a small prototype aquemfree was used to carry out all photochemical processes under field conditions fig 1 the process is controlled by an automated electronic unit and starts when water coming from remnants and cleaning of the phytosanitary treatment equipment is passed through a sand filter and collected in a storage tank 1000 l a centrifugal pump impulses 0 26 kw the water from this tank to the reaction tank 180 l where the catalyst and oxidant agents are added and then to the photoreactor section 75 l in this section the water is exposed to sunlight irradiation while it circulates through four borosilicate tubes connected in series and come back to the reaction tank the system works in continuous mode making possible the recirculation of water 65 l min 1 during a selected period of time from 9 pm to 7 am it is thermostated 25 1 c by a cooler and continuously stirred to maintain a uniform slurry a photoradiometer was integrated to record values kjm 2 of uva 315 400 nm radiation in order to increase the incident irradiation the tubes were placed on a curved aluminium reflector with four different positions available depending on the season in which the cycle is going to be performed finally an ultra filtration membrane mann hummel u860 cartridge and a filtered water tank was incorporated to recover tio2 after treatments the trial was initiated with the addition of 300 mg l 1 of na2s2o8 and 300 mg l 1 of tio2 to the corresponding reaction tank during the photoperiod several samples were taken at regular intervals the experiments ended up when a value of 7000 kj m 2 of accumulated irradiation was reached 2 4 analytical determinations pesticide residues were isolated from water by liquid liquid extraction and analysed by hplc ms2 following the method published by fenoll et al 2011 analytical conditions for each compound have been reported in previous works aliste et al 2020 fenoll et al 2012 2019 garrido et al 2020a 2020b kushniarou et al 2019 vela et al 2019 a multi n c 3100 toc analyzer analytic jena ag jena germany equipped with an ndir detector 950 c was used to measure dissolved organic carbon doc content after sample filtration 0 45 µm 2 5 financial assessment the economic assessment of the aquemfree system is based on the analysis of its implementation in the current productive system as an alternative wastewater treatment in the farms for this purpose four standard commercial farms were selected representing different types of production lemon tree peach tree tomato under greenhouse and pepper under greenhouse for different scenarios the average costs of the system establishment and management were calculated to estimate their impact on the cost accounting of each crop established by garcía garcía 2018 2020 through economic and performance indicators a cost accounting methodology was used including fixed costs amortisation of equipment and variable costs maintenance and operating costs the economic assessment was based on the conventional cost analysis methods layard and glaister 1994 ballestero 2000 garcía garcía et al 2012 2013 romero azorín and garcía garcía 2020 fernández et al 2020 through several interviews with the engineering team of novagric and with the technical staff of the pilot farms the aquemfree system variables regarding maintenance and operation were established and the corresponding data were compiled as the basis for the financial assessment table 1 each one of the pilot devices installed in the farms was equipped with a 200 l reaction tank aquemfree 200 and another theoretical case device was defined with twice the capacity 400 l for aquemfree 400 in order to study possible economies of scale 2 5 1 investment and fixed costs characteristics an aquemfree device is considered as a complete compact product with a useful life of 12 16 years based on its components valves tanks electronics except for some smaller parts made of pvc or pe or pumps which are subjected to longer running periods in unfavourable conditions thus according to the engineering team of novagric the lifespan of the pumps was determined in 5 years and their replacement was included as part of the balancing item maintenance the useful life of the aquemfree system was established in 15 years and in 30 years for the concrete foundations amortisations were calculated by the linear or constant quotas method romero azorín and garcía garcía 2020 2 5 2 variable costs characteristics the variable costs are related to equipment maintenance catalyst oxidant electric power and operation and control labour based on the experimental results of the photocatalytic process the variables for the two cases aquemfree 200 and 400 were established the dose and price of catalyst and oxidant the average duration of a photocatalytic cycle and therefore a realistic number of cycles per year considering seasonality according to solar radiation operational data were obtained from the records and interviews with the technical staff of the farms wastewater volume to be treated after a plant health treatment operation labour time equipment control and controlled discharge or storage of the treated water and electric energy the catalyst was recovered by an ultrafiltration membrane to be reused three more times thus the catalyst was used in a total of 4 photocatalytic cycles 2 5 3 economic and performance indicators the values of some variables and the relation among them were used to display the economic dimension of the aquemfree system investment equipment volume this indicator shows the relationship between the investment value and the one cycle capacity volume of the device in l 1 to evaluate the economies of scale total annual cost the total cost per year of the aquemfree system for each studied case 200 and 400 l as the sum of fixed costs year 1 and variable costs year 1 unit total cost this indicator relates the total annual cost the sum of fixed and variable costs with the annual treated wastewater volume l 1 cycle unit cost cycle 1 this indicator reports the total annual cost of every treatment cycle it expresses the same concept than the preceding but related to one cycle 200 or 400 l other two indicators potential area ha and impact of the system use on the production cost were calculated regarding the farm characteristics for each crop type pilot farm stone fruit trees lemon trees open air vegetables and greenhouse vegetables for both indicators there is a major repercussion of the number of phytosanitary treatments which is in direct relation to the kind of crop the potential area expresses the crop surface to be potentially treated with the maximum volume of phytosanitary spray whose residues are likely to be treated by an aquemfree device in 1 year its calculation is made with the equation eq 1 1 crop surface ha a b xcx d e where a number of hours of a working day 8 h day 1 b performance of a phytosanitary treatment h treatment ha 1 c number of working days to fill in the aquemfree accumulation tank 4 days cycle 1 for aquemfree 200 d number of remediation cycles by an aquemfree device 30 cycles year 1 e number of phytosanitary treatments treatment year 1 the calculations were made for the model established by garcía garcía 2018 2020 phytosanitary treatments applied with a 90 cv tractor and a 2000 l tank including for every case the preparation idle and transport times and assuming a daily tank rinse the cleaning of 4 or 8 phytosanitary tanks are needed to refill one aquemfree reaction tank of 200 or 400 l capacity respectively table 1 the annual number of aquemfree remediation cycles 30 cycles year 1 was estimated considering their different length along the year according to the daylight the impact of the system use on the production costs for the different crops was calculated as the overrun involved by the aquemfree use on the cost accounting of each crop garcía garcía 2018 2020 both in absolute and in relative values 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation experiments in situ at field scale before starting trials in pilot plants under natural irradiation the optimal concentrations of tio2 and na2s2o8 were determined at laboratory scale following the methodology described by fenoll et al 2019 a value of 300 mg l 1 was selected for both reagents what is in concordance with results obtained in other works fenoll et al 2012 2013 2019 garrido et al 2020a 2020b vela et al 2019 the photocatalytic remediation experiments at field scale were applied to the residual water resulting from the cleaning and rinse of the tanks equipment and machines used for the phytosanitary treatments to the four commercial farms the residual water was accumulated in the tanks of each pilot device throughout 2017 until reaching a sufficient volume to start the corresponding photocatalytic cycle they were carried out between may and november given each farm s nature different volumes of residual water were obtained as well as a great variability on number concentration and type of pesticide content the number of active ingredients in each case was 6 farm 3 15 farm 4 16 farm 1 and 19 farm 2 the volume of treated residual water varied from 1620 l farm 3 to 3600 l farm 2 a total of 300 g of different pesticides were found in the 90hl in the accumulated residual water in the four pilot farms 50 photocatalytic cycles were necessary for the remediation of such that volume of residual water fig 2 a represents the total amount of pesticides found in the residual water of each farm both initially and after ending the photocatalytic cycles the degradation of the monitored pesticides was 83 3 in farm 1 83 6 in farm 2 97 8 in farm 3 and 82 4 in farm 4 the lower percentages correspond with the presence of high concentrations of some pesticides because the leftovers of the phytosanitary mixture prepared for the crop treatments were added to the wastewater mixture to be treated these high concentrations on the order of 10 or more ppm slowed down the process due to the higher load of organic matter active matter plus adjutants of the commercial product fenoll et al 2019 garrido et al 2020a for these cases the efficiency of the process could be improved through episodic dilutions of the residual water and increased photoperiods the dissolved organic carbon doc contents of the treated residual water are shown in fig 2b average doc values sd after the photocatalytic cycles were 22 5 6 4 farm 1 25 1 7 9 farm 2 22 7 4 9 farm 3 y 18 6 6 2 farm 4 with an average mineralisation rate of about 78 mineralisation is not complete in any case possibly because of the generation of metabolites during the photocatalytic process as well as the presence of other organic compounds in the commercial products 3 2 financial assessment the company responsible for the development and building the pilot equipment aquemfree novagric made the calculations of the manufacturing costs of the pilot aquemfree 200 l as well as a budget of another device doubling the one cycle capacity 400 l verifying the economies of scale of the investment and therefore of the derivative fixed costs the aquemfree 400 l case was developed using the performance rates obtained from the practical experience of the pilot case aquemfree 200 l table 2 shows the main figures of the investments corresponding to the aquemfree equipment in both cases 200 and 400 l including the improvements after the experimental process in the pilot farms regarding investment the structure works concrete floor and electric and hydraulic systems are not much relevant and in addition the bigger the device is the lesser importance they have 24 and 18 respectively this circumstance supports the possibility of using the same device in different places given its compact design and little infrastructure in special for bigger sizes table 3 contains the cost accounting of the aquemfree systems 200 l and 400 l with the fixed and current assets in absolute and relative values the weight of the fixed costs reaches about 81 in both cases involving a faster amortisation for a higher frequency of use every increase of the number of cycles per year will directly imply a cost decrease though the maximisation of the use directly depends on the established radiation threshold being 30 cycles per year the limit due to climatic conditions another consequence of the relative high weight of the fixed costs is that any reduction of the investment likewise the increase of the one cycle capacity in litres would make the cost of every cycle significantly lower thus it might be of interest to study the development of a portable aquemfree device with the accumulation tank fixed in the farm and with a volume bigger than the current one in the design of the pilot system this fix tank can be designed as a pool or container made of transparent plastic or glass maximising sunlight exposure as a kind of pre treatment regarding variable costs the cost of the reagents only means a 2 61 of the annual total cost in the same range of electric power aquemfree 200 which is according to giménez et al 2015 who showed an energetic cost between 1 4 and 2 3 for different photocatalytic systems tested in laboratory at pilot plant scale the energy cost of the aquemfree system is relatively low fenoll et al 2019 a 1 85 of the annual total cost table 3 being quite energy efficient the impact of the variable costs on the unit cost is far lesser than its repercussion on the total cost despite of that a significant reduction on the unit cost would be obtained through lowering the electric consumption prior a certain design improvement table 4 shows an overview of the unit variable costs of each photocatalytic cycle for both aquemfree cases to relativise running costs excluding fixed costs it is in this way highlighted the weight of labour costs on total variable costs reaching 51 for aquemfree 200 and decreasing in importance for a larger capacity device 35 for aquemfree 400 while consumable and energy costs are directly proportional to the treated volume finally table 5 shows a comparative view of the analysis results through the economic and performance indicators the values of investment equipment volume verify the economies of scale mainly due the fixed cost that is the investment and the corresponding fixed costs aquemfree 400 reduces this index 32 respect to aquemfree 200 being a significant decrease of the total cost the total annual cost year 1 expresses the cost of the system use and therefore the cost overrun produced by the photocatalytic cycle on the usual farm costs these absolute figures are later related to the crop surface economies of scale can be seen both for fixed and for variable costs but it is much higher for the first ones due to their important weight 81 on the total costs aquemfree 400 reduces the total cost about 31 a tendency confirmed for equipment with a bigger capacity the unit total cost l 1 relates the productivity of the device use with the one cycle capacity resulting in the cost of the cycle per reclaimed litre for both studied cases 200 and 400 l being 0 38 and 0 26 respectively these results are in the range of others obtained at laboratory scale e g for treatments limited to the yearly radiation fenoll et al 2012 estimated 0 209 l 1 and vela et al 2018 0 406 l 1 the differences might arise from the value of the fixed costs as lab scale uses a low cost only 70 of the total compared to the 81 of the aquemfree equipment the potential area liable to be served by an aquemfree device ha year 1 is shown in table 6 the system is very effective in every case in special in those with a lower number of phytosanitary treatments tree crops a problem of efficiency can arise from the characteristic seasonality of each crop but this can be solved though the storage of the wastewater other possibility is the use of the same aquemfree device in one or more farms with different crops such as combining fruit and citrus trees on the other hand it results evident that the larger the farm area is the more efficient the system becomes in economics operational and seasonality terms all this can mean the basis for a shared use of the system e g by farmers of a cooperative or association finally the impact of the system use on the production costs of lemon peach tomato and pepper garcía garcía 2018 2020 are displayed in table 7 for instance in a lemon tree farm with the established potential area 160 ha the cost overrun of using the system aquemfree 200 is 14 21 ha 1 which is an increment of 0 234 of the production cost for those crops with higher production costs a fewer relative impact is produced by the use of aquemfree the lowest cost overruns are found for tomato in greenhouse being 0 067 and 0 047 for devices of 200 l and 400 l respectively these increments are very low in every studied case providing the application to the potential area previously calculated for each crop in this regard the use of the system by a farmer association cooperative or similar with a larger capacity device e g 800 l would significantly reduce the cost of its service and enlarge the potential farm area of application to conclude no economic data is available for

9933,water is a common resource shared by many agents or farmers in irrigation districts where water management is therefore a very complex problem if the target is the equitable distribution of resources or the efficient use of water this paper aims to present the design and implementation of an irrigation agent based model iabm for the distribution of water in an irrigation district in the iabm proposed each field or farm can be considered as a micro level and a region or irrigation district as a macro level the most approximated irrigation scheduling at each micro level allows determining the water needs at the macro level as a reference for the negotiation of water distribution a geographical information system gis was used to manage georeferenced field information field capacity and permanent wilting point values initial soil moisture crop types crop coefficients root depth sowing dates and weather data were incorporated into the iabm model for determining irrigation prescriptions when water available in the irrigation district is insufficient to supply water requirements of all the irrigation fields the iabm allows water distribution among them according to the cultivated field sizes irrigation priorities phenological states and the behavior of neighbors when water resources are distributable the proposed negotiation algorithm ensures that fields will use irrigation prescriptions defined with technical and agronomic criteria thus avoiding the waste of water resource the iabm developed meets the satisfaction requirement of the greatest number of agents by avoiding as much as possible that the soil water stress increases using 25 of permissible level of moisture depletion respect to the total available water in each field keywords agent based model irrigation scheduling negotiation precision irrigation water sustainability 1 introduction efficient water management in agricultural crops is of paramount importance for sustainable development and food security mango et al 2018 currently climate change and water scarcity in some parts of the world urge the search for solutions that allow the optimization of agricultural processes thus obtaining higher yields with better use of resources and reduction of production costs ojha et al 2015 precision irrigation consists of sustainable water management which involves applying water to crops to meet specific plant needs adeyemi et al 2018 with the development of modern technologies a considerable transformation has been observed in many areas especially in precision agriculture applications artificial intelligence ai has acquired a major role in daily lives thus improving our perceptions and abilities to modify the environment around us talaviya et al 2020 in ai the systems called agents use reactive or rational behavior to determine actions in the surrounding environment jimenez et al 2020b an agent is an autonomous entity which obtains information from the environment using a perception system makes decisions through strategies and carries out actions to modify the environment using actuators russell and norvig 2016 irrigation districts are complex systems farmers can be considered as adaptive agents who have autonomy intelligence and relative knowledge about their environment crop fields an et al 2005 these agents can update their knowledge and adjust their behaviors to the environment change farmers are interconnected through social relationships with irrigation management authorities and also with their neighbors the interactions between farmers could lead to patterns at the aggregate level as conflict resolution through negotiation coordination cooperation and competition in the distribution of water resources cai and xiong 2017 multi agent systems mas

and simulation of large scale irrigation models primarily by flood irrigation guyennon et al 2016 competition for the use of water is increasing globally and the development of models that allow simulating views of the competing parties are necessary to negotiate water resources and mitigate conflicts abm models have also been used as a conflict resolution strategy for the management of irrigation resources between stakeholders akhbari and grigg 2013 explain the development of an abm that takes into account the interactions among the parties and how they can be encouraged to cooperate in the game to work toward a solution cai and xiong 2017 implemented an abm simulation for studying cooperation formation when irrigation is used the stakeholder first becomes a potential participant when the cost of cooperation it needs to cover is not higher than the amount it can afford or is willing to pay on top of this the propensity that the stakeholder participates is heavily affected by its personal characteristics and neighborhood effects finally belaqziz et al 2014 implemented an abm simulation focused on gravity irrigation systems with an evolutionary strategy algorithm for the distribution in rate and time of water resources in a pilot region located in morocco several researches have applied multi agent models to study water distribution in cultivated regions with several stakeholders but none have used neither crop phenological characteristics as a relevant negotiation parameter nor agent satisfaction levels as irrigation performance measurement in the design of intelligent agents additionally the use of crop characteristics and neighbor behaviors for negotiation and water distribution introduces proactive and social behaviors in the irrigation agents of the abm proposed in this paper which can be implemented with real devices in crop fields jimenez et al 2020b for more details about multi agent systems and their applications to irrigation management please refer to the previous work by jimenez et al 2020a this paper shows the design and implementation of an irrigation agent based model iabm for the large scale irrigation and drainage district of chicamocha and firavitoba usochicamocha in boyacá colombia where water is a common resource shared by many agents this district is currently comprised of eleven irrigation units that benefit about 4000 ha of 6087 potentials irrigation waters are taken from the chicamocha riverbed and carried to the fields through pumping stations since the implementation of the district in 1998 the bulb onion cultivation has emerged as an alternative of commercial agriculture under irrigation looking for the agricultural reconversion of lands considered for use in livestock the establishment of productive systems with the use of irrigation has caused difficulties and shortcomings mainly due to the lack of knowledge of the biophysical and technological components associated with the use of water in the exploitation of horticultural crops especially the bulb onion whose planting area in the district has reached more than 2000 ha per year 1000 per semester cycle the specific problem of the usochicamocha irrigation district is the physical and hydraulic infrastructure which is considered adequate for the distribution of land irrigation but becomes inefficient due to the non application of technical criteria with concepts that indicate when how much and how to irrigate cely 2010 a characteristic of the proposed iabm is the management of local information in the cultivated fields farmers are simulated as intelligent agents with the capability of determining water requirements based on the soil water balance equation and field data as soil textures and soil hydrologic parameters additionally the iabm system is implemented with social capabilities represented by cooperative and non cooperative behaviors among neighbors agents and the ability to negotiate the distribution of resources when there is not enough water to maintain all the cultivated plots at field capacity after the negotiation procedure the agents apply irrigation to their crops according to new prescriptions that seek to optimize the distribution of irrigation in the study region where the system was implemented the contribution of this work is an agent based modelling framework specifically designed for the management of water resources in an irrigation district including the representation of collective decision making procedures with the integration of real geographical and weather data python algorithms and netlogo this framework allows the negotiation of water resources in an irrigation district taking into account the emerging behavior from the micro farmers to macro irrigation district levels for the efficient management of freshwater in agriculture as one of the most important resources for the humanity subsistence 2 materials and methods this research was developed in the large scale irrigation and drainage district of chicamocha and firavitoba usochicamocha located in boyacá colombia the division of the territory belonging to the usochicamocha irrigation district was defined by the territorial arrangement planning tap of the department of boyacá colombia this governmental body divided the district into eleven territorial sectors adjacent to the riverbed of the chicamocha river to guide and manage the physical development of the territory and the use of the land these territorial sectors defined in the tap coincide with the established fields in the irrigation units without considering the spatial heterogeneities of the soils however climatic conditions of these irrigation units are homogeneous given their spatial proximity temperature relative humidity rainfall and altitude level therefore the district has eleven irrigation units with one pumping station each holanda surba pantano de vargas ayalas duitama cuche san rafael las vueltas tibasosa ministerio and monquirá fig 1 the water sources are la copa and la playa dams and water is distributed throughout the chicamocha riverbed each pumping station is responsible for supplying water to several fields the experimental fields used in this study corresponded to the san rafael irrigation unit that has an area of 8451 3 k m 2 and is located in 5 789569 n 72 988214 w fig 1 shows the cultivated fields supplied by the san rafael pumping station located in the municipality of nobsa boyacá colombia the area comprised by the san rafael irrigation unit has an annual average of solar brightness of 1852 hours and an average temperature of 14 05 c with a high qualification for the sowing of agricultural species weather spark 2020 there is a humidity deficit of 485 mm year derived from an annual average of rainfall and evaporation rates of 798 mm year and 1283 mm year respectively the environmental climate corresponds to dry cold with a bimodal regime and a water deficit in most of the months with a concentration of rains between of april and may in the first semester and october to november in the second according to 10 year data cely 2010 2 1 crop characterization bulb onion the bulb onion crop allium cepa hybrid yellow granex is the principal product planted in usochicamocha for this study parameters and characteristics of this crop were defined using the results of the project entitled determination of irrigation and drainage parameters for the cultivation of bulb onion allium cepa in soils of the alto chicamocha irrigation district boyacá colombia cod 1c10937819630 supported by the administrative department of science technology and innovation of colombia colciencias and finished in 2009 according to this research three phenological phases were defined for the development of this crop phase i leaves development it is characterized by a minimal accumulation of phytomass and no very noticeable changes in the phenotype this phase begins from transplantation to the beginning of bulbification plants develop 58 of the total leaves acquire 48 of its maximum height and 45 of the maximum number of cataphiles and 63 of the maximum length of the root are formed these values are significant for a single phase which corresponds to 40 of the total cultivation cycle in this phenological state the plant presents a gradual and constant increase in its growth and number of cells of meristematic tissues besides several small and thin leaves appear as well as very fine roots and cataphiles phase ii bulbification this stage is characterized by an increase in most of the physiological parameters in which a representative growth is observed at the beginning of this phase the thickening of the base of the leaves begins the number of cataphiles increases and leaves continue to appear the leaf area increases because its length increases in width and length and a thickening process occurs in the limb and therefore in the pseudostem in the fullness of the phase the equatorial diameter of the onion bulbs increases to exceed 65 of its final diameter the fresh and dry bulb phytomass show a drastic change and the leaves remain erect in the fullness and end of the phase the total dry phytomass increases because all the organs are presenting significant changes in length thickness and stored products of photosynthesis phase iii ripening in this last phase which goes until the harvest or maturity of the crop the highest rate of accumulation of dry and fresh phytomass of the bulb stands out the bulb completes its filling and the rate of appearance of cataphiles decreases as they are thickening to consolidate the final formation of the bulb the leaf part loses importance since the foliar area and the number of leaves remain constant and low at the end of this phase the leaves die after the plants are overwhelmed which basically consists in drying the bulb neck and as a result the plant falls due to the weight of its leaves it is observed that the water consumption of the crop is higher in the second stage of development in addition to a shorter duration in days this corresponds to the phase where the greatest accumulations of biomass occur and the organs develop that is the critical period of the onion bulb cultivation matches the formation of the bulb a stage in which it consumes 47 of its water needs the water requirements in a crop are directly related to the evapotranspiration et corresponding to the water that the plant uses to carry out its physiological functions including that which the plant expels through the leaves transpiration that which is lost from the soil where the crop is evaporation and the water intercepted by the foliage allen et al 1998 e t r is the calculated reference et for grass mm once e t r has been calculated a crop coefficient value k c must be multiplied by e t r for adjusting the value to the studied crop in its different development stages subedi and chávez 2015 the crop water requirements are expressed in millimeters either per day month or vegetative cycle the definition of the phenological scale and k c for the study area are fundamental parameters to carry out the irrigation programming that is required to be applied at each stage of the crop the crop coefficient describes the variations in the amount of water that plants extract from the soil as they develop from sowing to harvest as it depends on the anatomical morphological and physiological plant characteristics spiliotopoulos and loukas 2019 due to the characteristics of the bulb onion crop and the variations in the incidence of e t r during the different growth stages k c changes from planting to harvest according to cely 2010 onion plants have abundant thin roots measuring around 40 mm at the transplanting time from the third week after transplanting the length of the roots begins to increase and consequently their weight subsequently a significant increase in the number of roots is evident becoming abundant without interrupting its growth in length from week 8 onwards a thickening of the roots occurs around week 15 at the beginning of the maturation phase the roots stop growing reaching approximately 165 mm in length and maintain a constant dry weight until the end of the cultivation cycle table 1 shows site specific values of k c effective root depth r d and e t c for the fields located in the san rafael irrigation unit of usochicamocha and defined for bulb onion allium cepa hybrid yellow granex 2 2 field data collection table 2 describes the data sources used in this study daily meteorological data of precipitation pressure maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed radiation evapotranspiration and relative humidity were collected from a davis growweather station with weather wizard iii console davis instruments hayward ca usa located in a field of the san rafael irrigation unit 5 787021 n 72 973932 from november 1 2019 to august 01 2020 precipitation and reference evapotranspiration e t r data were used as input parameters for the hydric balance equation rain was measured and e t r was computed on hourly time step throughout the 24 h period and summed up to a daily time step the effective precipitation was calculated through the methodology stated by adnan and khan 2009 where a k p coefficient is obtained from the relationship between evapotranspiration and the observed precipitation by using eq 1 then the k p coefficient is multiplied by the observed precipitation and the result is equal to the effective precipitation as expressed in eq 2 1 k p 1 011 e 0 001143 e t r ra in 1 011 e 0 5208 e t r rain 2 rai n eff rain k p where k p dimensionless is the precipitation coefficient e t r mm is the reference evapotranspiration rain mm is the precipitation and rai n eff mm is the effective precipitation taking as reference the semi detailed soil study at scale 1 25000 of usochicamocha cely 2010 a total of 100 sites were geo referenced and used for defining textural physical and hydraulic parameters maps the geographical distribution of these sites represents the contrast of the soil pattern and climatic distribution of the area occupied by bulb onion in the usochicamocha district in this study soil maps were prepared with spatial indicators including textures apparent density total porosity and its distribution saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture points saturation fc and pwp these maps were obtained by ordinary kriging interpolation in quantum gis osgeo beaverton or usa and saga dept of physical geography university of hamburg ger the procedure consisted of a structural analysis that evaluated data correlation and dependency through a variogram and a predictive analysis using ordinary kriging arétouyap et al 2015 currently kriging is the best interpolation technique because it is unbiased nevertheless it requires data to be correlated and dependent this structural analysis is conducted by means of the variogram a variogram is a tool that is used to describe the spatial continuity of a phenomenon caridad and jury 2013 the variogram provides a measure of spatial correlation by describing how the sample data are related to distance and direction kaluzny et al 1998 in order to apply the kriging procedure the variogram should be fitted to a simplified model parameters that describe the variogram with sufficient detail are nugget sill and range the spherical model is the most common model in geostatistics and it was selected and implemented using eq 3 3 γ h 0 h 0 c 0 c 1 5 h a 0 5 h a 3 0 h a c 0 c h a where γ h is the variogram h is the offset c 0 is the nugget variance c 0 c is the sill scale c is the partial sill variance and a is the effective range arétouyap et al 2015 semivariograms were used for understanding the spatial dependence for each spatial indicator for each indicator nugget sill and range were defined for the spherical model and the results of the kriging ordinary interpolation were evaluated using the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse according to table 3 fig 2 shows the interpolated maps for field capacity and permanent wilting point for the management of spatial data a polygon layer was developed with all the fields belonging to the san rafael irrigation unit fig 2 zone statistics tool in qgis was used to extract the values of the interpolation maps raster data to the polygon layer these values correspond to the average amount of pixels of the interpolation maps that belong to each field polygon of each spatial indicator finally the geospatial information was organized in a vector file in shape format shp and a dbf file with fields of latitude and longitude of polygon centroid field area sand loam and clay percentages apparent density saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture points saturation fc and pwp this vector layer corresponds to the spatial parameters that are constant in the study region and represent the invariant aspects of the environment in the proposed agent based model 2 3 irrigation prescription a precision irrigation prescription implies watering in such a way that it represents the necessary humidity to obtain optimum yields the total available water taw is the quantity of water that can be stored in the soil and used by crops barradas et al 2012 taw is defined by using the field capacity fc and the permanent wilting point pwp parameters eq 4 4 taw vw c fc vw c pwp 100 r d where vw c fc is the volumetric water content at fc vw c pwp is the volumetric water content at pwp and r d is the effective root depth in mm the fc is related to the quantity of water that a soil can retain after saturation caused by rain or irrigation activities with free drainage and without losses by evaporation until the soil moisture stabilizes the pwp is the point under which a plant cannot extract water from the soil and cannot recover from the loss of water even if water is applied again ghorbani et al 2017 in the iabm irrigation scheduling must be evaluated for each field belonging to the san rafael irrigation unit of usochicamocha the management of irrigation prescriptions in the iabm is used to keep each field within a soil moisture range defined by the percentage of permissible level of moisture depletion mad if the soil is sufficiently wet it supplies water fast enough to meet the atmospheric demand of the crop and keep water uptake equal to etc the knowledge of the initial soil water content in the effective root zone e t c taw rain and irrigation amount on the specific day are necessary for applying the soil water balance equation irrigation is required when e t c exceeds the water supply the net irrigation d is the difference between fc and the current soil volumetric water content in the field deep percolation p mm and runoff ro mm are difficult to estimate assuming that irr and rai n eff readily infiltrate into the soil and discarding ro and p the net irrigation is calculated using eq 5 5 d d 1 irr rai n eff e t c if d is negative then set it to 0 0 where d m m is the soil water deficit or net irrigation requirement d 1 mm is the soil water deficit on the previous day irr mm is the irrigation amount for the current day rai n eff mm is the effective precipitation for the current day and e t c mm is the crop evapotranspiration or crop water requirement for the current day the unit mm means cubic meters of water per square meter of soil the term d is set equal to zero if its value becomes negative when precipitation and or irrigation exceed d 1 plus e t c this means that water added to the soil exceeds field capacity within the plant root zone any water excess in the root zone is assumed to be lost through ro or p andales et al 2011 the irrigation method efficiency ef 60 for surface irrigation 75 for sprinkler irrigation and 90 for drip irrigation is added in the calculus in eq 6 6 d t d 100 ef where d t is the total irrigation mm d is the net irrigation mm and ef is the field application efficiency finally the irrigation time is determined using eq 7 7 irrigation time it d t irrigation application rate the mad is used as a threshold value for defining the irrigation timing associated to the soil water depletion from the fc to the current vwc to enable a crop to extract water from the root zone without suffering water stress only the readily available water raw of the total available water taw is allowed to be depleted as shown in eq 8 al kaisi et al 2009 8 raw taw mad 100 the raw is used as a guide for deciding when to irrigate whenever d raw this condition avoids water stress in the crop and does not depend on the capabilities of the irrigation system 2 4 agent modeling language and framework the multi agent programmable modeling environment netlogo was used for the iabm development jaxa rozen et al 2019 netlogo allows the implementation of the fipa specifications foundation for intelligent physical agent the framework uses two extra libraries one for belief desires and intentions agent architecture bdi and one for agent communication language acl that allows the development of goal oriented agents that communicate using fipa acl messages sakellariou et al 2008 netlogo was selected because it allows the use of geographical information layers and connectivity with hardware devices and algorithms developed in python3 wilensky and rand 2015 turtles patches links and the observer are different types of agents or entities in netlogo these agents are able to carry out their own activities and follow instructions at the same time turtles are the beings that move around the world the grid of patches the world is two dimensional and it is divided into a grid of patches each patch is a squared region of terrain on which the turtles can move the patches have coordinates and cannot move but they may have similar properties to those of turtles the links are the agents that connect two turtles finally the observer has no place in the terrain as it is looking at the world of turtles and patches and controls the experiment each patch and turtle can have their own user defined variables thus allowing the simulation of complex environments according to the abm methodology proposed by wilensky and rand 2015 the first phase is the multi agent framework design which takes into account the spatial distribution interactions and relationships that can exist between the agents the iabm proposed consists of the integration of the supervising planning subsystem and the customer subsystem the supervising planning subsystem sps is responsible for monitoring the irrigation agent status definition of prescription maps using field data mapping using global information and coordination of conflict resolution between agents in the sps the pump station agent psa the weather station agent wsa and the water supply agent wsua interact the customer subsystem is constituted by field agents fa j in charge of the irrigation prescription and the application of water resources where j is the number of the field corresponding to the fa these types of agents accomplish together a fully functional abm with capabilities of autonomy coordination deliberation conflict resolution and decision making the agent modeling language aml is used for specifying the agent roles behavioral aspects and interactions between agents cervenka et al 2005 entities in aml correspond to agents resources environments or organizations designated to explicitly represent various mas society abstractions an organization is a specialized environment type in the iabm the iabm organization is specified in the model of the class level organization structure fig 3 for the external perspective the organization represents an autonomous entity the organization behavior consists on the one hand in the emergent properties and behavior of their agents their mutual relationships observations and interactions and on the other hand in the features and behavior of the entity as a whole for the internal perspective organization units are types of environments specified by structures interactions roles constraints rules among other elements cervenka et al 2005 additionally agents act not only in isolation but also in cooperation or coordination with other agents the resources in the iabm are the water and the information stored in the databases fig 3 shows a class diagram depicting the generic organization structure of the san rafael pump station in the usochicamocha irrigation district the organization comprises a psa agent of the pumpstation entity role type a wsua agent of the watersupply entity role type a wsa agent of the weatherstation entity role type and n fa agents of the field entity role type the fa agents are peers to each other the cooperate connector and subordinates to the psa agent the manage connector the psa agent is superordinate to the wsua agent the manage connector each fa agent of the san rafael pump station organization comprises a sds agent of the smartdecisionsystem entity role type a ps agent of the perceptionsystem entity role type and an iae agent of the irrigationactivationemulation entity role type the number of fa agents n depends on the number of simulated fields 2 4 1 sequence diagram the sequence diagram is used for modeling the interactions between agents with this representation it is possible to illustrate how the different agents of the iabm system interact with each other to carry out the irrigation management and the order in which these interactions are performed for the san rafael irrigation pump station crop fields were defined according to the usochicamocha cartographic map a lifeline represents an individual participant in the sequence diagram and it is shown using a rectangle for its head followed by a vertical dashed line that represents the lifetime of the participant participants in the proposed iabm are the psa wsua wsa fa 1 fa n fig 4 synchronous messages between lifelines were defined the sender waits for the receiver to process the message and returns an answer before carrying on with another message synchronous messages between lifelines were defined the sender waits for the receiver to process the message and returns before carrying on with another message in each irrigation event the pump station agent requests from the wsua the total supply available water tsaw each fa requests rain and reference evapotranspiration data to the wsa all the fas plan irrigation and determine the amount of water they required from wsua at this stage the fas do not actually perform irrigation and only send these values to the psa the psa verifies that the tsaw is sufficient for the water demand the psa verifies that the tsaw is sufficient for the water demand if this is not the case the psa performs the conflict resolution protocol and finally sends the final irrigation scheduling to the fas who carry out the irrigation application the model was adjusted according to crop water requirements soil parameters and the characteristics of the san rafael irrigation unit of usochicamocha the abm implemented in netlogo acquires information about the environment using the vector dataset stored in a shp file afterwards each fa determines its irrigation prescription using its local information such as soil characteristics crops and sowing date and climatic parameters such as rainfall and reference evapotranspiration the total water required twr amount is defined as the sum of all the individual agent water requirements awr it is calculated with the irrigation prescriptions for each field in the region covered by the san rafael irrigation unit using eq 9 9 twr j 1 n aw r j where j represents each field monitored by an agent and aw r j is the water requirement defined by the agent in charge of the field j the total supply available water tsaw for the fields belonging to the san rafael irrigation unit is the total available water that can be used in an irrigation event the tsaw is set by the wsua agent the available water per field area a w j is defined using each field area f a j and eq 10 10 a w j tsaw j n f a j f a j the supply and demand relationships are determined by subtracting the twr from the tsaw eq 11 11 odr tsaw twr on the one hand if odr 0 there is a conflict resolution protocol based on the negotiation of water resources between agents which represents cooperation between them on the other hand if odr 0 there is no need for negotiation between agents which means that there are no cooperation events and field agents receive authorization for applying their initial prescriptions initially in the negotiation process if an agent j has a w j aw r j it is cooperative c otherwise the agent is non cooperative nc the water distribution protocol begins with the assignation of a w j equal to aw r j for cooperative agents for each cooperative agent j there is a saved water amount s w j c defined using eq 12 12 s w j c a w j c aw r j c and aw r j c a w j c 13 t s w s w j c the total saved water amount tsw is defined by the sum of all the s w j c according to eq 13 the new total available water for non cooperative agents ntaw nc is obtained by adding tsw to the total available water of the non cooperative agents using eq 14 and it is distributed between the non cooperative agents according to each irrigation area using eq 15 14 ntaw nc a w j nc tsw 15 a w j nc ntaw nc f a j nc f a j nc at the end of this procedure there is a new cooperative c and non cooperative nc assignation to all the field agents if an agent j has a w j aw r j it is cooperative c otherwise the agent is non cooperative nc eqs 12 15 are repeated until the quantity of tsw 0 or the number of non cooperative agents is equal to zero the last case occurs if the resources are enough to satisfy the needs of all the fields in this case there is no negotiation all the agents can use the irrigation prescription defined and agents are cooperative those assignments are used for defining the proportion of neighbors of agent j with cooperative c and non cooperative nc behaviors utility functions were defined using eqs 16 19 according to the model developed by edwards et al 2005 which is inspired in the sociologic diffusion model for water domains the decision of an agent to change its cooperative or non cooperative behavior in the negotiation process relies on a trade off between social pressure and personal interest social pressure is related to the behavior of neighboring agents while the personal interest is related to the goal of the agent to apply the necessary water according to the phenological state of the plants in order to ensure the best production in its field 16 ψ j c c a p j c i 17 ψ j c nc 1 a 1 p j c 18 ψ j nc c c p j c i 19 ψ j nc nc 1 c 1 p j c where ψ j c c is the utility function defined for maintaining the cooperation status of the agent j ψ j c nc is the utility function defined when an agent j changes from cooperation status to non cooperation status ψ j nc c is the utility function defined when an agent j changes from non cooperation status to cooperation status and ψ j nc nc is the utility function defined for maintaining the non cooperation status of agent j p j c is the proportion of neighbors of agent j of cooperative behavior c the proportion of neighbors for each behavior was calculated using netlogo by defining the number of neighbors in a radius r from the centroid of each polygon feature of the shapefile that corresponds to the location of each agent when agents remain in their current behavior c c or nc nc a 1 c 0 7 on the contrary when agents change to the opposite behavior c nc or nc c 1 a c 0 3 according to akhbari and grigg 2013 i is an operator related to the environment and the field agents and serves as a modification factor that is a function of water requirements according to the phenological status of crops the maximum value of the utility function is 1 and the maximum value of i is 0 3 this value was obtained by solving eq 16 when all the neighbors are collaborative p j c 1 and the maximum value of ψ j c c 1 0 7 1 i as it is the highest utility value that can be obtained using eqs 16 19 the proposed modification factor function decreases linearly from the beginning of the crop development phase 0 3 to the beginning of the mid season or bulbification phase for bulb onion 0 0 once the bulbification phase is finished the utility function increases linearly until the end of the late season or ripening phase for bulb onion 0 3 according to this function the priority irrigation is performed in the bulbification phase as it is the critical period in bulb onion cultivation hence there will be no pressure on the agent to cooperate and the agent might only be influenced by its neighbors the linear behavior is established in the transitions between the phases of leaves development to bulbification and bulbification to ripening as it is the simplest function to represent the changes which is inversely proportional to the behavior of the crop coefficient during the plant development of a crop according to fao 2020 fig 5 the utility function ψ j corresponds to the one with the highest value taking into account whether the agent was initially cooperative eqs 16 and 17 or non cooperative eqs 18 and 19 a study on onion irrigation in southwest texas found that reducing the amount of applied water to 75 of the recommended level resulted in a moderate reduction in marketable yield in addition this condition showed a substantial reduction in the number of larger bulbs sizes leskovar et al 2012 the recommended agricultural management to produce better shape index of onion bulbs is to irrigate onion plants using irrigation level between 80 and 100 of water requirements mubarak and hamdan 2018 if the agent is cooperative in the proposed method ra w j c 2 is the maximum water amount that it is willing to compromise in the negotiation process that corresponds to maintain the soil at 87 5 of water requirements by applying the i factor and calculating the fas utilities ψ j the demand modification amount for the cooperative agent i j c is defined using eq 20 20 i j c ra w j c 2 1 ψ j then the new demand of agent j naw r j c is calculated using eq 21 21 n a w r j c 0 j a w r j c 0 r a w j c 2 i j c j a w r j c 0 the total offer modification amount for the cooperative agents ti is defined by the sum of all the i j c according to eq 22 22 ti i j c the new total available water for the non cooperative agents ntaw nc is obtained by adding ti to the total available water of the non cooperative agents using eq 23 and it is distributed between the non cooperative agents according to each irrigation area using eq 24 23 ntaw nc a w j nc ti 24 a w j nc ntaw nc f a j nc f a j nc at this stage the negotiation process is developed only with the non cooperative agents aw r j nc a w j nc is the maximum water demand for the non cooperative agent j by applying the i factor for non cooperative agents and calculating the fas utilities ψ j the demand modification amount i j nc is defined using eq 25 25 i j n c a w r j n c a w j n c 1 ψ j j a w r j n c a w j n c 0 j a w r j n c a w j n c then the new demand of agent j naw r j nc is calculated using eq 26 26 n a w r j n c 0 j a w r j n c 0 a w j n c i j n c j a w r j n c 0 the non cooperative total new demand tnd nc is calculated by adding all the naw r j nc according to eq 27 27 tnd nc naw r j nc while ntaw nc tnd nc there is an iterative process of water reduction w a j m 3 according to a water amount ρ mm and the field area m 2 by field agent until tsaw tnd for all the cooperative and non cooperative agents using eqs 28 and 29 28 w a j nc f a j nc ρ 29 naw r j nc naw r j nc w a j nc while ntaw tnd there is an iterative process of water distribution of ntaw tnd between all the cooperative and non cooperative agents according to each irrigation area where if naw r j aw r j then naw r j aw r j according to this algorithm the non cooperative field agents demand more water however this new demand could be less than the initially requested and will depend on the behavior of the neighbors and how they cooperate or not in the distribution of the resource at the end of the negotiation stage the total supply available water tsaw amount has to be more than or equal to the total new demand tnd in addition after the negotiation if naw r j a w j then naw r j a w j finally the irrigation agents can define irrigation events but they cannot apply water to their fields without the coordinator agent permission 3 results and discussion the iabm field agents obtain data from their fields define irrigation prescriptions and in the supervising planning subsystem sps the conflict resolution protocol is developed for the distribution of water resources according to the total available water fig 6a and 6b show the behavior of the utility function for the field agents according to changes in the modification factor with respect to the percentage of cooperative neighbors the pilot crop for this behavior analysis was located at 5 787980 north latitude and 72 974122 longitude in the municipality of nobsa boyacá colombia according to the soil sample in this field pwp 36 60 fc 52 56 with an effective root depth of rd 90 mm and an area of 32289 87 m 2 the raw corresponded to fc pwp 100 rd 0 25 3 591 mm equivalent to 115 9 m 3 for the total area fig 6a shows the behavior of cooperative agents and fig 6b the behavior of non cooperative agents these figures show the influence of the modification factor in decision making in fig 6a if the percentage of cooperating neighbors is less than 30 the cooperative agent changes its behavior to non cooperative due to the influence of its non cooperative neighbors if the modifying factor increases the agent is more permissive and does not change to the non cooperative state furthermore if the modification factor is high the crop is not in the bulbification phase and the agent remains as cooperative as the percentage of cooperating neighbors increases the agent will remain in its cooperative status despite the change in the values of the modification factor in fig 6b if the percentage of cooperative neighbors is less than 70 the non cooperative agent remains with this behavior if the modification factor increases the agent is more permissive and depending on the value of this factor it changes to cooperative behavior the utility of the cooperative agent is generally greater than the utility of the non cooperative agent when the percentage of cooperative neighbors increases in case of a reduction in the available water the agent that initially presented cooperative behavior has the capability of sharing a water amount while the non cooperative agent requests additional water for satisfying its needs this behavior is evidenced in fig 6c and 6d for water amount requested after negotiation of the cooperative and non cooperative agents respectively in fig 6c the field agent had aw r j aw j raw 115 9 m 3 3 591 mm then it was initially cooperative with the negotiation process each cooperative agent allows the reduction of water with respect to its initial irrigation prescription according to the modification factor i fig 6c if i is low the crop is in the bulbification phase and the agent allows less water reduction with respect to i 0 3 in fig 6d the field agent has aw r j aw j where aw r j 115 9 m 3 3 591 mm and a w j 64 5 m 3 2 mm then it was initially non cooperative additionally if i is low the crop is in the bulbification phase and the agent requests more water with respect to i 0 3 for p j c higher than 40 an aspect to consider in future researches is the evaluation of other modification functions and their response to the differences between the required water and the available water 3 1 iabm wneg the software application of the irrigation agent based model for water negotiation iabm wneg was developed for studying the behavior of spatio temporal variables for water management in the usochicamocha irrigation district iabm wneg integrates geographic information systems gis site specific technical irrigation prescriptions and agent based modeling tools the negotiation protocol is performed by obtaining a new agent irrigation prescription per field and finally implementing a satisfaction algorithm fig 7 shows the graphical user interface gui of the iabm wneg software application the gui is divided into the following seven sections first the weather station allows defining and modifying the parameters of rain and reference evapotranspiration second datasetmaps allows loading and viewing the vector file data maps third the calculated maps section enables the calculation of irrigation parameters maps according to the real information on the fields fourth conflict resolution allows the calculation of cooperative and non cooperative behaviors negotiation and satisfaction factor dependent on the soil water stress fifth day simulation allows running all the procedures for obtaining the irrigation prescription after negotiation by one simulation day this option is called using a python script that improves the data obtention for analysis and plotting sixth temporal simulation allows running the simulation for several days and plot the temporal behavior of the tank level irrigation prescriptions before and after negotiation and the percentage of satisfaction response of agents seventh the environment is the region where the agents are located and where their spatial behavior is displayed it contains the pump station agent psa the weather station agent wsa the water supply agent wsua and the field agents fa j fig 8 shows the maps that can be obtained using the iabm wneg application with the information collected and mapped the irrigation rescription for the day studied can be calculated thus obtaining the irrigation prescription map in fig 9 3 2 one day irrigation negotiation performance the model performance for multiple agents was evaluated using several amounts of tsaw the maximum total water required mtwr was defined by adding the readily available water raw of all the fields in the study region using fc and pwp according to cely 2010 for the cultivation of bulb onion grown in the usochicamocha region the mad corresponds to 25 and the maximum effective root depth is 0 165 m for the san rafael irrigation unit the mtwr calculated was 40030 422 m 3 by adding all the raw amounts and taking into account the cultivated areas and a root depth of 10 cm table 4 shows the results of the simulation for six amounts of the total supply available water tsaw selected within the mtwr calculated fig 10 shows the cooperative and non cooperative behavior irrigation prescriptions after negotiation and satisfaction level of agents for the five smallest tsaw values of table 4 because aw r j a w j for tsaw values greater than 28 000 in all the fields it can be observed that the number of collaborative agents increases with the available water and it is enough for all the fields the non collaborative agents appear because the water availability for these fields was insufficient to satisfy the needs of the crops before the negotiation process when soil water is extracted by evapotranspiration the depletion increases and stress will be induced when d becomes equal to raw the water stress coefficient k s is calculated using eq 30 kokkotos et al 2020 30 k s j ta w j d j ipa n j ta w j ra w j where raw is the readily available water mm taw is the total available water mm d is the soil water deficit or net irrigation requirement mm ipan is the irrigation prescription applied after negotiation mm and j is the agent identification number corresponding to the same field number according to fig 10 if k s 1 satisfied level there is no soil water stress and the available water is within the 25 of taw purple color but if 0 k s 1 dissatisfaction levels there is a stress level in the corresponding field blue to red colors if there is water stress it is assumed that the agent is unsatisfied because the crop could have problems in its normal development if there is water scarcity and water resources are extremely low it is impossible to satisfy the needs of all the fields and there are higher levels of dissatisfaction due to values of less than one in the water stress additionally the satisfaction level also increases with the irrigation water available results highlight that the satisfied level occurs when fields have no water stress the satisfaction level scale from 0 to 1 is used as a visualization mechanism in the software application of the irrigation agent based model for water negotiation iabm wneg table 4 shows the model capability for distributing water supply amounts among the fields belonging to the san rafael pumping station the dissatisfaction appears when the tsaw is less than 40 of the mtwr which means that water prescribed per field is insufficient to maintain crops in the best conditions but at least there is a data driven criterion for the distribution of resources according to areas and crop needs for 0 25 of mtwr the simulation was run with an initial soil moisture between pwp fc pwp 2 and pwp fc pwp 2 λ for each field the constant value λ was selected at a value of 3 for obtaining random values in each field and extract a chart with the necessary characteristics for the explanation and analysis of the data thus ensuring various levels of dissatisfaction fig 10a shows that in this case all crops presented water stress and that the color scale allows knowing their severity the satisfaction level 0 corresponds to the permanent wilting point fig 11 shows the relationships between agent water requirements awr the initial available water a w 1 the available water before the negotiation process aw and the irrigation prescription after negotiation ipan per field area using 890 agents in the simulation when water resources were insufficient each agent received the acceptance for applying irrigation at a very low value which was rarely greater than the amount of aw for each one fig 11a and 11b irrigation prescriptions for the fields in this case were defined according to the cultivated area but without satisfying the irrigation needs of most fields as represented by the high difference between the awr and the ipan for each field fig 11c with 30 of tsaw shows that the negotiation algorithm became more evident when the total amount of water available increased which allowed the reduction of the prescriptions in some fields and the addition of these resources to other fields trying to satisfy their crops needs fig 11d shows that with 50 of available water there was more distribution of the resource through negotiation decisions than through allocation by the division of water by areas as there was enough water resource to negotiate several agents did not obtain the amount of water that they initially prescribed but many of them received more water than the initially available for their fields it was also observed that when the tsaw increased and was sufficient to supply the demand of the crops there was no negotiation process and these fields received the values prescribed by the iabm fig 11e one of the relevant aspects of the proposed model is that despite the water resource is much greater than the prescriptions the negotiation process ensures that the fields will use irrigation prescriptions defined with technical and agronomic criteria thus avoiding the waste of the water resource on the other hand when water resources are very small the iabm allows equitable distribution by field size and irrigation priority according to phenological states taking into account the results of figs 10 and 11 it can be stated that the iabm developed meets the requirements of seeking the satisfied level of the greatest number of agents by avoiding as much as possible that the water stress coefficient decreases from 25 of the taw k s 1 considering crop coefficients and root depths figs 10 and 11 show that when the tsaw increases the number of field agents with cooperative behavior also increases when tsaw is large enough there is no need of the negotiation procedure field agents are collaborative and 100 satisfaction will be achieved in the negotiation algorithm the principal constraint is that the sum of final prescriptions for each field after negotiation must not exceed the limit for the amount of water available throughout the region 4 conclusions in this article we showed the particular applied case of the san rafael irrigation unit of the usochicamocha irrigation district the type of information available about resources and the environment in the irrigation agent based model iabm implemented plays a key role not only in the evolution of each field agent model micro level but also in the interaction of multiple agents macro level for the indicators tested the difference seems to be associated with the availability of water for supplying all the irrigation needs and the decision mechanisms of each agent in the fields the iabm developed makes water allocation decisions based on crop coefficients root depths the soil water balance equation and weather data this tool is especially useful during water scarcity when farmers are required to make water reduction in the farm but also when the regional waste of water is a priority for sustainable resources management based on the simulations results it can be observed that the proposed model was able to save water even when water reduction is in place the results presented in this paper are very specific for several fields with bulb onion cultivation and the soil and environmental characteristics of the study region but the model is easy to implement with mixed crops and other climatic conditions for this purpose soil sampling is very important for determining hydraulic parameters such as field capacity and permanent wilting point another principal technical aspect is the characterization of crops to understand their phenological needs and their irrigation requirements during the growing season for future work the research aims to extend this model to several irrigation units of usochicamocha the calculation of water prescriptions and soil water stress values will be potentiated by the use of crop models and the integration of this system with a web application each agent can accurately formulate its crop irrigation prescriptions but in water scarcity cases it is quite possible that there is an excess of water that can be optimized from the moment of transplantation in each field daily water balance monitoring can be carried out in the iabm simulation which allows monitoring the behavior of water requirements in each field of the irrigation district the iabm allows the determination of an agent satisfaction level based on the soil water stress coefficient which is a performance indication in the water distribution of the studied fields as it is associated with the permissible soil moisture limits so that crops do not suffer damage funding this research was funded by minciencias and the department of boyacá colombia

9933,water is a common resource shared by many agents or farmers in irrigation districts where water management is therefore a very complex problem if the target is the equitable distribution of resources or the efficient use of water this paper aims to present the design and implementation of an irrigation agent based model iabm for the distribution of water in an irrigation district in the iabm proposed each field or farm can be considered as a micro level and a region or irrigation district as a macro level the most approximated irrigation scheduling at each micro level allows determining the water needs at the macro level as a reference for the negotiation of water distribution a geographical information system gis was used to manage georeferenced field information field capacity and permanent wilting point values initial soil moisture crop types crop coefficients root depth sowing dates and weather data were incorporated into the iabm model for determining irrigation prescriptions when water available in the irrigation district is insufficient to supply water requirements of all the irrigation fields the iabm allows water distribution among them according to the cultivated field sizes irrigation priorities phenological states and the behavior of neighbors when water resources are distributable the proposed negotiation algorithm ensures that fields will use irrigation prescriptions defined with technical and agronomic criteria thus avoiding the waste of water resource the iabm developed meets the satisfaction requirement of the greatest number of agents by avoiding as much as possible that the soil water stress increases using 25 of permissible level of moisture depletion respect to the total available water in each field keywords agent based model irrigation scheduling negotiation precision irrigation water sustainability 1 introduction efficient water management in agricultural crops is of paramount importance for sustainable development and food security mango et al 2018 currently climate change and water scarcity in some parts of the world urge the search for solutions that allow the optimization of agricultural processes thus obtaining higher yields with better use of resources and reduction of production costs ojha et al 2015 precision irrigation consists of sustainable water management which involves applying water to crops to meet specific plant needs adeyemi et al 2018 with the development of modern technologies a considerable transformation has been observed in many areas especially in precision agriculture applications artificial intelligence ai has acquired a major role in daily lives thus improving our perceptions and abilities to modify the environment around us talaviya et al 2020 in ai the systems called agents use reactive or rational behavior to determine actions in the surrounding environment jimenez et al 2020b an agent is an autonomous entity which obtains information from the environment using a perception system makes decisions through strategies and carries out actions to modify the environment using actuators russell and norvig 2016 irrigation districts are complex systems farmers can be considered as adaptive agents who have autonomy intelligence and relative knowledge about their environment crop fields an et al 2005 these agents can update their knowledge and adjust their behaviors to the environment change farmers are interconnected through social relationships with irrigation management authorities and also with their neighbors the interactions between farmers could lead to patterns at the aggregate level as conflict resolution through negotiation coordination cooperation and competition in the distribution of water resources cai and xiong 2017 multi agent systems mas are developed by the interaction of several agents that exchange information between them and generally cooperate for solving problems the role of an agent in mas consists of its nature interfaces responsibilities functions and behaviors agent based modeling abm is a type of mas whose aim is to use rules of the local agents in the micro level for finding a collective behavior of several agents in a macro level using modeling analysis and simulation grashey jansen 2014 researches have used abm to model relationships between the micro and macro levels and to infer or make decisions based on different ai techniques or expert knowledge emergence is a term associated to an unexpected behavior that appears during the algorithms execution and was not defined by the programmer in the agents design specification the abm models capture these emerging phenomena and obtain a complete overview of the system abm applications have been used in crop modeling irrigation management systems matthews 2006 water management policies in irrigation systems rege et al 2015 resource negotiation processes janssen and baggio 2016 emulation of irrigation water resource monitoring zhao et al 2011 and simulation of large scale irrigation models primarily by flood irrigation guyennon et al 2016 competition for the use of water is increasing globally and the development of models that allow simulating views of the competing parties are necessary to negotiate water resources and mitigate conflicts abm models have also been used as a conflict resolution strategy for the management of irrigation resources between stakeholders akhbari and grigg 2013 explain the development of an abm that takes into account the interactions among the parties and how they can be encouraged to cooperate in the game to work toward a solution cai and xiong 2017 implemented an abm simulation for studying cooperation formation when irrigation is used the stakeholder first becomes a potential participant when the cost of cooperation it needs to cover is not higher than the amount it can afford or is willing to pay on top of this the propensity that the stakeholder participates is heavily affected by its personal characteristics and neighborhood effects finally belaqziz et al 2014 implemented an abm simulation focused on gravity irrigation systems with an evolutionary strategy algorithm for the distribution in rate and time of water resources in a pilot region located in morocco several researches have applied multi agent models to study water distribution in cultivated regions with several stakeholders but none have used neither crop phenological characteristics as a relevant negotiation parameter nor agent satisfaction levels as irrigation performance measurement in the design of intelligent agents additionally the use of crop characteristics and neighbor behaviors for negotiation and water distribution introduces proactive and social behaviors in the irrigation agents of the abm proposed in this paper which can be implemented with real devices in crop fields jimenez et al 2020b for more details about multi agent systems and their applications to irrigation management please refer to the previous work by jimenez et al 2020a this paper shows the design and implementation of an irrigation agent based model iabm for the large scale irrigation and drainage district of chicamocha and firavitoba usochicamocha in boyacá colombia where water is a common resource shared by many agents this district is currently comprised of eleven irrigation units that benefit about 4000 ha of 6087 potentials irrigation waters are taken from the chicamocha riverbed and carried to the fields through pumping stations since the implementation of the district in 1998 the bulb onion cultivation has emerged as an alternative of commercial agriculture under irrigation looking for the agricultural reconversion of lands considered for use in livestock the establishment of productive systems with the use of irrigation has caused difficulties and shortcomings mainly due to the lack of knowledge of the biophysical and technological components associated with the use of water in the exploitation of horticultural crops especially the bulb onion whose planting area in the district has reached more than 2000 ha per year 1000 per semester cycle the specific problem of the usochicamocha irrigation district is the physical and hydraulic infrastructure which is considered adequate for the distribution of land irrigation but becomes inefficient due to the non application of technical criteria with concepts that indicate when how much and how to irrigate cely 2010 a characteristic of the proposed iabm is the management of local information in the cultivated fields farmers are simulated as intelligent agents with the capability of determining water requirements based on the soil water balance equation and field data as soil textures and soil hydrologic parameters additionally the iabm system is implemented with social capabilities represented by cooperative and non cooperative behaviors among neighbors agents and the ability to negotiate the distribution of resources when there is not enough water to maintain all the cultivated plots at field capacity after the negotiation procedure the agents apply irrigation to their crops according to new prescriptions that seek to optimize the distribution of irrigation in the study region where the system was implemented the contribution of this work is an agent based modelling framework specifically designed for the management of water resources in an irrigation district including the representation of collective decision making procedures with the integration of real geographical and weather data python algorithms and netlogo this framework allows the negotiation of water resources in an irrigation district taking into account the emerging behavior from the micro farmers to macro irrigation district levels for the efficient management of freshwater in agriculture as one of the most important resources for the humanity subsistence 2 materials and methods this research was developed in the large scale irrigation and drainage district of chicamocha and firavitoba usochicamocha located in boyacá colombia the division of the territory belonging to the usochicamocha irrigation district was defined by the territorial arrangement planning tap of the department of boyacá colombia this governmental body divided the district into eleven territorial sectors adjacent to the riverbed of the chicamocha river to guide and manage the physical development of the territory and the use of the land these territorial sectors defined in the tap coincide with the established fields in the irrigation units without considering the spatial heterogeneities of the soils however climatic conditions of these irrigation units are homogeneous given their spatial proximity temperature relative humidity rainfall and altitude level therefore the district has eleven irrigation units with one pumping station each holanda surba pantano de vargas ayalas duitama cuche san rafael las vueltas tibasosa ministerio and monquirá fig 1 the water sources are la copa and la playa dams and water is distributed throughout the chicamocha riverbed each pumping station is responsible for supplying water to several fields the experimental fields used in this study corresponded to the san rafael irrigation unit that has an area of 8451 3 k m 2 and is located in 5 789569 n 72 988214 w fig 1 shows the cultivated fields supplied by the san rafael pumping station located in the municipality of nobsa boyacá colombia the area comprised by the san rafael irrigation unit has an annual average of solar brightness of 1852 hours and an average temperature of 14 05 c with a high qualification for the sowing of agricultural species weather spark 2020 there is a humidity deficit of 485 mm year derived from an annual average of rainfall and evaporation rates of 798 mm year and 1283 mm year respectively the environmental climate corresponds to dry cold with a bimodal regime and a water deficit in most of the months with a concentration of rains between of april and may in the first semester and october to november in the second according to 10 year data cely 2010 2 1 crop characterization bulb onion the bulb onion crop allium cepa hybrid yellow granex is the principal product planted in usochicamocha for this study parameters and characteristics of this crop were defined using the results of the project entitled determination of irrigation and drainage parameters for the cultivation of bulb onion allium cepa in soils of the alto chicamocha irrigation district boyacá colombia cod 1c10937819630 supported by the administrative department of science technology and innovation of colombia colciencias and finished in 2009 according to this research three phenological phases were defined for the development of this crop phase i leaves development it is characterized by a minimal accumulation of phytomass and no very noticeable changes in the phenotype this phase begins from transplantation to the beginning of bulbification plants develop 58 of the total leaves acquire 48 of its maximum height and 45 of the maximum number of cataphiles and 63 of the maximum length of the root are formed these values are significant for a single phase which corresponds to 40 of the total cultivation cycle in this phenological state the plant presents a gradual and constant increase in its growth and number of cells of meristematic tissues besides several small and thin leaves appear as well as very fine roots and cataphiles phase ii bulbification this stage is characterized by an increase in most of the physiological parameters in which a representative growth is observed at the beginning of this phase the thickening of the base of the leaves begins the number of cataphiles increases and leaves continue to appear the leaf area increases because its length increases in width and length and a thickening process occurs in the limb and therefore in the pseudostem in the fullness of the phase the equatorial diameter of the onion bulbs increases to exceed 65 of its final diameter the fresh and dry bulb phytomass show a drastic change and the leaves remain erect in the fullness and end of the phase the total dry phytomass increases because all the organs are presenting significant changes in length thickness and stored products of photosynthesis phase iii ripening in this last phase which goes until the harvest or maturity of the crop the highest rate of accumulation of dry and fresh phytomass of the bulb stands out the bulb completes its filling and the rate of appearance of cataphiles decreases as they are thickening to consolidate the final formation of the bulb the leaf part loses importance since the foliar area and the number of leaves remain constant and low at the end of this phase the leaves die after the plants are overwhelmed which basically consists in drying the bulb neck and as a result the plant falls due to the weight of its leaves it is observed that the water consumption of the crop is higher in the second stage of development in addition to a shorter duration in days this corresponds to the phase where the greatest accumulations of biomass occur and the organs develop that is the critical period of the onion bulb cultivation matches the formation of the bulb a stage in which it consumes 47 of its water needs the water requirements in a crop are directly related to the evapotranspiration et corresponding to the water that the plant uses to carry out its physiological functions including that which the plant expels through the leaves transpiration that which is lost from the soil where the crop is evaporation and the water intercepted by the foliage allen et al 1998 e t r is the calculated reference et for grass mm once e t r has been calculated a crop coefficient value k c must be multiplied by e t r for adjusting the value to the studied crop in its different development stages subedi and chávez 2015 the crop water requirements are expressed in millimeters either per day month or vegetative cycle the definition of the phenological scale and k c for the study area are fundamental parameters to carry out the irrigation programming that is required to be applied at each stage of the crop the crop coefficient describes the variations in the amount of water that plants extract from the soil as they develop from sowing to harvest as it depends on the anatomical morphological and physiological plant characteristics spiliotopoulos and loukas 2019 due to the characteristics of the bulb onion crop and the variations in the incidence of e t r during the different growth stages k c changes from planting to harvest according to cely 2010 onion plants have abundant thin roots measuring around 40 mm at the transplanting time from the third week after transplanting the length of the roots begins to increase and consequently their weight subsequently a significant increase in the number of roots is evident becoming abundant without interrupting its growth in length from week 8 onwards a thickening of the roots occurs around week 15 at the beginning of the maturation phase the roots stop growing reaching approximately 165 mm in length and maintain a constant dry weight until the end of the cultivation cycle table 1 shows site specific values of k c effective root depth r d and e t c for the fields located in the san rafael irrigation unit of usochicamocha and defined for bulb onion allium cepa hybrid yellow granex 2 2 field data collection table 2 describes the data sources used in this study daily meteorological data of precipitation pressure maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed radiation evapotranspiration and relative humidity were collected from a davis growweather station with weather wizard iii console davis instruments hayward ca usa located in a field of the san rafael irrigation unit 5 787021 n 72 973932 from november 1 2019 to august 01 2020 precipitation and reference evapotranspiration e t r data were used as input parameters for the hydric balance equation rain was measured and e t r was computed on hourly time step throughout the 24 h period and summed up to a daily time step the effective precipitation was calculated through the methodology stated by adnan and khan 2009 where a k p coefficient is obtained from the relationship between evapotranspiration and the observed precipitation by using eq 1 then the k p coefficient is multiplied by the observed precipitation and the result is equal to the effective precipitation as expressed in eq 2 1 k p 1 011 e 0 001143 e t r ra in 1 011 e 0 5208 e t r rain 2 rai n eff rain k p where k p dimensionless is the precipitation coefficient e t r mm is the reference evapotranspiration rain mm is the precipitation and rai n eff mm is the effective precipitation taking as reference the semi detailed soil study at scale 1 25000 of usochicamocha cely 2010 a total of 100 sites were geo referenced and used for defining textural physical and hydraulic parameters maps the geographical distribution of these sites represents the contrast of the soil pattern and climatic distribution of the area occupied by bulb onion in the usochicamocha district in this study soil maps were prepared with spatial indicators including textures apparent density total porosity and its distribution saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture points saturation fc and pwp these maps were obtained by ordinary kriging interpolation in quantum gis osgeo beaverton or usa and saga dept of physical geography university of hamburg ger the procedure consisted of a structural analysis that evaluated data correlation and dependency through a variogram and a predictive analysis using ordinary kriging arétouyap et al 2015 currently kriging is the best interpolation technique because it is unbiased nevertheless it requires data to be correlated and dependent this structural analysis is conducted by means of the variogram a variogram is a tool that is used to describe the spatial continuity of a phenomenon caridad and jury 2013 the variogram provides a measure of spatial correlation by describing how the sample data are related to distance and direction kaluzny et al 1998 in order to apply the kriging procedure the variogram should be fitted to a simplified model parameters that describe the variogram with sufficient detail are nugget sill and range the spherical model is the most common model in geostatistics and it was selected and implemented using eq 3 3 γ h 0 h 0 c 0 c 1 5 h a 0 5 h a 3 0 h a c 0 c h a where γ h is the variogram h is the offset c 0 is the nugget variance c 0 c is the sill scale c is the partial sill variance and a is the effective range arétouyap et al 2015 semivariograms were used for understanding the spatial dependence for each spatial indicator for each indicator nugget sill and range were defined for the spherical model and the results of the kriging ordinary interpolation were evaluated using the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse according to table 3 fig 2 shows the interpolated maps for field capacity and permanent wilting point for the management of spatial data a polygon layer was developed with all the fields belonging to the san rafael irrigation unit fig 2 zone statistics tool in qgis was used to extract the values of the interpolation maps raster data to the polygon layer these values correspond to the average amount of pixels of the interpolation maps that belong to each field polygon of each spatial indicator finally the geospatial information was organized in a vector file in shape format shp and a dbf file with fields of latitude and longitude of polygon centroid field area sand loam and clay percentages apparent density saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil moisture points saturation fc and pwp this vector layer corresponds to the spatial parameters that are constant in the study region and represent the invariant aspects of the environment in the proposed agent based model 2 3 irrigation prescription a precision irrigation prescription implies watering in such a way that it represents the necessary humidity to obtain optimum yields the total available water taw is the quantity of water that can be stored in the soil and used by crops barradas et al 2012 taw is defined by using the field capacity fc and the permanent wilting point pwp parameters eq 4 4 taw vw c fc vw c pwp 100 r d where vw c fc is the volumetric water content at fc vw c pwp is the volumetric water content at pwp and r d is the effective root depth in mm the fc is related to the quantity of water that a soil can retain after saturation caused by rain or irrigation activities with free drainage and without losses by evaporation until the soil moisture stabilizes the pwp is the point under which a plant cannot extract water from the soil and cannot recover from the loss of water even if water is applied again ghorbani et al 2017 in the iabm irrigation scheduling must be evaluated for each field belonging to the san rafael irrigation unit of usochicamocha the management of irrigation prescriptions in the iabm is used to keep each field within a soil moisture range defined by the percentage of permissible level of moisture depletion mad if the soil is sufficiently wet it supplies water fast enough to meet the atmospheric demand of the crop and keep water uptake equal to etc the knowledge of the initial soil water content in the effective root zone e t c taw rain and irrigation amount on the specific day are necessary for applying the soil water balance equation irrigation is required when e t c exceeds the water supply the net irrigation d is the difference between fc and the current soil volumetric water content in the field deep percolation p mm and runoff ro mm are difficult to estimate assuming that irr and rai n eff readily infiltrate into the soil and discarding ro and p the net irrigation is calculated using eq 5 5 d d 1 irr rai n eff e t c if d is negative then set it to 0 0 where d m m is the soil water deficit or net irrigation requirement d 1 mm is the soil water deficit on the previous day irr mm is the irrigation amount for the current day rai n eff mm is the effective precipitation for the current day and e t c mm is the crop evapotranspiration or crop water requirement for the current day the unit mm means cubic meters of water per square meter of soil the term d is set equal to zero if its value becomes negative when precipitation and or irrigation exceed d 1 plus e t c this means that water added to the soil exceeds field capacity within the plant root zone any water excess in the root zone is assumed to be lost through ro or p andales et al 2011 the irrigation method efficiency ef 60 for surface irrigation 75 for sprinkler irrigation and 90 for drip irrigation is added in the calculus in eq 6 6 d t d 100 ef where d t is the total irrigation mm d is the net irrigation mm and ef is the field application efficiency finally the irrigation time is determined using eq 7 7 irrigation time it d t irrigation application rate the mad is used as a threshold value for defining the irrigation timing associated to the soil water depletion from the fc to the current vwc to enable a crop to extract water from the root zone without suffering water stress only the readily available water raw of the total available water taw is allowed to be depleted as shown in eq 8 al kaisi et al 2009 8 raw taw mad 100 the raw is used as a guide for deciding when to irrigate whenever d raw this condition avoids water stress in the crop and does not depend on the capabilities of the irrigation system 2 4 agent modeling language and framework the multi agent programmable modeling environment netlogo was used for the iabm development jaxa rozen et al 2019 netlogo allows the implementation of the fipa specifications foundation for intelligent physical agent the framework uses two extra libraries one for belief desires and intentions agent architecture bdi and one for agent communication language acl that allows the development of goal oriented agents that communicate using fipa acl messages sakellariou et al 2008 netlogo was selected because it allows the use of geographical information layers and connectivity with hardware devices and algorithms developed in python3 wilensky and rand 2015 turtles patches links and the observer are different types of agents or entities in netlogo these agents are able to carry out their own activities and follow instructions at the same time turtles are the beings that move around the world the grid of patches the world is two dimensional and it is divided into a grid of patches each patch is a squared region of terrain on which the turtles can move the patches have coordinates and cannot move but they may have similar properties to those of turtles the links are the agents that connect two turtles finally the observer has no place in the terrain as it is looking at the world of turtles and patches and controls the experiment each patch and turtle can have their own user defined variables thus allowing the simulation of complex environments according to the abm methodology proposed by wilensky and rand 2015 the first phase is the multi agent framework design which takes into account the spatial distribution interactions and relationships that can exist between the agents the iabm proposed consists of the integration of the supervising planning subsystem and the customer subsystem the supervising planning subsystem sps is responsible for monitoring the irrigation agent status definition of prescription maps using field data mapping using global information and coordination of conflict resolution between agents in the sps the pump station agent psa the weather station agent wsa and the water supply agent wsua interact the customer subsystem is constituted by field agents fa j in charge of the irrigation prescription and the application of water resources where j is the number of the field corresponding to the fa these types of agents accomplish together a fully functional abm with capabilities of autonomy coordination deliberation conflict resolution and decision making the agent modeling language aml is used for specifying the agent roles behavioral aspects and interactions between agents cervenka et al 2005 entities in aml correspond to agents resources environments or organizations designated to explicitly represent various mas society abstractions an organization is a specialized environment type in the iabm the iabm organization is specified in the model of the class level organization structure fig 3 for the external perspective the organization represents an autonomous entity the organization behavior consists on the one hand in the emergent properties and behavior of their agents their mutual relationships observations and interactions and on the other hand in the features and behavior of the entity as a whole for the internal perspective organization units are types of environments specified by structures interactions roles constraints rules among other elements cervenka et al 2005 additionally agents act not only in isolation but also in cooperation or coordination with other agents the resources in the iabm are the water and the information stored in the databases fig 3 shows a class diagram depicting the generic organization structure of the san rafael pump station in the usochicamocha irrigation district the organization comprises a psa agent of the pumpstation entity role type a wsua agent of the watersupply entity role

entity role type a ps agent of the perceptionsystem entity role type and an iae agent of the irrigationactivationemulation entity role type the number of fa agents n depends on the number of simulated fields 2 4 1 sequence diagram the sequence diagram is used for modeling the interactions between agents with this representation it is possible to illustrate how the different agents of the iabm system interact with each other to carry out the irrigation management and the order in which these interactions are performed for the san rafael irrigation pump station crop fields were defined according to the usochicamocha cartographic map a lifeline represents an individual participant in the sequence diagram and it is shown using a rectangle for its head followed by a vertical dashed line that represents the lifetime of the participant participants in the proposed iabm are the psa wsua wsa fa 1 fa n fig 4 synchronous messages between lifelines were defined the sender waits for the receiver to process the message and returns an answer before carrying on with another message synchronous messages between lifelines were defined the sender waits for the receiver to process the message and returns before carrying on with another message in each irrigation event the pump station agent requests from the wsua the total supply available water tsaw each fa requests rain and reference evapotranspiration data to the wsa all the fas plan irrigation and determine the amount of water they required from wsua at this stage the fas do not actually perform irrigation and only send these values to the psa the psa verifies that the tsaw is sufficient for the water demand the psa verifies that the tsaw is sufficient for the water demand if this is not the case the psa performs the conflict resolution protocol and finally sends the final irrigation scheduling to the fas who carry out the irrigation application the model was adjusted according to crop water requirements soil parameters and the characteristics of the san rafael irrigation unit of usochicamocha the abm implemented in netlogo acquires information about the environment using the vector dataset stored in a shp file afterwards each fa determines its irrigation prescription using its local information such as soil characteristics crops and sowing date and climatic parameters such as rainfall and reference evapotranspiration the total water required twr amount is defined as the sum of all the individual agent water requirements awr it is calculated with the irrigation prescriptions for each field in the region covered by the san rafael irrigation unit using eq 9 9 twr j 1 n aw r j where j represents each field monitored by an agent and aw r j is the water requirement defined by the agent in charge of the field j the total supply available water tsaw for the fields belonging to the san rafael irrigation unit is the total available water that can be used in an irrigation event the tsaw is set by the wsua agent the available water per field area a w j is defined using each field area f a j and eq 10 10 a w j tsaw j n f a j f a j the supply and demand relationships are determined by subtracting the twr from the tsaw eq 11 11 odr tsaw twr on the one hand if odr 0 there is a conflict resolution protocol based on the negotiation of water resources between agents which represents cooperation between them on the other hand if odr 0 there is no need for negotiation between agents which means that there are no cooperation events and field agents receive authorization for applying their initial prescriptions initially in the negotiation process if an agent j has a w j aw r j it is cooperative c otherwise the agent is non cooperative nc the water distribution protocol begins with the assignation of a w j equal to aw r j for cooperative agents for each cooperative agent j there is a saved water amount s w j c defined using eq 12 12 s w j c a w j c aw r j c and aw r j c a w j c 13 t s w s w j c the total saved water amount tsw is defined by the sum of all the s w j c according to eq 13 the new total available water for non cooperative agents ntaw nc is obtained by adding tsw to the total available water of the non cooperative agents using eq 14 and it is distributed between the non cooperative agents according to each irrigation area using eq 15 14 ntaw nc a w j nc tsw 15 a w j nc ntaw nc f a j nc f a j nc at the end of this procedure there is a new cooperative c and non cooperative nc assignation to all the field agents if an agent j has a w j aw r j it is cooperative c otherwise the agent is non cooperative nc eqs 12 15 are repeated until the quantity of tsw 0 or the number of non cooperative agents is equal to zero the last case occurs if the resources are enough to satisfy the needs of all the fields in this case there is no negotiation all the agents can use the irrigation prescription defined and agents are cooperative those assignments are used for defining the proportion of neighbors of agent j with cooperative c and non cooperative nc behaviors utility functions were defined using eqs 16 19 according to the model developed by edwards et al 2005 which is inspired in the sociologic diffusion model for water domains the decision of an agent to change its cooperative or non cooperative behavior in the negotiation process relies on a trade off between social pressure and personal interest social pressure is related to the behavior of neighboring agents while the personal interest is related to the goal of the agent to apply the necessary water according to the phenological state of the plants in order to ensure the best production in its field 16 ψ j c c a p j c i 17 ψ j c nc 1 a 1 p j c 18 ψ j nc c c p j c i 19 ψ j nc nc 1 c 1 p j c where ψ j c c is the utility function defined for maintaining the cooperation status of the agent j ψ j c nc is the utility function defined when an agent j changes from cooperation status to non cooperation status ψ j nc c is the utility function defined when an agent j changes from non cooperation status to cooperation status and ψ j nc nc is the utility function defined for maintaining the non cooperation status of agent j p j c is the proportion of neighbors of agent j of cooperative behavior c the proportion of neighbors for each behavior was calculated using netlogo by defining the number of neighbors in a radius r from the centroid of each polygon feature of the shapefile that corresponds to the location of each agent when agents remain in their current behavior c c or nc nc a 1 c 0 7 on the contrary when agents change to the opposite behavior c nc or nc c 1 a c 0 3 according to akhbari and grigg 2013 i is an operator related to the environment and the field agents and serves as a modification factor that is a function of water requirements according to the phenological status of crops the maximum value of the utility function is 1 and the maximum value of i is 0 3 this value was obtained by solving eq 16 when all the neighbors are collaborative p j c 1 and the maximum value of ψ j c c 1 0 7 1 i as it is the highest utility value that can be obtained using eqs 16 19 the proposed modification factor function decreases linearly from the beginning of the crop development phase 0 3 to the beginning of the mid season or bulbification phase for bulb onion 0 0 once the bulbification phase is finished the utility function increases linearly until the end of the late season or ripening phase for bulb onion 0 3 according to this function the priority irrigation is performed in the bulbification phase as it is the critical period in bulb onion cultivation hence there will be no pressure on the agent to cooperate and the agent might only be influenced by its neighbors the linear behavior is established in the transitions between the phases of leaves development to bulbification and bulbification to ripening as it is the simplest function to represent the changes which is inversely proportional to the behavior of the crop coefficient during the plant development of a crop according to fao 2020 fig 5 the utility function ψ j corresponds to the one with the highest value taking into account whether the agent was initially cooperative eqs 16 and 17 or non cooperative eqs 18 and 19 a study on onion irrigation in southwest texas found that reducing the amount of applied water to 75 of the recommended level resulted in a moderate reduction in marketable yield in addition this condition showed a substantial reduction in the number of larger bulbs sizes leskovar et al 2012 the recommended agricultural management to produce better shape index of onion bulbs is to irrigate onion plants using irrigation level between 80 and 100 of water requirements mubarak and hamdan 2018 if the agent is cooperative in the proposed method ra w j c 2 is the maximum water amount that it is willing to compromise in the negotiation process that corresponds to maintain the soil at 87 5 of water requirements by applying the i factor and calculating the fas utilities ψ j the demand modification amount for the cooperative agent i j c is defined using eq 20 20 i j c ra w j c 2 1 ψ j then the new demand of agent j naw r j c is calculated using eq 21 21 n a w r j c 0 j a w r j c 0 r a w j c 2 i j c j a w r j c 0 the total offer modification amount for the cooperative agents ti is defined by the sum of all the i j c according to eq 22 22 ti i j c the new total available water for the non cooperative agents ntaw nc is obtained by adding ti to the total available water of the non cooperative agents using eq 23 and it is distributed between the non cooperative agents according to each irrigation area using eq 24 23 ntaw nc a w j nc ti 24 a w j nc ntaw nc f a j nc f a j nc at this stage the negotiation process is developed only with the non cooperative agents aw r j nc a w j nc is the maximum water demand for the non cooperative agent j by applying the i factor for non cooperative agents and calculating the fas utilities ψ j the demand modification amount i j nc is defined using eq 25 25 i j n c a w r j n c a w j n c 1 ψ j j a w r j n c a w j n c 0 j a w r j n c a w j n c then the new demand of agent j naw r j nc is calculated using eq 26 26 n a w r j n c 0 j a w r j n c 0 a w j n c i j n c j a w r j n c 0 the non cooperative total new demand tnd nc is calculated by adding all the naw r j nc according to eq 27 27 tnd nc naw r j nc while ntaw nc tnd nc there is an iterative process of water reduction w a j m 3 according to a water amount ρ mm and the field area m 2 by field agent until tsaw tnd for all the cooperative and non cooperative agents using eqs 28 and 29 28 w a j nc f a j nc ρ 29 naw r j nc naw r j nc w a j nc while ntaw tnd there is an iterative process of water distribution of ntaw tnd between all the cooperative and non cooperative agents according to each irrigation area where if naw r j aw r j then naw r j aw r j according to this algorithm the non cooperative field agents demand more water however this new demand could be less than the initially requested and will depend on the behavior of the neighbors and how they cooperate or not in the distribution of the resource at the end of the negotiation stage the total supply available water tsaw amount has to be more than or equal to the total new demand tnd in addition after the negotiation if naw r j a w j then naw r j a w j finally the irrigation agents can define irrigation events but they cannot apply water to their fields without the coordinator agent permission 3 results and discussion the iabm field agents obtain data from their fields define irrigation prescriptions and in the supervising planning subsystem sps the conflict resolution protocol is developed for the distribution of water resources according to the total available water fig 6a and 6b show the behavior of the utility function for the field agents according to changes in the modification factor with respect to the percentage of cooperative neighbors the pilot crop for this behavior analysis was located at 5 787980 north latitude and 72 974122 longitude in the municipality of nobsa boyacá colombia according to the soil sample in this field pwp 36 60 fc 52 56 with an effective root depth of rd 90 mm and an area of 32289 87 m 2 the raw corresponded to fc pwp 100 rd 0 25 3 591 mm equivalent to 115 9 m 3 for the total area fig 6a shows the behavior of cooperative agents and fig 6b the behavior of non cooperative agents these figures show the influence of the modification factor in decision making in fig 6a if the percentage of cooperating neighbors is less than 30 the cooperative agent changes its behavior to non cooperative due to the influence of its non cooperative neighbors if the modifying factor increases the agent is more permissive and does not change to the non cooperative state furthermore if the modification factor is high the crop is not in the bulbification phase and the agent remains as cooperative as the percentage of cooperating neighbors increases the agent will remain in its cooperative status despite the change in the values of the modification factor in fig 6b if the percentage of cooperative neighbors is less than 70 the non cooperative agent remains with this behavior if the modification factor increases the agent is more permissive and depending on the value of this factor it changes to cooperative behavior the utility of the cooperative agent is generally greater than the utility of the non cooperative agent when the percentage of cooperative neighbors increases in case of a reduction in the available water the agent that initially presented cooperative behavior has the capability of sharing a water amount while the non cooperative agent requests additional water for satisfying its needs this behavior is evidenced in fig 6c and 6d for water amount requested after negotiation of the cooperative and non cooperative agents respectively in fig 6c the field agent had aw r j aw j raw 115 9 m 3 3 591 mm then it was initially cooperative with the negotiation process each cooperative agent allows the reduction of water with respect to its initial irrigation prescription according to the modification factor i fig 6c if i is low the crop is in the bulbification phase and the agent allows less water reduction with respect to i 0 3 in fig 6d the field agent has aw r j aw j where aw r j 115 9 m 3 3 591 mm and a w j 64 5 m 3 2 mm then it was initially non cooperative additionally if i is low the crop is in the bulbification phase and the agent requests more water with respect to i 0 3 for p j c higher than 40 an aspect to consider in future researches is the evaluation of other modification functions and their response to the differences between the required water and the available water 3 1 iabm wneg the software application of the irrigation agent based model for water negotiation iabm wneg was developed for studying the behavior of spatio temporal variables for water management in the usochicamocha irrigation district iabm wneg integrates geographic information systems gis site specific technical irrigation prescriptions and agent based modeling tools the negotiation protocol is performed by obtaining a new agent irrigation prescription per field and finally implementing a satisfaction algorithm fig 7 shows the graphical user interface gui of the iabm wneg software application the gui is divided into the following seven sections first the weather station allows defining and modifying the parameters of rain and reference evapotranspiration second datasetmaps allows loading and viewing the vector file data maps third the calculated maps section enables the calculation of irrigation parameters maps according to the real information on the fields fourth conflict resolution allows the calculation of cooperative and non cooperative behaviors negotiation and satisfaction factor dependent on the soil water stress fifth day simulation allows running all the procedures for obtaining the irrigation prescription after negotiation by one simulation day this option is called using a python script that improves the data obtention for analysis and plotting sixth temporal simulation allows running the simulation for several days and plot the temporal behavior of the tank level irrigation prescriptions before and after negotiation and the percentage of satisfaction response of agents seventh the environment is the region where the agents are located and where their spatial behavior is displayed it contains the pump station agent psa the weather station agent wsa the water supply agent wsua and the field agents fa j fig 8 shows the maps that can be obtained using the iabm wneg application with the information collected and mapped the irrigation rescription for the day studied can be calculated thus obtaining the irrigation prescription map in fig 9 3 2 one day irrigation negotiation performance the model performance for multiple agents was evaluated using several amounts of tsaw the maximum total water required mtwr was defined by adding the readily available water raw of all the fields in the study region using fc and pwp according to cely 2010 for the cultivation of bulb onion grown in the usochicamocha region the mad corresponds to 25 and the maximum effective root depth is 0 165 m for the san rafael irrigation unit the mtwr calculated was 40030 422 m 3 by adding all the raw amounts and taking into account the cultivated areas and a root depth of 10 cm table 4 shows the results of the simulation for six amounts of the total supply available water tsaw selected within the mtwr calculated fig 10 shows the cooperative and non cooperative behavior irrigation prescriptions after negotiation and satisfaction level of agents for the five smallest tsaw values of table 4 because aw r j a w j for tsaw values greater than 28 000 in all the fields it can be observed that the number of collaborative agents increases with the available water and it is enough for all the fields the non collaborative agents appear because the water availability for these fields was insufficient to satisfy the needs of the crops before the negotiation process when soil water is extracted by evapotranspiration the depletion increases and stress will be induced when d becomes equal to raw the water stress coefficient k s is calculated using eq 30 kokkotos et al 2020 30 k s j ta w j d j ipa n j ta w j ra w j where raw is the readily available water mm taw is the total available water mm d is the soil water deficit or net irrigation requirement mm ipan is the irrigation prescription applied after negotiation mm and j is the agent identification number corresponding to the same field number according to fig 10 if k s 1 satisfied level there is no soil water stress and the available water is within the 25 of taw purple color but if 0 k s 1 dissatisfaction levels there is a stress level in the corresponding field blue to red colors if there is water stress it is assumed that the agent is unsatisfied because the crop could have problems in its normal development if there is water scarcity and water resources are extremely low it is impossible to satisfy the needs of all the fields and there are higher levels of dissatisfaction due to values of less than one in the water stress additionally the satisfaction level also increases with the irrigation water available results highlight that the satisfied level occurs when fields have no water stress the satisfaction level scale from 0 to 1 is used as a visualization mechanism in the software application of the irrigation agent based model for water negotiation iabm wneg table 4 shows the model capability for distributing water supply amounts among the fields belonging to the san rafael pumping station the dissatisfaction appears when the tsaw is less than 40 of the mtwr which means that water prescribed per field is insufficient to maintain crops in the best conditions but at least there is a data driven criterion for the distribution of resources according to areas and crop needs for 0 25 of mtwr the simulation was run with an initial soil moisture between pwp fc pwp 2 and pwp fc pwp 2 λ for each field the constant value λ was selected at a value of 3 for obtaining random values in each field and extract a chart with the necessary characteristics for the explanation and analysis of the data thus ensuring various levels of dissatisfaction fig 10a shows that in this case all crops presented water stress and that the color scale allows knowing their severity the satisfaction level 0 corresponds to the permanent wilting point fig 11 shows the relationships between agent water requirements awr the initial available water a w 1 the available water before the negotiation process aw and the irrigation prescription after negotiation ipan per field area using 890 agents in the simulation when water resources were insufficient each agent received the acceptance for applying irrigation at a very low value which was rarely greater than the amount of aw for each one fig 11a and 11b irrigation prescriptions for the fields in this case were defined according to the cultivated area but without satisfying the irrigation needs of most fields as represented by the high difference between the awr and the ipan for each field fig 11c with 30 of tsaw shows that the negotiation algorithm became more evident when the total amount of water available increased which allowed the reduction of the prescriptions in some fields and the addition of these resources to other fields trying to satisfy their crops needs fig 11d shows that with 50 of available water there was more distribution of the resource through negotiation decisions than through allocation by the division of water by areas as there was enough water resource to negotiate several agents did not obtain the amount of water that they initially prescribed but many of them received more water than the initially available for their fields it was also observed that when the tsaw increased and was sufficient to supply the demand of the crops there was no negotiation process and these fields received the values prescribed by the iabm fig 11e one of the relevant aspects of the proposed model is that despite the water resource is much greater than the prescriptions the negotiation process ensures that the fields will use irrigation prescriptions defined with technical and agronomic criteria thus avoiding the waste of the water resource on the other hand when water resources are very small the iabm allows equitable distribution by field size and irrigation priority according to phenological states taking into account the results of figs 10 and 11 it can be stated that the iabm developed meets the requirements of seeking the satisfied level of the greatest number of agents by avoiding as much as possible that the water stress coefficient decreases from 25 of the taw k s 1 considering crop coefficients and root depths figs 10 and 11 show that when the tsaw increases the number of field agents with cooperative behavior also increases when tsaw is large enough there is no need of the negotiation procedure field agents are collaborative and 100 satisfaction will be achieved in the negotiation algorithm the principal constraint is that the sum of final prescriptions for each field after negotiation must not exceed the limit for the amount of water available throughout the region 4 conclusions in this article we showed the particular applied case of the san rafael irrigation unit of the usochicamocha irrigation district the type of information available about resources and the environment in the irrigation agent based model iabm implemented plays a key role not only in the evolution of each field agent model micro level but also in the interaction of multiple agents macro level for the indicators tested the difference seems to be associated with the availability of water for supplying all the irrigation needs and the decision mechanisms of each agent in the fields the iabm developed makes water allocation decisions based on crop coefficients root depths the soil water balance equation and weather data this tool is especially useful during water scarcity when farmers are required to make water reduction in the farm but also when the regional waste of water is a priority for sustainable resources management based on the simulations results it can be observed that the proposed model was able to save water even when water reduction is in place the results presented in this paper are very specific for several fields with bulb onion cultivation and the soil and environmental characteristics of the study region but the model is easy to implement with mixed crops and other climatic conditions for this purpose soil sampling is very important for determining hydraulic parameters such as field capacity and permanent wilting point another principal technical aspect is the characterization of crops to understand their phenological needs and their irrigation requirements during the growing season for future work the research aims to extend this model to several irrigation units of usochicamocha the calculation of water prescriptions and soil water stress values will be potentiated by the use of crop models and the integration of this system with a web application each agent can accurately formulate its crop irrigation prescriptions but in water scarcity cases it is quite possible that there is an excess of water that can be optimized from the moment of transplantation in each field daily water balance monitoring can be carried out in the iabm simulation which allows monitoring the behavior of water requirements in each field of the irrigation district the iabm allows the determination of an agent satisfaction level based on the soil water stress coefficient which is a performance indication in the water distribution of the studied fields as it is associated with the permissible soil moisture limits so that crops do not suffer damage funding this research was funded by minciencias and the department of boyacá colombia

9934,the increasing use of antibiotics has become one of the main environmental and health problems today worldwide in addition to causing toxic effects on non targeted organisms their presence in the environment promotes the horizontal transfer of resistance genes thus increasing the presence of resistant bacteria in the environment and consequently the risk of super resistant bacterial infections in the present work we have investigated the occurrence of antibiotic resistant e coli and genes bla tem qnrs tetw suli and ermb in surface water samples from different agricultural irrigation ditches located around valencia city spain results of the research showed the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in all the analysed samples with mean percentages of 100 for tetw 96 for bla tem 80 for suli 72 for qnrs and ermb in 60 of samples the higher antibiotic resistance rates were detected in the samples whose waters had more contact with human or animal activities our study detected a high proportion 79 2 of multi resistant e coli isolates which presented a total of 26 multi resistance patterns the high levels of antibiotic resistances in irrigation waters observed in this work could help to both better understanding and management of the contamination caused by antibiotics and related resistance genes in agricultural environments in order to implement appropriate measures for control moreover appropriate surveillance of the quality of these waters as well as developing sanitation techniques are necessary to decrease antibiotic resistance rates in irrigation water in our geographical area graphical abstract ga1 keywords antibiotics resistance genes e coli irrigation ditches pcr 1 introduction fresh water is an essential resource for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes due to its high demand in agriculture the increase of the global population and changes in consumption patterns the availability and quality of fresh water are decreasing causing

reach fresh water from urbanisation agriculture wastewater treatment plants wwtps and pharmaceutical industry waste presence of antibiotics is the main factor for appearance and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in environment posing a very serious risk for human and environmental health the world health organisation who estimates that arb cause approximately 700 000 deaths per year worldwide who 2018 in spain according to the spanish ministry of health almost 3000 people die every year due to infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria pran 2019 antibiotic contamination is not only relevant because of the presence of resistant bacteria but also for the spreading of resistance genes martínez 2003 these genes can persist in the environment or in the bacterial population even after the disappearance of the selection pressure pruden et al 2006 hence they are considered environmental pollutants antibiotic resistance genes arg are easily transmissible between bacteria of the same or different species huerta et al 2013 due to selection pressure they can be found in genetically transmissible elements together with other antibiotic resistance genes or genes that confer resistance to other pollutants aminov and mackie 2007 the mechanism that allows for the spread of resistance genes is horizontal transfer what can happen between very different bacteria pathogenic or non pathogenic gram negative or gram positive pruden et al 2006 the conjunction of antibiotic residues stress environmental conditions and the presence of microplastics a new reactive surface for biofilm formation in aquatic ecosystems increases the horizontal gene transfer and consequently the presence of resistance genes in the environment arias andres et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 spread of these arg causes cross resistance among pathogenic bacteria and increases the emergence of super resistant microorganisms o neill 2015 wright 2005 this emergence of antibiotic resistances in microorganisms of clinical concern has led to investigate their presence in environment from where they can reach humans many authors have studied aquatic environments including wastewaters sea water surface rivers and lakes recreational or drinking water christou et al 2017 niu et al 2016 proia et al 2016 hatosy and martiny 2015 huerta et al 2013 stoll et al 2012 xi et al 2009 detecting numerous antibiotics diverse families of arg and arb belonging to different populations and communities this confirms the wide dispersion of resistances in different aquatic systems as well as the importance of the problem worldwide among european countries spain presents the highest concentrations of antibiotics in surface waters danner et al 2019 ginebreda et al 2010 according to martínez 2003 90 of the bacteria present in water are resistant to one antibiotic and 20 are resistant to at least five antibiotics being escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae some of the most relevant species who 2018 although a great number of recent investigations focus on the occurrence of antibiotics and arb in aquatic environments many gaps still remain larsson et al 2018 especially in those related to agriculture franklin et al 2016 williams nguyen et al 2016 not only human health but also the health of the agroecosystems may be in danger some studies have demonstrated that the presence of antibiotics in the environment affects the soil microbial communities altering some important microbial reactions as respiration iron reduction or nitrogen transformations franklin et al 2016 liu et al 2011 a consequence no less serious is the possibility of contamination of vegetables which can carry resistance genes as well as new strains of resistant pathogens to the food chain bürgmann et al 2018 hölzel et al 2018 arb can reach vegetables through irrigation water araújo et al 2017 gekenidis et al 2018 recently dungan and bjorneberg 2020 suggested that irrigation return flows can be a point source of args that ultimately discharge into surface waters animals waste can also contaminate wastewater or may be used as manure bringing antibiotics residues and resistant bacteria into crops grote et al 2007 in this way antibiotics can enter into human food chain through consumption of raw vegetables which can also carry antibiotic resistant food borne pathogenic bacteria araújo et al 2017 hölzel et al 2018 several studies have demonstrated a correlation between the presence of resistance genes in vegetables fruits soil and irrigation water cerqueira et al 2019a 2019b hölzel et al 2018 araújo et al 2017 jongman and korsten 2016 this is a main issue in the development of resistant bacterial strains which can infect humans increasing the difficulty to treat severe infections conde cid et al 2018 in this sense it is essential to develop studies that can help to explain the importance of natural water bodies in the spread of antibiotic resistance on agricultural environments and to clarify the implicated pathways the huerta valenciana is a historical region around the city of valencia spain that has a huge productive cultural and environmental value it is an important part of the local agricultural heritage irrigation is achieved by drawing water from the turia river to the surrounding fields via a complex network of irrigation ditches which have served effectively for the irrigation of this area for centuries vegetables from this area are consumed not only in this geographical area but all around the country thus the presence of antibiotics and arb in this water not only threatens the health of the environment but mainly human health in this work we aimed to study the existence of antibiotic resistance determinants bacteria

all these ditches network is used for crop irrigation reaching most of agricultural fields around the urban area of valencia carraixet ravine collects the drainage waters of the surrounding fields and the sampling point was located immediately before its outlet in the mediterranean sea all the sampling sites are open channels which receive occasional environmental contamination inputs from rainwater soil human and animal activity a total of 25 samples belonging to 5 sites and 5 different sampling times were analysed samples were collected in 2 l refrigerated sterile containers which were quickly transported within 2 h at 4 ºc to the laboratory and processed without further delay 2 2 water sample processing one hundred millilitres or if necessary decimal dilutions until 1 100 of each water sample were filtered through 0 45 µm pore diameter nitrocellulose membranes millipore which were aseptically transferred to microinstantr chromogenic coliform agar base scharlau barcelona a selective medium for e coli and coliforms bacteria in order to isolate presumptive arb the culture medium plates were was finally prepared adding one specific antibiotic to each one the antibiotics used were ampicillin oxytetracycline erythromycin sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin at 32 45 5 8 16 and 4 µg ml respectively the concentration of each antibiotic was from their minimal inhibitory concentration mic for enterobacteria plates of the same medium without antibiotic served as positive control and for determining total viable coliforms and e coli counts all analyses were made in quadruple after 24 h incubation at 37 c rose red coliforms and blue tentative e coli colonies on the plates with each type of antibiotic were counted one representative colony was selected from each antibiotic supplemented plate and each sampling site and time presumptive antibiotic resistant e coli were subcultured on the same medium and identified by api 20e system biomérieux españa e coli cultures were re suspended in te buffer tris 10 mm edta 1 mm ph 8 for further dna extraction cultures were also preserved at 80 c in microbanktm blue criovials pro lab diagnostics in addition 300 ml

and stored into 2 ml eppendorf tubes for subsequent dna extraction 2 3 antibiotic susceptibility testing of e coli isolates antibiotic resistance of e coli isolates was investigated by using the sensititre system thermo fisher according to the manufacturer s instructions this is an automatic system based on broth dilutions method which uses a multi well plate containing selected antimicrobials which is filled automatically with appropriate dilutions of the bacteria suspension after 24 h incubation growth is read by using a digital display system sensititre vizion thermo fisher and measured by vizion software swin thermo fisher the determination of the mic minimum inhibitory concentration corresponds to the lowest concentration with no growth results are interpreted according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing eucast http www eucast org e coli atcc 25922 was used as an internal control for all the assays sensititre euvsec plates were used for testing 125 e coli isolates susceptibility to fourteen antimicrobial compounds sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim ciprofloxacin tetracycline meropenem azithromycin nalidixic acid cefotaxime chloramphenicol tigecycline ceftazidime colistin ampicillin and gentamicin 2 4 antibiotic resistance gene detection prior to dna extraction 80 mg of glass beads sigma aldrich and 500 µl of t lysis

for about 60 min and visualized by uv transillumination a 100 bp dna ladder generuler 100 bp dna ladder thermo fisher was used as molecular weight marker 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed by using statgraphics centurion xvii a multi factor analysis of variance was carried out to compare the results obtained in e coli counts for each sample followed by a post hoc analysis using the fisher s least significance difference lsd method resistance genes detection was analysed by χ2 test using contingency tables in order to establish any possible dependence with location and or moment of sampling 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibiotic resistant faecal contamination in water samples all water samples presented presumptive antibiotic resistant faecal coliforms at levels that were impossible to quantify due to their elevated concentration even when decimal dilutions were performed this result was found in all the plates which contained antibiotics except for samples incubated with oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin which could be counted registering mean values from 1 28 to 1 96 logarithm of cfu 100 ml for ciprofloxacin and from 1 42 to 1 79 for oxytetracycline e coli counting was possible in most of the samples except for the vera irrigation ditch vid and some samples from rascanya irrigation ditch rid and the carraixet ravine cr whose waters were overly contaminated to allow colony counting table 2 no guidelines exist in europe for regulating quality of irrigation waters regarding antibiotic resistance bacteria however the presence of antibiotic resistant e coli has been proposed as an indicator of the presence of arb and associated clinically relevant genes gekenidis et al 2018 efsa 2008 the limit for irrigation surface waters advised by spanish guideline r d 1620 2007 is 100 e coli per 100 ml of water for water that comes into contact with edible products that will not be cooked prior to its consumption without any harvest time dependent guideline this value has been highly exceeded by e coli in all the tested samples the excessive concentration of e coli independently antibiotic resistant or not detected determines that the water could not be used for irrigation of raw eaten vegetables in any case therefore a surveillance of the quality of these waters as well as developing sanitation techniques are necessary aiming to avoid microbiological risks and decrease antibiotic resistance rates in irrigation water the presence of the antibiotic in the culture medium had a statistically significant effect on e coli growth compared with the control plates without antibiotic by sampling site table 2 overall counts were significantly lower in plates supplemented with ciprofloxacin 0 57 103 cfu 100 ml which showed the maximum inhibitory effect followed by oxytetracycline 2 05 103 cfu 100 ml and ampicillin 1 21 103 cfu 100 ml thus indicating that most e coli in these water sources are not resistant to these two antibiotics on the contrary erythromycin 3 49 103 cfu 100 ml was the less selective agent as occurred for total coliform counts statistical analysis multi factor analysis of variance showed that in addition to the presence of antibiotics in the media the sampling site and moment of sampling exerted a significant effect p 0 05 on presumptive resistant e coli counts mid and tr samples were the sites with the lowest concentration of bacteria showing no significant differences between them vid uncountable data rid and cr samples were the sites with significant highest e coli counts with mean values of 3 81 103 and 3 36 103 cfu 100 ml respectively vid and rid are irrigation ditches whose waters have crossed the city of valencia and the surrounding fields carrying with them bacteria from urban including hospitals wastewaters and manure fertilised soil furthermore they may also be contaminated by human or animal faecal material present in the vicinity of the irrigation channels the levels of e coli contamination were in the same order than those obtained in previous studies brooks et al 2014 udikovic kolic et al 2014 czekalski et al 2012 where the highest concentration of arb was found in surface or groundwater that have been subjected to contamination by sewage animal manure and agricultural activity the statistical study also showed that the moment of the sampling had a significant effect denoting that the highest e coli counts corresponded to the second sampling time 2 96 103 cfu 100 ml it is probably due to heavy rain in the days prior to this sampling which would have moved components from the agricultural soils as well as removed microorganisms from the sediment in the irrigation ditches several studies argue that sediments can act as a reservoir of bacteria zhang et al 2016 sidrach cardona et al 2014 de oliveira and pinhata 2008 alm et al 2003 providing nutrients and protection against light or predation 3 2 antibiotic susceptibility testing of e coli isolates a total of 125 e coli strains were isolated 25 from each sampling site corresponding to each one of the plates supplemented with the five antibiotics all isolates were subjected to automated antibiotic susceptibility test sensititre all of them showed resistance to at least one antibiotic resistance to sulfamethoxazole was the most frequent 96 8 of the isolates followed by ampicillin 72 tetracycline 64 8 and ciprofloxacin 60 table 3 antibiotics of more recent use like new generation cephalosporins cefotaxime and ceftazidime were less prevalent less used antibiotics such as meropenem tigecycline or colistin were found to be active against all the isolates overall a higher number of antibiotic resistant e coli isolates were detected in sulfamethoxazole supplemented media while the lower value corresponded to plates containing erythromycin fig 2 statistical analysis revealed that the addition of a specific antibiotic to the media did not significantly increase the number of e coli resistant to azithromycin chloramphenicol cefotaxime gentamicin and ceftazidime isolated from the plates however a significant influence of the presence of some antibiotics in the media was observed ampicillin resistance was favored in ampicillin ciprofloxacin oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole supplemented media resistances to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid were favored in ampicillin ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole supplemented media resistance to trimethoprim was favored by oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole presence in culture media finally sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline resistances were favored in all antibiotic supplemented media multiple resistance considered as resistance to 3 antibiotic classes egervärn et al 2017 was observed in 70 4 88 out of 125 e coli isolates a total of 15 multi resistance patterns were detected β lactam resistance was present in all resistance patterns followed by sulfonamide quinolone and tetracycline resistance 14 93 3 11 73 3 and 10 66 7 resistance patterns respectively the most frequent number of multi resistance among e coli isolates was against 4 and 5 antibiotic classes with 30 isolates each one followed by 3 with 16 isolates and 6 with 12 isolates table 4 in a similar work wang et al 2013 observed 31 different multi resistance patterns out of 114 e coli isolates from lake waters although a lower frequency of multi resistance has been detected in other studies carried out in rivers hu et al 2008 ram et al 2007 all of them showed a wide variety of multi resistance patterns which is usually attributed to the different origins of isolates osińska et al 2017 considering the sampling site carraixet ravine showed the highest rate of multi resistance 88 of their e coli isolates presenting four different phenotypes moreover three of these e coli isolates were resistant to 9 out of the 14 antibiotics tested this is a relevant result as carraixet ravine flows into the sea and it has been suggested that coastal waters can act as new reservoir for antibiotic resistance determinants contributing to the dissemination of antibiotic resistant microorganisms and genes bennani et al 2012 vera irrigation ditch showed a rate of 64 of multi resistance among its e coli isolates multi resistance is primarily associated with the proximity of hospitals czekalski et al 2012 in the present case an increase in resistance has been observed as the analysed water had made a longer path through the subsoil of the valencia city which raises the possibility of contact with other human activities such as hospitals or domestic wastewaters fig 3 the high multi resistance rate found in the river samples 80 does not disagree with the previous statement as these waters were collected in a recreational and shallow area and therefore it is expected that contact with humans and animals is high when statistical analysis was performed no significant difference among the site or the moment of sampling and percentage of multi resistant bacteria was observed this highlights the high frequency of resistances to antibiotics and the high level of dispersion through all the aquatic agricultural environments 3 3 antibiotic resistance genes detection aquatic ecosystems are some of the environments of most concern in arg research it must be taken into account that it is impossible to isolate and analyse all the cultured microorganisms which are present in a sample moreover some antibiotic resistant bacteria could be non culturable therefore by analysing only the isolates obtained after culturing the samples it is possible to lose relevant information culture independent methods allow for the detection of those arg carried by non culturable bacteria henriques et al 2006a 2006b for this reason in this work arg direct detection from water samples was also carried out it has been reported that sulfonamide tetracycline β lactams macrolide and to a lesser extent fluoroquinolones resistance genes are the most abundant arg in aquatic environments christou et al 2017 dang et al 2017 zhai et al 2016 thus a representative gene of each family was selected for this study arg detection was performed by pcr amplifying specific fragments of each one of the five tested genes the presence of these arg on the 125 e coli isolates was studied table 5 ninety six percent 120 of the isolates presented bla tem gene whereas ermb gene was only detected in one isolate 0 8 the rest of the genes presented a frequency no higher than 50 these results suggest that at least bla tem gene is largely widespread in aquatic environments from our geographical area with the aim of studying the existence of a significant correspondence between presence of a determined gene in a specific e coli isolate and the sampling site frequency data was further analysed by χ2 test no significant correlation was found between sampling site for bla tem ermb suli and tetw genes but for qnrs gene occurrence was significantly lower for e coli isolates from rid samples as mentioned above occurrence of genes was also studied directly in the water samples n 25 samples all five arg were detected in all locations although some variations in the frequency of detection could be observed between locations these were not significant tetw gene was detected in the totality of the water samples followed in frequency by bla tem gene 96 which was not detected in 20 of the rid samples suli gene 80 in total was less frequent in tr waters 60 whereas 100 of vid samples were positive for this gene for qnrs and ermb genes a major variability between samples was observed from 40 to 100 with a percentage average of 72 for qnrs and 60 for ermb fig 4 with the aim of studying a possible relationship between the same gene occurrence in water samples and in e coli isolates for each sample point a χ2 test was conducted significant differences p 0 05 were found for tetw and ermb genes for all sampling sites as well as for qnrs gene for rid vid and cr sites while 100 of water samples were positive for the tetw gene different levels of this gene were detected in e coli isolates from each point the presence of the qnrs gene was higher than 70 in water samples and below 25 in the e coli isolates with 0 in rid isolates for suli gene the lesser percentage detected in the isolates 48 8 compared to water samples 80 was not significant finally the gene that stands out is ermb being present in 60 of water samples and only in one e coli isolate 0 8 fig 4 the present study corroborates the hypothesis that cultivation dependent studies may underestimate the prevalence of resistance genes that are present in environmental samples henriques et al 2006a as the presence of arg detected directly in water samples was higher than in the isolates except for bla tem this may be due to several reasons args can be present in non culturable bacteria heritage et al 2001 naked dna can be present in the medium gaze et al 2013 nielsen et al 2007 or resistance may occur in bacteria from different families or genera than the ones usually analysed bengtsson palme et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 it must be considered also that in the present study only e coli isolates have been investigated efsa 2008 proposes to use e coli and other non pathogenic microorganisms as indicators of the occurrence of antibiotic resistances to the main antibiotics use in a given zone or country e coli has also been shown to be an important reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes which can transfer to pathogenic bacteria contributing this way to spread the resistances katakweba et al 2018 odonkor and addo 2018 therefore the search and detection of resistant e coli would constitute a good prediction for presence of clinically relevant resistant bacteria and associated genes gekenidis et al 2018 however the antibiotic resistance levels or the frequency of ar genes detected in e coli from a sample cannot be assumed to be the resistance levels in this same sample a high proportion of tetracycline β lactam and sulfonamide antibiotic resistance genes were detected in the present research these antibiotics are among the oldest and most widely used in human and animal medicine on account of their broad spectrum of activity and low cost ecdc 2015 harnisz et al 2011 results obtained here are in accordance with those reported by a variety of studies on surface waters rivers and lakes stoll et al 2012 reported suli as the most detected gene in superficial waters from germany and australia in other research carried out by henriques et al 2006a in estuary water from portugal around 80 of the enterobacteria isolates presented the bla tem gene and more than 50 carried tetracycline resistance genes in a pool of studies on rivers and lakes of china sulfonamide related genes were the most prevalent huang et al 2019 stange et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 regarding studies performed in spain ar bacteria and genes have been detected in rivers impacted by discharges of wastewater treatment plants rodríguez mozaz et al 2015 sidrach cardona et al 2014 martí et al 2013 demonstrating an incomplete removal of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance bacteria in the plants what affects severely the receiving river comparing sensititre and pcr results we can observe that the first method detected more frequency of resistances than what the presence of the selected genes in the strains could lead to expect this result is not surprising as there is a great variety of genes that encode for resistances to the same group of antibiotics beyond here selected likewise if a specific gene is not detected by pcr this does not imply the absence of resistance to a specific family of antibiotics in the isolates nevertheless bla tem gene was detected in 96 6 of 90 amp resistant e coli isolates in 100 of the 25 fot resistant and 21 taz resistant e coli isolates several studies have demonstrated that the most frequently detected gene was bla tem in amp resistant isolates from estuarine river and lake water henriques et al 2006a wang et al 2013 hu et al 2008 resistance to β lactam antibiotics is mediated mainly by β lactamases which are frequently detected in e coli and other gram negative bacteria these enzymes in addition to conferring resistance to ampicillin and penicillin are associated with resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins as shown herein by the high detection percentages in fot and taz resistant isolates moreover high percentages of bla tem gene were also detected in tet 98 8 smx 95 9 cip 94 6 nal 94 2 and tmp 93 8 resistant e coli the simultaneous occurrence of resistance to a variety of antibiotics is corroborated by the simultaneous presence of the genes that encode them in e coli isolates this could be explained by the presence of various genes in the same plasmid regarding the prevalence of the suli gene it was around 50 among isolates smx 60 of 121 and tmp resistant 34 of 65 e coli isolates a similar prevalence was found in smx resistant e coli isolated from rivers and lakes wang et al 2013 su et al 2012 hu et al 2008 a low frequency was detected for qnrs gene between quinolone resistant isolates 28 and 26 for cip and nal resistant isolates respectively wang et al 2013 reported a much lower frequency of qnrs regarding another quinolone resistant genes such as qnra or qnrb suggesting that cip and nal resistance among our e coli isolates is due to genes other than qnrs this great variability observed in the results of the present study highlights the complexity of the factors involved in the acquisition of resistance among bacterial isolates 4 conclusions environmental impact of fecal contamination as well as spread of antibiotic resistance genes has been extensively studied in wastewater destined for irrigation of agricultural soils but lesser in surface irrigation channels the ditches network in huerta valenciana is an ideal system to investigate the presence of arg and arb as a strong interaction exists with human ecosystem and their activities domestic agricultural and industrial thus this type of surface waters could be a dominant route by which args are disseminated in the present study we have evaluated the occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes in a network of irrigation ditches in the huerta valenciana valencia spain by studying both e coli isolates and water samples in order to relate antibiotic resistance levels to viable indicator bacteria present in the samples results of this study showed that all the water samples presented very high contamination levels of resistant fecal coliforms moreover a notable prevalence of multi resistant e coli strains 70 4 of the isolates was detected in the analyzed irrigation waters args for the main families of antibiotics sulfonamide tetracycline β lactams macrolide and fluoroquinolones were present in all irrigation waters the main prevalence rates corresponded to bla tem gene which was detected in 96 of the e coli isolates while the rest of genes presented frequencies no higher than 50 the use of these contaminated waters for irrigation increases the potential transfer of arb and arg to food crops thus vegetables irrigated with contaminated water can act as a potential vector for dissemination of antibiotic resistances among environment and human populations the high levels of antibiotic resistances in irrigation waters observed in this work could help to both better understanding and management of the contamination

9934,the increasing use of antibiotics has become one of the main environmental and health problems today worldwide in addition to causing toxic effects on non targeted organisms their presence in the environment promotes the horizontal transfer of resistance genes thus increasing the presence of resistant bacteria in the environment and consequently the risk of super resistant bacterial infections in the present work we have investigated the occurrence of antibiotic resistant e coli and genes bla tem qnrs tetw suli and ermb in surface water samples from different agricultural irrigation ditches located around valencia city spain results of the research showed the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in all the analysed samples with mean percentages of 100 for tetw 96 for bla tem 80 for suli 72 for qnrs and ermb in 60 of samples the higher antibiotic resistance rates were detected in the samples whose waters had more contact with human or animal activities our study detected a high proportion 79 2 of multi resistant e coli isolates which presented a total of 26 multi resistance patterns the high levels of antibiotic resistances in irrigation waters observed in this work could help to both better understanding and management of the contamination caused by antibiotics and related resistance genes in agricultural environments in order to implement appropriate measures for control moreover appropriate surveillance of the quality of these waters as well as developing sanitation techniques are necessary to decrease antibiotic resistance rates in irrigation water in our geographical area graphical abstract ga1 keywords antibiotics resistance genes e coli irrigation ditches pcr 1 introduction fresh water is an essential resource for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes due to its high demand in agriculture the increase of the global population and changes in consumption patterns the availability and quality of fresh water are decreasing causing problems in environmental sustainability and food security ercin and hoekstra 2014 antibiotics are some of the chemical pollutants most frequently found in the environment ternes et al 2004 they can reach fresh water from urbanisation agriculture wastewater treatment plants wwtps and pharmaceutical industry waste presence of antibiotics is the main factor for appearance and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb in environment posing a very serious risk for human and environmental health the world health organisation who estimates that arb cause approximately 700 000 deaths per year worldwide who 2018 in spain according to the spanish ministry of health almost 3000 people die every year due to infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria pran 2019 antibiotic contamination is not only relevant because of the presence of resistant bacteria but also for the spreading of resistance genes martínez 2003 these genes can persist in the environment or in the bacterial population even after the disappearance of the selection pressure pruden et al 2006 hence they are considered environmental pollutants antibiotic resistance genes arg are easily transmissible between bacteria of the same or different species huerta et al 2013 due to selection pressure they can be found in genetically transmissible elements together with other antibiotic resistance genes or genes that confer resistance to other pollutants aminov and mackie 2007 the mechanism that allows for the spread of resistance genes is horizontal transfer what can happen between very different bacteria pathogenic or non pathogenic gram negative or gram positive pruden et al 2006 the conjunction of antibiotic residues stress environmental conditions and the presence of microplastics a new reactive surface for biofilm formation in aquatic ecosystems increases the horizontal gene transfer and consequently the presence of resistance genes in the environment arias andres et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 spread of these arg causes cross resistance among pathogenic bacteria and increases the emergence of super resistant microorganisms o neill 2015 wright 2005 this emergence of antibiotic resistances in microorganisms of clinical concern has led to investigate their presence in environment from where they can reach humans many authors have studied aquatic environments including wastewaters sea water surface rivers and lakes recreational or drinking water christou et al 2017 niu et al 2016 proia et al 2016 hatosy and martiny 2015 huerta et al 2013 stoll et al 2012 xi et al 2009 detecting numerous antibiotics diverse families of arg and arb belonging to different populations and communities this confirms the wide dispersion of resistances in different aquatic systems as well as the importance of the problem worldwide among european countries spain presents the highest concentrations of antibiotics in surface waters danner et al 2019 ginebreda et al 2010 according to martínez 2003 90 of the bacteria present in water are resistant to one antibiotic and 20 are resistant to at least five antibiotics being escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and klebsiella pneumoniae some of the most relevant species who 2018 although a great number of recent investigations focus on the occurrence of antibiotics and arb in aquatic environments many gaps still remain larsson et al 2018 especially in those related to agriculture franklin et al 2016 williams nguyen et al 2016 not only human health but also the health of the agroecosystems may be in danger some studies have demonstrated that the presence of antibiotics in the environment affects the soil microbial communities altering some important microbial reactions as respiration iron reduction or nitrogen transformations franklin et al 2016 liu et al 2011 a consequence no less serious is the possibility of contamination of vegetables which can carry resistance genes as well as new strains of resistant pathogens to the food chain bürgmann et al 2018 hölzel et al 2018 arb can reach vegetables through irrigation water araújo et al 2017 gekenidis et al 2018 recently dungan and bjorneberg 2020 suggested that irrigation return flows can be a point source of args that ultimately discharge into surface waters animals waste can also contaminate wastewater or may be used as manure bringing antibiotics residues and resistant bacteria into crops grote et al 2007 in this way antibiotics can enter into human food chain through consumption of raw vegetables which can also carry antibiotic resistant food borne pathogenic bacteria araújo et al 2017 hölzel et al 2018 several studies have demonstrated a correlation between the presence of resistance genes in vegetables fruits soil and irrigation water cerqueira et al 2019a 2019b hölzel et al 2018 araújo et al 2017 jongman and korsten 2016 this is a main issue in the development of resistant bacterial strains which can infect humans increasing the difficulty to treat severe infections conde cid et al 2018 in this sense it is essential to develop studies that can help to explain the importance of natural water bodies in the spread of antibiotic resistance on agricultural environments and to clarify the implicated pathways the huerta valenciana is a historical region around the city of valencia spain that has a huge productive cultural and environmental value it is an important part of the local agricultural heritage irrigation is achieved by drawing water from the turia river to the surrounding fields via a complex network of irrigation ditches which have served effectively for the irrigation of this area for centuries vegetables from this area are consumed not only in this geographical area but all around the country thus the presence of antibiotics and arb in this water not only threatens the health of the environment but mainly human health in this work we aimed to study the existence of antibiotic resistance determinants bacteria and genes in the turia river and its irrigation ditches network 2 material and methods 2 1 water sample origin and collection five points were sampled monthly between january and may 2018 turia river

all these ditches network is used for crop irrigation reaching most of agricultural fields around the urban area of valencia carraixet ravine collects the drainage waters of the surrounding fields and the sampling point was located immediately before its outlet in the mediterranean sea all the sampling sites are open channels which receive occasional environmental contamination inputs from rainwater soil human and animal activity a total of 25 samples belonging to 5 sites and 5 different sampling times were analysed samples were collected in 2 l refrigerated sterile containers which were quickly transported within 2 h at 4 ºc to the laboratory and processed without further delay 2 2 water sample processing one hundred millilitres or if necessary decimal dilutions until 1 100 of

concentration mic for enterobacteria plates of the same medium without antibiotic served as positive control and for determining total viable coliforms and e coli counts all analyses were made in quadruple after 24 h incubation at 37 c rose red coliforms and blue tentative e coli colonies on the plates with each type of antibiotic were counted one representative colony was selected from each antibiotic supplemented plate and each sampling site and time presumptive antibiotic resistant e coli were subcultured on the same medium and identified by api 20e system biomérieux españa e coli

dna 1 5 mm mgcl2 0 2 mm each dntp 0 25 μm each primer 2 5 u of taq polymerase 2 5 µl of extracted dna and 1x pcr buffer reaching a final reaction volume of 25 µl all the pcr reagents were provided by ecogen barcelona spain positive dna with each resistance gene previously checked in our laboratory and negative controls milliq water were added the amplification was developed in a mastercycler pro eppendorf thermal cycler pcr products 10 µl were detected by electrophoresis on 1 3 w v agarose gel in tae 1x tris 40 mm acetic acid 20 mm edta 1 mm buffer with redsafetm intron biotechonolgy at 90 v for about 60 min and visualized by uv transillumination a 100 bp dna ladder generuler 100 bp dna ladder thermo fisher was used as molecular weight marker 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed by using statgraphics centurion xvii a multi factor analysis of variance was carried out to compare the results obtained in e coli counts for each sample followed by a post hoc analysis using the fisher s least significance difference lsd method resistance genes detection was analysed by χ2 test using contingency tables in order to establish any possible dependence with location and or moment of sampling 3 results and discussion 3 1 antibiotic resistant faecal contamination in water samples all water samples presented presumptive antibiotic resistant faecal coliforms at levels that were impossible to quantify due to their elevated concentration even when decimal dilutions were performed this result was found in all the plates which contained antibiotics except for samples incubated with oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin which could be counted registering mean values from 1 28 to 1 96 logarithm of cfu 100 ml for ciprofloxacin and from 1 42 to 1 79 for oxytetracycline e coli counting was possible in most of the samples except for the vera irrigation ditch vid and some samples from rascanya irrigation ditch rid and the carraixet ravine cr whose waters were overly contaminated to allow colony counting table 2 no guidelines exist in europe for regulating quality of irrigation waters regarding antibiotic resistance bacteria however the presence of antibiotic resistant e coli has been proposed as an indicator of the presence of arb and associated clinically relevant genes gekenidis et al 2018 efsa 2008 the limit for irrigation surface waters advised by spanish guideline r d 1620 2007 is 100 e coli per 100 ml of water for water that comes into contact with edible products that will not be cooked prior to its consumption without any harvest time dependent guideline this value has been highly exceeded by e coli in all the tested samples the excessive concentration of e coli independently antibiotic resistant or not detected determines that the water could not be used for irrigation of raw eaten vegetables in any case therefore a surveillance of the quality of these waters as well as developing sanitation techniques are necessary aiming to avoid microbiological risks and decrease antibiotic resistance rates in irrigation water the presence of the antibiotic in the culture medium had a statistically significant effect on e coli growth compared with the control plates without antibiotic by sampling site table 2 overall counts were significantly lower in plates supplemented with ciprofloxacin 0 57 103 cfu 100 ml which showed the maximum inhibitory effect followed by oxytetracycline 2 05 103 cfu 100 ml and ampicillin 1 21 103 cfu 100 ml thus indicating that most e coli in these water sources are not resistant to these two antibiotics on the contrary erythromycin 3 49 103 cfu 100 ml was the less selective agent as occurred for total coliform counts statistical analysis multi factor analysis of variance showed that in addition to the presence of antibiotics in the media the sampling site and moment of sampling exerted a significant effect p 0 05 on presumptive resistant e coli counts mid and tr samples were the sites with the lowest concentration of bacteria showing no significant differences between them vid uncountable data rid and cr samples were the sites with significant highest e coli counts with mean values of 3 81 103 and 3 36 103 cfu 100 ml respectively vid and rid are irrigation ditches whose waters have crossed the city of valencia and the surrounding fields carrying with them bacteria from urban including hospitals wastewaters and manure fertilised soil furthermore they may also be contaminated by human or animal faecal material present in the vicinity of the irrigation channels the levels of e coli contamination were in the same order than those obtained in previous studies brooks et al 2014 udikovic kolic et al 2014 czekalski et al 2012 where the highest concentration of arb was found in surface or groundwater that have been subjected to contamination by sewage animal manure and agricultural activity the statistical study also showed that the moment of the sampling had a significant effect denoting that the highest e coli counts corresponded to the second sampling time 2 96 103 cfu 100 ml it is probably due to heavy rain in the days prior to this sampling which would have moved components from the agricultural soils as well as removed microorganisms from the sediment in the irrigation ditches several studies argue that sediments can act as a reservoir of bacteria zhang et al 2016 sidrach cardona et al 2014 de oliveira and pinhata 2008 alm et al 2003 providing nutrients and protection against light or predation 3 2 antibiotic susceptibility testing of e coli isolates a total of 125 e coli strains were isolated 25 from each sampling site corresponding to each one of the plates supplemented with the five antibiotics all isolates were subjected to automated antibiotic susceptibility test sensititre all of them showed resistance to at least one antibiotic resistance to sulfamethoxazole was the most frequent 96 8 of the isolates followed by ampicillin 72 tetracycline 64 8 and ciprofloxacin 60 table 3 antibiotics of more recent use like new generation cephalosporins cefotaxime and ceftazidime were less prevalent less used antibiotics such as meropenem tigecycline or colistin were found to be active against all the isolates overall a higher number of antibiotic resistant e coli isolates were detected in sulfamethoxazole supplemented media while the lower value corresponded to plates containing erythromycin fig 2 statistical analysis revealed that the addition of a specific antibiotic to the media did not significantly increase the number of e coli resistant to azithromycin chloramphenicol cefotaxime gentamicin and ceftazidime isolated from the plates however a significant influence of the presence of some antibiotics in the media was observed ampicillin resistance was favored in ampicillin ciprofloxacin oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole supplemented media resistances to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid were favored in ampicillin ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole supplemented media resistance to trimethoprim was favored by oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole presence in culture media finally sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline resistances were favored in all antibiotic supplemented media multiple resistance considered as resistance to 3 antibiotic classes egervärn et al 2017 was observed in 70 4 88 out of 125 e coli isolates a total of 15 multi resistance patterns were detected β lactam resistance was present in all resistance patterns followed by sulfonamide quinolone and tetracycline resistance 14 93 3 11 73 3 and 10 66 7 resistance patterns respectively the most frequent number of multi resistance among e coli isolates was against 4 and 5 antibiotic classes with 30 isolates each one followed by 3 with 16 isolates and 6 with 12 isolates table 4 in a similar work wang et al 2013 observed 31 different multi resistance patterns out of 114 e coli isolates from lake waters although a lower frequency of multi resistance has been detected in other studies carried out in rivers hu et al 2008 ram et al 2007 all of them showed a wide variety of multi resistance patterns which is usually attributed to the different origins of isolates osińska et al 2017 considering the sampling site carraixet ravine showed the highest rate of multi resistance 88 of their e coli isolates presenting four different phenotypes moreover three of these e coli isolates were resistant to 9 out of the 14 antibiotics tested this is a relevant result as carraixet ravine flows into the sea and it has been suggested that coastal waters can act as new reservoir for antibiotic resistance determinants contributing to the dissemination of antibiotic resistant microorganisms and genes bennani et al 2012 vera irrigation ditch showed a rate of 64 of multi resistance among its e coli isolates multi resistance is primarily associated with the proximity of hospitals czekalski et al 2012 in the present case an increase in resistance has been observed as the analysed water had made a longer path through the subsoil of the valencia city which raises the possibility of contact with other human activities such as hospitals or domestic wastewaters fig 3 the high multi resistance rate found in the river samples 80 does not disagree with the previous statement as these waters were collected in a recreational and shallow area and therefore it is expected that contact with humans and animals is high when statistical analysis was performed no significant difference among the site or the moment of sampling and percentage of multi resistant bacteria was observed this highlights the high frequency of resistances to antibiotics and the high level of dispersion through all the aquatic agricultural environments 3 3 antibiotic resistance genes detection aquatic ecosystems are some of the environments of most concern in arg research it must be taken into account that it is impossible to isolate and analyse all the cultured microorganisms which are present in a sample moreover some antibiotic resistant bacteria could be non culturable therefore by analysing only the isolates obtained after culturing the samples it is possible to lose relevant information culture independent methods allow for the detection of those arg carried by non culturable bacteria henriques et al 2006a 2006b for this reason in this work arg direct detection from water samples was also carried out it has been reported that sulfonamide tetracycline β lactams macrolide and to a lesser extent fluoroquinolones resistance genes are the most abundant arg in aquatic environments christou et al 2017 dang et al 2017 zhai et al 2016 thus a representative gene of each family was selected for this study arg detection was performed by pcr amplifying specific fragments of each one of the five tested genes the presence of these arg on the 125 e coli isolates was studied table 5 ninety six percent 120 of the isolates presented bla tem gene whereas ermb gene was only detected in one isolate 0 8 the rest of the genes presented a frequency no higher than 50 these results suggest that at least bla tem gene is largely widespread in aquatic environments from our geographical area with the aim of studying the existence of a significant correspondence between presence of a determined gene in a specific e coli isolate and the sampling site frequency data was further analysed by χ2 test no significant correlation was found between sampling site for bla tem ermb suli and tetw genes but for qnrs gene occurrence was significantly lower for e coli isolates from rid samples as mentioned above occurrence of genes was also studied directly in the water samples n 25 samples all five arg were detected in all locations although some variations in the frequency of detection could be observed between locations these were not significant tetw gene was detected in the totality of the water samples followed in frequency by bla tem gene 96 which was not detected in 20 of the rid samples suli gene 80 in total was less frequent in tr waters 60 whereas 100 of vid samples were positive for this gene for qnrs and ermb genes a major variability between samples was observed from 40 to 100 with a percentage average of 72 for qnrs and 60 for ermb fig 4 with the aim of studying a possible relationship between the same gene occurrence in water samples and in e coli isolates for each sample point a χ2 test was conducted significant differences p 0 05 were found for tetw and ermb genes for all sampling sites as well as for qnrs gene for rid vid and cr sites while 100 of water samples were positive for the tetw gene different levels of this gene were detected in e coli isolates from each point the presence of the qnrs gene was higher than 70 in water samples and below 25 in the e coli isolates with 0 in rid isolates for suli gene the lesser percentage detected in the isolates 48 8 compared to water samples 80 was not significant finally the gene that stands out is ermb being present in 60 of water samples and only in one e coli isolate 0 8 fig 4 the present study corroborates the hypothesis that cultivation dependent studies may underestimate the prevalence of resistance genes that are present in environmental samples henriques et al 2006a as the presence of arg detected directly in water samples was higher than in the isolates except for bla tem this may be due to several reasons args can be present in non culturable bacteria heritage et al 2001 naked dna can be present in the medium gaze et al 2013 nielsen et al 2007 or resistance may occur in bacteria from different families or genera than the ones usually analysed bengtsson palme et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 it must be considered also that in the present study only e coli isolates have been investigated efsa 2008 proposes to use e coli and other non pathogenic microorganisms as indicators of the occurrence of antibiotic resistances to the main antibiotics use in a given zone or country e coli has also been shown to be an important reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes which can transfer to pathogenic bacteria contributing this way to spread the resistances katakweba et al 2018 odonkor and addo 2018 therefore the search and detection of resistant e coli would constitute a good prediction for presence of clinically relevant resistant bacteria and associated genes gekenidis et al 2018 however the antibiotic resistance levels or the frequency of ar genes detected in e coli from a sample cannot be assumed to be the resistance levels in this same sample a high proportion of tetracycline β lactam and sulfonamide antibiotic resistance genes were detected in the present research these antibiotics are among the oldest and most widely used in human and animal medicine on account of their broad spectrum of activity and low cost ecdc 2015 harnisz et al 2011 results obtained here are in accordance with those reported by a variety of studies on surface waters rivers and lakes stoll et al 2012 reported suli as the most detected gene in superficial waters from germany and australia in other research carried out by henriques et al 2006a in estuary water from portugal around 80 of the enterobacteria isolates presented the bla tem gene and more than 50 carried tetracycline resistance genes in a pool of studies on rivers and lakes of china sulfonamide related genes were the most prevalent huang et al 2019 stange et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 regarding studies performed in spain ar bacteria and genes have been detected in rivers impacted by discharges of wastewater treatment plants rodríguez mozaz et al 2015 sidrach cardona et al 2014 martí et al 2013 demonstrating an incomplete removal of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance bacteria in the plants what affects severely the receiving river comparing sensititre and pcr results we can observe that the first method detected more frequency of resistances than what the presence of the selected genes in the strains could lead to expect this result is not surprising as there is a great variety of genes that encode for resistances to the same group of antibiotics beyond here selected likewise if a specific gene is not detected by pcr this does not imply the absence of resistance to a specific family of antibiotics in the isolates nevertheless bla tem gene was detected in 96 6 of 90 amp resistant e coli isolates in 100 of the 25 fot resistant and 21 taz resistant e coli isolates several studies have demonstrated that the most frequently detected gene was bla tem in amp resistant isolates from estuarine river and lake water henriques et al 2006a wang et al 2013 hu et al 2008 resistance to β lactam antibiotics is mediated mainly by β lactamases which are frequently detected in e coli and other gram negative bacteria these enzymes in addition to conferring resistance to ampicillin and penicillin are associated with resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins as shown herein by the high detection percentages in fot and taz resistant isolates moreover high percentages of bla tem gene were also detected in tet 98 8 smx 95 9 cip 94 6 nal 94 2 and tmp 93 8 resistant e coli the simultaneous occurrence of resistance to a variety of antibiotics is corroborated by the simultaneous presence of the genes that encode them in e coli isolates this could be explained by the presence of various genes in the same plasmid regarding the prevalence of the suli gene it was around 50 among isolates smx 60 of 121 and tmp resistant 34 of 65 e coli isolates a similar prevalence was found in smx resistant e coli isolated from rivers and lakes wang et al 2013 su et al 2012 hu et al 2008 a low frequency was detected for qnrs gene between quinolone resistant isolates 28 and 26 for cip and nal resistant isolates respectively wang et al 2013 reported a much lower frequency of qnrs regarding another quinolone resistant genes such as qnra or qnrb suggesting that cip and nal resistance among our e coli isolates is due to genes other than qnrs this great variability observed in the results of the present study highlights the complexity of the factors involved in the acquisition of resistance among bacterial isolates 4 conclusions environmental impact of fecal contamination as well as spread of antibiotic resistance genes has been extensively studied in wastewater destined for irrigation of agricultural soils but lesser in surface irrigation channels the ditches network in huerta valenciana is an ideal system to investigate the presence of arg and arb as a strong interaction exists with human ecosystem and their activities domestic agricultural and industrial thus this type of surface waters could be a dominant route by which args are disseminated in the present study we have evaluated the occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes in a network of irrigation ditches in the huerta valenciana valencia spain by studying both e coli isolates and water samples in order to relate antibiotic resistance levels to viable indicator bacteria present in the samples results of this study showed that all the water samples presented very high contamination levels of resistant fecal coliforms moreover a notable prevalence of multi resistant e coli strains 70 4 of the isolates was detected in the analyzed irrigation waters args for the main families of antibiotics sulfonamide tetracycline β lactams macrolide and fluoroquinolones were present in all irrigation waters the main prevalence rates corresponded to bla tem gene which was detected in 96 of the e coli isolates while the rest of genes presented frequencies no higher than 50 the use of these contaminated waters for irrigation increases the potential transfer of arb and arg to food crops thus vegetables irrigated with contaminated water can act as a potential vector for dissemination of antibiotic resistances among environment and human populations the high levels of antibiotic resistances in irrigation waters observed in this work could help to both better understanding and management of the contamination
