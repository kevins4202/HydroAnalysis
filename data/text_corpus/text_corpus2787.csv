activated by argon plasma and immediately grafted with acrylic acid such composite membranes were first characterized by x ray diffractometry xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and water contact angle measurements these composite membranes were then applied to remove phenol and m nitrophenol in the single and binary systems under

of electron hole pairs in contrast to traditional suspended catalyst systems the as prepared composite membranes were proven to be more economic and efficient materials for the removal of organic pollutants finally the intermediates produced during uv photocatalysis of single and binary phenol m nitrophenol using the composite membranes were detected and identified by uplc qtof ms and the degradation pathways were proposed accordingly keywords titania graphene oxide poly vinylidene fluoride membrane photocatalysis phenolic compounds 1 introduction many methods have been often applied to treat organic pollutants including phenolic compounds for example adsorption with multiple absorbents such as iron oxide activated carbon zeolite resins etc 1 2 electrochemical oxidation heterogeneous photocatalysis and oxidation with chemical oxidants 3 among the aforementioned methods photocatalysis using tio2 has been received much consideration due to the high chemical stability and cost effectiveness of tio2 be very stable and active under uv light tio2 could be used in many types of water samples 4 in principle when tio2 particles are irradiated by uv light with an energy greater than or equal to the bandgap electrons from the valence band are excited and transferred to the conduction band leaving holes h eq 1 holes then can react with water molecules absorbed on the surface of tio2 releasing hydroxyl radicals o h eq 2 the electrons react with the dissolved oxygen molecules to form super oxygen radicals o2 eq 3 then h oh and o 2 can decompose organic pollutants to the products eq 4 1 t i o 2 h ν h e 2 h h 2 o o h h 3 e o 2 o 2 4 h o h o 2 p o l l u tan t s int e r m e d i a t e s f i n a l p r o d u c t s to enhance photocatalytic performance of tio2 some efforts have tried to support tio2 nanoparticles on support or carrier this is because the agglomeration of tio2 suspensions that causes a large decrease in surface area should be avoided in some cases the powder type support such as graphene oxide go or reduced graphene oxide rgo can play as an electron reservoir and transporter of electrons photo generated during tio2 excitation 5 7 the mentioned charge carriers are freely transferred through graphene sheets decreasing the recombination rate of electron hole pairs thus enhancing photocatalytic performance of tio2 graphene systems besides the negatively charged and high surface area of graphene sheets benefits the enhancement of the adsorption rate of organics in water especially cationic dyes like methylene blue however an additional method such as filtration is still required to recover all nanoparticles from the solution for reuse when tio2 or tio2 go suspensions are applied this will make photocatalysis rather costly and time consuming for practical applications to meet the requirements of reducing agglomeration and easy recovery a microporous polymer membrane support was adopted to immobilize tio2 nanoparticles or tio2 go nanohybrids in this study 8 a literature survey indicates that two main types of such composite membranes have been prepared for effective antifouling via self cleaning effect 9 11 and for enhanced photocatalysis 12 18 in the former case for example laohaprapanon et al 9 studied the coating of zno on poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane to reduce fouling through photooxidation process zno particles were synthesized by co precipitation of zinc acetate with oxalic acid at 60 c results showed that the membrane hydrophilicity is largely improved by the self assembly of zno and the water flux is enhanced the zno coated membrane severely fouled after the filtration of alginate 1 wt can fully recover its original flux under uv irradiation for 30 min in the latter case for instance fischer et al 12 have synthesized tio2 particles at the surface of polyethersulfone pes and pvdf membranes via hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide as a result a non aggregated and strongly bonded layer of tio2 particles was built on the membrane surface the pvdf membranes with crystallized tio2 showed satisfactory photodegradation of methylene blue dye and drugs under uv irradiation at a density of 7 6 mw cm2 however the photodegradation kinetics of dye and drugs were not analyzed quantitatively in their research in this study a mixture of tio2 and go materials was coated and immobilized on the surface of a microporous hydrophobic pvdf membrane after the membrane was activated by argon plasma and then grafted by acrylic acid such composite membranes were commonly called as photocatalytic membranes pvdf membrane was chosen due to its strong mechanical property thermal stability and chemical resistance 9 11 12 the plasma grafting fabrication was not only rapid and facial but also easy to tune the surface of the membrane such that its supporting ability for both tio2 and go was increased the surface morphology and physicochemical properties of the prepared photocatalytic membranes were first studied the photocatalytic ability of the composite membranes was then evaluated through the degradation of organic pollutants two phenolic compounds including phenol and m nitrophenol were selected as model pollutants here partly because they are considered as priority pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency 1 3 moreover uv light photocatalysis was widely used to treat phenolic compounds previously particularly phenol over suspended tio2 particles 19 26 which enables us to evaluate the performance of this study the intermediates formed during uv photocatalysis of single and binary phenol m nitrophenol using as prepared photocatalytic membranes were also detected and identified by a high resolution liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uplc qtof ms waters the degradation pathways were proposed and discussed accordingly 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials titanium dioxide

thermal scientific co to prepare tio2 based photoanodes for photocurrent measurements we immersed indium doped tin oxide glass ito with an area of 5 5 cm2 in pvdf tio2 and pvdf tgo 50 slurries separately at room temperature for 2 h which were designated to tio2 and tgo 50 photoanodes respectively after the immersion coating the prepared photoanodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 c overnight the photocurrent measurement was carried out in a three electrode configuration system chi 608 using 200 ml distilled water ph 6 8 as the electrolyte solution herein pt wire and ag agcl served as the counter and the reference electrodes respectively an uv c lamp 100 w was turned on and off successively for generating and powering off the photocurrent response from both photoanodes the chronoamperometry tests were conducted in a zennium electrochemical workstations zahner elektrik gmbh co germany at a constant potential of 0 3 v vs ag agcl for a period of 50 s 2 5 photodegradation experiments photodegradation experiments were carried out in a photoreactor equipped with a uv c lamp 100 w hl 100ch 5 sen lights co osaka japan as shown in fig 1 the uv lamp intensity was 6 5 0 1 mw cm2 which was regularly checked by a uv radiometer uv mo03a orc manufacturing co tokyo japan the lamp was put in a doubled wall quartz tube which was connected to a cooling system for maintaining the temperature of the reactor at 25 c briefly 800 ml of the solution containing phenol m nitrophenol or their mixture was prepared and poured into the reactor one piece of the photocatalytic membrane was attached to the inner surface of the reactor and fully immersed in the solution the solution was magnetically stirred at the speed of 50 rpm and the ph of the solution was adjusted by 0 1 m of hcl or naoh solution at pre set time intervals 1 ml of the solution was taken out and the remaining concentration of phenolic compound was determined by hplc in some cases the intermediates produced during photocatalysis were detected and identified by lc qtof ms analysis the photodegradation efficiency of the present process was expressed by its removal calculated by eq 5 5 r e m o v a l 100 c 0 c t c 0 where c 0 and c t are the concentrations of phenolic compound at the beginning and at time t respectively mm 2 6 analytical methods the concentrations of phenol and m nitrophenol in single and binary systems were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc jasco japan equipped with a c18 reversed phase column model 00g 3172 e0 particle size 5 μm the temperature of the column was maintained at 35 c the conditions for the determination of phenol and m nitrophenol were shown in table 1 the transformation products formed during photocatalysis of phenol and or m nitrophenol were detected and identified by qtof ms waters xevo g2 xs equipped with an acquity uplc i class system milford ma usa a waters acquity beh c18 column 2 1 50 mm 1 7 μm

min then back to the initial condition of 5 solution b the mass spectrometry was detected by electrospray ionization in a negative mode esi 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of tio2 go composite membrane multiple measurements were applied to confirm the successful synthesis of as prepared materials fig 2 a shows the xrd patterns of graphite go and tio2 the disappearance of a sharp diffraction peak at 2θ 26 and the appearance of two new peaks at 2θ around 11 and 43 which are the characteristic peaks of go 28 indicating the complete oxidation of graphite to go this is also confirmed by raman spectra fig 3 with a clear appearance of the d band generated at 1353 cm 1 due to the out of plane vibration of the structural defect caused by oxygen containing groups of go fig 2b illustrates the xrd patterns of pristine pvdf membrane the membranes after plasma activation only plasma treated pvdf after grafting by acrylic acid only pvdf g aa and after final coating with tgo 50 pvdf g aa tgo 50 in comparison with the pristine membrane the plasma treated pvdf and pvdf g aa membranes remain the natural structure of pvdf this indicates that plasma activation and the subsequent grafting process have no impact on the crystal structure of pvdf 29 from the xrd patterns of pvdf g aa tgo 50 the diffraction peak at 2θ 25 3 corresponds to the reflection of the anatase phase of tio2 particles the absence of the diffraction peaks of go and tio2 is probably due to homogeneous dispersion of go on the surface of tio2 particles instead of stacking together 30 fig 4 shows the ftir spectra of pristine and plasma treated pvdf membranes as well as pvdf g aa and pvdf g aa tgo 50 composite membranes the ftir spectra of pvdf membrane present the vibration bands at 496 843 and 880 cm 1 indicating the β phase of pvdf whereas the peaks in the range from 1060 to 1254 cm 1 are ascribed to cf2 vibration 31 for the pvdf g aa membrane the appearance of an absorption band at 1728 cm 1 corresponding to co stretching vibration results from the grafting of aa onto pvdf 32 in ftir spectra of pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane the band at 1390 cm 1 that is very close to the peak 1410 cm 1 ch2 vibration of pvdf is attributed to co stretching vibration of the functional groups in go 33 it was reported that the vibration of ti o appears in the range of 400 1000 cm 1 31 33 however it is not so apparent in the ftir spectra of the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane this is likely due to a low amount of tio2 go coated on the membrane surface although the xrd patterns and increased peak intensity in the range of 400 1000 cm 1 indicate the contribution of tio2 in the composite membrane fig 5 a shows the surface morphology of the pristine pvdf membrane resembling a spider web of connected nano spherical particles this structure was almost unchanged after plasma treatment fig 5b after grafting with aa some pores in the pvdf membrane were blocked however this only happened on the surface of the pvdf membrane fig 5f this well agrees with the results reported in clochard et al 34 which indicated that aa is not possible to reach the inner part of the pvdf membrane the distribution of tio2 and go on the surface of the membranes with different tio2 loadings is shown in fig 5d h it is seen that tio2 was dispersed on the sheet like go surface for the membranes with 25 wt and 50 wt tio2 fig 5d e when the weight percent of tio2 is larger than 75 the agglomeration happens to form clusters of tio2 particles the serious agglomeration behavior of tio2 particles occurs in the absence of go fig 5h the wettability of pristine and modified pvdf membranes was studied via contact angle measurements as shown in fig 6 the water contact angle of the raw pvdf membrane was 116 8 3 9 and decreased to 65 1 0 9 after plasma treatment this is because the membrane surface becomes rougher or the surface pores are widened after plasma treatment 35 after grafting with aa some hydroxyl groups may be formed on the surface of the pvdf membrane 36 leading to the water contact angle down to 49 1 1 6 the hydrophilicity was further increased after the grafted membrane was coated with tio2 go this is due to the contribution of oxygenated hydrophilic groups in go 37 the hydrophilic improvement of the membranes demonstrates an increased water flux or permeability which promises to further their application in water wastewater treatment fig 7 a shows the chronoamperometry curves of both photoanodes in aqueous electrolyte when successively and suddenly switching white light on and off both potentiostatic currents are found to decrease rapidly in the initial stage whereas they remain stable after 20 s the steady state polarization curves reveal that the stable current of tgo 50 photoanode is approximately 7 6 times higher than that of tio2 photoanode this result indicates that tgo 50 electrode exhibits superior photocatalytic activity and excellent stability than the pristine one the process of electron hole recombination can be expressed by the following kinetic equation 38 39 6 d i t i f i i i f exp t τ where d is a dimensionless factor related to the variation of current change with time t τ is a parameter defined as the transient time constant i is the photoanode current and the subscripts i and f signify the initial and final steady state as shown in fig 7 a the initial increase in the photocurrent is followed by an exponential decrease with time this initial maximum anodic spike is attributed to the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs at the semiconductor electrolyte interface 39 40 the photocurrent decay reveals that recombination processes are occurring holes reaching the semiconductor surface may instead of capturing electrons from the electrolyte accumulate at the surface and recombine with electrons from the conduction band therefore the photocurrent decay is determined by the rate at which the minority carriers trapped at the surface states capture the majority carriers the transient time constant is related to the relaxation time i e the period needed for the concentration of photocarriers within the film to reach a constant level 38 40 fig 7 b depicts two linear correlations of ln d versus t for both photoanodes where the τ values can be determined from the slope of the linear plots the excellent correlation coefficients for tio2 r 2 0 980 and tgo 50 r 2 0 997 photoanodes reflects satisfactory linearity the τ value of tgo 50 electrode reaches as high as 2 43 s which is 1 53 times longer than that of tio2 electrode 1 59 s the short relaxation time is likely associated with a higher number of recombination centers in the crystalline tio2 electrode this improved τ value of tgo 50 electrode is ascribed to the presence of go sheets offering a stereo conductive framework that effectively alleviates the electron hole recombination rate this mainly originates from the unique architecture where the go sheets embedded in the tio2 photoanode provide well developed network for electron conduction reducing the possibility for electron hole recombination 3 2 photodegradation experiments 3 2 1 effect of tio2 loading as shown in the fe sem images go in the composite membrane is present as sheets for anchored tio2 and the weight ratio of tio2 to go can affect the dispersion of tio2 on the membrane surface to find the optimal ratio four composite membranes with 25 wt 50 wt 75 wt and 100 wt of tio2 in tio2 go were used for the removal of phenol and m nitrophenol as shown in fig 8 a b both phenol and m nitrophenol were hard to be degraded under uv photolysis only under the conditions studied phenolic compounds were effectively degraded in the presence of composite membranes for instance the removal of phenol and m nitrophenol was 70 and 44 within 3 h using the pvdf g aa tgo 25 membrane respectively they were increased to 78 and 54 in the case of the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane it is expected that more active radicals will be generated to attack organic compounds when tio2 loading is increased however the removal of phenol and m nitrophenol decreased to 74 and 48 respectively for further addition of tio2 up to 75 wt at a high tio2 loading the agglomeration of tio2 particles happened leading to a decrease in specific surface area thereby the generation of radicals as well as the interaction between pollutants and radicals on the catalyst surface decreased this behavior was observed using the membrane with 100 tio2 where the removal of phenol and m nitrophenol was 61 and 28 respectively here go sheets can not only support tio2 particles by physisorption electrostatic binding or charged transfer interaction 7 but also reduce their agglomeration an optimal tio2 loading of 50 wt in the tio2 go mixture was chosen in this study the photodegradation of binary phenol 0 53 mm and m nitrophenol 0 18 mm using different composite membranes was studied and shown in fig 8c d the trend of removal efficiency with increasing tio2 loading was similar to the single systems both phenol and m nitrophenol showed the best removal using the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane however in comparison with the single system the removal of both pollutants was decreased particularly the removal of phenol decreased from 78 to 65 but from 54 to 22 for m nitrophenol the more significant decrease in m nitrophenol removal 32 can be explained by the ability of the interaction between two organics and the composite membrane according to catherine et al 41 oh containing compounds such as phenolics can form hydrogen bond with oxygen functional groups in go however no2 in m nitrophenol has electrophilic property 42 leading to the difficulty to form a hydrogen bond therefore phenol molecules easily interact with the composite membrane than m nitrophenol this also reflects the slower removal of m nitrophenol in both single and binary systems compared to phenol in which the adsorption was not prominent the langmuir hinshelwood l h model is commonly applied to describe the kinetics of heterogeneous catalysis the l h model basically relates the degradation rate r mm min to the surface coverage of the organics on the catalyst θs as follows 7 r d c t d t k θ s k k l c t 1 k l c t where k is the intrinsic rate constant mm min k l is the langmuir adsorption constant mm 1 and c t is the reactant concentration at time t mm the l h model can be simplified to the pseudo first order kinetic equation when the solution is comparatively diluted as also stated previously 19 43 eq 7 then becomes eq 8 8 r d c t d t k a p p c t where k app is the apparent first order rate constant min 1 by integrating eq 8 we have 9 ln c t c 0 k a p p t as shown in fig 9 the logarithm graphs based on eq 9 cannot show a linear relationship in the entire reaction time alternatively we can obtain two good linear regressions following the pseudo first order kinetics with the apparent rate constant k 1 and k 2 respectively one possible reason for leading to such transition around 60 min is the threshold coverage of composite membrane surface due to the adsorption of reaction intermediates 20 this means that the surface of the composite membrane is not yet occupied by the intermediates in the initial stage after that period the intermediates start to occupy the membrane surface sites thereby decreasing the degradation rate of the pollutant as shown in table 2 the removal of phenol in the first 60 min was more quickly than that of m nitrophenol after that time the rate was insignificantly different from similar k 2 values 3 2 2 effect of solution ph it is accepted that solution ph is one of the important factors because it can cause a change not only in surface charge of the catalyst but also in the ionization degree of the pollutants leading to a change in the interaction between them 44 fig 10a b show the effect of solution ph on the degradation of single phenol and m nitrophenol using the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane the removal of phenol and m nitrophenol was low in strongly acidic and alkaline media in particular 66 and 42 of phenol were degraded at ph 4 and 10 respectively within 3 h while 18 and 27 of m nitrophenol were removed respectively the pk a value of phenol and m nitrophenol is reported to be 9 9 and 8 4 respectively 45 46 the phenolic compound is present in neutral forms when the solution ph is less than pk a and becomes negatively charged as phenolate when the solution ph is larger than pka moreover the zero point of charge for tio2 was reported to be around 6 0 47 this explains the low removal in a strongly alkaline medium because the material and phenol are both negatively charged leading to electrostatic repulsion the high removal of phenol and m nitrophenol at their natural ph which is 6 68 and 5 41 respectively again indicates that the prominent interaction between the organics and material is hydrogen bonding and π π interaction rather than electrostatic interaction while phenol presents better removal in neutral and weakly acidic media but poorer removal in an alkaline medium in a binary system it is found that the trends for m nitrophenol are different fig 10c the best removal of m nitrophenol occurs in an alkaline medium ph 10 this could be explained by the ability to form a hydrogen bond of m nitrophenol in an alkaline medium under this condition the negative charge on the surface of tio2 formed by oh acts as a ligand on ti iv 48 that is m nitrophenol will change to phenolate with a more negative charge at the nitrogen group therefore the hydrogen bonding became stronger between the nitrogen group and oh on the surface of tio2 besides the electrostatic repulsion of phenol and tio2 led to more chance than the interaction of m nitrophenol with the material resulting in better degradation of m nitrophenol under alkaline conditions table 3 compiles the apparent first order degradation rate constants k app obtained in this work and reported earlier using suspended catalysts although the literature results obtained under comparable conditions solution ph catalyst dose power intensity etc to the present study are unavailable the prepared composite membranes are proven to be more efficient and economic photocatalysts according to the k app values for phenol considering the comparatively small dose of the catalysts used in this work 3 3 degradation pathways the transformation products released during uv photocatalysis were identified by uplc qtof ms five intermediates were found in phenol photodegradation using the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane scheme 1 they include catechol hydroquinone and resorcinol with m z 109 and a retention time rt at 1 306 0 688 and 0 769 min respectively these products were formed by the attack of o h radicals to different positions of the benzene ring some previous studies have ever indicated the formation of these substances 4 19 49 also it was stated that phenol was easily attacked at para position 50 to form hydroquinone therefore 1 4 benzoquinone and 1 1 biphenyl 4 4 ol were probably formed by further oxidation and combination reaction from this available by product in the case of m nitrophenol on the other hand two major intermediates were detected scheme 2 the first one with m z 154 was formed by electrophilic addition reaction of o h radical to the benzene ring 51 this product then attacks and opens the benzene ring to release succinic acid m z 117 the intermediates formed during uv photocatalysis of binary phenol and m nitrophenol were also detected scheme 3 among 5 observed products the one with m z 125 was formed by dihydroxyl addition reaction of oh to the benzene ring in phenol molecule and that with m z 154 was formed from a similar reaction in m nitrophenol molecule these two compounds were further oxidized to release the products with m z 157 and 145 respectively due to the presence of m nitrophenol the degradation reaction of phenol was retarded and fewer intermediates from phenol were observed besides a new intermediate with a larger molecular weight than the parent molecules m z 201 was probably formed by a combination reaction of the compounds with m z 125 and or 154 it is evident that the use of the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane not only changes the degradation rates of phenol and m nitrophenol in the binary system but also the number of the released intermediates the mechanisms of the present photodegradation processes can be expressed as follows the pollutants were first absorbed on the surface of tio2 and or go by π π interaction or hydrogen bonding under uv irradiation tio2 was excited and generated electrons e and holes h the photogenerated electrons can be trapped in the π π network of graphene sheets 24 leading to the decrease in the recombination rate of electron hole pairs the ability to capture photogenerated electrons by graphene and other carbon based nanomaterials has been reported earlier 11 24 52 by prolonging the lifetime of e h pairs more radicals will be released according to the reactions shown in eqs 2 and 3 on the other hand the generation of oh and o 2 radicals in the tio2 graphene system has been well discussed previously 53 55 these active radicals will attack the organic pollutants and produce the intermediates if the photocatalysis time is long enough these intermediates should be eventually decomposed to form simple products such as co2 h2o and no2 3 4 reusability of the photocatalytic membranes to check the reusability of the composite membrane for degradation routes we collected and washed the used membrane by ethanol and water several times to remove any adsorbed impurities it was then dried and ready for the next cycle fig 11 illustrates the results of the pvdf g aa tgo 50 composite membrane in the photodegradation of m nitrophenol the removal of m nitrophenol after 180 min irradiation slightly decreased from 38 in the first cycle to 37 in the second cycle also it still reached over 30 after the fifth cycle this indicates that the composite membrane was stable after photodegradation and could be applied practically 4 conclusions the plasma activated grafting technique is an effective surface modification method for pvdf membranes in a short time tio2 and go were well immobilized and dispersed on the surface of the membrane just using a small amount of tio2 go 0 125 g l the high removal was achieved for phenol and m nitrophenol for example 78 of phenol 0 53 mm and 54 of m nitrophenol 0 18 mm could be degraded after 3 h irradiation in single systems for a binary mixture of phenol m nitrophenol the removal reached 65 and 22 within 3 h respectively the uplc qtof ms analysis revealed that the degradation of phenol was retarded and fewer intermediates from phenol were formed due to the presence of m nitrophenol moreover the prepared composite membranes showed excellent reusability after five cycles the immobilization of tio2 go nanoparticles on the membrane made no recovery steps for instance filtration required for practical applications besides the hydrophilicity of the membrane was improved which was promising for further applications in water and wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

13935,in this study various weight ratios of titania tio2 and graphene oxide go mixed powders were coated on the surface of microporous poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes after the membranes were activated by argon plasma and immediately grafted with acrylic acid such composite membranes were first characterized by x ray diffractometry xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and water contact angle measurements these composite membranes were then applied to remove phenol and m nitrophenol in the single and binary systems under

of electron hole pairs in contrast to traditional suspended catalyst systems the as prepared composite membranes were proven to be more economic and efficient materials for the removal of organic pollutants finally the intermediates produced during uv photocatalysis of single and binary phenol m nitrophenol using the composite membranes were detected and identified by uplc qtof ms and the degradation pathways were proposed accordingly keywords titania graphene oxide poly vinylidene fluoride membrane photocatalysis phenolic compounds 1 introduction many methods have been often applied to treat organic pollutants including phenolic compounds for example adsorption with multiple absorbents such as iron oxide activated carbon zeolite resins etc 1 2 electrochemical oxidation heterogeneous photocatalysis and oxidation with chemical oxidants 3 among the aforementioned methods photocatalysis using tio2 has been received much consideration due to the high chemical stability and cost effectiveness of tio2 be very stable and active under uv light tio2 could be used in many types of water samples 4 in principle when tio2 particles are irradiated by uv light with an energy greater than or equal to the bandgap electrons from the valence band are excited and transferred to the conduction band leaving holes h eq 1 holes then can react with water molecules absorbed on the surface of tio2 releasing hydroxyl radicals o h eq 2 the electrons react with the dissolved oxygen molecules to form super oxygen radicals o2 eq 3 then h oh and o 2 can decompose organic pollutants to the products eq 4 1 t i o 2 h ν h e 2 h h 2 o o h h 3 e o 2 o 2 4 h o h o 2 p o l l u tan t s int e r m e d i a t e s f i n a l p r o d u c t s to enhance photocatalytic performance of tio2 some efforts have tried to support tio2 nanoparticles on support or carrier this is because the agglomeration of tio2 suspensions that causes a large decrease in surface area should be avoided in some cases the powder type support such as graphene oxide go or reduced graphene oxide rgo can play as an electron reservoir and transporter of electrons photo generated during tio2 excitation 5 7 the mentioned charge carriers are freely transferred through graphene sheets decreasing the recombination rate of electron hole pairs thus enhancing photocatalytic performance of tio2 graphene systems besides the negatively charged and high surface area of graphene sheets benefits the enhancement of the adsorption rate of organics in water especially cationic dyes like methylene blue however an additional method such as filtration is still required to recover all nanoparticles from the solution for reuse when tio2 or tio2 go suspensions are applied this will make photocatalysis rather costly and time consuming for practical applications to meet the requirements of reducing agglomeration and easy recovery a microporous polymer membrane support was adopted to immobilize tio2 nanoparticles or tio2 go nanohybrids in this study 8 a literature survey indicates that two main types of such composite membranes have been prepared for effective antifouling via self cleaning effect 9 11 and for enhanced photocatalysis 12 18 in the former case for example laohaprapanon et al 9 studied the coating of zno on poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane to reduce fouling through photooxidation process zno particles were synthesized by co precipitation of zinc acetate with oxalic acid at 60 c results showed that the membrane hydrophilicity is largely improved by the self assembly of zno and the water flux is enhanced the zno coated membrane severely fouled after the filtration of alginate 1 wt can fully recover its original flux under uv irradiation for 30 min in the latter case for instance fischer et al 12 have synthesized tio2 particles at the surface of polyethersulfone pes and pvdf membranes via hydrolysis of titanium tetraisopropoxide as a result a non aggregated and strongly bonded layer of tio2 particles was built on the membrane surface the pvdf membranes with crystallized tio2 showed satisfactory photodegradation of methylene blue dye and drugs under uv irradiation at a density of 7 6 mw cm2 however the photodegradation kinetics of dye and drugs were not analyzed quantitatively in their research in this study a mixture of tio2 and go materials was coated and immobilized on the surface of a microporous hydrophobic pvdf membrane after the membrane was activated by argon plasma and then grafted by acrylic acid such composite membranes were commonly called as photocatalytic membranes pvdf membrane was chosen due to its strong mechanical property thermal stability and chemical resistance 9 11 12 the plasma grafting fabrication was not only rapid and facial but also easy to tune the surface of the membrane such that its supporting ability for both tio2 and go was increased the surface morphology and physicochemical properties of the prepared photocatalytic membranes were first studied the photocatalytic ability of the composite membranes was then evaluated through the degradation of organic pollutants two phenolic compounds including phenol and m nitrophenol were selected as model pollutants here partly because they are considered as priority pollutants by the u s environmental protection agency 1 3 moreover uv light photocatalysis was widely used to treat phenolic compounds previously particularly phenol over suspended tio2 particles 19 26 which enables us to evaluate the performance of this study the intermediates formed during uv photocatalysis of single and binary phenol m nitrophenol using as prepared photocatalytic membranes were also detected and identified by a high resolution liquid

thermal scientific co to prepare tio2 based photoanodes for photocurrent measurements we immersed indium doped tin oxide glass ito with an area of 5 5 cm2 in pvdf tio2 and pvdf tgo 50 slurries separately at room temperature for 2 h which were designated to tio2 and tgo 50 photoanodes respectively after the immersion coating the prepared photoanodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 c overnight the photocurrent measurement was carried out in a three electrode configuration system chi 608 using 200 ml distilled water ph 6 8 as the electrolyte solution herein pt wire and ag agcl served as the counter and the reference electrodes respectively an uv c lamp 100 w was turned on and off successively for generating and powering off the photocurrent response from both photoanodes the chronoamperometry tests were conducted in a zennium electrochemical workstations zahner elektrik gmbh co germany at a constant potential of 0 3 v vs ag agcl for a period of 50 s 2 5 photodegradation experiments photodegradation experiments were carried out in a photoreactor equipped with a uv c lamp 100 w hl 100ch 5 sen lights co osaka japan as shown in fig 1 the uv lamp intensity was 6 5 0 1 mw cm2 which was regularly checked by a uv radiometer uv mo03a orc manufacturing co tokyo japan the lamp was put in a doubled wall quartz tube which was connected to a cooling system for maintaining the temperature of the reactor at 25 c briefly 800 ml of the solution containing phenol m nitrophenol or their mixture was prepared and poured into the reactor one piece of the photocatalytic membrane was attached to the inner surface of the reactor and fully immersed in the solution the solution was magnetically stirred at the speed of 50 rpm and the ph of the solution was adjusted by 0 1 m of hcl or naoh solution at pre set time intervals 1 ml of the solution was taken out and the remaining concentration of phenolic compound was determined by hplc in some cases the intermediates produced during photocatalysis were detected and identified by lc qtof ms analysis the photodegradation efficiency of the present process was expressed by its removal calculated by eq 5 5 r e m o v a l 100 c 0 c t c 0 where c 0 and c t are the concentrations of phenolic compound at the beginning and at time t respectively mm 2 6 analytical methods the concentrations of phenol and m nitrophenol in single and binary systems were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc jasco japan equipped with a c18 reversed phase column model 00g 3172 e0 particle size 5 μm the temperature of the column was maintained at 35 c the conditions for the determination of phenol and m nitrophenol were shown in table 1 the transformation products formed during photocatalysis of phenol and or m nitrophenol were detected and identified by qtof ms waters xevo g2 xs equipped with an acquity uplc i class system milford ma usa a waters acquity beh c18 column 2 1 50 mm 1 7 μm

min then back to the initial condition of 5 solution b the mass spectrometry was detected by electrospray ionization in a negative mode esi 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of tio2 go composite membrane multiple measurements were applied to confirm the successful synthesis of as prepared materials fig 2 a shows the xrd patterns of graphite go and tio2 the disappearance of a sharp diffraction peak at 2θ 26 and the appearance of two new peaks at 2θ around 11 and 43 which are the characteristic peaks of go 28 indicating the complete oxidation of graphite to go this is also confirmed by raman spectra fig 3 with a clear appearance of the d band generated at 1353 cm 1 due to the out of plane vibration of the structural defect caused by oxygen containing groups of go fig 2b illustrates the xrd patterns of pristine pvdf membrane the membranes after plasma activation only plasma treated pvdf after grafting by acrylic acid only pvdf g aa and after final coating with tgo 50 pvdf g aa tgo 50 in comparison with the pristine membrane the plasma treated pvdf and pvdf g aa membranes remain the natural structure of pvdf this indicates that plasma activation and the subsequent grafting process have no impact on the crystal structure of pvdf 29 from the xrd patterns of pvdf g aa tgo 50 the diffraction peak at 2θ 25 3 corresponds to the reflection of the anatase phase of tio2 particles the absence of the diffraction peaks of go and tio2 is probably due to homogeneous dispersion of go on the surface of tio2 particles instead of stacking together 30 fig 4 shows the ftir spectra of pristine and plasma treated pvdf membranes as well as pvdf g aa and pvdf g aa tgo 50 composite membranes the ftir spectra of pvdf membrane present the vibration bands at 496 843 and 880 cm 1 indicating the β phase of pvdf whereas the peaks in the range from 1060 to 1254 cm 1 are ascribed to cf2 vibration 31 for the pvdf g aa membrane the appearance of an absorption band at 1728 cm 1 corresponding to co stretching vibration results from the grafting of aa onto pvdf 32 in ftir spectra of pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane the band at 1390 cm 1 that is very close to the peak 1410 cm 1 ch2 vibration of pvdf is attributed to co stretching vibration of the functional groups in go 33 it was reported that the vibration of ti o appears in the range of 400 1000 cm 1 31 33 however it is not so apparent in the ftir spectra of the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane this is likely due to a low amount of tio2 go coated on the membrane surface although the xrd patterns and increased peak intensity in the range of 400 1000 cm 1 indicate the contribution of tio2 in the composite membrane fig 5 a shows the surface morphology of the pristine pvdf membrane resembling a spider web of connected nano spherical particles this structure was almost unchanged after plasma treatment fig 5b after grafting with aa some pores in the pvdf membrane were blocked however this only happened on the surface of the pvdf membrane fig 5f this well agrees with the results reported in clochard et al 34 which indicated that aa is not possible to reach the inner part of the pvdf membrane the distribution of tio2 and go on the surface of the membranes with different tio2 loadings is shown in fig 5d h it is seen that tio2 was dispersed on the sheet like go surface for the membranes with 25 wt and 50 wt tio2 fig 5d e when the weight percent of tio2 is larger than 75 the agglomeration happens to form clusters of tio2 particles the serious agglomeration behavior of tio2 particles occurs in the absence of go fig 5h the wettability of pristine and modified pvdf membranes was studied via contact angle measurements as shown in fig 6 the water contact angle of the raw pvdf membrane was 116 8 3 9 and decreased to 65 1 0 9 after plasma treatment this is because the membrane surface becomes rougher or the surface pores are widened after plasma treatment 35 after grafting with aa some hydroxyl groups may be formed on the surface of the pvdf membrane 36 leading to the water contact angle down to 49 1 1 6 the hydrophilicity was further increased after the grafted membrane was coated with tio2 go this is due to the contribution of oxygenated hydrophilic groups in go 37 the hydrophilic improvement of the membranes demonstrates an increased water flux or permeability which promises to further their application in water wastewater treatment fig 7 a shows the chronoamperometry curves of both photoanodes in aqueous electrolyte when successively and suddenly switching white light on and off both potentiostatic currents are found to decrease rapidly in the initial stage whereas they remain stable after 20 s the steady state polarization curves reveal that the stable current of tgo 50 photoanode is approximately 7 6 times higher than that of tio2 photoanode this result indicates that tgo 50 electrode exhibits superior photocatalytic activity and excellent stability than the pristine one the process of electron hole recombination can be expressed by the following kinetic equation 38 39 6 d i t i f i i i f exp t τ where d is a dimensionless factor related to the variation of current change with time t τ is a parameter defined as the transient time constant i is the photoanode current and the subscripts i and f signify the initial and final steady state as shown in fig 7 a the initial increase in the photocurrent is followed by an exponential decrease with time this initial maximum anodic spike is attributed to the separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs at the semiconductor electrolyte interface 39 40 the photocurrent decay reveals that recombination processes are occurring holes reaching the semiconductor surface may instead of capturing electrons from the electrolyte accumulate at the surface and recombine with electrons from the conduction band therefore the photocurrent decay is determined by the rate at which the minority carriers trapped at the surface states capture the majority carriers the transient time constant is related to the relaxation time i e the period needed for the concentration of photocarriers within the film to reach a constant level 38 40 fig 7 b depicts two linear correlations of ln d versus t for both photoanodes where the τ values can be determined from the slope of the linear plots the excellent correlation coefficients for tio2 r 2 0 980 and tgo 50 r 2 0 997 photoanodes reflects satisfactory linearity the τ value of tgo 50 electrode reaches as high as 2 43 s which is 1 53 times longer than that of tio2 electrode 1 59 s the short relaxation time is likely associated with a higher number of recombination centers in the crystalline tio2 electrode this improved τ value of tgo 50 electrode is ascribed to the presence of go sheets offering a stereo conductive framework that effectively alleviates the electron hole recombination rate this mainly originates from the unique architecture where the go sheets embedded in the tio2 photoanode provide well developed network for electron conduction reducing the possibility for electron hole recombination 3 2 photodegradation experiments 3 2 1 effect of tio2 loading as shown in the fe sem images go in the composite membrane is present as sheets for anchored tio2 and the weight ratio of tio2 to go can affect the dispersion of tio2 on the membrane surface to find the optimal ratio four composite membranes with 25 wt 50 wt 75 wt and 100 wt of tio2 in tio2 go were used for the removal of phenol and m nitrophenol as shown in fig 8 a b both phenol and m nitrophenol were hard to be degraded under uv photolysis only under the conditions studied phenolic compounds were effectively degraded in the presence of composite membranes for instance the removal of phenol and m nitrophenol was 70 and 44 within 3 h using the pvdf g aa tgo 25 membrane respectively they were increased to 78 and 54 in the case of the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane it is expected that more active radicals will be generated to attack organic compounds when tio2 loading is increased however the removal of phenol and m nitrophenol decreased to 74 and 48 respectively for further addition of tio2 up to 75 wt at a high tio2 loading the agglomeration of tio2 particles happened leading to a decrease in specific surface area thereby the generation of radicals as well as the interaction between pollutants and radicals on the catalyst surface decreased this behavior was observed using the membrane with 100 tio2 where the removal of phenol and m nitrophenol was 61 and 28 respectively here go sheets can not only support tio2 particles by physisorption electrostatic binding or charged transfer interaction 7 but also reduce their agglomeration an optimal tio2 loading of 50 wt in the tio2 go mixture was chosen in this study the photodegradation of binary phenol 0 53 mm and m nitrophenol 0 18 mm using different composite membranes was studied and shown in fig 8c d the trend of removal efficiency with increasing tio2 loading was similar to the single systems both phenol and m nitrophenol showed the best removal using the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane however in comparison with the single system the removal of both pollutants was decreased particularly the removal of phenol decreased from 78 to 65 but from 54 to 22 for m nitrophenol the more significant decrease in m nitrophenol removal 32 can be explained by the ability of the interaction between two organics and the composite membrane according to catherine et al 41 oh containing compounds such as phenolics can form hydrogen bond with oxygen functional groups in go however no2 in m nitrophenol has electrophilic property 42 leading to the difficulty to form a hydrogen bond therefore phenol molecules easily interact with the composite membrane than m nitrophenol this also reflects the slower removal of m nitrophenol in both single and binary systems compared to phenol in which the adsorption was not prominent the langmuir hinshelwood l h model is commonly applied to describe the kinetics of heterogeneous catalysis the l h model basically relates the degradation rate r mm min to the surface coverage of the organics on the catalyst θs as follows 7 r d c t d t k θ s k k l c t 1 k l c t where k is the intrinsic rate constant mm min k l is the langmuir adsorption constant mm 1 and c t is the reactant concentration at time t mm the l h model can be simplified to the pseudo first order kinetic equation when the solution is comparatively diluted as also stated previously 19 43 eq 7 then becomes eq 8 8 r d c t d t k a p p c t where k app is the apparent first order rate constant min 1 by integrating eq 8 we have 9 ln c t c 0 k a p p t as shown in fig 9 the logarithm graphs based on eq 9 cannot show a linear relationship in the entire reaction time alternatively we can obtain two good linear regressions following the pseudo first order kinetics with the apparent rate constant k 1 and k 2 respectively one possible reason for leading to such transition around 60 min is the threshold coverage of composite membrane surface due to the adsorption of reaction intermediates 20 this means that the surface of the composite membrane is not yet occupied by the intermediates in the initial stage after that period the intermediates start to occupy the membrane surface sites thereby decreasing the degradation rate of the pollutant as shown in table 2 the removal of phenol in the first 60 min was more quickly than that of m nitrophenol after that time the rate was insignificantly different from similar k 2 values 3 2 2 effect of solution ph it is accepted that solution ph is one of the important factors because it can cause a change not only in surface charge of the catalyst but also in the ionization degree of the pollutants leading to a change in the interaction between them 44 fig 10a b show the effect of solution ph on the degradation of single phenol and m nitrophenol using the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane the removal of phenol and m nitrophenol was low in strongly acidic and alkaline media in particular 66 and 42 of phenol were degraded at ph 4 and 10 respectively within 3 h while 18 and 27 of m nitrophenol were removed respectively the pk a value of phenol and m nitrophenol is reported to be 9 9 and 8 4 respectively 45 46 the phenolic compound is present in neutral forms when the solution ph is less than pk a and becomes negatively charged as phenolate when the solution ph is larger than pka moreover the zero point of charge for tio2 was reported to be around 6 0 47 this explains the low removal in a strongly alkaline medium because the material and phenol are both negatively charged leading to electrostatic repulsion the high removal of phenol and m nitrophenol at their natural ph which is 6 68 and 5 41 respectively again indicates that the prominent interaction between the organics and material is hydrogen bonding and π π interaction rather than electrostatic interaction while phenol presents better removal in neutral and weakly acidic media but poorer removal in an alkaline medium in a binary system it is found that the trends for m nitrophenol are different fig 10c the best removal of m nitrophenol occurs in an alkaline medium ph 10 this could be explained by the ability to form a hydrogen bond of m nitrophenol in an alkaline medium under this condition the negative charge on the surface of tio2 formed by oh acts as a ligand on ti iv 48 that is m nitrophenol will change to phenolate with a more negative charge at the nitrogen group therefore the hydrogen bonding became stronger between the nitrogen group and oh on the surface of tio2 besides the electrostatic repulsion of phenol and tio2 led to more chance than the interaction of m nitrophenol with the material resulting in better degradation of m nitrophenol under alkaline conditions table 3 compiles the apparent first order degradation rate constants k app obtained in this work and reported earlier using suspended catalysts although the literature results obtained under comparable conditions solution ph catalyst dose power intensity etc to the present study are unavailable the prepared composite membranes are proven to be more efficient and economic photocatalysts according to the k app values for phenol considering the comparatively small dose of the catalysts used in this work 3 3 degradation pathways the transformation products released during uv photocatalysis were identified by uplc qtof ms five intermediates were found in phenol photodegradation using the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane scheme 1 they include catechol hydroquinone and resorcinol with m z 109 and a retention time rt at 1 306 0 688 and 0 769 min respectively these products were formed by the attack of o h radicals to different positions of the benzene ring some previous studies have ever indicated the formation of these substances 4 19 49 also it was stated that phenol was easily attacked at para position 50 to form hydroquinone therefore 1 4 benzoquinone and 1 1 biphenyl 4 4 ol were probably formed by further oxidation and combination reaction from this available by product in the case of m nitrophenol on the other hand two major intermediates were detected scheme 2 the first one with m z 154 was formed by electrophilic addition reaction of o h radical to the benzene ring 51 this product then attacks and opens the benzene ring to release succinic acid m z 117 the intermediates formed during uv photocatalysis of binary phenol and m nitrophenol were also detected scheme 3 among 5 observed products the one with m z 125 was formed by dihydroxyl addition reaction of oh to the benzene ring in phenol molecule and that with m z 154 was formed from a similar reaction in m nitrophenol molecule these two compounds were further oxidized to release the products with m z 157 and 145 respectively due to the presence of m nitrophenol the degradation reaction of phenol was retarded and fewer intermediates from phenol were observed besides a new intermediate with a larger molecular weight than the parent molecules m z 201 was probably formed by a combination reaction of the compounds with m z 125 and or 154 it is evident that the use of the pvdf g aa tgo 50 membrane not only changes the degradation rates of phenol and m nitrophenol in the binary system but also the number of the released intermediates the mechanisms of the present photodegradation processes can be expressed as follows the pollutants were first absorbed on the surface of tio2 and or go by π π interaction or hydrogen bonding under uv irradiation tio2 was excited and generated electrons e and holes h the photogenerated electrons can be trapped in the π π network of graphene sheets 24 leading to the decrease in the recombination rate of electron hole pairs the ability to capture photogenerated electrons by graphene and other carbon based nanomaterials has been reported earlier 11 24 52 by prolonging the lifetime of e h pairs more radicals will be released according to the reactions shown in eqs 2 and 3 on the other hand the generation of oh and o 2 radicals in the tio2 graphene system has been well discussed previously 53 55 these active radicals will attack the organic pollutants and produce the intermediates if the photocatalysis time is long enough these intermediates should be eventually decomposed to form simple products such as co2 h2o and no2 3 4 reusability of the photocatalytic membranes to check the reusability of the composite membrane for degradation routes we collected and washed the used membrane by ethanol and water several times to remove any adsorbed impurities it was then dried and ready for the next cycle fig 11 illustrates the results of the pvdf g aa tgo 50 composite membrane in the photodegradation of m nitrophenol the removal of m nitrophenol after 180 min irradiation slightly decreased from 38 in the first cycle to 37 in the second cycle also it still reached over 30 after the fifth cycle this indicates that the composite membrane was stable after photodegradation and could be applied practically 4 conclusions the plasma activated grafting technique is an effective surface modification method for pvdf membranes in a short time tio2 and go were well immobilized and dispersed on the surface of the membrane just using a small amount of tio2 go 0 125 g l the high removal was achieved for phenol and m nitrophenol for example 78 of phenol 0 53 mm and 54 of m nitrophenol 0 18 mm could be degraded after 3 h irradiation in single systems for a binary mixture of phenol m nitrophenol the removal reached 65 and 22 within 3 h respectively the uplc qtof ms analysis revealed that the degradation of phenol was retarded and fewer intermediates from phenol were formed due to the presence of m nitrophenol moreover the prepared composite membranes showed excellent reusability after five cycles the immobilization of tio2 go nanoparticles on the membrane made no recovery steps for instance filtration required for practical applications besides the hydrophilicity of the membrane was improved which was promising for further applications in water and wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

13936,agro industrial wastes can become organic aids for coagulation being an alternative to metallic coagulants in this study ripe okra abelmoschus esculentus and passion fruit passiflora edulis seeds were prepared characterized and used as natural coagulants in experiments of coagulation dissolved air flotation c daf treating synthetic dairy wastewater sdw c daf was carried out using central composite design ccd for optimization of variables in ccd the effects of coagulant dosage and ph independent variables were studied removal of turbidity and chemical oxygen demand cod dependent variables were evaluated and regression models to predict the removal of these variables were adjusted and validated the optimum conditions found for removing turbidity and cod were okra dosage of 2 0 g l 1 at ph 9 00 and passion fruit seeds dosage of 1 3 g l 1 at ph 5 00 okra as coagulant reduced 91 1 of turbidity and 48 3 of cod whereas passion fruit seeds reduced 91 5 of turbidity and 50 3 of cod from the sdw okra and passion fruit seeds proved to be promising sources for obtaining coagulant agent replacing metallic coagulants and minimizing the production of agro industrial wastes keywords okra passion fruit coagulation flocculation sludge circular economy 1 introduction several disadvantages are associated with the use of metallic coagulants for water treatment they are strongly dependent on ph 1 2 consume alkalinity 3 and in the case of aluminum salts its use is very controversial because it is associated with alzheimer s disease 4 5 besides the use of chemical coagulants generates large volumes of sludge containing toxic substances causing environmental problems thus industries need to invest in newtechnologies for treatment and disposal of this sludge which leads to increased operating costs 6 7 in this context the seek for potential alternative coagulants preferably natural and renewable safe for humans biodegradable and which produce low amounts of sludge have been the object of study 1 8 10 okra abelmoschus esculentus is a vegetable of great economic and food importance grown in tropical and subtropical areas 11 14 and has attracted the attention due to its coagulation flocculation properties 12 15 16 when mature okra becomes stiff and inappropriate for consumption generating waste okra has water soluble polysaccharides capable of destabilizing colloidal suspended particles forming flocs an interesting property for wastewater treatment 16 19 another common residue from fruit pulp processing industries is the seeds of passion fruit passiflora edulis brazil is currently the world s largest producer of passion fruit generating large amounts of residues which often do not have an appropriate destination 20 passion fruit residues have the potential to be used in wastewater treatment 21 22 using both okra or passion fruit seeds as natural coagulant also provides economical advantages preventing operations associated with the disposal of these residues and adding value to agro industrial by products the dairy industries are considered to be one of the largest consumers of water among the food industries 23 24 liquid effluents generated in dairy industries are characterized by high levels of dissolved solids suspended solids oils and greases with high biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients for this reason it is necessary to treat this effluent before it is discharged into water bodies 25 27 among the physical chemical processes for treatment of dairy wastewater coagulation dissolved air flotation c daf has been applied as chemically enhanced primary treatment and has gained prominence because it is a technology that requires reduced area reduces costs of implementing treatment systems and provides high levels of efficiency in removing pollutants especially oils and greases 28 29 however in primary treatment the coagulants used to improve the process of flocs formation are usually metallics and the treatment generates large volumes of sludge with undesirable characteristics due to the use of metallic coagulants in the process the use of agro industrial residues as coagulants also fits into the concepts of circular economy and bioeconomics since in this study the aim is to improve the efficiency of the coagulation process by minimizing the coagulant dosage in addition to exploring the potential for reuse waste and allow the beneficial use of the by product sludge generated in the process in turn in terms of bioeconomics the production and application of a naturally occurring coagulant stands out making effluent treatment move towards a sustainable process performance of okra and passion fruit seeds as alternative coagulating agents in wastewater treatment are scarce in literature the potential of these agro industrial residues on treatment of dairy effluents has not yet been reported in this research okra and passion fruit seeds were prepared and properly characterized to be used as alternative coagulants for dairy wastewater treatment the potential of these wastes as natural coagulant in removal of turbidity and chemical oxygen demand cod from synthetic dairy wastewater sdw was studied dissolved air flotation was used and the removal of pollutants was evaluated by varying the coagulant dosage and ph levels using response surface methodology rsm 2 methods 2 1 synthetic dairy wastewater since wastewater generated in dairy industries vary in their characteristics in this study synthetic dairy wastewater sdw was used according to the formulation proposed by healy et al 30 according to these authors this formulation is suitable for simulating dairy wastewater and does not have the whey generated in cheese making in its composition the use of synthetic wastewater allows greater control over the process standardizes the test conditions and allows replicability of the process 28 29 the following substances were dissolved in 20 l of tap water whole milk powder 28 800 mg glucose 48 mg urea 54 000 mg ammonium chloride 11 666 mg sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate 18 000 mg sodium bicarbonate

grade the characteristics of the sdw are shown in table 1 2 2 coagulants 2 2 1 obtaining and preparing yellow passion fruit seeds and ripe okra were used as natural coagulant source both materials are classified as waste and come from some type of activity or agro industrial processing passion fruit was obtained in the local market of viçosa mg brazil the pulp was removed from the ripe fruits and the seeds were separated from the pulp manually the seeds were washed in tap water to remove excess pulp and dried in a forced air circulationoven model ma 035 marconi for 4 h at 150 c after drying the seeds were crushed in domestic blender and sieved to standardize the size particles with size less than 0 85 mm were used as coagulant agent to obtain the okra coagulant ripe fruits usually rejected by consumers were used the okra fruits were also obtained in the local market of viçosa mg brazil adapted method of anastasakis et al 15 was used for preparation of the coagulant agent the ripe okra fruits were dried in a forced air circulation oven model ma 035 marconi for 8 h at 110 c cooled to room temperature crushed in domestic blender and sieved to standardize particles size particles between 0 30 and 0 85 mm were used as coagulant agent particles larger than 0 85 mm tended to sediment rather than float and particles smaller than 0 35 mm left a high residual value of dissolved organic carbon in the treated effluent which is undesirable the potential of okra and passion fruit seeds as a coagulant agent was evaluated using the powder of these materials in natura thus no saline solution was used as an active agent since we sought to establish a simple low cost method without the addition of chemicals in this study the powdered particulate material from both sources of coagulant obtained after sieving was used as coagulant agent in coagulation flocculation experiments 2 2 2 characterization of okra and passion fruit seeds the main functional groups of both coagulant agents were identified by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy shimadzu irprestige 21 for this kbr disks were prepared by mixing the coagulant with kbr in the proportion 1 200 w w the absorption spectra were recorded in the range of 400 to 4000 cm 1 scanning electron microscopy sem was performed using a scanning electron microscope jsm 5800 l v with a semafore 5 21 image capture system to analyze the surface morphology and elemental composition of the coagulant agents zeta potential and particle size were performed a nano zs malvern panalytical zetasizer equipment was used in this analysis the surface charge of the particles was measured at the ph studied in the experimental design 5 00 7 00 and 9 00 2 3 experimental design in the experimental design the effect of the coagulant agents in removal of turbidity and cod from sdw was evaluated by varying the concentration of coagulant at different ph central composite rotational design ccrd was used to optimize coagulant dosage and ph the use of ccrd includes the following advantages obtaining the results with a smaller number of experiments estimating the interaction between the factors under study and developing empirical mathematical models that provide optimization conditions that is find the values of the variables that will generate the best desired response ccrd design consisted of a factorial 22 plus four axial α points and five central points totaling thirteen tests that were carried out in random sequence the value of α was calculated as a function of the number of independent variables k 2 using eq 1 1 α 2k 1 4 1 414 where α are the values of the axial points and k is the number of independent variables the maximum and minimum levels of factors were chosen based on values commonly used for natural coagulants reported in literature 2 8 31 32 and after preliminary tests table 2 shows the levels of the factors studied in ccrd design with the respective codifications 2 4 coagulation dissolved air flotation c daf coagulation flocculation tests were carried out in jar test the system was mixed at 200 rpm for 1 min after adding the coagulant 1 l of sdw was used in each assay the ph was adjusted to the desired value using 1 2 hcl 36 38 vetec and naoh 97 vetec solutions the coagulant dosages and the ph values studied are shown in table 2 flocculation was performed at 30 rpm for 15 min after flocculation sdw was transferred manually from the beaker to the flotation column slowly so that there was no breakage of flocs formed dissolved air flotation daf was used to separate the flocs formed in the coagulation flocculation of the sdw in daf the water is saturated with air dissolved under pressure this supersaturated flow is recirculated pressurized and then mixed with the effluent where the microscopic bubble attaches to the solids and raises them to the surface forming a floating bed of sludge the floated sludge is removed by a surface scraper in this study a flotatest 218 3 flow new ethics was used composed of a compressor air saturation chamber and flotation column the operational conditions at daf were saturation pressure 8 bar recirculation ratio 20 flotation speed 10 cm min 1 flotation time 5 min and saturation time 2 min all of these operating conditions have been studied and optimized by pereira et al 29 1 l of tap water was added to the saturation chamber the compressor was activated and air was injected into the saturation chamber being dissolved in water at a pressure of 8 0 bar air injection was kept in saturation chamber for 2 min after this period the valve that connects the saturation chamber to the flotation column was opened for the application of saturated water referring to the recirculation ratio in this procedure a time of approximately 30 s was required upon reaching the recirculation rate the valve was closed and waited 5 min for the particle flotation process then a 0 5 l sample was collected at the bottom of the column for analysis of residual turbidity and cod 2 5 determination of turbidy and cod determinations of turbidity and cod were performed before and after c daf following standard methodology 33 turbidity was determined using a portable turbidimeter model a03010 thermo while cod was quantified by closed reflux method taking the readings on a spectrophotometer model 700 plus femto at a wavelength of 600 nm values of turbidity and cod removed r were determined using eq 2 and the removal efficiency ε was calculated using eq 3 proposed by couto et al 34 2 r x 0 v 0 xv 3 ε 1 xv x 0 v 0 x 100 where r is the removed turbidity ntu or removed cod mg l 1 ε is the relative removal efficiency x is the turbidity ntu or cod mg l 1 of the sdw after c daf v l is the treated sdw volume obtained at the end of the c daf considering the recirculated volume x0 is the turbidity ntu or cod mg l 1 before c daf and v0 l is the sdw volume to be treated at the beginning of the process 2 6 statistical analysis the effect of ph and coagulant in removing turbidity and cod was assessed using pareto charts at level of 5 of statistical significance second order polynomial regression models that correlate removed turbidity or removed cod as function of the coagulant dosage and ph were generated analysis of variance anova was used to assess the quality of fit of the models the simultaneous optimization of the response variables was performed using the desirability function 35 the method is based on the definition of a desirability function for each response with restricted values in the range of 0 1 values close to zero indicate an undesirable response while values around 1 are desirable regression models were validated by means of three extra independent tests a test was performed in the optimized condition of dosage of coagulant and ph the other two tests were carried out at random levels of coagulant dosage and ph obtained by lot and different from the conditions tested to obtain the models experimentally turbidity and cod removal was evaluated under the 3 conditions established for validation and the values obtained experimentally were compared with the values predicted by the adjusted models the relative error has been calculated 2 7 sdw characterization after c daf sdw was characterized after treatment in the optimized condition in relation to the following variables ph turbidity cod biochemical oxygen demand bod and organic compounds that absorb in the ultraviolet region at 254 nm uv254 and ratio bod cod turbidity bod cod and uv254 values were also obtained after sdw was treated and filtered through glass microfiber filters whatman gf a of 1 00 μm cutoff and 45 mm of diameter bod was determined by quantifying dissolved oxygen in the samples performed by electrometric method using an oximeter model hq430d hach the other variables were determined according to standard methods established in apha 33 the ph was measured using a bench phmeter model q 400a quimis cod was determined by closed reflux method as previously described for the determination of uv254 compounds the absorbance at 254 nm wavelength was done in a spectrophotometer model 700 plus femto using a 1 cm quartz cuvette for this analysis the sample was filtered using glass microfiber filters whatman gf a of 1 00 μm cutoff and 45 mm of diameter in order to control the variations that may exist related to the presence of particles in suspension the sludge volume produced on c daf in optimal condition for each coagulant agent was calculated using eq 4 4 v π r 2 h where v is flotated sludge volume m³ r is radius of the flotation column m and h is height of sludge floated in the column m to calculate dry sludge volume the flotated sludge was separated from effluent by means of filtration in a 1 00 μm glass fiber membrane and dried in aforced air circulation oven model ma 035 marconi 105 c for 45 min then the sludge capsule was allowed to cool in a desiccator and its weight was quantified using an analytical balance sludge volume was expressed by the difference in weight of capsule with sludge by the weight of capsule without sludge 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of coagulant agents ftir spectrum of the passion fruit seeds and okra are shown in fig 1 the absorption band in the region around 3350 and 3450 cm 1 corresponds to oh and nh stretching vibrations as well as the intramolecular hydrogen bonds despite the great variation of results found in the literature regarding the chemical structure of okra mucilage it can be mentioned that the polysaccharides that comprise it are galactose rhamnose and galacturonic acid thus the regions of 2926 and 2850 cm 1 show typical polysaccharide peaks being known respectively as asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of ch it can be noted that these peaks have a greater intensity for the passion fruit seeds whose chemical structure presents a greater complexity due to the triglyceride molecules in the oils and high protein content in face of being in fingerprint region the peak at 1163 cm 1 for passion fruit seeds is more pronounced being attributed as cn stretches of the amines constituents of proteins present in this coagulant in this case it can be concluded that the bands are made up of multiple individual sub peaks originating from different groups ch vibrating in asymmetric and symmetric modes likewise a intensity more pronounced can be observed at 1745 cm 1 for the passion fruit seed this band is attributed to the elongation of co in groups of esters and can be confirmed by the better definition of the band at 1456 cm 1 compared to the spectrum of the okra the band at 1456 cm 1 is attributed to the symmetrical vibrational mode of the co bond in the coo in general the region below 1700 cm 1 for polysaccharides is a region of numerous peak overlays in different ways stretching wagging and scissoring thus assignments made in that region can be mistaken still the ftir shows the structural difference between the two coagulants passion fruit seeds have a characteristic spectrum of an oily content and okra has a spectrum typically of a polysaccharide seed sem was used to analyze the physical morphology of surfaces of the coagulants fig 2 illustrates the images obtained from the passion fruit seeds fig 2a and b and okra fig 2c and d at 27 and 500 times of magnification despite the irregular structure of both natural coagulants shown in fig 2 okra mucilage has a more porous surface with more homogeneous cavities which suggest more adsorption sites surface area compared to the passion fruit seeds data obtained in this work shows that passion fruit seeds reduce the zeta potential table 7 suggesting predominance of neutralization mechanisms to the detriment of adsorption mechanisms on the other hand adsorption mechanisms would be predominant in okra mucilage these data corroborate the images obtained for the two coagulants chandra mohan et al 36 also observed an irregular structure of okra mucilage polysaccharide molecules in the form of linear sheets with each sheet having a width of 1 2 μm and length in the range of 90 140 μm 3 2 experimental results results of removing turbidity and cod are shown in tables 3 and 4 using passion fruit seeds and okra as coagulant respectively the use of okra and passion fruit seeds as a coagulant agent on c daf of sdw resulted in different levels of efficiency in removing turbidity and cod depending on the variation of ph and dosage of coagulant the representativeness of each factor in removal of turbidity and cod can be seen in pareto chart fig 3 at the level of 5 of statistical significance the pareto chart was used in order to identify the variables that most influence the removal of turbidity and cod the effects of the factors coagulant dosage and ph are shown in descending order of importance in removing pollutants from the sdw the factors whose bar exceeds the vertical line are significant p 0 05 due to the measure of evidence p value in the sdw turbidity and cod response the length of each bar is proportional to the absolute value of the estimated effect for each factor as well as for the interaction these graphs allow comparing the importance of each parameter in removing turbidity and cod fig 3 a and b show the effects of factors using passion fruit seed and fig 3 c and d show the effects of factors using okra as coagulant agent in fig 3 it is possible to compare the relative magnitude and statistical significance of each factor as well as its tendency to optimization through the absolute values of the standardized effects positive values of the estimated standardized effects for dosage l indicate that increasing the coagulant dosage will result in increased turbidity and cod removal for both coagulants in relation to cod removal fig 3b and d the interaction between ph and coagulant dosage is statistically significant p 0 05 and has a positive effect in cod removal for both coagulants thus it is possible to conclude that cod removal is affected by the coagulant dosage and it is ph dependent and vice versa on the other hand when the okra is used as coagulant the interaction between ph and dosage has no significant effect in removing turbidity fig 3a negative estimated absolute values for the linear ph effect and quadratic dosing effect fig 3a b and d indicate that the lower these values are the greater the efficiency of removing turbidity and cod from sdw different behavior is observed when removing turbidity using okra fig 3c meaning that an increase of ph promotes a positive effect in removing turbidity based on the pareto diagrams it was decided to eliminate non significant variables p 0 05 for the generation of mathematical models since these variables have little contribution for explaining obtained results 37 40 thus for the two coagulants used the interaction was removed from the mathematical models for removing turbidity the removal of the dosage ph interaction generated simpler models without causing damage to the adjustment in addition to increasing the accuracy of the predictors 3 3 analysis of variance regression coefficients of the uncoded variables were determined and second order mathematical models were generated which describe the removal of turbidity and cod as a function of ph and dosage of passion fruit seed eq 5 and 6 and okra eq 7 and 8 5 removed turbidity ntu 2371 0 4119 dosagep fruit 632 ph 0 000122 dosage²p fruit 43 35 ph² 6

5 and 6 respectively the values of r² and adjusted r² indicate good fit of the chosen model 41 43 when r² value approaches 1 00 better will be the model and the error will be smaller models with values of r² greater than 0 60 can be used for predictive purposes 44 according to barros neto et al 44 for a regression to be not only significant but also useful for predictive purposes the fcalculated ftabulated ratio of regression must be greater than four box wetz criterion which is observed for the four models generated furthermore the lack of adjustment was not significant at level of 5 probability which is desirable in obtaining a regression model the relationship between observed values of turbidity and cod removed versus predicted values by the adjusted regression models is shown in fig 4 the grouping of points around the diagonal line indicates a good correlation between the values obtained in the experiment and the values predicted by the models which confirms its robustness 42 45 47 3 4 turbidity removal response surfaces of removed turbidity as function of ph and dosage of coagulant are shown in fig 5 for both coagulants studied the turbidity removal efficiency is strongly dependent on coagulant dosage and ph by varying ph within the studied range even without addition of coagulant turbidity removal efficiency tends to increase reaching up to 300 ntu of turbidity removed at ph 5 00 and 9 00 however with addition of coagulant greater removals of turbidity are reached even without ph changing thus it can be concluded that the addition of coagulant in c daf allows a significant cleaning of the pollutant load of sdw in a single step since it increases the efficiency of coagulation and flocculation and can accelerate the sedimentation of particles similar results were observed by santos et al 32 when using commercial natural coagulants acquapol ww acquapol s5t tanfloc sl and tanfloc sg in the coagulation flocculation sedimentation of cassava processing wastewater according to these authors the use of coagulants in the primary treatment provided significant removals of the parameters color 77 5 and turbidity 88 5 from the studied effluent in this study we observed greater efficiency in removing turbidity using passion fruit seed at acid ph which demonstrates the potential of this residue as a coagulating agent for the treatment of this type of effluent protein molecules present in passion fruit seeds have an amphoteric character and the protein charge is highly dependent on ph at lower phs positive charges on the amino acids of protein molecules are predominant and the coagulant agent act well in acidic medium at higher phs the appearance of negative charges in protein amino acids reduces the ability of the coagulant in process 48 in percentage terms it is noted in fig 6 a that the removal efficiency is about 80 0 with dosage of 1707 0 mg l 1 of passion fruit seed at ph 5 58 at ph 7 00 turbidity removal efficiency tends to decrease as the passion fruit seed dosage is increased this can be explained due to the increase in solids suspended in sdw promoted by the coagulant agent itself thus it is not feasible to apply coagulant dosages above 2000 0 mg l 1 when the ph is close to 7 00 which is in line with other studies reported in the literature that used organic coagulants on dairy wastewater treatment 28 49 applying okra at ph 7 00 only 28 4 ntu of turbidity was removed fig 5b the best conditions for removing turbidity using okra were obtained at ph 5 58 and ph 8 42 89 15 and 91 73 removal efficiency respectively with 1707 0 mg l 1 of okra dosage similar to that observed for largest removals using passion fruit seed reducing the dosage of okra to 1000 0 mg l 1 and increasing ph to 9 00 sdw turbidity reduced from 698 0 72 5 ntu 89 62 removal efficiency indicating that with less amount of coagulant similar turbidity removal efficiency can be achieved in contrast to passion fruit seed results okra showed good coagulation performance in both acid and alkaline medium the inhibition of coagulation using passion fruit seeds in alkaline medium is related to the presence of proteins in its seeds as previously described according to agarwal et al 18 a change in ph does not affect the efficiency of natural polymers however there may be an effect of the ph change on the constituents of wastewater which could imply a decrease in the coagulation efficiency at some ph values these authors observed changes in the percentage of removal of solids as the ph varied the variation in removal efficiency observed was attributed to the effect of ph on the constituents of sewage wastewater freitas et al 16 optimized the coagulation flocculation of effluent from textile industry by applying okra as an auxiliary agent of flocculation these authors observed that the turbidity removal efficiency was 97 24 using 3 2 mg l 1 of okra at ph between 5 00 and 6 00 and ferric chloride fecl36h2o 0 37 mol l 1 as coagulant the use of okra as auxiliary agent of flocculation resulted in reduction of up to 72 5 from 320 0 88 0 mg l 1 in amount of ferric chloride used in effluent treatment which shows the potential of okra to be used in coagulation flocculation 16 although the amount of okra used by freitas et al 16 is less than that found in this work as ideal it is noteworthy that in this study the treatments were chemical coagulant free leading to results in a totally eco friendly process bioeconomic and with generation of biodegradable sludge justina et al 50 used vegetable tannin and polyaluminium chloride pac on treatment of dairy effluent it was observed by these authors that the tannin performed better at lower concentrations reaching removals of 72 2 86 6 and 89 4 of turbidity with 100 0 200 0 and 300 0 mg l 1 respectively the pac provided turbidity removals of 49 2 74 6 and 81 8 at these same dosages with dosages above 400 0 mg l 1 both coagulants studied showed similar results above 200 0 mg l 1 of tannin the increase in turbidity removal was not significant the same result was observed for pac with dosage above 400 0 mg l 1 50 an amount of flocculant above the ideal causes the aggregate particles to disperse again in the suspension and also disturb the entrainment of particles thus increasing the concentration of solids in the treated effluent 18 the effect of ph in removal of turbidity is as significant as that of coagulant dosage but with less magnitude the highest turbidity removal efficiencies observed in this study occurred at the extreme ph values studied that is at ph close to 5 00 using passion fruit seed and at ph near to 5 00 and 9 00 using okra in accordance with the results shown here justina et al 50 observed that the efficiency of removing turbidity from dairy effluent using tannin was above 90 in the ph range between 5 00 and 10 00 agarwal et al 17 cite that natural polysaccharides exhibit variable behavior due to changes in ph and contact time of the coagulant with the particles present in medium these authors observed that the efficiency of removing suspended solids in tannery wastewater using okra as flocculant was 98 26 and 93 08 at acid ph 4 00 and at alkaline ph 9 20 respectively after 1 h of contact time at ph 7 00 these same authors report that the maximum removal of suspended solids was 91 55 and was observed only after 3 h of contact which makes the treatment at neutral ph unfeasible due to the long time required 3 5 cod removal response surfaces of removed cod as a function of ph and coagulant dosage of passion fruit seeds and okra are shown in fig 6 cod removal of the sdw was mainly influenced by the dosage of coagulant agent for both coagulants the effective removal of cod occurs with a dosage between 800 0 and 1800 0 mg l 1 above 1800 0 mg l 1 removal efficiency tends to decrease low cod removal efficiency is noted when compared to turbidity removal being attributed to the presence of recalcitrant compounds of difficult degradation present in sdw besides that the organic nature of the coagulants may contribute to the increase in residual cod the presence of natural organic charge in the coagulants increases the organic load of the solution corraborating with the results calculated of the biodegradability of the treated sdw although an increase in the organic load of the effluent is not desirable the increase in the biodegradability of the effluent favors a subsequent biological treatment in case the treated effluent does not reach the standard limits of desirable pollutants for release using passion fruit seed fig 6a the highest removal efficiency occurred with a dosage of 1000 0 mg l 1 at ph 5 00 meaning a removal of approximately 48 0 keeping ph between 5 00 and 6 00 does not justify the use of dosages above 1000 0 mg l 1 since the removal efficiency tends to decrease ferrari et al 51 report that the oil extracted from passion fruit seeds has a high content of unsaturated fatty acids 87 5 defatted bran in turn has 15 6 proteins 0 68 lipids 59 9 fibers and 12 4 carbohydrates the presence of such compounds in passion fruit seeds may contribute to the increase in residual cod especially unsaturated fatty acids since in this study oil seed extraction was not carried out to obtain the coagulant agent these results are supported by findings from antov et al 52 who applied fava bean extract to remove water turbidity according to the authors an extract with a higher amount of protein provides an increase in the residual cod of the treated water fig 6 b shows cod removal using okra it can be observed that in absence of coagulant agent removals of up to 1000 0 mg l 1 of cod can be obtained at a ph less than 5 50 however the application of okra resulted in removals above 1500 0 mg l 1 of cod increasing the coagulant concentration to values above 1500 0 mg l 1 decreased the removal of cod in the tested ph range the largest removals occurred with dosage of okra equal to 1000 0 mg l 1 at ph close to 5 00 where the removal efficiency was 47 4 similar results were observed in a study performed by anastasakis et al 15 while studying the effect of okra as a flocculant treating synthetic effluent and biologically treated effluent it was observed that an increase in the flocculant dose above a certain value causes an increase in the cod of the effluent freitas et al 16 observed a maximum reduction in cod of wastewater from the textile industry of 48 33 and 52 45 under conditions of ph 5 00 and 6 00 respectively these same authors also observed that with increased coagulant dosage there was no significant reduction in cod above the optimal dosage the particles can stabilize again due to the reversal of their loads 16 excessive amount of flocculant causes the aggregate particle to disperse in the suspension and also disturb the drag of particles when daf is used in the separation phase 18 coagulant dosages below the optimum may not have sufficient loads for effective homogeneous removal 53 in the pareto diagram fig 3 it was shown that the effect of ph in the removal of cod is dependent on the dosage of coagulant which can also be seen in fig 6 the increase of ph contributed negatively for cod removal due to its negative coefficient fig 3b and d however with dosage above 1200 mg l 1 there is a very high removal efficiency at a ph close to 9 00 especially when okra is used as coagulant agent cod removal efficiency values near to those obtained in the aforementioned condition can also be obtained with lower concentration of coagulant and keeping the ph close to 5 00 allowing a certain flexibility of the optimal condition of operation in treatment units in relation to the ph pavan et al 21 used passion fruit peels to remove methylene blue dye from aqueous effluents and observed that adsorption increased with increasing ph with the optimum ph value between 7 00 and 10 00 according to the same authors this can be explained due to the electrostatic attraction existing between the surface of the adsorbent which is negatively charged mainly pectin and methylene blue which is a cationic dye at acidic ph there is an excess of h ions in the medium that compete with the dye for the adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface of the passion fruit peel at alkaline medium the number of positively charged sites decreases and the number of negatively charged sites increases which favors the elimination of the cationic dye 21 okolo et al 54 used okra to remove suspended particles of brewery effluent and observed high coagulant activity at ph 2 00 and 10 00 lik khai lim et al 55 applied okra m oleifera and alumen to remove fluoride and aluminum from synthetic wastewater and observed that the ph range of the natural coagulants is much more extensive than the chemical coagulant range 3 6 zeta potential zeta potential and size particles of okra passion fruit seeds untreated sdw and treated sdw is shown in table 7 okra had negative surface charge over the entire ph range studied ranging from 21 6 to 25 9 mv table 7 the results obtained are in agreement with other studies reported in the literature 56 59 yuan et al 59 measured the zeta potential of okra gum by varying the ph from 7 00 2 00 according to the results obtained okra showed a surface charge of 30 mv at ph 7 00 apparently due to its high component of galacturonic acid remaining close to this value at ph 6 00 and then slowly loses its charge as the ph drops close to the pk of galacturonic acid these same authors did not observe an isoelectric point since the okra gum has no amines or other basic residues in these macromolecules the zeta potential is essentially a function of ionizable residues which remain undisturbed in their relative positions in the macromolecular chains 59 okra is rich in polysaccharides composed of galactose rhamnose and galacturonic acid 36 58 60 61 the main structural element of the okra polysaccharide contains a repeating unit with alternating rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues and carries disaccharide side chains composed of galactose connected to rhamnose residues 57 in turn passion fruit seeds also showed negative zeta potential value in all studied ph values and the magnitude of the negative charge was diminishing as the ph became acidic sena et al 62 report that passion fruit seeds have functional groups such as coo free groups providing negative surface charge in an aqueous medium analyzing the zeta potential values of the treated sdw with passion fruit seeds there is a reduction in negative charges from 27 7 mv at ph 9 00 to 16 mv at ph 5 00 the lowest value of zeta potential was observed at ph 5 00 in which there was greater efficiency in removing pollutants the reduction in zeta potential value is associated with the charge neutralization mechanism that occurs with higher coagulant dosages as observed in this study although the charge neutralization mechanism is suggested for passion fruit seeds as coagulant it is known that the reduction of the zeta potential from 22 mv to 16 mv was not sufficient for the effective removal of pollutants as it was observed so maybe another mechanism is associated with the removal of pollutants by the passion fruit seeds polymeric coagulants are generally associated with adsorption and charge neutralization adsorption and bridging and patch mechanism 16 study of coagulation flocculation mechanisms depends on several parameters that have not been considered in this study floculation defloculation refloculation studied are needed to discuss the flocculation mechanism of each coagulant agent 3 7 optimization and validation from the adjusted models that represent the removal of turbidity and cod from the sdw it was possible to optimize the different responses for this an individual desirability is calculated for each response and weights each one based on the importance attributed to them these values are combined to determine the overall desirability of the system with multiple responses an ideal solution occurs when composite desirability reaches its maximum which is 1 63 65 based on this concept the following points were found as optimum for removal of turbidity and cod 1 dosage of passion fruit seeds equal to 1252 5 mg l 1 at ph 5 00 and 2 dosage of okra equal to 1999 8 mg l 1 at ph 9 00 to confirm and validate the prediction of the regression models three independent tests were performed for each coagulant one at the optimal point of removal and the other two at random points within the studied intervals the values obtained through the models were compared with the values obtained experimentally and the relative error was calculated validation results using passion fruit seed are shown in table 8 and using okra are shown in table 9 as shown in table 9 only at the optimum point for turbidity removal using okra the estimated and experimental data did not show good adjustment on the other hand in the other points all the results obtained experimentally are in close agreement with the values predicted by the adjusted models presenting a low relative error the values of turbidity and cod removed obtained experimentally are within the estimated confidence interval and probability likely to have a probability coefficient equals to 95 validating and indicating the reliability of the regression models adjusted for prediction purposes 46 66 67 3 8 characterization of sdw in the optimal treatment condition after c daf in the optimal condition of coagulant dosage and ph to remove turbidity and cod sdw was characterized in relation to the following variables ph turbidity cod bod uv254 compounds bod cod ratio sludge volume produced and volume of dry sludge the results are shown in table 10 high removal of turbidity cod bod and uv254 was observed at the optimum point for both coagulants indicating that they have high potential to be used in the c daf of dairy wastewater there was an increase in the biodegradability of the sdw shown by the bod cod ratio which is explained by the characteristic of the type of coagulants because they are natural the coagulant may have contributed to the increase in the fraction of carbonaceous organic matter labile to degradation by microorganisms contributing for further secondary treatment when necessary 68 70 the filtration step after coagulation flocculation flotation was applied only as a complement to the process in many industries after the primary chemical treatment it is common for the effluent to still go through a filtration process in order to adjust the polluting load in accordance with current legislation in case the applied treatment has not placed it within the conditions for release in this case the filtration served to remove possible particles and colloidal material that were not dragged in the flotation process the volume of sludge produced varied according to the dosage of coagulant used thereby the okra generated a greater volume of sludge in the process an alternative to the final disposal of the sludge would be its use in agriculture as a fertilizer and soil conditioner because it is organic full of nutrients and on top of that it has the advantage of not carrying toxic substances 25 31 71 triques et al 72 applied moringa oleifera extract in primary treatment of dairy wastewater and measured the volume of sludge produced the results found indicate that about 0 132 m³ of sludge is produced for each 1 0 m³ of treated wastewater and 1 0 kg of dry sludge for each 1 m³ of treated wastewater comparing these values with those obtained in this study it is observed that the okra and passion fruit seeds generated less volume of sludge when compared to the moringa oleifera regarding the volume of dry sludge it is observed that okra generated a higher volume of sludge which is directly related to the higher dosage found to be optimal however there is a greater efficiency of solid liquid separation in this study than in the procedure employed by triques et al 72 which highlights greater efficiency of daf in the solid liquid separation according to mowla et al 73 the efficient separation of liquid and solid in the sludge is one of the main steps in reducing the costs of treatment transportation and final sludge disposal the volume of sludge produced by okra and passion fruit seeds is relatively low when compared to the volume that was produced in the treatment of dairy effluent using the chemical coagulants feso4 and kal so4 2 12h2o 74 prabhakaran et al 75 also observed that the use of natural coagulant extracted from eirchorrnia crassipes reduced the volume of sludge produced on treatment of textile effluents when compared to chemical coagulants in addition the sludge obtained from natural coagulant is eco friendly and biodegradable and can be used as an organic fertilizer for plants 75 the volume of sludge produced in the water treatment using the pac organic coagulant proved to be higher than the volume produced when the pac pdmdaac hybrid coagulant was used 76 although hybrid coagulants show potential for generating more compact sludge 77 obtaining these types of coagulants involves procedures that can make the use of these products inconvenient such as requiring chemical products increasing production costs and possibly generating waste 78 4 conclusion agro industrial residues ripe okra and passion fruit seeds were used in the chemically enhanced primary treatment of synthetic dairy wastewater as natural coagulants and showed promising results to replace metalic coagulants besides that the tested coagulants in this work have great environmental appeal and the sludge produce would no longer be a waste but it can be used as a fertilizer the results showed that the application of the central composite design was efficient in modeling the removal of turbidity and cod from the effluent the ph and dosage of coagulant agent were significant p 0 05 in removing turbidity and cod the optimum points found for removing turbidity and cod were 2 0 g l 1 of okra at ph 9 00 and 1 3 g l 1 of passion fruit seed at ph 5 00 in the optimized condition the efficiency of removing turbidity and cod using okra as coagulant was 91 1 and 48 3 respectively the efficiency of the passion fruit seed as coagulant provided efficiency of removing turbidity and cod of 91 5 and 50 3 respectively the application of okra and passion fruit seeds as a coagulant increased the biodegradability of the treated effluent the volume of dry sludge produced was 1 563 kg m ³ using okra and 0 835 kg m ³ using passion fruit seed

13936,agro industrial wastes can become organic aids for coagulation being an alternative to metallic coagulants in this study ripe okra abelmoschus esculentus and passion fruit passiflora edulis seeds were prepared characterized and used as natural coagulants in experiments of coagulation dissolved air flotation c daf treating synthetic dairy wastewater sdw c daf was carried out using central composite design ccd for optimization of variables in ccd the effects of coagulant dosage and ph independent variables were studied removal of turbidity and chemical oxygen demand cod dependent variables were evaluated and regression models to predict the removal of these variables were adjusted and validated the optimum conditions found for removing turbidity and cod were okra dosage of 2 0 g l 1 at ph 9 00 and passion fruit seeds dosage of 1 3 g l 1 at ph 5 00 okra as coagulant reduced 91 1 of turbidity and 48 3 of cod whereas passion fruit seeds reduced 91 5 of turbidity and 50 3 of cod from the sdw okra and passion fruit seeds proved to be promising sources for obtaining coagulant agent replacing metallic coagulants and minimizing the production of agro industrial wastes keywords okra passion fruit coagulation flocculation sludge circular economy 1 introduction several disadvantages are associated with the use of metallic coagulants for water treatment they are strongly dependent on ph 1 2 consume alkalinity 3 and in the case of aluminum salts its use is very controversial because it is associated with alzheimer s disease 4 5 besides the use of chemical coagulants generates large volumes of sludge containing toxic substances causing environmental problems thus industries need to invest in newtechnologies for treatment and disposal of this sludge which leads to increased operating costs 6 7 in this context the seek for potential alternative coagulants preferably natural and renewable safe for humans biodegradable and which produce low amounts of sludge have been the object of study 1 8 10 okra abelmoschus esculentus is a vegetable of great economic and food importance grown in tropical and subtropical areas 11 14 and has attracted the attention due to its coagulation flocculation properties 12 15 16 when mature okra becomes stiff and inappropriate for consumption generating waste okra has water soluble polysaccharides capable of destabilizing colloidal suspended particles forming flocs an interesting property for wastewater treatment 16 19 another common residue from fruit pulp processing industries is the seeds of passion fruit passiflora edulis brazil is currently the world s largest producer of passion fruit generating large amounts of residues which often do not have an appropriate destination 20 passion fruit residues have the potential to be used in wastewater treatment 21 22 using both okra or passion fruit seeds as natural coagulant also provides economical advantages preventing operations associated with the disposal of these residues and adding value to agro industrial by products the dairy industries are considered to be one of the largest consumers of water among the food industries 23 24 liquid effluents generated in dairy industries are characterized by high levels of dissolved solids suspended solids oils and greases with high biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients for this reason it is necessary to treat this effluent before it is discharged into water bodies 25 27 among the physical chemical processes for treatment of dairy wastewater coagulation dissolved air flotation c daf has been applied as chemically enhanced primary treatment and has gained prominence because it is a technology that requires reduced area reduces costs of implementing treatment systems and provides high levels of efficiency in removing pollutants especially oils and greases 28 29 however in primary treatment the coagulants used to improve the process of flocs formation are usually metallics and the treatment generates large volumes of sludge with undesirable characteristics due to the use of metallic coagulants in the process the use of agro industrial residues as coagulants also fits into the concepts of circular economy and bioeconomics since in this study the aim is to improve the efficiency of the coagulation process by minimizing the coagulant dosage in addition to exploring the potential for reuse waste and allow the beneficial use of the by product sludge generated in the process in turn in terms of bioeconomics the production and application of a naturally occurring coagulant stands out making effluent treatment move towards a sustainable process performance of okra and passion fruit seeds as alternative coagulating agents in wastewater treatment are scarce in literature the potential of these agro industrial residues on treatment of dairy effluents has not yet been reported in this research okra and passion fruit seeds were prepared and properly characterized to be used as alternative coagulants for dairy wastewater treatment the potential of these wastes as natural coagulant in removal of turbidity and chemical oxygen demand cod from synthetic dairy wastewater sdw was studied dissolved air flotation was used and the removal of pollutants was evaluated by varying the coagulant dosage and ph levels using response surface methodology rsm 2 methods 2 1 synthetic dairy wastewater since wastewater generated in dairy industries vary in their characteristics in this study synthetic dairy wastewater sdw was used according to the formulation proposed by healy et al 30 according to these authors this formulation is suitable for simulating dairy wastewater and does not have the whey generated in cheese making in its composition the use of synthetic wastewater allows greater control over the process standardizes the test conditions and allows replicability of the process 28 29 the following substances were dissolved in 20 l of tap water whole milk powder 28 800 mg glucose 48 mg urea 54 000 mg ammonium chloride 11 666 mg sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate 18 000 mg sodium bicarbonate 31 200 mg magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 12 000 mg ferrous sulfate heptahydrate 480 mg manganese sulfate monohydrate 480 mg and calcium chloride dihydrate 720 mg all reagents used are of analytical grade the characteristics of the sdw are shown in table 1 2 2 coagulants 2 2 1 obtaining and preparing yellow passion fruit seeds and ripe okra were used as natural coagulant source both materials are classified as waste and come from some type of activity or agro industrial processing passion fruit was obtained in the local market of viçosa mg brazil the pulp was removed from the ripe fruits and the seeds were separated from the pulp manually the seeds were washed in tap water to remove excess pulp and dried in a forced air circulationoven model ma 035 marconi for 4 h at 150 c after drying the seeds were crushed in domestic blender and sieved to standardize the size particles with size less than 0 85 mm were used as coagulant agent to obtain the okra coagulant ripe fruits usually rejected by consumers were used the okra fruits were also obtained in the local market of viçosa mg brazil adapted method of anastasakis et al 15 was used for preparation of the coagulant agent the ripe okra fruits were dried in a forced air circulation oven model ma 035 marconi for 8 h at 110 c cooled to room temperature crushed in domestic blender and sieved to standardize particles size particles between 0 30 and 0 85 mm were used as coagulant agent particles larger than 0 85 mm tended to sediment rather than float and particles smaller than 0 35 mm left a high residual value of dissolved organic carbon in the treated effluent which is undesirable the potential of okra and passion fruit seeds as a coagulant agent was evaluated using the powder of these materials in natura thus no saline solution was used as an active agent since we sought to establish a simple low cost method without the addition of chemicals in this study the powdered particulate material from both sources of coagulant obtained after sieving was used as coagulant agent in coagulation flocculation experiments 2 2 2 characterization of okra and passion fruit seeds the main functional groups of both coagulant agents were identified by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy shimadzu irprestige 21 for this kbr disks were prepared by mixing the coagulant with kbr in the proportion 1 200 w w the absorption spectra were recorded in the range of 400 to 4000 cm 1 scanning electron microscopy sem was performed using a scanning electron microscope jsm 5800 l v with a semafore 5 21 image capture system to analyze the surface morphology and elemental composition of the coagulant agents zeta potential and particle size were performed a nano zs malvern panalytical zetasizer equipment was used in this analysis the surface charge of the particles was measured at the ph studied in the experimental design 5 00 7 00 and 9 00 2 3 experimental design in the experimental design the effect of the coagulant agents in removal of turbidity and cod from sdw was evaluated by varying the concentration of coagulant at different ph central composite rotational design ccrd was used to optimize coagulant dosage and ph the use of ccrd includes the following advantages obtaining the results with a smaller number of experiments estimating the interaction between the factors under study and developing empirical mathematical models that provide optimization conditions that is find the values of the variables that will generate the best desired response ccrd design consisted of a factorial 22 plus four axial α points and five central points totaling thirteen tests that were carried out in random sequence the value of α was calculated as a function of the number of independent variables k 2 using eq 1 1 α 2k 1 4 1 414 where α are the values of the axial points and k is the number of independent variables the maximum and minimum levels of factors were chosen based on values commonly used for natural coagulants reported in literature 2 8 31 32 and after preliminary tests table 2 shows the levels of the factors studied in ccrd design with the respective codifications 2 4 coagulation dissolved air flotation c daf coagulation flocculation tests were carried out in jar test the system was mixed at 200 rpm for 1 min after adding the coagulant 1 l of sdw was used in each assay the ph was adjusted to the desired value using 1 2 hcl 36 38 vetec and naoh 97 vetec solutions the coagulant dosages and the ph values studied are shown in table 2 flocculation was performed at 30 rpm for 15 min after flocculation sdw was transferred manually from the beaker to the flotation column slowly so that there was no breakage of flocs formed dissolved air flotation daf was used to separate the flocs formed in the coagulation flocculation of the sdw in daf the water is saturated with air dissolved under pressure this supersaturated flow is recirculated pressurized and then mixed with the effluent where the microscopic bubble attaches to the solids and raises them to the surface forming a floating bed of sludge the floated sludge is removed by a surface scraper in this study a flotatest 218 3 flow new ethics was used composed of a compressor air saturation chamber and flotation column the operational conditions at daf were saturation pressure 8 bar recirculation ratio 20 flotation speed 10 cm min 1 flotation time 5 min and saturation time 2 min all of these operating conditions have been studied and optimized by pereira et al 29 1 l of tap water was added to the saturation chamber the compressor was activated and air was injected into the saturation chamber being dissolved in water at a pressure of 8 0 bar air injection was kept in saturation chamber for 2 min after this period the valve that connects the saturation chamber to the flotation column was opened for the application of saturated water referring to the recirculation ratio in this procedure a time of approximately 30 s was required upon reaching the recirculation rate the valve was closed and waited 5 min for the particle flotation process then a 0 5 l sample was collected at the bottom of the column for analysis of residual turbidity and cod 2 5 determination of turbidy and cod determinations of turbidity and cod were performed before and after c daf following standard methodology 33 turbidity was determined using a portable turbidimeter model a03010 thermo while cod was quantified by closed reflux method taking the readings on a spectrophotometer model 700 plus femto at a wavelength of 600 nm values of turbidity and cod removed r were determined using eq 2 and the removal efficiency ε was calculated using eq 3 proposed by couto et al 34 2 r x 0 v 0 xv 3 ε 1 xv x 0 v 0 x 100 where r is the removed turbidity ntu or removed cod mg l 1 ε is the relative removal efficiency x is the turbidity ntu or cod mg l 1 of the sdw after c daf v l is the treated sdw volume obtained at the end of the c daf considering the recirculated volume x0 is the turbidity ntu or cod mg l 1 before c daf and v0 l is the sdw volume to be treated at the beginning of the process 2 6 statistical analysis the effect of ph and coagulant in removing turbidity and cod was assessed using pareto charts at level of 5 of statistical significance second order polynomial regression models that correlate removed turbidity or removed cod as function of the coagulant dosage and ph were generated analysis of variance anova was used to assess the quality of fit of the models the simultaneous optimization of the response variables was performed using the desirability function 35 the method is based on the definition of a desirability function for each response with restricted values in the range of 0 1 values close to zero indicate an undesirable response while values around 1 are desirable regression models were validated by means of three extra independent tests a test was performed in the optimized condition of dosage of coagulant and ph the other two tests were carried out at random levels of coagulant dosage and ph obtained by lot and different from the conditions tested to obtain the models experimentally turbidity and cod removal was evaluated under the 3 conditions established for validation and the values obtained experimentally were compared with the values predicted by the adjusted models the relative error has been calculated 2 7 sdw characterization after c daf sdw was characterized after treatment in the optimized condition in relation to the following variables ph turbidity cod biochemical oxygen demand bod and organic compounds that absorb in the ultraviolet region at 254 nm uv254 and ratio bod cod turbidity bod cod and uv254 values were also obtained after sdw was treated and filtered through glass microfiber filters whatman gf a of 1 00 μm cutoff and 45 mm of diameter bod was determined by quantifying dissolved oxygen in the samples performed by electrometric method using an oximeter model hq430d hach the other variables were determined according to standard methods established in apha 33 the ph was measured using a bench phmeter model q 400a quimis cod was determined by closed reflux method as previously described for the determination of uv254 compounds the absorbance at 254 nm wavelength was done in a spectrophotometer model 700 plus femto using a 1 cm quartz cuvette for this analysis the sample was filtered using glass microfiber filters whatman gf a of 1 00 μm cutoff and 45 mm of diameter in order to control the variations that may exist related to the presence of particles in suspension the sludge volume produced on c daf in optimal condition for each coagulant agent was calculated using eq 4 4 v π r 2 h where v is flotated sludge volume m³ r is radius of the flotation column m and h is height of sludge floated in the column m to calculate dry sludge volume the flotated sludge was separated from effluent by means of filtration in a 1 00 μm glass fiber membrane and dried in aforced air circulation oven model ma 035 marconi 105 c for 45 min then the sludge capsule was allowed to cool in a desiccator and its weight was quantified using an analytical balance sludge volume was expressed by the difference in weight of capsule with sludge by the weight of capsule without sludge 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of coagulant agents ftir spectrum of the passion fruit seeds and okra are shown in fig 1 the absorption band in the region around 3350 and 3450 cm 1 corresponds to oh and nh stretching vibrations as well as the intramolecular hydrogen bonds despite the great variation of results found in the literature regarding the chemical structure of okra mucilage it can be mentioned that the polysaccharides that comprise it are galactose rhamnose and galacturonic acid thus the regions of 2926 and 2850 cm 1 show typical polysaccharide peaks being known respectively as asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of ch it can be noted that these peaks have a greater intensity for the passion fruit seeds whose chemical structure presents a greater complexity due to the triglyceride molecules in the oils and high protein content in face of being in fingerprint region the peak at 1163 cm 1 for passion fruit seeds is more pronounced being attributed as cn stretches of the amines constituents of proteins present in this coagulant in this case it can be concluded that the bands are made up of multiple individual sub peaks originating from different groups ch vibrating in asymmetric and symmetric modes likewise a intensity more pronounced can be observed at 1745 cm 1 for the passion fruit seed this band is attributed to the elongation of co in groups of esters and can be confirmed by the better definition of the band at 1456 cm 1 compared to the spectrum of the okra the band at 1456 cm 1 is attributed to the symmetrical vibrational mode of the co bond in the coo in general the region below 1700 cm 1 for polysaccharides is a region of numerous peak overlays in different ways stretching wagging and scissoring thus assignments made in that region can be mistaken still the ftir shows the structural difference between the two coagulants passion fruit seeds have a characteristic spectrum of an oily content and okra has a spectrum typically of a polysaccharide seed sem was used to analyze the physical morphology of surfaces of the coagulants fig 2 illustrates the images obtained from the passion fruit seeds fig 2a and b and okra fig 2c and d at 27 and 500 times of magnification despite the irregular structure of both natural coagulants shown in fig 2 okra mucilage has a more porous surface with more homogeneous cavities which suggest more adsorption sites surface area compared to the passion fruit seeds data obtained in this work shows that passion fruit seeds reduce the zeta potential table 7 suggesting predominance of neutralization mechanisms to the detriment of adsorption mechanisms on the other hand adsorption mechanisms would be predominant in okra mucilage these data corroborate the images obtained for the two coagulants chandra mohan et al 36 also observed an irregular structure of okra mucilage polysaccharide molecules in the form of linear sheets with each sheet having a width of 1 2 μm and length in the range of 90 140 μm 3 2 experimental results results of removing turbidity and cod are shown in tables 3 and 4 using passion fruit seeds and okra as coagulant respectively the use of okra and passion fruit seeds as a coagulant agent on c daf of sdw resulted in different levels of efficiency in removing turbidity and cod depending on the variation of ph and dosage of coagulant the representativeness of each factor in removal of turbidity and cod can be seen in pareto chart fig 3 at the level of 5 of statistical significance the pareto chart was used in order to identify the variables that most influence the removal of turbidity and cod the effects of the factors coagulant dosage and ph are shown in descending order of importance in removing pollutants from the sdw the factors whose bar exceeds the vertical line are significant p 0 05 due to the measure of evidence p value in the sdw turbidity and cod response the length of each bar is proportional to the absolute value of the estimated effect for each factor as well as for the interaction these graphs allow comparing the importance of each parameter in removing turbidity and cod fig 3 a and b show the effects of factors using passion fruit seed and fig 3 c and d show the effects of factors using okra as coagulant agent in fig 3 it is possible to compare the relative magnitude and statistical significance of each factor as well as its tendency to optimization through the absolute values of the standardized effects positive values of the estimated standardized effects for dosage l indicate that increasing the coagulant dosage will result in increased turbidity and cod removal for both coagulants in relation to cod removal fig 3b and d the interaction between ph and coagulant dosage is statistically significant p 0 05 and has a positive effect in cod removal for both coagulants thus it is possible to conclude that cod removal is affected by the coagulant dosage and it is ph dependent and vice versa on the other hand when the okra is used as coagulant the interaction between ph and dosage has no significant effect in removing turbidity fig 3a negative estimated absolute values for the linear ph effect and quadratic dosing effect fig 3a b and d indicate that the lower these values are the greater the efficiency of removing turbidity and cod from sdw different behavior is observed when removing turbidity using okra fig 3c meaning that an increase of ph promotes a positive effect in removing turbidity based on the pareto diagrams it was decided to eliminate non significant variables p 0 05 for the generation of mathematical models since these variables have little contribution for explaining obtained results 37 40 thus for the two coagulants used the interaction was removed from the mathematical models for removing turbidity the removal of the dosage ph interaction generated simpler models without causing damage to the adjustment in addition to increasing the accuracy of the predictors 3 3 analysis of variance regression coefficients of the uncoded variables were determined and second order mathematical models were generated which describe the removal of turbidity and cod as a function of ph and dosage of passion fruit seed eq 5 and 6 and okra eq 7 and 8 5 removed turbidity ntu 2371 0 4119 dosagep fruit 632 ph 0 000122 dosage²p fruit 43 35 ph² 6

5 and 6 respectively the values of r² and adjusted r² indicate good fit of the chosen model 41 43 when r² value approaches 1 00 better will be the model and the error will be smaller models with values of r² greater than 0 60 can be used for predictive purposes 44 according to barros neto et al 44 for a regression to be not only significant but also useful for predictive purposes the fcalculated ftabulated ratio of regression must be greater than four box wetz criterion which is observed for the four models generated furthermore the lack of adjustment was not significant at level of 5 probability which is desirable in obtaining a regression model the relationship between observed values of turbidity and cod removed versus predicted values by the adjusted regression models is shown in fig 4 the grouping of points around the diagonal line indicates a good correlation between the values obtained in the experiment and the values predicted by the models which confirms its robustness 42 45 47 3 4 turbidity removal response surfaces of removed turbidity as function of ph and dosage of coagulant are shown in fig 5 for both coagulants studied the turbidity removal efficiency is strongly dependent on coagulant dosage and ph by varying ph within the studied range even without addition of coagulant turbidity removal efficiency tends to increase reaching up to 300 ntu of turbidity removed at ph 5 00 and 9 00 however with addition of coagulant greater removals of turbidity are reached even without ph changing thus it can be concluded that the addition of coagulant in c daf allows a significant cleaning of the pollutant load of sdw in a single step since it increases the efficiency of coagulation and flocculation and can accelerate the sedimentation of particles similar results were observed by santos et al 32 when using commercial natural coagulants acquapol ww acquapol s5t tanfloc sl and tanfloc sg in the coagulation flocculation sedimentation of cassava processing wastewater according to these authors the use of coagulants in the primary treatment provided significant removals of the parameters color 77 5 and turbidity 88 5 from the studied effluent in this study we observed greater efficiency in removing turbidity using passion fruit seed at acid ph which demonstrates the potential of this residue as a coagulating agent for the treatment of this type of effluent protein molecules present in passion fruit seeds have an amphoteric character and the protein charge is highly dependent on ph at lower phs positive charges on the amino acids of protein molecules are predominant and the coagulant agent act well in acidic medium at higher phs the appearance of negative charges in protein amino acids reduces the ability of the coagulant in process 48 in percentage terms it is noted in fig 6 a that the removal efficiency is about 80 0 with dosage of 1707 0 mg l 1 of passion fruit seed at ph 5 58 at ph 7 00 turbidity removal efficiency tends to decrease as the passion fruit seed dosage is increased this can be explained due to the increase in solids suspended in sdw promoted by the coagulant agent itself thus it is not feasible to apply coagulant dosages above 2000 0 mg l 1 when the ph is close to 7 00 which is in line with other studies reported in the literature that used organic coagulants on dairy wastewater treatment 28 49 applying okra at ph 7 00 only 28 4 ntu of turbidity was removed fig 5b the best conditions for removing turbidity using okra were obtained at ph 5 58 and ph 8 42 89 15 and 91 73 removal efficiency respectively with 1707 0 mg l 1 of okra dosage similar to that observed for largest removals using passion fruit seed reducing the dosage of okra to 1000 0 mg l 1 and increasing ph to 9 00 sdw turbidity reduced from 698 0 72 5 ntu 89 62 removal efficiency indicating that with less amount of coagulant similar turbidity removal efficiency can be achieved in contrast to passion fruit seed results okra showed good coagulation performance in both acid and alkaline medium the inhibition of coagulation using passion fruit seeds in alkaline medium is related to the presence of proteins in its seeds as previously described according to agarwal et al 18 a change in ph does not affect the efficiency of natural polymers however there may be an effect of the ph change on the constituents of wastewater which could imply a decrease in the coagulation efficiency at some ph values these authors observed changes in the percentage of removal of solids as the ph varied the variation in removal efficiency observed was attributed to the effect of ph on the constituents of sewage wastewater freitas et al 16 optimized the coagulation flocculation of effluent from textile industry by applying okra as an auxiliary agent of flocculation these authors observed that the turbidity removal efficiency was 97 24 using 3 2 mg l 1 of okra at ph between 5 00 and 6 00 and ferric chloride fecl36h2o 0 37 mol l 1 as coagulant the use of okra as auxiliary agent of flocculation resulted in reduction of up to 72 5 from 320 0 88 0 mg l 1 in amount of ferric chloride used in effluent treatment which shows the potential of okra to be used in coagulation flocculation 16 although the amount of okra used by freitas et al 16 is less than that found in this work as ideal it is noteworthy that in this study the treatments were chemical coagulant free leading to results in a totally eco friendly process bioeconomic and with generation of biodegradable sludge justina et al 50 used vegetable tannin and polyaluminium chloride pac on treatment of dairy effluent it was observed by these authors that the tannin performed better at lower concentrations reaching removals of 72 2 86 6 and 89 4 of turbidity with 100 0 200 0 and 300 0 mg l 1 respectively the pac provided turbidity removals of 49 2 74 6 and 81 8 at these same dosages with dosages above 400 0 mg l 1 both coagulants studied showed similar results above 200 0 mg l 1 of tannin the increase in turbidity removal was not significant the same result was observed for pac with dosage above 400 0 mg l 1 50 an amount of flocculant above the ideal causes the aggregate particles to disperse again in the suspension and also disturb the entrainment of particles thus increasing the concentration of solids in the treated effluent 18 the effect of ph in removal of turbidity is as significant as that of coagulant dosage but with less magnitude the highest turbidity removal efficiencies observed in this study occurred at the extreme ph values studied that is at ph close to 5 00 using passion fruit seed and at ph near to 5 00 and 9 00 using okra in accordance with the results shown here justina et al 50 observed that the efficiency of removing turbidity from dairy effluent using tannin was above 90 in the ph range between 5 00 and 10 00 agarwal et al 17 cite that natural polysaccharides exhibit variable behavior due to changes in ph and contact time of the coagulant with the particles present in medium these authors observed that the efficiency of removing suspended solids in tannery wastewater using okra as flocculant was 98 26 and 93 08 at acid ph 4 00 and at alkaline ph 9 20 respectively after 1 h of contact time at ph 7 00 these same authors report that the maximum removal of suspended solids was 91 55 and was observed only after 3 h of contact which makes the treatment at neutral ph unfeasible due to the long time required 3 5 cod removal response surfaces of removed cod as a function of ph and coagulant dosage of passion fruit seeds and okra are shown in fig 6 cod removal of the sdw was mainly influenced by the dosage of coagulant agent for both coagulants the effective removal of cod occurs with a dosage between 800 0 and 1800 0 mg l 1 above 1800 0 mg l 1 removal efficiency tends to decrease low cod removal efficiency is noted when compared to turbidity removal being attributed to the presence of recalcitrant compounds of difficult degradation present in sdw besides that the organic nature of the coagulants may contribute to the increase in residual cod the presence of natural organic charge in the coagulants increases the organic load of the solution corraborating with the results calculated of the biodegradability of the treated sdw although an increase in the organic load of the effluent is not desirable the increase in the biodegradability of the effluent favors a subsequent biological treatment in case the treated effluent does not reach the standard limits of desirable pollutants for release using passion fruit seed fig 6a the highest removal efficiency occurred with a dosage of 1000 0 mg l 1 at ph 5 00 meaning a removal of approximately 48 0 keeping ph between 5 00 and 6 00 does not justify the use of dosages above 1000 0 mg l 1 since the removal efficiency tends to decrease ferrari et al 51 report that the oil extracted from passion fruit seeds has a high content of unsaturated fatty acids 87 5 defatted bran in turn has 15 6 proteins 0 68 lipids 59 9 fibers and 12 4 carbohydrates the presence of such compounds in passion fruit seeds may contribute to the increase in residual cod especially unsaturated fatty acids since in this study oil seed extraction was not carried out to obtain the coagulant agent these results are supported by findings from antov et al 52 who applied fava bean extract to remove water turbidity according to the authors an extract with a higher amount of protein provides an increase in the residual cod of the treated water fig 6 b shows cod removal using okra it can be observed that in absence of coagulant agent removals of up to 1000 0 mg l 1 of cod can be obtained at a ph less than 5 50 however the application of okra resulted in removals above 1500 0 mg l 1 of cod increasing the coagulant concentration to values above 1500 0 mg l 1 decreased the removal of cod in the tested ph range the largest removals occurred with dosage of okra equal to 1000 0 mg l 1 at ph close to 5 00 where the removal efficiency was 47 4 similar results were observed in a study performed by anastasakis et al 15 while studying the effect of okra as a flocculant treating synthetic effluent and biologically treated effluent it was observed that an increase in the flocculant dose above a certain value causes an increase in the cod of the effluent freitas et al 16 observed a maximum reduction in cod of wastewater from the textile industry of 48 33 and 52 45 under conditions of ph 5 00 and 6 00 respectively these same authors also observed that with increased coagulant dosage there was no significant reduction in cod above the optimal dosage the particles can stabilize again due to the reversal of their loads 16 excessive amount of flocculant causes the aggregate particle to disperse in the suspension and also disturb the drag of particles when daf is used in the separation phase 18 coagulant dosages below the optimum may not have sufficient loads for effective homogeneous removal 53 in the pareto diagram fig 3 it was shown that the effect of ph in the removal of cod is dependent on the dosage of coagulant which can also be seen in fig 6 the increase of ph contributed negatively for cod removal due to its negative coefficient fig 3b and d however with dosage above 1200 mg l 1 there is a very high removal efficiency at a ph close to 9 00 especially when okra is used as coagulant agent cod removal efficiency values near to those obtained in the aforementioned condition can also be obtained with lower concentration of coagulant and keeping the ph close to 5 00 allowing a certain flexibility of the optimal condition of operation in treatment units in relation to the ph pavan et al 21 used passion fruit peels to remove methylene blue dye from aqueous effluents and observed that adsorption increased with increasing ph with the optimum ph value between 7 00 and 10 00 according to the same authors this can be explained due to the electrostatic attraction existing between the surface of the adsorbent which is negatively charged mainly pectin and methylene blue which is a cationic dye at acidic ph there is an excess of h ions in the medium that compete with the dye for the adsorption sites on the adsorbent surface of the passion fruit peel at alkaline medium the number of positively charged sites decreases and the number of negatively charged sites increases which favors the elimination of the cationic dye 21 okolo et al 54 used okra to remove suspended particles of brewery effluent and observed high coagulant activity at ph 2 00 and 10 00 lik khai lim et al 55 applied okra m oleifera and alumen to remove fluoride and aluminum from synthetic wastewater and observed that the ph range of the natural coagulants is much more extensive than the chemical coagulant range 3 6 zeta potential zeta potential and size particles of okra passion fruit seeds untreated sdw and treated sdw is shown in table 7 okra had negative surface charge over the entire ph range studied ranging from 21 6 to 25 9 mv table 7 the results obtained are in agreement with other studies reported in the literature 56 59 yuan et al 59 measured the zeta potential of okra gum by varying the ph from 7 00 2 00 according to the results obtained okra showed a surface charge of 30 mv at ph 7 00 apparently due to its high component of galacturonic acid remaining close to this value at ph 6 00 and then slowly loses its charge as the ph drops close to the pk of galacturonic acid these same authors did not observe an isoelectric point since the okra gum has no amines or other basic residues in these macromolecules the zeta potential is essentially a function of ionizable residues which remain undisturbed in their relative positions in the macromolecular chains 59 okra is rich in polysaccharides composed of galactose rhamnose and galacturonic acid 36 58 60 61 the main structural element of the okra polysaccharide contains a repeating unit with alternating rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues and carries disaccharide side chains composed of galactose connected to rhamnose residues 57 in turn passion fruit seeds also showed negative zeta potential value in all studied ph values and the magnitude of the negative charge was diminishing as the ph became acidic sena et al 62 report that passion fruit seeds have functional groups such as coo free groups providing negative surface charge in an aqueous medium analyzing the zeta potential values of the treated sdw with passion fruit seeds there is a reduction in negative charges from 27 7 mv at ph 9 00 to 16 mv at ph 5 00 the lowest value of zeta potential was observed at ph 5 00 in which there was greater efficiency in removing pollutants the reduction in zeta potential value is associated with the charge neutralization mechanism that occurs with higher coagulant dosages as observed in this study although the charge neutralization mechanism is suggested for passion fruit seeds as coagulant it is known that the reduction of the zeta potential from 22 mv to 16 mv was not sufficient for the effective removal of pollutants as it was observed so maybe another mechanism is associated with the removal of pollutants by the passion fruit seeds polymeric coagulants are generally associated with adsorption and charge neutralization adsorption and bridging and patch mechanism 16 study of coagulation flocculation mechanisms depends on several parameters that have not been considered in this study floculation defloculation refloculation studied are needed to discuss the flocculation mechanism of each coagulant agent 3 7 optimization and validation from the adjusted models that represent the removal of turbidity and cod from the sdw it was possible to optimize the different responses for this an individual desirability is calculated for each response and weights each one based on the importance attributed to them these values are combined to determine the overall desirability of the system with multiple responses an ideal solution occurs when composite desirability reaches its maximum which is 1 63 65 based on this concept the following points were found as optimum for removal of turbidity and cod 1 dosage of passion fruit seeds equal to 1252 5 mg l 1 at ph 5 00 and 2 dosage of okra equal to 1999 8 mg l 1 at ph 9 00 to confirm and validate the prediction of the regression models three independent tests were performed for each coagulant one at the optimal point of removal and the other two at random points within the studied intervals the values obtained through the models were compared with the values obtained experimentally and the relative error was calculated validation results using passion fruit seed are shown in table 8 and using okra are shown in table 9 as shown in table 9 only at the optimum point for turbidity removal using okra the estimated and experimental data did not show good adjustment on the other hand in the other points all the results obtained experimentally are in close agreement with the values predicted by the adjusted models presenting a low relative error the values of turbidity and cod removed obtained experimentally are within the estimated confidence interval and probability likely to have a probability coefficient equals to 95 validating and indicating the reliability of the regression models adjusted for prediction purposes 46 66 67 3 8 characterization of sdw in the optimal treatment condition after c daf in the optimal condition of coagulant dosage and ph to remove turbidity and cod sdw was characterized in relation to the following variables ph turbidity cod bod uv254 compounds bod cod ratio sludge volume produced and volume of dry sludge the results are shown in table 10 high removal of turbidity cod bod and uv254 was observed at the optimum point for both coagulants indicating that they have high potential to be used in the c daf of dairy wastewater there was an increase in the biodegradability of the sdw shown by the bod cod ratio which is explained by the characteristic of the type of coagulants because they are natural the coagulant may have contributed to the increase in the fraction of carbonaceous organic matter labile to degradation by microorganisms contributing for further secondary treatment when necessary 68 70 the filtration step after coagulation flocculation flotation was applied only as a complement to the process in many industries after the primary chemical treatment it is common for the effluent to still go through a filtration process in order to adjust the polluting load in accordance with current legislation in case the applied treatment has not placed it within the conditions for release in this case the filtration served to remove possible particles and colloidal material that were not dragged in the flotation process the volume of sludge produced varied according to the dosage of coagulant used thereby the okra generated a greater volume of sludge in the process an alternative to the final disposal of the sludge would be its use in agriculture as a fertilizer and soil conditioner because it is organic full of nutrients and on top of that it has the advantage of not carrying toxic substances 25 31 71 triques et al 72 applied moringa oleifera extract in primary treatment of dairy wastewater and measured the volume of sludge produced the results found indicate that about 0 132 m³ of sludge is produced for each 1 0 m³ of treated wastewater and 1 0 kg of dry sludge for each 1 m³ of treated wastewater comparing these values with those obtained in this study it is observed that the okra and passion fruit seeds generated less volume of sludge when compared to the moringa oleifera regarding the volume of dry sludge it is observed that okra generated a higher volume of sludge which is directly related to the higher dosage found to be optimal however there is a greater efficiency of solid liquid separation in this study than in the procedure employed by triques et al 72 which highlights greater efficiency of daf in the solid liquid separation according to mowla et al 73 the efficient separation of liquid and solid in the sludge is one of the main steps in reducing the costs of treatment transportation and final sludge disposal the volume of sludge produced by okra and passion fruit seeds is relatively low when compared to the volume that was produced in the treatment of dairy effluent using the chemical coagulants feso4 and kal so4 2 12h2o 74 prabhakaran et al 75 also observed that the use of natural coagulant extracted from eirchorrnia crassipes reduced the volume of sludge produced on treatment of textile effluents when compared to chemical coagulants in addition the sludge obtained from natural coagulant is eco friendly and biodegradable and can be used as an organic fertilizer for plants 75 the volume of sludge produced in the water treatment using the pac organic coagulant proved to be higher than the volume produced when the pac pdmdaac hybrid coagulant was used 76 although hybrid coagulants show potential for generating more compact sludge 77 obtaining these types of coagulants involves procedures that can make the use of these products inconvenient such as requiring chemical products increasing production costs and possibly generating waste 78 4 conclusion agro industrial residues ripe okra and passion fruit seeds were used in the chemically enhanced primary treatment of synthetic dairy wastewater as natural coagulants and showed promising results to replace metalic coagulants besides that the tested coagulants in this work have great environmental appeal and the sludge produce would no longer be a waste but it can be used as a fertilizer the results showed that the application of the central composite design was efficient in modeling the removal of turbidity and cod from the effluent the ph and dosage of coagulant agent were significant p 0 05 in removing turbidity and cod the optimum points found for removing turbidity and cod were 2 0 g l 1 of okra at ph 9 00 and 1 3 g l 1 of passion fruit seed at ph 5 00 in the optimized condition the efficiency of removing turbidity and cod using okra as coagulant was 91 1 and 48 3 respectively the efficiency of the passion fruit seed as coagulant provided efficiency of removing turbidity and cod of 91 5 and 50 3 respectively the application of okra and passion fruit seeds as a coagulant increased the biodegradability of the treated effluent the volume of dry sludge produced was 1 563 kg m ³ using okra and 0 835 kg m ³ using passion fruit seed finally flotation by dissolved air proved to be efficient for solid liquid separation in coagulation flocculation using okra and passion fruit seeds as a natural coagulant declaration of competing

13937,this study examined the treatability of a wastewater composed by industrial pesticide formulation and sanitary wastewaters using a bench scale moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr throughout 742 days and 7 operational phases tests were performed for several experimental conditions including 3 and 6 h hydraulic retention time hrt variation of the industrial effluent proportion from 2 to 8 v v utilization of various lots of the pretreated pesticide effluent or its raw form distinct responses were obtained regarding removal of chemical oxygen demand cod varying from 48 to 84 and ammoniacal nitrogen varying from 36 to 95 whereas sludge production remained always low average 0 18 kg m3 d maximum specific removal rates obtained in batch trials showed that the pretreatment of the pesticide wastewater is truly beneficial for keeping higher biofilm activities and preventing nitrification inhibition nevertheless even in the absence of pretreatment the pesticide wastewater showed high biodegradability corresponding to 65 of soluble cod for the operational conditions overall it was shown that the mbbr at hrt of 6 h and media filling ratio of 50 is a viable alternative for the secondary treatment of highly polluted pesticide wastewater even in the absence of pretreatment while preserving a biofilm with good depuration capacity diverse microfauna and volatile fraction consistently over 85 keywords mbbr pesticide wastewater biological treatment industrial wastewater 1 introduction sustainable wastewater management is hugely important for most of matters relevant to human society and environment industrial wastewaters are especially challenging as they may possess low consistency in composition due to seasonal variations inherent to the industrial processes and high pollutants concentrations with potentially toxic recalcitrant and bioaccumulative compounds one example of such substances comes from industries producing pesticides which are applied as one of the main measures for crop protection such substances are known to be harmful to human and animal health as well as to the environment posing a risk to all of them even at concentrations as low as μg l and ng l 1 4 however the use of those products is necessary for the productivity to keep along with the growing food consumption thanks to increasing world population and changes in eating habits 5 6 in the same context intensive agriculture techniques are used instead of traditional cultivation which may raise the pesticides usage up to 200 times 7 thus pesticide production and application stands as one of the main industrial activities to the present day producing approximately 150 million tons of wastewater every year 8 agricultural run off agricultural industries management of pesticide disposed containers and pesticide plants consist of the main paths through such substances reach the environment 9 pesticide industries can be classified as manufacture where the technical grade active ingredients are synthesized or formulation where the technical grade pesticides are mixed with other ingredients to make the final commercial pesticide product 10 brazil appears constantly since 1995 as the third greater user of pesticide in the world 11 out of all the pesticide used in brazil roughly 63 goes through national formulation industry 12 in which the washing of equipment and production lines is the main source of wastewater this cleaning operation is performed with water or solvent between the formulation of different products avoiding batches cross contamination as the formulated pesticide frequently changes it is clear that the residual water from the formulation process has great variability regarding composition however some pollutants groups normally found in this kind of wastewater include volatile aromatics halomethanes cyanides haloethers phenols polynuclear aromatic heavy metals chlorinated ethanes and ethylenes nitrosamines phthalates dichloropropane and dichloropropene pesticides dienes it can also contain regular pollutants as easily degradable organic matter oil ammonia and inorganic salts 10 minimizing the environmental impact of their activities by correctly treating the wastewater is an ethical and legal responsibility of pesticide industries despite the existence of a number of treatment type options for the wastewater generated by the pesticide producing industry biological processes often appear as the most cost effective choices 13 nevertheless the toxicity and high persistent organic load of this kind of waste streams are challenges for the application of biological processes consequently their association with physicochemical pretreatment steps and or the mix of the pesticide containing wastewater with sanitary sewage are common approaches used to improve the industrial wastewater biodegradability and lower toxicity in the biological stage the pesticide compounds may be biodegraded to intermediary compounds mineralized adsorbed into the sludge and or volatilized to the air 10 biological treatment processes rely on suspended and or attached growth of microbial biomass in form of biofilms in the latter case for a particular footprint attached growth processes allow greater sludge concentration than conventional activated sludge reactors as and higher solids retention time although unevenly distributed through the biofilm depth and difficult to be assessed in attached growth processes making the biomass more specialized hence biofilm reactors tend to be more resistant to fluctuations in organic load toxicity and ph and also able to degrade otherwise recalcitrant compounds 14 16 one particular biofilm technology in evidence is the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr which is intended to combine the best features of suspended and attached processes providing a robust compact and efficient wastewater treatment solution in this kind of reactor biomass grows as biofilm inside plastic carriers with density close to that of water that freely move throughout a completely mixed reactor driven by aeration for aerobic reactors or mechanical mixing anoxic anaerobic reactors there is no sludge recirculation to the biological reactor in the mbbr configuration being therefore regarded as single pass treatment process despite being a well developed technology vastly applied to industrial wastewaters few studies assess the performance of mbbr as biological treatment for pesticide wastewater 17 19 as this kind of wastewater may present great quality variations it is important to build up a more solid base of knowledge regarding the treatment of this complex matrix this implies the need for a greater number of applied researches on this topic studies focusing on pesticide wastewater treatment using different kinds of biological reactors are found in the literature 1 2 27 29 9 20 26 although the toxicity and low biodegradability of this type of wastewater have been highlighted in previous investigations so far none investigated the exposure of a biological process to increasing loads of real raw pesticide formulation wastewater in this study the biological treatment of the waste streams from a pesticide formulation industry in a mbbr has been addressed the bioreactor was evaluated in terms of organic matter removal and nitrification the robustness of the process was evaluated under different hrts diverse qualities and proportions of the industrial pesticide effluent either pretreated in the industrial site or in its raw form mixed with sanitary sewage the exposure of the bioreactor to increasing proportions of the raw pesticide wastewater is a unique feature of this study particularly considering that nitrification is seldom evaluated for pesticide wastewaters and nitrifying bacteria are inherently more sensitive to toxicity posed by a wide range of chemical compounds 2 material and methods 2 1 industrial wastewater as in any pesticide formulation plant the main source of contaminated wastewater is the washing of lines and equipment to avoid cross contamination between batches for different products the wastes of various washing operations are mixed generating a complex industrial raw pesticide wastewater ir that might contain many of the almost 150 pesticides produced by the industry including fungicides fosetyl propineb fenamidone etc insecticides flubendiamide triflumuron spiromesifen etc and herbicides ethoxysulfuron tembotrione diuron etc in the pesticide formulation site the ir is repeatedly pretreated by adsorption with powdered activated carbon pac until its soluble chemical oxygen demand scod is lower than 4000 mg l and toxicity ed50 below 25 v v complying with local directive the filtered industrial pretreated effluent ipt is then mixed with sanitary wastewater s produced in the same industrial facility in an average proportion of 4 ipt to 96 s v v currently the mixed effluent is biologically treated in a conventional activated sludge process which is planned to be substituted for a more compact and robust biological treatment as the mbbr that might show higher resilience to withstand seasonal wastewater variations samples of different lots of ir ipt and s were periodically sent to the laboratory and kept refrigerated at 4 c until being mixed according to each operational phase details are described in section 2 2 eventually ipt with cod higher than 4000 mg l was received in this case it was diluted with water to achieve cod of 3500 mg l to keep consistency with the preestablished limit table 1 shows average characteristics of each kind of wastewater a schematic diagram of the operational setup is shown in fig s1 supplementary material 2 2 moving bed biofilm reactor the bench scale mbbr consisted of a glass cylinder with 5 5 cm diameter and working volume of 300 ml the reactor was filled with 149 kaldnes k1 carriers which exhibit a protected specific surface area of 500 m² m³ 9 1 mm diameter and 7 2 mm height other characteristics of this plastic media are described elsewhere 16 that represented approximately 50 carriers filling ratio which provides good circulation of the carriers and favors the oxygen transfer within the reactor while retaining great surface availability for biofilm growth 30 a peristaltic pump watson marlow 323s was used to feed the reactor using silicon hoses coming from a large plastic container kept under refrigeration at 4 c to prevent degradation upstream the reactor sludge and some k1 carriers from another mbbr operating in the laboratory with synthetic wastewater were used to inoculate the reactor the parent mbbr was initially inoculated with activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant from rio de janeiro brazil while the real wastewater was not available the mbbr was fed for approximately 5 months with synthetic wastewater composed by 0 29 g glucose l 0 35 g nahco3 l 0 105 g nh4cl l 0 01 g mgso4 l 0 0281 g k2hpo4 l 0 0219 g kh2po4 l and 0 5 ml of trace metal solution l the latter is described elsewhere 31 the composition of the synthetic wastewater was defined in such a way to achieve similar organic and nitrogen loads as those applied to the the existing treatment facility in the pesticide industry while providing the macro and micronutrients minimum requirements for microorganisms growth 32 results of the reactor operation with the synthetic wastewater are not shown in this work as it did not intend to simulate the real wastewater table 2 details the 7 operational phases that were conducted over 742 days of operation with changes to a hydraulic retention time hrt to evaluate nitrification levels under different hydraulic conditions b industrial wastewater proportion to assess the capability of the mbbr to deal with increased loads of organic matter and pesticide compounds and c industrial wastewater quality to investigate how seasonal changes could affect the system the exact number of phases and their durations were also affected by technical issues and then could not be more homogenously distributed at first ipt wastewater was used until it was switched to ir from phase 4 onwards up to phase 2 nominal hrt was 3 h changing to nominal 6 h from phase 3 onwards to achieve nitrification average values of volumetric loading rate vlr and surface loading rate slr both calculated based on total cod are also presented in table 2 occasionally there were periods between the experimental phases with minimal monitoring of the system and no overall data collection the temperature was 21 1 c during the entire reactor operation compressed air fed from the bottom of the reactor provided mixing dissolved oxygen do and control of the biofilm thickness inside the carriers the air flow was between 3 and 4 l min and the do in the reactor was maintained above 6 mg l the ph was not adjusted up to phase 4 being therefore dependent on the characteristics of the wastewaters lots collected in the industrial site influent and effluent average ph values for each phase are presented in table 2 alkalinity adjustment was done starting at phase 5 with addition of enough sodium bicarbonate calculated for complete nitrification assuming 7 14 g caco3 g removed tan 16 2 3 batch trials to assess the maximum substrate utilization rates for scod and tan batch trials were performed at the end of each phase that was done by draining the liquid closing the reactor and then filling it with known volume of the feed wastewater correspondent to the operational phase therefore the remaining biomass in the reactor consisted only of attached solids as the suspended ones were washed out while draining the reactor volume then the mbbr was operated in batch mode for up to 7 h at 21 1 c with regular sampling at defined time intervals and immediate microfiltration of samples to prevent further microbial activity when finished the trial up to 8 carriers were removed for analysis of total attached solids tas and volatile attached solids vas as described in section 2 4 considering that the trials were performed in presence of excess substrates and oxygen the substrate removal rate tends to be constant and equal to the maximum removal rate as long as the substrate persisted in excess through the trial 33 this means that the substrate concentration decays linearly with time and the maximum removal rate can be obtained through linear regression corrections regarding the volume sampled during the trials were made when calculating the attached biomass biofilm specific maximum removal rates the statistical concept of cook s distance was calculated for each data point in the batch trials this calculation allows to estimate how much each individual data point influences the least squares regression by combining the leverage and residual values of each observation then those points with cook s distance higher than three times the average cook s distance were considered as outliers and removed from the linear regression 34 2 4 analytical methods measurement of most physicochemical parameters was conducted according to their standard methods 35 including chemical oxygen demand total ammoniacal nitrogen nitrite nitrate total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss for the determination of total attached solids tas and volatile attached solids vas concentrations the biofilm of a known number of carriers was completely scraped off with regular interdental brushes and reagent grade water then standard methods for total solids and total volatile solids were followed relating the obtained mass with the number of carriers instead of volume all quantifications that required filtered samples scod tan nitrite and nitrate were carried after filtering samples through cellulose nitrate membranes with nominal 0 45 μm pore size sartorius 11406 47 acn the removal efficiency for a certain parameter was calculated on an influent effluent basis by subtracting the outlet concentration from the inlet one and then dividing by the inlet concentration 100 efficiency is achieved when the respective parameter was not detected in the effluent a hanna instruments phmeter model hi2221 was used for ph measurement temperature was monitored by the thermocouple of the same equipment turbidity was analyzed with the policontrol ap 2000 turbidimeter optical microscopy images were taken to assess the characteristics of the biomass using the boeco germany model bm 800 microscope 3 results and discussion the mbbr inlet and outlet average tcod scod tan tss vss tss and turbidity for each experimental phase are summarized in table 3 average percentual removals in relation to inlet values are also displayed for tcod scod and tan calculated as described in section 2 4 3 1 cod removal the results of organic matter removal in terms of total soluble and particulate cod pcod for all experimental phases are presented in fig 1 text balloons indicates the change of the industrial wastewater lot used to prepare the reactor feed transitions from one phase to the following are depicted as black vertical lines and identified with p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 throughout phase 1 the total cod average removal was 83 5 with mean effluent tcod of 58 mg l presenting great variation though always below the discharge limit of 250 mg l imposed by local regulation 36 meanwhile the mean outlet scod was 34 mg l nevertheless assessment of scod is more realistic since at real scale any variations in outlet pcod could probably be managed by a solid liquid separation unit usually the secondary clarifier as the purpose of the lab scale experiment was just the evaluation of the role of the bioreactor in the overall treatment such device was not installed in the bench setup it should also be considered that the influent pcod proceeded almost in its totality from the sanitary wastewater usually of easy biodegradability great variation in the inlet pcod was observed due to constant changes in the sanitary wastewater characteristics and absence of mixing in the reactor feed tank nevertheless the mbbr could always produce an effluent with quite low amount of solids as can be seen in suspended solids and turbidity mean outlet values table 3 for comparison the mean tss content was 68 mg l during the whole period whilst pure mbbr systems treating municipal sewage tend to have effluent tss in the range 150 250 mg l 16 higher inlet solids concentrations were observed in phases 1 and 2 in average 373 and 291 mg l respectively in those cases when effluent tss concentration is analyzed with respect to the incoming solids it is seen that the microbial consortium was able to hydrolyze most of the particulate matter so that a low effluent tss was noticed averaging 84 phase 1 and 100 mg l phase 2 if the pcod is assessed for these phases fig 1a days 120 148 it is seen that the outlet scod was mostly not varying with pcod fluctuations indicating that the solids that entered the system were not only converted to soluble forms but also degraded in the beginning of phase 2 after doubling the proportion of the pretreated industrial wastewater ipt from 4 to 8 v v the reactor performance remained quite stable although for this period the cod of the sanitary wastewater was particularly low along the change of the lot of ipt ipt 0 to ipt 1 there was a period that the dilution described in section 2 1 was inadequate particularly from days 102 115 raising considerably the inlet scod therefore during this span of time the average outlet scod increased significantly from 43 mg l ipt 0 phase 2 to 201 mg l ipt 1 days 102 115 after that the average scod remained 106 mg l to the end of phase 2 as phase 3 started the hrt was adjusted from 3 to 6 h nevertheless the outlet scod with ipt 1 did not change 110 mg l suggesting that the remaining cod was not biodegraded by the existing microbial community for that hrt contact time with the waste stream this means that the hrt of 3 h was enough to achieve maximum organic matter removal for that wastewater quality theoretically there may be a critical hrt that would lead to a wastewater biomass contact time high enough for the growth and thrive of more specialized microorganisms that could further degrade the industrial compounds in this scenario the easily biodegradable matter could be degraded mainly by the suspended biomass and free living bacteria that are present in higher quantity for superior hrt if the organic load suffices 45 finally the average effluent scod when changing industrial wastewater lot to ipt 2 was lower close to 74 mg l these observations about the remaining scod show how the simple seasonal variation of the industrial wastewater can change significantly the performance of the reactor due to the existence of different fractions of persistent organic matter starting in phase 4 the industrial lot was changed to raw pesticide wastewater ir which was fed to the reactor at growing proportions from 2 to 4 v v in fig 2 it can be observed that the average outlet scod increases somewhat linearly for growing fractions of influent scod coming from the ir this points out to a crescent amount of persistent scod in the reactor effluent concurrent to the raise in ir proportion even if the reactor was operating only at low to moderate organic loading rates i e 5 15 g cod m²d 16 when relating the average scod removal with the incoming ir scod portion fig 2 both expressed in concentration units mg l a linear tendency shows that 0 65 mg l of scod is depleted for each unit increment of influent ir scod to the mbbr in other words 65 of the industrial cod is degradable by the mbbr and removals higher than that are only possible since the ir is mixed with s that is most likely more biodegradable one should notice that these inferences from the series presented in fig 2 are only possible because the sanitary part of the feed remained stable so that changes in scod removal and outlet scod can be attributed solely to increments in ir content in phases 6 and 7 the scod of the sanitary wastewater was particularly low due to its degradation during storage responding for only 8 and 4 respectively of the scod fed to the mbbr consequently it is expected that the reactor performance will be governed by the ir biodegradability level indeed the inferred 65 scod degradability of the ir is very close to the average scod percentage removal for phases 6 and 7 table 3 both 66 therefore the reactor is working at its full potential for that biomass wastewater contact time and biofilm maturity the latter might be a crucial factor for determining the biodegradability of a certain wastewater as the biomass might continuously specialize in biofilms for long times especially for heavily polluted industrial waste streams under real scale industrial scenario and long operation times it may be possible that once recalcitrant compounds could be made susceptible to biodegradation by immobilized biomass harbored in the plastic media phases 2 and 3 have shown that the ipt proportion can be pushed up from 4 to 8 v v while still respecting the legal discharge threshold of cod of 250 mg l considering efficient solids removal still environmental responsibility needs to be taken into consideration as higher proportions of industrial wastewater will mean greater fractions of non biodegradable pesticide compounds reaching water bodies the same can be said for when changing feed to raw pesticide wastewater mixture but still getting effluent within the cod limit as seen for the effluent scod from phases 4 7 it should be highlighted that pesticide substances may be harmful even in very low concentrations standing as micropollutants and their further removal by means of tertiary treatment options should be strongly considered 3 3 2 ammoniacal nitrogen removal the concentrations time series of inlet and outlet tan for all experimental phases along with their respective percentage removal are presented in fig 3 black vertical lines depict the transitions from one phase to the following and are identified as p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 the change of the industrial wastewater lot used to prepare the reactor feed is always indicated in text balloons although the hrt increase was not relevant for the cod removal the same cannot be said about the tan removal that increases concurrently to the hrt raise in phase 3 as can be seen in fig 3 b in the mbbr nitrite was present in concentrations lower than 1 mg n l most of the time whereas nitrate was quantified in concentrations that indicates tan removal by nitrification despite that quantification issues with nitrate made it difficult to state accurate values relatively speaking nitrate responded in average for more than 97 of sum of oxidized nitrogen forms i e nitrate and nitrite yet it is qualitatively safe to affirm that the main mechanism of ammonia removal was nitrification as also the feed was practically absent in nitrate and nitrite whenever analyzed for these parameters considering 12 of the biomass as nitrogen 37 and assuming that the incoming suspended solids were completely degraded in the mbbr and the outlet volatile suspended solids as produced biomass assimilation of nitrogen corresponded in average to 12 of the removed tan for phases 5 6 and 7 where the assumptions could be taken more safely as inlet suspended solids were much lower free ammonia concentration in liquid phase was estimated based on the ammonia ammonium equilibrium 32 and it represented less than 4 of tan most of the time for the prevailing operational temperature and ph thus even if the medium chemical composition ionic strength and the airflow could shift the equilibrium towards free ammonia it is plausible that ammonia volatilization had little significance in tan removal under certain conditions intermediate steps of the nitrification process may lead to n2o production that may be stripped off by the air stream going through the reactor or even oxidized by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria present in deeper zones of the biofilm where oxygen availability is rather low 38 despite being of low relevance quantitatively for the overall nitrogen balance the nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas 300 times stronger than the carbon dioxide so even low amounts emitted are important to account for 39 therefore by the end of phases 4 and 5 the off gas was sampled and analyzed for n2o content resulting respectively in 423 ppb and 180 ppb emitted that is discounting the n2o content in the atmospheric air during phases 1 and 2 the effluent tan was most of the time higher than the regional discharge limit of 5 mg n l 40 tan removal varied substantially but had low averages of 57 and 36 in phases 1 and 2 respectively it was particularly low when the scod was higher from days 99 137 averaging only 19 the reason for the low tan removal is possibly related to the competition of nitrifiers with heterotrophic organisms in the biofilm for oxygen nutrients and space due to high availability of organic matter and faster growth of heterotrophic microorganisms compared to autotrophic nitrifiers there can also be some inhibition caused by substances present in the industrial wastewater doubling the hrt in phase 3 attenuated these factors and tan removal reached almost completion 95 in average with mean effluent tan of 1 4 mg l changing the ipt 1 for ipt 2 during phase 3 had no impact on nitrification performance the average inlet tan concentration of 32 mg l is representative all along phases 4 7 regardless of the proportion of raw industrial wastewater in the influent as the tan was coming mainly from the sewage portion and it was stable through the period once the feed started being prepared with the ir the average inlet ph significantly decreased to 6 9 when compared to the average 7 9 for phases 1 3 as consequence the ph in the reactor went down to a mean value of 6 0 in phase 4 this is far from the optimal range of 7 8 5 for nitrification 16 and could justify the limited tan removal over the course of phase 4 with average 14 8 mg l outlet tan hence phase 5 presented the same 2 proportion of industrial raw wastewater but with adjustment of alkalinity by the addition of sodium bicarbonate in the proportion to guarantee the equivalent of 7 14 g caco3 g removed tan 16 the raise in nitrification performance reflects the importance of that adjustment as for phase 5 the mean removal was 91 compared to 50 in phase 4 average effluent tan was 2 7 mg l always below the discharge limit while the average of 14 8 mg l was observed in phase 4 as the ir proportion was increased from 2 to 3 v v in phase 6 the tan removal immediately dropped to 52 but it was consistently recovered through the days reaching an average of 95 in the last two operational days of phase 6 with 1 3 mg l of effluent tan increasing the non pretreated industrial load in phase 7 had again a negative impact on nitrification as the average removal went down to 69 and the effluent tan concentration increased up to 11 7 mg l not showing early signs of recovery 3 3 batch trials and biofilm assessment table 4 presents data obtained from biofilm quantification and maximum specific removal rates obtained with batch trials performed under pseudo stationary conditions at the end of each operational phase the tas was expressed in g m2 but also in g l for better comparison with the tss results for each phase table 4 also shows the average real apparent specific removal rate from operational days during which the reactor feed had the same composition as that used for each respective batch trial the restraint to those days allowed a more accurate comparison with the maximum specific removal rates results total suspended solids concentrations from those dates were also used for calculating the fraction of suspended solids within the total suspended and attached biomass fss ts the scod and tan data obtained from the batch trials for each phase used to calculate the maximum specific removal rates presented in table 4 are displayed in fig s2 the volatile attached solids concentration falls in between or above the typical range of a conventional activated sludge system 1 5 5 0 g vss l 14 offering equal or higher capacity in much lower volume with higher sludge age due to solids immobilization in the plastic media also the tas values are compatible with the typical range reported for mbbrs i e 2 8 g l 16 on the other hand the suspended solids in the reactor accounted in average for only 1 9 of the total biomass with a maximum of 5 3 in phase 3 these results are similar with those found in other studies where mbbr systems were used as biological treatment stage for industrial wastewater 17 19 41 the low contribution of the suspended sludge to the total solids in the reactor implies that the real apparent specific removal rate is mainly attributed to the attached solids activity therefore the comparison between the real apparent specific removal rate and the maximum specific removal rate is fair it should be noticed that this does not mean that the suspended biomass had a low specific removal rate in fact it could be even higher than the biofilm specific removal rate because the planktonic solids are not exposed to oxygen and substrates diffusion limitations neither the change from ipt to ir from phase 3 4 nor the increase in the ir proportion from phases 4 7 showed to cause biofilm detachment as the fss ts remained low and quite stable thus it is possible to infer that the reduction in nitrification performance was not due to biofilm loss but likely attributed to some industrial wastewater components which were present in higher concentrations when the proportion of either ipt or ir was increased in fact vas reached levels much higher than in phase 3 where the best performance in nitrification was achieved reaffirming that reductions in nitrification performance were not due to biofilm losses when assessing the amount of volatile attached solids within the total attached solids it is noticeable that except for phase 5 it was characteristic of sludges with low accumulation of inorganic material exhibiting vas tas ratio within 85 90 16 this does not mean that the influent stream is free or low in inorganic solids but implies that this particulate inert material was not accumulating in the biofilm in fact during the entire study the average vss proportion in relation to the incoming and effluent total suspended solids corresponded to 62 and 70 respectively as the fixed solids fraction remains high in the mbbr effluent it indeed suggests that the inorganic portion of solids uncapable of producing exopolymeric substances was not attaching to the biofilm but persisting in the suspended phase such observation is relevant as it shows the biofilm does not tend to lose its capacity of metabolizing pollutants due to inert material accumulation regarding the scod for all experimental phases the maximum specific removal rate exceeded 1 8 12 5 times the rate observed during normal operational conditions this is expected as the reactor is designed to provide nitrification requiring higher hrt leading to a lower organic loading rate than if only cod abatement was desired in the batch trial of phase 3 two consecutive linear trends were observed allowing two different scod removal rates to be calculated as seen in table 4 this is probably due to the depletion of the most easily biodegradable substrate fraction in the beginning of the batch test leading to a shift in the removal rate to a lower value as the experiment progressed however it is unclear why the same trend was not observed for other batch trials maximum tan specific removal rates were much closer to the real apparent ones than what is observed for the cod removal rates with a maximum difference of 2 2 times in phase 3 it makes sense that the highest ratio between maximum and apparent rates was found in those particular experimental conditions as it had the greatest nitrifying performance as displayed in table 3 and fig 3 b in the other phases the real rate was nearer to the maximum removal rate meaning that the reactor was operating closer to the edge of its nitrification capacity it is important to consider that during the batch trials the biofilm was exposed to higher industrial load in comparison to regular operation therefore substances that can possibly inhibit the metabolism of some microorganisms were present in greater concentrations in fact the batch trials carried out in phases 6 and 7 showed delayed start of ammoniacal nitrogen removal fig s2 supposition is made that the nitrification began only after the heterotrophic community depleted some inhibiting compounds to non inhibiting lower concentrations both scod and tan maximum removal rates were lower for batch trials performed with ir p4 to p7 than those obtained with ipt p1 to p3 this suggests that the pretreatment of the pesticide wastewater and the consequent decrease of the industrial organic load is truly beneficial for the biological activity in pesticide containing wastewater scenario nevertheless the absence of pretreatment did not lead to substantial changes in the biofilm quality as seen in the micrographs shown in fig 4 the selected pairs of micrographs for each experimental phase can be considered as good representatives of the overall observed biofilm quality by the end of each phase protozoa and micrometazoans were spotted in considerable quantities through microscopical observations fig 4 feeding on free living bacteria those organisms help delivering effluent with lower turbidity and particulate cod even at the highest industrial wastewater concentration in phase 7 rotifers and ciliates were still present as the eukaryotic community is susceptible to toxic effects the relative steadiness of the microfauna indicates stable and tolerable toxicity of the wastewater 42 eventual observations of the suspended sludge revealed similar characteristics to the biofilm and low amount of free living bacteria which is consistent with the high presence of microanimals and overall low turbidity of the mbbr effluent additionally there was no relevant filamentous bacteria development which along the good biomass density and size is an indication of good sludge settleability 43 44 as the reactor was exposed to the raw pesticide producing industry wastewater the biofilm accumulated the purple color characteristic of the ir lot 4 conclusions throughout 742 days the mixture of sanitary and pesticide wastewaters was shown to be efficiently treatable in a mbbr operated under hrt of 6 h even for stressed conditions removing up to 84 cod and 95 tan with ipt and 66 cod and 91 tan with ir however differences in pesticide wastewater proportion and quality impacted outlet cod and tan levels revealing the presence of persistent compounds and their adverse effects on nitrification even under mild organic loading rates effluent suspended solids and turbidity were low while microscopy observations suggested tolerable and steady toxicity as evidenced by the stable presence of micrometazoans and protozoa authors contributions this work was mainly planned executed and had its results

13937,this study examined the treatability of a wastewater composed by industrial pesticide formulation and sanitary wastewaters using a bench scale moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr throughout 742 days and 7 operational phases tests were performed for several experimental conditions including 3 and 6 h hydraulic retention time hrt variation of the industrial effluent proportion from 2 to 8 v v utilization of various lots of the pretreated pesticide effluent or its raw form distinct responses were obtained regarding removal of chemical oxygen demand cod varying from 48 to 84 and ammoniacal nitrogen varying from 36 to 95 whereas sludge production remained always low average 0 18 kg m3 d maximum specific removal rates obtained in batch trials showed that the pretreatment of the pesticide wastewater is truly beneficial for keeping higher biofilm activities and preventing nitrification inhibition nevertheless even in the absence of pretreatment the pesticide wastewater showed high biodegradability corresponding to 65 of soluble cod for the operational conditions overall it was shown that the mbbr at hrt of 6 h and media filling ratio of 50 is a viable alternative for the secondary treatment of highly polluted pesticide wastewater even in the absence of pretreatment while preserving a biofilm with good depuration capacity diverse microfauna and volatile fraction consistently over 85 keywords mbbr pesticide wastewater biological treatment industrial wastewater 1 introduction sustainable wastewater management is hugely important for most of matters relevant to human society and environment industrial wastewaters are especially challenging as they may possess low consistency in composition due to seasonal variations inherent to the industrial processes and high pollutants concentrations with potentially toxic recalcitrant and bioaccumulative compounds one example of such substances comes from industries producing pesticides which are applied as one of the main measures for crop protection such substances are known to be harmful to human and animal health as well as to the environment posing a risk to all of them even at concentrations as low as μg l and ng l 1 4 however the use of those products is necessary for the productivity to keep along with the growing food consumption thanks to increasing world population and changes in eating habits 5 6 in the same context intensive agriculture techniques are used instead of traditional cultivation which may raise the pesticides usage up to 200 times 7 thus pesticide production and application stands as one of the main industrial activities to the present day producing approximately 150 million tons of wastewater every year 8 agricultural run off agricultural industries management of pesticide disposed containers and pesticide plants consist of the main paths through such substances reach the environment 9 pesticide industries can be classified as manufacture where the technical grade active ingredients are synthesized or formulation where the technical grade pesticides are mixed with other ingredients to make the final commercial pesticide product 10 brazil appears constantly since 1995 as the third greater user of pesticide in the world 11 out of all the pesticide used in brazil roughly 63 goes through national formulation industry 12 in which the washing of equipment and production lines is the main source of wastewater this cleaning operation is performed with water or solvent between the formulation of different products avoiding batches cross contamination as the formulated pesticide frequently changes it is clear that the residual water from the formulation process has great variability regarding composition however some pollutants groups normally found in this kind of wastewater include volatile aromatics halomethanes cyanides haloethers phenols polynuclear aromatic heavy metals chlorinated ethanes and ethylenes nitrosamines phthalates dichloropropane and dichloropropene pesticides dienes it can also contain regular pollutants as easily degradable organic matter oil ammonia and inorganic salts 10 minimizing the environmental impact of their activities by correctly treating the wastewater is an ethical and legal responsibility of pesticide industries despite the existence of a number of treatment type options for the wastewater generated by the pesticide producing industry biological processes often appear as the most cost effective choices 13 nevertheless the toxicity and high persistent organic load of this kind of waste streams are challenges for the application of biological processes consequently their association with physicochemical pretreatment steps and or the mix of the pesticide containing wastewater with sanitary sewage are common approaches used to improve the industrial wastewater biodegradability and lower toxicity in the biological stage the pesticide compounds may be biodegraded to intermediary compounds mineralized adsorbed into the sludge and or volatilized to the air 10 biological treatment processes rely on suspended and or attached growth of microbial biomass in form of biofilms in the latter case for a particular footprint attached growth processes allow greater sludge concentration than conventional activated sludge reactors as and higher solids retention time although unevenly distributed through the biofilm depth and difficult to be assessed in attached growth processes making the biomass more specialized hence biofilm reactors tend to be more resistant to fluctuations in organic load toxicity and ph and also able to degrade otherwise recalcitrant compounds 14 16 one particular biofilm technology in evidence is the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr which is intended to combine the best features of suspended and attached processes providing a robust compact and efficient wastewater treatment solution in this kind of reactor biomass grows as biofilm inside plastic carriers with density close to that of water that freely move throughout a completely mixed reactor driven by aeration for aerobic reactors or mechanical mixing anoxic anaerobic reactors there is no sludge recirculation to the biological reactor in the mbbr configuration being therefore regarded as single pass treatment process despite being a well developed technology vastly applied to industrial wastewaters few studies assess the performance of mbbr as biological treatment for pesticide wastewater 17 19 as this kind of wastewater may present great quality variations it is important to build up a more solid base of knowledge regarding the treatment of this complex matrix this implies the need for a greater number of applied researches on this topic studies focusing on pesticide wastewater treatment using different kinds of biological reactors are found in the literature 1 2 27 29 9 20 26 although the toxicity and low biodegradability of this type of wastewater have been highlighted in previous investigations so far none investigated the exposure of a biological process to increasing loads of real raw pesticide formulation wastewater in this study the biological treatment of the waste streams from a pesticide formulation industry in a mbbr has been addressed the bioreactor was evaluated in terms of organic matter removal and nitrification the robustness of the process was evaluated under different hrts diverse qualities and proportions of the industrial pesticide effluent either pretreated in the industrial site or in its raw form mixed with sanitary sewage the exposure of the bioreactor to increasing proportions of the raw pesticide wastewater is a unique feature of this study particularly considering that nitrification is seldom evaluated for pesticide wastewaters and nitrifying bacteria are inherently more sensitive to toxicity posed by a wide range of chemical compounds 2 material and methods 2 1 industrial wastewater as in any pesticide formulation plant the main source of contaminated wastewater is the washing of lines and equipment to avoid cross contamination between batches for different products the wastes of various washing operations are mixed generating a complex industrial raw pesticide wastewater ir that might contain many of the almost 150 pesticides produced by the industry including fungicides fosetyl propineb fenamidone etc insecticides flubendiamide triflumuron spiromesifen etc and herbicides ethoxysulfuron tembotrione diuron etc in the pesticide formulation site the ir is repeatedly pretreated by adsorption with powdered activated carbon pac until its soluble chemical oxygen demand scod is lower than 4000 mg l and toxicity ed50 below 25 v v complying with local directive the filtered industrial pretreated effluent ipt is then mixed with sanitary wastewater s produced in the same industrial facility in an average proportion of 4 ipt to 96 s v v currently the mixed effluent is biologically treated in a conventional activated sludge process which is planned to be substituted for a more compact and robust biological treatment as the mbbr that might show higher resilience to withstand seasonal wastewater variations samples of different lots of ir ipt and s were periodically sent to the laboratory and kept refrigerated at 4 c until being mixed according to each operational phase details are described in section 2 2 eventually ipt with cod higher than 4000 mg l was received in this case it was diluted with water to achieve cod of 3500 mg l to keep consistency with the preestablished limit table 1 shows average characteristics of each kind of wastewater a schematic diagram of the operational setup is shown in fig s1 supplementary material 2 2 moving bed biofilm reactor the bench scale mbbr consisted of a glass cylinder with 5 5 cm diameter and working volume of 300 ml the reactor was filled with 149 kaldnes k1 carriers which exhibit a protected specific surface area of 500 m² m³ 9 1 mm diameter and 7 2 mm height other characteristics of this plastic media are described elsewhere 16 that represented approximately 50 carriers filling ratio which provides good circulation of the carriers and favors the oxygen transfer within the reactor while retaining great surface availability for biofilm growth 30 a peristaltic pump watson marlow 323s was used to feed the reactor using silicon hoses coming from a large plastic container kept under refrigeration at 4 c to prevent degradation upstream the reactor sludge and some k1 carriers from another mbbr operating in the laboratory with synthetic wastewater were used to inoculate the reactor the parent mbbr was initially inoculated with activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant from rio de janeiro brazil while the real wastewater was not available the mbbr was fed for approximately 5 months with synthetic wastewater composed by 0 29 g glucose l 0 35 g nahco3 l 0 105 g nh4cl l 0 01 g mgso4 l 0 0281 g k2hpo4 l 0 0219 g kh2po4 l and 0 5 ml of trace metal solution l the latter is described elsewhere 31 the composition of the synthetic wastewater was defined in such a way to achieve similar organic and nitrogen loads as those applied to the the existing treatment facility in the pesticide industry while providing the macro and micronutrients minimum requirements for microorganisms growth 32 results of the reactor operation with the synthetic wastewater are not shown in this work as it did not intend to simulate the real wastewater table 2 details the 7 operational phases that were conducted over 742 days of operation with changes to a hydraulic retention time hrt to evaluate nitrification levels under different hydraulic conditions b industrial wastewater proportion to assess the capability of the mbbr to deal with increased loads of organic matter and pesticide compounds and c industrial wastewater quality to investigate how seasonal changes could affect the system the exact number of phases and their durations were also affected by technical issues and then could not be more homogenously distributed at first ipt wastewater was used until it was switched to ir from phase 4 onwards up to phase 2 nominal hrt was 3 h changing to nominal 6 h from phase 3 onwards to achieve nitrification average values of volumetric loading rate vlr and surface loading rate slr both calculated based on total cod are also presented in table 2 occasionally there were periods between the experimental phases with minimal monitoring of the system and no overall data collection the temperature was 21 1 c during the entire reactor operation compressed air fed from the bottom of the reactor provided mixing dissolved oxygen do and control of the biofilm thickness inside the carriers the air flow was between 3 and 4 l min and the do in the reactor was maintained above 6 mg l the ph was not adjusted up to phase 4 being therefore dependent on the characteristics of the wastewaters lots collected in the industrial site influent and effluent average ph values for each phase are presented in table 2 alkalinity adjustment was done starting at phase 5 with addition of enough sodium bicarbonate calculated for complete nitrification assuming 7 14 g caco3 g removed tan 16 2 3 batch trials to assess the maximum substrate utilization rates for scod and tan batch trials were performed at the end of each phase that was done by draining the liquid closing the reactor and then filling it with known volume of the feed wastewater correspondent to the operational phase therefore the remaining biomass in the reactor consisted only of attached solids as the suspended ones were washed out while draining the reactor volume then the mbbr was operated in batch mode for up to 7 h at 21 1 c with regular sampling at defined time intervals and immediate microfiltration of samples to prevent further microbial activity when finished the trial up to 8 carriers were removed for analysis of total attached solids tas and volatile attached solids vas as described in section 2 4 considering that the trials were performed in presence of excess substrates and oxygen the substrate removal rate tends to be constant and equal to the maximum removal rate as long as the substrate persisted in excess through the trial 33 this means that the substrate concentration decays linearly with time and the maximum removal rate can be obtained through linear regression corrections regarding the volume sampled during the trials were made when calculating the attached biomass biofilm specific maximum removal rates the statistical concept of cook s distance was calculated for each data point in the batch trials this calculation allows to estimate how much each individual data point influences the least squares regression by combining the leverage and residual values of each observation then those points with cook s distance higher than three times the average cook s distance were considered as outliers and removed from the linear regression 34 2 4 analytical methods measurement of most physicochemical parameters was conducted according to their standard methods 35 including chemical oxygen demand total ammoniacal nitrogen nitrite nitrate total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss for the determination of total attached solids tas and volatile attached solids vas concentrations the biofilm of a known number of carriers was completely scraped off with regular interdental brushes and reagent grade water then standard methods for total solids and total volatile solids were followed relating the obtained mass with the number of carriers instead of volume all quantifications that required filtered samples scod tan nitrite and nitrate were carried after filtering samples through cellulose nitrate membranes with nominal 0 45 μm pore size sartorius 11406 47 acn the removal efficiency for a certain parameter was calculated on an influent effluent basis by subtracting the outlet concentration from the inlet one and then dividing by the inlet concentration 100 efficiency is achieved when the respective parameter was not detected in the effluent a hanna instruments phmeter model hi2221 was used for ph measurement temperature was monitored by the thermocouple of the same equipment turbidity was analyzed with the policontrol ap 2000 turbidimeter optical microscopy images were taken to assess the characteristics of the biomass using the boeco germany model bm 800 microscope 3 results and discussion the mbbr inlet and outlet average tcod scod tan tss vss tss and turbidity for each experimental phase are summarized in table 3 average percentual removals in relation to inlet values are also displayed for tcod scod and tan calculated as described in section 2 4 3 1 cod removal the results of organic matter removal in terms of total soluble and particulate cod pcod for all experimental phases are presented in fig 1 text balloons indicates the change of the industrial wastewater lot used to prepare the reactor feed transitions from one phase to the following are depicted as black vertical lines and identified with p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 throughout phase 1 the total cod average removal was 83 5 with mean effluent tcod of 58 mg l presenting great variation though always below the discharge limit of 250 mg l imposed by local regulation 36 meanwhile the mean outlet scod was 34 mg l nevertheless assessment of scod is more realistic since at real scale any variations in outlet pcod could probably be managed by a solid liquid separation unit usually the secondary clarifier as the purpose of the lab scale experiment was just the evaluation of the role of the bioreactor in the overall treatment such device was not installed in the bench setup it should also be considered that the influent pcod proceeded almost in its totality from the sanitary wastewater usually of easy biodegradability great variation in the inlet pcod was observed due to constant changes in the sanitary wastewater characteristics and absence of mixing in the reactor feed tank nevertheless the mbbr could always produce an effluent with quite low amount of solids as can be seen in suspended solids and turbidity mean outlet values table 3 for comparison the mean tss content was 68 mg l during the whole period whilst pure mbbr systems treating municipal sewage tend to have effluent tss in the range 150 250 mg l 16 higher inlet solids concentrations were observed in phases 1 and 2 in average 373 and 291 mg l respectively in those cases when effluent tss concentration is analyzed with respect to the incoming solids it is seen that the microbial consortium was able to hydrolyze most of the particulate matter so that a low effluent tss was noticed averaging 84 phase 1 and 100 mg l phase 2 if the pcod is assessed for these phases fig 1a days 120 148 it is seen that the outlet scod was mostly not varying with pcod fluctuations indicating that the solids that entered the system were not only converted to soluble forms but also degraded in the beginning of phase 2 after doubling the proportion of the pretreated industrial wastewater ipt from 4 to 8 v v the reactor performance remained quite stable although for this period the cod of the sanitary wastewater was particularly low along the change of the lot of ipt ipt 0 to ipt 1 there was a period that the dilution described in section 2 1 was inadequate particularly from days 102 115 raising considerably the inlet scod therefore during this span of time the average outlet scod increased significantly from 43 mg l ipt 0 phase 2 to 201 mg l ipt 1 days 102 115 after that the average scod remained 106 mg l to the end of phase 2 as phase 3 started the hrt was adjusted from 3 to 6 h nevertheless the outlet scod with ipt 1 did not change 110 mg l suggesting that the remaining cod was not biodegraded by the existing microbial community for that hrt contact time with the waste stream this means that the hrt of 3 h was enough to achieve maximum organic matter removal for that wastewater quality theoretically there may be a critical hrt that would lead to a wastewater biomass contact time high enough for the growth and thrive of more specialized microorganisms that could further degrade the industrial compounds in this scenario the easily biodegradable matter could be degraded mainly by the suspended biomass and free living bacteria that are present in higher quantity for superior hrt if the organic load suffices 45 finally the average effluent scod when changing industrial wastewater lot to ipt 2 was lower close to 74 mg l these observations about the remaining scod show how the simple seasonal variation of the industrial wastewater can change significantly the performance of the reactor due to the existence of different fractions of persistent organic matter starting in phase 4 the industrial lot was changed to raw pesticide wastewater ir which was fed to the reactor at growing proportions from 2 to 4 v v in fig 2 it can be observed that the average outlet scod increases somewhat linearly for growing fractions of influent scod coming from the ir this points out to a crescent amount of persistent scod in the reactor effluent concurrent to the raise in ir proportion even if the reactor was operating only at low to moderate organic loading rates i e 5 15 g cod m²d 16 when relating the average scod removal with the incoming ir scod portion fig 2 both expressed in concentration units mg l a linear tendency shows that 0 65 mg l of scod is depleted for each unit increment of influent ir scod to the mbbr in other words 65 of the industrial cod is degradable by the mbbr and removals higher than that are only possible since the ir is mixed with s that is most likely more biodegradable one should notice that these inferences from the series presented in fig 2 are only possible because the sanitary part of the feed remained stable so that changes in scod removal and outlet scod can be attributed solely to increments in ir content in phases 6 and 7 the scod of the sanitary wastewater was particularly low due to its degradation during storage responding for only 8 and 4 respectively of the scod fed to the mbbr consequently it is expected that the reactor performance will be governed by the ir biodegradability level indeed the inferred 65 scod degradability of the ir is very close to the average scod percentage removal for phases 6 and 7 table 3 both 66 therefore the reactor is working at its full potential for that biomass wastewater contact time and biofilm maturity the latter might be a crucial factor for determining the biodegradability of a certain wastewater as the biomass might continuously specialize in biofilms for long times especially for heavily polluted industrial waste streams under real scale industrial scenario and long operation times it may be possible that once recalcitrant compounds could be made susceptible to biodegradation by immobilized biomass harbored in the plastic media phases 2 and 3 have shown that the ipt proportion can be pushed up from 4 to 8 v v while still respecting the legal discharge threshold of cod of 250 mg l considering efficient solids removal still environmental responsibility needs to be taken into consideration as higher proportions of industrial wastewater will mean greater fractions of non biodegradable pesticide compounds reaching water bodies the same can be said for when changing feed to raw pesticide wastewater mixture but still getting effluent within the cod limit as seen for the effluent scod from phases 4 7 it should be highlighted that pesticide substances may be harmful even in very low concentrations standing as micropollutants and their further removal by means of tertiary treatment options should be strongly considered 3 3 2 ammoniacal nitrogen removal the concentrations time series of inlet and outlet tan for all experimental phases along with their respective percentage removal are presented in fig 3 black vertical lines depict the transitions from one phase to the following and are identified as p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 the change of the industrial wastewater lot used to prepare the reactor feed is always indicated in text balloons although the hrt increase was not relevant for the cod removal the same cannot be said about the tan removal that increases concurrently to the hrt raise in phase 3 as can be seen in fig 3 b in the mbbr nitrite was present in concentrations lower than 1 mg n l most of the time whereas nitrate was quantified in concentrations that indicates tan removal by nitrification despite that quantification issues with nitrate made it difficult to state accurate values relatively speaking nitrate responded in average for more than 97 of sum of oxidized nitrogen forms i e nitrate and nitrite yet it is qualitatively safe to affirm that the main mechanism of ammonia removal was nitrification as also the feed was practically absent in nitrate and nitrite whenever analyzed for these parameters considering 12 of the biomass as nitrogen 37 and assuming that the incoming suspended solids were completely degraded in the mbbr and the outlet volatile suspended solids as produced biomass assimilation of nitrogen corresponded in average to 12 of the removed tan for phases 5 6 and 7 where the assumptions could be taken more safely as inlet suspended solids were much lower free ammonia concentration in liquid phase was estimated based on the ammonia ammonium equilibrium 32 and it represented less than 4 of tan most of the time for the prevailing operational temperature and ph thus even if the medium chemical composition ionic strength and the airflow could shift the equilibrium towards free ammonia it is plausible that ammonia volatilization had little significance in tan removal under certain conditions intermediate steps of the nitrification process may lead to n2o production that may be stripped off by the air stream going through the reactor or even oxidized by heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria present in deeper zones of the biofilm where oxygen availability is rather low 38 despite being of low relevance quantitatively for the overall nitrogen balance the nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas 300 times stronger than the carbon dioxide so even low amounts emitted are important to account for 39 therefore by the end of phases 4 and 5 the off gas was sampled and analyzed for n2o content resulting respectively in 423 ppb and 180 ppb emitted that is discounting the n2o content in the atmospheric air during phases 1 and 2 the effluent tan was most of the time higher than the regional discharge limit of 5 mg n l 40 tan removal varied substantially but had low averages of 57 and 36 in phases 1 and 2 respectively it was particularly low when the scod was higher from days 99 137 averaging only 19 the reason for the low tan removal is possibly related to the competition of nitrifiers with heterotrophic organisms in the biofilm for oxygen nutrients and space due to high availability of organic matter and faster growth of heterotrophic microorganisms compared to autotrophic nitrifiers there can also be some inhibition caused by substances present in the industrial wastewater doubling the hrt in phase 3 attenuated these factors and tan removal reached almost completion 95 in average with mean effluent tan of 1 4 mg l changing the ipt 1 for ipt 2 during phase 3 had no impact on nitrification performance the average inlet tan concentration of 32 mg l is representative all along phases 4 7 regardless of the proportion of raw industrial wastewater in the influent as the tan was coming mainly from the sewage portion and it was stable through the period once the feed started being prepared with the ir the average inlet ph significantly decreased to 6 9 when compared to the average 7 9 for phases 1 3 as consequence the ph in the reactor went down to a mean value of 6 0 in phase 4 this is far from the optimal range of 7 8 5 for nitrification 16 and could justify the limited tan removal over the course of phase 4 with average 14 8 mg l outlet tan hence phase 5 presented the same 2 proportion of industrial raw wastewater but with adjustment of alkalinity by the addition of sodium bicarbonate in the proportion to guarantee the equivalent of 7 14 g caco3 g removed tan 16 the raise in nitrification performance reflects the importance of that adjustment as for phase 5 the mean removal was 91 compared to 50 in phase 4 average effluent tan was 2 7 mg l always below the discharge limit while the average of 14 8 mg l was observed in phase 4 as the ir proportion was increased from 2 to 3 v v in phase 6 the tan removal immediately dropped to 52 but it was consistently recovered through the days reaching an average of 95 in the last two operational days of phase 6 with 1 3 mg l of effluent tan increasing the non pretreated industrial load in phase 7 had again a negative impact on nitrification as the average removal went down to 69 and the effluent tan concentration increased up to 11 7 mg l not showing early signs of recovery 3 3 batch trials and biofilm assessment table 4 presents data obtained from biofilm quantification and maximum specific removal rates obtained with batch trials performed under pseudo stationary conditions at the end of each operational phase the tas was expressed in g m2 but also in g l for better comparison with the tss results for each phase table 4 also shows the average real apparent specific removal rate from operational days during which the reactor feed had the same composition as that used for each respective batch trial the restraint to those days allowed a more accurate comparison with the maximum specific removal rates results total suspended solids concentrations from those dates were also used for calculating the fraction of suspended solids within the total suspended and attached biomass fss ts the scod and tan data obtained from the batch trials for each phase used to calculate the maximum specific removal rates presented in table 4 are displayed in fig s2 the volatile attached solids concentration falls in between or above the typical range of a conventional activated sludge system 1 5 5 0 g vss l 14 offering equal or higher capacity in much lower volume with higher sludge age due to solids immobilization in the plastic media also the tas values are compatible with the typical range reported for mbbrs i e 2 8 g l 16 on the other hand the suspended solids in the reactor accounted in average for only 1 9 of the total biomass with a maximum of 5 3 in phase 3 these results are similar with those found in other studies where mbbr systems were used as biological treatment stage for industrial wastewater 17 19 41 the low contribution of the suspended sludge to the total solids in the reactor implies that the real apparent specific removal rate is mainly attributed to the attached solids activity therefore the comparison between the real apparent specific removal rate and the maximum specific removal rate is fair it should be noticed that this does not mean that the suspended biomass had a low specific removal rate in fact it could be even higher than the biofilm specific removal rate because the planktonic solids are not exposed to oxygen and substrates diffusion limitations neither the change from ipt to ir from phase 3 4 nor the increase in the ir proportion from phases 4 7 showed to cause biofilm detachment as the fss ts remained low and quite stable thus it is possible to infer that the reduction in nitrification performance was not due to biofilm loss but likely attributed to some industrial wastewater components which were present in higher concentrations when the proportion of either ipt or ir was increased in fact vas reached levels much higher than in phase 3 where the best performance in nitrification was achieved reaffirming that reductions in nitrification performance were not due to biofilm losses when assessing the amount of volatile attached solids within the total attached solids it is noticeable that except for phase 5 it was characteristic of sludges with low accumulation of inorganic material exhibiting vas tas ratio within 85 90 16 this does not mean that the influent stream is free or low in inorganic solids but implies that this particulate inert material was not accumulating in the biofilm in fact during the entire study the average vss proportion in relation to the incoming and effluent total suspended solids corresponded to 62 and 70 respectively as the fixed solids fraction remains high in the mbbr effluent it indeed suggests that the inorganic portion of solids uncapable of producing exopolymeric substances was not attaching to the biofilm but persisting in the suspended phase such observation is relevant as it shows the biofilm does not tend to lose its capacity of metabolizing pollutants due to inert material accumulation regarding the scod for all experimental phases the maximum specific removal rate exceeded 1 8 12 5 times the rate observed during normal operational conditions this is expected as the reactor is designed to provide nitrification requiring higher hrt leading to a lower organic loading rate than if only cod abatement was desired in the batch trial of phase 3 two consecutive linear trends were observed allowing two different scod removal rates to be calculated as seen in table 4 this is probably due to the depletion of the most easily biodegradable substrate fraction in the beginning of the batch test leading to a shift in the removal rate to a lower value as the experiment progressed however it is unclear why the same trend was not observed for other batch trials maximum tan specific removal rates were much closer to the real apparent ones than what is observed for the cod removal rates with a maximum difference of 2 2 times in phase 3 it makes sense that the highest ratio between maximum and apparent rates was found in those particular experimental conditions as it had the greatest nitrifying performance as displayed in table 3 and fig 3 b in the other phases the real rate was nearer to the maximum removal rate meaning that the reactor was operating closer to the edge of its nitrification capacity it is important to consider that during the batch trials the biofilm was exposed to higher industrial load in comparison to regular operation therefore substances that can possibly inhibit the metabolism of some microorganisms were present in greater concentrations in fact the batch trials carried out in phases 6 and 7 showed delayed start of ammoniacal nitrogen removal fig s2 supposition is made that the nitrification began only after the heterotrophic community depleted some inhibiting compounds to non inhibiting lower concentrations both scod and tan maximum removal rates were lower for batch trials performed with ir p4 to p7 than those obtained with ipt p1 to p3 this suggests that the pretreatment of the pesticide wastewater and the consequent decrease of the industrial organic load is truly beneficial for the biological activity in pesticide containing wastewater scenario nevertheless the absence of pretreatment did not lead to substantial changes in the biofilm quality as seen in the micrographs shown in fig 4 the selected pairs of micrographs for each experimental phase can be considered as good representatives of the overall observed biofilm quality by the end of each phase protozoa and micrometazoans were spotted in considerable quantities through microscopical observations fig 4 feeding on free living bacteria those organisms help delivering effluent with lower turbidity and particulate cod even at the highest industrial wastewater concentration in phase 7 rotifers and ciliates were still present as the eukaryotic community is susceptible to toxic effects the relative steadiness of the microfauna indicates stable and tolerable toxicity of the wastewater 42 eventual observations of the suspended sludge revealed similar characteristics to the biofilm and low amount of free living bacteria which is consistent with the high presence of microanimals and overall low turbidity of the mbbr effluent additionally there was no relevant filamentous bacteria development which along the good biomass density and size is an indication of good sludge settleability 43 44 as the reactor was exposed to the raw pesticide producing industry wastewater the biofilm accumulated the purple color characteristic of the ir lot 4 conclusions throughout 742 days the mixture of sanitary and pesticide wastewaters was shown to be efficiently treatable in a mbbr operated under hrt of 6 h even for stressed conditions removing up to 84 cod and 95 tan with ipt and 66 cod and 91 tan with ir however differences in pesticide wastewater proportion and quality impacted outlet cod and tan levels revealing the presence of persistent compounds and their adverse effects on nitrification even under mild organic loading rates effluent suspended solids and turbidity were low while microscopy observations suggested tolerable and steady toxicity as evidenced by the stable presence of micrometazoans and protozoa authors contributions this work was mainly planned executed and had its results

the local underground water which is slightly brackish and nitrated was treated by nanofiltration using a hybrid renewable energy system photovoltaic and wind just before the distribution an electrochemical disinfection setup was used to disinfect the nanofiltered water in the first part of this work the feasibility of the processes combination nanofiltration electrochemical water disinfection step is verified by assessing the main factors which have determined the electrolysis performance volumetric flow rate temperature chloride concentration energy this part of the study is carried out during two years of operation from april 2014 to february 2016 the second part focused mainly on the optimization of a new membrane treatment plant the purpose of this installation is

photovoltaic and wind on other hand this installation will be more attractive by blending raw water with the nanofiltered water in order to increase the performances of the plant hydraulically energetically and to correct the chloride concentration for safe disinfection of water hence the produced water by the new installation process bypass blending is totally mineral for human consumption and slightly corrosive for pipes and equipments keywords electrochemical disinfection electrolysis nanofiltration desalination plant 1 introduction due to the insufficient management of water resources in urban and rural areas in many regions of the world millions of people are exposed every day to unsafe levels of microbiological and chemical pollutants in their drinking water 1 2 almost 1 billion people lack access to an improved supply of safe drinking water diarrhoeal disease alone attributed to unsafe water sanitation and hygiene cause 2 million annual deaths mostly concentrated on children in developing countries 3 the world health organization 3 estimates that 94 of diarrhoeal cases are preventable through modifications to the environment including interventions to increase the availability of clean water and to improve sanitation and hygiene the need to disinfect drinking water has encouraged both scientists and engineers to develop new and cost effective methods for effective water disinfection these methods may be divided between chemical and physical processes in chemical processes disinfecting substances such as ozone chlorine and sodium chloride or chlorine dioxide are added to treat water a frequent drawback of the chemical processes is unwanted side reactions of the disinfectants with substances present in the water that lead to byproducts some of which are considered dangerous 4 in physical processes such as uv irradiation membrane separation and thermal disinfection is associated with high cost and maintenance efforts and does not fulfill the requirements for primary and residual water disinfection 5 7 in the last few decades alternative systems to conventional disinfection methods were developed the most promising ones are based on the in situ electrogeneration of disinfection agents 4 6 8 these technologies are environmentally friendly economically and operationally competitive they are also applicable to a wide range of microbiological contaminations in water 1 9 as compared with other disinfection methods the advantages of the electrochemical water disinfection are obvious no transport no storage less maintenance and the dosage of disinfectants is not required also the disinfecting effect can be adjusted according to the on site demand 9 12 moreover electrochemical disinfection process has shown its feasibility for many types of water such as solute containing water drinking water industrial water and seawater its effectiveness mainly depends on the chloride concentration in the water to be disinfected especially waters with high chloride content seawater for example but for waters with low chloride concentration the method was not clear and not productively in terms of free chlorine other studies show that even for low chloride concentrations less than 100 mg l the method is applicable and feasible to disinfect water 13 19 also other factors can influence the performances of an electrochemical disinfection system among them electrode potential current density current distribution mass transport regime cell design electrode materials and electrolysis medium conductivity ph and temperature 20 besides photovoltaic power supply makes possible to use electrochemical water disinfection far from the electrical supply grid and an important solution for the production of drinking water in rural areas in developing countries 21 in 2014 the first nitrate removal plant using nanofiltration nf coupled with an electrochemical disinfection system supplied with renewable energies photovoltaic and wind energies was realized at al annouar high school of sidi taibi kenitra morocco 22 the plant production of 500 l h has been designed based on the ratio of 3 l day consumer to supply 1200 students and school staff with potable water the raw water slightly brackish with high nitrate concentration was treated by nanofiltration using a hybrid renewable energy system photovoltaic and wind the produced water was then disinfected by an electrochemical technique in this context to the best of our knowledge no research works have reported the study and the optimization of the three combination process nanofiltration electrochemical water disinfection renewable energies and also the application of these technologies for drinking water production therefore in the first part of this work the feasibility of the processes combination nanofiltration electrochemical water disinfection step renewable energies is verified by assessing the main factors which have determined the electrolysis performance volumetric flow rate temperature chloride concentration energy this part of the study is carried out during two years of operation from april 2014 to february 2016 the second part focused mainly on the optimization of a new membrane treatment plant the purpose of this installation is twofold firstly the objective was to correct the concentration of chloride ions at the inlet of electrolysis secondly it was meant to avoid the quality deterioration of the produced water nitrates in particular 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant description the sidi taibi plant project was emerged from the collaboration between belectric comodos and firmus the plant marked the beginning of the use of a hybrid energy system photovoltaic and wind feeding a nanofiltration desalination unit with electrical energy it was launched in march 2013 at al annouar high school in sidi taibi kenitra morocco and designed to supply the 1200 students of the school with potable water with a daily production capacity of 12 m3 day at a pressure of 5 bar a recovery rate of 75 the membrane is fed by underground brackish water where nitrate content exceeds slightly the recommended range 22 23 the feed water is pumped into the pilot plant through intake pipes firstly underground water goes to the pre treatment compartment it is composed of two cartridges 25 μm and 5 μm connected in series the first one allows the removal of sludge which may be present in the wellbore it identifies the size of particles less than 25 μm and the second one allows the removal of fine particles greater than 5 μm secondly the pre treated water is directed into the nanofiltration compartment which consists of two spiral membranes nf90 40 40 type polyamide thin film composite filmtec dow installed in series with a total surface area of 15 2 m² table1 thirdly the nanofiltrated water is routed to be disinfected by an electrochemical disinfection system called sunpur developed by belectric company for the in situ generation of chlorine it is operated only with electrical energy and does not require any additives for the local production of drinking water and the chloride content in water is oxidized to free chlorine by an electrochemical reaction in the final step the produced water is stored in a storage tank and distributed table 2 gives the operating characteristics of the sunpur water treatment plant used and fig 1 shows the operating scheme of the sidi taibi desalination plant 2 2 characteristics of the feed water permeate and rejection of ions by nanofiltration membrane the mainly characteristics of the feed water permeate and rejection in table 3 2 3 experimental methods and analyses the sidi taibi desalination plant fig

in the solution respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanofiltration combined to electrochemical disinfection process evaluation 3 1 1 nanofiltration effect on the electrodes of the electrolysis cell nanofiltration allows to prevent the formation of calcareous deposits caco3 and mg oh 2 at the cathode surface by extracting 92 6 of calcium and 96 3 of magnesium ions present in the feed water underground water table 3 this could be explained by the fact that nanofiltration membrane has a high rejection of charged particles especially bivalent ions making this technology suitable to remove hardness and a wide range of other components in one step 22 29 this behavior acts positively on the electrodes of the electrolysis cell by maintaining constantly their polarities and their activities in terms of chlorine production 14 15 many studies reported that the electrolysis of a water containing high levels of calcium and magnesium ions leads directly to the formation of calcareous deposits on the cathode surface for this a regular reversal of electrode polarity is necessary to remove these deposits unfortunately this method guides to a shortening of the electrode lifetime and a reduction in the active chlorine production 18 30 3 1 2 volumetric flow rate the operating characteristics of the sunpur system table 2 indicate that more than 400 l h of water can safely been disinfected this value is recommended because of the mass transfer mechanisms involved in the electrolysis cell and their effect on the active chlorine production rate when there is enough supporting electrolyte the migration of electroactive species is minimal and the primary mass transport mechanisms are diffusion and convection 20 moreover several researchers have studied the influence of the flow rate on the active chlorine production for different current densities by using different electrodes and they reported that the flow rate has a little influence on the active chlorine production rate whatever the current density applied and the electrode used 14 31 32 according to the obtained results from fig 2 one clearly sees that the evolution curve of permeate over time is divided into five different zones a b c d e in the beginning permeate flow rate is almost stable around 400 l h zone a this stability is mainly influenced by the compatible execution of the operating parameters of nanofiltration membrane the pressure 5 bar and the recovery rate 75 and by respecting the operating characteristics of the membranes used table 1 after almost 9 months of operation a slight decrease in permeate flow rate is observed due to the beginning of fouling 33 b consequently an increase in feed water pressure is operated to ensure a constant permeate flow for a daily needs of potable water zone c this improvement in permeate flow rate is accompanied by an enhancement of fouling d 34 in addition the improved hydraulic performance of the plant occurs immediately after cleaning the fouled membranes zone e hence except the fouling period the membrane has a steady behavior in terms of permeate flow over two years of operation it is stable in the range of 450 l h higher than 400 l h which is quite acceptable for safe disinfection of water by sunpur system 3 1 3 temperature the temperature of the water produced by nanofiltration varies between 293 15 k and 298 15 k throughout the study period fig 3 indeed the production of active chlorine depends generally on the temperature of the disinfected water as the temperature of the water increases the chlorine is consumed more quickly 14 furthermore khelifa et al 35 studied the effect of the temperature on the production of hypochlorite ion clo using a ti ruo2 anode at ph high than 8 and reported a steady production of clo between 283 15 k and 313 15 k and a slight decrease beyond 313 15 k the same results are found by hsu et al 31 for this reason sunpur system requires a water temperature between 277 15 and 298 15 k hence the temperature of the water produced is ideal for safe disinfection by sunpur system 3 1 4 energy storage during the study period the energy storage curve of the sidi taibi plant fig 4 shows that the batteries have enough power min 72 and max 95 for the nanofiltration and the electrochemical disinfection sunpur consumption request this also ensures water disinfection whatever the weather rain heat wind 3 1 5 chloride concentration a recent study shows that from a chloride concentration higher than 7 5 mg l the production of chlorine is remarkable during the electrolysis and below this concentration no chlorine is detected because chlorine could be formed but reduced in consecutive reactions 17 other studies show that when the chloride concentration in the water to be disinfected is low the current efficiency of the electrode material for the production of free chlorine is crucial it should be as high as possible 10 14 32 36 the operating characteristics of the sunpur system table 2 need a minimum concentration of 10 mg l and a maximum concentration of 250 mg l of chloride ion according to the analysis of the obtained results from fig 5 the chloride concentration of the water produced by nanofiltration is unstable due to the fluctuations in chloride content in feed water and slightly low 3 mg l 9 mg l for the in situ generation of chlorine in this case the disinfection must therefore be based on other electrogenerated species by using specific anodes to produce ozone directly from the water instead of chlorine 3h2o o3 6e 6h for this the anodes require specific conditions such as high oxygen overvoltage high current density and low water temperature 13 3 2 optimization of a new membrane treatment plant combined with the electrochemical disinfection process sunpur process bypass blending blending permeate with raw groundwater is the least cost technique and is accomplished by routing a portion of the raw groundwater around the nf process and blending it with permeate this method needs an optimization between different parameters physical and chemical that influence the quality of water at the inlet of the electrolysis cell such as permeate flow rate chloride concentration of the permeate flow rate of the blended water and chloride concentration of the blended water the purpose of this new installation is to correct the chloride concentration at the inlet of the electrolysis cell ensures a disinfected water with salt content values which agree with the drinking water norms nitrates in particular produce a non scaling water to avoid scaling phenomenon at the electrode surfaces of the electrolyser limit the corrosion of pipes and equipments meet the drinking water standards for this reason the process of the plant requires a general formula to apply directly in order to provide us exactly with the flow rate of the blended water with the nanofiltered water to achieve a safe disinfection the formula is developed as below the number of moles of chloride ions in the permeate is calculated by the eq 5 5 n 1 v p c p where n 1 numbre of moles of chloride ions in the permeate vp volume of permeate cp chloride concentration of the permeate the number of moles of chloride ions in the mixed water is also calculated by the eq 6 6 n 2 v m c e where n 2 numbre of moles of chloride ions in the mixed water vm volume of the mixed water ce chloride concentration of the feed water the total volume of water at the inlet of the catalytic cell is the sum of permeate and the blended water volumes eq 7 7 v t v p v m the desirable concentration of chloride ions is calculated based on the three previous equations 8 c d e s i r a b l e n t v t n 1 n 2 v p v m v p c p v m c e v p v m 9 v m v p c d e s i r a b l e c p c e c d e s i r a b l e 10 q m q p c d e s i r a b l e c p c e c d e s i r a b l e w i t h c e c d e s i r a b l e this equation eq 10 must respect two conditions the minimum chloride concentration required by the electrochemical disinfection process 10 mg l and the maximum nitrate concentration required by moroccan standards 50 mg l therefore the flow rate of the blended water will be limited between two value qp 10 cp cl ce cl 10 and qp 50 cp no3 ce no3 50 the first limited value ensures safe water disinfection and the second ensures safe quality of drinking water in terms of nitrate concentration according to these two conditions the description of the proposed treatment plant is configured schematically in fig 6 the sidi taibi desalination plant is configured with a permeate flow rate of 460 l h at a pressure of 5 bar and a recovery rate of 75 the energy consumed by the plant is 0 2 kwh m3 besides the quality of the permeate is in accordance with sanitary standards because of the low concentration of nitrate 14 mg l which not exceeds the standards required by who 50 mg l 17 concerning chloride concentration 2 mg l is unsatisfactory for a safe disinfection of drinking water table 2 on the other hand the analysis of the results found in terms of hardness alkalinity and the langelier saturation index confirms that the quality of this water needs remineralization in order to reach the following characteristics of the treated water 37 th 8 f tac 8 f depending on the operating conditions of the electrolyser table 2 the chloride concentration chosen to configure the new plant is 11 mg l higher than 10 mg l the minimum chloride concentration required by the electrolyser based on this concentration the flow rate of the blended water is established at 247 l h this new configuration has resulted in an irreproachable performance with a production capacity of 700 l h the recovery rate of 82 4 salinity of 260 mg l nitrate concentration of 35 mg l hardness of 14 8 f and alkalinity of 11 6 f instead of 460 l h 75 60 mg l 14 mg l 2 3 f and 2 1 f respectively table 4 on the other hand the analysis of the energy results in the new studied configuration confirms a decrease in energy consumption with a rate of 50 0 1kwh m3 instead of 0 2kwh m3 moreover the calculation of langelier saturation index indicates that the water produced by the new configuration is non scaling and slightly corrosive for pipes and equipments table 4 the installation of the plant is configured as above fig 7 and table 4 4 conclusion this paper highlights the feasibility study of the processes combination between nanofiltration and electrochemical water disinfection after nearly two years of operation during this period the most prominent conclusions are the following electrodes will have a longer lifetime through the use of a nanofiltration membrane before the electrochemical water disinfection stability of the permeate temperature and permeate flow rate which respects the operating characteristics of electrolysis disinfection the use of renewable energies ensures sufficient electricity production for the electrical needs of the processes combination nanofiltration electrolysis disinfection low chloride concentration of the water produced by nanofiltration for the in situ generation of chlorine mixing raw water with nanofiltered water is an important solution to meet the operating conditions of the electrochemical disinfection process produce a concentration of cl 10 12 mg l acceptable for safe disinfection of water increase the daily production of drinking water 700 l h instead of 460 l h with salt content values which agree with the drinking water norms production of slightly corrosive and non scaling

in the solution respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nanofiltration combined to electrochemical disinfection process evaluation 3 1 1 nanofiltration effect on the electrodes of the electrolysis cell nanofiltration allows to prevent the formation of calcareous deposits caco3 and mg oh 2 at the cathode surface by extracting 92 6 of calcium and 96 3 of magnesium ions present in the feed water underground water table 3 this could be explained by the fact that nanofiltration membrane has a high rejection of charged particles especially bivalent ions making this technology suitable to remove hardness and a wide range of other components in one step 22 29 this behavior acts positively on the electrodes of the electrolysis cell by maintaining constantly their polarities and their activities in terms of chlorine production 14 15 many studies reported that the electrolysis of a water containing high levels of calcium and magnesium ions leads directly to the formation of calcareous deposits on the cathode surface for this a regular reversal of electrode polarity is necessary to remove these deposits unfortunately this method guides to a shortening of the electrode lifetime and a reduction in the active chlorine production 18 30 3 1 2 volumetric flow rate the operating characteristics of the sunpur system table 2 indicate that more than 400 l h of water can safely been disinfected this value is recommended because of the mass transfer mechanisms involved in the electrolysis cell and their effect on the active chlorine production rate when there is enough supporting electrolyte the migration of electroactive species is minimal and the primary mass transport mechanisms are diffusion and convection 20 moreover several researchers have studied the influence of the flow rate on the active chlorine production for different current densities by using different electrodes and they reported that the flow rate has a little influence on the active chlorine production rate whatever the current density applied and the electrode used 14 31 32 according to the obtained results from fig 2 one clearly sees that the evolution curve of permeate over time is divided into five different zones a b c d e in the beginning permeate flow rate is almost stable around 400 l h zone a this stability is mainly influenced by the compatible execution of the operating parameters of nanofiltration membrane the pressure 5 bar and the recovery rate 75 and by respecting the operating characteristics of the membranes used table 1 after almost 9 months of operation a slight decrease in permeate flow rate is observed due to the beginning of fouling 33 b consequently an increase in feed water pressure is operated to ensure a constant permeate flow for a daily needs of potable water zone c this improvement in permeate flow rate is accompanied by an enhancement of fouling d 34 in addition the improved hydraulic performance of the plant occurs immediately after cleaning the fouled membranes zone e hence except the fouling period the membrane has a steady behavior in terms of permeate flow over two years of operation it is stable in the range of 450 l h higher than 400 l h which is quite acceptable for safe disinfection of water by sunpur system 3 1 3 temperature the temperature of the water produced by nanofiltration varies between 293 15 k and 298 15 k throughout the study period fig 3 indeed the production of active chlorine depends generally on the temperature of the disinfected water as the temperature of the water increases the chlorine is consumed more quickly 14 furthermore khelifa et al 35 studied the effect of the temperature on the production of hypochlorite ion clo using a ti ruo2 anode at ph high than 8 and reported a steady production of clo between 283 15 k and 313 15 k and a slight decrease beyond 313 15 k the same results are found by hsu et al 31 for this reason sunpur system requires a water temperature between 277 15 and 298 15 k hence the temperature of the water produced is ideal for safe disinfection by sunpur system 3 1 4 energy storage during the study period the energy storage curve of the sidi taibi plant fig 4 shows that the batteries have enough power min 72 and max 95 for the nanofiltration and the electrochemical disinfection sunpur consumption request this also ensures water disinfection whatever the weather rain heat wind 3 1 5 chloride concentration a recent study shows that from a chloride concentration higher than 7 5 mg l the production of chlorine is remarkable during the electrolysis and below this concentration no chlorine is detected because chlorine could be formed but reduced in consecutive reactions 17 other studies show that when the chloride concentration in the water to be disinfected is low the current efficiency of the electrode material for the production of free chlorine is crucial it should be as high as possible 10 14 32 36 the operating characteristics of the sunpur system table 2 need a minimum concentration of 10 mg l and a maximum concentration of 250 mg l of chloride ion according to the analysis of the obtained results from fig 5 the chloride concentration of the water produced by nanofiltration is unstable due to the fluctuations in chloride content in feed water and slightly low 3 mg l 9 mg l for the in situ generation of chlorine in this case the disinfection must therefore be based on other electrogenerated species by using specific anodes to produce ozone directly from the water instead of chlorine 3h2o o3 6e 6h for this the anodes require specific conditions such as high oxygen overvoltage high current density and low water temperature 13 3 2 optimization of a new membrane treatment plant combined with the electrochemical disinfection process sunpur process bypass blending blending permeate with raw groundwater is the least cost technique and is accomplished by routing a portion of the raw groundwater around the nf process and blending it with permeate this method needs an optimization between different parameters physical and chemical that influence the quality of water at the inlet of the electrolysis cell such as permeate flow rate chloride concentration of the permeate flow rate of the blended water and chloride concentration of the blended water the purpose of this new installation is to correct the chloride concentration at the inlet of the electrolysis cell ensures a disinfected water with salt content values which agree with the drinking water norms nitrates in particular produce a non scaling water to avoid scaling phenomenon at the electrode surfaces of the electrolyser limit the corrosion of pipes and equipments meet the drinking water standards for this reason the process of the plant requires a general formula to apply directly in order to provide us exactly with the flow rate of the blended water with the nanofiltered water to achieve a safe disinfection the formula is developed as below the number of moles of chloride ions in the permeate is calculated by the eq 5 5 n 1 v p c p where n 1 numbre of moles of chloride ions in the permeate vp volume of permeate cp chloride concentration of the permeate the number of moles of chloride ions in the mixed water is also calculated by the eq 6 6 n 2 v m c e where n 2 numbre of moles of chloride ions in the mixed water vm volume of the mixed water ce chloride concentration of the feed water the total volume of water at the inlet of the catalytic cell is the sum of permeate and the blended water volumes eq 7 7 v t v p v m the desirable concentration of chloride ions is calculated based on the three previous equations 8 c d e s i r a b l e n t v t n 1 n 2 v p v m v p c p v m c e v p v m 9 v m v p c d e s i r a b l e c p c e c d e s i r a b l e 10 q m q p c d e s i r a b l e c p c e c d e s i r a b l e w i t h c e c d e s i r a b l e this equation eq 10 must respect two conditions the minimum chloride concentration required by the electrochemical disinfection process 10 mg l and the maximum nitrate concentration required by moroccan standards 50 mg l therefore the flow rate of the blended water will be limited between two value qp 10 cp cl ce cl 10 and qp 50 cp no3 ce no3 50 the first limited value ensures safe water disinfection and the second ensures safe quality of drinking water in terms of nitrate concentration according to these two conditions the description of the proposed treatment plant is configured schematically in fig 6 the sidi taibi desalination plant is configured with a permeate flow rate of 460 l h at a pressure of 5 bar and a recovery rate of 75 the energy consumed by the plant is 0 2 kwh m3 besides the quality of the permeate is in accordance with sanitary standards because of the low concentration of nitrate 14 mg l which not exceeds the standards required by who 50 mg l 17 concerning chloride concentration 2 mg l is unsatisfactory for a safe disinfection of drinking water table 2 on the other hand the analysis of the results found in terms of hardness alkalinity and the langelier saturation index confirms that the quality of this water needs remineralization in order to reach the following characteristics of the treated water 37 th 8 f tac 8 f depending on the operating conditions of the electrolyser table 2 the chloride concentration chosen to configure the new plant is 11 mg l higher than 10 mg l the minimum chloride concentration required by the electrolyser based on this concentration the flow rate of the blended water is established at 247 l h this new configuration has resulted in an irreproachable performance with a production capacity of 700 l h the recovery rate of 82 4 salinity of 260 mg l nitrate concentration of 35 mg l hardness of 14 8 f and alkalinity of 11 6 f instead of 460 l h 75 60 mg l 14 mg l 2 3 f and 2 1 f respectively table 4 on the other hand the analysis of the energy results in the new studied configuration confirms a decrease in energy consumption with a rate of 50 0 1kwh m3 instead of 0 2kwh m3 moreover the calculation of langelier saturation index indicates that the water produced by the new configuration is non scaling and slightly corrosive for pipes and equipments table 4 the installation of the plant is configured as above fig 7 and table 4 4 conclusion this paper highlights the feasibility study of the processes combination between nanofiltration and electrochemical water disinfection after nearly two years of operation during this period the most prominent conclusions are the following electrodes will have a longer lifetime through the use of a nanofiltration membrane before the electrochemical water disinfection stability of the permeate temperature and permeate flow rate which respects the operating characteristics of electrolysis disinfection the use of renewable energies ensures sufficient electricity production for the electrical needs of the processes combination nanofiltration electrolysis disinfection low chloride concentration of the water produced by nanofiltration for the in situ generation of chlorine mixing raw water with nanofiltered water is an important solution to meet the operating conditions of the electrochemical disinfection process produce a concentration of cl 10 12 mg l acceptable for safe disinfection of water increase the daily production of drinking water 700 l h instead of 460 l h with salt content values which agree with the drinking water norms production of slightly corrosive and non scaling

13939,two new catalysts for the electrochemical fenton process sn2 and bi3 cations have been investigated we refer to them as two electron catalysts because they are expected to be oxidized to sn4 and

keywords electro fenton process homogenous catalysis decolorization water remediation 1 introduction synthetic dyes are often used in cosmetic printing textile and pharmaceutical industries and as food colorants 1 2 likewise they are used as a ph indicator in chemical analytics despite being widely used in industry synthetic dyes have a lot of disadvantages the aromatic rings which dyes usually contain make these colored compounds chemically durable and biologically recalcitrant 3 the presence of colored compounds in the environment causes pollution and serious health risk factors 4 6 most

that require further disposal advanced oxidation processes such as fenton s reaction 2 are a more effective removal alternative electrochemical advanced oxidation processes are very useful for the complete removal of persistent organic pollutants which are hard to remove by conventional treatment techniques 18 electro fenton method is based on oxidation due to the intensive production of hydroxyl radicals which attack dye molecules 2 in this method h2o2 is produced at the cathode in a reduction reaction using dissolved oxygen in an acidic environment 1 17 1 o2 2 h 2 e h2o2 hydroxyl radical oh and fe3 ions are generated from the classical fenton s reaction between fe2 and h2o2 2 17 2 fe2 h2o2 h fe3 h2o oh the fe2 ions consumed in the fenton s reaction are regenerated at the cathode in the reduction reaction of fe3 ions 3 17 3 fe3 e fe2 in contrast the molecular oxygen that is necessary for the production of h2o2 is generated on the anode by oxidizing water at the anode in the reactor 4 17 oxygen can also be continuously passed through a reaction mixture 2 19 4 2h2o 4 h o2 4 e the summary reaction can be seen by adding up above processes 5 5 ½ o2 h2o 2 oh the chemical reagents involved in the above reactions are non toxic moreover in situ generation of h2o2 avoids the need for transport and storage of this hazardous substance offers safer operation by providing diluted h2o2 solutions and enhances the mixing of solution 3 therefore the electro fenton process is environment friendly moreover this method is efficient in degrading organic molecules and easy to implement this method is also cheap and ensures high reaction efficiency it effectively degrades many organic compounds 17 also no catalyst pellets remain in the reactor which does not require further disposal 17 some modifications of the classical electro fenton process have been investigated in terms of the used catalyst 20 it was shown that degradation efficiency can be enhanced by using different catalysts than fe2 such as cu mn2 and co2 cations 20 22 the use of cations of other metals gives promise for increasing of degradation of pollutant dyes 20 the mechanism of the electro fenton process with one electron catalysts in general can be represented by the following reactions 6 mn h2o2 h m n 1 h2o oh 7 m n 1 e mn where m is a symbol of metal e g fe cu mn co and n is a charge of cation in this paper we call such catalysts one electron because they change their oxidation state by one in the above reactions our paper presents a comparative study on the degradation of model azo dye metanil yellow and model triarylmethane dye bromocresol green with two new two electron catalysts sn2 and bi3 in aqueous solution in the electro fenton process we refer to them as two electron

report in the literature so far we propose a mechanism of the electro fenton process with two electron catalysts we compare the catalytic activity of two new catalysts in processes with dyes of two different types because they are expected to have different mechanisms of degradation 2 experimental 2 1 material and reagents a commercial metanil yellow and bromocresol green figs 1 and 2 were used in the present study without further purification solutions of h2so4 concentrated and naoh 1 m were used feso4 7h2o snso4 and bi2 so4 3 were used as catalysts and anhydrous na2so4 was used to make supporting electrolyte all reagents were pure for analysis producer poch 2 2 electrochemical apparatus a potentiostat model ep 20 was used in the present study the reactor was a beaker with a volume of 1 dm3 the cathode was a graphite roller of diameter 0 5 cm and length 5 5 cm the anode was a platinum plate of an area 11 5 cm2 a ph meter type cp 505 elmetron with ph electrode type erh 13 hydromet and saturated calomel electrode type ru 10 hydromet sce were also used in the present study the position of each electrode was the same for every reaction however it was found that distance between cathode and anode doesn t affect current 2 3 procedure oxidation of dyes in the electro fenton process was carried out in 800 ml of 0 05 m na2so4 solution in distilled water used as a supporting electrolyte at ph 2 5 the concentration of catalyst in the electrolyte was 0 15 mm this value was chosen arbitrary from the range of 0 1 mm 0 5 mm which was found to be optimal for fe2 cations 23 the amount of dye was 8 mg or 16 mg in reactions with metanil yellow or bromocresol green respectively the volume of supporting electrolyte was measured with a graduated cylinder the ph of the solution was adjusted by the addition of concentrated h2so4 solution and it remained constant during the process in the present study three different catalysts were used their concentration was the same in every measurement each reaction has been repeated 3 times in experiments with bromocresol green it was found that the moment of the addition of na2so4 to the solution of dye affects the efficiency of degradation thus it was decided arbitrarily to add na2so4 3 min after the start of dye dissolving dissolving of bromocresol green lasted 20 min before the start of the saturation with oxygen the cathode and anode were washed with the solutions of concentrated h2so4 and naoh 1 m before and after every reaction the cathodic potential of 0 5 v vs sce was applied in every reaction pure oxygen gas was bubbled before starting the electro fenton oxidation into the supporting electrolyte for 20 min to saturate the aqueous solution the catalyst has been added 5 min before the start of the reaction to let it dissolve the oxygen flow was constant during both the reaction and the saturation with a value of 3 88 n l min the investigated solution was stirred magnetically at a rate of 700 rpm 2 4 monitoring of oxidation reaction for monitoring of the degradation of dyes in aqueous solution by electro fenton oxidation a small amount of reaction mixture was withdrawn from reactor to quartz cuvette and its absorbance was measured with a spectrophotometer metertek sp 850 with a constant interval of 20 min in the range of 0 80 minutes after each measurement withdrawn mixture has been immediately returned to the reactor the absorbance spectra of metanil yellow and bromocresol green in aqueous solution at ph 2 5 were recorded at ambient temperature 25 c 2 c within the wavelength range of 300 700 nm using a spectrophotometer model perkin elmer lambda 20 the measured spectra are presented in figs 3 and 4 the wavelength at which the maximum absorbance exists in both cases is 440 nm based on the derivatives of the absorbance spectra at this wavelength all measurements were made during the reaction to monitor the electro fenton process also voltage proportional to reaction current was measured with a digital voltmeter type v530 mera tronik 3 mechanism of the electro fenton process with two electron catalysts in the electro fenton process with fe2 catalyst following reactions take place 8 fe2 h2o2 h fe3 h2o oh 9 fe3 e fe2 cathode it is well known that tin is observed on the second and fourth sn2 and sn4 oxidation degree and bismuth is observed on the third and fifth bi3 and bi5 oxidation degree therefore we propose the following reactions of sn2 and bi3 cations with hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution 10 sn2 2 h2o2 2 h sn4 2 h2o 2 oh 11 bi3 2 h2o2 2 h bi5 2 h2o 2 oh cations sn4 and bi5 are then reduced on the cathode 12 sn4 2 e sn2 13 bi5 2 e bi3 from these reactions it is obvious that one cation of two electron catalyst produces twice more hydroxyl radicals than classical one electron catalyst thus two electron catalysts should theoretically double the efficiency of decolorization in the electro fenton process 4 results measured absorbance during reactions and final degradation efficiencies in experiments with metanil yellow and bromocresol green are presented in figs 5 and 6 respectively the mean decolorization efficiencies for metanil yellow were 51 63 fe2 56 15 bi3 and 56 63 sn2 while for bromocresole green were 82 67 fe2 72 61 bi3 and 63 02 sn2 the current during the electro fenton process for each reaction was stable in most cases the current was about 6 6 6 7 ma initial current always had a value of 6 7 ma experimental study shows that bi3 and sn2 cations slightly improve the performance of electro fenton reactions in degradation of metanil yellow azo dye fig 5 however these cations are characterized by much more worse performance than fe2 cations in the degradation of triarylmethane dye bromocresol green the degradation of dye in the electro fenton process is a complex system of many reactions 24 25 qiu et al 2015 showed that kinetic model consisting of 18 reactions including reactions at electrodes classical fenton reactions and surface reactions is in good agreement with experimental data 25 however recently it was proved that realistic kinetic modeling of electro fenton process can be reduced to only 5 reactions and it was showed through the rate limiting step approximation that the rate of dye degradation can be expressed as the rate of reaction of catalyst with h2o2 generation of hydroxyl radicals fenton reaction divided by parameter say x describing how much hydroxyl radicals is needed to destroy one molecule of dye 26 this explains why the rates differ between different dyes different x values for different dyes differences between performance of catalysts in reactions with one certain dye can be explained by interplay between catalyst and dye e g complexation reactions 5 conclusions different catalysts have different activity in the electro fenton process it is possible to enhance the degradation efficiency of classical electro fenton reaction by substituting fe2 catalyst cations with sn2 and bi3 cations in process with model azo dye metanil yellow in 80 min long reaction it was found that bi3 and sn2 catalyst cations decrease the performance of the electro fenton process in the degradation of model triarylmethane dye bromocresol green in 80 min long reaction two electron catalysts have been investigated for the first time our study gives evidence that these catalysts work but their efficiency depends on the type of oxidized dye their performance can be potentially increased by optimizing parameters of the electro fenton process such as time and potential of cathode funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration of competing

substituting fe2 catalyst cations with sn2 and bi3 cations in process with model azo dye metanil yellow in 80 min long reaction it was found that bi3 and sn2 catalyst cations decrease the performance of the electro fenton process in the degradation of model triarylmethane dye bromocresol green in 80 min long reaction two electron catalysts have been investigated for the first time our study gives evidence that these catalysts work but their efficiency depends on the type of oxidized dye their performance can be potentially increased by optimizing parameters of the electro fenton process such as time and potential of cathode funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration of competing
