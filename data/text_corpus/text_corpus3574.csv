17870,stocking of bigheaded carp mainly hypophthalmichthys nobilis and h molitrix is commonly used in sub tropical chinese reservoirs to control phytoplankton but with ambiguous results whether these carp act as a phosphorus p source or sink for phytoplankton is debated we compared the trophic structures in twenty three reservoirs with different nutrient concentrations in the flood season after bigheaded carp introduction with the dry season after bigheaded carp harvesting fish biomass was positively related to tp and the slope of the relationship showed no difference between seasons bigheaded carp harvesting exceeded the amount introduced which may explain an observed lower intercept of the relationship and fish biomass to the tp ratio in the dry season fish predation pressure on zooplankton fish zooplankton biomass ratio as a proxy was highest in the flood season and increased with tp in both seasons accordingly zooplankton grazing effect on phytoplankton zooplankton phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy decreased with fish biomass furthermore both the zooplankton biomass and the zooplankton phytoplankton biomass ratio were among the lowest reported in the literature for the nutrient range studied fish grazing effect on phytoplankton fish phytoplankton biomass ratio as a proxy was also highest in the flood season and decreased with tp in both seasons nanoplankton was the dominant phytoplankton group in oligotrophic to mesotrophic reservoirs while filamentous cyanobacteria dominated in eutrophic reservoirs chlorophyll a increased with tp and fish biomass whereas the yield of chlorophyll a per tp chla tp ratio increased with fish biomass accordingly both chlorophyll a and the chla tp ratio were highest in the flood season we conclude that bigheaded carp act as p sink at the ecosystem level but as p source for phytoplankton and enhance the yield of chlorophyll a per tp and thus eutrophication graphical abstract image 1 keywords trophic cascade filter feeding fish phytoplankton p source reservoir restoration 1 introduction fish play a key role in the trophic dynamics of aquatic ecosystems through top down and bottom up processes schindler et al 2001 jeppesen et al 2010 weber and brown 2015 phosphorus p inputs and recycling have the potential to increase productivity of freshwater systems while predation affects the allocation of p among the trophic levels based on a multiple lake fish community manipulation experiment lemmens et al 2018 argued that phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass are mainly determined by bottom up factors and zooplankton and phytoplankton community composition mainly by top down factors fish mediate bottom up effects both directly through their excretion egestion and indirectly through effects on zooplankton excretion carpenter et al 1992 attayde and hansson 2001 vanni et al 2006 in addition fish can increase nutrient availability to phytoplankton through either feeding in benthic zone transporting and releasing benthic derived nutrients into the water column or their bioturbation activities see review by atkinson et al 2017 introduction of fish into naturally fishless lakes often increases phytoplankton production and the standing crop due to increased p recycling e g leavitt et al 1994 schindler et al 2001 fish modify the p supply to phytoplankton in two ways by acting as p sink by incorporating p and as a p source by regenerating p johnson et al 2010 whether fish act as a p sink or source for phytoplankton depends on the functional composition of the fish community on the composition of their diet and on the source of p that fish regenerate mazumder et al 1989 vanni et al 2013 kelly et al 2018 as small bodied zooplankton have higher mass specific rates of p recycling than large zooplankton fish can affect the zooplankton p recycling rate by changing the zooplankton species composition and size structure mazumder 1994 in temperate piscivore dominated systems piscivores reduce zooplanktivores leading to the development of large bodied zooplankton that efficiently convert p into biomass and enhance p sedimentation carpenter and kitchell 1993 the p return rate of the entire food web is slow because both fish and zooplankton have relatively slow p turnover rates thus p inputs do not accumulate as phytoplankton intensifying p limitation of phytoplankton in contrast in temperate zooplanktivore dominated systems zooplanktivorous fish tend to render more p available to phytoplankton and enhance the phytoplankton biomass due to the reduced role of zooplankton as a sink for p and faster p turnover by the smaller bodied zooplanktivorous fish and zooplankton mazumder et al 1989 vanni and findlay 1990 phytoplankton p is transferred to higher trophic levels or is lost from the water column at a relatively slow rate and p tends to accumulate in phytoplankton exhibiting higher phytoplankton biomass per unit p and lower zooplankton biomass to phytoplankton biomass ratio carpenter et al 1992 thus removal of zooplanktivorous fish via intensive fishing and or piscivorous fish enhancement or stocking has commonly been used as a method to improve the ecological quality of temperate lakes hansson et al 1998 søndergaard et al 2008 in contrast to temperate freshwater fish communities large strictly piscivorous fish are few in tropical and subtropical freshwater bodies and the fish stock is often dominated by omnivorous filter feeding species see review by jeppesen et al 2005 lin et al 2014 omnivorous filter feeding fish not only feed on zooplankton they also consume phytoplankton and suspended detritus zhou et al 2009 and may thus reach a higher carrying capacity than obligate zooplanktivores they may change the biomass and size composition of zooplankton both via predation and by competition for phytoplankton and detritus sources gu et al 1996 okun et al 2008 in addition they may increase phytoplankton biomass indirectly by nutrient recycling and accessing terrestrial detritus p source that are not normally available to phytoplankton and change size composition directly by ingesting large sized phytoplankton as well figueredo and giani 2005 vanni et al 2006 okun et al 2008 besides they can hardly be controlled by zooplankton availability or by predation since many are larger than their potential predators thus omnivorous filter feeding fish can regulate plankton in ways not predicted by cascading interactions and have different effects on plankton dynamics and nutrient recycling than obligate zooplanktivorous fish vanni et al 2005 attayde et al 2010 bigheaded carp mainly hypophthalmichthys nobilis and h molitrix are large omnivorous filter feeders that have been introduced widely to sub tropical lakes and reservoirs due to their ability of filtering phytoplankton and reliance on phytoplankton for much of their diet they are often stocked to improve the ecological quality of water bodies e g starling 1993 datta and jana 1998 lin et al 2013 2014 however the observed effects of bigheaded carp on phytoplankton and water transparency have been contradictory some studies found that bigheaded carp were efficient in controlling total phytoplankton biomass when phytoplankton was dominated by either net phytoplankton or cyanobacteria concentrated in dense blooms or floating mats e g laws and weisburd 1990 radke and kahl 2002 collins and wahl 2017 however other studies demonstrated that h molitrix did not reduce the phytoplankton biomass and sometimes even increased it e g spataru et al 1983 milstein et al 1985 wang et al 2008 long term monitoring of kentucky lake showed that the establishment of h molitrix had no effect on phytoplankton biomass in late summer when filamentous cyanobacteria dominated tumolo and flinn 2017 a modified minimal model of planktivory by attayde et al 2010 suggested a unimodal relationship may exist between the biomass of omnivorous filter feeding fish and the biomass of phytoplankton they argued that this relationship might have important consequences for the biomanipulation of eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes using filter feeding fish in sub tropical chinese reservoirs stocked with bigheaded carp fish production increased with total phosphorus tp while tp was correlated with the extent of agricultural land use in their watersheds lin et al 2003a 2014 furthermore lin et al 2014 found that the chlorophyll a yield per tp was higher in the subtropical reservoirs than typically observed in temperate lakes high detritus loading is generally correlated with agricultural land use in their watersheds as indicated by stable nitrogen isotope analysis hou et al 2013 ning et al 2013 bigheaded carp can consume suspended detritus and mobilize particulate p into the dissolved form in the water column through excretion rendering these nutrients available to phytoplankton kelly et al 2018 argued that detritivorous fish mediated nutrient cycling in reservoirs would be an important source of p for primary producers and thus provide resilience against the control of phytoplankton biomass the high ratio of chlorophyll a to tp indicated that the grazing effect of bigheaded carp may be offset by phytoplankton enhancement through increasing p availability lin et al 2014 to gain better insight into the effect of stocking bigheaded carp on the ecological quality of sub tropical chinese reservoirs we surveyed the trophic structure of 23 reservoirs encompassing oligotrophic to hypertrophic conditions before and after bigheaded carp harvesting we hypothesized that stocking of bigheaded carp strongly affected the flux of p among the trophic levels summarized in fig 1 and specifically that 1 bigheaded carp would act as a p sink at ecosystem level due to harvesting but would not effectively reduce p concentration in the water column and that 2 bigheaded carp would act as p source for phytoplankton due to their effect on p recycling beyond their herbivorous effect on phytoplankton 2 materials and methods 2 1 study reservoirs the 23 reservoirs studied are located in south china fig 2 and a detailed description can be found in lin et al 2003b the reservoirs were selected to cover a wide range in land use from forest dominated to agriculture dominated information on reservoir characteristics is summarized in table 1 all the selected reservoirs are stocked with bigheaded carp for fish production and water quality improvement as the reservoirs are typically poor spawning sites the production of bigheaded carp is maintained by periodic stocking of young of the year yoy fish each year in the early flood season april yoy h nobilis and h molitrix 6 20 kg ha 1 depending on nutrient concentrations are released into reservoirs with an introduction ratio of three to one the stocked bigheaded carp 1 kg individual 1 are selectively captured from october to december in the dry season 2 2 sampling and analysis hydroacoustic surveys were conducted to estimate fish abundance and biomass during june to july in the flood season after the introduction of yoy fish and november to december in the dry season after fish harvesting in 2015 acoustic data were collected with a biosonics dt x echosounder at a frequency of 200 khz 6 6 the split beam transducer was set on a metal frame on the side of the vessel and deployed approximately 0 5 m below the surface with the sonar beam being vertically oriented to ensure an efficient cover of the whole reservoir surface the degree of coverage was set to 6 and the total survey length d was calculated from the equation d a ½ where a size of the reservoir area all surveys were conducted during the day along a fixed cruise track and used a programmed global positioning system for navigation of paralleled transects at speeds of 6 7 km h 1 the system was calibrated using a standard copper sphere according to foote et al 1987 before the survey began a pulse duration of 0 5 ms and a pulse rate of 5 pings per second were used throughout the surveys fish density and biomass were estimated through target strength ts analysis and echo integration we used echoview 5 4 to analyze all data an automatic algorithm was used to define the bottom line 0 3 m above the detected bottom a surface line was added to each echogram at a distance of 2 m from the transducer to avoid the near field and wave disturbance only the data between these two lines were analyzed to preclude bottom echoes and surface noise being integrated to fish backscattering measurements the values of mean ts were calculated from the average backscattering cross section σ bs of every recorded single target above 56 db a threshold to eliminate non fish echoes simmonds and maclennan 2005 fish density ρ ind m 3 was calculated using the equation ρ s v σ bs where s v volume backscattering coefficient single target detection criteria were set as follows a 56 db ts threshold a pulse length of 0 6 1 8 times the transmitted pulse length at 6 db within 4 db of the center of the transducer beam and a standard deviation of the angles minor and major axis of all samples within the pulse envelope of less than 0 6 fish target lengths were derived by converting ts to fish length via love s equation love 1977 then converting fish length to weight using the length weight equation for filter feeding fish in sub tropical chinese reservoirs weight 0 07 length2 6258 unpublished the temperature profile was taken at 1 m intervals at the deepest point of each reservoir using a multi parameter probe ysi6600 zooplankton were collected by net hauls wisconsin style 40 cm diameter 40 μm mesh integrated over the whole water column at the deepest point of each reservoir and preserved in 4 buffered formalin zooplankton were identified counted and measured under a microscope with an ocular micrometer koste 1978 shen and song 1979 korovchinsky 1992 ueda and reid 2003 biomass of cladocerans and copepods was estimated from length weight relationships based on length measurements of 30 individuals of each species zhang and huang 1991 for rotifers we calculated the individual body volume using geometric shapes biomass for each rotifer species was obtained by assuming a specific gravity of 1 thirty individuals of bigheaded carp 200 800 g individual 1 were collected with gill nets for p content analysis fish were dried at 60 c until a constant weight was obtained then the whole fish was ground to powder and p content was measured with the molybdenum blue method following hcl digestion stainton et al 1977 depth integrated water samples from surface to bottom were taken with a 5 l uwitec water sampler for analysis of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip 20 μm particulate phosphorus pp 200 μm pp total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn phytoplankton and chlorophyll a chla water samples were fractionated within 1 h of collection with polycarbonate filter with pore size of 0 2 μm and preached nitex screens with mesh sizes of 20 and 200 μm after filtration each filter was placed into a screw capped test tube containing 20 ml of distilled and deionized water filtrate through 0 2 μm was analyzed for dissolved inorganic phosphorus with the molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 tp 20 μm and 200 μm pp were determined as molybdate reactive phosphorus following persulfate digestion and tn as nitrate by the uv method after potassium persulfate digestion menzel and corwin 1965 gross et al 1999 chla was determined spectrophotometrically after extraction in acetone lin et al 2005 water samples for phytoplankton community analysis were preserved with 1 lugol s phytoplankton was counted using an utermöhl chamber and inverted microscope and volumes estimated from geometrical shapes utermöhl 1958 only the relative biomass of filamentous cyanobacteria was reported here phytoplankton biomass can be expressed both in chla and mass units the reason for choosing chla in the following analysis was that there is a risk of underestimating true phytoplankton mass in low nutrient reservoirs hessen 2006 picophytoplankton generally contributes a considerable proportion to total phytoplankton biomass in nutrient poor freshwater systems however they will not be properly accounted for using the conventional utermöhl technique in order to estimate ratios of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass and fish to phytoplankton biomass we approximated the total biomass of phytoplankton as chla multiplied by 67 average obtained for temperate lakes jeppesen et al 1997 this approach allowed us to make a comparison with temperate zooplanktivore dominated lakes where similar studies had been done jeppesen et al 2003 2011 we used stepwise forwards and backwards procedure multiple regression to analyze effects of temperature tp tn zooplankton biomass and fish biomass on chla and the chla to tp ratio for zooplankton biomass and the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio we used tp tn chla temperature and fish biomass and the relative biomass of filamentous cyanobacteria as independent variables for fish we used tp tn temperature chla and depth as independent variables we then use variation partitioning to reveal the unique effects of tp and fish biomass on chla a paired t test was conducted to test the difference of tp tn p bound in fish biomass fish biomass the fish biomass to tp ratio the fish to zooplankton biomass ratio the fish to phytoplankton biomass ratio chla the chla to tp ratio zooplankton biomass and the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio between the flood season and the dry season multiple regression and paired t test were performed with the arm package and variation partitioning with the vegan package in r variables were log transformed prior to analysis 3 results 3 1 temperature and nutrients temperature varied from 27 to 31 c in the flood season and from 15 to 20 c in the dry season and was significantly higher in the flood season than in the dry season mean of the seasonal differences 8 c 95 confidence interval ci 6 10 c fig 3 a the twenty three reservoirs covered a wide range of trophic states with tp ranging between 10 and 52 μg l 1 and tn between 380 and 3290 μg l 1 neither tp nor tn showed significant difference between the flood season and the dry season mean of the seasonal differences in tp 1 8 μg l 1 ci 1 9 5 4 μg l 1 mean of the seasonal differences in tn 64 μg l 1 ci 193 65 μg l 1 fig 3b and c about 73 4 94 7 of tp was

seasonal differences 4 2 ci 2 4 5 9 fig 3d the dissolved inorganic p concentration was generally lower than 3 μg l 1 in both seasons in contrast more than 50 of tn was in dissolved inorganic form regardless of trophic state and season indicating that the investigated reservoirs were p limited systems 3 2 fish and plankton biomass fish biomass varied from 0 3 to 21 0 g m 3 and p bound in fish biomass from 0 096 to 3 359 kg ha 1 p content of dry weight for bigheaded carp 1 02 0 21 both of them were significantly higher in the flood season than in the dry season mean of the seasonal

fish biomass was positively related to tp but not to temperature tn and depth the slope of the relationship between fish biomass and tp showed no significant difference between seasons t 1 509 p 0 14 while the intercept was higher in the flood season than in the dry season table 2 fig 4b therefore the fish biomass to tp fish tp ratio was significantly higher in the flood season than in the dry season mean of the seasonal differences 142 ci 84 200 fig 4c bigheaded carp harvesting 1 kg individual 1 varied from 90 to 360 kg ha 1 depending on reservoir trophic state likely explaining the lower fish biomass and fish tp ratio in the dry season hypophthalmichthys nobilis contributed more than 70 of the harvest irrespective of reservoir trophic state chla ranged from 1 4 to 91 0 μg l 1 and was significantly higher in the flood season than in the dry season mean of the seasonal differences 5 3 μg l 1 ci 0 1 10 6 μg l 1 fig 5 a multiple regression analysis showed that chla was positively related to tp and fish biomass but not to tn and temperature table 2 fig 5b and c the unique effects of tp 71 9 was much larger than of fish biomass 4 in a variation partitioning analysis filamentous cyanobacteria tended to dominate in reservoirs with tp 20 μg l 1 in both seasons and the dominant species were cylindrospermopsis raciborskki dolichospermum planctonica d circinalis or limnothrix

related to tp but not to fish biomass regardless of season table 2 fig 5d and e in reservoirs with tp 20 μg l 1 phytoplankton was generally dominated by nanophytoplankton such as cyclotella spp mallomonas spp cryptomonas ovata cosmarium meneghinni peridinium pusillum and gomphonema spp zooplankton biomass was generally low ranging between 60 and 829 μg l 1 and it was significantly higher in the flood season than in the dry season mean of the seasonal differences 31 μg l 1 ci 2 59 μg l 1 fig 6 a zooplankton biomass was positively related to chla but not to tp in a multiple regression table 2 fig 6b both the slope and intercept of the relationship between zooplankton biomass and chla showed no significant difference between the flood season and the dry season zooplankton were dominated by either cladocerans or copepods cladocerans contributed 5 3 85 4 to zooplankton biomass and the relative biomass of cladocerans was higher in the dry season than in the flood season mean of the seasonal differences 16 4 ci 4 9 27 9 fig 6c in contrast the percentage of copepods ranged between 5 6 and 88 5 and was higher in the flood season than in the dry season mean of the seasonal differences 16 ci 3 3 28 6 fig 6d the cladoceran community was generally dominated by small species such as bosmina fatalis bosminopsis deitersi diaphanosoma orghidani and moina micrura while copepods were dominated by phyllodiaptomus tunguidus mongolodiaptomus birulai heliodiaptomus serratus or mesocyclops thermocyclopoides only one daphnia species d galeata occurred in the dry season in six reservoirs fengshuba hedi heshui liuxihe xinfengjiang and yitang and their abundance were less than 1 ind l 1 regardless of reservoir trophic state 3 3 trophic structure the ratios of fish biomass to phytoplankton biomass fish phyto ratio and fish biomass to zooplankton biomass fish zoo ratio varied from 0 07 to 2 4 and from 1 03 to 59 8 respectively paired t test revealed that both ratios were significantly higher in the flood season than in the dry season mean of the seasonal differences in fish phyto ratio 0 38 ci 0 13 0 62 mean of the seasonal differences in fish zoo ratio 13 6 ci 8 4 18

the relationships did not differ between seasons while both intercepts were higher in the flood season than in the dry season the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass zoo phyto ratio varied from 0 005 to 0 151 and was significantly higher in the dry season than in the flood season mean of the seasonal differences 0 02 ci 0 007 0 033 fig 8 a multiple regression revealed that the ratio was negatively related to fish biomass and the relative biomass of filamentous cyanobacteria regardless of season table 2 fig 8b and c the chlorophyll a to tp chla tp ratio ranged from 0 11 to 1 75 in the flood season and from 0 10 to 1 66 in the dry season and was much higher in the flood season than in the dry season mean of the seasonal differences 0 16 ci 0 02 0 29 fig 9 a the yield chlorophyll a per unit of tp was positively associated with fish biomass explaining 55 of the variation in the chla tp ratio table 2 fig 9b but was not associated with temperature 4 discussion 4 1 bigheaded carp as an ecosystem level p sink fish biomass represents a large p pool in the water of reservoirs reflecting in part that fish tissues generally have a high p content compared with phytoplankton and many abiotic pools p bound in fish biomass was roughly 9 120 of the tp in seston in the flood season 50 in half of the studied reservoirs and decreased to 3 48 in the dry season fish may therefore represent an important sink of p depending on harvest rate emigration rate introduction rate immigration rate temporal changes in biomass and feeding habits terrestrial prey or aquatic benthic or pelagic prey vanni et al 2013 we found that both fish biomass and fish catch had positive associations with tp indicating that the production of bigheaded carp was controlled by bottom up factors resources furthermore the harvested biomass of bigheaded carp in the dry season exceeded substantially the biomass of the stocked yoy bigheaded carp in the flood season making bigheaded carp a p sink at the ecosystem level under the current harvesting regime in these sub tropical reservoirs yoy bigheaded carp introduction imported about 0 02 0 05 kg p ha 1 into the reservoirs contributing 1 3 to the p bound in fish biomass in the flood season subtracting this from the p bound in harvested bigheaded carp fish harvesting actually removed about 0 15 0 62 kg p ha 1 from the reservoirs data on watershed p inputs were only available for one oligo mesotrophic reservoir liuxihe obtained from lin et al 2018 and one eutrophic reservoir nanping obtained from local reservoir management department and the annual p loading was 18 6 80 in the flood season and 93 3 kg ha 1 60 in the flood season respectively p bound in fish biomass was 2 9 3 6 of the p loading in the flood season and decreased to 0 6 1 1 in the dry season only 0 7 1 8 of the annual p input was sequestered into fish biomass and left the reservoirs through harvesting suggesting that bigheaded carp was minor contributor to the p sink at the ecosystem level 4 2 bigheaded carp as p source to the water column while bigheaded carp management was a p sink at the ecosystem level they may not necessarily be a sink of p in the water column bigheaded carp can reduce sedimentation of p bound in detritus and plankton either by consuming detritus or plankton or more indirectly by changing the plankton community structure see review by lazzaro 1987 reservoirs generally receive a large amount of detritus from their catchments via inlet rivers and overland flows in the flood season which may constitute an important carbon source to omnivorous filter feeding fish kelly et al 2018 based on stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis lin et al 2018 found that terrestrial sources contributed more than 50 to the particulate organic carbon in an oligo mesotrophic reservoir with watershed land use dominated by forest liuxihe reservoir one of our studied reservoirs both terrestrial particulate organic matter loading and the allochthony of zooplankton were higher in the flood season than in the dry season lin et al 2018 bigheaded carp prefer open areas and occupy the upper and middle layers of the water column where they filter and consume suspended detritus and plankton it seems likely that bigheaded carp by direct consumption of terrestrial detritus reduce the sedimentation of terrestrial detritus derived p and thereby increase the availability of dissolved inorganic p to the phytoplankton in the water column via excretion as indicated by the fact that chla increased with tp and fish biomass and that the chla tp ratio increased with fish biomass similarly a study on ohio reservoirs vanni et al 2006 spanning a wide range of watershed land use showed that the excretion of terrestrial detritus derived p in dissolved inorganic forms by omnivorous fish reinforced the effects of increased nutrient loading from watersheds with increasing agriculture these authors found that p recycling by omnivorous fish supported an increasing proportion of primary production as watersheds became more agricultural and reservoirs more eutrophic our results and earlier studies by lin et al 2014 and zhao et al 2013 provide ample evidence of bigheaded carp control of zooplankton community structure and biomass in sub tropical chinese reservoirs firstly zooplankton were dominated either by small cladocerans or by copepods irrespective of tp which is consistent with the findings in zooplanktivore dominated systems jeppesen et al 2011 lin et al 2017 barbiero et al 2019 moreover bigheaded carp harvesting led to an decrease in the fish zoo ratio and an increase in the relative biomass of cladocerans in the dry season secondly only one daphnia species d galeata occurred in a few of these reservoirs and had low abundances despite that harvesting of bigheaded carp resulted in an increase in d galeata abundance in the dry season the fish predation pressure was still high enough to prevent the dominance of d galeata which never exceeded 1 ind l 1 regardless of tp thirdly harvesting of bigheaded carp was associated with a decrease in the fish zoo ratio and an increase in the zoo phyto ratio in the dry season however both zooplankton biomass and the zoo phyto ratio usually below 0 15 were low compared with those of most temperate and many subtropical lakes with a similar tp range jeppesen et al 2003 2011 havens and beaver 2011 accordingly bigheaded carp may have reduced the p loss from the water column by reducing zooplankton biomass and favouring dominance of copepods or small cladocerans that contribute less to p sedimentation in these sub tropical chinese reservoirs only 0 2 2 9 of tp was in meso zooplankton fraction and a large fraction of p was tied up in phytoplankton biomass regardless of tp suggesting that the contribution of zooplankton to p sedimentation was low terrestrial detritus derived p enters reservoirs via overland flows in the flood season and progressively settles during the transport from the riverine to the lacustrine zone thornton 1990 vanni et al 2001 both lower p loading in the dry season and progressive p sequestration in bigheaded carp and sediment deposits may result in lower tp concentrations in the water column in the dry season than in the flood season however we found no apparent decline in tp concentrations in the water columns after half a year s growth of bigheaded carp it seems likely that reduced p sedimentation by bigheaded carp offset the effect of p sequestration by bigheaded carp on the tp concentration in the lacustrine water columns 4 3 bigheaded carp as p source for phytoplankton based on a multiple lake fish manipulation experiment lemmens et al 2018 suggested that phytoplankton biomass is mainly determined by bottom up factors whereas phytoplankton species composition is mainly determined by top down factors in sub tropical chinese reservoirs p controls phytoplankton growth lin et al 2014 and chla increases with tp and fish biomass bigheaded carp modify the p supply to phytoplankton in three ways they may act as p sink by incorporating p and as a p source by regenerating dissolved inorganic p in addition they may modify p partitioning among zooplankton and phytoplankton through predation as well whether they act mainly as a sink or a source to phytoplankton depends on the proportion of phytoplankton in their diet on the size composition of phytoplankton community and on the relative strength of the direct and indirect effects of fish predation and excretion attayde and menezes 2008 we confirmed that bigheaded carp tended to be p source for the water column bigheaded carp consume phytoplankton and their filtering efficiency partly depends on the mesh size of their gill rakers and on the size and shape of the particle being ineffective at filtering particles 10 μm and filamentous cyanobacteria smith 1989 tumolo and flinn 2017 ochs et al 2019 they suppress phytoplankton through grazing and act as p sink only when large phytoplankton accounts for a greater proportion of the total phytoplankton biomass radke and kahl 2002 in contrast the effects of bigheaded carp do apparently not differ from those of zooplanktivorous fish and they act as p source when phytoplankton is dominated by nanophytoplankton zhao et al 2013 in the present study phytoplankton was dominated either by nanophytoplankton in oligotrophic to mesotrophic reservoirs or by filamentous cyanobacteria in eutrophic reservoirs regardless of the season both the fish grazing pressure on phytoplankton and the predation pressure on zooplankton were much higher in the flood season after bigheaded carp introduction than in the dry season after bigheaded carp harvesting indicated by much higher fish phyto and fish zoo ratios in the flood season however both chla and the chla tp ratio were not only much higher in the flood season but also increased with fish biomass indicating that the indirect effects of bigheaded carp on nanophytoplankton or filamentous cyanobacteria exceeded their direct grazing effects enclosure experiments in liuxihe reservoir also confirmed that the effect of bigheaded carp on nanophytoplankton and zooplankton were biomass dependent both chla and the chla tp ratio were much higher in the treatment with high bigheaded carp biomass than in the low fish biomass treatment and vice versa for zooplankton biomass and the zoo phyto ratio under the same p inputs q lin unpublished data in the present study zooplankton were dominated by small species regardless of tp and were not capable of controlling phytoplankton as indicated by the low zoo phyto ratio accordingly p was primarily sequestered into nanophytoplankton or filamentous cyanobacteria rather than into zooplankton and dissolved pools and consequently a major portion of the tp pool was represented by plankton 20 μm furthermore we found that not only chla increased with tp and fish biomass but also the chla tp ratio increased with fish biomass an enclosure experiment by drenner et al 1996 confirmed that filter feeding fish interact synergistically with trophic state so that the limnological effects of omnivorous fish become more intense with increased eutrophication our data also support these findings 5 conclusions we found that stocking of bigheaded carp acted as a p sink at the ecosystem level under the current targeted harvesting regime for these fish in sub tropical chinese reservoirs meanwhile our results also support the view that stocking of bigheaded carp alone may not be sufficient to suppress phytoplankton in eutrophic reservoirs on the contrary these carp are more likely to act as p source for phytoplankton leading to a higher chlorophyll a per unit of tp for eutrophic reservoir management stocking bigheaded carp can therefore not be recommended for phytoplankton control if the goal is to control the entire phytoplankton biomass and enhance water quality instead a reduction of the external p loading should have highest priority in order to suppress phytoplankton biomass at least in a long term perspective declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment this

biomass whereas the yield of chlorophyll a per tp chla tp ratio increased with fish biomass accordingly both chlorophyll a and the chla tp ratio were highest in the flood season we conclude that bigheaded carp act as p sink at the ecosystem level but as p source for phytoplankton and enhance the yield of chlorophyll a per tp and thus eutrophication graphical abstract image 1 keywords trophic cascade filter feeding fish phytoplankton p source reservoir restoration 1 introduction fish play a key role in the trophic dynamics of aquatic ecosystems through top down and bottom up processes schindler et al 2001 jeppesen et al 2010 weber and brown 2015 phosphorus p inputs and recycling have the potential to increase productivity of freshwater systems while predation affects the allocation of p among the trophic levels based on a multiple lake fish community manipulation experiment lemmens et al 2018 argued that phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass are mainly determined by bottom up factors and zooplankton and phytoplankton community composition mainly by top down factors fish mediate bottom up effects both directly through their excretion egestion and indirectly through effects on zooplankton excretion carpenter et al 1992 attayde and hansson 2001 vanni et al 2006 in addition fish can increase nutrient availability to phytoplankton through either feeding in benthic zone transporting and releasing benthic derived nutrients into the water column or their bioturbation activities see review by atkinson et al 2017 introduction of fish into naturally fishless lakes often increases phytoplankton production and the standing crop due to increased p recycling e g leavitt et al 1994 schindler et al 2001 fish modify the p supply to phytoplankton in two ways by acting as p sink by incorporating p and as a p source by regenerating p johnson et al 2010 whether fish act as a p sink or source for phytoplankton depends on the functional composition of the fish community on the composition of their diet and on the source of p that fish regenerate mazumder et al 1989 vanni et al 2013 kelly et al 2018 as small bodied zooplankton have higher mass specific rates of p recycling than large zooplankton fish can affect the zooplankton p recycling rate by changing the zooplankton species composition and size structure mazumder 1994 in temperate piscivore dominated systems piscivores reduce zooplanktivores leading to the development of large bodied zooplankton that efficiently convert p into biomass and enhance p sedimentation carpenter and kitchell 1993 the p return rate of the entire food web is slow because both fish and zooplankton have relatively slow p turnover rates thus p inputs do not accumulate as phytoplankton intensifying p limitation of phytoplankton in contrast in temperate zooplanktivore dominated systems zooplanktivorous fish tend to render more p available to phytoplankton and enhance the phytoplankton biomass due to the reduced role of zooplankton as a sink for p and faster p turnover by the smaller bodied zooplanktivorous fish and zooplankton mazumder et al 1989 vanni and findlay 1990 phytoplankton p is transferred to higher trophic levels or is lost from the water column at a relatively slow rate and p tends to accumulate in phytoplankton exhibiting higher phytoplankton biomass per unit p and lower zooplankton biomass to phytoplankton biomass ratio carpenter et al 1992 thus removal of zooplanktivorous fish via intensive fishing and or piscivorous fish enhancement or stocking has commonly been used as a method to improve the ecological quality of temperate lakes hansson et al 1998 søndergaard et al 2008 in contrast to temperate freshwater fish communities large strictly piscivorous fish are few in tropical and subtropical freshwater bodies and the fish stock is often dominated by omnivorous filter feeding species see review by jeppesen et al 2005 lin et al 2014 omnivorous filter feeding fish not only feed on zooplankton they also consume phytoplankton and suspended detritus zhou et al 2009 and may thus reach a higher carrying capacity than obligate zooplanktivores they may change the biomass and size composition of zooplankton both via predation and by competition for phytoplankton and detritus sources gu et al 1996 okun et al 2008 in addition they may increase phytoplankton biomass indirectly by nutrient recycling and accessing terrestrial detritus p source that are not normally available to phytoplankton and change size composition directly by ingesting large sized phytoplankton as well figueredo and giani 2005 vanni et al 2006 okun et al 2008 besides they can hardly be controlled by zooplankton availability or by predation since many are larger than their potential predators thus omnivorous filter feeding fish can regulate plankton in ways not predicted by cascading interactions and have different effects on plankton dynamics and nutrient recycling than obligate zooplanktivorous fish vanni et al 2005 attayde et al 2010 bigheaded carp mainly hypophthalmichthys nobilis and h molitrix are large omnivorous filter feeders that have been introduced widely to sub tropical lakes and reservoirs due to their ability of filtering phytoplankton and reliance on phytoplankton for much of their diet they are often stocked to improve the ecological quality of water bodies e g starling 1993 datta and jana 1998 lin et al 2013 2014 however the observed effects of bigheaded carp on phytoplankton and water transparency have been contradictory some studies found that bigheaded carp were efficient in controlling total phytoplankton biomass when phytoplankton was dominated by either net phytoplankton or cyanobacteria concentrated in dense blooms or floating mats e g laws and weisburd 1990 radke and kahl 2002 collins and wahl 2017 however other studies demonstrated that h molitrix did not reduce the phytoplankton biomass and sometimes even increased it e g spataru et al 1983 milstein et al 1985 wang et al 2008 long term monitoring of kentucky lake showed that the establishment of h molitrix had no effect on phytoplankton biomass in late summer when filamentous cyanobacteria dominated tumolo and flinn 2017 a modified minimal model of planktivory by attayde et al 2010 suggested a unimodal relationship may exist between the biomass of omnivorous filter feeding fish and the biomass of phytoplankton they argued that this relationship might have important consequences for the biomanipulation of eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes using filter feeding fish in sub tropical chinese reservoirs stocked with bigheaded carp fish production increased with total phosphorus tp while tp was correlated with the extent of agricultural land use in their watersheds lin et al 2003a 2014 furthermore lin et al 2014 found that the chlorophyll a yield per tp was higher in the subtropical reservoirs than typically observed in temperate lakes high detritus loading is generally correlated with agricultural land use in their watersheds as indicated by stable nitrogen isotope analysis hou et al 2013 ning et al 2013 bigheaded carp can consume suspended detritus and mobilize particulate p into the dissolved form in the water column through excretion rendering these nutrients available to phytoplankton kelly et al 2018 argued that detritivorous fish mediated nutrient cycling in reservoirs would be an important source of p for primary producers and thus provide resilience against the control of phytoplankton biomass the high ratio of chlorophyll a to tp indicated that the grazing effect of bigheaded carp may be offset by phytoplankton enhancement through increasing p availability lin et al 2014 to gain better insight into the effect of stocking bigheaded carp on the ecological quality of sub tropical chinese reservoirs we surveyed the trophic structure of 23 reservoirs encompassing oligotrophic to hypertrophic conditions before and after bigheaded carp harvesting we hypothesized that stocking of bigheaded carp strongly affected the flux of p among the trophic levels summarized in fig 1 and specifically that 1 bigheaded carp would act as a p sink at ecosystem level due to harvesting but would not effectively reduce p concentration in the water column and that 2 bigheaded carp would act as p source for phytoplankton due to their effect on p recycling beyond their herbivorous effect on phytoplankton 2 materials and methods 2 1 study reservoirs the 23 reservoirs studied are located in south china fig 2 and a detailed description can be found in lin et al 2003b the reservoirs were selected to cover a wide range in land use from forest dominated to agriculture dominated information on reservoir characteristics is summarized in table 1 all the selected reservoirs are stocked with bigheaded carp for fish production and water quality improvement as the reservoirs are typically poor spawning sites the production of bigheaded carp is maintained by periodic stocking of young of the year yoy fish each year in the early flood season april yoy h nobilis and h molitrix 6 20 kg ha 1 depending on nutrient concentrations are released into reservoirs with an introduction ratio of three to one the stocked bigheaded carp 1 kg individual 1 are selectively captured from october to december in the dry season 2 2 sampling and analysis hydroacoustic surveys were conducted to estimate fish abundance and biomass during june to july in the flood season after the introduction of yoy fish and november to december in the dry season after fish harvesting in 2015 acoustic data were collected with a biosonics dt x echosounder at a frequency of 200 khz 6 6 the split beam transducer was set on a metal frame on the side of the vessel and deployed approximately 0 5 m below the surface with the sonar beam being vertically oriented to ensure an efficient cover of the whole reservoir surface the degree of coverage was set to 6 and the total survey length d was calculated from the equation d a ½ where a size of the reservoir area all surveys were conducted during the day along a fixed cruise track and used a programmed global positioning system for navigation of paralleled transects at speeds of 6 7 km h 1 the system was calibrated using a standard copper sphere according to foote et al 1987 before the survey began a pulse duration of 0 5 ms and a pulse rate of 5 pings per second were used throughout the surveys fish density and biomass were estimated through target strength ts analysis and echo integration we used echoview 5 4 to analyze all data an automatic algorithm was used to define the bottom line 0 3 m above the detected bottom a surface line was added to each echogram at a distance of 2 m from the transducer to avoid the near field and wave disturbance only the data between these two lines were analyzed to preclude bottom echoes and surface noise being integrated to fish backscattering measurements the values of mean ts were calculated from the average backscattering cross section σ bs of every recorded single target above 56 db a threshold to eliminate non fish echoes simmonds and maclennan 2005 fish density ρ ind m 3 was calculated using the equation ρ s v σ bs where s v volume backscattering coefficient single target detection criteria were set as follows a 56 db ts threshold a pulse length of 0 6 1 8 times the transmitted pulse length at 6 db within 4 db of the center of the transducer beam and a standard deviation of the angles minor and major axis of all samples within the pulse envelope of less than 0 6 fish target lengths were derived by converting ts to fish length via love s equation love 1977 then converting fish length to weight using the length weight equation for filter feeding fish in sub tropical chinese reservoirs weight 0 07 length2 6258 unpublished the temperature profile was taken at 1 m intervals at the deepest point of each reservoir using a multi parameter probe ysi6600 zooplankton were collected by net hauls wisconsin style 40 cm diameter 40 μm mesh integrated over the whole water column at the deepest point of each reservoir and preserved in 4 buffered formalin zooplankton were identified counted and measured under a microscope with an ocular micrometer koste 1978 shen and song 1979 korovchinsky 1992 ueda and reid 2003 biomass of cladocerans and copepods was estimated from length weight relationships based on length measurements of 30 individuals of each species zhang and huang 1991 for rotifers we calculated the individual body volume using geometric shapes biomass for each rotifer species was obtained by assuming a specific gravity of 1 thirty individuals of bigheaded carp 200 800 g individual 1 were collected with gill nets for p content analysis fish were dried at 60 c until a constant weight was obtained then the whole fish was ground to powder and p content was measured with the molybdenum blue method following hcl digestion stainton et al 1977 depth integrated water samples from surface to bottom were taken with a 5 l uwitec water sampler for analysis of dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip 20 μm particulate phosphorus pp 200 μm pp total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn phytoplankton and chlorophyll a chla water samples were fractionated within 1 h of collection with polycarbonate filter with pore size of 0 2 μm and preached nitex screens with mesh sizes of 20 and 200 μm after filtration each filter was placed into a screw capped test tube containing 20 ml of distilled and deionized water filtrate through 0 2 μm was analyzed for dissolved inorganic phosphorus with the molybdenum blue method murphy and riley 1962 tp 20 μm and 200 μm pp were determined as molybdate reactive phosphorus following persulfate digestion and tn as nitrate by the uv method after potassium persulfate digestion menzel and corwin 1965 gross et al 1999 chla was determined spectrophotometrically after extraction in acetone lin et al 2005 water samples for phytoplankton community analysis were preserved with 1 lugol s phytoplankton was counted using an utermöhl chamber and inverted microscope and volumes estimated from geometrical shapes utermöhl 1958 only the relative biomass of filamentous cyanobacteria was reported here phytoplankton biomass can be expressed both in chla and mass units the reason for choosing chla in the following analysis was that there is a risk of underestimating true phytoplankton mass in low nutrient reservoirs hessen 2006 picophytoplankton generally contributes a considerable proportion to total phytoplankton biomass in nutrient poor freshwater systems however they will not be properly accounted for using the conventional utermöhl technique in order to estimate ratios of zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass and fish to phytoplankton biomass we approximated the total biomass of phytoplankton as chla multiplied by 67 average obtained for temperate lakes jeppesen et al 1997 this approach allowed us to make a comparison with temperate zooplanktivore dominated lakes where similar studies had been done jeppesen et al 2003 2011 we used stepwise forwards and backwards procedure multiple regression to analyze effects of temperature tp tn zooplankton biomass and fish biomass on chla and the chla to tp ratio for zooplankton biomass and the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio we used tp tn chla temperature and fish biomass and the relative biomass of filamentous cyanobacteria as independent variables for fish we used tp tn temperature chla and depth as independent variables we then use variation partitioning to reveal the unique effects of tp and fish biomass on chla a paired t test was conducted to test the difference of tp tn p bound in fish biomass fish biomass the fish biomass to tp ratio the fish to zooplankton biomass ratio the fish to phytoplankton biomass ratio chla the chla to tp ratio zooplankton biomass and the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio between the flood season and the dry season multiple regression and paired t test were performed with the arm package and variation partitioning with the vegan package in r variables were log transformed prior to analysis 3 results 3 1 temperature and nutrients temperature varied from 27 to 31 c in the flood season

seasonal differences 4 2 ci 2 4 5 9 fig 3d the dissolved inorganic p concentration was generally lower than 3 μg l 1 in both seasons in contrast more than 50 of tn was in dissolved inorganic form regardless of trophic state and season indicating that the investigated reservoirs were p limited systems 3 2 fish and plankton biomass fish biomass varied from 0 3 to 21 0 g m 3 and p bound in fish

while the intercept was higher in the flood season than in the dry season table 2 fig 4b therefore the fish biomass to tp fish tp ratio was significantly higher in the flood season than in the dry season mean of the seasonal differences 142 ci 84 200 fig 4c bigheaded carp harvesting 1 kg individual 1 varied from 90 to 360 kg ha 1 depending on reservoir trophic state likely explaining the lower fish biomass and fish tp ratio in the dry season hypophthalmichthys nobilis contributed more than 70 of the harvest irrespective of reservoir trophic state chla ranged from 1 4 to 91 0 μg l 1 and was significantly higher in the flood season than in the dry season mean of the seasonal differences 5 3 μg l 1 ci 0 1 10 6 μg l 1 fig 5 a multiple regression analysis showed that chla was positively

table 2 fig 6b both the slope and intercept of the relationship between zooplankton biomass and chla showed no significant difference between the flood season and the dry season zooplankton were dominated by either cladocerans or copepods cladocerans contributed 5 3 85 4 to zooplankton biomass and the relative biomass of cladocerans was higher in the dry season than in the flood season mean

differences 16 ci 3 3 28 6 fig 6d the cladoceran community was generally dominated by small species such as bosmina fatalis bosminopsis deitersi diaphanosoma orghidani and moina micrura while copepods were dominated by phyllodiaptomus tunguidus mongolodiaptomus birulai heliodiaptomus serratus or mesocyclops thermocyclopoides only one daphnia species d galeata occurred in the dry season in six reservoirs fengshuba hedi heshui liuxihe xinfengjiang and yitang and their abundance were less than 1 ind l 1 regardless of reservoir trophic state 3 3 trophic structure the ratios of fish biomass to

unit of tp was positively associated with fish biomass explaining 55 of the variation in the chla tp ratio table 2 fig 9b but was not associated with temperature 4 discussion 4 1 bigheaded carp as an ecosystem level p sink fish biomass represents a large p pool in the water of reservoirs reflecting in part that fish tissues generally have a high p content compared with phytoplankton and many abiotic pools p bound in fish biomass was roughly 9 120 of the tp in seston in the flood season 50 in half of the studied reservoirs and decreased to 3 48 in the dry season fish may therefore represent an important sink of p depending on harvest rate emigration rate introduction rate immigration rate temporal changes in biomass and feeding habits terrestrial prey or aquatic benthic or pelagic prey vanni et al 2013 we found that both fish biomass and fish catch had positive associations with tp indicating that the production of bigheaded carp was controlled by bottom up factors resources furthermore the harvested biomass of bigheaded carp in the dry season exceeded substantially the biomass of the stocked yoy bigheaded carp in the flood season making bigheaded carp a p sink at the ecosystem level under the current harvesting regime in these sub tropical reservoirs yoy bigheaded carp introduction imported about 0 02 0 05 kg p ha 1 into the reservoirs contributing 1 3 to the p bound in fish biomass in the flood season subtracting this from the p bound in harvested bigheaded carp fish harvesting actually removed about 0 15 0 62 kg p ha 1 from the reservoirs data on watershed p inputs were only available for one oligo mesotrophic reservoir liuxihe obtained from lin et al 2018 and one eutrophic reservoir nanping obtained from local reservoir management department and the annual p loading was 18 6 80 in the flood season and 93 3 kg ha 1 60 in the flood season respectively p bound in fish biomass was 2 9 3 6 of the p loading in the flood season and decreased to 0 6 1 1 in the dry season only 0 7 1 8 of the annual p input was sequestered into fish biomass and left the reservoirs through harvesting suggesting that bigheaded carp was minor contributor to the p sink at the ecosystem level 4 2 bigheaded carp as p source to the water column while bigheaded carp management was a p sink at the ecosystem level they may not necessarily be a sink of p in the water column bigheaded carp can reduce sedimentation of p bound in detritus and plankton either by consuming detritus or plankton or more indirectly by changing the plankton community structure see review by lazzaro 1987 reservoirs generally receive a large amount of detritus from their catchments via inlet rivers and overland flows in the flood season which may constitute an important carbon source to omnivorous filter feeding fish kelly et al 2018 based on stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis lin et al 2018 found that terrestrial sources contributed more than 50 to the particulate organic carbon in an oligo mesotrophic reservoir with watershed land use dominated by forest liuxihe reservoir one of our studied reservoirs both terrestrial particulate organic matter loading and the allochthony of zooplankton were higher in the flood season than in the dry season lin et al 2018 bigheaded carp prefer open areas and occupy the upper and middle layers of the water column where they filter and consume suspended detritus and plankton it seems likely that bigheaded carp by direct consumption of terrestrial detritus reduce the sedimentation of terrestrial detritus derived p and thereby increase the availability of dissolved inorganic p to the phytoplankton in the water column via excretion as indicated by the fact that chla increased with tp and fish biomass and that the chla tp ratio increased with fish biomass similarly a study on ohio reservoirs vanni et al 2006 spanning a wide range of watershed land use showed that the excretion of terrestrial detritus derived p in dissolved inorganic forms by omnivorous fish reinforced the effects of increased nutrient loading from watersheds with increasing agriculture these authors found that p recycling by omnivorous fish supported an increasing proportion of primary production as watersheds became more agricultural and reservoirs more eutrophic our results and earlier studies by lin et al 2014 and zhao et al 2013 provide ample evidence of bigheaded carp control of zooplankton community structure and biomass in sub tropical chinese reservoirs firstly zooplankton were dominated either by small cladocerans or by copepods irrespective of tp which is consistent with the findings in zooplanktivore dominated systems jeppesen et al 2011 lin et al 2017 barbiero et al 2019 moreover bigheaded carp harvesting led to an decrease in the fish zoo ratio and an increase in the relative biomass of cladocerans in the dry season secondly only one daphnia species d galeata occurred in a few of these reservoirs and had low abundances despite that harvesting of bigheaded carp resulted in an increase in d galeata abundance in the dry season the fish predation pressure was still high enough to prevent the dominance of d galeata which never exceeded 1 ind l 1 regardless of tp thirdly harvesting of bigheaded carp was associated with a decrease in the fish zoo ratio and an increase in the zoo phyto ratio in the dry season however both zooplankton biomass and the zoo phyto ratio usually below 0 15 were low compared with those of most temperate and many subtropical lakes with a similar tp range jeppesen et al 2003 2011 havens and beaver 2011 accordingly bigheaded carp may have reduced the p loss from the water column by reducing zooplankton biomass and favouring dominance of copepods or small cladocerans that contribute less to p sedimentation in these sub tropical chinese reservoirs only 0 2 2 9 of tp was in meso zooplankton fraction and a large fraction of p was tied up in phytoplankton biomass regardless of tp suggesting that the contribution of zooplankton to p sedimentation was low terrestrial detritus derived p enters reservoirs via overland flows in the flood season and progressively settles during the transport from the riverine to the lacustrine zone thornton 1990 vanni et al 2001 both lower p loading in the dry season and progressive p sequestration in bigheaded carp and sediment deposits may result in lower tp concentrations in the water column in the dry season than in the flood season however we found no apparent decline in tp concentrations in the water columns after half a year s growth of bigheaded carp it seems likely that reduced p sedimentation by bigheaded carp offset the effect of p sequestration by bigheaded carp on the tp concentration in the lacustrine water columns 4 3 bigheaded carp as p source for phytoplankton based on a multiple lake fish manipulation experiment lemmens et al 2018 suggested that phytoplankton biomass is mainly determined by bottom up factors whereas phytoplankton species composition is mainly determined by top down factors in sub tropical chinese reservoirs p controls phytoplankton growth lin et al 2014 and chla increases with tp and fish biomass bigheaded carp modify the p supply to phytoplankton in three ways they may act as p sink by incorporating p and as a p source by regenerating dissolved inorganic p in addition they may modify p partitioning among zooplankton and phytoplankton through predation as well whether they act mainly as a sink or a source to phytoplankton depends on the proportion of phytoplankton in their diet on the size composition of phytoplankton community and on the relative strength of the direct and indirect effects of fish predation and excretion attayde and menezes 2008 we confirmed that bigheaded carp tended to be p source for the water column bigheaded carp consume phytoplankton and their filtering efficiency partly depends on the mesh size of their gill rakers and on the size and shape of the particle being ineffective at filtering particles 10 μm and filamentous cyanobacteria smith 1989 tumolo and flinn 2017 ochs et al 2019 they suppress phytoplankton through grazing and act as p sink only when large phytoplankton accounts for a greater proportion of the total phytoplankton biomass radke and kahl 2002 in contrast the effects of bigheaded carp do apparently not differ from those of zooplanktivorous fish and they act as p source when phytoplankton is dominated by nanophytoplankton zhao et al 2013 in the present study phytoplankton was dominated either by nanophytoplankton in oligotrophic to mesotrophic reservoirs or by filamentous cyanobacteria in eutrophic reservoirs regardless of the season both the fish grazing pressure on phytoplankton and the predation pressure on zooplankton were much higher in the flood season after bigheaded carp introduction than in the dry season after bigheaded carp harvesting indicated by much higher fish phyto and fish zoo ratios in the flood season however both chla and the chla tp ratio were not only much higher in the flood season but also increased with fish biomass indicating that the indirect effects of bigheaded carp on nanophytoplankton or filamentous cyanobacteria exceeded their direct grazing effects enclosure experiments in liuxihe reservoir also confirmed that the effect of bigheaded carp on nanophytoplankton and zooplankton were biomass dependent both chla and the chla tp ratio were much higher in the treatment with high bigheaded carp biomass than in the low fish biomass treatment and vice versa for zooplankton biomass and the zoo phyto ratio under the same p inputs q lin unpublished data in the present study zooplankton were dominated by small species regardless of tp and were not capable of controlling phytoplankton as indicated by the low zoo phyto ratio accordingly p was primarily sequestered into nanophytoplankton or filamentous cyanobacteria rather than into zooplankton and dissolved pools and consequently a major portion of the tp pool was represented by plankton 20 μm furthermore we found that not only chla increased with tp and fish biomass but also the chla tp ratio increased with fish biomass an enclosure experiment by drenner et al 1996 confirmed that filter feeding fish interact synergistically with trophic state so that the limnological effects of omnivorous fish become more intense with increased eutrophication our data also support these findings 5 conclusions we found that stocking of bigheaded carp acted as a p sink at the ecosystem level under the current targeted harvesting regime for these fish in sub tropical chinese reservoirs meanwhile our results also support the view that stocking of bigheaded carp alone may not be sufficient to suppress phytoplankton in eutrophic reservoirs on the contrary these carp are more likely to act as p source for phytoplankton leading to a higher chlorophyll a per unit of tp for eutrophic reservoir management stocking bigheaded carp can therefore not be recommended for phytoplankton control if the goal is to control the entire phytoplankton biomass and enhance water quality instead a reduction of the external p loading should have highest priority in order to suppress phytoplankton biomass at least in a long term perspective declaration of competing

the most promising techniques to solve the environmental issues loeb et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b as a metal free semiconductor with a band gap energy 2 70 ev graphitic carbon nitride cn has been broadly employed in photocatalytic treatment of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation cao et al 2015 wang et al 2018b zheng et al 2014 however the pristine cn suffers from moderate photocatalytic activity primarily because of its low crystallinity and insufficient redox potential as for the crystallinity the conventional bulk cn bcn derived from the thermally induced polymerization of n containing precursors presents amorphous structure with abundant defects guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2018a such defects would act as recombination centers for electron hole pairs to limit the intrinsic photocatalytic activity of bcn in addition the incomplete deamination of the dicyandiamide might result in the formation of a tri s triazine based structure with one dimensional chain of nh bridged melon oligomers lotsch et al 2010 leading to low conductivity and accordingly weak charge mobility ability another concern facing bcn is its inefficient oxidation potential its valence band vb locating at 1 57 v nhe is inactive to directly oxidize h2o molecules to generate hydroxyl radicals oh for the organic pollutant decomposition wang et al 2019b fortunately its conduction band cb approximating 1 13 v nhe is theoretically powerful enough to reduce o2 molecules to produce superoxide radicals o2 wang et al 2019a the o2 then undergoes a multi step reduction process to produce h2o2 eventually converting into oh eqs 1 5 hu et al 2014 kim et al 2010 li et al 2016 generally hydrogen peroxide as the precursor of oh might be generated through either a sequential two step single electron indirect reduction process o 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 or a one step two electron direct reduction o 2 h 2 o 2 route during the cn photocatalytic process kim et al 2018 liu et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 obviously in either pathway h2o2 yield is highly dependent on the generation efficiency and the mobility of the photogenerated electrons in addition to the adsorption capability of o2 on the surface of cn catalyst as bcn presents the rapid recombination of electron hole pairs and low charge carrier mobility bcn exhibits a low photocatalytic degradation activity

wang et al lin et al 2019 found that forming crystalline cn ccn with fully condensed tri s triazine based structure can enhance the photogenerated charge carrier generation and mobility herein we aim to investigate the generation pathway of reactive oxygen species ross on ccn the ccn was synthesized via a kcl licl molten salt method various characterizations confirm the high crystalline nature with fully condensed tri s triazine based structure the as prepared ccn showed outstanding photocatalytic performance towards degrading ppcps under visible light irradiation the photocatalysis mechanism was further systematically studied from both experimental and computational aspects we propose a direct two electron reduction for h2o2 generation on ccn compared with a successive single electron reduction process on bcn we also evaluate the technical feasibility of ccn photocatalytic process in the real aquatic environment including treating ppcps at trace concentration range 20 μg l mixed with natural water matrixes mixed with complex contaminants and under natural sunlight irradiation this study offers a promising sustainable technique to treat the ppcps contaminated water 2

photocatalytic experiments were performed in an cel lb70 3 rotary photochemical reactor ceaulight in which a 350 w xe lamp with a 420 nm cut off filter was used as the visible light source in a typical experiment 50 mg of the photocatalyst was introduced into a quartz tube that contained 50 ml of 8 mg l ppcps which was stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure the adsorption desorption equilibrium during irradiation 2 ml of the suspension was extracted at a certain interval and subsequently filtered via 0 22 μm millipore filters for mixed pollutants experiment eight kinds of ppcps 8 mg l was added into quartz tube with 50 mg of photocatalyst all experiments were performed at least in triplicate the residual concentration of ppcps was analyzed using shimadzu lc 16a high performance liquid chromatography hplc japan to analyze the trace concentration 20 μg l of ppcps a solid phase extraction method was applied the degradation products generated during the photocatalytic process were identified by agilent 1100 series high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry hplc ms ms usa the detailed analytical methods of hplc and hplc ms ms are given in texts s1 s2 and table s2 2 5 determination of ross during photocatalytic degradation the production of hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 in the photocatalytic degradation process wan detected directly by an electron spin resonance esr bruker model esr jes fa200 spectrometer with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as spin trapping agent to verify the contribution of ross radical scavenging experiments were applied by using benzoquinone bq 1 0 mm isopropanol ipa 10 mm sodium oxalate na2c2o4 10 mm and potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 50 μm as the scavengers of o2 oh photogenerated hole h and photogenerated electron e respectively furthermore the formation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in photocatalytic reaction suspension was detected via a fluorescence method with p hydroxyphenyl acetic acid pohpaa as the peroxide indicator wang et al 2014 detail detection method can be found in text s3 2 6 theoretical calculation based on density functional theory dft we used castep modulus in materials studio to optimize all configurations as well as to calculate the band structure reaction pathway and molecular orbital the exchange correlation interactions were described by generalized gradient approximation gga with perdew burke ernzerhof pbe functional perdew et al 1996 spin polarization was included in all calculations and a damped van der waals correction was incorporated using grimme s scheme to describe the non bonding interactions du et al 2012 norm conserving was used in all the pseudopotentials calculations 310 ev cutoff energy was used for the plane wave molecular orbital calculations of npx were conducted in the gaussian 09 program with the b3lyp 6 311g d p level the detailed calculation method is conveyed in the text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization physicochemical properties of the as prepared materials were systematically investigated powder x ray diffraction data are shown in fig 1 a bcn displays two characteristic diffraction peaks at 13 0 and 27 2 indexed to 100 and 002 crystal facets corresponding to the stacking of conjugated aromatic system and the in plane tri s triazine stacking structural packing motifs in the conjugated aromatic units respectively the 100 peak of ccn shifts from 13 0 to 8 0 corresponding to the increasing of layer distance from 0 680 nm to 1 104 nm which indicates the improvement on the crystallinity caused by the insert of li k ions into the layer planes lin et al 2016 compared with bcn fig s2 the high crystallinity of ccn is also confirmed by the clear lattice fringes observed from the hr tem images fig 1b the measured lattice spacing of 1 085 nm match that of the 100 plane which is consistent with the xrd analysis meanwhile the ccn revealed a smaller full width at half maximum than bcn indicating the well developed and more condensed crystal structure of ccn two distinct peaks at 163 1 and 156 5 ppm corresponding to n2 cn and cn3 units were observed in the solid state 13c nmr spectrum fig s3 which confirms the presence of tri s triazine units in the ccn the ft ir spectrum in fig s4 shows that the characteristic bands of ccn are similar to that of bcn indicating that the primary chemical structure of bcn is maintained after the molten salt treatment process moreover the peak located at 400 5 ev in the xps n1s spectra figs s5 and s6 corresponds to the terminal amino functions c n h become weaker after the molten salt treatment process indicating that a fully condensed tri s triazine based structure might be formed within the ccn framework the optical and electrochemical properties of the as prepared materials were then studied according to the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs fig s7 the light absorption ability of ccn is significantly enhanced the bandgaps of bcn and ccn are measured to be 2 67 ev and 2 72ev according to kubelka munk function as shown in the inset of fig s7 respectively the charge separation efficiency is investigated using the steady state and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy techniques with results shown in figs s8 and 1c the ccn exhibits a considerably weaker pl emission intensity compared with bcn implying that the charge separation efficiency is improved through forming crystalline structure the lifetime τ of the ccn determined from fitting time resolved fluorescence decay spectra fig 1c is 1 78256 ns compared to 5 31498 ns for bcn the shorter lifetime of photo induced carriers indicates a higher photocatalytic activity according to the prior report guo et al 2016 the electronic structures of the as prepared samples were investigated by room temperature epr spectroscopy as shown in fig s9 the single lorentzian lines of ccn shows stronger intensity than that of bcn indicating a high conductivity of ccn due to its highly ordered structure allowing for the improved delocalization of electrons liu et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 these results were further confirmed by photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra eis measurements as expected the photocurrent intensity of the ccn was significantly higher than that of bcn fig 1d which revealed the higher separation and transfer efficiencies of photogenerated electron hole pairs in ccn furthermore a significantly decreased diameter in semicircular nyquist plots was observed in ccn fig s10 compared to bcn which implied the superior electronic conductivity of ccn cao et al 2015 according to the above measurements the highly crystalline structure of ccn was confirmed in detail the high crystallinity enables an enhanced light absorption ability in addition to the improved charge generation separation and transport efficiency which is beneficial for the following phototcatalytic degradation performance 3 2 photocatalytic performance degradation of ppcps under visible light irradiation was used to gauge the photocatalytic activities of ccn materials toward the persistent organic pollutants with bcn serving as a reference catalyst as shown in fig 2a s11a and s11b ccn showed consistently higher photocatalytic activities than bcn toward the degradation of eight different ppcps pollutants including naproxen npx indomethacin idm diclofenac dcf carbamazepine cbz triclosan tcs ofloxacin ofx enrofloxacin enr sulfamethoxazole sme the enhancements in terms of photodegradation rate constant ranges from 7 1 times for enr to 2256 6 times for sme the removal rate varies from different kinds of ppcps molecules it might be due to their different chemical structures associated with different physicochemical properties and different adsorption abilities over the ccn materials the great versatility allows the treatment of a wide range of organic pollutants under optimized conditions to further study the photocatalytic kinetics mechanism and the degradation pathway npx 9 8 times with the moderate photodegradation activities on ccn and bcn was chosen as a probe pollutant compound as shown in fig 2 b the negligible self photolysis and hydrolysis confirmed the photochemical stability of the npx evidently the removal efficiency of npx by ccn 98 4 at the reaction time of 70 min under visible light irradiation was considerably higher than that of bcn 20 9 indicating that the tri s triazine based crystalline structure facilitates the photocatalytic reactions 3 3 photocatalysis mechanism 3 3 1 transformation mechanism of reactive oxygen species to investigate the photocatalysis mechanism ross involved in the ppcps photodegradation process were determined by electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy using dmpo as the spin trapping agent as indicated in fig 3 a and b negligible esr signals were observed under dark conditions the characteristic peaks for dmpo oh adducts quartet with 1 2 2 1 signal intensity and dmpo o2 adducts quartet with 1 1 1 1 signal intensity were presented under visible light irradiation suggesting the existence of oh and o2 in the ccn photocatalytic system in addition ccn photocatalytic system showed much stronger oh and o2 signals than bcn indicating that the crystalline structure allows the production of more ross to further quantitatively determine the contribution of various ross during the photocatalytic process ros quenching experiments were conducted in the bcn photocatalytic process the npx photodegradation was slightly accelerated upon the addition of ipa implying the negligible role of oh fig 3c and s12 on the contrary in the presence of bq k2cr2o7 and na2c2o4 the npx photodegradation inhibition rates reach to 52 11 47 37 and 26 32 respectively indicating that o2 derived from e played a vital role in the bcn photocatalytic system interestingly we found that ccn responded to the quenching experiments in a different manner as shown in fig 3c the degradation of npx were significantly suppressed in the presence of ipa 91 56 of inhibition rate indicating the predominant role of oh during the ccn photocatalytic process more importantly the addition of k2cr2o7 and bq also led to the inhibition of photocatalytic activity with inhibition rates of 60 24 and 93 98 while adding na2c2o4 only resulted in a slight enhancement on the npx degradation the results indicated that the oh might be generated from the conduction band electrons and or o2 rather than valence band holes on the ccn photocatalysts therefore we proposed that the predominant ross changed from o2 to oh due to the improvement on the cn crystallinity caused by the molten salt treatment process previous studies have confirmed that oh could be produced via the decomposition of h2o2 during the carbon nitride photocatalytic process cai et al 2019 li et al 2016 in order to explore the oh formation mechanism the photocatalytic h2o2 production ability over the as prepared bcn and ccn were measured by the fluorescence method as shown in fig 3d almost no h2o2 was detected in bcn suspensions under the visible light irradiation for 90 min however the crystalline ccn produces a significantly enhanced h2o2 yield with a maximum concentration of 3 2 μmol l compared with 0 2 μmol l for bcn at the same condition to better explain the formation process of h2o2 photogenerated electron transfer number has been detected via the analysis of the oxygen reduction reaction orr in the electrochemical rotating disk electrode rde the lsv curves of various electrodes in oxygen saturated electrolytes were shown in fig 3e s13a and s13b rotation speed ranging from 0 to 2000 rpm apparently the ccn catalysts showed higher cathodic current densities than bcn indicating that crystalline structure promoted the orr rates the relationship between current density and rotation speed at plateau currents can be described by koutecky levuch equation fig 3e and s13c where the electron transfer number n of bcn and ccn was calculated to be 1 5 and 2 4 respectively it suggests that the ccn is most likely to trigger a direct two electron orr to generate h2o2 while bcn predominate the single electron orrs to produce o2 the entire orr reaction pathway including i o2 adsorption ii ooh generation via coupling o2 with a proton and an electron and iii h2o2 formation was further simulated using dft calculations with the adsorption energy diagrams shown in fig 4 a and b in the first step the released energy associated with the adsorption of oxygen on ccn and bcn is 0 094 and 0 439 ev respectively subsequently the adsorbed o2 couples with a proton and an electron and transfers to ooh with the corresponding released energy of 0 313 and 0 734 ev on ccn and bcn respectively these two steps are both exothermic processes that can be carried out spontaneously in the third step additional protons and electrons are introduced to ccn and bcn to produce h2o2 it can be observed that ccn system shows a negligible adsorption energy of 0 012 ev which is much lower than in the bcn system 0 500 ev such low energy barrier is beneficial for the h2o2 generation on ccn material which agrees well with our experimental observations to get a deeper understanding of the generation of h2o2 on ccn the projected density of states pdos and orbitals of ooh adsorbed on the ccn and bcn were calculated it could be observed that there is hybridization between the orbits of s s s p p p in both systems and forms the σ s σ s σ p π p π p bonds fig 4c s14 s15 and s16 those bonds play important roles for the whole system as indicated by the pdos in addition spin down π p orbital in ccn system is half empty at fermi level and another empty band is at 1 5 ev which prefers to accept external electrons and induce the third reaction step to take place however bcn system shows much smaller empty bands and much higher energy than ccn system implying that the bcn system exhibits a weaker capability to accept electrons therefore the last step of producing h2o2 reaction is theoretically difficult in bcn system while almost no barrier for the electron transfer from spin up π p to spin down π p orbital in ccn system in the third step of reaction pathway the specific values of bond length in molecules before and after the addition of protons and electrons to produce h2o2 are listed in table s3 for ccn systems the change of o h bond length is about 0 030 å while the variation range on bcn from 0 139 to 0 165 å the bond length change in bcn is roughly 5 times that in ccn system such a large structure change would consume high energy which further explains the non spontaneous process of producing h2o2 on bcn finally the photocatalytic generated h2o2 could be decomposed leading to the formation of oh both experimental and computational results revealed the vital roles of o2 during the npx photocatalytic degradation process to further verify the process photodegradation of npx were conducted under the n2 or o2 conditions fig s17 a dramatic decrease in the activity was observed under the atmosphere of n2 while a significant increase was noted under the atmosphere of o2 then the temperature programmed desorption of o2 o2 tpd was performed to investigate the o2 adsorption capacity of the as prepared catalysts as shown in fig 3f bcn displays almost no oxygen desorption peaks whereas the ccn exhibits two oxygen desorption peaks at 167 c and 452 c the results reveal that the high crystallization tri s triazine based structure of ccn facilitates the o2 adsorption process thereby enhance the generation of oh radicals 3 3 2 mineralization and transformation pathways the photodegradation pathway of npx over the ccn catalysts was monitored using the uplc q tof ms analysis figs s18 and s19 shows the tentative structures chromatograms and mass spectrum analysis of eight major degradation byproducts the toc removal efficiencies fig s20 of npx were subsequently examined upon the visible light irradiation for 70 min toc removal efficiency reaches 58 revealing that the npx and its degradation intermediates could be completely mineralized under a continuous solar irradiation in order to further examine the primary reactive sites on the npx molecules gaussian calculations were carried out based on the computation of the frontier electron densities feds and atom point charges it was observed that c 1 c 2 c 5 c 9 and c 10 revealed high electron density higher fed2 homo fed2 lumo value indicating that the naphthalene ring of npx was likely to be attacked by oh while the c 24 with more positive point charge are likely to be attacked by o2 therefore three major pathways including hydroxylation decarboxylation and demethoxylation reactions of npx in ccn photocatalytic process were proposed in fig 5 in pathway 1 the naphthalene ring of npx would undergo the electrophilic adduct reaction by oh attack resulting in the formation of hydroxylation products m z 262 pathway 2 was initiated by the cleavage of the carboxylic group thereby producing the carbon centered radicals t1 subsequently t1 could be attacked by o2 to form m z 218 with a further oxidization process to produce m z 184 and m z 170 t1 could also react with h to give a m z 186 or be attacked by oh to form m z 200 the pathway 3 began with the hydroxylation of the methoxy group on the naphthalene ring with the formation of m z 216 and m z 170 all the intermediates would undergo a further oxidation giving rise to the ring opening products co2 and h2o 3 3 3 potential photocatalytic mechanisms based on the above results the entire photocatalysis mechanism of the ccn materials are proposed below under the sunlight irradiation photogenerated electron holes pairs would be formed as the position of the conduction band 1 41 ev fig s21 was negative than the standard reduction potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev o2 could be easily generated via capturing conduction band e by the dissolved oxygen molecules however the photogenerated holes are inactive to oxidize oh h2o into oh because the valence band position of ccn is more negative than that of oh h2o 2 27 ev vs nhe fortunately the high crystalline tri s triazine based structure of ccn would enhance the o2 adsorption and promote the one step two electron orr reduction pathway thereby leading to the enhance production of oh finally the generated ross particularly oh would attack ppcps molecules leading to their decomposition and mineralization eqs 6 13 6

pollution products h 2 o c o 2 3 4 environmental implication the stability and reusability of a photocatalyst is a key parameter toward its environmental applications herein cycling experiment was first conducted to assess the stability of ccn as shown in fig s22 and 84 88 of photocatalytic activity toward the npx degradation could be maintained after four successive cycles furthermore the xrd pattern and ft ir spectra of the used ccn remained unchanged after catalytic reactions suggesting the robust stability of ccn the feasibility of the ccn photocatalytic oxidation system was then evaluated by the decomposition of npx under various ambient water matrices chaabane et al 2007 conceicao et al 2000 as shown in fig 6 a surprisingly the photocatalytic oxidation degradation of npx showed remarkable enhancement catalytic activity under tap water pearl river water wwtp water and south china sea water this promotion might be attributed to the combined effects of coexisting constituents such as transition metals dissolved organic matter etc as listed in table s1 to further investigate the effect of water constituents degradation of npx was performed in the solution containing of different the inorganic anions cations as well as organic matters as depicted in fig 6b no obvious influence of the photocatalytic degradation of npx were observed in the presence of cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and ha in contrast divalent cations mg2 ca2 particularly the ca2 significantly enhanced the removal efficiency of npx which might be due to the fact that ca2 and mg2 could affect the absorption for npx on the surface of ccn chen and xu 2012 in addition due to the scavenging of the conduction band electrons cu2 showed a significant inhibition on the photocatalytic degradation of npx as another vital parameter in the water environment the effect of the ph value on npx degradation was studied fig 6c it was found that ccn photocatalytic system exhibited an excellent efficiency for npx under a wide ph range even in a strong acidic or alkaline medium to further explain the different reaction rate constants under various ph values the zeta potential of ccn was detected as shown in fig s23 ccn possessed the negative polarity on its surface with the zeta potentials of 15 1 21 4 24 5 27 5 and 34 5 mv when ph was 3 5 7 9 and 11 respectively as the dissociation constant pka of npx was 4 2 an electrostatic attraction between ccn and npx might have occurred when the ph of the solution was below 4 2 which led to the strong absorption affinity between ccn and npx thus accelerating the activity of the ccn system on the contrary an intense electrostatic exclusion might appear when ph was 11 resulting in the modesty photocatalytic activity this superior property of the npx degradation might be attributed to the strong π π interactions with the ccn aguedach et al 2008 wang et al 2018a overall the sufficient degradation of ppcps in natural water matrices confirmed the suitability of ccn photocatalytic system to ameliorate concerns with ppcps under the ambient water conditions it was reported that the real concentration of ppcps in the natural environment ranges from ng l to μg l guo et al 2017 to test whether ccn photocatalytic system could be applied for the remediation of ppcps with trace concentration degradation of npx was performed under the low initial concentration 20 μg l fig 6d using the solid phase extraction method we found that all the npx molecules could be completely decomposed within 30 min of visible light irradiation implying that the ccn photocatalytic system could be applied for the treatment of trace concentration of ppcps considering the complex constitutes of ppcps in the environmental water matrices photocatalytic degradation of the mixed ppcps pollutants including npx idm dcf cbz tcs ofx enr sme has been performed to verify the universality and practical feasibility of the ccn photocatalytic system as shown in fig 6e all the mixed ppcps could be significantly decomposed upon the visible light irradiation detailly npx idm dcf cbz tcs ofx enr and sme showed the removal rates of 79 5 100 100 100 97 2 84 2 95 1 and 79 4 respectively following 150 min of visible light irradiation in the ideal case the photocatalytic water treatment process is powered by natural solar light we therefore used the natural sunlight as the energy source to evaluate the feasibility of the ccn photocatalytic in practical application shows in fig 6f interestingly ccn materials displayed an excellent catalytic activity toward the degradation of npx under natural sunlight irradiation which indicated that this system may be effectively utilized for the remediation of ppcps under natural sunlight condition 4 conclusion in summary we fabricated a highly crystalline carbon nitride catalyst with the fully condensed tri s triazine structure via a molten salt method the tri s triazine based structure of ccn can enhance the generation and mobility of photogenerated charge carrier the crystalline structure facilitates the o2 absorption process and enables a direct oxygen reduction reaction involving a one step two electron pathway as a result the ccn materials produces a much higher h2o2 generation efficiency compared with bcn confirmed by both experimental and computational analysis the h2o2 finally converted into oh radicals to decompose the ppcps in the water samples more importantly the ccn catalysts could be used to treat ppcps at the trace concentration range in the natural water matrixes under the natural sunlight irradiation and in the mixed pollutants also the ccn catalysts exhibits excellent stability this work provided a new strategy in producing a high performance photocatalyst for the treatment of ppcps contaminated water and it advances our understanding of adjusting ros generation pathway via improving the crystallinity of the catalyst declaration of competing interest the

17871,pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps an emerging class of highly recalcitrant water contaminants have raised considerable concerns in environment community graphitic carbon nitride cn has shown a great potential towards the photodegradation of water contaminants under visible light irradiation however the conventional bulk cn bcn presents the amorphous structure resulting in an inefficient yield of hydroxyl radicals oh for the complete mineralization of ppcps this study provides fundamental insights into significantly enhancing the hydroxyl radical generation via improving the crystallinity of the pristine cn materials experimental measurements and accompanying density functional theory dft computational analysis suggest that the crystalline carbon nitride ccn exhibited an enhanced adsorption ability towards the dissolved o2 upon the light irradiation the adsorbed o2 molecules readily undergo a direct two electron reduction reaction on the ccn surface instead of the conventional two successive single electron reduction reactions on the bcn surface to produce h2o2 subsequently converting into oh radicals along with the improved charge separation efficiency and electron transfer ability ccn based materials show superior photocatalytic activity towards ppcps type pollutants compared with the pristine bcn catalysts importantly the catalyst show excellent photodegradation activities under natural sunlight irradiation at low ppcps concentration 20 μg l in the mixed ppcps solution or in the real wastewater water samples indicating the potential of ccn to enable practical ex situ destructive treatment of ppcps contaminated groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps photodegradation crystalline carbon nitride hydroxyl peroxide hydroxyl radical 1 introduction effective water treatment techniques for destructive removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps an emerging class of highly persistent water contaminants have yet to be established the conventional water treatment approaches targeting ppcps are often insufficient as a result ppcps with the concentration ranging from ng l up to μg l hanamoto et al 2013 kuroda et al 2012 meyer et al 2019 have been detected in the effluent of wastewater recent studies have shown that the presence of ppcps in aquatic systems would lead to the harmful toxicological consequences and adverse ecological effects on the microbiological and human health bittner et al 2019 méndez arriaga et al 2008 o brien et al 2017 therefore developing the effective and sustainable treatment approaches towards ppcps is of great urgency driven by the renewable solar energy semiconductor mediated photocatalysis has been considered as one of the most promising techniques to solve the environmental issues loeb et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b as a metal free semiconductor with a band gap energy 2 70 ev graphitic carbon nitride cn has been

conduction band cb approximating 1 13 v nhe is theoretically powerful enough to reduce o2 molecules to produce superoxide radicals o2 wang et al 2019a the o2 then undergoes a multi step reduction process to produce h2o2 eventually converting into oh eqs 1 5 hu et al 2014 kim et al 2010 li et al 2016 generally hydrogen peroxide as the precursor of oh might be generated through either a sequential two step single electron indirect reduction process o 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 or a one step two electron direct reduction o 2 h 2 o 2 route during the cn photocatalytic process kim et al 2018 liu et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 obviously in either pathway h2o2 yield is highly dependent on the generation efficiency and the mobility of the photogenerated electrons in addition to the adsorption capability of o2 on the surface of cn catalyst as bcn presents the rapid recombination of electron hole pairs and low charge carrier mobility bcn exhibits a low photocatalytic degradation activity

wang et al lin et al 2019 found that forming crystalline cn ccn with fully condensed tri s triazine based structure can enhance the photogenerated charge carrier generation and mobility herein we aim to investigate the generation pathway of reactive oxygen species ross on ccn the ccn was synthesized via a kcl licl molten salt method various characterizations confirm the high crystalline nature with fully condensed tri s triazine based structure the as prepared ccn showed outstanding photocatalytic performance towards degrading ppcps under visible light irradiation the photocatalysis mechanism was further systematically studied from both experimental and computational aspects we propose a direct two electron reduction for h2o2 generation on ccn compared with a successive single electron reduction process on bcn we also evaluate the technical feasibility of ccn photocatalytic process in the real aquatic environment including treating ppcps at trace concentration range 20 μg l mixed with natural water matrixes mixed with complex contaminants and under natural sunlight irradiation this study offers a promising sustainable technique to treat the ppcps contaminated water 2

photocatalytic experiments were performed in an cel lb70 3 rotary photochemical reactor ceaulight in which a 350 w xe lamp with a 420 nm cut off filter was used as the visible light source in a typical experiment 50 mg of the photocatalyst was introduced into a quartz tube that contained 50 ml of 8 mg l ppcps which was stirred in the dark for 30 min to ensure the adsorption desorption

in texts s1 s2 and table s2 2 5 determination of ross during photocatalytic degradation the production of hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anion radicals o2 in the photocatalytic degradation

photogenerated hole h and photogenerated electron e respectively furthermore the formation of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in photocatalytic reaction suspension was detected via a fluorescence method with p hydroxyphenyl acetic acid pohpaa as the peroxide indicator wang et al 2014 detail detection method can be found in text s3 2 6 theoretical calculation based on density functional theory dft we used castep modulus in materials studio to optimize all configurations as well as to calculate the band structure reaction pathway and molecular orbital the exchange correlation interactions were described by generalized gradient approximation gga with perdew burke ernzerhof pbe functional perdew et al 1996 spin polarization was included in all calculations and a damped van der waals correction was incorporated using grimme s scheme to describe the non bonding interactions du et al 2012 norm conserving was used in all the pseudopotentials calculations 310 ev cutoff energy was used for the plane wave molecular orbital calculations of npx were conducted in the gaussian 09 program with the b3lyp 6 311g d p level the detailed calculation method is conveyed in the text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization physicochemical properties of the as prepared materials were systematically investigated powder x ray diffraction data are shown in fig 1 a bcn displays two characteristic diffraction peaks at 13 0 and 27 2 indexed to 100 and 002 crystal facets corresponding to the stacking of conjugated aromatic system and the in plane tri s triazine stacking structural packing motifs in the conjugated aromatic units respectively the 100 peak of ccn shifts from 13 0 to 8 0 corresponding to the increasing of layer distance from 0 680 nm to 1 104 nm which indicates the improvement on the crystallinity caused by the insert of li k ions into the layer planes lin et al 2016 compared with bcn fig s2 the high crystallinity of ccn is also confirmed by the clear lattice fringes observed from the hr tem images fig 1b the measured lattice spacing of 1 085 nm match that of the 100 plane which is consistent with the xrd analysis meanwhile the ccn revealed a smaller full width at half maximum than bcn indicating the well developed and more condensed crystal structure of ccn two distinct peaks at 163 1 and 156 5 ppm corresponding to n2 cn and cn3 units were observed in the solid state 13c nmr spectrum fig s3 which confirms the presence of tri s triazine units in the ccn the ft ir spectrum in fig s4 shows that the characteristic bands of ccn are similar to that of bcn indicating that the primary chemical structure of bcn is maintained after the molten salt treatment process moreover the peak located at 400 5 ev in the xps n1s spectra figs s5 and s6 corresponds to the terminal amino functions c n h become weaker after the molten salt treatment process indicating that a fully condensed tri s triazine based structure might be formed within the ccn framework the optical and electrochemical properties of the as prepared materials were then studied according to the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs fig s7 the light absorption ability of ccn is significantly enhanced the bandgaps of bcn and ccn are measured to be 2 67 ev and 2 72ev according to kubelka munk function as shown in the inset of fig s7 respectively the charge separation efficiency is investigated using the steady state and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy techniques with results shown in figs s8 and 1c the ccn exhibits a considerably weaker pl emission intensity compared with bcn implying that the charge separation efficiency is improved through forming crystalline structure the lifetime τ of the ccn determined from fitting time resolved fluorescence decay spectra fig 1c is 1 78256 ns compared to 5 31498 ns for bcn the shorter lifetime of photo induced carriers indicates a higher photocatalytic activity according to the prior report guo et al 2016 the electronic structures of the as prepared samples were investigated by room temperature epr spectroscopy as shown in fig s9 the single lorentzian lines of ccn shows stronger intensity than that of bcn indicating a high conductivity of ccn due to its highly ordered structure allowing for the improved delocalization of electrons liu et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 these results were further confirmed by photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra eis measurements as expected the photocurrent intensity of the ccn was significantly higher than that of bcn fig 1d which revealed the higher separation and transfer efficiencies of photogenerated electron hole pairs in ccn furthermore a significantly decreased diameter in semicircular nyquist plots was observed in ccn fig s10 compared to bcn which implied the superior electronic conductivity of ccn cao et al 2015 according to the above measurements the highly crystalline structure of ccn was confirmed in detail the high crystallinity enables an enhanced light absorption ability in addition to the improved charge generation separation and transport efficiency which is beneficial for the following phototcatalytic degradation performance 3 2 photocatalytic performance degradation of ppcps under visible light irradiation was used to gauge the photocatalytic activities of ccn materials toward the persistent organic pollutants with bcn serving as a reference catalyst as shown in fig 2a s11a and s11b ccn showed consistently higher photocatalytic activities than bcn toward the degradation of eight different ppcps pollutants including naproxen npx indomethacin idm diclofenac dcf carbamazepine cbz triclosan tcs ofloxacin ofx enrofloxacin enr sulfamethoxazole sme the enhancements in terms of photodegradation rate constant ranges from 7 1 times for enr to 2256 6 times for sme the removal rate varies from different kinds of ppcps molecules it might be due to their different chemical structures associated with different physicochemical properties and different adsorption abilities over the ccn materials the great versatility allows the treatment of a wide range of organic pollutants under optimized conditions to further study the photocatalytic kinetics mechanism and the degradation pathway npx 9 8 times with the moderate photodegradation activities on ccn and bcn was chosen as a probe pollutant compound as shown in fig 2 b the negligible self photolysis and hydrolysis confirmed the photochemical stability of the npx evidently the removal efficiency of npx by ccn 98 4 at the reaction time of 70 min under visible light irradiation was considerably higher than that of bcn 20 9 indicating that the tri s triazine based crystalline structure facilitates the photocatalytic reactions 3 3 photocatalysis mechanism 3 3 1 transformation mechanism of reactive oxygen species to investigate the photocatalysis mechanism ross involved in the ppcps photodegradation process were determined by electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy using dmpo as the spin trapping agent as indicated in fig 3 a and b negligible esr signals were observed under dark conditions the characteristic peaks for dmpo oh adducts quartet with 1 2 2 1 signal intensity and dmpo o2 adducts quartet with 1 1 1 1 signal intensity were presented under visible light irradiation suggesting the existence of oh and o2 in the ccn photocatalytic system in addition ccn photocatalytic system showed much stronger oh and o2 signals than bcn indicating that the crystalline structure allows the production of more ross to further quantitatively determine the contribution of various ross during the photocatalytic process ros quenching experiments were conducted in the bcn photocatalytic process the npx photodegradation was slightly accelerated upon the addition of ipa implying the negligible role of oh fig 3c and s12 on the contrary in the presence of bq k2cr2o7 and na2c2o4 the npx photodegradation inhibition rates reach to 52 11 47 37 and 26 32 respectively indicating that o2 derived from e played a vital role in the bcn photocatalytic system interestingly we found that ccn responded to the quenching experiments in a different manner as shown in fig 3c the degradation of npx were significantly suppressed in the presence of ipa 91 56 of inhibition rate indicating the predominant role of oh during the ccn photocatalytic process more importantly the addition of k2cr2o7 and bq also led to the inhibition of photocatalytic activity with inhibition rates of 60 24 and 93 98 while adding na2c2o4 only resulted in a slight enhancement on the npx degradation the results indicated that the oh might be generated from the conduction band electrons and or o2 rather than valence band holes on the ccn photocatalysts therefore we proposed that the predominant ross changed from o2 to oh due to the improvement on the cn crystallinity caused by the molten salt treatment process previous studies have confirmed that oh could be produced via the decomposition of h2o2 during the carbon nitride photocatalytic process cai et al 2019 li et al 2016 in order to explore the oh formation mechanism the photocatalytic h2o2 production ability over the as prepared bcn and ccn were measured by the fluorescence method as shown in fig 3d almost no h2o2 was detected in bcn suspensions under the visible light irradiation for 90 min however the crystalline ccn produces a significantly enhanced h2o2 yield with a maximum concentration of 3 2 μmol l compared with 0 2 μmol l for bcn at the same condition to better explain the formation process of h2o2 photogenerated electron transfer number has been detected via the analysis of the oxygen reduction reaction orr in the electrochemical rotating disk electrode rde the lsv curves of various electrodes in oxygen saturated electrolytes were shown in fig 3e s13a and s13b rotation speed ranging from 0 to 2000 rpm apparently the ccn catalysts showed higher cathodic current densities than bcn indicating that crystalline structure promoted the orr rates the relationship between current density and rotation speed at plateau currents can be described by koutecky levuch equation fig 3e and s13c where the electron transfer number n of bcn and ccn was calculated to be 1 5 and 2 4 respectively it suggests that the ccn is most likely to trigger a direct two electron orr to generate h2o2 while bcn predominate the single electron orrs to produce o2 the entire orr reaction pathway including i o2 adsorption ii ooh generation via coupling o2 with a proton and an electron and iii h2o2 formation was further simulated using dft calculations with the adsorption energy diagrams shown in fig 4 a and b in the first step the released energy associated with the adsorption of oxygen on ccn and bcn is 0 094 and 0 439 ev respectively subsequently the adsorbed o2 couples with a proton and an electron and transfers to ooh with the corresponding released energy of 0 313 and 0 734 ev on ccn and bcn respectively these two steps are both exothermic processes that can be carried out spontaneously in the third step additional protons and electrons are introduced to ccn and bcn to produce h2o2 it can be observed that ccn system shows a negligible adsorption energy of 0 012 ev which is much lower than in the bcn system 0 500 ev such low energy barrier is beneficial for the h2o2 generation on ccn material which agrees well with our experimental observations to get a deeper understanding of the generation of h2o2 on ccn the projected density of states pdos and orbitals of ooh adsorbed on the ccn and bcn were calculated it could be observed that there is hybridization between the orbits of s s s p p p in both systems and forms the σ s σ s σ p π p π p bonds fig 4c s14 s15 and s16 those bonds play important roles for the whole system as indicated by the pdos in addition spin down π p orbital in ccn system is half empty at fermi level and another empty band is at 1 5 ev which prefers to accept external electrons and induce the third reaction step to take place however bcn system shows much smaller empty bands and much higher energy than ccn system implying that the bcn system exhibits a weaker capability to accept electrons therefore the last step of producing h2o2 reaction is theoretically difficult in bcn system while almost no barrier for the electron transfer from spin up π p to spin down π p orbital in ccn system in the third step of reaction pathway the specific values of bond length in molecules before and after the addition of protons and electrons to produce h2o2 are listed in table s3 for ccn systems the change of o h bond length is about 0 030 å while the variation range on bcn from 0 139 to 0 165 å the bond length change in bcn is roughly 5 times that in ccn system such a large structure change would consume high energy which further explains the non spontaneous process of producing h2o2 on bcn finally the photocatalytic generated h2o2 could be decomposed leading to the formation of oh both experimental and computational results revealed the vital roles of o2 during the npx photocatalytic degradation process to further verify the process photodegradation of npx were conducted under the n2 or o2 conditions fig s17 a dramatic decrease in the activity was observed under the atmosphere of n2 while a significant increase was noted under the atmosphere of o2 then the temperature programmed desorption of o2 o2 tpd was performed to investigate the o2 adsorption capacity of the as prepared catalysts as shown in fig 3f bcn displays almost no oxygen desorption peaks whereas the ccn exhibits two oxygen desorption peaks at 167 c and 452 c the results reveal that the high crystallization tri s triazine based structure of ccn facilitates the o2 adsorption process thereby enhance the generation of oh radicals 3 3 2 mineralization and transformation pathways the photodegradation pathway of npx over the ccn catalysts was monitored using the uplc q tof ms analysis figs s18 and s19 shows the tentative structures chromatograms and mass spectrum analysis of eight major degradation byproducts the toc removal efficiencies fig s20 of npx were subsequently examined upon the visible light irradiation for 70 min toc removal efficiency reaches 58 revealing that the npx and its degradation intermediates could be completely mineralized under a continuous solar irradiation in order to further examine the primary reactive sites on the npx molecules gaussian calculations were carried out based on the computation of the frontier electron densities feds and atom point charges it was observed that c 1 c 2 c 5 c 9 and c 10 revealed high electron density higher fed2 homo fed2 lumo value indicating that the naphthalene ring of npx was likely to be attacked by oh while the c 24 with more positive point charge are likely to be attacked by o2 therefore three major pathways including hydroxylation decarboxylation and demethoxylation reactions of npx in ccn photocatalytic process were proposed in fig 5 in pathway 1 the naphthalene ring of npx would undergo the electrophilic adduct reaction by oh attack resulting in the formation of hydroxylation products m z 262 pathway 2 was initiated by the cleavage of the carboxylic group thereby producing the carbon centered radicals t1 subsequently t1 could be attacked by o2 to form m z 218 with a further oxidization process to produce m z 184 and m z 170 t1 could also react with h to give a m z 186 or be attacked by oh to form m z 200 the pathway 3 began with the hydroxylation of the methoxy group on the naphthalene ring with the formation of m z 216 and m z 170 all the intermediates would undergo a further oxidation giving rise to the ring opening products co2 and h2o 3 3 3 potential photocatalytic mechanisms based on the above results the entire photocatalysis mechanism of the ccn materials are proposed below under the sunlight irradiation photogenerated electron holes pairs would be formed as the position of the conduction band 1 41 ev fig s21 was negative than the standard reduction potential of o2 o2 0 33 ev o2 could be easily generated via capturing conduction band e by the dissolved oxygen molecules however the photogenerated holes are inactive to oxidize oh h2o into oh because the valence band position of ccn is more negative than that of oh h2o 2 27 ev vs nhe fortunately the high crystalline tri s triazine based structure of ccn would enhance the o2 adsorption and promote the one step two electron orr reduction pathway thereby leading to the enhance production of oh finally the generated ross particularly oh would attack ppcps molecules leading to their decomposition and mineralization eqs 6 13 6

pollution products h 2 o c o 2 3 4 environmental implication the stability and reusability of a photocatalyst is a key parameter toward its environmental applications herein cycling experiment was first conducted to assess the stability of ccn as shown in fig s22 and 84 88 of photocatalytic activity toward the npx degradation could be maintained after four successive cycles furthermore the xrd pattern and ft ir spectra of the used ccn remained unchanged after catalytic reactions suggesting the robust stability of ccn the feasibility of the ccn photocatalytic oxidation system was then evaluated by the decomposition of npx under various ambient water matrices chaabane et al 2007 conceicao et al 2000 as shown in fig 6 a surprisingly the photocatalytic oxidation degradation of npx showed remarkable enhancement catalytic activity under tap water pearl river water wwtp water and south china sea water this promotion might be attributed to the combined effects of coexisting constituents such as transition metals dissolved organic matter etc as listed in table s1 to further investigate the effect of water constituents degradation of npx was performed in the solution containing of different the inorganic anions cations as well as organic matters as depicted in fig 6b no obvious influence of the photocatalytic degradation of npx were observed in the presence of cl so4 2 hco3 no3 and ha in contrast divalent cations mg2 ca2 particularly the ca2 significantly enhanced the removal efficiency of npx which might be due to the fact that ca2 and mg2 could affect the absorption for npx on the surface of ccn chen and xu 2012 in addition due to the scavenging of the conduction band electrons cu2 showed a significant inhibition on the photocatalytic degradation of npx as another vital parameter in the water environment the effect of the ph value on npx degradation was studied fig 6c it was found that ccn photocatalytic system exhibited an excellent efficiency for npx under a wide ph range even in a strong acidic or alkaline medium to further explain the different reaction rate constants under various ph values the zeta potential of ccn was detected as shown in fig s23 ccn possessed the negative polarity on its surface with the zeta potentials of 15 1 21 4 24 5 27 5 and 34 5 mv when ph was 3 5 7 9 and 11 respectively as the dissociation constant pka of npx was 4 2 an electrostatic attraction between ccn and npx might have occurred when the ph of the solution was below 4 2 which led to the strong absorption affinity between ccn and npx thus accelerating the activity of the ccn system on the contrary an intense electrostatic exclusion might appear when ph was 11 resulting in the modesty photocatalytic activity this superior property of the npx degradation might be attributed to the strong π π interactions with the ccn aguedach et al 2008 wang et al 2018a overall the sufficient degradation of ppcps in natural water matrices confirmed the suitability of ccn photocatalytic system to ameliorate concerns with ppcps under the ambient water conditions it was reported that the real concentration of ppcps in the natural environment ranges from ng l to μg l guo et al 2017 to test whether ccn photocatalytic system could be applied for the remediation of ppcps with trace concentration degradation of npx was performed under the low initial concentration 20 μg l fig 6d using the solid phase extraction method we found that all the npx molecules could be completely decomposed within 30 min of visible light irradiation implying that the ccn photocatalytic system could be applied for the treatment of trace concentration of ppcps considering the complex constitutes of ppcps in the environmental water matrices photocatalytic degradation of the mixed ppcps pollutants including npx idm dcf cbz tcs ofx enr sme has been performed to verify the universality and practical feasibility of the ccn photocatalytic system as shown in fig 6e all the mixed ppcps could be significantly decomposed upon the visible light irradiation detailly npx idm dcf cbz tcs ofx enr and sme showed the removal rates of 79 5 100 100 100 97 2 84 2 95 1 and 79 4 respectively following 150 min of visible light irradiation in the ideal case the photocatalytic water treatment process is powered by natural solar light we therefore used the natural sunlight as the energy source to evaluate the feasibility of the ccn photocatalytic in practical application shows in fig 6f interestingly ccn materials displayed an excellent catalytic activity toward the degradation of npx under natural sunlight irradiation which indicated that this system may be effectively utilized for the remediation of ppcps under natural sunlight condition 4 conclusion in summary we fabricated a highly crystalline carbon nitride catalyst with the fully condensed tri s triazine structure via a molten salt method the tri s triazine based structure of ccn can enhance the generation and mobility of photogenerated charge carrier the crystalline structure facilitates the o2 absorption process and enables a direct oxygen reduction reaction involving a one step two electron pathway as a result the ccn materials produces a much higher h2o2 generation efficiency compared with bcn confirmed by both experimental and computational analysis the h2o2 finally converted into oh radicals to decompose the ppcps in the water samples more importantly the ccn catalysts could be used to treat ppcps at the trace concentration range in the natural water matrixes under the natural sunlight irradiation and in the mixed pollutants also the ccn catalysts exhibits excellent stability this work provided a new strategy in producing a high performance photocatalyst for the treatment of ppcps contaminated water and it advances our understanding of adjusting ros generation pathway via improving the crystallinity of the catalyst declaration of competing interest the

17872,quantifying metabolic rates in lakes and other aquatic ecosystems is a complex task as methods are continually evolving and are not currently standardized recently peeters et al presented a valuable simulated dataset that advances the field by comparing the strengths and limitations of individual and combined metabolic techniques the authors conclude that calculating metabolic rates from point sampling and mass balancing of surface water oxygen concentration and isotope composition is flawed because the technique does not capture sub daily patterns of metabolic variability which they argue invalidates past applications and interpretations these conclusions are inconsistent with how the method has been used and are based on a biased construction of scenarios and interpretation of model results especially because their parameterization of the stable isotopic model employs input values that appear unrepresentative of most lake conditions here we establish that 1 empirical evidence supports the isotopic approach s suitability to approximate daily or longer metabolic patterns in most lakes 2 the authors own simulations show agreement between metabolic estimates from point isotopic measurements and average metabolic rates under most scenarios 3 the authors invalidation of isotopic measurements are based on the most extreme model deviations observed in simulated hypereutrophic environments while we welcome a critical evaluation of the isotopic approach we argue that isotopic model uncertainty needs to be placed within an appropriate context we emphasize that isotopic sampling and steady state metabolic modelling has a key role to play in constraining metabolic patterns in the global lake landscape but that the research questions addressed with the method need to be commensurate with the limitations and uncertainties of the approach keywords aquatic metabolism stable isotopes oxygen lake gross primary production respiration 1 background estimates of aquatic metabolism including rates of gross primary production gpp ecosystem respiration r and net ecosystem production nep gpp r provide critical insights into ecosystem functioning techniques for quantifying different aspects of metabolism across distinct spatio temporal scales are diverse and there is no consensus as to a single best methodological approach staehr et al 2012 peeters et al 2019 used simulations to explore the utility of lake metabolic measurements based on lower frequency e g once daily sampling and mass balancing of oxygen concentrations and stable isotope pools they concluded that rates estimated from oxygen isotope point sampling and a steady state assumption are unreliable invalidating conclusions based on this approach below we argue that the authors have misinterpreted methodological timescales and we revisit their simulations to demonstrate that mid day sampling and daily metabolic averages do agree under most conditions we highlight that steady state isotopic results align with the results from independent empirical data and argue for its continued application in studies of aquatic metabolism 2 timescales of applicability biogeochemists commonly report rates of elemental cycling in units of mass flux per day even when measurements occur over shorter or longer timeframes it is widely understood that daily averaged metabolic rates summarize shorter term variability and cannot be used to infer patterns occurring over shorter timescales given this general understanding it is unclear why peeters and coauthors disregard the steady state isotopic technique based on its inability to detect sub daily metabolic patterns in our work we have restricted our use of the technique to approximate daily rates e g bogard and del giorgio 2016 bogard et al 2017 2019a 2020 and have been explicit about making no attempt to infer metabolic patterns over shorter timescales 3 placing data simulations into context peeters et al used a combination of field derived and modelled data in a 5 day comparison see their fig 2 it is generally clear how the data used in the diel modelling were assembled but parametrization of the isotopic model is not no field isotopic data were used to approximate dissolved o2 δ18o values rather values appear randomly assigned spanning 25 to 51 permil across modelled lakes this range is inconsistent with reported field data for open lake waters such elevated isotopic values are only recorded in small subsets of lakes under ice at the end of winter under conditions of anoxia extreme do depletion and isotopic enrichment bogard et al 2019a in reality isotopic values of do are intimately connected to atmospheric and water isotopic composition endmembers in the model consequently the do isotopic input values were likely incompatible with known atmospheric signatures and water isotopic values in the study the implications for assigning these extreme and unrepresentative isotopic values are unclear and must be explored to effectively compare isotopic and diel do model outputs of gpp and r 4 mid day sampling generally robust in their fig 2j o peeters et al 2019 focus on extremes of gpp or r departure from known daily averages an approach that overlooks that modelled and known rates converge around mid day when lakes are typically sampled e g bogard et al 2019a 2020 the authors emphasized only the most extreme deviance 250 at a single time in the most hypereutrophic simulated environment ignoring the considerable fraction of the day when simulations yielded general agreement between methods we extracted hourly datapoints from their line plots using online software at http www graphreader com and calculated the percent deviation of point 18o modelled gpp and r relative to

17872,quantifying metabolic rates in lakes and other aquatic ecosystems is a complex task as methods are continually evolving and are not currently standardized recently peeters et al presented a valuable simulated dataset that advances the field by comparing the strengths and limitations of individual and combined metabolic techniques the authors conclude that calculating metabolic rates from point sampling and mass balancing of surface water oxygen concentration and isotope composition is flawed because the technique does not capture sub daily patterns of metabolic variability which they argue invalidates past applications and interpretations these conclusions are inconsistent with how the method has been used and are based on a biased construction of scenarios and interpretation of model results especially because their parameterization of the stable isotopic model employs input values that appear unrepresentative of most lake conditions here we establish that 1 empirical evidence supports the isotopic approach s suitability to approximate daily or longer metabolic patterns in most lakes 2 the authors own simulations show agreement between metabolic estimates from point isotopic measurements and average metabolic rates under most scenarios 3 the authors invalidation of isotopic measurements are based on the most extreme model deviations observed in simulated hypereutrophic environments while we welcome a critical evaluation of the isotopic approach we argue that isotopic model uncertainty needs to be placed within an appropriate context we emphasize that isotopic sampling and steady state metabolic modelling has a key role to play in constraining metabolic patterns in the global lake landscape but that the research questions addressed with the method need to be commensurate with the limitations and uncertainties of the approach keywords aquatic metabolism stable isotopes oxygen lake gross primary production respiration 1 background estimates of aquatic metabolism including rates of gross primary production gpp ecosystem respiration r and net ecosystem production nep gpp r provide critical insights into ecosystem functioning techniques for quantifying different aspects of metabolism across distinct spatio temporal scales are diverse and there is no consensus as to a single best methodological approach staehr et al 2012 peeters et al 2019 used simulations to explore the utility of lake metabolic measurements based on lower frequency e g once daily sampling and mass balancing of oxygen concentrations and stable isotope pools they concluded that rates estimated from oxygen isotope point sampling and a steady state assumption are unreliable invalidating conclusions based on this approach below we argue that the authors have misinterpreted methodological timescales and we revisit their simulations to demonstrate that mid day sampling and daily metabolic averages do agree under most conditions we highlight that steady state isotopic results align with the results from independent empirical data and argue for its continued application in studies of aquatic metabolism 2 timescales of applicability biogeochemists commonly report rates of elemental cycling in units of mass flux per day even when measurements occur over shorter or longer timeframes it is widely understood that daily averaged metabolic rates summarize shorter term variability and cannot be used to infer patterns occurring over shorter timescales given this general understanding it is unclear why peeters and coauthors disregard the steady state isotopic technique based on its inability to detect sub daily metabolic patterns in our work we have restricted our use of the technique to approximate daily rates e g bogard and del giorgio 2016 bogard et al 2017 2019a 2020 and have been explicit about making no attempt to infer metabolic patterns over shorter timescales 3 placing data simulations into context peeters et al used a combination of field derived and modelled data in a 5 day comparison see their fig 2 it is generally clear how the data used in the diel modelling were assembled but parametrization of the isotopic model is not no field isotopic data were used to approximate dissolved o2 δ18o values rather values appear randomly assigned spanning 25 to 51 permil across modelled lakes this range is inconsistent with reported field data for open lake waters such elevated isotopic values are only recorded in small subsets of lakes under ice at the end of winter under conditions of anoxia extreme do depletion and isotopic enrichment bogard et al 2019a in reality isotopic values of do are intimately connected to atmospheric and water isotopic composition endmembers in the model consequently the do isotopic input values were likely incompatible with known atmospheric signatures and water isotopic values in the study the implications for assigning these extreme and unrepresentative isotopic values are unclear and must be explored to effectively compare isotopic and diel do model outputs of gpp and r 4 mid day sampling generally robust in their fig 2j o peeters et al 2019 focus on extremes of gpp or r departure from known daily averages an approach that overlooks that modelled and known rates converge around mid day when lakes are typically sampled e g bogard et al 2019a 2020 the authors emphasized only the most extreme deviance 250 at a single time in the most hypereutrophic simulated environment ignoring the considerable fraction of the day when simulations yielded general agreement between methods we extracted hourly datapoints from their line plots using online software at http www graphreader com and calculated the percent deviation of point 18o modelled gpp and r relative to

17873,coronaviruses cov are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases as middle east respiratory syndrome mers cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 has become a public health emergency worldwide sars cov 2 the virus responsible for covid 19 is spread by human to human transmission via droplets or direct contact however since sars cov 2 as well as other coronaviruses has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients the possibility of fecal oral including waterborne transmission need to be investigated and clarified this scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on cov in water environments a literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases pubmed embase and web science core collection this comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review in detail the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas 1 cov persistence survival in waters 2 cov occurrence in water environments 3 methods for recovery of cov from waters the data available suggest that i cov seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants like chlorine ii cov appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission iii temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23 c 25 c than at 4 c iv there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking water v further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric non enveloped viruses from water environments the evidence based

coronavirus through water keywords coronavirus sars cov 2 water disinfection survival occurrence method 1 introduction faecal contamination of water supplies has been historically recognised as a risk for human health water can provide a vehicle for pathogen spread creating the conditions for outbreaks or sporadic cases of infection human pathogenic viruses are often detected in water environments and are deemed to be responsible for a considerable proportion of waterborne diseases hamza and bibby 2019 haramoto et al 2018 la rosa et al 2012 moreira and bondelind rusinol and girones 2017 who 2017 viruses of concern for their potential waterborne transmission belong mainly to the group of enteric viruses a diverse group of non enveloped viruses which can multiply in the gastrointestinal tract of humans they can be mostly responsible of gastrointestinal illness but also of a wide spectrum of other diseases such as conjunctivitis respiratory symptoms viral hepatitis infections of the central nervous system the most important waterborne enteric viruses belong to the families caliciviridae norovirus picornaviridae enterovirus and hepatitis a virus and adenoviridae adenovirus who 2017 these viruses are often excreted at high titres in the feces and occasionally at lower concentrations in urines of infected humans rusinol and girones 2017 they have also been detected from virtually all types of water wastewater seawater fresh waters groundwater and drinking water and have been associated with drinking and recreational water outbreaks bonadonna and la rosa 2019 gall et al 2015 la rosa et al 2012 moreira and bondelind rusinol and girones 2017 conversely enveloped viruses are structurally dissimilar to the enteric non enveloped viruses and are believed to behave differently in water environments wigginton et al 2015 this group of viruses includes families such as orthomyxoviridae es influenza viruses paramyxoviridae measles virus mumps virus respiratory syncytial virus etc herpesviridae coronaviridae and several others viruses among the enveloped viruses coronaviruses cov order nidovirales family coronaviridae subfamily coronavirinae are single

their primary transmission mode is person to person contact through respiratory droplets generated by breathing sneezing coughing etc and contact direct contact with an infected subject or indirect contact trough hand mediated transfer of the virus from contaminated fomites to the mouth nose or eyes waterborne transmission has never been demonstrated in humans however detection of hcov in the feces of infected patients has been reported esper et al 2010 jevšnik et al 2013 risku et al 2010 vabret et al 2006 suggesting the fecal oral route may contribute to hcov transmission in 2003 the sars cov was detected in the feces of infected patients isakbaeva et al 2004 and during an outbreak in a residential complex of amoy garden in hong kong transmission by aerosolized wastewater was suspected mckinney et al 2006 in late 2019 a new acute respiratory disease known as covid 19 sustained by a novel coronavirus sars cov 2 gorbalenya et al 2020 emerged in wuhan china and following global spread of the disease the outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 and the world health organization who on 11 february 2020 announced a name for the new coronavirus disease covid 19 on march 11 who upgraded the status of the covid 19 outbreak from epidemic to pandemic coronavirus virion is enveloped spherical and about 120 nm in diameter envelope proteins are involved in several aspects of the virus life cycle such as assembly envelope formation and pathogenesis inside the envelope is the helical capsid containing nucleoprotein and the rna genome fig 1 shows the virion structure of sars cov sars cov 2 the 25 32 kb genome of sars cov 2 is organized in two large open reading frames orf1a and orf1b located at the 5 end coding for replicase polyproteins followed in the terminal one third of the genome by a region encoding for the structural proteins spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid protein fig 2 shows the linear ssrna genome of sars cov2 as for other respiratory hcov the main vehicle of transmission of sara cov 2 are droplets generated by breathing sneezing coughing etc and contact direct contact with an infected subject or indirect contact trough hand mediated transfer of the virus from contaminated fomites to the mouth nose or eyes in the rapidly evolving picture of the scientific knowledge on covid 19 and sars cov 2 some studies have reported the presence fragments of viral rna in feces or anal swab of infected patients holshue et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 transmission of covid 19 through the fecal oral route however has not been demonstrated nor occurrence of sars cov 2 in water environments has been proved to date information on the presence quantitative levels and survival in water environments of coronaviruses of interest for human health are indeed limited and few studies approached development and optimization of methods to concentrate cov or other enveloped viruses from wastewater biosolids surface waters or other water types see table 3 the present review summarizes the current state of knowledge on coronaviruses of interest for human health in water environments with an emphasis on their occurrence and persistence and on concentration methods for their detection in different water matrices the reported outcomes are aimed to improve knowledge on transmission pathways and possible infection hazards related to poor drinking water and sanitation management additionally research gaps on methodologies for detection with focus on concentration methods enveloped viruses are specifically examined to strengthen their monitoring in water media 2 methods an electronic search of available literature was run on 23 february 2020 search was conducted using the electronic databases pubmed embase and web science core collection with no restriction for publication date or language the search strategy included terms related to the virus group and the environmental matrices of interest see table 1 a total of 4382 articles were retrieved by the search and duplicates n 776 were automatically removed using the endnote reference manager software online using the rayyan review platform https rayyan qcri org welcome titles and abstracts of the retained 3606 articles were screened and assessed for eligibility by two independent reviewers glr and es and the disagreements were resolved by discussion between the reviewers and a third referee lb based on the objective of the study 3543 records were eliminated as not relevant full text screening was undertaken on the retained 63 articles and further 51 articles were excluded as either i unrelated to cov in water environments ii records duplicating results retrieved by earlier articles linked

or survival of cov in waters were retrieved table 2 the articles were related to seeding experiments in which sars cov human cov 229e or surrogate animal cov tgev fipv or murine hepatitis virus mhv were used to spike different water types wang et al 2005a casanova et al 2009 gundy et al 2009 ye et al 2016 wang and coworkers studied the persistence of sars cov in water hospital wastewater domestic sewage and dechlorinated tap water and in feces and urine wang et al 2005a in the study the effect of sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide in inactivating sars cov escherichia coli and the enterobacteria phage f2 spiked in wastewater was evaluated sars cov was detected in hospital wastewater domestic sewage and tap water for 2 days at 20 c and up to 14 days at 4 c thus demonstrating temperature strongly influences viral persistence indeed it has been universally demonstrated that higher temperatures are associated with rapid inactivation of enteric viruses and temperature is recognised as the most influential factor for viral survival in water due to increased denaturation of proteins and activity of extracellular enzymes pinon and vialette 2018 wang and coworkers wang et al 2005a highlighted that sars cov persists 3 days in stools and 17 days in urine stored at 20 c on the other hand at a lower temperature 4 c they persist for 17 days the same study showed that chlorine was more effective than chlorine dioxide in inactivating e coli f2 phage and sars cov and a free residual chlorine of 0 5 mg l from chlorine or 2 19 mg l from chlorine dioxide in wastewater ensured complete inactivation of sars cov in the experimental conditions of the study sars cov was inactivated completely in presence of 10 mg l chlorine and a minimum contact time of 10 min or in 1 min using 20 mg l chlorine under the same conditions e coli and f2 phage were not inactivated effectively this findings are of specific relevance since according to the 4th edition of the world health organization s guidelines for drinking water quality viruses are generally more resistant to free chlorine than bacteria specifically moderate resistance for viruses and low for the vast majority of bacteria who 2017 the viruses considered of concern for water in who guidelines however are principally enteric viruses familes adenoviridae astroviridae caliciviridae hepeviridae picornaviridae and reoviridae which are as previously reported non enveloped viruses it is well known that these viruses are more resistant to environmental conditions water treatments and disinfectants than enveloped viruses like coronavirus as lysis of the viral envelope leads to the loss of functional receptors required for infection of susceptible cells wigginton et al 2015 according to the results of wang 2005a sars cov resistance to chlorine is lower than for bacteria it follows that the current water disinfection practices drinking water wastewater water from swimming pool effective against non enveloped viruses and bacteria are expected to be effective also towards enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses the study of casanova et al 2009 evaluated the survival of two surrogate coronaviruses tgev transmissible gastroenteritis virus a porcine coronavirus and mhv murine hepatitis virus in reagent grade water lake water and settled human sewage two temperatures were evaluated over 6 weeks room temperature 23 25 c and 4 c in general in all the water tested the titer of infectious virus declined more rapidly at 25 c than at 4 c confirming that temperature is an important factor affecting viral survival in water at 25 c the time required for a 99 9 reduction t99 9 in reagent grade water was 33 days and 26 days for tgev and mhv respectively while in pasteurized settled sewage it was 14 days and 10 days respectively on the other hand no significant decrease of tgev and mhv was reported in reagent grade water at 4 c after 49 days and limited reduction was obtained at the same temperature in lake water after 14 days based on these results the authors suggest that contaminated water may be a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated however it is important to underline that the surrogate animal coronaviruses used in this study are responsible for gastrointestinal or hepatic diseases in animals and may therefore display a different resistance behaviour compared to respiratory human coronaviruses this could explain the greater resistance and longer survival displayed by cov in this work compared to the study of wang and colleagues 2005a moreover the use of different cell lines and growth media in these persistence studies might have contribute to measurement uncertainty gundy et al 2019 investigated the survival of a human coronavirus hcov 229e and of an animal coronavirus fipv feline infectious peritonitis virus in tap water filtered and non filtered and wastewater primary and activated sludge effluents comparing results with those of poliovirus 1 pv 1 sabin attenuated strain lsc 2ab in wastewater the tested cov died off quite rapidly with a t99 9 of 2 77 3 54 days at 23 c significantly the pv 1 lasted 2 to 3 times longer than cov did requiring 10 9 days for a comparable reduction in primary wastewater and 5 7 days in secondary effluents in tap water cov reduction was slower than in wastewaters at 23 c the t99 9 was 12 1 12 5 days for hcov 229e and fipv while at 4 c the same reduction was predicted by modelling to be achivable over 100 days these yields highlight once again that virus survival decreases with increasing temperature similarly to the results obtained on wastewater pv 1 survived six times longer than cov in both filtered and unfiltered tap water confirming the observation that non enveloped viruses display higher resistance in water enviroments compared to enveloped viruses another important finding of the study was that cov inactivation was faster in filtered tap water than unfiltered tap water suggesting that suspended solids in water can provide protection for viruses adsorbed to these particles finally a more recent study ye et al 2016 investigated the survival and partitioning of two enveloped viruses mhv and pseudomonas phage φ6 and of two non enveloped viruses bacteriophages ms2 and t3 in untreated municipal wastewater unpasteurized and pasteurized wastewater were spiked with the viral stocks and were then incubated at 25 c or 10 c to mimic typical summer and winter wastewater temperatures inactivation proceeded faster for the enveloped viruses in unpasteurized wastewaters at 25 c the time to reach a 90 reduction t90 was 13 h for mhv and 7 h phage φ6 compared to a predicted value of 121 h for the non enveloped phage ms2 at 10 c the inactivation kinetics of both mhv and φ6 were once again significantly slower than at environmental temperatures with a t90 of 28 36 h in pasteurized wastewater both mhv and phage φ6 lost infectivity at a significantly slower rate compared to unpasteurized wastewater t90 of 19 h for mhv and 53 h for phage φ6 at 25 c possibly due to the reduction of bacterial extracellular enzyme activity and the absence of protozoan and metazoan predation in pasteurized samples indeed it was demonstrated that the presence of an indigenous microbial population has a negative impact on virus survival pinon and vialette 2018 rzezutka and cook 2004 finally in the same study ye et al reported that up to 26 of the enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater that means that a reduction of enveloped viruses in wastewaters is provided by solid settling 3 2 occurrence of coronavirus in water environments two reports specifically addressing detection in water environments of cov of interest for human health and three metagenomic virome studies were retrieved through literature search table 3 sewage discharges from two hospitals in beijing china hosting sars patients during the 2003 outbreak were analyzed with the aim to investigate whether sewage may be a possible route of transmission for sars cov wang et al 2005b both cell culture and rt pcr were utilized to ascertain viability and detect the virus in sewage while viral genome was repeatedly detected in hospital sewage before disinfection 10 10 wastewater samples and in some cases after disinfection 3 10 samples infectious sars cov was never detected in the tested samples possible explanation of authors includes viral inactivation by disinfectants high concentration of disinfectants were used after a patient had bowel movements low viral concentration or loss of infectivity by unknown factors during the concentration process in the second study specifically addressing cov detection in water blanco et al 2019 investigated the occurrence of these viruses in surface waters of wadi hanifa riyadh using a broad range rt pcr for the detection of alpha and betacoronavirus of the 21 tested samples only one sample was positive for cov upon sequence analysis the positive sample was found to be closely related to a novel rodent shrew specific clade within lineage a of alphacoronavirus reported in asia and europe three metagenomic studies have detected cov in water matrices two focused on class b biosolids from wastewater treatment facility bibby et al 2011 bibby peccia 2013 and one on different type of water river lake reservoir alexyuk et al 2017 the study of bibby and coworkers identified a large variety of both enveloped and non enveloped viruses in biosolids including coronavirus herpesvirus torque teno virus and parechovirus interestingly all these groups of viruses were highly represented in compared to adenovirus which have been for long time considered the most abundant viral genus in biosolids bibby et al 2011 in detail 10 cov sequences were identified nine of which related to hcov 229e and one to hcov hku1 two years later another paper from the same authors described the diversity of viruses in sewage sludge samples influents and effluents with comparable results emerging viruses such as coronavirus klassevirus and cosavirus were detected in abundance in the sample bibby peccia 2013 coronaviruses were detected in 83 of samples and coronavirus hku1 was the second most prevalent rna virus interestingly coronavirus showed a higher relative abundance in influent samples compared to effluent ones finally alexyuk et al 2017 studied the viromes sampled in surface water river lake and water reservoir while the majority of the sequences were related to autochthonous viruses typical for aquatic ecosystems allochthonous viruses such families as coronaviridae reoviridae and herpesviridae were also detected suggesting anthropogenic pollution of the three selected water environments in detail coronaviridae were detected in all of the three environments ranging from 0 002 to 0 009 of the total sequences depending on sample to complete the picture on the occurrence of coronavirus in water environments after the initial submission of this scoping review while the paper was under review novel papers some of which published as preprint have demonstrated the occurrence of sars cov 2 in municipal wastewaters worldwide and specifically in the netherlands medema et al 2020 in massachusetts wu et al 2020 in australia ahmed et al 2020 france wurtzer et al 2020 and italy la rosa et al 2020 submitted 3 3 methods for concentration of enveloped viruses from water matrices five studies table 4 investigated concentration methods for cov in waters and the associated recovery efficiency the first study investigating cov recovery from waters was published more than 30 years ago collomb et al 1986 using for the spiking experiments a bovine enteric coronavirus and assessing a concentration procedure based on viral adsorption on glass powder at acid ph followed by alkaline ph elution since cov is sensitive to acid ph 3 and alkaline ph ph 10 adsorption was optimal at ph 3 3 and elution at ph 9 under such conditions the overall efficiency of the concentration method appeared to be between 24 and 28 unfortunately since it was not possible to retrieve the full text of this publication no further information beside those included in the abstract could be reported following the sars outbreak of 2003 wang et al 2005c performed a study to evaluate the recovery from spiked sewage of sars cov and of a surrogate virus bacteriophage f2 the concentration procedure foresaw the use of positively charged electropositive filter media particle silica gel plus al oh 3 packed in a glass column according to a protocol previously described by li et al 1998 for enteric viruses hospital sewage and domestic sewage 100 ml were spiked with sars cov and phage f2 passed through the glass column eluted from the filter media with 3 nutrient broth ph 7 2 and then polyethylene glycol peg precipitated the procedure gave recoveries of sars cov ranging from 0 sewage from a housing estate to 21 4 sewage from the hospital with an average of 1 02 the recovery of phage f2 under the same conditions were significantly higher from 33 6 to more than 100 this method therefore seemed more suitable for the concentration of enveloped viruses in agreement with the initial study proposing its use that showed recoveries of enterovirus and hepatitis a virus from tap water ranging from 88 7 to 96 0 li et al 1998 ye et al 2016 evaluated three methods for separating and concentrating viruses from the liquid fraction of municipal wastewater i peg precipitation ii ultracentrifugation iii ultrafiltration with centrifugal devices ye et al 2016 wastewater 250 ml for peg precipitation and ultrafiltration and 60 ml for ultracentrifugation was spiked with the rodent coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv and with the non enveloped phage ms2 low mean recoveries 5 were achieved for both mhv and ms2 with the ultracentrifugation method this result was suggested to be related to virus inactivation by the high g force of the ultracentrifugation recovery of mhv was low 5 also with the peg precipitation method whose performance for ms2 concentration was instead significantly higher 43 1 finally the optimized ultrafiltration protocol adopted in the study provided the highest recoveries for both viruses 25 1 for mhv and 55 6 for phage ms2 results of ye and colleagues suggested that the peg precipitation method which is effective at recovering non enveloped viruses from water samples may be not optimal for recovering infective enveloped viruses while ultrafiltration could be successfully applied for recovering cov however in this study only small volumes of wastewater were tested using centrifugal ultrafilters since viruses in water matrices may occur in very low numbers there is a need for analytical methods suitable to process large volumes of water it was therefore concluded by the authors that further progress could be made through the optimization of hollow fiber ultrafilters and tangential flow ultrafiltration to allow concentration of cov in waters from larger volumes of water abd elmaksoud and coworkers 2014 measured the effectiveness of glass wool filtration to simultaneously concentrate a variety of waterborne viral and bacterial pathogens typically found in runoff from agricultural fields using dairy manure as fertilizer viruses of bovine origin were used to spike 20 l of dechlorinated tap water including bovine coronavirus bocov bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2 bvdv1 and bvdv2 bovine rotavirus group a borv and poliovirus 3 sabin moreover e coli o157 nm and campylobacter jejuni were selected as bacterial pathogen three water turbidity levels were evaluated prepared by mixing dried agricultural soil into the 20 l of water after glass wool filtration elution was performed with 3 beef extract glycine buffer ph 9 5 followed by flocculation with peg 8000 recovered organisms were enumerated by qpcr results showed that glass wool filtration is a cost effective method for the concentration of several waterborne pathogens simultaneously in details the average recoveries across the different turbidity levels tested were 18 1 for bocov 22 1 for borv 15 6 and 19 7 for bvdv1 and bvdv2 respectively higher recovery efficiencies were obtained for the non enveloped virus poliovirus 3 57 9 and for the bacterial microorganisms e coli o157 nm 54 8 and c jejuni 32 7 however the authors advised to use caution in the interpretation of these comparative results since the quantity of pathogens used for spiking varied for the different microorganisms precluding a clear differentiation of the effects on recovery efficiency of seeding quantities and pathogen type blanco et al 2019 used adsorption to glass wool followed by elution with alkaline buffer and subsequent secondary concentration through peg 6000 precipitation the viruses used for the experimental procedures were hepatitis a virus hav non enveloped and the porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev large volumes of water 5 l and 50 l were used for method optimization and performance characterization several steps of the elution procedure were modified compared to other published glass wool protocols to improve the recovery of tgev and virus recoveries were ascertained by real time qpcr recovery of the initial experiments 5 l of water adsorption to the positively charged glass wool matrix elution with glycine beef extract buffer at ph 9 5 with 10 min of contact showed that tgev efficiently adsorbed onto the glass wool attachment of 57 1 but it was poorly eluted from it with an overall recovery of 2 6 the increase of buffer ph to 11 0 provided an improvement of elution efficiency and a final recovery of 28 8 further performance improvements could be obtained by changing the length of the elution incubation subsequent experiments for the concentration of hav and tgev from 50 l of spiked water samples were therefore all performed using an elution buffer ph 11 0 results showed that addition of tween 80 hampered the recovery of tgev possibly by damaging the lipid containing envelope of viruses recirculation of the eluent at ph 11 0 for 20 min was instead beneficial to the elution and provided recoveries of 18 0 and 23 9 for tgev and hav respectively similarly increasing peg concentration from 10 to 20 in the secondary concentration showed a significant improvement of the recovery 51 3 and 47 2 for tgev and hav respectively following optimization of the method the procedure provided a recovery efficiency of 5 1 for tgev and 4 5 for hav in spiked surface water overall the study by blanco et al 2019 clearly demonstrated that the concentration procedures commonly used for non enveloped viruses need adaptation to yield satisfactory performances on enveloped viruses like cov to summarize this scoping review has highlighted several aspects of coronavirus research that need to be explored in depth 1 the evidence of the presence of cov in waters is currently very scarce and there is no evidence that human cov are present in surface or groundwater sources or transmitted through contaminated drinking water 2 environmental factors such as temperature seem to affect the ability of cov to persist in water further studies are needed to investigate cov persistence in water in relation to climatic and seasonal conditions 3 although different studies showed different viral inactivation rates for cov in water based on the type of virus and the type of water generally there is evidence that cov is generally considered unstable in the environment and is more susceptible to oxidants such as chlorine than non enveloped viruses 4 based on the few available data methods commonly used to concentrate and recover non enveloped enteric viruses from wastewater and other water matrices may not be appropriate to recover cov therefore future research should focus on the development of robust methods for concentrating cov and other enveloped viruses from large volumes of waters and from different types of water 4 conclusion the evidence based knowledge here reported can be a key support for risk analysis in natural water resources and integrated water cycle according to the water and sanitation safety planning approaches as well as for the management and control of water related risks during the pandemic covid 19 caused by sars cov2 further researches are needed to study the potential presence and fate of coronavirus and other enveloped viruses in municipal wastewater and drinking water and to develop robust methods for water analysis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17873,coronaviruses cov are a large family of viruses causing a spectrum of disease ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases as middle east respiratory syndrome mers cov and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars cov the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 has become a public health emergency worldwide sars cov 2 the virus responsible for covid 19 is spread by human to human transmission via droplets or direct contact however since sars cov 2 as well as other coronaviruses has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients the possibility of fecal oral including waterborne transmission need to be investigated and clarified this scoping review was conducted to summarize research data on cov in water environments a literature survey was conducted using the electronic databases pubmed embase and web science core collection this comprehensive research yielded more than 3000 records but only 12 met the criteria and were included and discussed in this review in detail the review captured relevant studies investigating three main areas 1 cov persistence survival in waters 2 cov occurrence in water environments 3 methods for recovery of cov from waters the data available suggest that i cov seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants like chlorine ii cov appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission iii temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23 c 25 c than at 4 c iv there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking water v further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric non enveloped viruses from water environments the evidence based knowledge reported in this paper is useful to support risk analysis processes within the drinking and wastewater chain i e water and sanitation safety planning to protect human health from exposure to coronavirus through water keywords coronavirus sars cov 2 water disinfection survival occurrence method 1 introduction faecal contamination of water supplies has been historically recognised as a risk for human health water can provide a vehicle for pathogen spread creating the conditions for outbreaks or sporadic cases of infection human pathogenic viruses are often detected in water environments and are deemed to be responsible for a considerable proportion of waterborne diseases hamza and bibby 2019 haramoto et al 2018 la rosa et al 2012 moreira and bondelind rusinol and girones 2017 who 2017 viruses of concern for their potential waterborne transmission belong mainly to the group of enteric viruses a diverse group of non enveloped viruses which can multiply in the gastrointestinal tract of humans they can be mostly responsible of gastrointestinal illness but also of a wide spectrum of other diseases such as conjunctivitis respiratory symptoms viral hepatitis infections of the central nervous system the most important waterborne enteric viruses belong to the families caliciviridae norovirus picornaviridae enterovirus and hepatitis a virus and adenoviridae adenovirus who 2017 these viruses are often excreted at high titres in the feces and occasionally at lower concentrations in urines of infected humans rusinol and girones 2017 they have also been detected from virtually all types of water wastewater seawater fresh waters groundwater and drinking water and have been associated with drinking and recreational water outbreaks bonadonna and la rosa 2019 gall et al 2015 la rosa et al 2012 moreira and bondelind rusinol and girones 2017 conversely enveloped viruses are structurally dissimilar to the enteric non enveloped viruses and are believed to behave differently in water environments wigginton et al 2015 this group of viruses includes families such as orthomyxoviridae es influenza viruses paramyxoviridae measles virus mumps virus respiratory syncytial virus etc herpesviridae coronaviridae and several others viruses among the enveloped viruses coronaviruses cov order nidovirales family coronaviridae subfamily coronavirinae are single stranded positive sense rna viruses coronavirinae includes four genera alpha beta gamma and delta coronavirus of which the first two host viruses infecting humans human coronavirus hcov hcov 229e and hcov nl63 alphacoronaviruses and hcov hku1 hcov oc43 middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov betacoronaviruses cui et al 2019 moreover several coronavirus are reported to infect wildlife pets or livestock such as in the case of bat coronaviruses batcov porcine enteric diarrhoea cov pedv and transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv bovine coronavirus bcov and others reviewed in wong et al 2019 wang et al 2019 tekes and thiel 2016 amer 2018 hcov are respiratory pathogens and their primary transmission mode is person to person contact through respiratory droplets generated by breathing sneezing coughing etc and contact direct contact with an infected subject or indirect contact trough hand mediated transfer of the virus from contaminated fomites to the mouth nose or eyes waterborne transmission has never been demonstrated in humans however detection of hcov in the feces of infected patients has been reported esper et al 2010 jevšnik et al 2013 risku et al 2010 vabret et al 2006 suggesting the fecal oral route may contribute to hcov transmission in 2003 the sars cov was detected in the feces of infected patients isakbaeva et al 2004 and during an outbreak in a residential complex of amoy garden in hong kong transmission by aerosolized wastewater was suspected mckinney et al 2006 in late 2019 a new acute respiratory disease known as covid 19 sustained by a novel coronavirus sars cov 2 gorbalenya et al 2020 emerged in wuhan china and following global spread of the disease the outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 and the world health organization who on 11 february 2020 announced a name for the new coronavirus disease covid 19 on march 11 who upgraded the status of the covid 19 outbreak from epidemic to pandemic coronavirus virion is enveloped spherical and about 120 nm in diameter envelope proteins are involved in several aspects of the virus life cycle such as assembly envelope formation and pathogenesis inside the envelope is the helical capsid containing nucleoprotein and the rna genome fig 1 shows the virion structure of sars cov sars cov 2 the 25 32 kb genome of sars cov 2 is organized in two large open reading frames orf1a and orf1b located at the 5 end coding for replicase polyproteins followed in the terminal one third of the genome by a region encoding for the structural proteins spike envelope membrane and nucleocapsid protein fig 2 shows the linear ssrna genome of sars cov2 as for other respiratory hcov the main vehicle of transmission of sara cov 2 are droplets generated by breathing sneezing coughing etc and contact direct contact with an infected subject or indirect contact trough hand mediated transfer of the virus from contaminated fomites to the mouth nose or eyes in the rapidly evolving picture of the scientific knowledge on covid 19 and sars cov 2 some studies have reported the presence fragments of viral rna in feces or anal swab of infected patients holshue et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 transmission of covid 19 through the fecal oral route however has not been demonstrated nor occurrence of sars cov 2 in water environments has been proved to date information on the presence quantitative levels and survival in water environments of coronaviruses of interest for human health are indeed limited and few studies approached development and optimization of methods to concentrate cov or other enveloped viruses from wastewater biosolids surface waters or other water types see table 3 the present review summarizes the current state of knowledge on coronaviruses of interest for human health in water environments with an emphasis on their occurrence and persistence and on concentration methods for their detection in different water matrices the reported outcomes are aimed to improve knowledge on transmission pathways and possible infection hazards related to poor drinking water and sanitation management additionally research gaps on methodologies for detection with focus on concentration methods enveloped viruses are specifically examined to strengthen their monitoring in water media 2 methods an electronic search of available literature was run on 23 february 2020 search was conducted using the electronic databases pubmed embase and web science core collection with no restriction for publication date or language the search strategy included terms related to the virus group and the environmental matrices of interest see table 1 a total of 4382 articles were retrieved by the search and duplicates n 776 were automatically removed using the endnote reference manager software online using the rayyan review platform https rayyan qcri org welcome titles and abstracts of the retained 3606 articles were screened and assessed for eligibility by two independent reviewers glr and es and the disagreements were resolved by discussion between the reviewers and a third referee lb based on the objective of the study 3543 records were eliminated as not relevant full text screening was undertaken on the retained 63 articles and further 51 articles were excluded as either i unrelated to cov in water environments ii records duplicating results retrieved by earlier articles linked articles iii articles related only to inactivation of surrogate viruses other than cov iv reviews not including data relevant to the study v non relevant erratum for one of the 63 retained records full text was not available for screening but the article was assessed as relevant based on abstract content finally 12 articles were included in the study corresponding to original studies whose main findings are presented in tables 2 4 abd elmaksoud et al 2014 alexyuk et al 2017 bibby et al 2011 bibby and peccia 2013 blanco et al 2019 casanova et al 2009 collomb et al 1986 gundy et al 2019 wang et al 2005a wang et al 2005b wang et al 2005c ye et al 2016 3 results and discussion the twelve retrieved records were divided according to their content in studies related to the investigation of cov persistence and survival in water environments n 4 table 2 occurrence of cov pathogenic or potentially pathogenic to humans in water environments n 5 table 3 and analytical methods for concentration of cov from water n 5 table 4 the flow chart of the systematic literature review is illustrated in fig 3 3 1 persistence of coronavirus in water environments four papers dealing with the persistence or survival of cov in waters were retrieved table 2 the articles were related to seeding experiments in which sars cov human cov 229e or surrogate animal cov tgev fipv or murine hepatitis virus mhv were used to spike different water types wang et al 2005a casanova et al 2009 gundy et al 2009 ye et al 2016 wang and coworkers studied the persistence of sars cov in water hospital wastewater domestic sewage and dechlorinated tap water and in feces and urine wang et al 2005a in the study the effect of sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide in inactivating sars cov escherichia coli and the enterobacteria phage f2 spiked in wastewater was evaluated sars cov was detected in hospital wastewater domestic sewage and tap water for 2 days at 20 c and up to 14 days at 4 c thus demonstrating temperature strongly influences viral persistence indeed it has been universally demonstrated that higher temperatures are associated with rapid inactivation of enteric viruses and temperature is recognised as the most influential factor for viral survival in water due to increased denaturation of proteins and activity of extracellular enzymes pinon and vialette 2018 wang and coworkers wang et al 2005a highlighted that sars cov persists 3 days in stools and 17 days in urine stored at 20 c on the other hand at a lower temperature 4 c they persist for 17 days the same study showed that chlorine was more effective than chlorine dioxide in inactivating e coli f2 phage and sars cov and a free residual chlorine of 0 5 mg l from chlorine or 2 19 mg l from chlorine dioxide in wastewater ensured complete inactivation of sars cov in the experimental conditions of the study sars cov was inactivated completely in presence of 10 mg l chlorine and a minimum contact time of 10 min or in 1 min using 20 mg l chlorine under the same conditions e coli and f2 phage were not inactivated effectively this findings are of specific relevance since according to the 4th edition of the world health organization s guidelines for drinking water quality viruses are generally more resistant to free chlorine than bacteria specifically moderate resistance for viruses and low for the vast majority of bacteria who 2017 the viruses considered of concern for water in who guidelines however are principally enteric viruses familes adenoviridae astroviridae caliciviridae hepeviridae picornaviridae and reoviridae which are as previously reported non enveloped viruses it is well known that these viruses are more resistant to environmental conditions water treatments and disinfectants than enveloped viruses like coronavirus as lysis of the viral envelope leads to the loss of functional receptors required for infection of susceptible cells wigginton et al 2015 according to the results of wang 2005a sars cov resistance to chlorine is lower than for bacteria it follows that the current water disinfection practices drinking water wastewater water from swimming pool effective against non enveloped viruses and bacteria are expected to be effective also towards enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses the study of casanova et al 2009 evaluated the survival of two surrogate coronaviruses tgev transmissible gastroenteritis virus a porcine coronavirus and mhv murine hepatitis virus in reagent grade water lake water and settled human sewage two temperatures were evaluated over 6 weeks room temperature 23 25 c and 4 c in general in all the water tested the titer of infectious virus declined more rapidly at 25 c than at 4 c confirming that temperature is an important factor affecting viral survival in water at 25 c the time required for a 99 9 reduction t99 9 in reagent grade water was 33 days and 26 days for tgev and mhv respectively while in pasteurized settled sewage it was 14 days and 10 days respectively on the other hand no significant decrease of tgev and mhv was reported in reagent grade water at 4 c after 49 days and limited reduction was obtained at the same temperature in lake water after 14 days based on these results the authors suggest that contaminated water may be a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated however it is important to underline that the surrogate animal coronaviruses used in this study are responsible for gastrointestinal or hepatic diseases in animals and may therefore display a different resistance behaviour compared to respiratory human coronaviruses this could explain the greater resistance and longer survival displayed by cov in this work compared to the study of wang and colleagues 2005a moreover the use of different cell lines and growth media in these persistence studies might have contribute to measurement uncertainty gundy et al 2019 investigated the survival of a human coronavirus hcov 229e and of an animal coronavirus fipv feline infectious peritonitis virus in tap water filtered and non filtered and wastewater primary and activated sludge effluents comparing results with those of poliovirus 1 pv 1 sabin attenuated strain lsc 2ab in wastewater the tested cov died off quite rapidly with a t99 9 of 2 77 3 54 days at 23 c significantly the pv 1 lasted 2 to 3 times longer than cov did requiring 10 9 days for a comparable reduction in primary wastewater and 5 7 days in secondary effluents in tap water cov reduction was slower than in wastewaters at 23 c the t99 9 was 12 1 12 5 days for hcov 229e and fipv while at 4 c the same reduction was predicted by modelling to be achivable over 100 days these yields highlight once again that virus survival decreases with increasing temperature similarly to the results obtained on wastewater pv 1 survived six times longer than cov in both filtered and unfiltered tap water confirming the observation that non enveloped viruses display higher resistance in water enviroments compared to enveloped viruses another important finding of the study was that cov inactivation was faster in filtered tap water than unfiltered tap water suggesting that suspended solids in water can provide protection for viruses adsorbed to these particles finally a more recent study ye et al 2016 investigated the survival and partitioning of two enveloped viruses mhv and pseudomonas phage φ6 and of two non enveloped viruses bacteriophages ms2 and t3 in untreated municipal wastewater unpasteurized and pasteurized wastewater were spiked with the viral stocks and were then incubated at 25 c or 10 c to mimic typical summer and winter wastewater temperatures inactivation proceeded faster for the enveloped viruses in unpasteurized wastewaters at 25 c the time to reach a 90 reduction t90 was 13 h for mhv and 7 h phage φ6 compared to a predicted value of 121 h for the non enveloped phage ms2 at 10 c the inactivation kinetics of both mhv and φ6 were once again significantly slower than at environmental temperatures with a t90 of 28 36 h in pasteurized wastewater both mhv and phage φ6 lost infectivity at a significantly slower rate compared to unpasteurized wastewater t90 of 19 h for mhv and 53 h for phage φ6 at 25 c possibly due to the reduction of bacterial extracellular enzyme activity and the absence of protozoan and metazoan predation in pasteurized samples indeed it was demonstrated that the presence of an indigenous microbial population has a negative impact on virus survival pinon and vialette 2018 rzezutka and cook 2004 finally in the same study ye et al reported that up to 26 of the enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater that means that a reduction of enveloped viruses in wastewaters is provided by solid settling 3 2 occurrence of coronavirus in water environments two reports specifically addressing detection in water environments of cov of interest for human health and three metagenomic virome studies were retrieved through literature search table 3 sewage discharges from two hospitals in beijing china hosting sars patients during the 2003 outbreak were analyzed with the aim to investigate whether sewage may be a possible route of transmission for sars cov wang et al 2005b both cell culture and rt pcr were utilized to ascertain viability and detect the virus in sewage while viral genome was repeatedly detected in hospital sewage before disinfection 10 10 wastewater samples and in some cases after disinfection 3 10 samples infectious sars cov was never detected in the tested samples possible explanation of authors includes viral inactivation by disinfectants high concentration of disinfectants were used after a patient had bowel movements low viral concentration or loss of infectivity by unknown factors during the concentration process in the second study specifically addressing cov detection in water blanco et al 2019 investigated the occurrence of these viruses in surface waters of wadi hanifa riyadh using a broad range rt pcr for the detection of alpha and betacoronavirus of the 21 tested samples only one sample was positive for cov upon sequence analysis the positive sample was found to be closely related to a novel rodent shrew specific clade within lineage a of alphacoronavirus reported in asia and europe three metagenomic studies have detected cov in water matrices two focused on class b biosolids from wastewater treatment facility bibby et al 2011 bibby peccia 2013 and one on different type of water river lake reservoir alexyuk et al 2017 the study of bibby and coworkers identified a large variety of both enveloped and non enveloped viruses in biosolids including coronavirus herpesvirus torque teno virus and parechovirus interestingly all these groups of viruses were highly represented in compared to adenovirus which have been for long time considered the most abundant viral genus in biosolids bibby et al 2011 in detail 10 cov sequences were identified nine of which related to hcov 229e and one to hcov hku1 two years later another paper from the same authors described the diversity of viruses in sewage sludge samples influents and effluents with comparable results emerging viruses such as coronavirus klassevirus and cosavirus were detected in abundance in the sample bibby peccia 2013 coronaviruses were detected in 83 of samples and coronavirus hku1 was the second most prevalent rna virus interestingly coronavirus showed a higher relative abundance in influent samples compared to effluent ones finally alexyuk et al 2017 studied the viromes sampled in surface water river lake and water reservoir while the majority of the sequences were related to autochthonous viruses typical for aquatic ecosystems allochthonous viruses such families as coronaviridae reoviridae and herpesviridae were also detected suggesting anthropogenic pollution of the three selected water environments in detail coronaviridae were detected in all of the three environments ranging from 0 002 to 0 009 of the total sequences depending on sample to complete the picture on the occurrence of coronavirus in water environments after the initial submission of this scoping review while the paper was under review novel papers some of which published as preprint have demonstrated the occurrence of sars cov 2 in municipal wastewaters worldwide and specifically in the netherlands medema et al 2020 in massachusetts wu et al 2020 in australia ahmed et al 2020 france wurtzer et al 2020 and italy la rosa et al 2020 submitted 3 3 methods for concentration of enveloped viruses from water matrices five studies table 4 investigated concentration methods for cov in waters and the associated recovery efficiency the first study investigating cov recovery from waters was published more than 30 years ago collomb et al 1986 using for the spiking experiments a bovine enteric coronavirus and assessing a concentration procedure based on viral adsorption on glass powder at acid ph followed by alkaline ph elution since cov is sensitive to acid ph 3 and alkaline ph ph 10 adsorption was optimal at ph 3 3 and elution at ph 9 under such conditions the overall efficiency of the concentration method appeared to be between 24 and 28 unfortunately since it was not possible to retrieve the full text of this publication no further information beside those included in the abstract could be reported following the sars outbreak of 2003 wang et al 2005c performed a study to evaluate the recovery from spiked sewage of sars cov and of a surrogate virus bacteriophage f2 the concentration procedure foresaw the use of positively charged electropositive filter media particle silica gel plus al oh 3 packed in a glass column according to a protocol previously described by li et al 1998 for enteric viruses hospital sewage and domestic sewage 100 ml were spiked with sars cov and phage f2 passed through the glass column eluted from the filter media with 3 nutrient broth ph 7 2 and then polyethylene glycol peg precipitated the procedure gave recoveries of sars cov ranging from 0 sewage from a housing estate to 21 4 sewage from the hospital with an average of 1 02 the recovery of phage f2 under the same conditions were significantly higher from 33 6 to more than 100 this method therefore seemed more suitable for the concentration of enveloped viruses in agreement with the initial study proposing its use that showed recoveries of enterovirus and hepatitis a virus from tap water ranging from 88 7 to 96 0 li et al 1998 ye et al 2016 evaluated three methods for separating and concentrating viruses from the liquid fraction of municipal wastewater i peg precipitation ii ultracentrifugation iii ultrafiltration with centrifugal devices ye et al 2016 wastewater 250 ml for peg precipitation and ultrafiltration and 60 ml for ultracentrifugation was spiked with the rodent coronavirus murine hepatitis virus mhv and with the non enveloped phage ms2 low mean recoveries 5 were achieved for both mhv and ms2 with the ultracentrifugation method this result was suggested to be related to virus inactivation by the high g force of the ultracentrifugation recovery of mhv was low 5 also with the peg precipitation method whose performance for ms2 concentration was instead significantly higher 43 1 finally the optimized ultrafiltration protocol adopted in the study provided the highest recoveries for both viruses 25 1 for mhv and 55 6 for phage ms2 results of ye and colleagues suggested that the peg precipitation method which is effective at recovering non enveloped viruses from water samples may be not optimal for recovering infective enveloped viruses while ultrafiltration could be successfully applied for recovering cov however in this study only small volumes of wastewater were tested using centrifugal ultrafilters since viruses in water matrices may occur in very low numbers there is a need for analytical methods suitable to process large volumes of water it was therefore concluded by the authors that further progress could be made through the optimization of hollow fiber ultrafilters and tangential flow ultrafiltration to allow concentration of cov in waters from larger volumes of water abd elmaksoud and coworkers 2014 measured the effectiveness of glass wool filtration to simultaneously concentrate a variety of waterborne viral and bacterial pathogens typically found in runoff from agricultural fields using dairy manure as fertilizer viruses of bovine origin were used to spike 20 l of dechlorinated tap water including bovine coronavirus bocov bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2 bvdv1 and bvdv2 bovine rotavirus group a borv and poliovirus 3 sabin moreover e coli o157 nm and campylobacter jejuni were selected as bacterial pathogen three water turbidity levels were evaluated prepared by mixing dried agricultural soil into the 20 l of water after glass wool filtration elution was performed with 3 beef extract glycine buffer ph 9 5 followed by flocculation with peg 8000 recovered organisms were enumerated by qpcr results showed that glass wool filtration is a cost effective method for the concentration of several waterborne pathogens simultaneously in details the average recoveries across the different turbidity levels tested were 18 1 for bocov 22 1 for borv 15 6 and 19 7 for bvdv1 and bvdv2 respectively higher recovery efficiencies were obtained for the non enveloped virus poliovirus 3 57 9 and for the bacterial microorganisms e coli o157 nm 54 8 and c jejuni 32 7 however the authors advised to use caution in the interpretation of these comparative results since the quantity of pathogens used for spiking varied for the different microorganisms precluding a clear differentiation of the effects on recovery efficiency of seeding quantities and pathogen type blanco et al 2019 used adsorption to glass wool followed by elution with alkaline buffer and subsequent secondary concentration through peg 6000 precipitation the viruses used for the experimental procedures were hepatitis a virus hav non enveloped and the porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev large volumes of water 5 l and 50 l were used for method optimization and performance characterization several steps of the elution procedure were modified compared to other published glass wool protocols to improve the recovery of tgev and virus recoveries were ascertained by real time qpcr recovery of the initial experiments 5 l of water adsorption to the positively charged glass wool matrix elution with glycine beef extract buffer at ph 9 5 with 10 min of contact showed that tgev efficiently adsorbed onto the glass wool attachment of 57 1 but it was poorly eluted from it with an overall recovery of 2 6 the increase of buffer ph to 11 0 provided an improvement of elution efficiency and a final recovery of 28 8 further performance improvements could be obtained by changing the length of the elution incubation subsequent experiments for the concentration of hav and tgev from 50 l of spiked water samples were therefore all performed using an elution buffer ph 11 0 results showed that addition of tween 80 hampered the recovery of tgev possibly by damaging the lipid containing envelope of viruses recirculation of the eluent at ph 11 0 for 20 min was instead beneficial to the elution and provided recoveries of 18 0 and 23 9 for tgev and hav respectively similarly increasing peg concentration from 10 to 20 in the secondary concentration showed a significant improvement of the recovery 51 3 and 47 2 for tgev and hav respectively following optimization of the method the procedure provided a recovery efficiency of 5 1 for tgev and 4 5 for hav in spiked surface water overall the study by blanco et al 2019 clearly demonstrated that the concentration procedures commonly used for non enveloped viruses need adaptation to yield satisfactory performances on enveloped viruses like cov to summarize this scoping review has highlighted several aspects of coronavirus research that need to be explored in depth 1 the evidence of the presence of cov in waters is currently very scarce and there is no evidence that human cov are present in surface or groundwater sources or transmitted through contaminated drinking water 2 environmental factors such as temperature seem to affect the ability of cov to persist in water further studies are needed to investigate cov persistence in water in relation to climatic and seasonal conditions 3 although different studies showed different viral inactivation rates for cov in water based on the type of virus and the type of water generally there is evidence that cov is generally considered unstable in the environment and is more susceptible to oxidants such as chlorine than non enveloped viruses 4 based on the few available data methods commonly used to concentrate and recover non enveloped enteric viruses from wastewater and other water matrices may not be appropriate to recover cov therefore future research should focus on the development of robust methods for concentrating cov and other enveloped viruses from large volumes of waters and from different types of water 4 conclusion the evidence based knowledge here reported can be a key support for risk analysis in natural water resources and integrated water cycle according to the water and sanitation safety planning approaches as well as

leading to spillover chan et al 2015 in fact before the outbreak of the current virus a number of authors addressing the environmental circulation of viruses had already highlighted the potential new

contain the epidemic virus thus requiring efficient disinfection before discharge into natural waters owing to concerns about sars cov 2 water pollution north korea has recently started to monitor surface waters used as sources of drinking water as recently announced in newspapers by the korean government funded news agency byung joon 2020 on yonhap news agency even though other countries are reassuring the public about the safety of drinking water la rosa et al 2020 the problem of water pollution was also addressed in a technical brief of the who on water sanitation hygiene and waste management for covid 19 march 3 2020 this focused on enteric viruses including coronaviruses and indicates that measures used for the non enveloped enteric virus abatement should be even more efficient for coronavirus who 2020c nevertheless the brief confirms the lack of knowledge regarding coronavirus in water knowledge of the presence of the coronavirus and more specifically of sars cov 2 in wastewater along with its survival and removal by different treatment approaches could be very useful for risk assessment and management 2 literature search strategy in order to define the state of the art regarding coronavirus generally and for epidemic strains in the water environment a literature search was conducted on april 20 2020 using three bibliographic databases pubmed scopus and web of science without time limitations to include even the oldest papers the search was performed with the following keywords coronavirus sars cov 2 sars mers covid 19 associated with water wastewater sewage slurry sludge and biosolids to give a comprehensive view of the topic the literature search was extended to preprints using the medrxiv server https www medrxiv org with the same criteria cited above papers were screened in relation to the title and abstract in order to eliminate duplicates and to check whether they complied with the aim of the survey the selected papers were read entirely to collect data on coronavirus type and strain type of water sample type of study experimental or field detection methods monitoring data survival data effect of disinfection and treatments the time span covered by the papers identified by the search extended from 1978 to 2020 however the number of specific papers corresponding to the keywords used was very small only 22 of which 4 papers were preprints from medrxiv these papers are reported and summarized in table 1 with the exception of one study published in 1978 the other papers were published after the sars late 2002 early 2003 and mers late 2012 emergencies fig 1 reports the timeline of the reviewed studies divided on the basis of topic nine papers consisted of in vitro studies eleven papers were monitoring studies and two papers included both research aspects the papers were not comparable because they had different purposes and used different methodologies 3 in vitro experiments on spiked samples in total there were 11 in vitro studies seven of which used surrogates one human coronavirus and three used both seven papers investigated animal coronaviruses in particular bovine cov bcov the mouse hepatitis virus mhv responsible for respiratory and enteric symptoms in laboratory mice the transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev responsible for diarrheal disease in swine and the feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv abd elmaksoud et al 2014 christensen and myrmel 2018 casanova et al 2009 fan et al 2010 ye et al 2016 blanco et al 2019 gundy et al 2009 in addition bacteriophages f2 φ6 were employed as model viruses because they share similar features with coronavirus such as an envelope and their small size up to 120 nm they also have the advantages of being harmless to humans and can be easily detected with simple cultural methods wang et al 2005b c casanova and weaver 2015 ye et al 2016 in addition phage φ6 is considered as a conservative surrogate of coronavirus because it has a double stranded rna genome that confers greater stability than the single stranded rna genomes of coronavirus casanova and weaver 2015 only four studies experimented with the human coronavirus in particular sars cov and human cov 229e duan et al 2003 wang et al 2005b c gundy et al 2009 the aims of in vitro experiments can be divided into two groups to test the recovery efficiency of different methodologies for sample concentration and viral detection 5 papers and to assess the virus survival in different types of water and or at different temperatures 6 papers or to evaluate the virus removal efficiency of different water treatments 2 papers the studies carried out by wang et al 2005b and ye et al 2016 had more than one aim see table 1 3 1 recovery efficiency of analytical methods current methods are set up for non enveloped viruses i e adenovirus norovirus hepatitis a virus which are normally linked to waterborne transmission bosch et al 2008 la rosa et al 2012 coronavirus as well as other enveloped viruses exhibit structural and biochemical properties which suggest that the same methods would not have the same recovery efficiency different methods have therefore been tested on different water samples spiked with different viruses two papers focused on glass wool filtration methods widely used for non enveloped viruses which consist in an initial phase of adsorption and elution to positively charged glass wool followed by a second phase of precipitation with polyethylene glycol 6000 peg abd elmaksoud et al 2014 blanco et al 2019 abd elmaksoud et al 2014 analysed 20 l of dechlorinated tap water with different turbidities spiked with bcov detected with pcr they found highly variable virus recovery rates 18 1 20 1 results from the samples with low turbidity reported the highest recovery efficiency 25 8 21 3 blanco et al 2019 optimized the glass wool filtration method using 50 l of surface waters spiked with tgev detected with cell cultures by raising the ph of the buffer eluent to 11 0 at 9 5 for non enveloped viruses by increasing the contact time from 10 to 20 min and using a 20 concentration of peg instead of 10 the virus recovery thus improved from 0 40 to 5 1 1 4 although both studies used the same method the results are not directly comparable because the studies differed in terms of coronavirus strain type and volume of water samples quantity of virus seeded and detection method wang et al 2005c evaluated a virus concentration method based on the adsorption on electropositive filter media particle columns elution with broth at ph 7 2 and precipitation by 10 peg they analysed 100 ml of sewage spiked with sars cov and phage f2 detected with cultural methods and obtained a much higher recovery efficiency for phage f2 on average 127 1 ranging from 33 6 to 260 0 than for sars cov 1 02 ranging from 0 to 21 4 ye et al 2016 applied a two step method to wastewater samples based on a preliminary centrifugation aimed at removing solid particles and then ultrafiltration on the liquid fraction both solid and liquid parts were analysed with cultural methods small wastewater samples 30 ml were spiked with mhv and phage φ6 both enveloped and with phages ms2 and t3 non enveloped and the method was optimized for both fractions to increase the recovery rates of the enveloped viruses they achieved mean recovery rates of 25 1 for mhv 18 2 for ϕ6 55 6 for ms2 and 85 5 for t3 thus confirming the lower efficiency of the concentration methods for enveloped viruses in addition although up to 26 of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction compared to 6 of the two non enveloped ones only 3 7 of mhv and 2 of ms2 were recovered from it a completely different approach was followed by fan et al 2010 who tested the efficiency of a methodology for virus detection based on surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers coupled with statistical analysis methods to interpret the sers spectral pattern they used deionized water spiked with mhv with a very high final concentration 106 107 pfu ml the results demonstrated that this methodology was able to differentiate viruses at the strain level however its real usefulness for rapid detection and identification of viruses in environmental water samples was questionable owing to the low sensitivity the small numbers of studies on the detection methods for coronavirus and surrogates in water is likely motivated by the assumption that they are not considered to be waterborne although the results of these studies are not directly comparable they indicate that methods normally used for non enveloped viruses need to be improved for enveloped viruses and that in any case they have a lower efficiency 3 2 survival in different types of water and removal efficiency of treatments in the survival studies a variable persistence of viruses was identified depending on the type of virus type of water sample and temperature duan et al 2003 found a reduction in sars cov infectivity up to an undetectable level after 3 4 days at room temperature in 300 μl of sterilized water initially containing a viral titer of 106 tcid50 the persistence of infective sars cov was reduced in 2 day at 20 c in all the water types tested by wang et al 2005b namely hospital wastewater domestic sewage and tap water but at 4 c it increased to 14 days which was the duration of the entire study period over a 21 day study period gundy et al 2009 compared the survival of hcov 229e and fivp with that of poliovirus 1 in filtered unfiltered tap water and wastewater in tap water coronavirus showed a 3 log10 decrease in 10 days at 23 c and over a longer period estimated 100 days at 4 c in addition fivp inactivation at 4 c was faster compared to hcov 229e in wastewater only at 23 c both coronaviruses survived for a shorter period 2 4 days poliovirus survived longer than coronaviruses in all tested water samples at 23 c similar to 4 c in tap water other studies showed a prolonged survival of animal coronavirus and surrogates in different water matrices casanova et al 2009 reported a 2 log10 decline in tgev and mhv infectivity after more than 15 days in reagent grade water at 25 c the survival was strongly prolonged at 4 c over 49 days no reduction was observed both in reagent grade and lake water for mhv whilst a 1 log10 reduction after 14 days was observed in lake water for tgev this study also demonstrated a faster decline in infectivity in wastewater in particular a 2 log10 reduction was observed after nine and seven days for tgev and mhv respectively in pasteurized sewage at 23 25 c room temperature and 2 log10 and 1 log10 reductions after 35 days at 4 c in a later work casanova and weaver 2015 found a 2 log10 reduction of phage φ6 after five days in pasteurized raw sewage at 22 c but with nonlinear inactivation kinetics studying mhv and phage φ6 in raw sewage ye et al 2016 compared the virus survival in pasteurized and unpasteurized wastewater while in pasteurized sewage they found a 2 log10 reduction at 25 c after 30 40 h for mhv and 50 h for phage φ6 in the unpasteurized samples the inactivation time was reduced to 13 and 7 h respectively indicating the possible role of other microorganisms bacteria and protozoa in the viral inactivation the reduction in the enveloped viruses was significantly slower in wastewater at 10 c compared to 25 c in the same study phages ms2 and t3 non enveloped survived longer in all conditions and matrices although these studies are fragmentary and not directly comparable they indicate that human coronavirus and surrogates are less resistant than non enveloped viruses in water environments that their survival is generally reduced in waters with organic and microbial pollution and that viral inactivation increases with increasing temperatures several studies have considered the efficacy of disinfection treatments against sars cov and surrogates on surfaces kampf et al 2020 however water disinfection was only addressed by wang et al 2005b who analysed the resistance to different chlorine solutions of sars cov and phage f2 seeded into 100 ml domestic sewage during a 30 min disinfection assay sars cov was completely inactivated with 10 mg l chlorine or 20 mg l chlorine dioxide while phage f2 needed a higher chlorine concentration 40 mg l and was not completely inactivated even by 40 mg l chlorine dioxide christensen and myrmel 2018 tested the virus removal efficiency at the bench scale of a coagulation filtration system previously optimized using three different coagulants zirconium chitosan and polyaluminium chloride in reducing bcov and other viruses hepatis a virus bovine norovirus and ms2 diluted and undiluted water samples 400 ml from water treatment plants were spiked with viral mixtures after the addition of coagulants centrifugation and filtration steps the supernatant and filtrate were analysed for quantification a combination of flocculation and filtration led to a decline in viral presence from 10 to 70 depending on the type of virus coagulant and presence of natural organic matter bcov was reduced more mean 4 log10 in undiluted water by all the three coagulants than in diluted water in this last example chitosan performed the best 4 environmental monitoring studies as of 2019 a total of seven studies had monitored the presence of coronavirus sars and animal in water sewage slurry or biosolids generally as part of a wider project overall their findings are heterogeneous in terms of the goals of the study matrices and detection methods derbyshire and brown 1978 analysed different environmental matrices impacted by breeding activities for a total of 158 samples collected from surface runoff surface waters and groundwaters 20 l each as well as slurry from pig and cattle sources 2 l each the study used different virus concentration methods based on the type of environmental matrices and seeded the eluates on primary cell cultures from slurry samples 56 the study found 25 porcine enteroviruses three adenovirus and one coronavirus the analysis of water samples 102 revealed the presence of only three porcine enteroviruses and one bovine enterovirus however no coronavirus was found wang et al 2005c analysed a total of 20 sewage samples before 2 5 l and after 25 l disinfection by chlorine from hospitals receiving sars patients samples were concentrated by electropositive filter media particle the virus recovery was also assessed in the same study see section 3 2 and the eluates were then analysed for sars cov using both cell culture and rt pcr all samples were negative for infectious sars cov however the genome was detected in all samples before disinfection 100 and in three samples after disinfection 15 schwarte et al 2011 studied the impact of grazing animals on the microbial and chemical physical water quality of pasture streams using different simulated scenarios in a rural area bcov together with bovine enterovirus and bovine rotavirus were measured from simulated runoff 360 samples and cow feces 90 samples as viruses are commonly shed by grazing animals the pathogen load was analysed using multiplex rt qpcr however the procedure for sample concentration was not described bovine enterovirus was detected both in cow feces 24 3 and in the runoff samples ranging from 8 3 to 16 7 while bovine coronavirus was only present in one feces sample 1 1 bovine rotavirus was not detected in any of the samples bibby et al 2011 2013 characterized viral pathogens in sewage sludge through metagenomic analysis the entire genome extracted was sequenced by shotgun pyrosequencing in their two studies they followed different procedures for virus recovery from sludge but in both cases they found that coronaviruses were the most abundant human viruses occurring in over 80 of samples bibby and peccia 2013 the human coronavirus strains 229e and hku1 were identified both studies produced a list of the most abundant viruses which could be extremely useful in quantitative pathogen monitoring corsi et al 2014 collected samples from three streams in the usa running through an area with rural and urban land use they used an automated large volume sample collection and virus concentration system based on pre filtration and glass wool filter the virus eluates were then analysed using rt qpcr for bcov and various other viruses around 20 l composite samples were obtained mixing 5 l subsamples collected over time by the system in two different conditions low flow period and during runoff events for a total of 63 samples the eluates were analysed using rt qpcr to measure both human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus genogroups i and ii hepatitis a virus and rotavirus and bovine adenovirus enterovirus rotavirus group a polyomavirus coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus types 1 and 2 enteric viruses during the study period all the human viruses were detected in the samples as well as numerous animal and bovine viruses except bcov in the most recent study blanco et al 2019 concentrated 10 l samples of surface waters by an optimized glass wool filtration method see section 3 1 and used a semi nested rt pcr for wild type alpha beta cov followed by sequencing they analysed a total of 21 samples and found only one positive result for alphacoronavirus which was related to a novel rodent shrew specific clade by the sequence analysis in the studies conducted until 2019 field investigations also confirmed the scarcity of data on coronavirus in water coronaviruses were rarely searched for and more rarely found although the lack of positive results could derive from the low recovery efficiency of the methods used as shown above however in the early months of 2020 six field studies focused on a sars cov 2 search in wastewater samples owing to the increasing focus on the environmental circulation of the new coronavirus in australia ahmed et al 2020 collected 100 200 ml of sewage nine samples concentrated them with two different methods filtration by electronegative membranes and ultrafiltration and analysed the concentrates with rt qpcr using with two different primer probe sets for nucleocapsid protein gene the authors obtained one positivity for each concentration method not the same sample but with only one set of primers and at very low titers 1 2 and 1 9 genomic copies 100 ml in china wang et al 2020 sampled the wastewater of a hospital at various stages of a multi stage disinfection with sodium hypochlorite five samples three before disinfection and one for each of the disinfection stages were analysed with rt qpcr and a culture assay the samples from the inlet and after the first disinfection stage were positive the sample after disinfection was negative all were non infective the four other monitoring studies on this topic were retrieved from medrxiv as preliminary reports which had not yet been peer reviewed in the netherlands medema et al 2020 monitored sewage samples and obtained positive signals only in 14 77 8 of the 18 samples collected after the occurrence of the first cases of covid 19 in the usa massachusetts wu et al 2020 collected 10 samples from wwtps after the first known cases of covid 19 and detected sars cov 2 in all of them with approximately 100 genomic copies ml the same result was obtained after the storage of samples at 4 c for 24 h and for a week again in the usa montana nemudryi et al 2020 collected seven samples of raw sewage which tested positive for sars cov 2 with a viral load from 100 to 2000 genomic copies l in france wurtzer et al 2020 collected both raw and treated wastewater from urban wwtp 31 samples obtaining 100 and 75 positivity respectively with a 2 log10 reduction after treatment overall these recent studies confirm the lack of standardized concentration methods for enveloped viruses see table 1 and the need to use the same method in order to be able to compare results from different studies 5 conclusions concerns about possible secondary transmission of the novel sars cov 2 via water are growing with the evidence of its fecal elimination moreover the results of in vitro experiments of prolonged virus survival with declining temperatures suggest that coronavirus excreted in feces could reach wastewater treatment plants in an infective state especially in cool climates however current knowledge is very scarce and fragmentary prior to covid 19 interest in this topic was very low owing to the common belief that enveloped viruses cannot survive for extended periods in water however the assumption that sars cov 2 is not involved in environmental circulation cannot be accepted without better knowledge as highlighted by the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater by six different global research groups the ongoing sars cov 2 emergency and its rapid spread demands new attention on its detection in water the scarcity of information on the presence and persistence of coronavirus in the environment merits urgent research in the meantime we should respond to the ongoing pandemic by taking precautions and assume that there is a potential for secondary transmission in particular we believe that research should address the following set up efficient methods to concentrate and detect enveloped viruses and coronavirus in particular from water matrices evaluate the survival of these viruses in natural conditions at different temperatures and in different types of water assess the efficiency of water treatments and disinfection to avoid contamination from urban and hospital wastewater evaluate the implications for water reuse for agriculture including the possibility of food raw vegetables contamination establish a surveillance system through sewage monitoring of the potential virus circulation declaration

centrifugation aimed at removing solid particles and then ultrafiltration on the liquid fraction both solid and liquid parts were analysed with cultural methods small wastewater samples 30 ml were spiked with mhv and phage φ6 both enveloped and with phages ms2 and t3 non enveloped and the method was optimized for both fractions to increase the recovery rates of the enveloped viruses they achieved mean recovery rates of 25 1 for mhv 18 2 for ϕ6 55 6 for ms2 and 85 5 for t3 thus confirming the lower efficiency of the concentration methods for enveloped viruses in addition although up to 26 of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction compared to 6 of the two non enveloped ones only 3 7 of mhv and 2 of ms2 were recovered from it a completely different approach was followed by fan et al 2010 who tested the efficiency of a methodology for virus detection based on surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers coupled with statistical analysis methods to interpret the sers spectral pattern they used deionized water spiked with mhv with a very high final concentration 106 107 pfu ml the results demonstrated that this methodology was able to differentiate viruses at the strain level however its real usefulness for rapid detection and identification of viruses in environmental water samples was questionable owing to the low sensitivity the small numbers of studies on the detection methods for coronavirus and surrogates in water is likely motivated by the assumption that they are not considered to be waterborne although the results of these studies are not directly comparable they indicate that methods normally used for non enveloped viruses need to be improved for enveloped viruses and that in any case they have a lower efficiency 3 2 survival in different types of water and removal efficiency of treatments in the survival studies a variable persistence of viruses was identified depending on the type of virus type of water sample and temperature duan et al 2003 found a reduction in sars cov infectivity up to an undetectable level after 3 4 days at room temperature in 300 μl of sterilized water initially containing a viral titer of 106 tcid50 the persistence of infective sars cov was reduced in 2 day at 20 c in all the water types tested by wang et al 2005b namely hospital wastewater domestic sewage and tap water but at 4 c it increased to 14 days which was the duration of the entire study period over a 21 day study period gundy et al 2009 compared the survival of hcov 229e and fivp with that of poliovirus 1 in filtered unfiltered tap water and wastewater in tap water coronavirus showed a 3 log10 decrease in 10 days at 23 c and over a longer period estimated 100 days at 4 c in addition fivp inactivation at 4 c was faster compared to hcov 229e in wastewater only at 23 c both coronaviruses survived for a shorter period 2 4 days poliovirus survived longer than coronaviruses in all tested water samples at 23 c similar to 4 c in tap water other studies showed a prolonged survival of animal coronavirus and surrogates in different water matrices casanova et al 2009 reported a 2 log10 decline in tgev and mhv infectivity after more than 15 days in reagent grade water at 25 c the survival was strongly prolonged at 4 c over 49 days no reduction was observed both in reagent grade and lake water for mhv whilst a 1 log10 reduction after 14 days was observed in lake water for tgev this study also demonstrated a faster decline in infectivity in wastewater in particular a 2 log10 reduction was observed after nine and seven days for tgev and mhv respectively in pasteurized sewage at 23 25 c room temperature and 2 log10 and 1 log10 reductions after 35 days at 4 c in a later work casanova and weaver 2015 found a 2 log10 reduction of phage φ6 after five days in pasteurized raw sewage at 22 c but with nonlinear inactivation kinetics studying mhv and phage φ6 in raw sewage ye et al 2016 compared the virus survival in pasteurized and unpasteurized wastewater while in pasteurized sewage they found a 2 log10 reduction at 25 c after 30 40 h for mhv and 50 h for phage φ6 in the unpasteurized samples the inactivation time was reduced to 13 and 7 h respectively indicating the possible role of other microorganisms bacteria and protozoa in the viral inactivation the reduction in the enveloped viruses was significantly slower in wastewater at 10 c compared to 25 c in the same study phages ms2 and t3 non enveloped survived longer in all conditions and matrices although these studies are fragmentary and not directly comparable they indicate that human coronavirus and surrogates are less resistant than non enveloped viruses in water environments that their survival is generally reduced in waters with organic and microbial pollution and that viral inactivation increases with increasing temperatures several studies have considered the efficacy of disinfection treatments against sars cov and surrogates on surfaces kampf et al 2020 however water disinfection was only addressed by wang et al 2005b who analysed the resistance to different chlorine solutions of sars cov and phage f2 seeded into 100 ml domestic sewage during a 30 min disinfection assay sars cov was completely inactivated with 10 mg l chlorine or 20 mg l chlorine dioxide while phage f2 needed a higher chlorine concentration 40 mg l and was not completely inactivated even by 40 mg l chlorine dioxide christensen and myrmel 2018 tested the virus removal efficiency at the bench scale of a coagulation filtration system previously optimized using three different coagulants zirconium chitosan and polyaluminium chloride in reducing bcov and other viruses hepatis a virus bovine norovirus and ms2 diluted and undiluted water samples 400 ml from water treatment plants were spiked with viral mixtures after the addition of coagulants centrifugation and filtration steps the supernatant and filtrate were analysed for quantification a combination of flocculation and filtration led to a decline in viral presence from 10 to 70 depending on the type of virus coagulant and presence of natural organic matter bcov was reduced more mean 4 log10 in undiluted water by all the three coagulants than in diluted water in this last example chitosan performed the best 4 environmental monitoring studies as of 2019 a total of seven studies had monitored the presence of coronavirus sars and animal in water sewage slurry or biosolids generally as part of a wider project overall their findings are heterogeneous in terms of the goals of the study matrices and detection methods derbyshire and brown 1978 analysed different environmental matrices impacted by breeding activities for a total of 158 samples collected from surface runoff surface waters and groundwaters 20 l each as well as slurry from pig and cattle sources 2 l each the study used different virus concentration methods based on the type of environmental matrices and seeded the eluates on primary cell cultures from slurry samples 56 the study found 25 porcine enteroviruses three adenovirus and one coronavirus the analysis of water samples 102 revealed the presence of only three porcine enteroviruses and one bovine enterovirus however no coronavirus was found wang et al 2005c analysed a total of 20 sewage samples before 2 5 l and after 25 l disinfection by chlorine from hospitals receiving sars patients samples were concentrated by electropositive filter media particle the virus recovery was also assessed in the same study see section 3 2 and the eluates were then analysed for sars cov using both cell culture and rt pcr all samples were negative for infectious sars cov however the genome was detected in all samples before disinfection 100 and in three samples after disinfection 15 schwarte et al 2011 studied the impact of grazing animals on the microbial and chemical physical water quality of pasture streams using different simulated scenarios in a rural area bcov together with bovine enterovirus and bovine rotavirus were measured from simulated runoff 360 samples and cow feces 90 samples as viruses are commonly shed by grazing animals the pathogen load was analysed using multiplex rt qpcr however the procedure for sample concentration was not described bovine enterovirus was detected both in cow feces 24 3 and in the runoff samples ranging from 8 3 to 16 7 while bovine coronavirus was only present in one feces sample 1 1 bovine rotavirus was not detected in any of the samples bibby et al 2011 2013 characterized viral pathogens in sewage sludge through metagenomic analysis the entire genome extracted was sequenced by shotgun pyrosequencing in their two studies they followed different procedures for virus recovery from sludge but in both cases they found that coronaviruses were the most abundant human viruses occurring in over 80 of samples bibby and peccia 2013 the human coronavirus strains 229e and hku1 were identified both studies produced a list of the most abundant viruses which could be extremely useful in quantitative pathogen monitoring corsi et al 2014 collected samples from three streams in the usa running through an area with rural and urban land use they used an automated large volume sample collection and virus concentration system based on pre filtration and glass wool filter the virus eluates were then analysed using rt qpcr for bcov and various other viruses around 20 l composite samples were obtained mixing 5 l subsamples collected over time by the system in two different conditions low flow period and during runoff events for a total of 63 samples the eluates were analysed using rt qpcr to measure both human adenovirus enterovirus norovirus genogroups i and ii hepatitis a virus and rotavirus and bovine adenovirus enterovirus rotavirus group a polyomavirus coronavirus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus types 1 and 2 enteric viruses during the study period all the human viruses were detected in the samples as well as numerous animal and bovine viruses except bcov in the most recent study blanco et al 2019 concentrated 10 l samples of surface waters by an optimized glass wool filtration method see section 3 1 and used a semi nested rt pcr for wild type alpha beta cov followed by sequencing they analysed a total of 21 samples and found only one positive result for alphacoronavirus which was related to a novel rodent shrew specific clade by the sequence analysis in the studies conducted until 2019 field investigations also confirmed the scarcity of data on coronavirus in water coronaviruses were rarely searched for and more rarely found although the lack of positive results could derive from the low recovery efficiency of the methods used as shown above however in the early months of 2020 six field studies focused on a sars cov 2 search in wastewater samples owing to the increasing focus on the environmental circulation of the new coronavirus in australia ahmed et al 2020 collected 100 200 ml of sewage nine samples concentrated them with two different methods filtration by electronegative membranes and ultrafiltration and analysed the concentrates with rt qpcr using with two different primer probe sets for nucleocapsid protein gene the authors obtained one positivity for each concentration method not the same sample but with only one set of primers and at very low titers 1 2 and 1 9 genomic copies 100 ml in china wang et al 2020 sampled the wastewater of a hospital at various stages of a multi stage disinfection with sodium hypochlorite five samples three before disinfection and one for each of the disinfection stages were analysed with rt qpcr and a culture assay the samples from the inlet and after the first disinfection stage were positive the sample after disinfection was negative all were non infective the four other monitoring studies on this topic were retrieved from medrxiv as preliminary reports which had not yet been peer reviewed in the netherlands medema et al 2020 monitored sewage samples and obtained positive signals only in 14 77 8 of the 18 samples collected after the occurrence of the first cases of covid 19 in the usa massachusetts wu et al 2020 collected 10 samples from wwtps after the first known cases of covid 19 and detected sars cov 2 in all of them with approximately 100 genomic copies ml the same result was obtained after the storage of samples at 4 c for 24 h and for a week again in the usa montana nemudryi et al 2020 collected seven samples of raw sewage which tested positive for sars cov 2 with a viral load from 100 to 2000 genomic copies l in france wurtzer et al 2020 collected both raw and treated wastewater from urban wwtp 31 samples obtaining 100 and 75 positivity respectively with a 2 log10 reduction after treatment overall these recent studies confirm the lack of standardized concentration methods for enveloped viruses see table 1 and the need to use the same method in order to be able to compare results from different studies 5 conclusions concerns about possible secondary transmission of the novel sars cov 2 via water are growing with the evidence of its fecal elimination moreover the results of in vitro experiments of prolonged virus survival with declining temperatures suggest that coronavirus excreted in feces could reach wastewater treatment plants in an infective state especially in cool climates however current knowledge is very scarce and fragmentary prior to covid 19 interest in this topic was very low owing to the common belief that enveloped viruses cannot survive for extended periods in water however the assumption that sars cov 2 is not involved in environmental circulation cannot be accepted without better knowledge as highlighted by the detection of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater by six different global research groups the ongoing sars cov 2 emergency and its rapid spread demands new attention on its detection in water the scarcity of information on the presence and persistence of coronavirus in the environment merits urgent research in the meantime we should respond to the ongoing pandemic by taking precautions and assume that there is a potential for secondary transmission in particular we believe that research should address the following set up efficient methods to concentrate and detect enveloped viruses and coronavirus in particular from water matrices evaluate the survival of these viruses in natural conditions at different temperatures and in different types of water assess the efficiency of water treatments and disinfection to avoid contamination from urban and hospital wastewater evaluate the implications for water reuse for agriculture including the possibility of food raw vegetables contamination establish a surveillance system through sewage monitoring of the potential virus circulation declaration
