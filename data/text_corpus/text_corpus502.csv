2510,numerous studies have revealed dam and sluice ds induced modifications in the natural hydrologic regime and ecological flow hr ef by identifying the pre and post impact periods however few studies have separated the impacts of climate variability dss and land use change on the hr ef in rivers in addition the question of the integrated effect and contribution of multiple dss on hr ef as the number of dss increases and their position difference remains unanswered this study attempts to provide a framework for assessing the impact of integrated regulation with different numbers of multiple dss on the alterations in hr ef by separating disturbances from climate variability and land use change based on streamflow observations and hydrological modeling the shaying river basin srb one of the basins with the most severe ds regulations in china was selected as the study area for this case study the 33 flow regime indicators as well as the ecosurplus and ecodeficit indicators were applied to comprehensively reflect the impacts of multiple dss on hr ef the results indicated that dss contributed the most to the alterations in hr ef in the srb followed by climate variability whereas land use change contributed the least the integrated regulation of multiple dss has a significant effect on hr ef in rivers and this effect increases as the number of dss increases the low and high flows were more seriously affected by the dss than the middle flow resulting in an increase in the frequency of the low flow but an obvious decrease in the frequency of the high flow the seasonal variation in the ecodeficit showed that ecological flow during spring summer and winter was greater than that in autumn in the basin the proposed framework provides insights into the methodology for separating the impacts of climate variability dss and land use change on hr ef and is valuable in understanding the change in hr ef induced by different numbers of multiple dss at different locations

affecting the natural hydrologic regime and ecological flow hr ef in terms of magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of flow yang et al 2020a timpe and kaplan 2017 currently a large number of dss have been constructed worldwide and an increasing number of dss are continuously being constructed to meet the growing energy and water demands luo et al 2020 von schiller et al 2016 according to zhang et al 2017 the number of dams in the world is estimated to be greater than 16 million with a total storage volume of approximately 8000 km3 and millions of sluices total storage capacity 0 10 million m3 had been constructed globally the impacts of multiple dss on hr ef are more complicated than those of individual dss because of their irregular regulation as well as different numbers and spatial distributions shen et al 2022 lajoie et al 2007 a deeper understanding of the cumulative impact and contribution of multiple dss on hr ef as the number of dss increases can provide useful insights into integrated water resource management and ecological function protection in ds regulated basins barbarossa et al 2020 boulange et al 2021 note that hr ef in ds regulated basins is comprehensively affected by multiple factors such as climate variability dss and other types of human activities zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 hecht et al 2019 however to the best of our knowledge few studies have separated the impacts of climate variability dss and land use change on hr ef in rivers although this is critical for a better understanding of the impacts of dss on hr ef the selection of appropriate indicators is key to reflecting the alterations in hydrological and efs various indicators have been developed and introduced to describe the different aspects of hr wang et al 2021 the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha originally introduced by the nature conservancy and led by richter have been widely used to study alterations in hr affected by dss richter et al 1996 the iha use pre and post impact streamflow data to calculate 33 ecologically relevant indicators reflecting a wide range of hrs from magnitude duration timing and frequency to the rate of change richter et al 1996 lópez ballesteros et al 2020 szmańda et al 2021 furthermore ecosurplus and ecodeficit which are based on the flow duration curve are two commonly used comprehensive indicators for assessing changes in ef in hydrology research gao et al 2009 they represent the overall deficit or surplus of streamflow resulting from flow alteration and require at least 15 years of streamflow data both before and after the ds completion date he et al 2021 gao et al 2009 kennard et al 2010 fantin cruz et al 2015 based on these indices alterations in hr ef induced by multiple dss have been well documented worldwide song et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 jardim et al 2020 gao et al 2012 lin et al 2014 talukdar and pal 2017 song et al 2020 studied the impact of dams on hr changes in china using iha and zhou et al 2020 evaluated the cumulative impacts of cascade dams on the flow regime of the jinsha river by combining iha with the projection pursuit and real coded accelerated genetic algorithm jardim et al 2020 assessed the large scale hydrologic alteration in the south american pantanal due to upstream dam operation using iha furthermore some studies have analyzed changes in hr ef based on a combination of eco flow metrics ecosurplus and ecodeficit and iha gao et al 2012 lin et al 2014 talukdar and pal 2017 most recent studies have mainly focused on 1 identifying the pre and post impact periods using methods such as change point detection techniques to compare streamflow in periods before and after identified hydrological breakpoints cui et al 2020 pérez ciria et al 2019 showed that wavelet analysis can identify breakpoints of streamflow caused by the construction of dams to separate the pre impact period from the post impact period 2 comparing the streamflow in periods before and after the construction of dss mezger et al 2020 investigated dam induced hr alteration in four river basins in spain by comparing pre and post dam instream flow patterns 3 comparing the streamflow in periods affected by different numbers of dss with the unregulated period as the baseline timpe and kaplan 2017 xu et al 2020 investigated potential changes in the transborder total phosphorus flux from the lancang river basin based on a no dam reference scenario and various types of dam construction scenarios most of these studies are based on the assumption that departures from the natural flow regime can be expected to result in the degradation of river ecosystems pal and sarda 2020 despite these efforts the impact of multiple dss has remained inadequately assessed first few studies have investigated the integrated effects and contribution of multiple dss on hr ef as the number of dss increases especially their impacts at different locations in the basin i e upstream midstream or downstream leaving several fundamental questions unsolved for example river flow including magnitude duration timing frequency and rate of change is altered significantly as the number of dss built on the river increases if so which aspect of the river flow will change more significantly second the impact of dss was less separated from climate variability and land use change in previous studies especially the latter this is critical for a better understanding of ds induced hr ef alteration since streamflow observations in ds dominated basins are comprehensively impacted by climate variability dss and land use change kim et al 2013 based on the problems mentioned above the purpose of this study is to propose a framework for assessing the impact of integrated regulation with different numbers of multiple dss on the alteration in hr ef by separating disturbances from climate variability and land use change based on streamflow observations and hydrological modeling the specific objectives included 1 to investigate the alteration in hr ef with the increasing number of dss 2 to separate the effects of dss on flow regime from climate variability and land use change using hydrological models and 3 to compare the contribution of dss climate variability and land use change to flow regime alteration to achieve these objectives a framework was proposed by considering the ds dominated shaying river basin srb as a case study two hydrological stations located in the middle and lower reaches of the basin were selected the hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat and streamflow observations were used jointly to generate three streamflow datasets streamflow affected by climate variability land use change and dss to separate the effects of dss on the flow regime from climate variability and land use change a hydrological model is required for the following reasons normally measured streamflow data are sufficient for investigating the hr ef effects of human activity and climate change this is the research idea followed by many current studies as described above however the contributions of human activities mainly land use change and dss in this study and climate change to hr ef need to be separated to study their respective impacts on hr ef hydrological models such as the swat model can simulate hydrological processes under different climate and human activity scenarios based on different data inputs furthermore the swat model has been widely used to assess ds induced hr ef alterations in previous studies by combining the iha lópez ballesteros et al 2020 brouziyne et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the details of the swat application in this study are provided in sections 2 3 and 2 6 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area as well as the methods and data used section 3 presents details on the results of alteration in hr ef affected by different numbers of dss as well as the contribution of dss climate variability and land use change to alteration in the flow regime the results and limitations of this study are discussed in section 4 and conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the shaying river with a total length of approximately 621 km and a drainage area of approximately 39 075 km2 is the largest tributary of the huai river luo et al 2018 the geographical location of the basin is shown in fig 1 the annual average temperature of the basin ranges from 14 to 15 c he et al 2019 the annual average precipitation is approximately 753 mm hao et al 2022 a large amount of agricultural industrial and household water use causes severe water shortages li et al 2020 yan et al 2022 luo and zuo 2019 to meet the water resource demand of the region many dss have been built in the basin since the 1950 s li et al 2022 yan et al 2022 however the construction of dss also leads to serious hydrological and ecological impacts ma et al 2019 seven major dss including two dams the zhaopingtai and baiguishan reservoirs and five sluices the mawan zhoukou huaidian fuyang and yingshang sluices were built on the mainstream basin fig 1 these dss were used as the research subjects in the study the construction times and characteristics of these dss are summarized in table 1 the construction date information for some dss on the tributaries of the shaying river in fig 1 is also listed in table 1 data were provided by the huai river commission of the ministry of water resources streamflow observations at the zhoukou and fuyang stations during 1954 2013 daily data were provided by the hydrological yearbook of the huai river basin they were used to 1 calibrate hydrological models and 2 calculate indicators of hr ef at different ds regulation periods meteorological and geospatial data were used to derive a hydrological model meteorological data including rainfall relative humidity temperature solar radiation and wind were provided by the national meteorological information center of china https data cma cn geospatial data included a digital elevation model dem and land use and soil data the dem data with a spatial resolution of 30 m were obtained from the geospatial data cloud site https www gscloud cn and land use data for 2000 and 2010 with a spatial resolution of 30 m were obtained from the national geomatics center of china https www globallandcover com soil data with a spatial resolution of 1 km were provided by the resource and environment science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn 2 2 study periods and framework fig 2 shows the flowchart for assessing alterations in hr ef affected by different numbers of multiple dss based on observed and simulated streamflow it includes four main steps identifying the pre impact period and the post impact sub periods step 1 in fig 2 obtaining flow series affected by climate variability and land use change in post impact sub periods step 2 in fig 2 obtaining flow series forced by dss in post impact sub periods step 3 in fig 2 and comparing alterations in hr ef due to dss in different post impact sub periods step 4 in fig 2 the core of the proposed flowchart is to 1 separate the effects of dss on hr ef from climate variability and land use change steps 2 and 3 in fig 2 and 2 investigate the impact of multiple dss on hr ef as the number of dss increases step 4 in fig 2 these four steps are described in detail below first we identify the pre and post impact sub periods step 1 in fig 2 to compare the alteration in hr ef affected by different numbers of dss the study period was divided into pre and post impact regulation periods and the post impact period was further divided into three ds affected scenarios the post impact sub periods according to the number and construction times of the dss table 2 there are four periods fig 2 including period 1 from 1954 to 1963 the pre impact period with negligible human intervention period 2 from 1964 to 1975 corresponding to scenario 1 a total of five dss were built on the mainstream and some dss which produced secondary impacts on mainstream streamflow were built in the tributaries period 3 from 1976 to 1996 corresponding to scenario 2 a total of seven dss were built on the mainstream and some dss were newly built in the tributaries and period 4 from 1997 to 2013 corresponding to scenario 3 a total of seven dss were built on the mainstream none of which were newly built however some dss were newly built in the tributaries in addition to the construction times of the dss the length of time series required by the iha and the indicators of ecosurplus and ecodeficit at least 15 years based on previous studies is another important reason for selecting split points in the division of post impact periods kennard et al 2010 fantin cruz et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 the zhaopingtai and yingshang sluices were built in 1959 and 1962 upstream and downstream of the srb respectively although they inevitably had an impact on streamflow during the period 1954 1963 the period was selected as the pre impact period because 1 1954 was the first year for which we could obtain a complete data record in the study area the application of iha and range of variability approach rva methods require a long time series of streamflow observations at least 15 years based on previous studies kennard et al 2010 fantin cruz et al 2015 2 the zhaopingtai reservoir and yingshang sluice are far away from the zhoukou and fuyang stations fig 1 therefore we assume that their regulatory effects on the alteration in hr ef at the zhoukou and fuyang stations can be ignored the year 1975 was selected as a time point to separate the assessment period because both the zhoukou and huaidian sluices were built this year which is very important for assessing the change in impact as the number of dss increases the year 1996 was selected as another time point to double check whether the alteration of the hr ef was affected by the dss during different periods with new ds constructions second we obtained the flow series affected by climate variability and land use change in the post impact sub periods step 2 in fig 2 to this end a hydrological model is needed for each period the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods in this study to simulate the streamflow affected by climate variability and land use change in each post impact sub period discussed in the next paragraph streamflow simulated by the model with the input of climate and land use datasets in the pre impact period pre land use driven model is considered to be only affected by climate variability factors streamflow simulated by models with inputs of climate dataset in the pre impact period and land use dataset in each post impact sub period post land use driven model is considered to be affected by both climate and land use change factors the difference in streamflow simulated by the pre land use driven model and each post land use driven model was used to represent the impact of land use change on streamflow in the post impact sub period in this study two distributed hydrological models were constructed using swat to obtain the flow series discussed in the previous paragraph they are driven by the same climate datasets in the pre impact period and different land use datasets in 2000 and 2010 respectively we used land use datasets from 2000 to 2010 because of the limited data available in the basin the year 2000 was the first land use dataset that could be obtained in the basin we assumed that land use in 2000 was not affected by human activities and applied it to hydrological modeling in the pre impact period therefore the first model model one was prepared based on the land use dataset in 2000 and was calibrated and validated based on the observed streamflow in the pre impact period from 1954 to 1963 with negligible human impact the first two years from 1954 to 1955 were used to warm up the model and the periods 1956 1960 and 1961 1963 were used to calibrate and validate the model respectively as the effects of human activities on streamflow were ignored during 1954 1963 the streamflow simulated by model one from 1964 to 2013 was assumed to be only affected by climate variability factors the second model model two was built based on the land use dataset of 2010 it had the same meteorological data input and was assigned the same model parameter values as model one the difference in streamflow simulated by the two models can be used to represent the impact of land use change on streamflow because the two models were built in the period without ds influence and land use data input was the only difference between them third we obtain the flow series forced by the dss in the post impact sub periods step 3 in fig 2 based on the flow series affected by climate variability and land use change the flow series affected by dss in the i th post impact sub period denoted as qds i can be approximately estimated by a simple mathematical operation between streamflow observations affected by dss climate variability and land use change denoted as qo i streamflow affected by climate variability denoted as qc i and streamflow affected by land use change denoted as δql i q ds i q o i δ q l i q c i see section 2 6 finally we compared the alterations in hr ef due to dss in different post impact sub periods step 4 in fig 2 we calculated the iha as well as the ecohydrological indicators of ecosurplus and ecodeficit in each post impact sub period subsequently their comparison in different post impact sub periods was carried out to achieve our research purposes with respect to the iha hydrologic alteration factors haf in the low middle and high categories of hydrologic variability range and hydrologic alteration degree had were calculated using the rva in different post impact sub periods see methods in section 2 4 by comparing the changes in iha haf and had in different post impact sub periods at annual and seasonal scales the effects of the increasing number of dss on the hydrological regime can be revealed with respect to ecohydrological indicators ecosurplus and ecodeficit were calculated based on flow duration curves fdc in each post impact sub period with the pre impact period as a reference by comparing the ecosurplus and ecodeficit in different post impact sub periods the effects of the increasing number of dss on ef can also be revealed see section 2 5 2 3 swat model the swat model is a physically based semi distributed hydrological model that has been widely used to reveal instream hydrological variations neitsch et al 2011 pang et al 2020 devia et al 2015 el nasr et al 2005 li et al 2010 gassman et al 2014 the simulation of runoff in the swat model is divided into two stages a land stage that controls the amount of water sediment nutrients and pesticide loadings to the main channel in each sub basin and a routing stage that controls the movement of water sediments nutrients and pesticide loadings to the basin outlet by routing in the channel network shivhare et al 2018 gao et al 2018 luo and shao 2022 the water balance equation of the model is as follows neitsch et al 2011 igder et al 2022 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where s w t and s w 0 are the final and initial soil water content respectively t is the time and r day q surf e a ω seep and q gw are the amount of precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration percolation and return flow on day i respectively the key steps of the modeling processes in the swat model include watershed delineation based on dem hydrologic response unit hru analysis based on land use soil and slope data and weather data preparation abbaspour et al 2015 dos santos et al 2022 shivhare et al 2018 tuo et al 2016 in this study 48 sub basins were divided based on the threshold of the upstream drainage area the smaller the specified upstream drainage area threshold the more the sub basins will be divided and the modeling process will be more complex and time consuming swain et al 2022 according to the land use soil and slope data in the srb 325 hrus were obtained each sub basin includes multiple hrus each hru corresponded to a unique combination of land use soil and slope classes hydrological analysis of swat was first performed in each hru the generated runoff then converges to the outlets of the sub basins and eventually to the outlet of the study area based on empirical and physical formulas describing the complex runoff generation and confluence processes arnold et al 2012 lee et al 2022 luo and shao 2022 the specific modeling processes of swat are detailed in the swat user s guide winchell et al 2013 the performance of the swat model was quantified statistically using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pb and coefficient of determination r2 ma et al 2019 both the indicators of nse and r2 vary between 0 and 1 the greater these values the better the simulation results in general for nse 0 65 r 2 0 7 and pb 25 the simulation is considered representative 2 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 pb i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i 100 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where n is the number of observed monthly flow rate data oi and si are the observed and simulated flow rates at time i respectively and o and s are the averages of the observed and simulated flow rates respectively 2 4 flow regime indicators and assessment methods 2 4 1 indicators of hydrological alterations the iha proposed by richter et al 1996 have been widely used to reveal the effects of human activities dam and sluice regulation water diversions and groundwater pumping on hr based on streamflow in pre and post impact periods it includes 33 statistical parameters divided into five categories magnitude duration timing frequency and rate of change table 3 these indicators were calculated using daily flow data we used the iha software version 7 1 0 10 the nature conservancy 2009 for the calculations 2 4 2 range of variability approach the rva based on iha was used to quantify the change in streamflow affected by human activities the iha in the pre impact period were used as references to obtain the initial environmental flow goals and assess the alteration in the hr induced by human activities the nature conservancy 2009 for each iha three hafs in the low 0 24 middle 25 75 and high 76 100 categories were calculated based on the actual and expected frequency of the post impact iha values falling within corresponding categories in the pre impact period the specific steps for calculating hafs are summarized as follows first non parametric statistics percentile were used to divide the pre impact period into three different categories with 25 and 75 as the percentile thresholds as the pre impact period was used as the reference for defining the extent to which natural flow regimes have been altered this yields three categories the lowest category contains all values less than or equal to the 25th percentile the middle category contains all values falling in the 25th to 75th percentiles and the highest category contains all values greater than the 75th percentile second we calculate the expected frequency with which the post impact values of the iha should fall within each category see the calculation method of n e in eq 5 with the middle category as an example third we compute the frequency with which the post impact annual values of the iha fell within each of the three categories see the explanation of n i in eq 6 with the middle category as an example finally a haf value can be calculated for each of the three categories based on n i and n e using the simple mathematical method in eq 6 see the calculation of d i in eq 6 with the middle category as an example details of the calculation of hafs are provided in the user s manual of the iha the nature conservancy 2009 according to zhang et al 2015 the haf in the middle category of each iha is defined as the had of the indicator for quantifying the alteration in the hr affected by the regulation of dss the calculation of had for each iha is shown in eqs 5 and 6 the integrated had was calculated using eq 7 5 n e r n t 6 d i n i n e n e 100 7 d 0 1 n i 1 33 d i 2 where d i is the hydrological alteration factor for each iha n i is the number of years of the post impact i t h iha that falls within the rva goal range from 25 to 75 mentioned above based on the pre impact period n e is the number of expected years of the i t h iha that falls within the rva goal range r is the ratio of the number of years of the pre impact i t h iha that falls within the rva goal range to total years 50 is recommended in many other studies zhang et al 2015 n t is the total number of years in the post impact period 2 5 ecosurplus and ecodeficit indicators ecosurplus and ecodeficit proposed by vogel et al 2007 based on fdcs which reflect the relationship between the daily ordered streamflow observations q i and their exceeding probability p i i n 1 where n is the number of days and i is the rank are important nondimensional metrics for river ef assessment regarding the quantification of these two indices the fdc in the reference period the pre impact period from 1954 to 1963 was plotted first and then the fdcs in different post impact sub periods were plotted in the same graph as the fdc in the reference period the area below the pre impact fdc curve and above the post impact fdc curve shows the amount of water that cannot be used to meet instream flow requirements currently owing to the regulation of dss and the ratio of this area to the total area of the pre impact fdc curve was defined as ecodeficit see gao et al 2009 for detail similarly ecosurplus is the ratio of the area below the post impact fdc curve and above the pre impact fdc curve to the total area of the pre impact fdc curve we calculated ecosurplus and ecodeficit at temporal scales of the season spring from march to may summer from june to august autumn from september to november winter from december to february and year based on annual and seasonal fdcs to analyze the annual and seasonal effects of multiple dss on ef 2 6 contributions of dss to flow changes the streamflow alteration induced by the regulation of dss should be separated from climate variability and land use change before studying the contribution of dss to streamflow alteration in ds dominated basins because dss and land use are two different types of human activities affecting changes in streamflow the mathematical method for separating the impact of dss on streamflow from climate variability and land use change was simply represented as follows the total change in streamflow in the i t h post impact sub period scenarios 1 3 caused by climate variability and human activities δ q t i was calculated based on the observed mean annual streamflow q o i in the i t h post impact sub period and the observed mean annual streamflow in the pre impact period q ou δ q t i q o i q ou δ q c i δ q h i where δ q c i and δ q h i indicate the change in mean annual streamflow affected by climate variability and human activities in the i t h period respectively yang et al 2020b the alteration in streamflow caused by climate variability in the i t h post impact sub period δ q c i was calculated based on the mean annual streamflow in the pre impact period q ou and the simulated mean annual streamflow in the i t h post impact sub period q s 1 i using model one section 2 2 and δ q c i q s 1 i q ou dey and mishra 2017 the alteration in streamflow caused by human activity in the i t h post impact sub period δ q h i was calculated based on δ q t i and δ q c i δ q h i δ q t i δ q c i dey and mishra 2017 the alteration of streamflow caused by land use change δ q l i was calculated using the difference in mean annual streamflow simulated by the model q s 1 i and the model two q s 2 i since land use is the only difference between them in terms of data input and model parameters δ q l i q s 2 i q s 1 i therefore the dss that caused alterations in streamflow in the i t h post impact sub period δ q ds i can be calculated as δ q ds i δ q h i δ q l i δ q t i δ q c i δ q l i the degree of contribution of dss climate variability and land use change to alterations in streamflow can be calculated as 8 c ds i δ q ds i δ q ds i δ q c i δ q oth i 100 9 c l i δ q l i δ q ds i δ q c i δ q l i 100 10 c c i δ q c i δ q ds i δ q c i δ q l i 100 where c ds i c c i and c l i indicate the degree of contribution of dss climate variability and land use change to changes in streamflow in the i t h period respectively 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation the measured streamflow at zhoukou and fuyang stations located midstream and downstream of the srb as well as three typical metrics r2 pb and nse were used to evaluate the performance of the swat model constructed in this study swat cup software was used to calibrate the hydrological models after four iterations each iteration included 500 simulations for adjusting model parameters the r2 pb and nse values reached 0 73 3 36 and 0 71 at the zhoukou station and 0 79 1 40 and 0 75 at the fuyang station in the calibration period the r2 pb and nse values were 0 81 15 85 and 0 78 at the zhoukou station and 0 77 18 79 and 0 70 at the fuyang station in the validation period showing a goodness of fit between model simulation values and observations we attempted more iterations however the model performance did not improve further according to previous studies and swat cup documentation four iterations including 500 simulations are sufficient to reach an acceptable solution tejaswini and sathian 2018 therefore the accuracy of the constructed model was satisfactory fig 3 a b 3 2 comparison in streamflow affected by climate variability and dss to quantify the impact of dss on streamflow as the number of dss increases we built two distributed hydrologic models models one and two mentioned in section 2 2 to derive the streamflow affected by land use change denoted by δ q l i and quantified by the difference in streamflow simulated by the two models section 2 6 for details therefore the streamflow affected by both climate variability and dss in the i t h post impact sub period q c c d s i can be derived using the difference between the measured streamflow q o i and δ q l i q c c d s i q o i δ q l i we then compared the change in streamflow simulated by model one representing the impact of climate variability q c i and q c c d s i in our designed three post impact sub periods the results are plotted in fig 3c d table 4 shows the monthly average streamflow of q c and q c c d s denoted as q c and q c c d s respectively under different scenarios at the zhoukou and fuyang stations according to the table the simulated monthly average streamflow by model one in the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods as scenarios 1 to 3 were 130 12 117 55 101 55 and 123 62 m3 s respectively at the zhoukou station q c in table 4 the monthly average streamflow affected by both climate variability and dss q c c d s in table 4 were 130 38 m3 s in the pre impact period 115 46 m3 s in scenario 1 79 98 m3 s in scenario 2 and 89 39 m3 s in scenario 3 respectively therefore the difference in streamflow affected by climate variability only and by both climate variability and dss in the pre impact period was very small with a value of 0 26 m3 s this shows that the alteration in streamflow caused by human activities is negligible during the pre impact period at the zhoukou station however the differences in monthly average streamflow simulated by model one q c and q c c d s representing the streamflow affected by dss showed an increasing trend from scenarios 1 to 3 with values of 2 09 m3 s 21 57 m3 s and 34 23 m3 s showing that streamflow was decreased as the number of dss increased the simulated monthly average streamflow by model one in the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods for scenarios 1 to 3 were 185 19 171 41 161 13 and 189 88 m3 s respectively at the fuyang station where the corresponding monthly average streamflow values of q c c d s were 191 82 163 41 111 22 and 125 29 m3 s respectively table 4 the differences in monthly average streamflow simulated by model one and q c c d s at the fuyang station were 8 00 49 91 and 64 59 m3 s from scenarios 1 to 3 table 4 therefore the results of streamflow at the fuyang station showed a similar decrease in variation as that of the zhoukou station as the number of dss increased however the difference between q c and q c c d s in the pre impact period with a value of 6 63 m3 s was close to that in scenario 1 with a value of 8 00 m3 s at the fuyang station table 4 indicating that the impact of human activities on streamflow was not significantly different between the two periods in addition the difference between q c and q c c d s in the pre impact period at the fuyang station is greater than that at the zhoukou station with a value of 0 26 m3 s therefore streamflow in the pre impact period at the fuyang station is more seriously affected by human activities than that at the zhoukou station because the streamflow of the pre impact period was used as the benchmark natural streamflow to assess alterations in hr ef induced by dss in this study the results of this study will be limited by the selection of the pre impact period at the fuyang station 3 3 alteration in the iha in different periods affected by dss the iha were calculated based on streamflow affected by climate variability in the pre impact period and by both climate variability and dss in three post impact sub periods in the srb to derive hafs affected by dss fig 4 a f shows the monthly mean streamflow in the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods at the zhoukou and fuyang stations it can be seen that monthly mean streamflow in the high flow months may september in the post impact sub periods was significantly reduced compared with that in the pre impact period the average of streamflow in fig 4 from may to september in the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods is 233 69 173 32 130 91 and 138 10 m3 s respectively at the zhoukou station and 359 28 258 77 175 46 and 198 49 m3 s respectively at the fuyang station this shows that the dss have a significant regulating effect on high flow by comparing the streamflow in the three post impact sub periods it can be seen that the monthly mean streamflow reduction in both scenarios 2 and 3 with values of 130 91 and 138 10 m3 s at the zhoukou station and 175 46 and 198 49 m3 s at the fuyang station was greater than that in scenario 1 with values of 173 32 and 258 77 m3 s at the zhoukou and fuyang stations respectively in the high flow months related to the pre impact period it can be concluded that with an increase in the number of dss the reduction effect of dss on streamflow in the high flow months is strengthened focusing on the spatial scale the difference in the monthly mean streamflow between the post impact sub periods and their corresponding pre impact periods in the high flow months was greater at the fuyang station with values of 100 51 183 82 and 160 79 m3 s than that at the zhoukou station with values of 60 37 102 78 and 95 59 m3 s respectively fig 5 a f shows the results of the analysis of variance anova at the zhoukou and fuyang stations anova was used to measure the dispersion of the iha caused by the regulation effects of dss the coefficient of variance cv is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean where and are the standard deviation and the mean of the time series respectively the higher the cv the greater the level of dispersion around the mean stigler 1986 according to fig 5a b the cv values of streamflow in the post impact sub periods from scenarios 1 to 3 were greater than that in the pre impact period in most high and low flow months this was more obvious in the low flow months at the zhoukou station where all the cv values in the post impact sub periods were greater than that in the pre impact period fig 5a however the differences in cv between the post impact and pre impact periods in the low flow months were greater than that in the high flow months at both the zhoukou and fuyang stations fig 5a b indicating that the regulation effect of dss on low flow is greater than that on high flow in the srb the regulation of dss made the dispersion of high flow smaller which tends to reduce from scenarios 1 to 3 as the number of dss increases that is with the increase in the number of dss the changes in streamflow become more regular as discussed in another work that showed that the regulation of dss makes the flow curve smooth the discharge flow concentrated and the peak flow reduced and has a great impact over river hydrological conditions luo et al 2020 according to fig 5 c f not all the iha changed greatly with the increase in the number of dss for some indicators like the 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day 90 day maximum and date of maximum fig 5c d the difference in cv between the pre impact and post impact periods is small this may be related to the degree of rivers regulated by dss because highly artificially regulated rivers make the changes of flow more regular as discussed above fig 6 a f shows hafs calculated based on the iha in the low middle and high rva categories according to fig 6a f the iha in the low and high rva categories changed greatly compared with that in the middle rva category at both the zhoukou fig 6a c and e and fuyang fig 6b d and f stations indicating that integrated regulation of multiple dss had a high impact on extreme flows high and low flows in detail most iha in the low rva category changed positively 23 29 and 29 iha changed positively in scenarios 1 3 at the zhoukou station respectively accounting for 70 88 and 88 of the total metrics 15 26 and 26 iha changed positively in scenarios 1 3 at the fuyang station respectively accounting for 45 79 and 79 of the total metrics while most iha in the high rva category changed negatively 16 25 and 21 iha changed negatively in scenarios 1 3 at the zhoukou station respectively accounting for 48 76 and 64 of the total metrics 18 23 and 22 iha changed negatively in scenarios 1 3 at the fuyang station respectively accounting for 55 70 and 67 of the total metrics by comparing the changes of the iha metrics in low and high rva categories we found that 1 regulation of dss increases the frequency of low flow and decreases the frequency of high flow and the alteration of low flow caused by dss is greater than that of high flow in the srb more iha metrics are positively altered in the low rva category than that negatively altered in the high rva category 2 the proportion of positive iha to total iha in the low rva category is not changed greatly from scenarios 2 to 3 at the zhoukou and fuyang stations 3 the proportion of negative iha to total iha in the high rva category is decreased slightly from scenarios 2 to 3 at the zhoukou and fuyang stations the alteration of the iha at the zhoukou station in different scenarios showed that scenario 2 with average absolute haf values of 1 52 0 33 and 0 92 in the low middle and high rva categories was greater than that in scenario 3 with corresponding values of 1 12 0 23 0 99 and the latter values were greater than those in scenario 1 with corresponding values of 0 711 0 221 and 0 711 at the zhoukou station fig 6a c and d the greater hr alteration in scenario 3 compared to that in scenario 1 indicates that increased ds construction contributes to the alteration of the hr the alteration of the iha at the fuyang station showed that scenario 3 with average absolute haf values of 1 14 0 44 and 1 18 in the low middle and high rva categories was greater than that in scenario 2 with corresponding values of 0 83 0 30 and 0 92 and the latter values were greater than those in scenario 1 with corresponding values of 0 70 0 30 and 0 66 fig 6b d and f the alteration of streamflow in the order of scenario 3 scenario 2 scenario 1 at the fuyang station verified our conclusion at the zhoukou station that more ds construction contributes to the alteration of the hr for each iha in fig 6a f the frequencies of the 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day minimum increased in the low rva category moreover the increase was largest in scenario 2 followed by scenarios 3 and 1 at the zhoukou station a similar change in the frequencies of these iha occurred in the low rva category at the fuyang station however the order of the increase was scenario 3 scenario 2 scenario 1 the frequencies of these indicators in the middle and high rva categories decreased in the post impact sub periods compared with those in the pre impact period except for scenario 2 at the fuyang station this further verified that the regulation of the dss increased the frequency of low flow the frequencies of the indicators of the 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day maximum increased in the low and middle rva categories while their frequencies decreased in the high rva categories in the post impact sub periods compared with those in the pre impact period this showed that the regulation of the dss decreased the frequency of high flow table 5 presents the results for the integrated had it can be seen that the integrated monthly average had of 42 27 at the zhoukou station in scenario 2 was greater than that in scenarios 1 and 3 with values of 26 79 and 29 61 respectively however the integrated monthly average had at the fuyang station showed that scenario 3 with a value of 53 50 was greater than that in scenarios 1 and 2 with values of 37 51 and 38 12 respectively the integrated alteration degree at the fuyang station was greater than that at the zhoukou station except in scenario 2 in which the zhoukou sluice was newly built in the period and produced a direct impact on streamflow 3 4 ecosurplus and ecodeficit changes affected by dss the annual and seasonal ecosurpluses and ecodeficits are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively it can be seen that the ecodeficit was greater than the ecosurplus in the three post impact sub periods from scenarios 1 to 3 at both the zhoukou and fuyang stations these results indicate that the construction of the dss reduced the ef in the basin the ecodeficit increased from scenario 1 with values of 39 85 and 15 94 at the zhoukou and fuyang stations to scenario 2 with values of 58 34 and 42 21 and scenario 3 with values of 53 42 and 34 84 on the annual scale this indicates that the increasing number of dss from scenarios 1 to 3 had a negative impact on ef the seasonal variation of the ecosurplus and ecodeficit in fig 8 shows that the ecodeficit mainly occurred in summer and winter in the three ds scenarios at the zhoukou and fuyang stations it was also serious in spring except in scenario 1 with values of 4 69 and 1 98 at the zhoukou and fuyang stations respectively however the ecodeficit in autumn was not as serious as that in spring summer and winter at both the zhoukou and fuyang stations this indicates that the regulation of dss had a great influence on ef in spring summer and winter while the influence in autumn was relatively small therefore the seasonal ecodeficit in scenario 2 was the largest followed by scenario 3 and it was the smallest in scenario 1 at the zhoukou and fuyang stations the larger ecodeficit in scenarios 2 and 3 compared with scenario 1 concluded that the construction of dss contributed to the decline in ef as the number of dss increases their impact on the ef increases 3 5 contribution of dss to streamflow variation the contributions of climate variability dss and land use change to the alteration in streamflow in table 6 show that the contribution of dss increased from scenarios 1 to 3 with values of 37 32 45 51 and 73 13 at the zhoukou station and 51 06 66 52 and 89 59 at the fuyang station respectively in scenario 1 the contribution of dss to alterations in streamflow was low but still greater than the contributions of climate variability and land use change however the contribution of the dss to the alteration in streamflow increased significantly in scenarios 2 and 3 it can be seen that dss played a dominant role in the alteration of streamflow because their contribution degrees were near or greater than 50 this showed that human activities related to the regulation of dss in the srb were important factors affecting alterations in streamflow table 6 shows that the contribution of dss to the alteration in streamflow at the fuyang station located downstream of the srb was greater than that at the zhoukou station located midstream of the basin indicating a greater impact of dss on streamflow downstream than midstream 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of dss on hr ef streamflow between upstream and downstream river sections is closely linked to natural rivers without human intervention therefore river flow affected by upstream dams and other impoundments influences downstream flow rates magnitudes and frequencies of occurrence jiang et al 2019 yaghmaei et al 2018 in our study the alteration of the iha at the zhoukou station showed that the impacts of dss on hr ef in scenario 2 from 1976 to 1996 was greater than that in scenarios 1 and 3 the ecodeficit at the zhoukou station also showed similar characteristics according to the results in section 3 4 the streamflow at the zhoukou station was affected by the four dss in scenario 2 table 2 one of them was newly built in the beginning year of the period zhoukou sluice built in 1975 and the remaining three were built before the period of consideration zhaopingtai in 1959 baiguishan in 1966 and mawan in 1966 see fig 1 in scenario 1 three dss affected the streamflow at the zhoukou station similar to scenario 2 there are also four dss affecting streamflow in scenario 3 at the zhoukou station no new dss were built on the mainstream of the basin in scenario 3 the largest flow regime alteration in scenario 2 may have been caused by the newly constructed zhoukou sluice which had a direct impact on streamflow however a series of anthropogenic regulations and environmental protection measures such as environmental laws and regulations likely mitigated the effects of the flow regime and ecodeficit induced by the dss in scenario 3 compared with those in scenario 2 the huai river basin the shaying river is the largest tributary of the huai river was the first in china to have a comprehensive water pollution control program bai and shi 2006 zhai et al 2014 initiated and led by the central government in 1994 the huai river pollution control plan was the largest single river basin pollution abatement campaign in china with a 10 year total investment estimate of more than 60 billion chinese renminbi yuan cny or approximately us 8 billion bai and shi 2006 in june 1994 the state environmental protection bureau the ministry of water resources and the four provinces along the river jointly promulgated the decision on preventing pollution emergencies of water courses in the huai river basin trial zhong 2006 in august 1995 the state council enacted china s first basin wide water pollution control laws and regulations interim regulations on the prevention and control of water pollution in the huai river basin xia et al 2011 the implementation of a series of ecological protection measures mitigated the impact of dss on the flow regime and ecodeficit in the basin to further compare the ecodeficits in different scenarios we plotted the temporal variation of average daily streamflow and the corresponding frequency of occurrence from 1956 to 2013 a total of 58 years in the zhoukou station fig 9 we used 75 as the threshold of frequency of occurrence corresponding to the average daily streamflow of 49 m3 s to select low flow years in each scenario 75 was determined subjectively based on research data for analysis purposes the results showed that 14 of the 58 years 1956 2013 had an average daily flow of less than 49 m3 s among them eight years occurred in scenario 2 1976 1996 and four years occurred in scenario 3 1997 2013 according to fig 9 the streamflow in the years 1986 1988 and 1992 1995 in scenario 2 is smaller than that in other years therefore the low flow years in scenario 2 relative to those in scenarios 1 and 3 are an important reason for the severe ecodeficit in scenario 2 our findings also showed that the regulation of dss altered the iha in the low below 25 of daily flows in the pre impact period and high above 75 of daily flows in the pre impact period rva categories compared to the middle rva category fig 6 this indicates that the dss had a high impact on extreme low and high flows for the former the frequency of occurrence of low flow increased and the fluctuation of low flow changes was more obvious than that in the pre impact period for the latter the frequency of the occurrence of high flow decreased in our study this reflects the reduction effect of ds regulation on flood peaks and their regulation of low flow these results are consistent with the regulation rules for dss this is the pre release and re storage process of reservoirs when a flood occurs which contributes to the reduction of peak flow dang et al 2022 peng et al 2022 multiple dss make flood regulation more significant owing to their cascading effects our results at the fuyang station showed that the impact of dss on the monthly average streamflow alteration in scenario 1 was not significantly different from that in the pre impact period specifically the monthly average streamflow alteration in scenario 1 was slightly greater than that in the pre impact period this result is based on a comparison of the monthly average streamflow the average streamflow from january to december between the two periods a further comparison of changes in monthly streamflow fig 4b showed that monthly streamflow changed differently between the two periods at the fuyang station showing an increasing low flow and a decreasing high flow from the pre impact period to scenario 1 this shows that the dss in scenario 1 mainly play the role of regulating extreme flows as discussed above the increased low flow and decreased high flow were the main reasons for the small difference in the monthly average streamflow between the two periods another possible reason is the impact of the dss on the tributaries of the shaying river some dss were constructed during the pre impact period table 1 such as the loudi sluice constructed on the fenquan river in 1960 this means that streamflow in the pre impact period is also affected by the dss at the fuyang station in addition the variation in monthly streamflow at fuyang station revealed that streamflow variation in scenario 3 was almost the same as that in scenario 2 and both affected by six dss were greater than those in scenario 1 affected by four dss similar variation characteristics of the iha in scenarios 2 and 3 were greater than those in scenario 1 at the zhoukou station indicating that the integrated regulation of multiple dss has a significant impact on streamflow and the effect increases as the number of dss increases the contribution of dss to hydrological alteration table 6 shows that the contribution of dss in scenarios 2 and 3 is greater than that in scenario 1 supporting the conclusion that the integrated regulation of dss in the srb has a great impact on streamflow as more dss are constructed during scenarios 2 and 3 than in scenario 1 4 2 limitations and application prospects of the proposed framework this section focuses on the limitations uncertainty of sources of the proposed framework owing to data availability and hydrological modeling and our suggestions for reducing uncertainties caused by these limitations when using it in other basins the limitations and corresponding suggestions are summarized as follows the first limitation is the availability of land use datasets according to the framework proposed in section 2 2 land use datasets in different study periods the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods are required to simulate flow series affected by climate variability and land use change respectively however obtaining land use datasets in the pre impact periods the construction of dss usually dates to the 1970 s in many basins is often difficult in many global basins because satellite remote sensing which is one of the main means of obtaining land use datasets matured in the 1970 s mcroberts et al 2010 therefore we chose a land use dataset later than the pre impact period as an alternative such as 2000 in this study this inevitably results in uncertainty to reduce the impact of land use data one land use dataset should be prepared for each study period for hydrological modeling as described in section 2 2 if land use data are available land use datasets from periods earlier than the 1970 s can be obtained through land use prediction models such as the patch generating land use simulation plus model and the markov chain cellular automata method halmy et al 2015 liang et al 2021 however these models themselves typically have uncertainties studying the impact of applying predicted land use data on the performance of the proposed method is a valuable research effort that needs to be further explored the second limitation was the design of the study on the one hand different numbers of years of hydrological records for each post impact sub period will affect the results of the iha directly such as mean flow in each month table 3 because the values of the iha change with the length of the data records in the post impact sub periods on the other hand the length of the hydrological records in the pre and post impact study periods insufficient length of time series often limits the application of iha and rva methods in most global basins as they require at least 15 years of pre and post impact streamflow data according to previous studies kennard et al 2010 fantin cruz et al 2015 for example richter et al 1997 recommended a data length greater than 20 years some studies have attempted to overcome the problem of data length by reconstructing the natural regime to extend the pre impact period but the post impact period cannot be easily extended because it is affected by both climate and human activities and is selected based on multiple factors such as the number and construction times of dss wang et al 2017 lu et al 2018 han et al 2019 timpe and kaplan 2017 characterized the uncertainty associated with the application of shorter record lengths when data are limited they found that a shorter record length is sufficient in several cases such as high flow and lowland rivers timpe and kaplan 2017 in this study we designed four study periods based on the number and construction times of dss the designed periods differ in the number of data records 10 years for the pre impact period and 12 21 and 17 years for the three post impact sub periods respectively due to limited streamflow observations in the study area this is one of the limitations affecting the results of this study therefore a data length greater than 15 years is required for each study period if the streamflow observations are sufficient additionally the length of the data records for each post impact period should be as equal as possible when designing the study period third climate and flow regimes in the pre impact period directly influence the conclusions of this study as the flow regime in the pre impact period was used as the reference to assess ds induced alteration in hr ef in the iha and rva methods in addition the hydrological models used in this study for simulating natural streamflow in post impact sub periods use climate datasets from the pre impact period as input therefore natural climatic variability and flow regimes are required during the pre impact period in other words the climate and flow regime in the pre impact period should not be affected by human activities relative to the post impact periods we usually choose pre dam sluice years with natural regime flows as the pre impact period the period before ds construction if the data length of the observed flow series is sufficient however in many cases the length of the observed flow data before ds construction is insufficient or incomplete for example the pre impact period designed in this study 1954 1963 includes two dss the zhaopingtai reservoir built in 1959 and the yingshang sluice built in 1962 although the results in section 3 2 showed that ds induced alterations in streamflow are small in the period at the zhoukou and fuyang stations they inevitably have an impact on the results of this research for example the difference in streamflow affected by climate variability only and by both climate variability and dss is 0 26 and 6 63 m3 s respectively they accounted for 0 2 and 4 3 of the monthly average streamflow in the period respectively therefore the selection of the pre impact period should fully consider the natural climate variability and flow regime relative to the post impact period as well as the length and completeness of the observed flow time series finally the streamflow simulated using the swat model was combined with observations to remove the impacts of climate variability and land use change to assess ds induced alterations in hr ef which inevitably brings about a certain amount of uncertainty caused by incorrect streamflow simulation simulated streamflow is needed because the observed streamflow in hydrological stations is comprehensively affected by multiple factors such as climate variability dss and land use change zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 hecht et al 2019 it is difficult to remove the effects of climate variability and land use change when assessing ds induced ef alterations based only on observations therefore hydrological models were employed in this study to simulate streamflow affected by climate variation and land use change see section 2 2 however the simulation error of streamflow due to factors such as land use and meteorological data input data accuracy spatial and temporal resolution integrity and spatial coverage and the calibration of model parameters will inevitably affect the results of hr ef assessment induced by dss in particular the calibration and validation periods of the hydrological model were relatively short five years were used to calibrate the models and three years were used to validate the models in this study because of the short data records in the pre impact period note that the simulation error of streamflow propagates step by step in the proposed method this will first affect the calculation accuracy of streamflow affected by climate variability and land use change which will be further applied to calculate streamflow affected by dss based on streamflow observations errors propagate during these processes the streamflow affected by dss will eventually be applied to assess the hr ef alterations induced by dss based on the iha and eco flow metrics errors propagate further in these processes to reduce the impact of error propagation we should focus on reducing the error sources caused during streamflow simulation by providing high quality meteorological and land use data as inputs for hydrological modeling for example remote sensing datasets with global coverage and high spatiotemporal resolution have been shown to improve the accuracy of streamflow simulations in the absence of meteorological data naseem et al 2016 ding and zhu 2022 luo et al 2022 using more observation sites to calibrate and validate hydrological models is also an effective approach for reducing errors in hydrological simulations 5 conclusions the primary objective of this study was to provide a framework for studying the impact of multiple dss as their number increases on the alteration in hr ef in dam dominated basins by separating disturbances from climate variability and land use change as a demonstration the framework was applied to an srb the hydrological models swat iha and indicators of ecosurplus and ecodeficit were employed to compare the alterations in hr ef induced by different numbers of dss the results showed that the integrated regulation of multiple dss affects the hr ef and the impact increases as the number of dss increases in particular the low and high flows were more seriously affected by the dss than the middle flow low middle and high flows are defined based on the 25th and 75th percentile thresholds of streamflow in the pre impact period see section 2 4 2 owing to the impact of the dss the frequency of occurrence of low flow increased and the frequency of occurrence of high flow decreased this reflects the reduction effect of dss regulation on flood peaks and their regulation of low flow nonetheless there is still a lack of systematic research and summary on how multiple dss affect hr ef alterations low middle and high flows in different spatial locations upstream midstream and downstream of basins this is a valuable research topic worth exploring because dss have different effects on hr ef at different spatial locations in basins the variation characteristics and differences in low middle and high flow in post impact periods relative to those in the pre impact period due to the construction of dss in ds dominated basins are also a valuable research topic the proposed framework can provide a reference for future research on these problems the proposed framework is effective but also limited by factors such as data availability and the division of study periods it is worth mentioning that the land use changes in this study were only taken from 2000 to 2010 because of the limited data available according to the framework proposed in section 2 2 more land use datasets should be considered therefore the conclusions obtained in this study may be partially biased by insufficient land use data and other factors stated in section 4 2 such as the selection of the pre impact period the application of the proposed framework to other basins should focus on the errors caused by these factors overall this study revealed the impact of different numbers of multiple dss on the hr ef at annual and seasonal scales the proposed framework can serve as a reference for separating the effects of dss climate variability and land use change on the hr ef in other ds dominated basins to improve the knowledge of the basin scale hydrological status it also helps to understand the relationship between the spatial distribution of the dss and their impacts on the flow regime credit authorship contribution statement zengliang luo conceptualization methodology software formal analysis data curation writing

2510,numerous studies have revealed dam and sluice ds induced modifications in the natural hydrologic regime and ecological flow hr ef by identifying the pre and post impact periods however few studies have separated the impacts of climate variability dss and land use change on the hr ef in rivers in addition the question of the integrated effect and contribution of multiple dss on hr ef as the number of dss increases and their position difference remains unanswered this study attempts to provide a framework for assessing the impact of integrated regulation with different numbers of multiple dss on the alterations in hr ef by separating disturbances from climate variability and land use change based on streamflow observations and hydrological modeling the shaying river basin srb one of the basins with the most severe ds regulations in china was selected as the study area for this case study the 33 flow regime indicators as well as the ecosurplus and ecodeficit indicators were applied to comprehensively reflect the impacts of multiple dss on hr ef the results indicated that dss contributed the most to the alterations in hr ef in the srb followed by climate variability whereas land use change contributed the least the integrated regulation of multiple dss has a significant effect on hr ef in rivers and this effect increases as the number of dss increases the low and high flows were more seriously affected by the dss than the middle flow resulting in an increase in the frequency of the low flow but an obvious decrease in the frequency of the high flow the seasonal variation in the ecodeficit showed that ecological flow during spring summer and winter was greater than that in autumn in the basin the proposed framework provides insights into the methodology for separating the impacts of climate variability dss and land use change on hr ef and is valuable in understanding the change in hr ef induced by different numbers of multiple dss at different locations

affecting the natural hydrologic regime and ecological flow hr ef in terms of magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of flow yang et al 2020a timpe and kaplan 2017 currently a large number of dss have been constructed worldwide and an increasing number of dss are continuously being constructed to meet the growing energy and water demands luo et al 2020 von schiller et al 2016 according to zhang et al 2017 the number of dams in the world is estimated to be greater than 16 million with a total storage volume of approximately 8000 km3 and millions of sluices total storage capacity 0 10 million m3 had been constructed globally the impacts of multiple dss on hr ef are more complicated than those of individual dss because of their irregular regulation as well as different numbers and spatial distributions shen et al 2022 lajoie et al 2007 a deeper understanding of the cumulative impact and contribution of multiple dss on hr ef as the number of dss increases can provide useful insights into integrated water resource management and ecological function protection in ds regulated basins barbarossa et al 2020 boulange et al 2021 note that hr ef in ds regulated basins is comprehensively affected by multiple factors such as climate variability dss and other types of human activities zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 hecht et al 2019 however to the best of our knowledge few studies have separated the impacts of climate variability dss and land use change on hr ef in rivers although this is critical for a better understanding of the impacts of dss on hr ef the selection of appropriate indicators is key to reflecting the alterations in hydrological and efs various indicators have been developed and introduced to describe the different aspects of hr wang et al 2021 the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha originally introduced by the nature conservancy and led by richter have been widely used to study alterations in hr affected by dss richter et al 1996 the iha use pre and post impact streamflow data to calculate 33 ecologically relevant indicators reflecting a wide range of hrs from magnitude duration timing and frequency to the rate of change richter et al 1996 lópez ballesteros et al 2020 szmańda et al 2021 furthermore ecosurplus and ecodeficit which are based on the flow duration curve are two commonly used comprehensive indicators for assessing changes in ef in hydrology research gao et al 2009 they represent the overall deficit or surplus of streamflow resulting from flow alteration and require at least 15 years of streamflow data both before and after the ds completion date he et al 2021 gao et al 2009 kennard et al 2010 fantin cruz et al 2015 based on these indices alterations in hr ef induced by multiple dss have been well documented worldwide song et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 jardim et al 2020 gao et al 2012 lin et al 2014 talukdar and pal 2017 song et al 2020 studied the impact of dams on hr changes in china using iha and zhou et al 2020 evaluated the cumulative impacts of cascade dams on the flow regime of the jinsha river by combining iha with the projection pursuit and real coded accelerated genetic algorithm jardim et al 2020 assessed the large scale hydrologic alteration in the south american pantanal due to upstream dam operation using iha furthermore some studies have analyzed changes in hr ef based on a combination of eco flow metrics ecosurplus and ecodeficit and iha gao et al 2012 lin et al 2014 talukdar and pal 2017 most recent studies have mainly focused on 1 identifying the pre and post impact periods using methods such as change point detection techniques to compare streamflow in periods before and after identified hydrological breakpoints cui et al 2020 pérez ciria et al 2019 showed that wavelet analysis can identify breakpoints of streamflow caused by the construction of dams to separate the pre impact period from the post impact period 2 comparing the streamflow in periods before and after the construction of dss mezger et al 2020 investigated dam induced hr alteration in four river basins in spain by comparing pre and post dam instream flow patterns 3 comparing the streamflow in periods affected by different numbers of dss with the unregulated period as the baseline timpe and kaplan 2017 xu et al 2020 investigated potential changes in the transborder total phosphorus flux from the lancang river basin based on a no dam reference scenario and various types of dam construction scenarios most of these studies are based on the assumption that departures from the natural flow regime can be expected to result in the degradation of river ecosystems pal and sarda 2020 despite these efforts the impact of multiple dss has remained inadequately assessed first few studies have investigated the integrated effects and contribution of multiple dss on hr ef as the number of dss increases especially their impacts at different locations in the basin i e upstream midstream or downstream leaving several fundamental questions unsolved for example river flow including magnitude duration timing frequency and rate of change is altered significantly as the number of dss built on the river increases if so which aspect of the river flow will change more significantly second the impact of dss was less separated from climate variability and land use change in previous studies especially the latter this is critical for a better understanding of ds induced hr ef alteration since streamflow observations in ds dominated basins are comprehensively impacted by climate variability dss and land use change kim et al 2013 based on the problems mentioned above the purpose of this study is to propose a framework for assessing the impact of integrated regulation with different numbers of multiple dss on the alteration in hr ef by separating disturbances from climate variability and land use change based on streamflow observations and hydrological modeling the specific objectives included 1 to investigate the alteration in hr ef with the increasing number of dss 2 to separate the effects of dss on flow regime from climate variability and land use change using hydrological models and 3 to compare the contribution of dss climate variability and land use change to flow regime alteration to achieve these objectives a framework was proposed by considering the ds dominated shaying river basin srb as a case study two hydrological stations located in the middle and lower reaches of the basin were selected the hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat and streamflow observations were used jointly to generate three streamflow datasets streamflow affected by climate variability land use change and dss to separate the effects of dss on the flow regime from climate variability and land use change a hydrological model is required for the following reasons normally measured streamflow data are sufficient for investigating the hr ef effects of human activity and climate change this is the research idea followed by many current studies as described above however the contributions of human activities mainly land use change and dss in this study and climate change to hr ef need to be separated to study their respective impacts on hr ef hydrological models such as the swat model can simulate hydrological processes under different climate and human activity scenarios based on different data inputs furthermore the swat model has been widely used to assess ds induced hr ef alterations in previous studies by combining the iha lópez ballesteros et al 2020 brouziyne et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the details of the swat application in this study are provided in sections 2 3 and 2 6 the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area as well as the methods and data used section 3 presents details on the results of alteration in hr ef affected by different numbers of dss as well as the contribution of dss climate variability and land use change to alteration in the flow regime the results and limitations of this study are discussed in section 4 and conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the shaying river with a total length of approximately 621 km and a drainage area of approximately 39 075 km2 is the largest tributary of the huai river luo et al 2018 the geographical location of the basin is shown in fig 1 the annual average temperature of the basin ranges from 14 to 15 c he et al 2019 the annual average precipitation is approximately 753 mm hao et al 2022 a large amount of agricultural industrial and household water use causes severe water shortages li et al 2020 yan et al 2022 luo and zuo 2019 to meet the water resource demand of the region many dss have been built in the basin since the 1950 s li et al 2022 yan et al 2022 however the construction of dss also leads to serious hydrological and ecological impacts ma et al 2019 seven major dss including two dams the zhaopingtai and baiguishan reservoirs and five sluices the mawan zhoukou huaidian fuyang and yingshang sluices were built on the mainstream basin fig 1 these dss were used as the research subjects in the study the construction times and characteristics of these dss are summarized in table 1 the construction date information for some dss on the tributaries of the shaying river in fig 1 is also listed in table 1 data were provided by the huai river commission of the ministry of water resources streamflow observations at the zhoukou and fuyang stations during 1954 2013 daily data were provided by the hydrological yearbook of the huai river basin they were used to 1 calibrate hydrological models and 2 calculate indicators of hr ef at different ds regulation periods meteorological and geospatial data were used to derive a hydrological model meteorological data including rainfall relative humidity temperature solar radiation and wind were provided by the national meteorological information center of china https data cma cn geospatial data included a digital elevation model dem and land use and soil data the dem data with a spatial resolution of 30 m were obtained from the geospatial data cloud site https www gscloud cn and land use data for 2000 and 2010 with a spatial resolution of 30 m were obtained from the national geomatics center of china https www globallandcover com soil data with a spatial resolution of 1 km were provided by the resource and environment science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn 2 2 study periods and framework fig 2 shows the flowchart for assessing alterations in hr ef affected by different numbers of multiple dss based on observed and simulated streamflow it includes four main steps identifying the pre impact period and the post impact sub periods step 1 in fig 2 obtaining flow series affected by climate variability and land use change in post impact sub periods step 2 in fig 2 obtaining flow series forced by dss in post impact sub periods step 3 in fig 2 and comparing alterations in hr ef due to dss in different post impact sub periods step 4 in fig 2 the core of the proposed flowchart is to 1 separate the effects of dss on hr ef from climate variability and land use change steps 2 and 3 in fig 2 and 2 investigate the impact of multiple dss on hr ef as the number of dss increases step 4 in fig 2 these four steps are described in detail below first we identify the pre and post impact sub periods step 1 in fig 2 to compare the alteration in hr ef affected by different numbers of dss the study period was divided into pre and post impact regulation periods and the post impact period was further divided into three ds affected scenarios the post impact sub periods according to the number and construction times of the dss table 2 there are four periods fig 2 including period 1 from 1954 to 1963 the pre impact period with negligible human intervention period 2 from 1964 to 1975 corresponding to scenario 1 a total of five dss were built on the mainstream and some dss which produced secondary impacts on mainstream streamflow were built in the tributaries period 3 from 1976 to 1996 corresponding to scenario 2 a total of seven dss were built on the mainstream and some dss were newly built in the tributaries and period 4 from 1997 to 2013 corresponding to scenario 3 a total of seven dss were built on the mainstream none of which were newly built however some dss were newly built in the tributaries in addition to the construction times of the dss the length of time series required by the iha and the indicators of ecosurplus and ecodeficit at least 15 years based on previous studies is another important reason for selecting split points in the division of post impact periods kennard et al 2010 fantin cruz et al 2015 as shown in fig 1 the zhaopingtai and yingshang sluices were built in 1959 and 1962 upstream and downstream of the srb respectively although they inevitably had an impact on streamflow during the period 1954 1963 the period was selected as the pre impact period because 1 1954 was the first year for which we could obtain a complete data record in the study area the application of iha and range of variability approach rva methods require a long time series of streamflow observations at least 15 years based on previous studies kennard et al 2010 fantin cruz et al 2015 2 the zhaopingtai reservoir and yingshang sluice are far away from the zhoukou and fuyang stations fig 1 therefore we assume that their regulatory effects on the alteration in hr ef at the zhoukou and fuyang stations can be ignored the year 1975 was selected as a time point to separate the assessment period because both the zhoukou and huaidian sluices were built this year which is very important for assessing the change in impact as the number of dss increases the year 1996 was selected as another time point to double check whether the alteration of the hr ef was affected by the dss during different periods with new ds constructions second we obtained the flow series affected by climate variability and land use change in the post impact sub periods step 2 in fig 2 to this end a hydrological model is needed for each period the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods in this study to simulate the streamflow affected by climate variability and land use change in each post impact sub period discussed in the next paragraph streamflow simulated by the model with the input of climate and land use datasets in the pre impact period pre land use driven model is considered to be only affected by climate variability factors streamflow simulated by models with inputs of climate dataset in the pre impact period and land use dataset in each post impact sub period post land use driven model is considered to be affected by both climate and land use change factors the difference in streamflow simulated by the pre land use driven model and each post land use driven model was used to represent the impact of land use change on streamflow in the post impact sub period in this study two distributed hydrological models were constructed using swat to obtain the flow series discussed in the previous paragraph they are driven by the same climate datasets in the pre impact period and different land use datasets in 2000 and 2010 respectively we used land use datasets from 2000 to 2010 because of the limited data available in the basin the year 2000 was the first land use dataset that could be obtained in the basin we assumed that land use in 2000 was not affected by human activities and applied it to hydrological modeling in the pre impact period therefore the first model model one was prepared based on the land use dataset in 2000 and was calibrated and validated based on the observed streamflow in the pre impact period from 1954 to 1963 with negligible human impact the first two years from 1954 to 1955 were used to warm up the model and the periods 1956 1960 and 1961 1963 were used to calibrate and validate the model respectively as the effects of human activities on streamflow were ignored during 1954 1963 the streamflow simulated by model one from 1964 to 2013 was assumed to be only affected by climate variability factors the second model model two was built based on the land use dataset of 2010 it had the same meteorological data input and was assigned the same model parameter values as model one the difference in streamflow simulated by the two models can be used to represent the impact of land use change on streamflow because the two models were built in the period without ds influence and land use data input was the only difference between them third we obtain the flow series forced by the dss in the post impact sub periods step 3 in fig 2 based on the flow series affected by climate variability and land use change the flow series affected by dss in the i th post impact sub period denoted as qds i can be approximately estimated by a simple mathematical operation between streamflow observations affected by dss climate variability and land use change denoted as qo i streamflow affected by climate variability denoted as qc i and streamflow affected by land use change denoted as δql i q ds i q o i δ q l i q c i see section 2 6 finally we compared the alterations in hr ef due to dss in different post impact sub periods step 4 in fig 2 we calculated the iha as well as the ecohydrological indicators of ecosurplus and ecodeficit in each post impact sub period subsequently their comparison in different post impact sub periods was carried out to achieve our research purposes with respect to the iha hydrologic alteration factors haf in the low middle and high categories of hydrologic variability range and hydrologic alteration degree had were calculated using the rva in different post impact sub periods see methods in section 2 4 by comparing the changes in iha haf and had in different post impact sub periods at annual and seasonal scales the effects of the increasing number of dss on the hydrological regime can be revealed with respect to ecohydrological indicators ecosurplus and ecodeficit were calculated based on flow duration curves fdc in each post impact sub period with the pre impact period as a reference by comparing the ecosurplus and ecodeficit in different post impact sub periods the effects of the increasing number of dss on ef can also be revealed see section 2 5 2 3 swat model the swat model is a physically based semi distributed hydrological model that has been widely used to reveal instream hydrological variations neitsch et al 2011 pang et al 2020 devia et al 2015 el nasr et al 2005 li et al 2010 gassman et al 2014 the simulation of runoff in the swat model is divided into two stages a land stage that controls the amount of water sediment nutrients and pesticide loadings to the main channel in each sub basin and a routing stage that controls the movement of water sediments nutrients and pesticide loadings to the basin outlet by routing in the channel network shivhare et al 2018 gao et al 2018 luo and shao 2022 the water balance equation of the model is as follows neitsch et al 2011 igder et al 2022 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw where s w t and s w 0 are the final and initial soil water content respectively t is the time and r day q surf e a ω seep and q gw are the amount of precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration percolation and return flow on day i respectively the key steps of the modeling processes in the swat model include watershed delineation based on dem hydrologic response unit hru analysis based on land use soil and slope data and weather data preparation abbaspour et al 2015 dos santos et al 2022 shivhare et al 2018 tuo et al 2016 in this study 48 sub basins were divided based on the threshold of the upstream drainage area the smaller the specified upstream drainage area threshold the more the sub basins will be divided and the modeling process will be more complex and time consuming swain et al 2022 according to the land use soil and slope data in the srb 325 hrus were obtained each sub basin includes multiple hrus each hru corresponded to a unique combination of land use soil and slope classes hydrological analysis of swat was first performed in each hru the generated runoff then converges to the outlets of the sub basins and eventually to the outlet of the study area based on empirical and physical formulas describing the complex runoff generation and confluence processes arnold et al 2012 lee et al 2022 luo and shao 2022 the specific modeling processes of swat are detailed in the swat user s guide winchell et al 2013 the performance of the swat model was quantified statistically using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pb and coefficient of determination r2 ma et al 2019 both the indicators of nse and r2 vary between 0 and 1 the greater these values the better the simulation results in general for nse 0 65 r 2 0 7 and pb 25 the simulation is considered representative 2 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 pb i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i 100 4 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where n is the number of observed monthly flow rate data oi and si are the observed and simulated flow rates at time i respectively and o and s are the averages of the observed and simulated flow rates respectively 2 4 flow regime indicators and assessment methods 2 4 1 indicators of hydrological alterations the iha proposed by richter et al 1996 have been widely used to reveal the effects of human activities dam and sluice regulation water diversions and groundwater pumping on hr based on streamflow in pre and post impact periods it includes 33 statistical parameters divided into five categories magnitude duration timing frequency and rate of change table 3 these indicators were calculated using daily flow data we used the iha software version 7 1 0 10 the nature conservancy 2009 for the calculations 2 4 2 range of variability approach the rva based on iha was used to quantify the change in streamflow affected by human activities the iha in the pre impact period were used as references to obtain the initial environmental flow goals and assess the alteration in the hr induced by human activities the nature conservancy 2009 for each iha three hafs in the low 0 24 middle 25 75 and high 76 100 categories were calculated based on the actual and expected frequency of the post impact iha values falling within corresponding categories in the pre impact period the specific steps for calculating hafs are summarized as follows first non parametric statistics percentile were used to divide the pre impact period into three different categories with 25 and 75 as the percentile thresholds as the pre impact period was used as the reference for defining the extent to which natural flow regimes have been altered this yields three categories the lowest category contains all values less than or equal to the 25th percentile the middle category contains all values falling in the 25th to 75th percentiles and the highest category contains all values greater than the 75th percentile second we calculate the expected frequency with which the post impact values of the iha should fall within each category see the calculation method of n e in eq 5 with the middle category as an example third we compute the frequency with which the post impact annual values of the iha fell within each of the three categories see the explanation of n i in eq 6 with the middle category as an example finally a haf value can be calculated for each of the three categories based on n i and n e using the simple mathematical method in eq 6 see the calculation of d i in eq 6 with the middle category as an example details of the calculation of hafs are provided in the user s manual of the iha the nature conservancy 2009 according to zhang et al 2015 the haf in the middle category of each iha is defined as the had of the indicator for quantifying the alteration in the hr affected by the regulation of dss the calculation of had for each iha is shown in eqs 5 and 6 the integrated had was calculated using eq 7 5 n e r n t 6 d i n i n e n e 100 7 d 0 1 n i 1 33 d i 2 where d i is the hydrological alteration factor for each iha n i is the number of years of the post impact i t h iha that falls within the rva goal range from 25 to 75 mentioned above based on the pre impact period n e is the number of expected years of the i t h iha that falls within the rva goal range r is the ratio of the number of years of the pre impact i t h iha that falls within the rva goal range to total years 50 is recommended in many other studies zhang et al 2015 n t is the total number of years in the post impact period 2 5 ecosurplus and ecodeficit indicators ecosurplus and ecodeficit proposed by vogel et al 2007 based on fdcs which reflect the relationship between the daily ordered streamflow observations q i and their exceeding probability p i i n 1 where n is the number of days and i is the rank are important nondimensional metrics for river ef assessment regarding the quantification of these two indices the fdc in the reference period the pre impact period from 1954 to 1963 was plotted first and then the fdcs in different post impact sub periods were plotted in the same graph as the fdc in the reference period the area below the pre impact fdc curve and above the post impact fdc curve shows the amount of water that cannot be used to meet instream flow requirements currently owing to the regulation of dss and the ratio of this area to the total area of the pre impact fdc curve was defined as ecodeficit see gao et al 2009 for detail similarly ecosurplus is the ratio of the area below the post impact fdc curve and above the pre impact fdc curve to the total area of the pre impact fdc curve we calculated ecosurplus and ecodeficit at temporal scales of the season spring from march to may summer from june to august autumn from september to november winter from december to february and year based on annual and seasonal fdcs to analyze the annual and seasonal effects of multiple dss on ef 2 6 contributions of dss to flow changes the streamflow alteration induced by the regulation of dss should be separated from climate variability and land use change before studying the contribution of dss to streamflow alteration in ds dominated basins because dss and land use are two different types of human activities affecting changes in streamflow the mathematical method for separating the impact of dss on streamflow from climate variability and land use change was simply represented as follows the total change in streamflow in the i t h post impact sub period scenarios 1 3 caused by climate variability and human activities δ q t i was calculated based on the observed mean annual streamflow q o i in the i t h post impact sub period and the observed mean annual streamflow in the pre impact period q ou δ q t i q o i q ou δ q c i δ q h i where δ q c i and δ q h i indicate the change in mean annual streamflow affected by climate variability and human activities in the i t h period respectively yang et al 2020b the alteration in streamflow caused by climate variability in the i t h post impact sub period δ q c i was calculated based on the mean annual streamflow in the pre impact period q ou and the simulated mean annual streamflow in the i t h post impact sub period q s 1 i using model one section 2 2 and δ q c i q s 1 i q ou dey and mishra 2017 the alteration in streamflow caused by human activity in the i t h post impact sub period δ q h i was calculated based on δ q t i and δ q c i δ q h i δ q t i δ q c i dey and mishra 2017 the alteration of streamflow caused by land use change δ q l i was calculated using the difference in mean annual streamflow simulated by the model q s 1 i and the model two q s 2 i since land use is the only difference between them in terms of data input and model parameters δ q l i q s 2 i q s 1 i therefore the dss that caused alterations in streamflow in the i t h post impact sub period δ q ds i can be calculated as δ q ds i δ q h i δ q l i δ q t i δ q c i δ q l i the degree of contribution of dss climate variability and land use change to alterations in streamflow can be calculated as 8 c ds i δ q ds i δ q ds i δ q c i δ q oth i 100 9 c l i δ q l i δ q ds i δ q c i δ q l i 100 10 c c i δ q c i δ q ds i δ q c i δ q l i 100 where c ds i c c i and c l i indicate the degree of contribution of dss climate variability and land use change to changes in streamflow in the i t h period respectively 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation the measured streamflow at zhoukou and fuyang stations located midstream and downstream of the srb as well as three typical metrics r2 pb and nse were used to evaluate the performance of the swat model constructed in this study swat cup software was used to calibrate the hydrological models after four iterations each iteration included 500 simulations for adjusting model parameters the r2 pb and nse values reached 0 73 3 36 and 0 71 at the zhoukou station and 0 79 1 40 and 0 75 at the fuyang station in the calibration period the r2 pb and nse values were 0 81 15 85 and 0 78 at the zhoukou station and 0 77 18 79 and 0 70 at the fuyang station in the validation period showing a goodness of fit between model simulation values and observations we attempted more iterations however the model performance did not improve further according to previous studies and swat cup documentation four iterations including 500 simulations are sufficient to reach an acceptable solution tejaswini and sathian 2018 therefore the accuracy of the constructed model was satisfactory fig 3 a b 3 2 comparison in streamflow affected by climate variability and dss to quantify the impact of dss on streamflow as the number of dss increases we built two distributed hydrologic models models one and two mentioned in section 2 2 to derive the streamflow affected by land use change denoted by δ q l i and quantified by the difference in streamflow simulated by the two models section 2 6 for details therefore the streamflow affected by both climate variability and dss in the i t h post impact sub period q c c d s i can be derived using the difference between the measured streamflow q o i and δ q l i q c c d s i q o i δ q l i we then compared the change in streamflow simulated by model one representing the impact of climate variability q c i and q c c d s i in our designed three post impact sub periods the results are plotted in fig 3c d table 4 shows the monthly average streamflow of q c and q c c d s denoted as q c and q c c d s respectively under different scenarios at the zhoukou and fuyang stations according to the table the simulated monthly average streamflow by model one in the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods as scenarios 1 to 3 were 130 12 117 55 101 55 and 123 62 m3 s respectively at the zhoukou station q c in table 4 the monthly average streamflow affected by both climate variability and dss q c c d s in table 4 were 130 38 m3 s in the pre impact period 115 46 m3 s in scenario 1 79 98 m3 s in scenario 2 and 89 39 m3 s in scenario 3 respectively therefore the difference in streamflow affected by climate variability only and by both climate variability and dss in the pre impact period was very small with a value of 0 26 m3 s this shows that the alteration in streamflow caused by human activities is negligible during the pre impact period at the zhoukou station however the differences in monthly average streamflow simulated by model one q c and q c c d s representing the streamflow affected by dss showed an increasing trend from scenarios 1 to 3 with values of 2 09 m3 s 21 57 m3 s and 34 23 m3 s showing that streamflow was decreased as the number of dss increased the simulated monthly average streamflow by model one in the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods for scenarios 1 to 3 were 185 19 171 41 161 13 and 189 88 m3 s respectively at the fuyang station where the corresponding monthly average streamflow values of q c c d s were 191 82 163 41 111 22 and 125 29 m3 s respectively table 4 the differences in monthly average streamflow simulated by model one and q c c d s at the fuyang station were 8 00 49 91 and 64 59 m3 s from scenarios 1 to 3 table 4 therefore the results of streamflow at the fuyang station showed a similar decrease in variation as that of the zhoukou station as the number of dss increased however the difference between q c and q c c d s in the pre impact period with a value of 6 63 m3 s was close to that in scenario 1 with a value of 8 00 m3 s at the fuyang station table 4 indicating that the impact of human activities on streamflow was not significantly different between the two periods in addition the difference between q c and q c c d s in the pre impact period at the fuyang station is greater than that at the zhoukou station with a value of 0 26 m3 s therefore streamflow in the pre impact period at the fuyang station is more seriously affected by human activities than that at the zhoukou station because the streamflow of the pre impact period was used as the benchmark natural streamflow to assess alterations in hr ef induced by dss in this study the results of this study will be limited by the selection of the pre impact period at the fuyang station 3 3 alteration in the iha in different periods affected by dss the iha were calculated based on streamflow affected by climate variability in the pre impact period and by both climate variability and dss in three post impact sub periods in the srb to derive hafs affected by dss fig 4 a f shows the monthly mean streamflow in the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods at the zhoukou and fuyang stations it can be seen that monthly mean streamflow in the high flow months may september in the post impact sub periods was significantly reduced compared with that in the pre impact period the average of streamflow in fig 4 from may to september in the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods is 233 69 173 32 130 91 and 138 10 m3 s respectively at the zhoukou station and 359 28 258 77 175 46 and 198 49 m3 s respectively at the fuyang station this shows that the dss have a significant regulating effect on high flow by comparing the streamflow in the three post impact sub periods it can be seen that the monthly mean streamflow reduction in both scenarios 2 and 3 with values of 130 91 and 138 10 m3 s at the zhoukou station and 175 46 and 198 49 m3 s at the fuyang station was greater than that in scenario 1 with values of 173 32 and 258 77 m3 s at the zhoukou and fuyang stations respectively in the high flow months related to the pre impact period it can be concluded that with an increase in the number of dss the reduction effect of dss on streamflow in the high flow months is strengthened focusing on the spatial scale the difference in the monthly mean streamflow between the post impact sub periods and their corresponding pre impact periods in the high flow months was greater at the fuyang station with values of 100 51 183 82 and 160 79 m3 s than that at the zhoukou station with values of 60 37 102 78 and 95 59 m3 s respectively fig 5 a f shows the results of the analysis of variance anova at the zhoukou and fuyang stations anova was used to measure the dispersion of the iha caused by the regulation effects of dss the coefficient of variance cv is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean where and are the standard deviation and the mean of the time series respectively the higher the cv the greater the level of dispersion around the mean stigler 1986 according to fig 5a b the cv values of streamflow in the post impact sub periods from scenarios 1 to 3 were greater than that in the pre impact period in most high and low flow months this was more obvious in the low flow months at the zhoukou station where all the cv values in the post impact sub periods were greater than that in the pre impact period fig 5a however the differences in cv between the post impact and pre impact periods in the low flow months were greater than that in the high flow months at both the zhoukou and fuyang stations fig 5a b indicating that the regulation effect of dss on low flow is greater than that on high flow in the srb the regulation of dss made the dispersion of high flow smaller which tends to reduce from scenarios 1 to 3 as the number of dss increases that is with the increase in the number of dss the changes in streamflow become more regular as discussed in another work that showed that the regulation of dss makes the flow curve smooth the discharge flow concentrated and the peak flow reduced and has a great impact over river hydrological conditions luo et al 2020 according to fig 5 c f not all the iha changed greatly with the increase in the number of dss for some indicators like the 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day 90 day maximum and date of maximum fig 5c d the difference in cv between the pre impact and post impact periods is small this may be related to the degree of rivers regulated by dss because highly artificially regulated rivers make the changes of flow more regular as discussed above fig 6 a f shows hafs calculated based on the iha in the low middle and high rva categories according to fig 6a f the iha in the low and high rva categories changed greatly compared with that in the middle rva category at both the zhoukou fig 6a c and e and fuyang fig 6b d and f stations indicating that integrated regulation of multiple dss had a high impact on extreme flows high and low flows in detail most iha in the low rva category changed positively 23 29 and 29 iha changed positively in scenarios 1 3 at the zhoukou station respectively accounting for 70 88 and 88 of the total metrics 15 26 and 26 iha changed positively in scenarios 1 3 at the fuyang station respectively accounting for 45 79 and 79 of the total metrics while most iha in the high rva category changed negatively 16 25 and 21 iha changed negatively in scenarios 1 3 at the zhoukou station respectively accounting for 48 76 and 64 of the total metrics 18 23 and 22 iha changed negatively in scenarios 1 3 at the fuyang station respectively accounting for 55 70 and 67 of the total metrics by comparing the changes of the iha metrics in low and high rva categories we found that 1 regulation of dss increases the frequency of low flow and decreases the frequency of high flow and the alteration of low flow caused by dss is greater than that of high flow in the srb more iha metrics are positively altered in the low rva category than that negatively altered in the high rva category 2 the proportion of positive iha to total iha in the low rva category is not changed greatly from scenarios 2 to 3 at the zhoukou and fuyang stations 3 the proportion of negative iha to total iha in the high rva category is decreased slightly from scenarios 2 to 3 at the zhoukou and fuyang stations the alteration of the iha at the zhoukou station in different scenarios showed that scenario 2 with average absolute haf values of 1 52 0 33 and 0 92 in the low middle and high rva categories was greater than that in scenario 3 with corresponding values of 1 12 0 23 0 99 and the latter values were greater than those in scenario 1 with corresponding values of 0 711 0 221 and 0 711 at the zhoukou station fig 6a c and d the greater hr alteration in scenario 3 compared to that in scenario 1 indicates that increased ds construction contributes to the alteration of the hr the alteration of the iha at the fuyang station showed that scenario 3 with average absolute haf values of 1 14 0 44 and 1 18 in the low middle and high rva categories was greater than that in scenario 2 with corresponding values of 0 83 0 30 and 0 92 and the latter values were greater than those in scenario 1 with corresponding values of 0 70 0 30 and 0 66 fig 6b d and f the alteration of streamflow in the order of scenario 3 scenario 2 scenario 1 at the fuyang station verified our conclusion at the zhoukou station that more ds construction contributes to the alteration of the hr for each iha in fig 6a f the frequencies of the 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day minimum increased in the low rva category moreover the increase was largest in scenario 2 followed by scenarios 3 and 1 at the zhoukou station a similar change in the frequencies of these iha occurred in the low rva category at the fuyang station however the order of the increase was scenario 3 scenario 2 scenario 1 the frequencies of these indicators in the middle and high rva categories decreased in the post impact sub periods compared with those in the pre impact period except for scenario 2 at the fuyang station this further verified that the regulation of the dss increased the frequency of low flow the frequencies of the indicators of the 1 day 3 day 7 day 30 day and 90 day maximum increased in the low and middle rva categories while their frequencies decreased in the high rva categories in the post impact sub periods compared with those in the pre impact period this showed that the regulation of the dss decreased the frequency of high flow table 5 presents the results for the integrated had it can be seen that the integrated monthly average had of 42 27 at the zhoukou station in scenario 2 was greater than that in scenarios 1 and 3 with values of 26 79 and 29 61 respectively however the integrated monthly average had at the fuyang station showed that scenario 3 with a value of 53 50 was greater than that in scenarios 1 and 2 with values of 37 51 and 38 12 respectively the integrated alteration degree at the fuyang station was greater than that at the zhoukou station except in scenario 2 in which the zhoukou sluice was newly built in the period and produced a direct impact on streamflow 3 4 ecosurplus and ecodeficit changes affected by dss the annual and seasonal ecosurpluses and ecodeficits are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively it can be seen that the ecodeficit was greater than the ecosurplus in the three post impact sub periods from scenarios 1 to 3 at both the zhoukou and fuyang stations these results indicate that the construction of the dss reduced the ef in the basin the ecodeficit increased from scenario 1 with values of 39 85 and 15 94 at the zhoukou and fuyang stations to scenario 2 with values of 58 34 and 42 21 and scenario 3 with values of 53 42 and 34 84 on the annual scale this indicates that the increasing number of dss from scenarios 1 to 3 had a negative impact on ef the seasonal variation of the ecosurplus and ecodeficit in fig 8 shows that the ecodeficit mainly occurred in summer and winter in the three ds scenarios at the zhoukou and fuyang stations it was also serious in spring except in scenario 1 with values of 4 69 and 1 98 at the zhoukou and fuyang stations respectively however the ecodeficit in autumn was not as serious as that in spring summer and winter at both the zhoukou and fuyang stations this indicates that the regulation of dss had a great influence on ef in spring summer and winter while the influence in autumn was relatively small therefore the seasonal ecodeficit in scenario 2 was the largest followed by scenario 3 and it was the smallest in scenario 1 at the zhoukou and fuyang stations the larger ecodeficit in scenarios 2 and 3 compared with scenario 1 concluded that the construction of dss contributed to the decline in ef as the number of dss increases their impact on the ef increases 3 5 contribution of dss to streamflow variation the contributions of climate variability dss and land use change to the alteration in streamflow in table 6 show that the contribution of dss increased from scenarios 1 to 3 with values of 37 32 45 51 and 73 13 at the zhoukou station and 51 06 66 52 and 89 59 at the fuyang station respectively in scenario 1 the contribution of dss to alterations in streamflow was low but still greater than the contributions of climate variability and land use change however the contribution of the dss to the alteration in streamflow increased significantly in scenarios 2 and 3 it can be seen that dss played a dominant role in the alteration of streamflow because their contribution degrees were near or greater than 50 this showed that human activities related to the regulation of dss in the srb were important factors affecting alterations in streamflow table 6 shows that the contribution of dss to the alteration in streamflow at the fuyang station located downstream of the srb was greater than that at the zhoukou station located midstream of the basin indicating a greater impact of dss on streamflow downstream than midstream 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of dss on hr ef streamflow between upstream and downstream river sections is closely linked to natural rivers without human intervention therefore river flow affected by upstream dams and other impoundments influences downstream flow rates magnitudes and frequencies of occurrence jiang et al 2019 yaghmaei et al 2018 in our study the alteration of the iha at the zhoukou station showed that the impacts of dss on hr ef in scenario 2 from 1976 to 1996 was greater than that in scenarios 1 and 3 the ecodeficit at the zhoukou station also showed similar characteristics according to the results in section 3 4 the streamflow at the zhoukou station was affected by the four dss in scenario 2 table 2 one of them was newly built in the beginning year of the period zhoukou sluice built in 1975 and the remaining three were built before the period of consideration zhaopingtai in 1959 baiguishan in 1966 and mawan in 1966 see fig 1 in scenario 1 three dss affected the streamflow at the zhoukou station similar to scenario 2 there are also four dss affecting streamflow in scenario 3 at the zhoukou station no new dss were built on the mainstream of the basin in scenario 3 the largest flow regime alteration in scenario 2 may have been caused by the newly constructed zhoukou sluice which had a direct impact on streamflow however a series of anthropogenic regulations and environmental protection measures such as environmental laws and regulations likely mitigated the effects of the flow regime and ecodeficit induced by the dss in scenario 3 compared with those in scenario 2 the huai river basin the shaying river is the largest tributary of the huai river was the first in china to have a comprehensive water pollution control program bai and shi 2006 zhai et al 2014 initiated and led by the central government in 1994 the huai river pollution control plan was the largest single river basin pollution abatement campaign in china with a 10 year total investment estimate of more than 60 billion chinese renminbi yuan cny or approximately us 8 billion bai and shi 2006 in june 1994 the state environmental protection bureau the ministry of water resources and the four provinces along the river jointly promulgated the decision on preventing pollution emergencies of water courses in the huai river basin trial zhong 2006 in august 1995 the state council enacted china s first basin wide water pollution control laws and regulations interim regulations on the prevention and control of water pollution in the huai river basin xia et al 2011 the implementation of a series of ecological protection measures mitigated the impact of dss on the flow regime and ecodeficit in the basin to further compare the ecodeficits in different scenarios we plotted the temporal variation of average daily streamflow and the corresponding frequency of occurrence from 1956 to 2013 a total of 58 years in the zhoukou station fig 9 we used 75 as the threshold of frequency of occurrence corresponding to the average daily streamflow of 49 m3 s to select low flow years in each scenario 75 was determined subjectively based on research data for analysis purposes the results showed that 14 of the 58 years 1956 2013 had an average daily flow of less than 49 m3 s among them eight years occurred in scenario 2 1976 1996 and four years occurred in scenario 3 1997 2013 according to fig 9 the streamflow in the years 1986 1988 and 1992 1995 in scenario 2 is smaller than that in other years therefore the low flow years in scenario 2 relative to those in scenarios 1 and 3 are an important reason for the severe ecodeficit in scenario 2 our findings also showed that the regulation of dss altered the iha in the low below 25 of daily flows in the pre impact period and high above 75 of daily flows in the pre impact period rva categories compared to the middle rva category fig 6 this indicates that the dss had a high impact on extreme low and high flows for the former the frequency of occurrence of low flow increased and the fluctuation of low flow changes was more obvious than that in the pre impact period for the latter the frequency of the occurrence of high flow decreased in our study this reflects the reduction effect of ds regulation on flood peaks and their regulation of low flow these results are consistent with the regulation rules for dss this is the pre release and re storage process of reservoirs when a flood occurs which contributes to the reduction of peak flow dang et al 2022 peng et al 2022 multiple dss make flood regulation more significant owing to their cascading effects our results at the fuyang station showed that the impact of dss on the monthly average streamflow alteration in scenario 1 was not significantly different from that in the pre impact period specifically the monthly average streamflow alteration in scenario 1 was slightly greater than that in the pre impact period this result is based on a comparison of the monthly average streamflow the average streamflow from january to december between the two periods a further comparison of changes in monthly streamflow fig 4b showed that monthly streamflow changed differently between the two periods at the fuyang station showing an increasing low flow and a decreasing high flow from the pre impact period to scenario 1 this shows that the dss in scenario 1 mainly play the role of regulating extreme flows as discussed above the increased low flow and decreased high flow were the main reasons for the small difference in the monthly average streamflow between the two periods another possible reason is the impact of the dss on the tributaries of the shaying river some dss were constructed during the pre impact period table 1 such as the loudi sluice constructed on the fenquan river in 1960 this means that streamflow in the pre impact period is also affected by the dss at the fuyang station in addition the variation in monthly streamflow at fuyang station revealed that streamflow variation in scenario 3 was almost the same as that in scenario 2 and both affected by six dss were greater than those in scenario 1 affected by four dss similar variation characteristics of the iha in scenarios 2 and 3 were greater than those in scenario 1 at the zhoukou station indicating that the integrated regulation of multiple dss has a significant impact on streamflow and the effect increases as the number of dss increases the contribution of dss to hydrological alteration table 6 shows that the contribution of dss in scenarios 2 and 3 is greater than that in scenario 1 supporting the conclusion that the integrated regulation of dss in the srb has a great impact on streamflow as more dss are constructed during scenarios 2 and 3 than in scenario 1 4 2 limitations and application prospects of the proposed framework this section focuses on the limitations uncertainty of sources of the proposed framework owing to data availability and hydrological modeling and our suggestions for reducing uncertainties caused by these limitations when using it in other basins the limitations and corresponding suggestions are summarized as follows the first limitation is the availability of land use datasets according to the framework proposed in section 2 2 land use datasets in different study periods the pre impact period and three post impact sub periods are required to simulate flow series affected by climate variability and land use change respectively however obtaining land use datasets in the pre impact periods the construction of dss usually dates to the 1970 s in many basins is often difficult in many global basins because satellite remote sensing which is one of the main means of obtaining land use datasets matured in the 1970 s mcroberts et al 2010 therefore we chose a land use dataset later than the pre impact period as an alternative such as 2000 in this study this inevitably results in uncertainty to reduce the impact of land use data one land use dataset should be prepared for each study period for hydrological modeling as described in section 2 2 if land use data are available land use datasets from periods earlier than the 1970 s can be obtained through land use prediction models such as the patch generating land use simulation plus model and the markov chain cellular automata method halmy et al 2015 liang et al 2021 however these models themselves typically have uncertainties studying the impact of applying predicted land use data on the performance of the proposed method is a valuable research effort that needs to be further explored the second limitation was the design of the study on the one hand different numbers of years of hydrological records for each post impact sub period will affect the results of the iha directly such as mean flow in each month table 3 because the values of the iha change with the length of the data records in the post impact sub periods on the other hand the length of the hydrological records in the pre and post impact study periods insufficient length of time series often limits the application of iha and rva methods in most global basins as they require at least 15 years of pre and post impact streamflow data according to previous studies kennard et al 2010 fantin cruz et al 2015 for example richter et al 1997 recommended a data length greater than 20 years some studies have attempted to overcome the problem of data length by reconstructing the natural regime to extend the pre impact period but the post impact period cannot be easily extended because it is affected by both climate and human activities and is selected based on multiple factors such as the number and construction times of dss wang et al 2017 lu et al 2018 han et al 2019 timpe and kaplan 2017 characterized the uncertainty associated with the application of shorter record lengths when data are limited they found that a shorter record length is sufficient in several cases such as high flow and lowland rivers timpe and kaplan 2017 in this study we designed four study periods based on the number and construction times of dss the designed periods differ in the number of data records 10 years for the pre impact period and 12 21 and 17 years for the three post impact sub periods respectively due to limited streamflow observations in the study area this is one of the limitations affecting the results of this study therefore a data length greater than 15 years is required for each study period if the streamflow observations are sufficient additionally the length of the data records for each post impact period should be as equal as possible when designing the study period third climate and flow regimes in the pre impact period directly influence the conclusions of this study as the flow regime in the pre impact period was used as the reference to assess ds induced alteration in hr ef in the iha and rva methods in addition the hydrological models used in this study for simulating natural streamflow in post impact sub periods use climate datasets from the pre impact period as input therefore natural climatic variability and flow regimes are required during the pre impact period in other words the climate and flow regime in the pre impact period should not be affected by human activities relative to the post impact periods we usually choose pre dam sluice years with natural regime flows as the pre impact period the period before ds construction if the data length of the observed flow series is sufficient however in many cases the length of the observed flow data before ds construction is insufficient or incomplete for example the pre impact period designed in this study 1954 1963 includes two dss the zhaopingtai reservoir built in 1959 and the yingshang sluice built in 1962 although the results in section 3 2 showed that ds induced alterations in streamflow are small in the period at the zhoukou and fuyang stations they inevitably have an impact on the results of this research for example the difference in streamflow affected by climate variability only and by both climate variability and dss is 0 26 and 6 63 m3 s respectively they accounted for 0 2 and 4 3 of the monthly average streamflow in the period respectively therefore the selection of the pre impact period should fully consider the natural climate variability and flow regime relative to the post impact period as well as the length and completeness of the observed flow time series finally the streamflow simulated using the swat model was combined with observations to remove the impacts of climate variability and land use change to assess ds induced alterations in hr ef which inevitably brings about a certain amount of uncertainty caused by incorrect streamflow simulation simulated streamflow is needed because the observed streamflow in hydrological stations is comprehensively affected by multiple factors such as climate variability dss and land use change zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2013 hecht et al 2019 it is difficult to remove the effects of climate variability and land use change when assessing ds induced ef alterations based only on observations therefore hydrological models were employed in this study to simulate streamflow affected by climate variation and land use change see section 2 2 however the simulation error of streamflow due to factors such as land use and meteorological data input data accuracy spatial and temporal resolution integrity and spatial coverage and the calibration of model parameters will inevitably affect the results of hr ef assessment induced by dss in particular the calibration and validation periods of the hydrological model were relatively short five years were used to calibrate the models and three years were used to validate the models in this study because of the short data records in the pre impact period note that the simulation error of streamflow propagates step by step in the proposed method this will first affect the calculation accuracy of streamflow affected by climate variability and land use change which will be further applied to calculate streamflow affected by dss based on streamflow observations errors propagate during these processes the streamflow affected by dss will eventually be applied to assess the hr ef alterations induced by dss based on the iha and eco flow metrics errors propagate further in these processes to reduce the impact of error propagation we should focus on reducing the error sources caused during streamflow simulation by providing high quality meteorological and land use data as inputs for hydrological modeling for example remote sensing datasets with global coverage and high spatiotemporal resolution have been shown to improve the accuracy of streamflow simulations in the absence of meteorological data naseem et al 2016 ding and zhu 2022 luo et al 2022 using more observation sites to calibrate and validate hydrological models is also an effective approach for reducing errors in hydrological simulations 5 conclusions the primary objective of this study was to provide a framework for studying the impact of multiple dss as their number increases on the alteration in hr ef in dam dominated basins by separating disturbances from climate variability and land use change as a demonstration the framework was applied to an srb the hydrological models swat iha and indicators of ecosurplus and ecodeficit were employed to compare the alterations in hr ef induced by different numbers of dss the results showed that the integrated regulation of multiple dss affects the hr ef and the impact increases as the number of dss increases in particular the low and high flows were more seriously affected by the dss than the middle flow low middle and high flows are defined based on the 25th and 75th percentile thresholds of streamflow in the pre impact period see section 2 4 2 owing to the impact of the dss the frequency of occurrence of low flow increased and the frequency of occurrence of high flow decreased this reflects the reduction effect of dss regulation on flood peaks and their regulation of low flow nonetheless there is still a lack of systematic research and summary on how multiple dss affect hr ef alterations low middle and high flows in different spatial locations upstream midstream and downstream of basins this is a valuable research topic worth exploring because dss have different effects on hr ef at different spatial locations in basins the variation characteristics and differences in low middle and high flow in post impact periods relative to those in the pre impact period due to the construction of dss in ds dominated basins are also a valuable research topic the proposed framework can provide a reference for future research on these problems the proposed framework is effective but also limited by factors such as data availability and the division of study periods it is worth mentioning that the land use changes in this study were only taken from 2000 to 2010 because of the limited data available according to the framework proposed in section 2 2 more land use datasets should be considered therefore the conclusions obtained in this study may be partially biased by insufficient land use data and other factors stated in section 4 2 such as the selection of the pre impact period the application of the proposed framework to other basins should focus on the errors caused by these factors overall this study revealed the impact of different numbers of multiple dss on the hr ef at annual and seasonal scales the proposed framework can serve as a reference for separating the effects of dss climate variability and land use change on the hr ef in other ds dominated basins to improve the knowledge of the basin scale hydrological status it also helps to understand the relationship between the spatial distribution of the dss and their impacts on the flow regime credit authorship contribution statement zengliang luo conceptualization methodology software formal analysis data curation writing

2511,estuarine rivers provide critical pathways for seawater to travel upstream of the coast and salinize adjacent aquifers however this salinization mechanism forthwith termed riparian saltwater intrusion has received relatively little attention compared to saltwater intrusion si at the coast time series measurements of river and groundwater freshwater head and specific conductance sc as well as horizontal river aquifer hydraulic gradient were collected at transects of piezometers perpendicular to an estuarine river in ōtautahi christchurch aotearoa new zealand the uncertainties of freshwater head and hydraulic gradient were estimated using error propagation methods discrete fourier transforms were applied to river and groundwater freshwater head and sc time series data which confirmed the tidal influence in both systems cross correlation analyses of river and groundwater freshwater heads showed very strong relationships with varying time lags hydraulic gradients and river sc fluctuated with tides resulting in the alternation of si increase in groundwater sc and saltwater retreat decrease in groundwater sc with various time delays that may be driven by cyclic flow processes while riparian si occurred in most piezometers the hydraulic gradient on the outside of the river meander was steeper than on the inside of the river meander resulting in less si although positive hydraulic gradient aquifer to river flow direction occurred most of the time at all sites land subsidence and climate change conditions of sea level rise increased drought and decreased river

hypoaigic zone trefry et al 2007 subterranean estuaries moore 1999 areas of saltwater infiltration vandenbohede et al 2008 or simply as zones of groundwater and surface water interaction westbrook et al 2005 creating difficulties in discovering literature specific to riparian si this paper uses the term riparian si to describe the displacement of fresh groundwater by brackish or saline water from estuarine rivers or streams the interaction between fresh groundwater and an estuarine river with fluctuating salinity and head generates complex mixing processes trefry et al 2007 westbrook et al 2005 density contrasts between fresh groundwater and brackish to saline river water create a saltwater wedge where a mixed convection cell occurs here river water flows into the adjacent aquifer mixes with existing groundwater and the mixed water can then be recirculated back into the river fig 1 linderfelt turner 2001 smith turner 2001 the more saline the river water the larger the recirculation zone beneath the river due to larger buoyancy forces lenkopane et al 2009 like saltwater intrusion at the coast tidal forcing at the river boundary causes groundwater levels to fluctuate with tides which also increases mixing of groundwater and river water widens the freshwater saltwater transition zone due to hydrodynamic dispersion and forms an upper convective recirculation zone adjacent to the riverbank fig 1 lenkopane et al 2009 robinson et al 2007 although vertical flows are known to occur in these groundwater discharge zones sadat noori et al 2021 santos et al 2012 the present study did not specifically investigate vertical groundwater flows riparian si is driven by factors affecting both surface water and groundwater processes such as the river aquifer hydraulic gradient hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneity of riverbed and adjacent aquifer and river salinity lenkopane et al 2009 shalem et al 2015 shalem et al 2019 trefry et al 2007 vandenbohede et al 2008 webster et al 1996 although riparian si is a natural process anthropogenic forces such as land drainage and reclamation groundwater and surface water extraction to meet the growing demands of coastal populations and industries renken et al 2005 zhu et al 2020 riverbed mining lu et al 2007 or dredging parker et al 1955 can increase its severity furthermore riparian si will likely be exacerbated by climate change projections of sea level rise increased frequency and duration of droughts increased frequency and intensity of storms and tides and reduced river flows anderson lockaby 2012 tully et al 2019 a review of the literature indicates that most field methods to characterise riparian si can be categorized into i time series measurements of groundwater and surface water level electrical conductivity and temperature ii geophysical methods cross checked with piezometer data and iii analyses of groundwater and surface water chemistry and other water quality parameters table 2 this review excluded studies on groundwater discharge into estuarine rivers or creeks as these studies focus more on surface water dynamics and investigations instead of the adjacent shallow groundwater processes e g glaser et al 2021 gleeson et al 2013 peterson et al 2019 peterson et al 2010 time series measurements of groundwater and surface water level electrical conductivity or temperature are the most widely used method and provides temporal variation at specific points most studies used time series measurements as complimentary to other analyses and did not analyse and discuss these temporal variations in detail an exception is shalem et al 2019 where the dynamic response of a coastal aquifer adjacent to a bar built estuarine river n b non tidal for most of the year was explored using time series data of groundwater and river level and salinity across a transect perpendicular to the river in contrast the present study monitored a river and groundwater system that were consistently influenced by tides this is important because saltwater intrusion under tidal forcing resulted in pronounced changes in groundwater flow patterns and velocities ataie ashtiani et al 1999 and increased groundwater salinity adjacent to the estuarine river or estuary bank compared to a non tidal setting lenkopane et al 2009 werner lockington 2006 additionally geophysical methods are useful to map the extent and shape of saltwater plumes adjacent to and under rivers at a point in time and to visualize aquifer heterogeneity furthermore groundwater chemistry analyses provide delineation of potential origins of flow as a snapshot in time the transience of si occurring at the ocean boundary has been classified into active and passive depending on the direction of groundwater flow fetter 2001 werner 2016 this study proposes that this is a useful classification for riparian si despite its consideration of a simple two dimensional aquifer as well as the differences between si from the coast and estuarine rivers outlined in table 1 adapted to a riparian setting active si occurs when river water flows in the same direction as groundwater flow and the hydraulic gradient dips toward the aquifer while passive si occurs when river water flows against the direction of groundwater flow and the hydraulic gradient dips toward the river the case of passive active si defined by werner 2016 is not considered here as this study focuses on groundwater conditions directly adjacent to a tidal river and excludes areas further inland where a groundwater mound a specific requirement for the active passive case would be located although studies have assessed river aquifer hydraulic gradients e g shalem et al 2019 and darcy fluxes e g zamora et al 2021 no study has systematically analysed the transience of riparian si based on si classifications to the authors knowledge the analysis of time series field data is therefore required to verify and improve conceptualizations of transient riparian si in aotearoa new zealand where this study is conducted groundwater salinization due to sea level rise has been considered as one of the most urgent areas requiring further research for climate change adaptation ministry for the environment 2020 to the authors knowledge there has been no publication nationally on a field investigation of si from an estuarine river additionally although aotearoa new zealand has an abundance of freshwater supply and was ranked as having one of the highest total renewable freshwater resources per capita among oecd countries oecd 2022 increased groundwater extraction to meet growing demands from aquifers hydraulically connected to estuarine rivers can result in increased si peters et al 2022 furthermore groundwater table rise due to sea level rise is a concern in aotearoa new zealand ministry for the environment 2020 and many coastal areas worldwide bosserelle et al 2022a as drains may be increasingly installed to lower the water table the inadvertent risk of drawing saltwater from estuarine water bodies may also increase this research can therefore serve as an important case study both nationally and internationally to characterize the dynamics of riparian si from which future risks and adaptive measures can be determined this study aimed to document a case of riparian si in the field and expands on the current literature including shalem et al 2019 by examining riparian si dynamics convective recirculation of brackish river water and relating field observations to modelled riparian si phenomena such as fresh groundwater discharge tube and cyclical flows lenkopane et al 2009 linderfelt turner 2001 smith turner 2001 trefry et al 2007 xiao et al 2019 this paper also enhanced current methodologies of studying riparian si by applying density correction to hydraulic head measurements and quantifying freshwater head and horizontal hydraulic gradient uncertainties using error propagation methods post et al 2018 to determine river aquifer flow directions furthermore signal processing techniques which are increasingly applied in hydrogeology such as cross correlation and fourier analysis e g canul macario et al 2020 levanon et al 2017 levanon et al 2013 pacheco castro et al 2021 shalem et al 2019 were employed to analyse the relationship and lag time between the sea estuarine river and groundwater this study can also be useful to other riparian si investigations by providing detailed methods on the post processing analyses and interpretation of standard time series data water level and specific conductance as well as insights on the design of riparian si monitoring programmes 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study site is located in ōtautahi christchurch forthwith ōtautahi on the east coast of te waipounamu the south island of aotearoa new zealand the ancestral home of ngāi tahu and ngāi tūāhuriri who exercise mana whenua indigenous sovereignty hobbs et al 2022 ōtautahi is a coastal low lying city with a flat topography and an elevation of around 20 m above sea level hobbs et al 2022 built on swampland drained by european settlers wilson 1989 the climate is temperate with a median annual precipitation of 618 mm year 1 and a median annual average temperature of 11 12 c macara 2016 the population of ōtautahi is 394 700 stats nz 2020 which relies solely on groundwater for its water supply christchurch city council 2021 the ōtautahi coastal aquifer system was formed by the glaciation interglaciation and sea level fluctuation cycle during the quaternary period resulting in a multi layered confined unconfined aquifer system that extends offshore please refer to figure 23 in begg et al 2015 for a hydrostratigraphic profile showing strata sequence the artesian aquifer layers consist of predominantly fluvial gravel deposited during glacial or low sea level periods separated by lower permeability layers consisting predominantly of fine deposits of sand silt and clay with wood peat with shells sometimes present deposited during interglacial or high sea level periods begg et al 2015 the deepest bore drilled in ōtautahi revealed a total of sixteen separate sequences of high and low permeability strata down to 241 m brown 1998 the dominant groundwater recharge source is seepage from the waimakariri river an alpine fed braided river with highly permeable gravel bed located north of ōtautahi and rainfall upgradient of the city stewart 2012 the gravel aquifers are a highly productive source of freshwater for ōtautahi residents some of which is extracted for large scale agricultural use further inland in the waitaha canterbury plains brown 2001 parts of ōtautahi comprise a discharge zone with an upward hydraulic gradient cox et al 2021 where groundwater resurfaces as springs which provide river base flows stewart et al 2018 and via artesian wells drilled into confined strata the focus of this study is the christchurch formation which is the surficial or water table aquifer of the ōtautahi coastal aquifer system the christchurch formation is up to 56 m deep at the coast gradually thins inland and ends approximately 10 km from the coastline begg et al 2015 it is made of holocene age beach estuarine lagoon dune and coastal swamp deposits of gravel sand silt clay shell and peat that varies spatially brown weeber 1992 white 2007 for example the shallow aquifer is made of predominantly sand along the coast and made of sand silt and peat of drained estuaries around the inside of river meanders and the river mouth areas brown weeber 1992 the spatial distribution of the shallow aquifer material is indicated by the soil map presented in fig 2 e landcare research 2019 where soil type can correlate to the surficial geology and landform prior to large scale drainage environment canterbury et al 2019 at the transect location the soil type on the outside of the river meander true left was described as sandy while the soil type on the inside of the river meander true right was described as silty however average hydraulic conductivity values estimated from slug tests analysed using the hvorslev 1951 method conducted in september 2021 ranged from 15 to 46 m per day across all five bores which categorises the aquifer material as silty sand or clean sand freeze cherry 1979 hence the slug tests showed that the aquifer hydraulic conductivity in both sides of the river are similar this study focuses on si from the estuarine reach of the ōtākaro avon river forthwith ōtākaro into the adjacent christchurch formation aquifer the ōtākaro was a crucial mahinga kai food gathering place for ngāi tūāhuriri te tapuae o rehua university of otago n d waitaha ngāti māmoe and ngāi tahu iwi tribes prior to european colonisation christchurch city council n d the ōtākaro is an urban micro tidal river that receives base flow from the christchurch formation as well as the underlying semi confined riccarton gravel aquifer at the headwater sites further inland cameron 1992 tidal signals propagate from pegasus bay to the ihutai avon heathcote estuary forthwith ihutai and later up the ōtākaro fig 2d with specific time lags macpherson 1978 orchard et al 2020a the comparison of the deepest points between the estuary bed existing in the estuary mouth and the riverbed revealed that the ihutai estuary was approximately 3 to 4 m deeper than the riverbed at the transects in fig 2c measures bind 2013 the maximum seawater encroachment into the ōtākaro under current sea level was modelled at around 5 km upstream of the river mouth reference point fig 2d during a spring tide event and 20 exceedance river flow i e river flow that is exceeded 20 of the time of 2 07 m3s 1 orchard measures 2016 the lower ōtākaro riverbed is generally expected to be less conductive than the aquifer however the authors are not aware of any study that has analysed riverbed sediment deeper than the top 1 2 cm e g bolton ritchie 2015 gadd skyes 2014 the top 2 3 cm of riverbed sediment in the lower ōtākaro at approximately the river logger location in fig 2c has been described as predominantly composed of silt clay and fine sand gadd skyes 2014 the mean river flow at the non tidal reach 14 km upstream of the river mouth reference point in fig 2d was 1 85 m3s 1 from 2018 to 2022 environment canterbury unpublished data median water table level contours from 2016 to 2020 by bosserelle et al 2022b from 265 bores across the city fig 2d showed groundwater mounds on either side of the lower ōtākaro which roughly indicated perpendicular groundwater flow toward the river fig 2d unfortunately no monitoring bores exist on the coastal true left side of the transects to confirm the groundwater flow direction in this sand dune area therefore this study is limited by assuming perpendicular groundwater flow to the river due to insufficient bore infrastructure the transect setup here i e perpendicular to the river is also similar to shalem et al 2019 bosserelle et al 2022b also showed that tidal signal propagation was strongest and quickest in shallow bores along the tidal river compared to those located along the coast e g at the sand spit between the estuary and the ocean this suggests that tidal signals propagate through the estuary up the rivers and into the shallow aquifer most efficiently compared to the christchurch formation unit from the coast or other pathways that may exist additionally locations of brackish shallow groundwater in the christchurch formation have been identified around the inside of the estuarine ōtākaro meander and the sand dune spit located between the ihutai avon heathcote estuary and the ocean highlighted in fig 2d setiawan et al 2022 the lower reaches of the ōtākaro experienced land subsidence following the 2010 11 canterbury earthquake sequence for example bexley the suburb where part of the study site was located experienced an average land subsidence of 0 52 m hughes et al 2015 quigley et al 2016 the land subsidence in the lower reaches of the ōtākaro simulated a local sea level rise effect orchard et al 2020b which increased seawater encroachment further up the river in ōtautahi climate change has been modelled to increase the potential for drought increase mean sea level by 1 2 m by 2110 relative to the baseline of 1985 2005 under worst case emissions scenario increase high tide levels and reduce mean annual low river flows macara et al 2020 more impactful than sea level rise parts of ōtautahi are experiencing a high rate of land subsidence of up to 6 mm year 1 in the vicinity of the study site which are underlain by soft sediments pearson et al 2021 both land subsidence and climate change are likely to increase riparian si vulnerability particularly during summer low flow conditions 2 2 drilling methods two transects comprised of five shallow piezometers were used in this study fig 2 four out of five piezometers were constructed from slotted pvc and were drilled along the ōtākaro tidal reach these piezometers were 32 mm in diameter and were drilled using the lost cone method eijkelkamp n d in february 2020 no soil samples were retrievable as this was not possible using this drilling approach the slotted pvc screens were wrapped in a filter sleeve to avoid sedimentation the remaining shallow piezometer 1 l2 used in the study was part of an existing shallow groundwater monitoring network owned by the christchurch city council it was drilled using the sonic method in june 2016 was capped at the bottom and had a diameter of 50 mm all piezometer screens were in the christchurch formation the five piezometers in this study were part of the shallow groundwater salinity survey of ōtautahi setiawan et al 2022 where piezometers 1 r and 2 r were found to be among the most saline in the survey fig 2d three of the five monitored shallow piezometers 1 r 2 r and 2 l see fig 2c are located on land severely affected by liquefaction following the 2010 11 canterbury earthquake sequence termed the residential red zone the horizontal and vertical positions of well casings measuring points were surveyed using a trimble real time kinematic rtk with a horizontal accuracy of 1 cm and vertical accuracy of 1 5 cm the piezometer depths were measured using a weighted measuring tape the local vertical datum lvd used in this study was lyttelton vertical datum 1937 which sits 0 19 m below mean sea level over 2002 2020 land information new zealand 2021b or 1 24 m above the chart datum land information new zealand 2021c the distance between each piezometer to the river edge was measured using a measuring tape where possible the distance between a piezometer and the river edge that crossed a busy road was measured using arcgis esri 2021 and aerial imagery eagle technology et al 2021 transect 1 located approximately 1 8 km upstream of the ōtākaro river mouth reference point fig 2d was comprised of two wells on the true left of the river 1 l1 and 1 l2 and one well on the true right of the river 1 r transect 2 located approximately 1 3 km upstream of the river mouth was comprised of one well on the true left of the river 2 l and one well on the true right of the river 2 r loggers measuring river level electrical conductivity and temperature were in the river between the two transects approximately 1 6 km upstream of the river mouth although the river loggers were not directly aligned with the transects due to installation difficulties the river logger location between the two transects is considered a valid approximation of river behaviour at the transects 2 3 groundwater and river level temperature electrical conductivity and sea level measurements groundwater and river level temperature and electrical conductivity were measured every 10 min for over five months from 1 january 2021 to 9 june 2021 the monitoring period used was the longest continuous data collected over a sixteen month period as datalogger failures occurred and tampering of equipment was commonly encountered in the urban river large parts of the results and discussion sections focus on summer dry periods january to february 2021 to characterise groundwater response to tides in the absence of rainfall groundwater level temperature and electrical conductivity in the piezometers were measured using a solinst ltc levelogger edge model 3001 m10 except for 1 l2 where an m30 version was installed solinst canada ltd 2020 the loggers were suspended at the piezometer screen using stainless steel wire the manufacturer specified accuracy for the level measurements are 1 5 cm and 0 5 cm for the m30 and the m10 models respectively while the typical clock drift is 1 min year and the electrical conductivity accuracy is 1 at 5 000 80 000 µscm 1 and 2 or 15 µscm 1 whichever is greater for 80 5 000 µscm 1 for both m30 and m10 models the temperature accuracy is 0 05 c for both models manual groundwater level readings were conducted using the solinst tlc 40 m solinst canada ltd 2017 air pressure was recorded using a solinst barologger edge model 3001 solinst canada ltd 2020 for barometric compensation of groundwater level readings with an accuracy of 0 05 kpa equivalent to 0 51 cm of water within approximately 3 km from the piezometer transects river electrical conductivity and temperature were measured using an odyssey conductivity and temperature logger with a calibrated range of 1 000 to 60 000 µs cm 1 dataflow systems ltd n d the manufacturer specified accuracy for the electrical conductivity is 3 or 200 µs cm 1 whichever is greater and the worst case clock drift is 1 min month the logger was tied to a brick and sunk to the bottom of the river at the location shown on the transect map fig 1b river level was measured using a hobo u20l 01 water level logger onset computer corporation 2018 with an accuracy of 1 2 cm water and the clock drift was 1 min month the river level logger was suspended in the river using stainless steel wire inside a pvc tube with holes attached to a waratah hammered into the riverbed by a jetty for ease of access elevation surveys of the waratah before and after the monitoring period showed that it was stable throughout the monitoring period comparison between the internal logger and computer clocks was not possible for both river loggers because there was no functionality for this within both manufacturer s software all data were downloaded using a computer set to new zealand standard time i e without daylight saving adjustment all groundwater river and air pressure loggers were downloaded two times throughout the monitoring period and the internal logger clocks were re set to synchronise with the computer clock at each download the largest difference between the internal clock and computer clock was 67 s for all groundwater and air pressure loggers which did not cause any perceptible difference in the hydraulic head or specific conductance interpretations therefore no clock shift adjustments were made to the dataset sea level records were derived as secondary data from land information new zealand 2021d measured using a ge druck ptx 1830 pressure transducer ge druck n d with an accuracy of 1 2 cm and located approximately 7 5 km from the piezometers at sumner tide gauge location shown in fig 2d data downloaded from the loggers were post processed using pandas mckinney 2010 and visualised using matplotlib hunter 2007 both of which are open source python libraries erroneous data points associated with logger downloads were manually removed and the empty values were populated using 5th order polynomial interpolation in pandas the calculations in the following subsections were conducted subsequently 2 4 conversion to specific conductance and density electrical conductivity increases with temperature by about 2 for every c increase jiao post 2019 miller et al 1988 therefore groundwater electrical conductivity ec was compensated for temperature by conversion into specific conductance sc which is electrical conductivity at a reference temperature here 25 c is used 1 sc ec 1 0 02 t 25 where t is the recorded water temperature in c sc can be used as a proxy for salinity which is common practice jiao post 2019 sc can be converted to total dissolved solids tds by 2 tds k e s c where k e is a conversion factor that depends on the chemical make up of the water sample and 0 68 is commonly used as a first approximation for mixtures of freshwater and seawater jiao post 2019 in this study salt concentration is assumed to be equal to tds salt concentration c ml 3 can be converted to density ρ ml 3 by langevin et al 2008 3 ρ ρ 0 ρ c c c 0 where ρ0 ml 3 is the reference density which is 1 000 kg m 3 ρ c is the approximate change in density over change in salinity which is 0 7 and c0 ml 3 is the reference concentration for density which is 0 kg m 3 the temperature term was removed from the equation because the reference temperature of 25 c was equal to the recorded temperature i e sc at 25 c and therefore the temperature term equated to zero to justify the use of equation 3 river and groundwater samples were analysed for density in the laboratory using a pycnometer these empirical density measurements were compared with density values determined from equation 3 the relationships between density and sc based on empirical measurements and equation 3 had minimal difference and would have negligible effect in freshwater head and flow direction interpretations therefore equation 3 was used for density conversion 2 5 conversion to freshwater head the total groundwater pressure recorded by the pressure transducer p ml 1t 2 was converted to water column height hpt l as rau et al 2019 4 h pt p p b ρ a g where pb is the recorded barometric pressure ml 1t 2 ρa is the average groundwater density over the water column ml 3 g is the gravitational acceleration constant mt 2 which is 9 81 ms 2 the density of water at the sensor location was assumed to be the average density of the water column to estimate the error associated with this assumption the difference between the density reading at the sensor location and the average water column density was calculated both converted from sc the average water column density was determined by measuring sc profiles using solinst ltc leveloggers installed in each well connected to a direct read cable solinst canada ltd 2020 the sc profiles were measured by logging sc readings every meter down the measuring point at two second intervals for a few minutes until just above the well bottom averaged for each depth values before reaching equilibrium were excluded and then converted to density the average water column density was calculated using the methods of post et al 2018 the groundwater level elevation relative to the local vertical datum lyttelton 1937 datum h l was derived by 5 h m p d pt h pt where mp l is the measuring point elevation relative to the local vertical datum and dpt l is the pressure transducer depth from the measuring point to its zero point the h was converted to freshwater head to correctly interpret groundwater flow direction and magnitude post et al 2007 freshwater head hf l is defined as post et al 2018 6 h f ρ a h ρ a ρ f z ρ f where ρf ml 3 is the freshwater density and z l is the elevation of the bottom of the well relative to the local vertical datum 2 6 uncertainty of freshwater heads and horizontal hydraulic gradients the uncertainty of freshwater heads was expressed as the standard deviation of freshwater head σhf this was determined using the freshwater head error propagation method outlined in post et al 2018 which requires inferring the standard deviations of ρ and z the standard deviation of ρ σρ was inferred as 1 kgm 3 as a conservative estimate following post et al 2018 given the difference between average water column density and density measured at the sensor locations were below this shown in the results section the standard deviation of z σz used was 0 015 m considering the rtk survey accuracy the standard deviation of h residuals i e the difference between manual and datalogger measurements of groundwater level σh of individual wells were used shown in the results section the uncertainty of either δhf l the difference between river and groundwater freshwater head and δx l the distance from a piezometer to the closest river edge can be derived using basic error propagation rules given the errors in the measurements of hf and x are random and uncorrelated post et al 2018 7 σ δ σ 1 2 σ 2 2 where σ on the right hand side is the standard deviation of hf or x the standard deviation of x σx were inferred as 1 m due to the estimated change in the river edge from tidal fluctuations the relative error of the horizontal hydraulic gradient δhf δx can be determined as post et al 2018 8 σ i i σ δ h f δ h f 2 σ x δ x 2 where i represents δhf δx for brevity 2 7 cross correlation analysis the cross correlation analysis determines the relationship of two time series as a function of time lag or offset kim et al 2008 this analysis was applied to time series data of sea river and groundwater levels it was not applied to the sc signals as they had irregular waveforms except for river sc cross correlation is a measure of similarity of two time series x and y with their respective units of length n at time i t as a function of time lag k t the cross covariance function cxy k is defined as thomson emery 2014 9 c xy k 1 n k i 1 n k y i y x i k x the cross correlation coefficient function ρxy is defined as thomson emery 2014 10 ρ xy c xy k σ x σ y where σx and σy are the standard deviations of x and y the maximum cross correlation coefficient forthwith r with a range from 0 to 1 denotes the interdependency between the two time series while taking into account the time lag kim et al 2008 the larger the r value the stronger the interdependency between two time series 2 8 discrete fourier transform the discrete fourier transform dft transforms data from a function of time and signal e g head and sc measurements into frequency and power allowing the separation of cyclic drivers in groundwater data such as ocean earth and atmospheric tides and their significance acworth et al 2015 in this study dft was used to separate the influence of tidal signals in groundwater and river time series dft is expressed as e g acworth et al 2015 11 x k n 0 n 1 x n e 2 π kn n where x k is the frequency spectrum of the time series x n with length n here dft was computed using fast fourier transform or fft from the scipy library which is an open source collection of algorithms for scientific computing in python virtanen et al 2020 the fft was applied to a subset of the dataset during a summer dry period in january 2021 the driest month of the year on average national institute of water and atmospheric research 2022 this was because it allowed us to focus on background signals unaffected by rain 3 results 3 1 riparian si dynamics this section presents riparian si dynamics at the two transects using measured data and analysis techniques described in the methods section sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 3 on freshwater head and sc dynamics elaborate on groundwater and river behaviours during a no rainfall period to focus on characterising groundwater response to tides taking the period of 1 to 4 february 2021 as an example which is representative of a summer dry period 3 1 1 freshwater head dynamics sea level at sumner the nearest tide gauge shown in fig 2d ranged from 1 75 m to 1 84 m lvd and averaged at 0 27 m lvd with a standard deviation of 0 61 m throughout the monitoring period i e 1 january to 9 june 2021 time series of sea level river level and river sc in early february 2021 are shown in fig 3 the prevailing tidal regime around aotearoa new zealand including sumner is semidiurnal walters et al 2001 similar to the observations in fig 3 tides change river level with their ebb and flow the river freshwater heads at the monitored location ranged from 0 16 to 1 94 m lvd and averaged at 0 50 m lvd with a standard deviation of 0 42 m throughout the monitoring period the river freshwater head amplitude at the monitored location was approximately 60 of the sea level amplitude the river sc dynamics will be elaborated later in section 3 1 3 freshwater heads at transects 1 and 2 fluctuate with estuarine river heads fig 4 a and fig 5 a the error shades were calculated based on the standard deviation values in table 3 the rise and fall of river and groundwater freshwater head curves were observed to be asymmetric the freshwater head curves were quicker to reach their peaks compared to the troughs in transect 1 on the true left side the freshwater head in the piezometer closer to the river 1 l1 rose above the freshwater head in the piezometer further away from the river 1 l2 during and around high tide although the error bands between the two freshwater heads overlapped fig 4 during and around low tide the freshwater head in 1 l2 also rose above that in 1 l1 the ebb and flow of tides were expected to drive groundwater flow in the adjacent aquifer in both transects the freshwater heads and hydraulic gradient on the true left side of the river were on average greater than that on the true right side fig 6 and table 3 the mean freshwater head at 1 r was equal to that at the river indicating a mean hydraulic gradient of zero additionally the largest mean freshwater head was observed at 2 l amongst the monitored piezometers the freshwater head standard deviations in the piezometers were smaller than in the river fig 6 amongst the piezometers the largest freshwater head standard deviation was observed in 2 r and the smallest in 1 l2 the freshwater head standard deviations in transect 1 were on average smaller than that in transect 2 in addition the freshwater head standard deviation at 1 l1 was larger than at 1 l2 which is further inland 3 1 2 cross correlation based on cross correlation analysis river level peaks lagged sea level peaks by 1 5 h r 0 95 and the river sc peaks lagged river level peaks by 40 min r 0 95 in february 2021 the occurrence of river sc peaks following river level peaks was similarly observed by orchard and measures 2016 in the tidal reach of the ōtākaro unpublished raw data the cross correlation analysis also showed that the maximum freshwater head in all piezometers generally occurred within 30 min after the maximum freshwater head in the river table 4 the piezometer with the shortest lag time was 1 l1 which was also located closest to the river the piezometer with the longest lag time was 1 l2 located inland of 1 l1 the r values ranged from 0 86 to 0 98 across all piezometers 3 1 3 sc dynamics river sc fluctuated with the ebb and flow of tides fig 3 at the river logger location the river changed from fresh to saline within a tidal cycle throughout the monitoring period river sc ranged from 791 µscm 1 1 4 seawater to 42 032 µscm 1 76 seawater with an average of 12 077 µscm 1 and standard deviation of 11 249 µscm 1 fig 6 groundwater sc at the piezometers also fluctuated with the ebb and flow of the estuarine river fig 4 and fig 5 except 2 l during the period shown elaborated further below groundwater sc on the true right side of the river is on average approximately 10 times more saline than that on the true left side of the river fig 6 the sc at 2 l was consistently fresh throughout the monitoring period and at times did not fluctuate with tides such as during the monitoring period shown in fig 5 while 2 l was the freshest bore 2 r on the opposite side of the river was the most saline fig 6 the average sc at 2 r was 17 132 µscm 1 31 seawater which was nearly 34 times greater than the average sc on the opposite side of the river at 2 l 508 µscm 1 fresh water in the time series shown in figs 4 and 5 the sc fluctuation in response to the tidal saltwater pulse was greatest at 2 r compared to the other bores the sc fluctuation at 1 r was smaller compared to 1 l1 and 1 l2 even though 1 r was on average eight times more saline than 1 l1 and seven times more saline than 1 l2 meanwhile groundwater sc and its amplitude at 1 l2 was consistently greater at 1 l1 during dry periods even though 1 l2 is further inland compared to 1 l1 however 1 l2 is approximately 1 6 m deeper compared to 1 l1 table 3 and fig 6 attempts to run cross correlation between river and groundwater sc resulted in unreliable time lag results due to the irregular wave forms encountered in the sc datasets consequently the time lag between groundwater and river sc peaks on 1 february 2021 was analysed using manual calculations table 5 groundwater sc peaks at 1 l1 located 5 m from the river had a time lag of 8 h 50 min following river sc peaks in contrast groundwater sc peaks at 1 l2 located further away at 23 m from the river had a smaller time lag following the river sc peaks of 1 h 50 min there was no observable groundwater sc peak at 2 l during the period analysed piezometers on the true right side of the river had larger lag times at 10 h 40 min 1 r and 12 h 2 r compared to 1 l2 on the true left side at a similar distance from the river 3 1 4 horizontal river aquifer hydraulic gradient hydraulic gradient the driving force of groundwater flow in the direction of maximum decreasing total head cheremisinoff 1997 fluctuated from positive to negative values with tides across all piezometers fig 4c and fig 5c generally during and around high tide the freshwater head at the river rose above that in the adjacent aquifer the hydraulic gradient dipped towards the aquifer and the direction of flow was from the river to the aquifer i e i 0 indicating river water infiltration meanwhile during and around ebb tide the river freshwater head declined and the reverse hydraulic gradient occurred whereby the freshwater heads in the adjacent aquifer were larger than in the river here the direction of flow was from the aquifer to the river i e i 0 indicating groundwater discharge the piezometers spent more time in positive compared to negative hydraulic gradient during the observation period shown in figs 4 and 5 like the freshwater head curves the hydraulic gradient curves were also asymmetric more time was needed to reach maximum hydraulic gradient i e maximum groundwater discharge compared to minimum hydraulic gradient i e maximum river water infiltration this time difference between infiltration and discharge has also been observed in the seawater recirculation process due to tidal pumping in unconfined beach aquifer settings whereby seawater infiltrated quicker during high tide and was slower to discharge during low tide resulting in higher time averaged water table levels compared to sea levels thus groundwater flow was driven towards the ocean santos et al 2012 in transect 1 the hydraulic gradient was steepest at 1 l1 located closest to the river fig 4c and table 3 in transect 2 negative hydraulic gradients at 2 l and 2 r indicated similar ranges but the positive hydraulic gradients at 2 l rose approximately twice as large than 2 r at their peaks fig 5c on average 1 r had the lowest hydraulic gradient while 2 l on the other hand had the highest hydraulic gradient throughout the monitoring period table 3 3 1 5 dft dft alters data from a function of time and signal into frequency and power extracting individual cyclic drivers within river and groundwater time series e g ocean earth and atmospheric tides this research focuses on ocean tide signals the stronger a periodic signal within a time series the greater its amplitude or prominence at this frequency following dft therefore prominent frequencies are strong cyclical signals occurring within the time series lunar and solar gravitational forces acting on the earth and the rotation of the earth cause the periodic rise and fall of ocean tides merritt 2004 time series data of sea level river and groundwater heads and sc in january 2021 were transformed into frequency domains using dft fig 7 the dft of sea level time series at sumner beach tide gauge location shown in fig 2a demonstrated that the most prominent frequency occurred at 1 936 cycles per day table 6 and fig 7a the dominant tidal constituent at the ihutai estuary mouth is the lunar semidiurnal or m2 walters et al 2001 which occur every 12 4 h or at a frequency of 1 932 cycles per day merritt 2004 and approximately coincides with the prominent energy peak of 1 936 cycles per day at the local tide gauge meanwhile the dft of river heads and sc fig 7b and c as well as groundwater heads and sc e g at 2 r in fig 7d and e showed the most prominent frequency to be occurring at 1 935 cycles per day table 6 the frequency domains of the remaining piezometers are shown in figure s1 within the supplementary materials the slight difference between the m2 tidal signal occurring at 1 932 cycles per day and the prominent frequency in the sea level of 1 936 cycles per day as well as in the river and groundwater of 1 935 cycles per day could be due to the short period of the analysed record i e one month and the subsequent blending of various tidal constituents the amplitudes of tidal signals attenuated from the sea up the river and further inland within the aquifer table 6 however the sc amplitude was larger in 1 l2 than 1 l1 even though 1 l2 is located further inland the most saline well 2 r showed the strongest tidal signal in its freshwater head and sc the freshest well 2 l also showed comparatively strong tidal signals in its freshwater head but the weakest tidal signal in its sc the sc amplitude was smaller at 1 r compared to 1 l1 and 1 l2 even though 1 r was more saline than 1 l1 and 1 l2 4 discussion groundwater sc peaks were observed to occur hours after river sc peaks or shortly prior to the next river sc peak as shown in fig 4b fig 5b and table 5 riparian si observed here is part of a cyclic system with complex flow processes and there can naturally be different lags in the aquifer response to the salinity stressor at a timescale that is hard to predict trefry et al 2007 three dimensional modelling of a seasonally saline river and the adjacent aquifer by trefry et al 2007 observed that saline wedge expansion in the aquifer counter intuitively occurred during low river salinity periods they found that the dominant stressor e g increase in river salinity and its effect e g the expansion of saline wedge can vary out of phase which may be improbable in steady systems but natural in cyclical systems such as aquifers adjacent to seasonally saline surface water bodies piezometer 1 l1 was observed to be consistently fresher than 1 l2 during dry periods even though 1 l1 is located closer to the estuarine river fig 4 piezometer 1 l1 is shallower than 1 l2 by nearly 1 6 m and hence the screen of 1 l1 may not be intercepting the denser brackish water which will sink deeper into the aquifer as observed previously by shalem et al 2019 another possible explanation is that the screen of 1 l1 is intercepting a zone of fresh groundwater discharging back into the river this phenomenon has been observed in a beach ocean setting by robinson et al 2007 who termed it the freshwater discharge tube lenkopane et al 2009 and xiao et al 2019 showed in their model of si from a partially penetrating estuary with tidally varying salinity that this freshwater discharge tube also likely exists in tidal estuarine settings they showed that there are two mixed recirculation zones one beneath the estuary bed and one adjacent to the estuary bank fig 1 sandwiched between these two circulation zones is a zone where fresh groundwater originating from further inland was funnelled and discharged back into the estuary xiao et al 2019 showed that the fresh groundwater tube was present at low tides and rising mid tides but disappeared at high tides and falling mid tides because of surface water infiltration the fresher groundwater measured at 1 l1 compared to 1 l2 may be hypothesized to exist due to a freshwater discharge tube in westbrook et al 2005 a cross sectional electrical conductivity map of a shallow groundwater system adjacent to an estuarine river also showed a funnelling of fresh groundwater discharge between an upper saline brackish plume and a saltwater wedge at the aquifer bottom additionally during periods when the gradient between the river and groundwater freshwater head indicated flow from the river to the aquifer i e i 0 the sc at 1 l1 was observed to decline unlike observations at other piezometers which is contrary to expectations while this may be related to the presence of a freshwater discharge tube it may also be due to processes that are not yet able to be explained in this research in response to an oceanic tidal fluctuation river level peak was observed to occur first at 1 5 h lag followed by groundwater level peak at approximately 2 h lag across all bores river sc peak at 2 2 h lag and lastly groundwater sc peak at 4 5 to 14 7 h lag during a dry period on 1 february 2021 an exception was piezometer 2 l where no groundwater sc peak was observed the analysis of tide induced groundwater level and salinity fluctuations in a coastal unconfined aquifer also observed that the time lag between sea level and groundwater level fluctuations was smaller than the time lag between sea level and groundwater salinity fluctuations at the same location within the freshwater saltwater interface levanon et al 2017 additionally the cross correlation analysis showed very strong relationships between river and groundwater freshwater heads r values ranged from 0 86 to 0 98 throughout the monitoring period these r values are comparable to kim et al 2008 who analysed groundwater electrical conductivity time series data in relation to tides in a coastal si setting interestingly piezometer 1 l2 located further from the river 23 m from the riverbank experienced sc peaks earlier compared to 1 l1 located closer to the river 5 m from the riverbank however piezometer 1 l2 is 1 6 m deeper than 1 l1 fig 6 as previously mentioned based on the conceptual model in fig 1 lenkopane et al 2009 smith turner 2001 saltwater enters predominantly from the bottom of the river and flows toward the bottom of the aquifer and outside of the wedge before discharging back into the riverbank therefore in this case the deeper piezometer further away from the river may be hypothesised to receive saltwater flow before the piezometer closer to the river alternatively a preferential saltwater flow path from the river toward 1 l2 may be hypothesised to exist the fourier analysis confirmed the tidal nature of the ōtākaro and the adjacent groundwater at the monitored transects the prominent m2 lunar semi diurnal signal occurring every 12 4 h or 1 935 cycles per day was detected in the freshwater heads and sc at the river and piezometers with varying amplitudes or strengths at each location table 6 and fig 7 the most saline bore 2 r had the largest sc and freshwater head amplitudes among all the monitored bores although 2 l was the freshest bore with the smallest sc amplitude its freshwater head was strongly tidal as shown by its relatively large amplitude while tide induced groundwater level fluctuations have crucial implications for determining saltwater intrusion and groundwater discharge at the estuarine river boundary carey et al 2009 the degree of tidal influence in shallow groundwater level fluctuations at any given location does not indicate si tide induced groundwater level fluctuations can be detected significantly further inland than the extent of si depending on aquifer hydraulic properties jiao post 2019 tidally driven changes in river aquifer hydraulic gradients and river sc resulted in two observed processes with various time delays si and saltwater retreat the si process is characterised by the increase in groundwater sc and the landward movement of the freshwater saltwater interface with varying time lags relative to the increase in river sc here this study reflects on the classifications of active and passive si fetter 2001 werner 2016 in a riparian setting the conceptualization that follows assumes an almost immediate response from groundwater sc to changes in river aquifer hydraulic gradient and river sc which may be unlikely to occur in the field during low tide the freshwater head at the river was lower than in the aquifer as the incoming tide travelled upstream within the river the river freshwater head increased followed by the increase in river sc passive si would occur as the river head and sc were rising while the freshwater head at the aquifer was larger than in the river here groundwater discharge was present inferred from i 0 and flowing against the direction of river water into the aquifer active si would occur as the river freshwater head and sc continued to rise and the freshwater head at the river rose higher than that at the aquifer indicating the active flow of river water into the aquifer here both groundwater and river water flowed landward at high tide the river freshwater head was larger than in the aquifer as river freshwater head and sc further lowered during the ebbing tide the freshwater head at the aquifer became higher than in the river and groundwater discharge occurred inferred from i 0 and saltwater retreat i e the decrease in groundwater sc may occur tidally driven groundwater fluxes have been similarly observed in studies focused on submarine groundwater discharge into tidal creeks glaser et al 2021 gleeson et al 2013 at the local scale the ōtākaro has been classified as a gaining river throughout its reach i e constant presence of groundwater discharge yang et al 2019 but this study shows that parts of the tidal reach consistently change between gaining and losing although this study did not measure vertical flows the observations of freshwater head hydraulic gradient and sc showed that tidal pumping induced saltwater flow from the river into the aquifer during high tide but the salt was not completely returned during low tide i e the groundwater did not freshen to the same degree as the river the salt was then recirculated back in the aquifer during and around the subsequent high tide this tidal pumping effect was also revealed in the numerical modelling experiments of werner and lockington 2006 the recirculation of salt laden groundwater may indicate a mixed convective recirculation cell whereby the river water that flows into the aquifer mixes with the existing groundwater and discharged back into the river fig 1 linderfelt turner 2001 smith turner 2001 freshwater heads in the aquifer were on average greater than in the river fig 6 except for 1 r si and saltwater retreat occurred in a cyclical pattern fig 4 and fig 5 unless disrupted by recharge events or anthropogenic activities the percentage of time when the hydraulic gradient sloped towards the river i 0 versus towards the aquifer i 0 was analysed and compared to the percentage of time when the river sc was greater than groundwater sc and vice versa fig 8 generally groundwater sc became greater than river sc during low tide and the reverse occurred during high tide an exception was 2 l which most of the time had positive hydraulic gradients and was consistently fresher than the river during the observation period the wells on the true left side of the river more often had positive hydraulic gradients compared to those on the true right side and they were fresher than the river most of the time fig 8 except for 2 l as mentioned in contrast the wells on the true right side were more saline than the river most of the time and had negative hydraulic gradients for a higher percentage of time than wells on the true left side these results suggest that trends in the gradient between river and groundwater freshwater head is an important driver of groundwater salinity in shallow aquifers adjacent to estuarine rivers the transects in the present study were ideal for observing hydraulic gradient dynamics because the estimated hydraulic conductivities were similar across the sites and hence the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer and river or i became the dominant factor controlling the flux of river water into the aquifer or the occurrence of riparian si aquifer hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneity are crucial factors that influence riparian si the case study site of shalem et al 2019 and shalem et al 2015 by contrast to the current study had a marked difference in aquifer hydraulic conductivity between the silty and sand units at opposite sides of the river shalem et al 2019 found permeable sand lenses within the silty unit which created preferential flow paths for riparian si additionally they found higher salinity groundwater in the silty aquifer compared to the river water and concluded that past si events were better preserved in low permeability units as saltwater becomes entrapped within them furthermore vandenbohede et al 2008 found a semi pervious barrier within a dune aquifer system that impeded downward si from a tidal inlet the present study focused on tidally influenced river aquifer hydraulic gradient as a driving force for riparian si and aquifer heterogeneity was not investigated in addition to river aquifer hydraulic gradient and aquifer hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneity river morphology including degree of bank curvature and slope can influence riparian si as it is one of the driving factors for groundwater discharge into the river linderfelt turner 2001 smith turner 2001 linderfelt and turner 2001 observed that zones of groundwater discharge and low groundwater salinity were focussed on the outside of river meanders while the inside of river meanders were areas of low groundwater discharge sufficient for riparian si evident from the high groundwater salinity measurements zamora et al 2021 similarly observed areas of high electrical resistivity or low conductivity with evidence of groundwater discharge and upward groundwater flux along a cut bank area i e outside of a river meander in contrast a less electrically resistive zone or higher conductivity was found within the shallow part of the inner meander bank and at the river channel centre the outside of river meanders laterally cut deeper into the aquifer and thus captures a greater proportion of groundwater flow where steeper hydraulic gradients were observed compared to the inside of meanders jiao post 2019 linderfelt turner 2001 in this study lower salinity groundwater steeper hydraulic gradients and higher groundwater discharge to the river inferred from hydraulic gradients were also observed on the outside of the river meander true left side compared to the inside of the meander true right side river channel depth and bathymetry can also influence river salinity and riparian si the larger the cross sectional area of the river the greater the distance that saltwater can move upstream a rise in the river bottom blocks the saltwater wedge from penetrating further inland while an increase in river depth for example due to dredging or natural erosion increases the tidal range upstream and the tidal volume tuin 1991 for example extensive sand mining from the lower pearl river in china combined with reduced sediment load to the sea caused rapid channel incision i e increase in channel depth causing the longest lasting seawater encroachment occurrence in over 40 years and water supply issues in the surrounding cities lu et al 2007 piezometer 1 r was on average fresher than 2 r fig 6 even though 1 r experienced more negative hydraulic gradients than 2 r fig 8 which was initially unexpected upon further investigation the deepest point of the interpolated ōtākaro bathymetry in transect 2 was approximately 1 m deeper than transect 1 which may have contributed to the higher salinity in 2 r compared to 1 r as deeper river channels have been observed to cause greater si shallow groundwater salinity controls the type of vegetation that can grow holt et al 2017 wilson et al 2015 the presence of brackish shallow groundwater at the true right side of the river was also indicated by the abundance of saltmarsh plants such as glasswort salicornia quinqueflora and buck s horn plantain plantago coronopus the numerous dead trees as well as the large patches of bare soil with white crusts that may indicate saline soils daliakopoulos et al 2016 which may not be obvious to the hydrogeologist but would be to the ecologist or soil scientist fig 9 the post earthquake land subsidence of the ōtākaro river mouth area including bexley induced a local relative sea level rise orchard et al 2020b which may have increased the extent of riparian si and brought the brackish water table closer to ground surface these land subsidence effects would increase the groundwater sc adjacent to the river and the potential for capillary rise and increased evapotranspiration resulting in increased soil salinity greene et al 2016 4 1 limitations and recommendations for future work this study did not consider vertical flows due to a lack of piezometer infrastructure even though vertical flows are likely important in aquifers directly adjacent to estuarine water bodies lenkopane et al 2009 werner lockington 2006 xiao et al 2019 additionally this study assumed groundwater flow perpendicular to the river and did not consider other directions of lateral flow as there was insufficient bore infrastructure to implement a flow network horizontal fluxes were not quantified here as they were expected to only constitute a component of total flux it was not justifiable to solely focus on horizontal flux while ignoring vertical flux furthermore the time lags of groundwater sc peaks relative to river sc peaks were quantified manually instead of using signal processing techniques such as cross correlation due to the irregular wave forms of groundwater sc additional work may be needed to statistically quantify groundwater sc lags over time we recommend implementing a flow network and analysing lateral groundwater direction and fluxes over time e g over tidal cycles in sadat noori et al 2021 we also recommend installing nested piezometers in the aquifer adjacent to the estuarine river to monitor vertical fluxes and saltwater recirculation additionally the installation of in stream piezometers would enable the monitoring of vertical fluxes and provide insights on saltwater recirculation processes underneath the river however these recommendations may be technically challenging to apply particularly in urban and built environments future research could examine riparian si dynamics in the presence of recharge or with added stressors such as pumping and land drainage other field methods such as time lapse geophysical investigations can further help delineate the shape and extent of the freshwater saltwater interface and saltwater recirculation zones under si and saltwater retreat conditions 5 conclusions a field observation of riparian si was documented in the low lying coastal city of ōtautahi christchurch aotearoa new zealand across two transects of piezometers with similar hydraulic conductivities using time series measurements of groundwater and river freshwater head specific conductance and hydraulic gradient the uncertainties associated with the freshwater head and hydraulic head measurements were estimated using error propagation methods tidally driven changes in river aquifer hydraulic gradients and river sc resulted in the alternation of si increase in groundwater sc and saltwater retreat decrease in groundwater sc with various time delays in response to sea level fluctuation river level at the monitored site was observed to peak after around 1 5 h followed by groundwater level after approximately 2 h across all bores river sc after 2 2 h and finally groundwater sc after 4 5 to 14 7 h varies across all bores during a dry period on 1 february 2021 cross correlation analysis of river and groundwater freshwater heads at the piezometers showed very strong relationships r of 0 86 0 98 with time lags of 19 to 29 min throughout the monitoring period dft of freshwater head and sc in the river and adjacent groundwater confirmed the prominence of the m2 tidal signal with the most saline bore showing the greatest m2 amplitudes in both freshwater head and sc analyses river aquifer hydraulic gradient trends were observed to be an important driver of groundwater salinity in shallow aquifers adjacent to estuarine rivers the percentage of time that a piezometer experienced positive hydraulic gradients i e groundwater river freshwater head was related to the percentage of time that a piezometer was fresher than the river steeper river aquifer hydraulic gradients and fresher groundwater were found on the outside of the river meander compared to the inside of the river meander a phenomenon which has been previously observed e g linderfelt turner 2001 zamora et al 2021 the abundance of saltmarsh plants and crusty soils on the inside of the river meander also confirm the presence of brackish shallow groundwater additionally the roles of other important riparian si drivers in the observed system such as aquifer hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneity as well as river morphology and depth were discussed although positive hydraulic gradients occurred most of the time in the monitored bores alarming rates of land subsidence and future climate change conditions of sea level rise increased drought and decreased river flows may result in increased riparian si riparian si observations and groundwater sc lags that may seem counter intuitive were hypothesized to be driven by cyclic flow processes and the presence of a fresh groundwater discharge zone for example a piezometer that is closer to the river was observed to be consistently fresher with a slower sc response than a piezometer that is 1 6 m deeper and located 18 m further away perpendicularly from the river further research into these

2511,estuarine rivers provide critical pathways for seawater to travel upstream of the coast and salinize adjacent aquifers however this salinization mechanism forthwith termed riparian saltwater intrusion has received relatively little attention compared to saltwater intrusion si at the coast time series measurements of river and groundwater freshwater head and specific conductance sc as well as horizontal river aquifer hydraulic gradient were collected at transects of piezometers perpendicular to an estuarine river in ōtautahi christchurch aotearoa new zealand the uncertainties of freshwater head and hydraulic gradient were estimated using error propagation methods discrete fourier transforms were applied to river and groundwater freshwater head and sc time series data which confirmed the tidal influence in both systems cross correlation analyses of river and groundwater freshwater heads showed very strong relationships with varying time lags hydraulic gradients and river sc fluctuated with tides resulting in the alternation of si increase in groundwater sc and saltwater retreat decrease in groundwater sc with various time delays that may be driven by cyclic flow processes while riparian si occurred in most piezometers the hydraulic gradient on the outside of the river meander was steeper than on the inside of the river meander resulting in less si although positive hydraulic gradient aquifer to river flow direction occurred most of the time at all sites land subsidence and climate change conditions of sea level rise increased drought and decreased river

saltwater in an aquifer jiao post 2019 can contaminate freshwater supplies werner et al 2013 cause premature deterioration of co existing infrastructure luo et al 2015 eutrophication of surface water bodies weissman tully 2020 soil salinization prathapar et al 1992 and stress or death of salt intolerant species including crops and forests kirwan gedan 2019 impacting people s health shammi et al 2019 and livelihoods dasgupta et al 2014 velasquez manoff 2019 and the surrounding ecology tully et al 2019 while si primarily occurs from the coast surface water bodies connected to the sea such as rivers creeks canals or ditches provide critical pathways for seawater to travel upstream of the coast and salinize the adjacent groundwater body bhattachan et al 2018 parker et al 1955 renken et al 2005 tully et al 2019 under sea level rise scenarios increased si from estuarine water bodies could occur before tidal inundation at the surface and is therefore an issue at the forefront of climate change tully et al 2019 this research focuses on si from estuarine rivers a process which has received relatively little attention compared to si from the coast shalem et al 2015 shalem et al 2019 therefore this study presents a case study addition to the international literature here the term estuarine river is used to describe a river reach where river and ocean forcing tides and waves interact resulting in variable salinity water level and other properties based on hume et al 2007 the differences between si from the coast and si from estuarine rivers are elaborated in table 1 although the ocean estuarine surface water body and coastal groundwater systems are interconnected the source of saltwater intrusion e g estuarine river or ocean may be identified conceptually shown in fig 1 for example an estuarine river can be delineated as a source of salt when shallow groundwater is increasingly saline towards the river and decreasingly saline away from it si from estuarine rivers involve two distinct processes 1 the movement of saltwater from the sea up the river forthwith termed seawater encroachment and 2 the subsurface movement of saltwater from estuarine rivers into adjacent aquifers forthwith termed riparian si both surface water and subsurface processes are often confoundingly termed seawater or saltwater intrusion in the literature mikhailova 2013 werner et al 2013 while seawater encroachment has been extensively studied e g guerra chanis et al 2019 yuan et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 there has been comparatively limited research on riparian si existing studies in estuary aquifer settings with varying points of focus e g groundwater discharge instead of si have termed the area influenced by si through estuarine surface water bodies differently such as the hypoaigic zone trefry et al 2007 subterranean estuaries moore 1999 areas of saltwater infiltration vandenbohede et al 2008 or simply as zones of groundwater and surface water interaction westbrook et al 2005 creating difficulties in discovering literature specific to riparian si this paper uses the term riparian si to describe the displacement of fresh groundwater by brackish or saline water from estuarine rivers or streams the interaction between fresh groundwater and an estuarine river with fluctuating salinity and head generates complex mixing processes trefry et al 2007 westbrook et al 2005 density contrasts between fresh groundwater and brackish to saline river water create a saltwater wedge where a mixed convection cell occurs here river water flows into the adjacent aquifer mixes with existing groundwater and the mixed water can then be recirculated back into the river fig 1 linderfelt turner 2001 smith turner 2001 the more saline the river water the larger the recirculation zone beneath the river due to larger buoyancy forces lenkopane et al 2009 like saltwater intrusion at the coast tidal forcing at the river boundary causes groundwater levels to fluctuate with tides which also increases mixing of groundwater and river water widens the freshwater saltwater transition zone due to hydrodynamic dispersion and forms an upper convective recirculation zone adjacent to the riverbank fig 1 lenkopane et al 2009 robinson et al 2007 although vertical flows are known to occur in these groundwater discharge zones sadat noori et al 2021 santos et al 2012 the present study did not specifically investigate vertical groundwater flows riparian si is driven by factors affecting both surface water and groundwater processes such as the river aquifer hydraulic gradient hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneity of riverbed and adjacent aquifer and river salinity lenkopane et al 2009 shalem et al 2015 shalem et al 2019 trefry et al 2007 vandenbohede et al 2008 webster et al 1996 although riparian si is a natural process anthropogenic forces such as land drainage and reclamation groundwater and surface water extraction to meet the growing demands of coastal populations and industries renken et al 2005 zhu et al 2020 riverbed mining lu et al 2007 or dredging parker et al 1955 can increase its severity furthermore riparian si will likely be exacerbated by climate change projections of sea level rise increased frequency and duration of droughts increased frequency and intensity of storms and tides and reduced river flows anderson lockaby 2012 tully et al 2019 a review of the literature indicates that most field methods to characterise riparian si can be categorized into i time series measurements of groundwater and surface water level electrical conductivity and temperature ii geophysical methods cross checked with piezometer data and iii analyses of groundwater and surface water chemistry and other water quality parameters table 2 this review excluded studies on groundwater discharge into estuarine rivers or creeks as these studies focus more on surface water dynamics and investigations instead of the adjacent shallow groundwater processes e g glaser et al 2021 gleeson et al 2013 peterson et al 2019 peterson et al 2010 time series measurements of groundwater and surface water level electrical conductivity or temperature are the most widely used method and provides temporal variation at specific points most studies used time series measurements as complimentary to other analyses and did not analyse and discuss these temporal variations in detail an exception is shalem et al 2019 where the dynamic response of a coastal aquifer adjacent to a bar built estuarine river n b non tidal for most of the year was explored using time series data of groundwater and river level and salinity across a transect perpendicular to the river in contrast the present study monitored a river and groundwater system that were consistently influenced by tides this is important because saltwater intrusion under tidal forcing resulted in pronounced changes in groundwater flow patterns and velocities ataie ashtiani et al 1999 and increased groundwater salinity adjacent to the estuarine river or estuary bank compared to a non tidal setting lenkopane et al 2009 werner lockington 2006 additionally geophysical methods are useful to map the extent and shape of saltwater plumes adjacent to and under rivers at a point in time and to visualize aquifer heterogeneity furthermore groundwater chemistry analyses provide delineation of potential origins of flow as a snapshot in time the transience of si occurring at the ocean boundary has been classified into active and passive depending on the direction of groundwater flow fetter 2001 werner 2016 this study proposes that this is a useful classification for riparian si despite its consideration of a simple two dimensional aquifer as well as the differences between si from the coast and estuarine rivers outlined in table 1 adapted to a riparian setting active si occurs when river water flows in the same direction as groundwater flow and the hydraulic gradient dips toward the aquifer while passive si occurs when river water flows against the direction of groundwater flow and the hydraulic gradient dips toward the river the case of passive active si defined by werner 2016 is not considered here as this study focuses on groundwater conditions directly adjacent to a tidal river and excludes areas further inland where a groundwater mound a specific requirement for the active passive case would be located although studies have assessed river aquifer hydraulic gradients e g shalem et al 2019 and darcy fluxes e g zamora et al 2021 no study has systematically analysed the transience of riparian si based on si classifications to the authors knowledge the analysis of time series field data is therefore required to verify and improve conceptualizations of transient riparian si in aotearoa new zealand where this study is conducted groundwater salinization due to sea level rise has been considered as one of the most urgent areas requiring further research for climate change adaptation ministry for the environment 2020 to the authors knowledge there has been no publication nationally on a field investigation of si from an estuarine river additionally although aotearoa new zealand has an abundance of freshwater supply and was ranked as having one of the highest total renewable freshwater resources per capita among oecd countries oecd 2022 increased groundwater extraction to meet growing demands from aquifers hydraulically connected to estuarine rivers can result in increased si peters et al 2022 furthermore groundwater table rise due to sea level rise is a concern in aotearoa new zealand ministry for the environment 2020 and many coastal areas worldwide bosserelle et al 2022a as drains may be increasingly installed to lower the water table the inadvertent risk of drawing saltwater from estuarine water bodies may also increase this research can therefore serve as an important case study both nationally and internationally to characterize the dynamics of riparian si from which future risks and adaptive measures can be determined this study aimed to document a case of riparian si in the field and expands on the current literature including shalem et al 2019 by examining riparian si dynamics convective recirculation of brackish river water and relating field observations to modelled riparian si phenomena such as fresh groundwater discharge tube and cyclical flows lenkopane et al 2009 linderfelt turner 2001 smith turner 2001 trefry et al 2007 xiao et al 2019 this paper also enhanced current methodologies of studying riparian si by applying density correction to hydraulic head measurements and quantifying freshwater head and horizontal hydraulic gradient uncertainties using error propagation methods post et al 2018 to determine river aquifer flow directions furthermore signal processing techniques which are increasingly applied in hydrogeology such as cross correlation and fourier analysis e g canul macario et al 2020 levanon et al 2017 levanon et al 2013 pacheco castro et al 2021 shalem et al 2019 were employed to analyse the relationship and lag time between the sea estuarine river and groundwater this study can also be useful to other riparian si investigations by providing detailed methods on the post processing analyses and interpretation of standard time series data water level and specific conductance as well as insights on the design of riparian si monitoring programmes 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study site is located in ōtautahi christchurch forthwith ōtautahi on the east coast of te waipounamu the south island of aotearoa new zealand the ancestral home of ngāi tahu and ngāi tūāhuriri who exercise mana whenua indigenous sovereignty hobbs et al 2022 ōtautahi is a coastal low lying city with a flat topography and an elevation of around 20 m above sea level hobbs et al 2022 built on swampland drained by european settlers wilson 1989 the climate is temperate with a median annual precipitation of 618 mm year 1 and a median annual average temperature of 11 12 c macara 2016 the population of ōtautahi is 394 700 stats nz 2020 which relies solely on groundwater for its water supply christchurch city council 2021 the ōtautahi coastal aquifer system was formed by the glaciation interglaciation and sea level fluctuation cycle during the quaternary period resulting in a multi layered confined unconfined aquifer system that extends offshore please refer to figure 23 in begg et al 2015 for a hydrostratigraphic profile showing strata sequence the artesian aquifer layers consist of predominantly fluvial gravel deposited during glacial or low sea level periods separated by lower permeability layers consisting predominantly of fine deposits of sand silt and clay with wood peat with shells sometimes present deposited during interglacial or high sea level periods begg et al 2015 the deepest bore drilled in ōtautahi revealed a total of sixteen separate sequences of high and low permeability strata down to 241 m brown 1998 the dominant groundwater recharge source is seepage from the waimakariri river an alpine fed braided river with highly permeable gravel bed located north of ōtautahi and rainfall upgradient of the city stewart 2012 the gravel aquifers are a highly productive source of freshwater for ōtautahi residents some of which is extracted for large scale agricultural use further inland in the waitaha canterbury plains brown 2001 parts of ōtautahi comprise a discharge zone with an upward hydraulic gradient cox et al 2021 where groundwater resurfaces as springs which provide river base flows stewart et al 2018 and via artesian wells drilled into confined strata the focus of this study is the christchurch formation which is the surficial or water table aquifer of the ōtautahi coastal aquifer system the christchurch formation is up to 56 m deep at the coast gradually thins inland and ends approximately 10 km from the coastline begg et al 2015 it is made of holocene age beach estuarine lagoon dune and coastal swamp deposits of gravel sand silt clay shell and peat that varies spatially brown weeber 1992 white 2007 for example the shallow aquifer is made of predominantly sand along the coast and made of sand silt and peat of drained estuaries around the inside of river meanders and the river mouth areas brown weeber 1992 the spatial distribution of the shallow aquifer material is indicated by the soil map presented in fig 2 e landcare research 2019 where soil type can correlate to the surficial geology and landform prior to large scale drainage environment canterbury et al 2019 at the transect location the soil type on the outside of the river meander true left was described as sandy while the soil type on the inside of the river meander true right was described as silty however average hydraulic conductivity values estimated from slug tests analysed using the hvorslev 1951 method conducted in september 2021 ranged from 15 to 46 m per day across all five bores which categorises the aquifer material as silty sand or clean sand freeze cherry 1979 hence the slug tests showed that the aquifer hydraulic conductivity in both sides of the river are similar this study focuses on si from the estuarine reach of the ōtākaro avon river forthwith ōtākaro into the adjacent christchurch formation aquifer the ōtākaro was a crucial mahinga kai food gathering place for ngāi tūāhuriri te tapuae o rehua university of otago n d waitaha ngāti māmoe and ngāi tahu iwi tribes prior to european colonisation christchurch city council n d the ōtākaro is an urban micro tidal river that receives base flow from the christchurch formation as well as the underlying semi confined riccarton gravel aquifer at the headwater sites further inland cameron 1992 tidal signals propagate from pegasus bay to the ihutai avon heathcote estuary forthwith ihutai and later up the ōtākaro fig 2d with specific time lags macpherson 1978 orchard et al 2020a the comparison of the deepest points between the estuary bed existing in the estuary mouth and the riverbed revealed that the ihutai estuary was approximately 3 to 4 m deeper than the riverbed at the transects in fig 2c measures bind 2013 the maximum seawater encroachment into the ōtākaro under current sea level was modelled at around 5 km upstream of the river mouth reference point fig 2d during a spring tide event and 20 exceedance river flow i e river flow that is exceeded 20 of the time of 2 07 m3s 1 orchard measures 2016 the lower ōtākaro riverbed is generally expected to be less conductive than the aquifer however the authors are not aware of any study that has analysed riverbed sediment deeper than the top 1 2 cm e g bolton ritchie 2015 gadd skyes 2014 the top 2 3 cm of riverbed sediment in the lower ōtākaro at approximately the river logger location in fig 2c has been described as predominantly composed of silt clay and fine sand gadd skyes 2014 the mean river flow at the non tidal reach 14 km upstream of the river mouth reference point in fig 2d was 1 85 m3s 1 from 2018 to 2022 environment canterbury unpublished data median water table level contours from 2016 to 2020 by bosserelle et al 2022b from 265 bores across the city fig 2d showed groundwater mounds on either side of the lower ōtākaro which roughly indicated perpendicular groundwater flow toward the river fig 2d unfortunately no monitoring bores exist on the coastal true left side of the transects to confirm the groundwater flow direction in this sand dune area therefore this study is limited by assuming perpendicular groundwater flow to the river due to insufficient bore infrastructure the transect setup here i e perpendicular to the river is also similar to shalem et al 2019 bosserelle et al 2022b also showed that tidal signal propagation was strongest and quickest in shallow bores along the tidal river compared to those located along the coast e g at the sand spit between the estuary and the ocean this suggests that tidal signals propagate through the estuary up the rivers and into the shallow aquifer most efficiently compared to the christchurch formation unit from the coast or other pathways that may exist additionally locations of brackish shallow groundwater in the christchurch formation have been identified around the inside of the estuarine ōtākaro meander and the sand dune spit located between the ihutai avon heathcote estuary and the ocean highlighted in fig 2d setiawan et al 2022 the lower reaches of the ōtākaro experienced land subsidence following the 2010 11 canterbury earthquake sequence for example bexley the suburb where part of the study site was located experienced an average land subsidence of 0 52 m hughes et al 2015 quigley et al 2016 the land subsidence in the lower reaches of the ōtākaro simulated a local sea level rise effect orchard et al 2020b which increased seawater encroachment further up the river in ōtautahi climate change has been modelled to increase the potential for drought increase mean sea level by 1 2 m by 2110 relative to the baseline of 1985 2005 under worst case emissions scenario increase high tide levels and reduce mean annual low river flows macara et al 2020 more impactful than sea level rise parts of ōtautahi are experiencing a high rate of land subsidence of up to 6 mm year 1 in the vicinity of the study site which are underlain by soft sediments pearson et al 2021 both land subsidence and climate change are likely to increase riparian si vulnerability particularly during summer low flow conditions 2 2 drilling methods two transects comprised of five shallow piezometers were used in this study fig 2 four out of five piezometers were constructed from slotted pvc and were drilled along the ōtākaro tidal reach these piezometers were 32 mm in diameter and were drilled using the lost cone method eijkelkamp n d in february 2020 no soil samples were retrievable as this was not possible using this drilling approach the slotted pvc screens were wrapped in a filter sleeve to avoid sedimentation the remaining shallow piezometer 1 l2 used in the study was part of an existing shallow groundwater monitoring network owned by the christchurch city council it was drilled using the sonic method in june 2016 was capped at the bottom and had a diameter of 50 mm all piezometer screens were in the christchurch formation the five piezometers in this study were part of the shallow groundwater salinity survey of ōtautahi setiawan et al 2022 where piezometers 1 r and 2 r were found to be among the most saline in the survey fig 2d three of the five monitored shallow piezometers 1 r 2 r and 2 l see fig 2c are located on land severely affected by liquefaction following the 2010 11 canterbury earthquake sequence termed the residential red zone the horizontal and vertical positions of well casings measuring points were surveyed using a trimble real time kinematic rtk with a horizontal accuracy of 1 cm and vertical accuracy of 1 5 cm the piezometer depths were measured using a weighted measuring tape the local vertical datum lvd used in this study was lyttelton vertical datum 1937 which sits 0 19 m below mean sea level over 2002 2020 land information new zealand 2021b or 1 24 m above the chart datum land information new zealand 2021c the distance between each piezometer to the river edge was measured using a measuring tape where possible the distance between a piezometer and the river edge that crossed a busy road was measured using arcgis esri 2021 and aerial imagery eagle technology et al 2021 transect 1 located approximately 1 8 km upstream of the ōtākaro river mouth reference point fig 2d was comprised of two wells on the true left of the river 1 l1 and 1 l2 and one well on the true right of the river 1 r transect 2 located approximately 1 3 km upstream of the river mouth was comprised of one well on the true left of the river 2 l and one well on the true right of the river 2 r loggers measuring river level electrical conductivity and temperature were in the river between the two transects approximately 1 6 km upstream of the river mouth although the river loggers were not directly aligned with the transects due to installation difficulties the river logger location between the two transects is considered a valid approximation of river behaviour at the transects 2 3 groundwater and river level temperature electrical conductivity and sea level measurements groundwater and river level temperature and electrical conductivity were measured every 10 min for over five months from 1 january 2021 to 9 june 2021 the monitoring period used was the longest continuous data collected over a sixteen month period as datalogger failures occurred and tampering of equipment was commonly encountered in the urban river large parts of the results and discussion sections focus on summer dry periods january to february 2021 to characterise groundwater response to tides in the absence of rainfall groundwater level temperature and electrical conductivity in the piezometers were measured using a solinst ltc levelogger edge model 3001 m10 except for 1 l2 where an m30 version was installed solinst canada ltd 2020 the loggers were suspended at the piezometer screen using stainless steel wire the manufacturer specified accuracy for the level measurements are 1 5 cm and 0 5 cm for the m30 and the m10 models respectively while the typical clock drift is 1 min year and the electrical conductivity accuracy is 1 at 5 000 80 000 µscm 1 and 2 or 15 µscm 1 whichever is greater for 80 5 000 µscm 1 for both m30 and m10 models the temperature accuracy is 0 05 c for both models manual groundwater level readings were conducted using the solinst tlc 40 m solinst canada ltd 2017 air pressure was recorded using a solinst barologger edge model 3001 solinst canada ltd 2020 for barometric compensation of groundwater level readings with an accuracy of 0 05 kpa equivalent to 0 51 cm of water within approximately 3 km from the piezometer transects river electrical conductivity and temperature were measured using an odyssey conductivity and temperature logger with a calibrated range of 1 000 to 60 000 µs cm 1 dataflow systems ltd n d the manufacturer specified accuracy for the electrical conductivity is 3 or 200 µs cm 1 whichever is greater and the worst case clock drift is 1 min month the logger was tied to a brick and sunk to the bottom of the river at the location shown on the transect map fig 1b river level was measured using a hobo u20l 01 water level logger onset computer corporation 2018 with an accuracy of 1 2 cm water and the clock drift was 1 min month the river level logger was suspended in the river using stainless steel wire inside a pvc tube with holes attached to a waratah hammered into the riverbed by a jetty for ease of access elevation surveys of the waratah before and after the monitoring period showed that it was stable throughout the monitoring period comparison between the internal logger and computer clocks was not possible for both river loggers because there was no functionality for this within both manufacturer s software all data were downloaded using a computer set to new zealand standard time i e without daylight saving adjustment all groundwater river and air pressure loggers were downloaded two times throughout the monitoring period and the internal logger clocks were re set to synchronise with the computer clock at each download the largest difference between the internal clock and computer clock was 67 s for all groundwater and air pressure loggers which did not cause any perceptible difference in the hydraulic head or specific conductance interpretations therefore no clock shift adjustments were made to the dataset sea level records were derived as secondary data from land information new zealand 2021d measured using a ge druck ptx 1830 pressure transducer ge druck n d with an accuracy of 1 2 cm and located approximately 7 5 km from the piezometers at sumner tide gauge location shown in fig 2d data downloaded from the loggers were post processed using pandas mckinney 2010 and visualised using matplotlib hunter 2007 both of which are open source python libraries erroneous data points associated with logger downloads were manually removed and the empty values were populated using 5th order polynomial interpolation in pandas the calculations in the following subsections were conducted subsequently 2 4 conversion to specific conductance and density electrical conductivity increases with temperature by about 2 for every c increase jiao post 2019 miller et al 1988 therefore groundwater electrical conductivity ec was compensated for temperature by conversion into specific conductance sc which is electrical conductivity at a reference temperature here 25 c is used 1 sc ec 1 0 02 t 25 where t is the recorded water temperature in c sc can be used as a proxy for salinity which is common practice jiao post 2019 sc can be converted to total dissolved solids tds by 2 tds k e s c where k e is a conversion factor that depends on the chemical make up of the water sample and 0 68 is commonly used as a first approximation for mixtures of freshwater and seawater jiao post 2019 in this study salt concentration is assumed to be equal to tds salt concentration c ml 3 can be converted to density ρ ml 3 by langevin et al 2008 3 ρ ρ 0 ρ c c c 0 where ρ0 ml 3 is the reference density which is 1 000 kg m 3 ρ c is the approximate change in density over change in salinity which is 0 7 and c0 ml 3 is the reference concentration for density which is 0 kg m 3 the temperature term was removed from the equation because the reference temperature of 25 c was equal to the recorded temperature i e sc at 25 c and therefore the temperature term equated to zero to justify the use of equation 3 river and groundwater samples were analysed for density in the laboratory using a pycnometer these empirical density measurements were compared with density values determined from equation 3 the relationships between density and sc based on empirical measurements and equation 3 had minimal difference and would have negligible effect in freshwater head and flow direction interpretations therefore equation 3 was used for density conversion 2 5 conversion to freshwater head the total groundwater pressure recorded by the pressure transducer p ml 1t 2 was converted to water column height hpt l as rau et al 2019 4 h pt p p b ρ a g where pb is the recorded barometric pressure ml 1t 2 ρa is the average groundwater density over the water column ml 3 g is the gravitational acceleration constant mt 2 which is 9 81 ms 2 the density of water at the sensor location was assumed to be the average density of the water column to estimate the error associated with this assumption the difference between the density reading at the sensor location and the average water column density was calculated both converted from sc the average water column density was determined by measuring sc profiles using solinst ltc leveloggers installed in each well connected to a direct read cable solinst canada ltd 2020 the sc profiles were measured by logging sc readings every meter down the measuring point at two second intervals for a few minutes until just above the well bottom averaged for each depth values before reaching equilibrium were excluded and then converted to density the average water column density was calculated using the methods of post et al 2018 the groundwater level elevation relative to the local vertical datum lyttelton 1937 datum h l was derived by 5 h m p d pt h pt where mp l is the measuring point elevation relative to the local vertical datum and dpt l is the pressure transducer depth from the measuring point to its zero point the h was converted to freshwater head to correctly interpret groundwater flow direction and magnitude post et al 2007 freshwater head hf l is defined as post et al 2018 6 h f ρ a h ρ a ρ f z ρ f where ρf ml 3 is the freshwater density and z l is the elevation of the bottom of the well relative to the local vertical datum 2 6 uncertainty of freshwater heads and horizontal hydraulic gradients the uncertainty of freshwater heads was expressed as the standard deviation of freshwater head σhf this was determined using the freshwater head error propagation method outlined in post et al 2018 which requires inferring the standard deviations of ρ and z the standard deviation of ρ σρ was inferred as 1 kgm 3 as a conservative estimate following post et al 2018 given the difference between average water column density and density measured at the sensor locations were below this shown in the results section the standard deviation of z σz used was 0 015 m considering the rtk survey accuracy the standard deviation of h residuals i e the difference between manual and datalogger measurements of groundwater level σh of individual wells were used shown in the results section the uncertainty of either δhf l the difference between river and groundwater freshwater head and δx l the distance from a piezometer to the closest river edge can be derived using basic error propagation rules given the errors in the measurements of hf and x are random and uncorrelated post et al 2018 7 σ δ σ 1 2 σ 2 2 where σ on the right hand side is the standard deviation of hf or x the standard deviation of x σx were inferred as 1 m due to the estimated change in the river edge from tidal fluctuations the relative error of the horizontal hydraulic gradient δhf δx can be determined as post et al 2018 8 σ i i σ δ h f δ h f 2 σ x δ x 2 where i represents δhf δx for brevity 2 7 cross correlation analysis the cross correlation analysis determines the relationship of two time series as a function of time lag or offset kim et al 2008 this analysis was applied to time series data of sea river and groundwater levels it was not applied to the sc signals as they had irregular waveforms except for river sc cross correlation is a measure of similarity of two time series x and y with their respective units of length n at time i t as a function of time lag k t the cross covariance function cxy k is defined as thomson emery 2014 9 c xy k 1 n k i 1 n k y i y x i k x the cross correlation coefficient function ρxy is defined as thomson emery 2014 10 ρ xy c xy k σ x σ y where σx and σy are the standard deviations of x and y the maximum cross correlation coefficient forthwith r with a range from 0 to 1 denotes the interdependency between the two time series while taking into account the time lag kim et al 2008 the larger the r value the stronger the interdependency between two time series 2 8 discrete fourier transform the discrete fourier transform dft transforms data from a function of time and signal e g head and sc measurements into frequency and power allowing the separation of cyclic drivers in groundwater data such as ocean earth and atmospheric tides and their significance acworth et al 2015 in this study dft was used to separate the influence of tidal signals in groundwater and river time series dft is expressed as e g acworth et al 2015 11 x k n 0 n 1 x n e 2 π kn n where x k is the frequency spectrum of the time series x n with length n here dft was computed using fast fourier transform or fft from the scipy library which is an open source collection of algorithms for scientific computing in python virtanen et al 2020 the fft was applied to a subset of the dataset during a summer dry period in january 2021 the driest month of the year on average national institute of water and atmospheric research 2022 this was because it allowed us to focus on background signals unaffected by rain 3 results 3 1 riparian si dynamics this section presents riparian si dynamics at the two transects using measured data and analysis techniques described in the methods section sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 3 on freshwater head and sc dynamics elaborate on groundwater and river behaviours during a no rainfall period to focus on characterising groundwater response to tides taking the period of 1 to 4 february 2021 as an example which is representative of a summer dry period 3 1 1 freshwater head dynamics sea level at sumner the nearest tide gauge shown in fig 2d ranged from 1 75 m to 1 84 m lvd and averaged at 0 27 m lvd with a standard deviation of 0 61 m throughout the monitoring period i e 1 january to 9 june 2021 time series of sea level river level and river sc in early february 2021 are shown in fig 3 the prevailing tidal regime around aotearoa new zealand including sumner is semidiurnal walters et al 2001 similar to the observations in fig 3 tides change river level with their ebb and flow the river freshwater heads at the monitored location ranged from 0 16 to 1 94 m lvd and averaged at 0 50 m lvd with a standard deviation of 0 42 m throughout the monitoring period the river freshwater head amplitude at the monitored location was approximately 60 of the sea level amplitude the river sc dynamics will be elaborated later in section 3 1 3 freshwater heads at transects 1 and 2 fluctuate with estuarine river heads fig 4 a and fig 5 a the error shades were calculated based on the standard deviation values in table 3 the rise and fall of river and groundwater freshwater head curves were observed to be asymmetric the freshwater head curves were quicker to reach their peaks compared to the troughs in transect 1 on the true left side the freshwater head in the piezometer closer to the river 1 l1 rose above the freshwater head in the piezometer further away from the river 1 l2 during and around high tide although the error bands between the two freshwater heads overlapped fig 4 during and around low tide the freshwater head in 1 l2 also rose above that in 1 l1 the ebb and flow of tides were expected to drive groundwater flow in the adjacent aquifer in both transects the freshwater heads and hydraulic gradient on the true left side of the river were on average greater than that on the true right side fig 6 and table 3 the mean freshwater head at 1 r was equal to that at the river indicating a mean hydraulic gradient of zero additionally the largest mean freshwater head was observed at 2 l amongst the monitored piezometers the freshwater head standard deviations in the piezometers were smaller than in the river fig 6 amongst the piezometers the largest freshwater head standard deviation was observed in 2 r and the smallest in 1 l2 the freshwater head standard deviations in transect 1 were on average smaller than that in transect 2 in addition the freshwater head standard deviation at 1 l1 was larger than at 1 l2 which is further inland 3 1 2 cross correlation based on cross correlation analysis river level peaks lagged sea level peaks by 1 5 h r 0 95 and the river sc peaks lagged river level peaks by 40 min r 0 95 in february 2021 the occurrence of river sc peaks following river level peaks was similarly observed by orchard and measures 2016 in the tidal reach of the ōtākaro unpublished raw data the cross correlation analysis also showed that the maximum freshwater head in all piezometers generally occurred within 30 min after the maximum freshwater head in the river table 4 the piezometer with the shortest lag time was 1 l1 which was also located closest to the river the piezometer with the longest lag time was 1 l2 located inland of 1 l1 the r values ranged from 0 86 to 0 98 across all piezometers 3 1 3 sc dynamics river sc fluctuated with the ebb and flow of tides fig 3 at the river logger location the river changed from fresh to saline within a tidal cycle throughout the monitoring period river sc ranged from 791 µscm 1 1 4 seawater to 42 032 µscm 1 76 seawater with an average of 12 077 µscm 1 and standard deviation of 11 249 µscm 1 fig 6 groundwater sc at the piezometers also fluctuated with the ebb and flow of the estuarine river fig 4 and fig 5 except 2 l during the period shown elaborated further below groundwater sc on the true right side of the river is on average approximately 10 times more saline than that on the true left side of the river fig 6 the sc at 2 l was consistently fresh throughout the monitoring period and at times did not fluctuate with tides such as during the monitoring period shown in fig 5 while 2 l was the freshest bore 2 r on the opposite side of the river was the most saline fig 6 the average sc at 2 r was 17 132 µscm 1 31 seawater which was nearly 34 times greater than the average sc on the opposite side of the river at 2 l 508 µscm 1 fresh water in the time series shown in figs 4 and 5 the sc fluctuation in response to the tidal saltwater pulse was greatest at 2 r compared to the other bores the sc fluctuation at 1 r was smaller compared to 1 l1 and 1 l2 even though 1 r was on average eight times more saline than 1 l1 and seven times more saline than 1 l2 meanwhile groundwater sc and its amplitude at 1 l2 was consistently greater at 1 l1 during dry periods even though 1 l2 is further inland compared to 1 l1 however 1 l2 is approximately 1 6 m deeper compared to 1 l1 table 3 and fig 6 attempts to run cross correlation between river and groundwater sc resulted in unreliable time lag results due to the irregular wave forms encountered in the sc datasets consequently the time lag between groundwater and river sc peaks on 1 february 2021 was analysed using manual calculations table 5 groundwater sc peaks at 1 l1 located 5 m from the river had a time lag of 8 h 50 min following river sc peaks in contrast groundwater sc peaks at 1 l2 located further away at 23 m from the river had a smaller time lag following the river sc peaks of 1 h 50 min there was no observable groundwater sc peak at 2 l during the period analysed piezometers on the true right side of the river had larger lag times at 10 h 40 min 1 r and 12 h 2 r compared to 1 l2 on the true left side at a similar distance from the river 3 1 4 horizontal river aquifer hydraulic gradient hydraulic gradient the driving force of groundwater flow in the direction of maximum decreasing total head cheremisinoff 1997 fluctuated from positive to negative values with tides across all piezometers fig 4c and fig 5c generally during and around high tide the freshwater head at the river rose above that in the adjacent aquifer the hydraulic gradient dipped towards the aquifer and the direction of flow was from the river to the aquifer i e i 0 indicating river water infiltration meanwhile during and around ebb tide the river freshwater head declined and the reverse hydraulic gradient occurred whereby the freshwater heads in the adjacent aquifer were larger than in the river here the direction of flow was from the aquifer to the river i e i 0 indicating groundwater discharge the piezometers spent more time in positive compared to negative hydraulic gradient during the observation period shown in figs 4 and 5 like the freshwater head curves the hydraulic gradient curves were also asymmetric more time was needed to reach maximum hydraulic gradient i e maximum groundwater discharge compared to minimum hydraulic gradient i e maximum river water infiltration this time difference between infiltration and discharge has also been observed in the seawater recirculation process due to tidal pumping in unconfined beach aquifer settings whereby seawater infiltrated quicker during high tide and was slower to discharge during low tide resulting in higher time averaged water table levels compared to sea levels thus groundwater flow was driven towards the ocean santos et al 2012 in transect 1 the hydraulic gradient was steepest at 1 l1 located closest to the river fig 4c and table 3 in transect 2 negative hydraulic gradients at 2 l and 2 r indicated similar ranges but the positive hydraulic gradients at 2 l rose approximately twice as large than 2 r at their peaks fig 5c on average 1 r had the lowest hydraulic gradient while 2 l on the other hand had the highest hydraulic gradient throughout the monitoring period table 3 3 1 5 dft dft alters data from a function of time and signal into frequency and power extracting individual cyclic drivers within river and groundwater time series e g ocean earth and atmospheric tides this research focuses on ocean tide signals the stronger a periodic signal within a time series the greater its amplitude or prominence at this frequency following dft therefore prominent frequencies are strong cyclical signals occurring within the time series lunar and solar gravitational forces acting on the earth and the rotation of the earth cause the periodic rise and fall of ocean tides merritt 2004 time series data of sea level river and groundwater heads and sc in january 2021 were transformed into frequency domains using dft fig 7 the dft of sea level time series at sumner beach tide gauge location shown in fig 2a demonstrated that the most prominent frequency occurred at 1 936 cycles per day table 6 and fig 7a the dominant tidal constituent at the ihutai estuary mouth is the lunar semidiurnal or m2 walters et al 2001 which occur every 12 4 h or at a frequency of 1 932 cycles per day merritt 2004 and approximately coincides with the prominent energy peak of 1 936 cycles per day at the local tide gauge meanwhile the dft of river heads and sc fig 7b and c as well as groundwater heads and sc e g at 2 r in fig 7d and e showed the most prominent frequency to be occurring at 1 935 cycles per day table 6 the frequency domains of the remaining piezometers are shown in figure s1 within the supplementary materials the slight difference between the m2 tidal signal occurring at 1 932 cycles per day and the prominent frequency in the sea level of 1 936 cycles per day as well as in the river and groundwater of 1 935 cycles per day could be due to the short period of the analysed record i e one month and the subsequent blending of various tidal constituents the amplitudes of tidal signals attenuated from the sea up the river and further inland within the aquifer table 6 however the sc amplitude was larger in 1 l2 than 1 l1 even though 1 l2 is located further inland the most saline well 2 r showed the strongest tidal signal in its freshwater head and sc the freshest well 2 l also showed comparatively strong tidal signals in its freshwater head but the weakest tidal signal in its sc the sc amplitude was smaller at 1 r compared to 1 l1 and 1 l2 even though 1 r was more saline than 1 l1 and 1 l2 4 discussion groundwater sc peaks were observed to occur hours after river sc peaks or shortly prior to the next river sc peak as shown in fig 4b fig 5b and table 5 riparian si observed here is part of a cyclic system with complex flow processes and there can naturally be different lags in the aquifer response to the salinity stressor at a timescale that is hard to predict trefry et al 2007 three dimensional modelling of a seasonally saline river and the adjacent aquifer by trefry et al 2007 observed that saline wedge expansion in the aquifer counter intuitively occurred during low river salinity periods they found that the dominant stressor e g increase in river salinity and its effect e g the expansion of saline wedge can vary out of phase which may be improbable in steady systems but natural in cyclical systems such as aquifers adjacent to seasonally saline surface water bodies piezometer 1 l1 was observed to be consistently fresher than 1 l2 during dry periods even though 1 l1 is located closer to the estuarine river fig 4 piezometer 1 l1 is shallower than 1 l2 by nearly 1 6 m and hence the screen of 1 l1 may not be intercepting the denser brackish water which will sink deeper into the aquifer as observed previously by shalem et al 2019 another possible explanation is that the screen of 1 l1 is intercepting a zone of fresh groundwater discharging back into the river this phenomenon has been observed in a beach ocean setting by robinson et al 2007 who termed it the freshwater discharge tube lenkopane et al 2009 and xiao et al 2019 showed in their model of si from a partially penetrating estuary with tidally varying salinity that this freshwater discharge tube also likely exists in tidal estuarine settings they showed that there are two mixed recirculation zones one beneath the estuary bed and one adjacent to the estuary bank fig 1 sandwiched between these two circulation zones is a zone where fresh groundwater originating from further inland was funnelled and discharged back into the estuary xiao et al 2019 showed that the fresh groundwater tube was present at low tides and rising mid tides but disappeared at high tides and falling mid tides because of surface water infiltration the fresher groundwater measured at 1 l1 compared to 1 l2 may be hypothesized to exist due to a freshwater discharge tube in westbrook et al 2005 a cross sectional electrical conductivity map of a shallow groundwater system adjacent to an estuarine river also showed a funnelling of fresh groundwater discharge between an upper saline brackish plume and a saltwater wedge at the aquifer bottom additionally during periods when the gradient between the river and groundwater freshwater head indicated flow from the river to the aquifer i e i 0 the sc at 1 l1 was observed to decline unlike observations at other piezometers which is contrary to expectations while this may be related to the presence of a freshwater discharge tube it may also be due to processes that are not yet able to be explained in this research in response to an oceanic tidal fluctuation river level peak was observed to occur first at 1 5 h lag followed by groundwater level peak at approximately 2 h lag across all bores river sc peak at 2 2 h lag and lastly groundwater sc peak at 4 5 to 14 7 h lag during a dry period on 1 february 2021 an exception was piezometer 2 l where no groundwater sc peak was observed the analysis of tide induced groundwater level and salinity fluctuations in a coastal unconfined aquifer also observed that the time lag between sea level and groundwater level fluctuations was smaller than the time lag between sea level and groundwater salinity fluctuations at the same location within the freshwater saltwater interface levanon et al 2017 additionally the cross correlation analysis showed very strong relationships between river and groundwater freshwater heads r values ranged from 0 86 to 0 98 throughout the monitoring period these r values are comparable to kim et al 2008 who analysed groundwater electrical conductivity time series data in relation to tides in a coastal si setting interestingly piezometer 1 l2 located further from the river 23 m from the riverbank experienced sc peaks earlier compared to 1 l1 located closer to the river 5 m from the riverbank however piezometer 1 l2 is 1 6 m deeper than 1 l1 fig 6 as previously mentioned based on the conceptual model in fig 1 lenkopane et al 2009 smith turner 2001 saltwater enters predominantly from the bottom of the river and flows toward the bottom of the aquifer and outside of the wedge before discharging back into the riverbank therefore in this case the deeper piezometer further away from the river may be hypothesised to receive saltwater flow before the piezometer closer to the river alternatively a preferential saltwater flow path from the river toward 1 l2 may be hypothesised to exist the fourier analysis confirmed the tidal nature of the ōtākaro and the adjacent groundwater at the monitored transects the prominent m2 lunar semi diurnal signal occurring every 12 4 h or 1 935 cycles per day was detected in the freshwater heads and sc at the river and piezometers with varying amplitudes or strengths at each location table 6 and fig 7 the most saline bore 2 r had the largest sc and freshwater head amplitudes among all the monitored bores although 2 l was the freshest bore with the smallest sc amplitude its freshwater head was strongly tidal as shown by its relatively large amplitude while tide induced groundwater level fluctuations have crucial implications for determining saltwater intrusion and groundwater discharge at the estuarine river boundary carey et al 2009 the degree of tidal influence in shallow groundwater level fluctuations at any given location does not indicate si tide induced groundwater level fluctuations can be detected significantly further inland than the extent of si depending on aquifer hydraulic properties jiao post 2019 tidally driven changes in river aquifer hydraulic gradients and river sc resulted in two observed processes with various time delays si and saltwater retreat the si process is characterised by the increase in groundwater sc and the landward movement of the freshwater saltwater interface with varying time lags relative to the increase in river sc here this study reflects on the classifications of active and passive si fetter 2001 werner 2016 in a riparian setting the conceptualization that follows assumes an almost immediate response from groundwater sc to changes in river aquifer hydraulic gradient and river sc which may be unlikely to occur in the field during low tide the freshwater head at the river was lower than in the aquifer as the incoming tide travelled upstream within the river the river freshwater head increased followed by the increase in river sc passive si would occur as the river head and sc were rising while the freshwater head at the aquifer was larger than in the river here groundwater discharge was present inferred from i 0 and flowing against the direction of river water into the aquifer active si would occur as the river freshwater head and sc continued to rise and the freshwater head at the river rose higher than that at the aquifer indicating the active flow of river water into the aquifer here both groundwater and river water flowed landward at high tide the river freshwater head was larger than in the aquifer as river freshwater head and sc further lowered during the ebbing tide the freshwater head at the aquifer became higher than in the river and groundwater discharge occurred inferred from i 0 and saltwater retreat i e the decrease in groundwater sc may occur tidally driven groundwater fluxes have been similarly observed in studies focused on submarine groundwater discharge into tidal creeks glaser et al 2021 gleeson et al 2013 at the local scale the ōtākaro has been classified as a gaining river throughout its reach i e constant presence of groundwater discharge yang et al 2019 but this study shows that parts of the tidal reach consistently change between gaining and losing although this study did not measure vertical flows the observations of freshwater head hydraulic gradient and sc showed that tidal pumping induced saltwater flow from the river into the aquifer during high tide but the salt was not completely returned during low tide i e the groundwater did not freshen to the same degree as the river the salt was then recirculated back in the aquifer during and around the subsequent high tide this tidal pumping effect was also revealed in the numerical modelling experiments of werner and lockington 2006 the recirculation of salt laden groundwater may indicate a mixed convective recirculation cell whereby the river water that flows into the aquifer mixes with the existing groundwater and discharged back into the river fig 1 linderfelt turner 2001 smith turner 2001 freshwater heads in the aquifer were on average greater than in the river fig 6 except for 1 r si and saltwater retreat occurred in a cyclical pattern fig 4 and fig 5 unless disrupted by recharge events or anthropogenic activities the percentage of time when the hydraulic gradient sloped towards the river i 0 versus towards the aquifer i 0 was analysed and compared to the percentage of time when the river sc was greater than groundwater sc and vice versa fig 8 generally groundwater sc became greater than river sc during low tide and the reverse occurred during high tide an exception was 2 l which most of the time had positive hydraulic gradients and was consistently fresher than the river during the observation period the wells on the true left side of the river more often had positive hydraulic gradients compared to those on the true right side and they were fresher than the river most of the time fig 8 except for 2 l as mentioned in contrast the wells on the true right side were more saline than the river most of the time and had negative hydraulic gradients for a higher percentage of time than wells on the true left side these results suggest that trends in the gradient between river and groundwater freshwater head is an important driver of groundwater salinity in shallow aquifers adjacent to estuarine rivers the transects in the present study were ideal for observing hydraulic gradient dynamics because the estimated hydraulic conductivities were similar across the sites and hence the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer and river or i became the dominant factor controlling the flux of river water into the aquifer or the occurrence of riparian si aquifer hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneity are crucial factors that influence riparian si the case study site of shalem et al 2019 and shalem et al 2015 by contrast to the current study had a marked difference in aquifer hydraulic conductivity between the silty and sand units at opposite sides of the river shalem et al 2019 found permeable sand lenses within the silty unit which created preferential flow paths for riparian si additionally they found higher salinity groundwater in the silty aquifer compared to the river water and concluded that past si events were better preserved in low permeability units as saltwater becomes entrapped within them furthermore vandenbohede et al 2008 found a semi pervious barrier within a dune aquifer system that impeded downward si from a tidal inlet the present study focused on tidally influenced river aquifer hydraulic gradient as a driving force for riparian si and aquifer heterogeneity was not investigated in addition to river aquifer hydraulic gradient and aquifer hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneity river morphology including degree of bank curvature and slope can influence riparian si as it is one of the driving factors for groundwater discharge into the river linderfelt turner 2001 smith turner 2001 linderfelt and turner 2001 observed that zones of groundwater discharge and low groundwater salinity were focussed on the outside of river meanders while the inside of river meanders were areas of low groundwater discharge sufficient for riparian si evident from the high groundwater salinity measurements zamora et al 2021 similarly observed areas of high electrical resistivity or low conductivity with evidence of groundwater discharge and upward groundwater flux along a cut bank area i e outside of a river meander in contrast a less electrically resistive zone or higher conductivity was found within the shallow part of the inner meander bank and at the river channel centre the outside of river meanders laterally cut deeper into the aquifer and thus captures a greater proportion of groundwater flow where steeper hydraulic gradients were observed compared to the inside of meanders jiao post 2019 linderfelt turner 2001 in this study lower salinity groundwater steeper hydraulic gradients and higher groundwater discharge to the river inferred from hydraulic gradients were also observed on the outside of the river meander true left side compared to the inside of the meander true right side river channel depth and bathymetry can also influence river salinity and riparian si the larger the cross sectional area of the river the greater the distance that saltwater can move upstream a rise in the river bottom blocks the saltwater wedge from penetrating further inland while an increase in river depth for example due to dredging or natural erosion increases the tidal range upstream and the tidal volume tuin 1991 for example extensive sand mining from the lower pearl river in china combined with reduced sediment load to the sea caused rapid channel incision i e increase in channel depth causing the longest lasting seawater encroachment occurrence in over 40 years and water supply issues in the surrounding cities lu et al 2007 piezometer 1 r was on average fresher than 2 r fig 6 even though 1 r experienced more negative hydraulic gradients than 2 r fig 8 which was initially unexpected upon further investigation the deepest point of the interpolated ōtākaro bathymetry in transect 2 was approximately 1 m deeper than transect 1 which may have contributed to the higher salinity in 2 r compared to 1 r as deeper river channels have been observed to cause greater si shallow groundwater salinity controls the type of vegetation that can grow holt et al 2017 wilson et al 2015 the presence of brackish shallow groundwater at the true right side of the river was also indicated by the abundance of saltmarsh plants such as glasswort salicornia quinqueflora and buck s horn plantain plantago coronopus the numerous dead trees as well as the large patches of bare soil with white crusts that may indicate saline soils daliakopoulos et al 2016 which may not be obvious to the hydrogeologist but would be to the ecologist or soil scientist fig 9 the post earthquake land subsidence of the ōtākaro river mouth area including bexley induced a local relative sea level rise orchard et al 2020b which may have increased the extent of riparian si and brought the brackish water table closer to ground surface these land subsidence effects would increase the groundwater sc adjacent to the river and the potential for capillary rise and increased evapotranspiration resulting in increased soil salinity greene et al 2016 4 1 limitations and recommendations for future work this study did not consider vertical flows due to a lack of piezometer infrastructure even though vertical flows are likely important in aquifers directly adjacent to estuarine water bodies lenkopane et al 2009 werner lockington 2006 xiao et al 2019 additionally this study assumed groundwater flow perpendicular to the river and did not consider other directions of lateral flow as there was insufficient bore infrastructure to implement a flow network horizontal fluxes were not quantified here as they were expected to only constitute a component of total flux it was not justifiable to solely focus on horizontal flux while ignoring vertical flux furthermore the time lags of groundwater sc peaks relative to river sc peaks were quantified manually instead of using signal processing techniques such as cross correlation due to the irregular wave forms of groundwater sc additional work may be needed to statistically quantify groundwater sc lags over time we recommend implementing a flow network and analysing lateral groundwater direction and fluxes over time e g over tidal cycles in sadat noori et al 2021 we also recommend installing nested piezometers in the aquifer adjacent to the estuarine river to monitor vertical fluxes and saltwater recirculation additionally the installation of in stream piezometers would enable the monitoring of vertical fluxes and provide insights on saltwater recirculation processes underneath the river however these recommendations may be technically challenging to apply particularly in urban and built environments future research could examine riparian si dynamics in the presence of recharge or with added stressors such as pumping and land drainage other field methods such as time lapse geophysical investigations can further help delineate the shape and extent of the freshwater saltwater interface and saltwater recirculation zones under si and saltwater retreat conditions 5 conclusions a field observation of riparian si was documented in the low lying coastal city of ōtautahi christchurch aotearoa new zealand across two transects of piezometers with similar hydraulic conductivities using time series measurements of groundwater and river freshwater head specific conductance and hydraulic gradient the uncertainties associated with the freshwater head and hydraulic head measurements were estimated using error propagation methods tidally driven changes in river aquifer hydraulic gradients and river sc resulted in the alternation of si increase in groundwater sc and saltwater retreat decrease in groundwater sc with various time delays in response to sea level fluctuation river level at the monitored site was observed to peak after around 1 5 h followed by groundwater level after approximately 2 h across all bores river sc after 2 2 h and finally groundwater sc after 4 5 to 14 7 h varies across all bores during a dry period on 1 february 2021 cross correlation analysis of river and groundwater freshwater heads at the piezometers showed very strong relationships r of 0 86 0 98 with time lags of 19 to 29 min throughout the monitoring period dft of freshwater head and sc in the river and adjacent groundwater confirmed the prominence of the m2 tidal signal with the most saline bore showing the greatest m2 amplitudes in both freshwater head and sc analyses river aquifer hydraulic gradient trends were observed to be an important driver of groundwater salinity in shallow aquifers adjacent to estuarine rivers the percentage of time that a piezometer experienced positive hydraulic gradients i e groundwater river freshwater head was related to the percentage of time that a piezometer was fresher than the river steeper river aquifer hydraulic gradients and fresher groundwater were found on the outside of the river meander compared to the inside of the river meander a phenomenon which has been previously observed e g linderfelt turner 2001 zamora et al 2021 the abundance of saltmarsh plants and crusty soils on the inside of the river meander also confirm the presence of brackish shallow groundwater additionally the roles of other important riparian si drivers in the observed system such as aquifer hydraulic conductivity and heterogeneity as well as river morphology and depth were discussed although positive hydraulic gradients occurred most of the time in the monitored bores alarming rates of land subsidence and future climate change conditions of sea level rise increased drought and decreased river flows may result in increased riparian si riparian si observations and groundwater sc lags that may seem counter intuitive were hypothesized to be driven by cyclic flow processes and the presence of a fresh groundwater discharge zone for example a piezometer that is closer to the river was observed to be consistently fresher with a slower sc response than a piezometer that is 1 6 m deeper and located 18 m further away perpendicularly from the river further research into these

2512,water use efficiency wue determined by water carbon coupling process is important to evaluate the relationship between crop growth and water consumption aiming to provide a novel wue dynamic evaluating method at field scale we developed a crop wue model based on stomata which coupled the processes of crop growth and farmland water cycle in previous work we developed a stomatal conductance model in which crop stomatal conductance could be described by its relationship to meteorological factors soil water and salinity in this study we coupled crop transpiration and photosynthesis based on stomata furthermore the model described the daily crop growth and hydrological processes as a result the developed model could simulate the dynamic changes of crop canopy evapotranspiration et canopy photosynthesis dry matter accumulation and assimilation distribution soil water movement soil salt transport and wue of farmland ecosystems on a daily scale three years field experimental data were used to calibrate the developed model the results showed that the model could simulate the variation of agricultural hydrology processes properly in sunflower field on the daily scale with determination coefficient r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of et transpiration and wue all close to 0 60 r2 and nse of net ecosystem productivity above 0 74 and 0 68 respectively and the coupling model had a good performance in simulating the dynamic change process of soil moisture and salt with the r2 and nse above 0 71 and 0 61 respectively sensitivity analysis of model parameters showed that the selection of the extinction coefficient had a great influence on the accuracy of the model and the accurate description of soil resistance parameters played a crucial role in the accurate quantification of et the developed field wue model can provide novel method to evaluate daily hydrological processes agricultural productivity and wue dynamics keywords farmland stomata transpiration photosynthesis water use efficiency coupling model data availability the raw processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also forms part of an ongoing study 1 introduction water use efficiency wue is an important parameter for evaluating ecosystem water and carbon cycle ito and inatomi 2012 li et al 2021 unland et al 1996 wue of farmland ecosystem depends on the farmland evapotranspiration and co2 fixation by crops abraha et al 2016 wagle et al 2016 evapotranspiration et is an important part of the farmland water cycle and co2 fixation mainly comes from the crop growth process formed by crop photosynthesis furthermore canopy conductance gc is a key variable that couples crop photosynthesis and transpiration leuning et al 1998 louarn et al 2005 gc depends on meteorological conditions soil water and salinity conditions in the root zone and growth stage of crops dekker et al 2001 rajaona et al 2012 xu et al 2020 at the same time et of canopy directly drives the process of farmland water cycle and changes the soil moisture in the root zone the absorption of co2 determines the growth status of crops and the accumulation of dry matter therefore there is a strong coupling effect between crop growth and farmland water cycle fig 1 accurately quantifying the water carbon coupling process of farmland ecosystems is the basis for evaluating the wue of farmland ecosystems at the farmland scale lots of models combine crop growth processes with field water cycle processes to evaluate farmland water productivity some models realize the coupling between these two processes based on the water balance in the root zone and the water stress on crop growth such as the rzwqm model hanson et al 1998 descripted farmland water cycle process based on physical process of soil hydrodynamics and et calculated by s w model and coupled the dssat crop model which used soil moisture as a factor to stress the rate of crop development and the model utilized the extinction coefficient c associated with et to describe the net photosynthetic rate for coupling transpiration and photosynthesis rzwqm has obvious advantages in simulating water and nutrient cycling in farmland however the large amount of climate soil and crop characteristics data required for model increase the difficulty of model application the swap model van dam jos et al 2008 coupled the world food studies wofost crop growth model with the soil hydrodynamic process the model derived et based on potential evapotranspiration and water salinity stress to crop and derived co2 assimilation rate of crop based on the absorbed radiation and the photosynthesis light response curve with assuming constant ratio of potential to actual rates of transpiration and photosynthesis however the difficulty of determining photosynthetic parameters also affects the application of the model and the aquacrop vanuytrecht et al 2014 model coupled the crop growth model driven by the soil moisture transport process which used the normalized biomass water productivity to couple plant transpiration and accumulated biomass the aquacrop model has the advantages of fewer input parameters wide application range simple interface and strong intuitiveness however it lacks the crop physiology submodule and water nutrient interaction module therefore the applicability of aquacrop model under the conditions of strong water salt stress and temperature stress is limited araya et al 2010 salemi et al 2011 jia et al 2011 coupled wofost model and a distributed hydrological model describing the water and energy transfer processes wep l to analyzed climate change impact on crop yield shi et al 2021 established a coupled crop growth and soil water transport model through numerical simulation which drove crop growth by accumulated temperature and used plant water deficit index to estimate et and based on the developed model they quantified relationship between plant water deficit index and the wue however these models did not adequately consider the coupling relationship between photosynthesis and transpiration some models further describe the interaction between photosynthesis and transpiration based on stomata in order to more accurately describe farmland hydrological processes from physiological level the photosynthesis transpiration coupling models based on stomata can be divided into two categories one is to calculate the photosynthetic rate through photosynthesis model with biochemical process collatz et al 1992 farquhar et al 1980 inversely obtain stomatal conductance through the ball berry model ball et al 1987 and then calculate the transpiration rate according to the evapotranspiration model monteith 1965 penman 1948 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the other one is to estimate the stomatal conductance directly through a model such as jarvis model jarvis 1976 and calculate the photosynthetic rate and the transpiration rate based on the energy balance the diffusion of water vapor and co2 and the law of thermal conductivity of air yu et al 2001 established a coupled photosynthesis transpiration model and a wue model smptsb based on stomatal behavior which was based on the principle of electrical analogy the smptsb model avoids the difficulty of determining the physiological parameters and only employs environmental variables although this model is easier for practical use it ignores the effect of soil moisture hoof et al 2011 combined the crop growth dynamics simulation with the joint uk land environment simulator jules and developed the jules sucros model in the model the exchange of vapor and co2 between plants and the atmosphere were regulated by stomatal resistance to realize the coupling between carbon water and energy fluxes lei et al 2011 constructed a field scale ecohydrological model help c which coupled the crop growth model with the simple biosphere model version 2 sib2 and then combined the distributed hydrological model with help c to simulated water and carbon cycle processes in irrigation areas duan 2020 stablished a crop growth model based on photosynthesis transpiration processes using ball berry model ball et al 1987 and further coupled spac hydrothermal transport model to realize the coupling of crop growth and water cycle processes the ball berry model has the advantages of closer connection between photosynthesis and stomata however the coupling calculation is more complicated which need to iterate photosynthetic stomatal conductance and energy balance model simultaneously wang and leuning 1998 existing farmland hydrological process models still rarely describe the coupling of crop transpiration and photosynthesis centered on stomata and the interaction between soil water salt conditions and crop physiological processes is not fully considered furthermore most models only consider salt stress as a function affecting yield but seldom consider its effect on physiological processes thus the specific objectives of this paper were to 1 develop a wue model coupling crop growth and farmland water cycle processes based on the response of stomata to soil water salt within different growth stages 2 calibrate and verify parameters of model and evaluate model applicability using field data from 2019 to 2021 3 determine parameters sensitivity to output variables of model 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the wue model 2 1 1 model framework the frame of model is illustrated in fig 2 based on the bulk stomatal resistances to water vapor r s c and co2 r sc of canopy the coupling relationship between daily canopy et and photosynthesis was described furthermore the bulk stomatal resistances were determined by environment factors including meteorology soil water salt content of root zone and growth stage of crop the daily net ecosystem productivity nep formed by photosynthesis drove the process of crop growth and dominated the accumulation of dry matter including the formation of leaf area index lai the dynamic movement processes of daily soil water and salt were described by the soil hydrological process model in which et computed with crop transpiration by stomatal resistance and soil evaporation irrigation i precipitation p farmland et soil water movement and exchanges with groundwater constituted the water cycle process of farmland ecosystem the formation of farmland ecosystem wue nep et was described by the coupled crop growth and farmland water cycle processes the detailed descriptions of the model can be found in following sections 2 1 2 stomatal resistance of the canopy bulk stomatal resistance of the canopy r s c s m is the reciprocal of gc which is the most critical resistance parameter for the farmland ecosystem it represents the total resistance of all vegetation stomata to water vapor flux in the canopy and is a comprehensive reflection of the physiological state of the plant to indicate response of r s c to environmental factors in salinity land we developed an improved jarvis stomatal conductance model considering the effect of salinity to estimate r s

for sunflower field due to the difference in relative molecular mass of co2 and h2o there is a coefficient conversion relationship between resistance of stomata to co2 r sc and r s c 2 r sc 1 37 r s c based on r s c and r sc we described the coupling relationship between canopy transpiration and photosynthesis 2 1 3 evapotranspiration usually the soil evaporation e of farmland could not be ignored

water and salt transport model to simulate soil water and salt transport processes of farmland we divided the soil profile into five soil layers of 0 10 10 30 30 50 50 70 and 70 90 cm according to the change of soil texture and the buried depth of the sensors the water exchange between soil water and groundwater and the transport of soil water and salinity between soil layers were simulated farmland soil moisture is mainly replenished by irrigation i precipitation p and capillary rise cr in groundwater and is dissipated into atmosphere through plant transpiration t and soil evaporation e salt enters the farmland soil mainly through irrigation and migrates upward through soil evaporation and transport with soil water the soil moisture content in the transition zone was assumed to be constant in this study due to the experimental field was relatively flat the lateral leakage and replenishment of water were not considered only considering the one dimensional vertical movement of water in the farmland the dynamic change of swc in each soil layer was simulated with 1 day as the time step since the soil water storage was relatively abundant during the growth period it could be considered that the gravity was greater than the substrate suction and only the infiltration process was considered while the redistribution process of water in the soil is ignored assuming that the soil evaporation was only provided by the 0 30 cm soil layer according to the measured swc the proportion of the water content of each soil layer consumed by plant transpiration at each growth stage were adjusted 50 δ z 1 d θ 1 dt p i e d 1 2 a 1 t cr 1 51 δ z i d θ i dt d i 1 i d i i 1 a i t cr i 52 δ z n d θ n dt d n 1 n d n a n t cr n where i represents the soil layer number θ i is the

using the functional functions provided by the aquacrop model vanuytrecht et al 2014 e and t were calculated by evapotranspiration model salt enters the soil from irrigation water and through capillary rise in groundwater assuming negligible salt content from rainfall at the same time salt migrates upward with crop transpiration accumulates in the surface layer with soil evaporation and is discharged from the soil with the leakage of soil water the simulation of the ec value of each soil layer was carried out using the salt balance module in the aquacrop model vanuytrecht et al 2014 the upper boundary of the farmland water and salt transport model is the farmland evapotranspiration boundary and the lower boundary is the groundwater boundary 2 1 6 coupling of crop growth and soil water salt transport process with the meteorological conditions as input variable the soil water and salt conditions on the first day of growth period as the initial value and 1 day as the time step the processes of crop growth and farmland water salt transport were coupled with the stomatal resistance calculated by meteorological factors soil water salt conditions and lai the daily e t and nep were obtained e and t affected the migration process of soil water and salt and the accumulation of dry matter formed by nep drove the development of lai swc soil ec and lai calculated from the model of the previous day were used as input variables of the second day to realize coupling on the daily scale the total day length of the growth period was used as the judgment condition to end the cycle the dynamic changes of daily et t nep lai wue soil water and salinity during the whole growth period were output the coupling calculation process of the model is shown in fig 3 2 2 field observation experiment 2 2 1 experiment site description the monitoring experiment of crop growth and water cycle process was carried out at a sunflower field 40 43 n 107 16 e 1 038 m from june to september of 2019 2021 in a typical arid and semi arid irrigated agricultural area hetao irrigation area in inner mongolia in the northwest of china the annual average temperature was 6 1 c and sunshine hours were 3100 3200 h per year the average annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were 180 and 2225 mm respectively luan et al 2018 in order to meet crop water requirement and maintain local agricultural development about 5 billion m3 of water is diverted from the yellow river average salinity of 0 05 per year the primary irrigation method was surface flood system sun et al 2013 soil secondary salinity is the main limitation of agricultural production the physical properties and ec of soil at different depths in the experimental site are shown in table 1 the soil in the 0 90 cm soil layer of the sunflower test field is mainly loam with slightly higher sand content of 0 30 cm the soil below 30 cm is silt loam and the soil texture is relatively uniform the field capacity θfc of 1 m soil layer of sunflower farmland varies from 0 30 to 0 36 m3 m 3 the saturated water content θsat is between 0 40 and 0 47 m3 m 3 and the average dry bulk density γ d is 1 62 g cm 3 the average ec of 1 m soil layer of sunflower farmland is 2 59 ds m 1 the salinity is 0 23 based on the 30 cm soil cultivation layer and the experimental field is moderately saline and alkaline soil the planted sunflower variety is edible seed sunflower yg 361 which was sown at the end of may emerged in mid to early june and matured at the end of september the whole growth period was about 120 days during the growth period there was only one irrigation july 9 in 2019 july 10 in 2020 and july 10 in 2021 and the irrigation quota was about 100 mm by means of border irrigation the planting density of sunflower field was 2 6 m2 plant 1 2 2 2 field measurements a water and carbon flux tower were established in an open sunflower field to collect data to calibrate the developed model fig 4 the field enclosed by the solid line was the eddy covariance system monitoring site the total area of sunflower was more than 10 ha the distance between the source area with 90 contribution rate of measurement results and the observation site is about 116 2 m in average during the entire monitoring period and the distance between the point with the largest contribution rate and the observation site is about 18 96 m kljun et al 2002 kormann and meixner 2001 the length of the field on the main wind and wave area was about 250 m which satisfied the measurement requirements at the beginning of the observation the installment height of eddy covariance system was 2 5 m when crop canopy height increased to 1 5 m the observation height was adjusted to 3 5 m the energy closure calculated by energy balance ratio in 2019 2021 were 0 75 0 81 and 0 83 which showed that the fluxes measured by eddy covariance system were reliable et and nep of sunflower farmland were calculated by latent heat flux le and carbon flux fc measured by a three dimensional csat3 sonic anemometer gill solent instruments uk with an open path infrared h2o co2 analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa which was installed above the canopy towards southeast perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction all the data were collected by cr3000 data logger once every 30 min 53 et le λ 54 nep n e e f c 55 wue nep et where λ is the heat of water vaporization j kg 1 and nee is net ecosystem exchange of co2 t mm d 1 of sunflower field was calculated by sap velocity sv which was monitored by sgb sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa sv g h was recorded once every 30 min by flow32 1 k system dynamax inc houston tx usa due to the limitation of the wrapped plant stem flow meter the height of the sunflower s stems needs to be above 85 cm to ensure sufficient stem length for instrumentation and retain enough leaves to support the crop transpiration and the monitoring period of sv started in august 13 july 16 and july 19 in 2019 to 2021 respectively in order to obtain a more accurate field transpiration we measured height diameter of stem and leaf area of about 30 sunflowers within the scope of the monitoring field before selecting the measured plants and sv was monitored on four sunflowers whose growth indexes were on the average level in the field 56 t s v ρ w ρ p where s v is the total daily sap flow g d 1 ρ w is the density of water 1 g cm 3 and ρ p is the density of planting 2 6 m2 plant 1 in our study groundwater table depth wtd was measured by piezometers hobo water level logger u20 onset computer corp ma usa accuracy 0 1 cm recorded at 0 5 h intervals using a data logger the arrangement of the eddy covariance system measurement of lai and monitoring of soil moisture salinity and meteorological data were the same as wang et al 2022 above observed experimental data used to evaluate the model included et t nep lai swc and ec and wue of sunflower farmland ecosystem 2 3 verification and accuracy evaluation criteria of the model regression coefficient m determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate the accuracy of simulation when m and r2 are close to 1 it indicates that the simulated value fits well with the measured value and the model has a good performance when rmse is close to 0 the simulation accuracy of model is high nse close to 1 indicates good model quality and high model reliability while nse close to 0 means that the simulation results are close to the average level of the observed values but the simulation error of process is large if it is much less than 0 the model is not credible rmse and nse can be calculated by the following formula 57 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 0 5 58 nse 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where p i is simulated value o i is measured value and n is the number of measured values 3 results 3 1 adjustment of model parameters the experimental data of 2019 were used to calibrate the parameters of model and the experimental data of 2020 and 2021 were used to validate performance of the model during the calibration we set the parameters of model according to the measured data and recommended values referred to the range of parameters provided by previous studies and analyzed the sensitivity and uncertainty of parameters then we adjusted the parameters as their sensitivity and the grid search method was used to determine the optimal parameters to make the simulation result of model closer to measured data the main adjusted parameters in the model are described in table 2 3 2 performance of wue model 3 2 1 et and t the simulated results of daily canopy et and t in growth period of sunflower from 2019 to 2021 and their comparison with the measured values are shown in figs 5 and 6 the results showed that the coupled model could simulate the seasonal variation trend of daily et and t of farmland rationally we couldn t collect complete stem flow data of the whole growth period to fully verify the simulation performance of the model on t due to the limitation of the instrument use of the wrapped plant stem flow meter in general the model had good performance to simulate et dynamics with r2 above 0 60 rmse below 0 87 mm d 1 and nse above 0 6 table 3 overall the simulation results of t were better than that of et with higher nse and r2 it is noted that the measured values of t in 2021 also showed a higher trend compared with the same period of the previous two years this might be due to the fact that the plants selected for measurement were growing better than the entire farmland and the measured stem flow of the plants were slightly higher than that of the entire farmland the overestimation of et at maturity stage in 2020 might be caused by the slightly higher simulated values of t at this stage this might be due to the fact that the lai of sunflower decreased rapidly affected by sunflower broomrape in that year so that the actual t and et were lower than the model simulation values under normal growth conditions without considering the disease 3 2 2 nep the simulated results of daily nep in growth period of sunflower from 2019 to 2021 and their comparison with the measured values are shown in fig 7 in general the model could simulate nep dynamics during the growth period of sunflower well with r2 above 0 74 rmse below 7 39 g co2 m 2 d 1 and nse above 0 68 table 4 it is noted that the simulation of nep had a certain degree of underestimation in 2020 and 2021 from mid july to mid august this directly resulted in simulated values of lai at this stage slightly lower than the measured values fig 8 the overestimation of nep at maturity stage in 2020 might also cause by sunflower broomrape 3 2 3 soil water content and salinity the simulated results of daily swc at different depths in growth period of sunflower from 2019 to 2021 and their comparison with the measured values by hydra probe sensors and taking soil samples are shown in fig 9 the results showed that the developed model could better simulate the dynamic change process of daily swc at different depths with r2 above 0 71 rmse of only 0 03 m3 m 3 and nse above 0 6 table 5 however for a period of time after irrigation the simulated values of swc of deep soil 50 90 cm were slightly higher than the measured values the measured values of swc at 0 10 cm in 2021 remained unchanged after late july while the simulated values showed a large deviation from it however the simulated values were basically consistent with the measured values by taking soil samples which were generally considered to be more accurate it could still be considered that the simulation results of the model met the applicable requirements and could reflect the variation of swc at different depths of sunflower farmland the simulated results of daily soil ec at different depths in growth period of sunflower from 2019 to 2021 and their comparison with the measured values by hydra probe sensors and taking soil samples are shown in fig 10 due to the abnormal sensor data in 2021 there was only a comparison between the measured values by taking soil samples and the simulated values and due to the small number of samples the index evaluation of the simulation accuracy in 2021 was not carried out the results showed that the model could capture the salt accumulation trend within the period of crop growth on the daily scale with r2 above 0 85 rmse of 0 33 ds m 1 and nse above 0 8 table 6 however there was a certain degree of deviation between the simulated values and the measured values for a period of time after irrigation it might be due to the experimental farmland adopted the border irrigation method with a larger irrigation quota which would cause leaching of the soil salt in an instant and the salinity concentration monitored by the sensor would be greatly reduced however the calculation step of the model we developed was one day which failed to capture this dynamic process clearly resulting in the deviation of the simulation during this period although there were no sensor measurement values to evaluate the simulation accuracy in 2021 the fitting degree between simulation results and actual measured values by taking soil samples was relatively high which also reflected that the model could simulate the dynamic changes of soil salinity in the sunflower root zone 3 2 4 water use efficiency as a combined result from farmland nep and et our model could compute daily wue of farmland scale reasonably the simulated results of daily wue in growth period of sunflower from 2019 to 2021 and their comparison with the measured values by eddy covariance system are shown in fig 11 the results showed that the developed model of salinized sunflower farmland considering process coupling could better quantitatively characterize the variation trend of daily wue during the sunflower growth period r2 of the model for three years were above 0 54 rmse were less than 0 61 g c kg 1 h2o and nse reached 0 56 table 7 it could be considered that the developed model met the applicable requirements in the validation phase of the model there was a certain degree of overestimation of the wue at sunflower maturity stage in 2020 and 2021 the overestimation phenomenon at the end of the growth period in 2020 might also be due to the accelerated withering of crop leaves caused by the sunflower broomrape disease in 2021 it might be due to the influence of a heavy rainfall on september 16 with the amount of 33 6 mm the developed model based on stomata was more sensitive to changes in soil moisture resulting in overestimation of the simulated values similarly there was also an overestimation of the simulated values in the few days after the irrigation 3 3 sensitivity analysis of parameters in order to determine the influence of parameter values on the simulation results we selected 6 main parameters in the coupled model and set the amplitudes of 10 30 and 50 respectively and the simulation results of et nep and wue were analyzed as the parameters change the relative changes of the simulation results are shown in fig 12 the change in the value of r s s min had the most significant impact on the et simulation results when its variation was 50 it would cause an increasement of et by about 10 correspondingly as the value of r s s min increased the simulation results of wue also increased but nep had no obvious response to its changes nep and wue were most sensitive to the change of c as the value of c decreased by 50 the simulation results of et increased by 7 while the simulation results of nep and wue decreased by 28 and 3 respectively the influence of n in the canopy on the simulation results were consistent with c while the value of z 0 had no obvious effect on the simulation results r m 0 and t b had little effect on the simulation results of et however as the value of r m 0 increased the simulation results of nep and wue decreased while with the value of t b increased the simulation results increased slightly 4 discussions based on stomata we described the coupling interaction between the various processes of agricultural hydrology from physiological level and the formation of farmland ecosystem wue mechanically wue links carbon and water exchanges between farmlands and the atmosphere baldocchi 1994 scanlon and albertson 2004 accurately quantifying the formation process of wue is essential to reveal the physiological and ecological adaptation mechanisms of crops to the changing environment the developed model in this study was based on stomata which could more intuitively reflect the impact of external environmental factors on farmland hydrological processes it could better describe the response process of crop transpiration and photosynthesis to meteorological factors soil moisture and salinity and different growth stages of crop furthermore based on the response of stomata to soil water salt within different growth stages the proposed model described interaction between soil water salt conditions and crop physiological processes in addition the developed model requires few input parameters including physical properties of soil characteristics of crop daily par vpd t a u c a p i and initial soil moisture salt content and water table depth on the first day through environmental meteorological factors and initial soil water salt conditions the daily crop water consumption growth wue and dynamic changes in soil water salt throughout the growth period can be simulated its applicability in arid climate and salt stress conditions had been verified this provides the possibility to simulate changes in farmland hydrological processes under future climate change and different irrigation regimes conditions while the developed model ignored the hysteresis of response to soil moisture which might make the model too sensitive to the short term and large scale changes of soil water and salt this might be the reason for the bias in simulation of wue after irrigation and heavy rainfall silva and arrabaca 2010 found that the contribution of non stomatal limitations on photosynthesis increases at severe water guo and ogle 2018 found that in a bayesian framework plant water potential exhibited 2 4 days lagged response to daily scale atmospheric moisture demand and 6 7 days lagged response to deep soil water availability wu et al 2020 showed that root water uptake of winter wheat was impacted by the hysteresis effect of water stress the change of nitrogen in soil due to irrigation may also be one of the factors affecting wue liao et al 2022 but the nutrient module has not been added to our model it is possible to adjust a more suitable proportion of soil water salt effects on stomata in the further studies at the same time due to the shallow depth of groundwater and abundant soil moisture in the study area the applicability of the model under different moisture conditions remains to be further verified the developed model had a deviation in the simulation of deeper swc 50 90 cm after irrigation this might be due to the fact that a ground pipe drainage facility was installed at a depth of 1 5 m in the experimental field the groundwater level decreased due to the influence of drainage and the groundwater recharge decreased compared with the simulated values at the same time the deeper groundwater level caused the leakage of the deep soil to increase compared with the simulated values which made the simulated values of the deep soil moisture content higher than measured values some researches indicated that as a soil water source groundwater had substantial effects in soil moisture chen and hu 2004 miguez macho and fan 2012 yang et al 2000 moreover shallow groundwater affects the salt budgets in root zone chen et al 2022 employed a physically based agro hydrological model lawstac in three soil profiles and indicated that shallow groundwater facilitated water and salt fluxes at the root zone furthermore in our model it is assumed that the swc in the transition zone remains unchanged however when the groundwater depth fluctuated greatly after irrigation it might cause changes of swc in the transition zone and cause deviations in simulation of swc in deep soil layer eeman et al 2011 miller 2009 magri et al 2009 found that the transition zone significantly influenced the flow field and the distribution of heat in the schleswig holstein region of germany nevertheless our results showed that the simulation accuracy of the model met the applicability requirements swc simulation results had an average nse of 0 71 in 2019 2021 and ignoring the water movement in the transition zone would greatly improve the computational efficiency of the model in the following research the development process of crop roots might be further considered and the root water absorption module in soil water movement model could be improved so that the simulation process is closer to the actual situation in our study the results of model sensitivity analysis showed that c was the most influencing model parameter it is affected by the light transmittance inclination angle and azimuth angle of the blade and is related to the altitude angle of the sun thus c in the model should be adjusted according to the location of the field and the type of crop the extinction coefficient determines the amount of light energy absorbed by crop soda et al 2010 which determines the rate of transpiration and photosynthesis of crops san oh et al 2006 wallace 2010 transpiration and photosynthesis are the two most important crop physiological processes in farmland hydrology and they are also the critical modules in our developed model in our model c effect r ns in et modules and r ic in nep modules directly thus the value of c is crucial which will have an important impact on the accuracy of the model the results of pathak et al 2007 indicated that c had the most obvious effect on the simulation of dry matter in a cotton model nyombi 2010 showed that in a new dynamic radiation and temperature driven growth model of banana bunch dry matter and lai were reduced with the decrease of c lopez cruz et al 2014 identified that c influenced the behavior of the model applied to husk tomato crop to a greater extent on sucros model while salam et al 1994 developed a model to simulate growth process of rice and the results showed that yield was almost insensitive when c changed in range of 0 65 to 0 8 it was might because that longer duration of the crop might help to compensate the reduce of yield by a lower value of c besides we found that r s s min had the most significant impact on the et simulation results in our model this parameter directly determined r s s and affects the distribution of net radiation between the crop and the soil surface since the planting density of sunflower in our study area was relatively sparse the accurate determination of energy distribution between canopy and soil surface had a great impact on the simulation accuracy of the model 5 conclusions we developed a novel wue model of farmland ecosystem which considered the coupling relationship between crop growth and farmland water salt transport processes the developed model had two characters 1 the model described coupling relationship between transpiration and photosynthesis based on stomatal resistance determined by meteorological factors soil water and salinity 2 the photosynthetic rate drove crop growth and canopy development which affected the water consumption process of the canopy furthermore crop water consumption severely affected the transport process of soil water and salt different from other wue models this model explained the process of farmland wue mechanically this could result in a good performance to simulate dynamic farmland wue and related hydrological processes including et t nep lai soil moisture and salinity of farmland the model considered the interaction of farmland hydrological processes and could reflect the coupled effects of various environmental factors on wue from crop physiological processes in future studies based on the response of crop stomata to changing environment and combined climate forecast model research on simulation of farmland elements under future climate change scenarios will be possible credit authorship contribution statement

2512,water use efficiency wue determined by water carbon coupling process is important to evaluate the relationship between crop growth and water consumption aiming to provide a novel wue dynamic evaluating method at field scale we developed a crop wue model based on stomata which coupled the processes of crop growth and farmland water cycle in previous work we developed a stomatal conductance model in which crop stomatal conductance could be described by its relationship to meteorological factors soil water and salinity in this study we coupled crop transpiration and photosynthesis based on stomata furthermore the model described the daily crop growth and hydrological processes as a result the developed model could simulate the dynamic changes of crop canopy evapotranspiration et canopy photosynthesis dry matter accumulation and assimilation distribution soil water movement soil salt transport and wue of farmland ecosystems on a daily scale three years field experimental data were used to calibrate the developed model the results showed that the model could simulate the variation of agricultural hydrology processes properly in sunflower field on the daily scale with determination coefficient r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of et transpiration and wue all close to 0 60 r2 and nse of net ecosystem productivity above 0 74 and 0 68 respectively and the coupling model had a good performance in simulating the dynamic change process of soil moisture and salt with the r2 and nse above 0 71 and 0 61 respectively sensitivity analysis of model parameters showed that the selection of the extinction coefficient had a great influence on the accuracy of the model and the accurate description of soil resistance parameters played a crucial role in the accurate quantification of et the developed field wue model can provide novel method to evaluate daily hydrological processes agricultural productivity and wue dynamics keywords farmland stomata transpiration photosynthesis water use efficiency coupling model data availability the raw processed data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also forms part of an ongoing study 1 introduction water use efficiency wue is an important parameter for evaluating ecosystem water and carbon cycle ito and inatomi 2012 li et al 2021 unland et al 1996 wue of farmland ecosystem depends on the farmland evapotranspiration and co2 fixation by crops abraha et al 2016 wagle et al 2016 evapotranspiration et is an important part of the farmland water cycle and co2 fixation mainly comes from the crop growth process formed by crop photosynthesis furthermore canopy conductance gc is a key variable that couples crop photosynthesis and transpiration leuning et al 1998 louarn et al 2005 gc depends on meteorological conditions soil water and salinity conditions in the root zone and growth stage of crops dekker et al 2001 rajaona et al 2012 xu et al 2020 at the same time et of canopy directly drives the process of farmland water cycle and changes the soil moisture in the root zone the absorption of co2 determines the growth status of crops and the accumulation of dry matter therefore there is a strong coupling effect between crop growth and farmland water cycle fig 1 accurately quantifying the water carbon coupling process of farmland ecosystems is the basis for evaluating the wue of farmland ecosystems at the farmland scale lots of models combine crop growth processes with field water cycle processes to evaluate farmland water productivity some models realize the coupling between these two processes based on the water balance in the root zone and the water stress on crop growth such as the rzwqm model hanson et al 1998 descripted farmland water cycle process based on physical process of soil hydrodynamics and et calculated by s w model and coupled the dssat crop model which used soil moisture as a factor to stress the rate of crop development and the model utilized the extinction coefficient c associated with et to describe the net photosynthetic rate for coupling transpiration and photosynthesis rzwqm has obvious advantages in simulating water and nutrient cycling in farmland however the large amount of climate soil and crop characteristics data required for model increase the difficulty of model application the swap model van dam jos et al 2008 coupled the world food studies wofost crop growth model with the soil hydrodynamic process the model derived et based on potential evapotranspiration and water salinity stress to crop and derived co2 assimilation rate of crop based on the absorbed radiation and the photosynthesis light response curve with assuming constant ratio of potential to actual rates of transpiration and photosynthesis however the difficulty of determining photosynthetic parameters also affects the application of the model and the aquacrop vanuytrecht et al 2014 model coupled the crop growth model driven by the soil moisture transport process which used the normalized biomass water productivity to couple plant transpiration and accumulated biomass the aquacrop model has the advantages of fewer input parameters wide application range simple interface and strong intuitiveness however it lacks the crop physiology submodule and water nutrient interaction module therefore the applicability of aquacrop model under the conditions of strong water salt stress and temperature stress is limited araya et al 2010 salemi et al 2011 jia et al 2011 coupled wofost model and a distributed hydrological model describing the water and energy transfer processes wep l to analyzed climate change impact on crop yield shi et al 2021 established a coupled crop growth and soil water transport model through numerical simulation which drove crop growth by accumulated temperature and used plant water deficit index to estimate et and based on the developed model they quantified relationship between plant water deficit index and the wue however these models did not adequately consider the coupling relationship between photosynthesis and transpiration some models further describe the interaction between photosynthesis and transpiration based on stomata in order to more accurately describe farmland hydrological processes from physiological level the photosynthesis transpiration coupling models based on stomata can be divided into two categories one is to calculate the photosynthetic rate through photosynthesis model with biochemical process collatz et al 1992 farquhar et al 1980 inversely obtain stomatal conductance through the ball berry model ball et al 1987 and then calculate the transpiration rate according to the evapotranspiration model monteith 1965 penman 1948 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the other one is to estimate the stomatal conductance directly through a model such as jarvis model jarvis 1976 and calculate the photosynthetic rate and the transpiration rate based on the energy balance the diffusion of water vapor and co2 and the law of thermal conductivity of air yu et al 2001 established a coupled photosynthesis transpiration model and a wue model smptsb based on stomatal behavior which was based on the principle of electrical analogy the smptsb model avoids the difficulty of determining the physiological parameters and only employs environmental variables although this model is easier for practical use it ignores the effect of soil moisture hoof et al 2011 combined the crop growth dynamics simulation with the joint uk land environment simulator jules and developed the jules sucros model in the model the exchange of vapor and co2 between plants and the atmosphere were regulated by stomatal resistance to realize the coupling between carbon water and energy fluxes lei et al 2011 constructed a field scale ecohydrological model help c which coupled the crop growth model with the simple biosphere model version 2 sib2 and then combined the distributed hydrological model with help c to simulated water and carbon cycle processes in irrigation areas duan 2020 stablished a crop growth model based on photosynthesis transpiration processes using ball berry model ball et al 1987 and further coupled spac hydrothermal transport model to realize the coupling of crop growth and water cycle processes the ball berry model has the advantages of closer connection between photosynthesis and stomata however the coupling calculation is more complicated which need to iterate photosynthetic stomatal conductance and energy balance model simultaneously wang and leuning 1998 existing farmland hydrological process models still rarely describe the coupling of crop transpiration and photosynthesis centered on stomata and the interaction between soil water salt conditions and crop physiological processes is not fully considered furthermore most models only consider salt stress as a function affecting yield but seldom consider its effect on physiological processes thus the specific objectives of this paper were to 1 develop a wue model coupling crop growth and farmland water cycle processes based on the response of stomata to soil water salt within different growth stages 2 calibrate and verify parameters of model and evaluate model applicability using field data from 2019 to 2021 3 determine parameters sensitivity to output variables of model 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the wue model 2 1 1 model framework the frame of model is illustrated in fig 2 based on the bulk stomatal resistances to water vapor r s c and co2 r sc of canopy the coupling relationship between daily canopy et and photosynthesis was described furthermore the bulk stomatal resistances were determined by environment factors including meteorology soil water salt content of root zone and growth stage of crop the daily net ecosystem productivity nep formed by photosynthesis drove the process of crop growth and dominated the accumulation of dry matter including the formation of leaf area index lai the dynamic movement processes of daily soil water and salt were described by the soil hydrological process model in which et computed with crop transpiration by stomatal resistance and soil evaporation irrigation i precipitation p farmland et soil water movement and exchanges with groundwater constituted the water cycle process of farmland ecosystem the formation of farmland ecosystem wue nep et was described by the coupled crop growth and farmland water cycle processes the detailed descriptions of the model can be found in following sections 2 1 2 stomatal resistance of the canopy bulk stomatal resistance of the canopy r s c s m is the reciprocal of gc which is the most critical resistance parameter for the farmland ecosystem it represents the total resistance of all vegetation stomata to water vapor flux in the canopy and is a comprehensive reflection of the physiological state of the plant to indicate response of r s c to environmental factors in salinity land we developed an improved jarvis stomatal conductance model considering the effect of salinity to estimate r s

expressions of each variable and the parameters of each empirical formula are the same as wang et al 2022 in previous study we had proved that this new stomatal conductance model had good performance for sunflower field due to the difference in relative molecular mass of co2 and h2o there is a coefficient conversion relationship between resistance of stomata to co2 r sc and r s c 2 r sc 1 37 r s c based on r s c and r sc we described the coupling relationship between canopy transpiration and photosynthesis 2 1 3 evapotranspiration usually the soil evaporation e of farmland could not be ignored

water and salt transport model to simulate soil water and salt transport processes of farmland we divided the soil profile into five soil layers of 0 10 10 30 30 50 50 70 and 70 90 cm according to the change of soil texture and the buried depth of the sensors the water exchange between soil water and groundwater and the transport of soil water and salinity between soil layers were simulated farmland soil moisture is mainly replenished by irrigation i precipitation p and capillary rise cr in groundwater and is dissipated into atmosphere through plant transpiration t and soil evaporation e salt enters the farmland soil mainly through irrigation and migrates upward through soil evaporation and transport with soil water the soil moisture content in the transition zone was assumed to be constant in this study due to the experimental field was relatively flat the lateral leakage and replenishment of water were not considered only considering the one dimensional vertical movement of water in the farmland the dynamic change of swc in each soil layer was simulated with 1 day as the time step since the soil water storage was relatively abundant during the growth period it could be considered that the gravity was greater than the substrate suction and only the infiltration process was considered while the redistribution process of water in the soil is ignored assuming that the soil evaporation was only provided by the 0 30 cm soil layer according to the measured swc the proportion of the water content of each soil layer consumed by plant transpiration at each growth stage

using the functional functions provided by the aquacrop model vanuytrecht et al 2014 e and t were calculated by evapotranspiration model salt enters the soil from irrigation water and through capillary rise in groundwater assuming negligible salt content from rainfall at the same time salt migrates upward with crop transpiration accumulates in the surface layer with soil evaporation and is discharged from the soil with the leakage of soil water the simulation of the ec value of each soil layer was carried out using the salt balance module in the aquacrop model vanuytrecht et al 2014 the upper boundary of the farmland water and salt transport model is the farmland evapotranspiration boundary and the lower boundary is the groundwater boundary 2 1 6 coupling of crop growth and soil water salt transport process with the meteorological conditions as input variable the soil water and salt conditions on the first day of growth period as the initial value and 1 day as the time step the processes of crop growth and farmland water salt transport were coupled with the stomatal resistance calculated by meteorological factors soil water salt conditions and lai the daily e t and nep were obtained e and t affected the migration process of soil water and salt and the accumulation of dry matter formed by nep drove the development of lai swc soil ec and lai calculated from the model of the previous day were used as input variables of the second day to realize coupling on the daily scale the total day length of the growth period was used as the judgment condition to end the cycle the dynamic changes of daily et t nep lai wue soil water and salinity during the whole growth period were output the coupling calculation process of the model is shown in fig 3 2 2 field observation experiment 2 2 1 experiment site description the monitoring experiment of crop growth and water cycle process was carried out at a sunflower field 40 43 n 107 16 e 1 038 m from june to september of 2019 2021 in a typical arid and semi arid irrigated agricultural area hetao irrigation area in inner mongolia in the northwest of china the annual average temperature was 6 1 c and sunshine hours were 3100 3200 h per year the average annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were 180 and 2225 mm respectively luan et al 2018 in order to meet crop water requirement and maintain local agricultural development about 5 billion m3 of water is diverted from the yellow river average salinity of 0 05 per year the primary irrigation method was surface flood system sun et al 2013 soil secondary salinity is the main limitation of agricultural production the physical properties and ec of soil at different depths in the experimental site are shown in table 1 the soil in the 0 90 cm soil layer of the sunflower test field is mainly loam with slightly higher sand content of 0 30 cm the soil below 30 cm is silt loam and the soil texture is relatively uniform the field capacity θfc of 1 m soil layer of sunflower farmland varies from 0 30 to 0 36 m3 m 3 the saturated water content θsat is between 0 40 and 0 47 m3 m 3 and the average dry bulk density γ d is 1 62 g cm 3 the average ec of 1 m soil layer of sunflower farmland is 2 59 ds m 1 the salinity is 0 23 based on the 30 cm soil cultivation layer and the experimental field is moderately saline and alkaline soil the planted sunflower variety is edible seed sunflower yg 361 which was sown at the end of may emerged in mid to early june and matured at the end of september the whole growth period was about 120 days during the growth period there was only one irrigation july 9 in 2019 july 10 in 2020 and july 10 in 2021 and the irrigation quota was about 100 mm by means of border irrigation the planting density of sunflower field was 2 6 m2 plant 1 2 2 2 field measurements a water and carbon flux tower were established in an open sunflower field to collect data to calibrate the developed model fig 4 the field enclosed by the solid line was the eddy covariance system monitoring site the total area of sunflower was more than 10 ha the distance between the source area with 90 contribution rate of measurement results and the observation site is about 116 2 m in average during the entire monitoring period and the distance between the point with the largest contribution rate and the observation site is about 18 96 m kljun et al 2002 kormann and meixner 2001 the length of the field on the main wind and wave area was about 250 m which satisfied the measurement requirements at the beginning of the observation the installment height of eddy covariance system was 2 5 m when crop canopy height increased to 1 5 m the observation height was adjusted to 3 5 m the energy closure calculated by energy balance ratio in 2019 2021 were 0 75 0 81 and 0 83 which showed that the fluxes measured by eddy covariance system were reliable et and nep of sunflower farmland were calculated by latent heat flux le

canopy towards southeast perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction all the data were collected by cr3000 data logger once every 30 min 53 et le λ 54 nep n e e f c 55 wue nep et where λ is the heat of water vaporization j kg 1 and nee is net ecosystem exchange of co2 t mm d 1 of sunflower field was calculated by sap velocity sv which was monitored by sgb sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa sv g h was recorded once every 30 min by flow32 1 k system dynamax inc houston tx usa due to the limitation of the wrapped plant stem flow meter the height of the sunflower s stems needs to be above 85 cm to ensure sufficient stem length for instrumentation and retain enough leaves to support the crop transpiration and the monitoring period of sv started in august 13 july 16 and july 19 in 2019 to 2021 respectively in order to obtain a more accurate field transpiration we measured height diameter of stem and leaf area of about 30 sunflowers within the scope of the monitoring field before selecting the measured plants and sv was monitored on four sunflowers whose growth indexes were on the average level in the field 56 t s v ρ w ρ p where s v is the total daily sap flow g d 1 ρ w is the density of water 1 g cm 3 and ρ p is the density of planting 2 6 m2 plant 1 in our study groundwater table depth wtd was measured by piezometers hobo water level logger u20 onset computer corp ma usa accuracy 0 1 cm recorded at 0 5 h intervals using a data logger the arrangement of the eddy covariance system measurement of lai and monitoring of soil moisture salinity and meteorological data were the same as wang et al 2022 above observed experimental data used to evaluate the model included et t nep lai swc and ec and wue of sunflower farmland ecosystem 2 3 verification and accuracy evaluation criteria of the model regression coefficient m determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used to evaluate the accuracy of simulation when m and r2 are close to 1 it indicates that the simulated value fits well with the measured value and the model has a good performance when rmse is close to 0 the simulation accuracy of model is high nse close to 1 indicates good model quality and high model reliability while nse close to 0 means that the simulation results are close to the average level of the observed values but the simulation error of process is large if it is much less than 0 the model is not credible rmse and nse can be calculated by the following formula 57 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 0 5 58 nse 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where p i is simulated value o i is measured value and n is the number of measured values 3 results 3 1 adjustment of model parameters the experimental data of 2019 were used to calibrate the parameters of model and the experimental data of 2020 and 2021 were used to validate performance of the model during the calibration we set the parameters of model according to the measured data and recommended values referred to the range of parameters provided by previous studies and analyzed the sensitivity and uncertainty of parameters then we adjusted the parameters as their sensitivity and the grid search method was used to determine the optimal parameters to make the simulation result of model closer to measured data the main adjusted parameters in the model are described in table 2 3 2 performance of wue model 3 2 1 et and t the simulated results of daily canopy et and t in growth period of sunflower from 2019 to 2021 and their comparison with the measured values are shown in figs 5 and 6 the results showed that the coupled model could simulate the seasonal variation trend of daily et and t of farmland rationally we couldn t collect complete stem flow data of the whole growth period to fully verify the simulation performance of the model on t due to the limitation of the instrument use of the wrapped plant stem flow meter in general the model had good performance to simulate et dynamics with r2 above 0 60 rmse below 0 87 mm d 1 and nse above 0 6 table 3 overall the simulation results of t were better than that of et with higher nse and r2 it is noted that the measured values of t in 2021 also showed a higher trend compared with the same period of the previous two years this might be due to the fact that the plants selected for measurement were growing better than the entire farmland and the measured stem flow of the plants were slightly higher than that of the entire farmland the overestimation of et at maturity stage in 2020 might be caused by the slightly higher simulated values of t at this stage this might be due to the fact that the lai of sunflower decreased rapidly affected by sunflower broomrape in that year so that the actual t and et were lower than the model simulation values under normal growth conditions without considering the disease 3 2 2 nep the simulated results of daily nep in growth period of sunflower from 2019 to 2021 and their comparison with the measured values are shown in fig 7 in general the model could simulate nep dynamics during the growth period of sunflower well with r2 above 0 74 rmse below 7 39 g co2 m 2 d 1 and nse above 0 68 table 4 it is noted that the simulation of nep had a certain degree of underestimation in 2020 and 2021 from mid july to mid august this directly resulted in simulated values of lai at this stage slightly lower than the measured values fig 8 the overestimation of nep at maturity stage in 2020 might also cause by sunflower broomrape 3 2 3 soil water content and salinity the simulated results of daily swc at different depths in growth period of sunflower from 2019 to 2021 and their comparison with the measured values by hydra probe sensors and taking soil samples are shown in fig 9 the results showed that the developed model could better simulate the dynamic change process of daily swc at different depths with r2 above 0 71 rmse of only 0 03 m3 m 3 and nse above 0 6 table 5 however for a period of time after irrigation the simulated values of swc of deep soil 50 90 cm were slightly higher than the measured values the measured values of swc at 0 10 cm in 2021 remained unchanged after late july while the simulated values showed a large deviation from it however the simulated values were basically consistent with the measured values by taking soil samples which were generally considered to be more accurate it could still be considered that the simulation results of the model met the applicable requirements and could reflect the variation of swc at different depths of sunflower farmland the simulated results of daily soil ec at different depths in growth period of sunflower from 2019 to 2021 and their comparison with the measured values by hydra probe sensors and taking soil samples are shown in fig 10 due to the abnormal sensor data in 2021 there was only a comparison between the measured values by taking soil samples and the simulated values and due to the small number of samples the index evaluation of the simulation accuracy in 2021 was not carried out the results showed that the model could capture the salt accumulation trend within the period of crop growth on the daily scale with r2 above 0 85 rmse of 0 33 ds m 1 and nse above 0 8 table 6 however there was a certain degree of deviation between the simulated values and the measured values for a period of time after irrigation it might be due to the experimental farmland adopted the border irrigation method with a larger irrigation quota which would cause leaching of the soil salt in an instant and the salinity concentration monitored by the sensor would be greatly reduced however the calculation step of the model we developed was one day which failed to capture this dynamic process clearly resulting in the deviation of the simulation during this period although there were no sensor measurement values to evaluate the simulation accuracy in 2021 the fitting degree between simulation results and actual measured values by taking soil samples was relatively high which also reflected that the model could simulate the dynamic changes of soil salinity in the sunflower root zone 3 2 4 water use efficiency as a combined result from farmland nep and et our model could compute daily wue of farmland scale reasonably the simulated results of daily wue in growth period of sunflower from 2019 to 2021 and their comparison with the measured values by eddy covariance system are shown in fig 11 the results showed that the developed model of salinized sunflower farmland considering process coupling could better quantitatively characterize the variation trend of daily wue during the sunflower growth period r2 of the model for three years were above 0 54 rmse were less than 0 61 g c kg 1 h2o and nse reached 0 56 table 7 it could be considered that the developed model met the applicable requirements in the validation phase of the model there was a certain degree of overestimation of the wue at sunflower maturity stage in 2020 and 2021 the overestimation phenomenon at the end of the growth period in 2020 might also be due to the accelerated withering of crop leaves caused by the sunflower broomrape disease in 2021 it might be due to the influence of a heavy rainfall on september 16 with the amount of 33 6 mm the developed model based on stomata was more sensitive to changes in soil moisture resulting in overestimation of the simulated values similarly there was also an overestimation of the simulated values in the few days after the irrigation 3 3 sensitivity analysis of parameters in order to determine the influence of parameter values on the simulation results we selected 6 main parameters in the coupled model and set the amplitudes of 10 30 and 50 respectively and the simulation results of et nep and wue were analyzed as the parameters change the relative changes of the simulation results are shown in fig 12 the change in the value of r s s min had the most significant impact on the et simulation results when its variation was 50 it would cause an increasement of et by about 10 correspondingly as the value of r s s min increased the simulation results of wue also increased but nep had no obvious response to its changes nep and wue were most sensitive to the change of c as the value of c decreased by 50 the simulation results of et increased by 7 while the simulation results of nep and wue decreased by 28 and 3 respectively the influence of n in the canopy on the simulation results were consistent with c while the value of z 0 had no obvious effect on the simulation results r m 0 and t b had little effect on the simulation results of et however as the value of r m 0 increased the simulation results of nep and wue decreased while with the value of t b increased the simulation results increased slightly 4 discussions based on stomata we described the coupling interaction between the various processes of agricultural hydrology from physiological level and the formation of farmland ecosystem wue mechanically wue links carbon and water exchanges between farmlands and the atmosphere baldocchi 1994 scanlon and albertson 2004 accurately quantifying the formation process of wue is essential to reveal the physiological and ecological adaptation mechanisms of crops to the changing environment the developed model in this study was based on stomata which could more intuitively reflect the impact of external environmental factors on farmland hydrological processes it could better describe the response process of crop transpiration and photosynthesis to meteorological factors soil moisture and salinity and different growth stages of crop furthermore based on the response of stomata to soil water salt within different growth stages the proposed model described interaction between soil water salt conditions and crop physiological processes in addition the developed model requires few input parameters including physical properties of soil characteristics of crop daily par vpd t a u c a p i and initial soil moisture salt content and water table depth on the first day through environmental meteorological factors and initial soil water salt conditions the daily crop water consumption growth wue and dynamic changes in soil water salt throughout the growth period can be simulated its applicability in arid climate and salt stress conditions had been verified this provides the possibility to simulate changes in farmland hydrological processes under future climate change and different irrigation regimes conditions while the developed model ignored the hysteresis of response to soil moisture which might make the model too sensitive to the short term and large scale changes of soil water and salt this might be the reason for the bias in simulation of wue after irrigation and heavy rainfall silva and arrabaca 2010 found that the contribution of non stomatal limitations on photosynthesis increases at severe water guo and ogle 2018 found that in a bayesian framework plant water potential exhibited 2 4 days lagged response to daily scale atmospheric moisture demand and 6 7 days lagged response to deep soil water availability wu et al 2020 showed that root water uptake of winter wheat was impacted by the hysteresis effect of water stress the change of nitrogen in soil due to irrigation may also be one of the factors affecting wue liao et al 2022 but the nutrient module has not been added to our model it is possible to adjust a more suitable proportion of soil water salt effects on stomata in the further studies at the same time due to the shallow depth of groundwater and abundant soil moisture in the study area the applicability of the model under different moisture conditions remains to be further verified the developed model had a deviation in the simulation of deeper swc 50 90 cm after irrigation this might be due to the fact that a ground pipe drainage facility was installed at a depth of 1 5 m in the experimental field the groundwater level decreased due to the influence of drainage and the groundwater recharge decreased compared with the simulated values at the same time the deeper groundwater level caused the leakage of the deep soil to increase compared with the simulated values which made the simulated values of the deep soil moisture content higher than measured values some researches indicated that as a soil water source groundwater had substantial effects in soil moisture chen and hu 2004 miguez macho and fan 2012 yang et al 2000 moreover shallow groundwater affects the salt budgets in root zone chen et al 2022 employed a physically based agro hydrological model lawstac in three soil profiles and indicated that shallow groundwater facilitated water and salt fluxes at the root zone furthermore in our model it is assumed that the swc in the transition zone remains unchanged however when the groundwater depth fluctuated greatly after irrigation it might cause changes of swc in the transition zone and cause deviations in simulation of swc in deep soil layer eeman et al 2011 miller 2009 magri et al 2009 found that the transition zone significantly influenced the flow field and the distribution of heat in the schleswig holstein region of germany nevertheless our results showed that the simulation accuracy of the model met the applicability requirements swc simulation results had an average nse of 0 71 in 2019 2021 and ignoring the water movement in the transition zone would greatly improve the computational efficiency of the model in the following research the development process of crop roots might be further considered and the root water absorption module in soil water movement model could be improved so that the simulation process is closer to the actual situation in our study the results of model sensitivity analysis showed that c was the most influencing model parameter it is affected by the light transmittance inclination angle and azimuth angle of the blade and is related to the altitude angle of the sun thus c in the model should be adjusted according to the location of the field and the type of crop the extinction coefficient determines the amount of light energy absorbed by crop soda et al 2010 which determines the rate of transpiration and photosynthesis of crops san oh et al 2006 wallace 2010 transpiration and photosynthesis are the two most important crop physiological processes in farmland hydrology and they are also the critical modules in our developed model in our model c effect r ns in et modules and r ic in nep modules directly thus the value of c is crucial which will have an important impact on the accuracy of the model the results of pathak et al 2007 indicated that c had the most obvious effect on the simulation of dry matter in a cotton model nyombi 2010 showed that in a new dynamic radiation and temperature driven growth model of banana bunch dry matter and lai were reduced with the decrease of c lopez cruz et al 2014 identified that c influenced the behavior of the model applied to husk tomato crop to a greater extent on sucros model while salam et al 1994 developed a model to simulate growth process of rice and the results showed that yield was almost insensitive when c changed in range of 0 65 to 0 8 it was might because that longer duration of the crop might help to compensate the reduce of yield by a lower value of c besides we found that r s s min had the most significant impact on the et simulation results in our model this parameter directly determined r s s and affects the distribution of net radiation between the crop and the soil surface since the planting density of sunflower in our study area was relatively sparse the accurate determination of energy distribution between canopy and soil surface had a great impact on the simulation accuracy of the model 5 conclusions we developed a novel wue model of farmland ecosystem which considered the coupling relationship between crop growth and farmland water salt transport processes the developed model had two characters 1 the model described coupling relationship between transpiration and photosynthesis based on stomatal resistance determined by meteorological factors soil water and salinity 2 the photosynthetic rate drove crop growth and canopy development which affected the water consumption process of the canopy furthermore crop water consumption severely affected the transport process of soil water and salt different from other wue models this model explained the process of farmland wue mechanically this could result in a good performance to simulate dynamic farmland wue and related hydrological processes including et t nep lai soil moisture and salinity of farmland the model considered the interaction of farmland hydrological processes and could reflect the coupled effects of various environmental factors on wue from crop physiological processes in future studies based on the response of crop stomata to changing environment and combined climate forecast model research on simulation of farmland elements under future climate change scenarios will be possible credit authorship contribution statement

2513,while studies of the spatial distribution of precipitation isotope contents is well known at large scale and for more or less homogeneous areas regions with complex topography and aerology are more sparsely or not at all documented the aim of this research is to understand the factors influencing spatial temporal changes of isotopes content in rainfall over a heterogeneous region the region presents strong topographic contrasts an insular context with varied weather exposure and subsequent microclimates the approach consists in building isotopes landscapes isoscapes for different months taking advantage of the 7 year long monthly monitoring survey of the corsica network for isotopes in precipitation cnip corsica france isoscapes use linear predictions based on multiple regressions of station based precipitation isotope climatic and topographic data these regressions reveal the controlling effect of altitude with a dichotomous pattern observed between the winter and the summer periods and slope while meteorological settings partially influence isotope contents by explaining 88 of the δ18o spatial variability isoscapes highlight both a controlling effect of local scale meteorological circulation and a contribution of micro scale dynamics due to topographic forcing on the precipitation isotopes content the analysis of residual values revealed that these two effects are not sufficient to explain the depletion in heavy isotopes the deuterium excess was used to investigate the influence of large scale meteorological systems taking into account previous meteorological investigation it was possible for the first time to hypothesize an influence of types of precipitation convective or stratiform on the rainwater isotopic composition in the study region finally these results appear as evidence of the climate complexity in areas with steep reliefs and a potential limitation for generating reliable isoscapes in mediterranean regions they also demonstrate the role that isoscapes can play in documenting the microclimate processes in the world keywords stable isotopes rainfall microclimate mapping corsica mediterranean region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction through the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea 2008 and several national regional monitoring programs information on factors influencing isotopes in rainfall is relatively well understood thereby advancing climate research gat and carmi 1970 lorius and merlivat 1977 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 förstel and hützen 1982 datta et al 1991 celle jeanton et al 2001 stumpp et al 2014 giustini et al 2016 chen et al 2017 however over several decades there has been strong demand for accurate spatio temporal predictions of point regional and continental scale isotope values in precipitation this demand for isotope prediction arose from the ecological wildlife food source traceability and forensic sciences after it was revealed that the 2h and 18o values of some plant animal and human tissues closely mirrored isotopic patterns of precipitation hobson and wassenaar 1997 bowen et al 2005 this is especially important for regions that are poorly or not covered by observational data moreover if the spatial distribution pattern of isotope contents is well known at large scale and for more or less homogeneous areas the same is not the case for much more complex physiographic situations involving strong topographic contrasts island contexts under multiple weather exposure and or involving microclimates in this respect corsica island france western mediterranean represents a unique hydroclimatic and topographic context which makes it an interesting site for studying the distribution of isotopes in heterogeneous regions it is an area combining various geomorphological domains and has often been described by geographers as a mountain in the sea rome and giorgetti 2008 on the basis of temporal and spatial rainfall isotope content coverage from the corsica network for isotopes in precipitation cnip established in 2013 the aim of this study is to propose the isotope landscape isoscape west et al 2010 i e maps of spatial isotopic variation of stable isotopes in precipitation of this region for the different months it is worth noting that spatial precipitation isotope distribution patterns can lead to improved understanding of large scale water cycle dynamics and surface atmosphere vapour fluxes salati et al 1979 gat et al 2003 worden et al 2007 noone and sturm 2010 in addition maps of spatial variations in precipitation isotope ratios will be useful for surface and sub surface hydrology studies allowing partitioning of water origins fekete et al 2006 bowen et al 2007 wassenaar et al 2011 bedaso wu 2020 mattei et al 2021 by working on the physiographically contrasted island of corsica 8 722 km2 composed of a mountain range up to 2706 m asl separating a succession of parallel valleys on either side steeper to the west and leading to a vast plain on the eastern side the challenge here is to develop a model at small scale previous studies have mainly been conducted at global van der veer et al 2009 bowen 2010 and country e g wassenaar et al 2009 delavau et al 2011 scale although the regionalized cluster based water isotope prediction rcwip approach for predictive rainfall isotopes terzer et al 2013 terzer et al 2021 outperformed that of bowen bowen and wilkinson 2002 bowen and revenaugh 2003 with 67 of reliability when compared to observed data this method remains difficult to apply at small scale requiring a minimum of 15 stations for each climatic zone the aim of the downscaling approach proposed here is to capture and integrate various topographic and meteorological settings in order to enable a good an accurate a detailed examination of specific microclimate effects on isotopes while similar study has been performed in latin america for instance covering the pacific region e g sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 the mediterranean domain is still lacking large spatial isotopic investigation of hydro climatic conditions however it is one of the world s hot spots of climate change where forecasted global warming and dryness are likely to greatly affect the environment and human activities ipcc 2007 pachauri et al 2014 therefore this work is supposed to be a reference and could be easily applied especially for territories with steep relief in other mediterranean region furthermore the complex relief of corsica will provide a basis for discussion of the accuracy of predictions in mountains compared to lowland areas such studies are well known to i contribute to improve understanding in climate circulation e g vachon et al 2010 baisden et al 2016 shi et al 2020 ii highlight the link between meteroric water groundwater and surface water e g sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 bedaso and wu 2020 cole and boutt 2021 and even to iii develop proxies for geographic locations of fauna and humans e g reynard et al 2020 the investigations are primarily based on the understanding of geomorphological aspects and the main hydroclimatic features of the study area the corsica network of isotopes in precipitation cnip and the sampling strategy are presented and then the model developed to construct the isoscapes it is worth noting that the cnip is certainly the most long standing one with the longest continuous records in the mediterranean domain the results are beneficial for understanding the climate variability in this worldwide hotspot of climate change ipcc 2007 pachauri et al 2014 in addition the monthly isoscapes are expected to provide an assessment of the control exerted by topographic and climatic variables on precipitation isotopes what the iscoscapes reveal in terms of climate circulation is also discussed with regard to deuterium excess and residual values from the model the paper ends with some recommendations for further improvement of the model especially in high relief domains and outlines the perspectives concerning the implications of the obtained results for atmospheric and hydrological studies 2 study area main hydroclimatic features with a surface area of 8722 km2 and an average altitude of 568 m corsica is respectively the fourth largest and the most mountainous island in the mediterranean region a steep and rugged mountain ridge traverses the island from north to south including altitudes up to 2706 m above sea level a s l with more than twenty peaks exceeding 2000 m a s l fig 1 according to bruno et al 2001 54 of the island is at an altitude above 400 m a s l and almost 20 of its surface exceeds 1000 m a s l in the western and northern parts of the island several high mountain ridges extend close to the coastline breached by valleys oriented in the southwest to northeast direction reaching far inland in contrast the eastern part of the island is characterized by valleys stretching over the coastal plain fig 1 this geomorphological contrast between the eastern and western sides of the island is also marked by the slopes respectively gentle and steep in this topographically complex area a particular heterogeneous distribution of precipitation patterns is observed bruno et al 2001 knerr et al 2020 from the coastal zone to the inner island the annual rainfall varies from 500 to 2000 mm year with autumn and winter seasons accounting for most of the precipitation the amount of precipitation decreases progressively during the spring period and the summer months are very dry supplementary material 1 however violent summer rainstorms can occur and lead to considerable runoff flow rates in streams and rivers due to the steep slopes and the very short reaction times of the watersheds brigode et al 2019 the seasonal variation of air temperatures shows a negative correlation with this precipitation regime the annual sunshine rate is one the highest in mediterranean region with mean values of 22 29 31 and 19 days respectively for winter spring summer and autumn bruno et al 2001 however this climatic parameter is very heterogeneous spatially depending on the slope exposure overall given this context latitudinal location and its altitudinal range the climate of corsica ranges from subtropical conditions hot summers characterized by temperatures above 22 c and relatively short winters with average temperatures around 10 c in the lowlands to alpine conditions in the mountains characterized by snowfall during the winter bruno et al 2001 knerr et al 2020 concerning the regional atmospheric circulations extratropical westerlies in the mediterranean region strongly affect the precipitation dynamics e g dayan et al 2015 westerlies dominate the winter season december to february djf contrasting with dry summers june to august jja in djf extratropical westerlies transport the water vapour from the atlantic to the mediterranean associated with cyclones and frontal precipitation in contrast during jja the synoptic forcing is rather weak without any cyclonic activity from the west while sea slope breezes predominate for onshore moisture transport burlando et al 2008 furberg et al 2002 the establishment of storms or cyclonic events is especially observed after the summer during the autumn months when the sea surface temperature is very high often leading to high precipitation events hpes lambert and argence 2008 scheffknecht et al 2017 show that more than half of the hpes occur from september to december and almost 20 in october the most active month the eastern half of the island is most affected by hpes scheffknecht et al 2017 the latter are generally associated with strong advections of humid low level air blocked by the orography in addition in term of moisture source at large scale juhlke et al 2020 by using hysplit backward trajectory highlighted the dominance of mediterranean sea followed by western europe and atlantic ocean the control exerted by topography on the local climate in the region is very significant it has been pointed out that the topography also leads to small scale breeze systems which modify the large scale precipitation patterns in the mediterranean gao et al 2006 and particularly in corsica knerr et al 2020 in addition to westerlies and breeze effects the influence of winds from eastern europe has also to be considered and sometimes different types of circulation can combine together bruno et al 2001 juhlke et al 2020 fig 1 summarizes the different aspects of this atmospheric circulation with warm in autumn or cool in winter south easterly winds and westerlies through to large scale atlantic cyclones 3 materials and methods 3 1 rainfall sampling and isotope analysis monthly rainfall sampling was carried out from 2013 to 2019 in the framework of the cnip network which consists in 10 stations scattered over the island territory where stable isotopes of the water molecule are measured monthly on a totalized sample it represents nowadays one of the densest records of precipitation isotope observational data in the mediterranean region the ten stations fig 1 and table 1 are evenly distributed throughout the island with five coastal sites bastia ile rousse ajaccio bonifacio and aleria and five inner stations pirio corte campana palneca and capanella for each station meteorological data monthly precipitation and air temperature were obtained from meteo france https donneespubliques meteofrance fr palmex rainfall collectors were implanted according to iaea recommendations iaea gnip 2014 each station is sampled at the end of the month taking care to avoid any evaporation effect water is collected in 50 ml amber glass bottles and analysed at the hydrogeology department of the university of corsica cnrs umr 6134 spe for 18o and 2h analyses were performed by a dlt 100 laser based liquid vapour stable isotope analyser according to the analytical procedure recommended by the international atomic energy agency penna et al 2010 the analytical precision was better than 0 5 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o the ratio of isotopes rsample is given in the delta notation as δ value which is the relative deviation of the sample from a standard rstandard 1 δ r sample r standard r standard x 1000 where rsample and rstandard are isotope ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o v smow vienna standard mean ocean water was used as the reference standard for both 18o and 2h later on in the article there will be a focus on oxygen 18 especially for mapping since deuterium and oxygen 18 have the same physical properties and they are abide by the same isotopic fractionation laws fontes 1976 3 2 isoscape building the developed model inspired from terzer et al 2013 uses linear predictions based on multiple regressions of station based precipitation isotope climatic and topographic data the correlations between δ18o and spatial parameters for each station were determined by using long term average weighted mean for δ18oweighted equation 2 of each month for this calculation it was necessary to take into account the geomorphological differences between the western and eastern sides of corsica the parameters considered are elevation degree of slope and the distance from the sea the link between meteorological settings amount of precipitation air temperature vapour pressure and rainfall isotopes was assessed on the basis of long term data gathered for each sampling month fig 2 shows a simplified description of this approach which is inspired by terzer et al 2013 integrating new spatial settings but without climatic zone clustering 2 δ weighted δ i p i p i 3 2 1 gridded data sets meteorological data mean monthly precipitation air temperature and vapour pressure were extracted from the french weather service model safran durand et al 1993 durand et al 1999 which provides daily weather data for a 8 km grid spaced over the study region for the 2010 2020 period https publitheque meteo fr vapour pressure was calculated from temperature and relative humidity using the equations given by the world meteorological organization wmo 2008 the altitude values used in this paper come from the dem data provided by the ign french national institute of geographic and forest information https geoservices ign fr with a 250 m resolution the slopes grid was obtained by processing the dem with the arc toolbox on arc gis 10 8 1 3 2 2 regression models the regression models were derived from all possible combinations of the above mentioned variables which are accessible and can easily be considered as indicators of small and large scale atmospheric circulation therefore for a given month the general equation of the model is provided in eq 3 3 δ 18 o a x b y c z d where δ18o was the predicted value a b c where the regression coefficients and d denoted the intercept while x y z represent the parameters precipitation amount air temperature altitude etc showing best fit relationship with isotopes the best fit combinations were selected if they met an acceptance criterion of r 0 6 however if no suitable regression equation satisfying the acceptance criteria was obtained for a given month the global best fit regression equation for the corresponding month was applied by default to the month 3 2 3 co kriging the best regressions obtained were interpolated onto the gridded surface by means of co kriging with parameters climatic and or spatial fitting the acceptance criteria the co kriging on arc gis software provided a robust geostatistical interpolation method exploiting the spatial autocorrelation of natural features delhomme 1978 this function was based on the classic variogram model which describes the degree of spatial dependence of different points cressie 1993 bowen 2010 terzer et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 general patterns table 1 shows the weighted mean signature for stable isotopes of the water molecule in precipitation of each sampling station in corsica likewise long term mean data of precipitation and temperature are presented in this table and monthly averaged values of each sites are shown in supplementary material 2 coastal sites having altitudes ranging from 0 to 99 m a s l show annual rainfall amounts ranging from 613 3 mm to 905 5 mm while yearly temperatures vary from 16 c to 17 6 c thus the hotest site is aléria which has the lowest record of rainfall and the highest annual temperature table 1 the station of bastia is the most distinct close to sea level it exhibits annual rainfall approximately equal to 900 mm considerably higher than that recorded elsewhere in coastal areas of the island this high humidity in the eastern side not mainly exposed to humid winds may be associated with a strong maritime influence moreover the ns direction of the cap corse chain north of bastia fig 1 can also help to explain this behaviour according to bruno et al 2001 when the air mass crosses the mountains under the influence of a strong gradient significant showers can occur on the opposite slope for inland stations with altitudes ranging from 184 to 1675 m a s l the precipitation varies between 830 8 mm and 1700 mm while temperatures range from 8 1 to 16 c it is clear for these stations that the more the altitude increases the more the rainfall increases and the air temperature decreases this pattern is not normally observed in terms of isotopes the most enriched δ2h and δ18o weighted means are observed at bastia 0 m a s l and the most depleted at capanella 1675 m a s l the non linearity between altitude and rainfall isotopes is highlighted for instance between pirio 184 m a s l and corte 429 m a s l the first despite its low elevation is more depleted than the second more elevated fig 3 this shows the complexity of the distribution of rainfall isotopes in the region and implies that in addition to the classical well known parameters such as rainfall and altitude other factors can control the spatial distribution of precipitation stable isotopes the local meteoric water line lmwl determined by using precipitation weighted least squares regression pwlsr hughes and crawford 2012 at a regional level and considering all monthly data from the sampling period at all sampling sites n 759 r2 0 80 defines the corsica meteoric water line cmwl as follows 4 δ 2 h 8 00 0 03 δ 18 o 13 30 0 15 it is very close to that obtained by celle 2000 for the western mediterranean zone δ2h 8 δ18o 14 the obtained deuterium excess reflects the main atlantic fingerprint deuterium excess of 10 and the secondary influence of the eastern mediterranean deuterium excess of 22 gat and carmi 1970 on corsican precipitation in good agreement with the regional air mass circulation dynamics pattern however by analysing each station of the cnip all individual lmwls indicate smaller slopes and intercept compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 rozanski et al 1993 and the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl celle 2000 the high variability of the lmwls tends to indicate that the isotopic signature of rainfall is unique for each individual station according to its location proximity to the sea elevation position in relation to the air mass trajectory etc or the influence of a parameter does not remain proportional from one station to another slopes and intercepts range from 6 12 to 7 54 and 2 97 to 8 69 respectively table 1 these lower slopes under 8 0 indicate secondary evaporation which occurs after condensation as raindrops fall through a dry air column imparting kinetic fractionation on the drops themselves dansgaard 1964 this effect is well known in the mediterranean context celle et al 2000 giustini et al 2016 and has already been documented in corsica by van geldern et al 2014 and santoni et al 2018 the high rate of evaporation in the mediterranean and the hottest conditions recorded in this area lionello 2012 are elements to take into consideration to explain this phenomenon this is especially true as it is observed that the lowest slope corresponds to the least rainy areas with a mediterranean climate and the highest slopes to the most humid zones which correspond to alpine climate domains table 1 furthermore it is worth noting that for areas with approximately the same mean annual rainfall there is a significant difference in terms of slope depending on the location by considering only stations lower than 600 m a s l in order to minimize topographic effects the results show that the stations on the western side of the mountains have generally steeper slopes mean of 7 20 than those on the eastern side mean of 6 85 this can be explained by the fact that the western side of the island is more exposed to humid air masses coming from the atlantic ocean and due to a foehn effect the stations on the eastern side are generally less watered in the same way evaporation and other local parameters rainfall amount elevation air temperature all influence the values of the intercept d on the eastern side d varies from 2 97 to 8 40 with a mean of 6 and from 5 00 to 8 06 with an average of 6 85 for western stations generally lower intercepts are associated with less precipitation and higher temperatures indicating secondary evaporation effects during rainout dansgaard 1964 similarly this spatial pattern of slopes and d intercept of lmwls was also observed in italy longinelli and selmo 2003 and giustini et al 2016 and germany stumpp et al 2014 where authors recorded an increase in slope and deuterium excess from coast to inland in italy and increase in slope from west to east for stations 200 m a sl in germany a spatial homogeneity of station distribution patterns can be observed for the cnip since positive correlation coefficients are observed everywhere in the matrix for isotopic composition in precipitation for each sampling station table 2 this means that the seasonal variation of δ18o is generally consistent over the island however on the other hand the fact that significant correlations are observed between stations from different sides of the island and different altitudes highlights once again the complexity of the spatial distribution of precipitation isotopes over the study region 4 2 regression analysis local climate controls 4 2 1 control of the topography on precipitation isotopes in this section the influence of orography on the stable isotope composition of precipitation is assessed the geographical factors that have been considered are i the elevation ii the distance from the sea and iii the slope of the terrain elevation and distance from the sea are strongly correlated on the western r 0 96 and eastern r 0 88 sides of the island concerning the slopes they are well correlated with altitudes in the east r 0 90 while their relationships with altitudes are partial r 0 50 for western stations the slopes in this context of complex topography would be associated with microclimatic phenomena related to slope and valley breezes mechanisms orography is known to modulate the effect of both larger weather systems e g frontal systems and regional circulation breeze systems on the land surface fernandez et al 2003 smith et al 2012 as described in section 3 the regression coefficients showing the link between these spatial parameters and precipitation δ18o are shown in table 3 the analysis was carried out by discriminating the two sides of the island regarding the geomorphological differences observed between them and also reflected on lmwls as highlighted in the previous section 4 2 2 altitude effect monthly correlation coefficients r for altitude versus δ18o range between 0 99 and 0 36 for western stations while they vary from 0 93 to 0 27 for eastern stations table 3 thus globally the δ18o values become depleted with increasing altitude as expected by the rayleigh distillation process of water vapour as air masses rise and cool gonfiantini et al 2001 kern et al 2020 however regarding the wide range of r this altitude effect varies considerably from one month to another highlighting the probable influence of other parameters moreover as expected significant differences in term of isotopes depletion have been observed between the west and the east of the island on the western side the depletion due to altitude effect is more exacerbated in djf winter and mam spring while the link between δ18o and elevation is weak for summer jja and autumn son months in august instead of depletion an enrichment in isotopes is rather observed with an increase in altitude table 3 however for the eastern side the relationship between precipitation δ18o and altitude is reinforced in summer and autumn with low correlation coefficients recorded in djf therefore for the both sides of the island it is worth noting that the spatial distribution of rainfall isotopes shows different behaviours according to the seasons the contrasted pattern observed between the winter and the summer periods can be explained by the fact that in jja the vertical atmospheric mixing height is more important than other months limiting the isotope depletion with elevation according to kern et al 2014 who worked in the swiss alpine domain furthermore in jja the western slope may act as a leeward slope due to water vapour coming from the tyrrhenian side as westerlies are absent this can also explain the contrast observed between the two seasons and especially the difference recorded from one side to the other during the summer the tyrrhenian side of the island is more exposed to humid winds while in djf there is a dominance of westerlies and the tyrrhenian side of corsica corresponds to a leeward slope leading to a weak relationship between altitudes and δ18o at this time this phenomenon also observed in the high relief domains of adriatic pannonian region northern plateau of mexico and canadian rocky mountains moran 2007 quezadas et al 2021 kern et al 2020 can explain the unexpected positive correlation between δ18o and altitudes in august which is probably accentuated by breeze effects when the bottom of the valleys is colder than the tops of the slope the isotopic gradients determined for each month table 4 show less variation on the homogeneous eastern side compared to the steeper western slope monthly isotopic lapse rates range from 0 39 100 m to 0 04 100 m with a mean of 0 20 and from 0 25 100 m to 0 06 100 m with a mean of 0 14 100 m for the western and eastern sides of the island respectively table 4 a gradient of 0 20 100 m is very close to the mean value of the vertical gradients measured on the adriatic side of the italian peninsula hauser et al 1980 grassa et al 2006 liotta et al 2013 giustini et al 2016 in different regions of the alps pearson et al 1991 ofterdinger et al 2004 kralik et al 2003 and in tropical mountains of south america gonfiantini et al 2001 sánchez murillo et al 2020 however the value of 0 14 obtained for eastern stations is similar to that of the tyrrhenian side of italy giustini et al 2016 4 2 3 influence of slopes the control of topography over precipitation isotopes is confirmed when looking at the relationship between the slopes of the terrain and isotopes values generally the steeper the slope of the terrain is the more the isotope content will be depleted table 3 this is particularly true for the western part of corsica which is more steeply sloping featuring very deep valleys where the air masses often remain engulfed the rainfall isotopes decrease strongly with the slope in djf while in july august and november they increase strongly with the slope table 4 therefore when the altitude effect is insufficient to explain the isotope depletion the control exerted by the slope is evident the non linear relationship between elevation and precipitation on δ18o can be related to the slope of the terrain this can explain for example why a low elevated inland station such as pirio exhibits lower contents in isotopes compared to more elevated stations table 1 for the tyrrhenian side the correlation coefficients between slopes and δ18o are almost identical to those for altitude versus δ18o in this homogeneous area in term of geomorphology the slopes are well superimposed on altitudes and the relationships with precipitation isotopes are similar 4 2 4 continental effect concerning the distance from the sea as it is strongly associated with altitude the relationships with δ18o in precipitation are similar to that observed between δ18o and elevation therefore in this paper continental and altitude effects are related with each other with very similar correlation coefficients for each month table 3 in summary the strong influence of spatial parameters on isotopic contents of precipitation highlights the orographic forcing on the local climate certainly leading to the development of microclimates 4 2 5 control of meteorological parameters over precipitation isotopes the monthly correlation coefficients between δ18o and major meteorological parameters air temperature precipitation and vapour pressure are shown in table 5 4 2 6 temperature effect the δ18o value shows a partial dependence 0 22 r 0 69 on air temperature this is in good agreement with the temperature effect observed at mid and high latitude regions iaea 2000 vystavna et al 2021 however a r 0 6 is only observed in february when the lowest temperatures are recorded thus compared to intermediate and warm temperatures precipitation isotopes distribution is more impacted by cold temperatures forcing which induces considerable depletion in stable isotopes indeed fractionation is greater at lower temperatures in the atmosphere dansgaard 1964 4 2 7 precipitation amount effect concerning the precipitation amount effect the relationship between precipitation amount and δ18o is negative for each month nevertheless the amount effect appears to be highest in march r 0 62 and in october r 0 70 when there are frontal passages of air masses and intense cyclonic activity bruno et al 2001 the partial influence of air temperature and rainfall the two local meteorological parameters characterizing the seasons is an indication that rather than a local atmospheric dynamic it is large scale meteorological events that can affect isotope contents this has been shown for instance in western central africa risi et al 2008 nlend et al 2020 south america vuille and wermer 2005 samuels crow et al 2014 and china he et al 2015 yu et al 2016 gao et al 2018 4 2 8 vapour pressure control a significant p 0 05 positive correlation is apparent between δ18o and vapour pressure for each month table 5 however a strong relationship r 0 6 is only observed for the month of february the higher the vapour pressure the more the isotope content in precipitation is high this relationship observed for february and even all along the year is not in good agreement with information from literature indeed the fractionation is greater at lower temperatures in the atmosphere dansgaard 1964 merlivat and jouzel 1979 yu et al 2006 in summary based on long term monitoring of rainfall isotopes from the cnip an assessment of the influence of meteorological and topographic parameters on precipitation isotopic signature was conducted stronger control over precipitation isotopes exerted by altitude and slope is highlighted rather than a strong influence of the meteorological parameters the influence of slope is more highlighted to the west where the relief is steep this parameter which reflects the deepness of valleys is supposed to favour microclimatic conditions at a given site the partial control of local meteorological parameters involves a stronger dominance of a large scale atmospheric dynamic over local precipitation isotopes on the basis of these results the next section will propose a predictive map of δ18o spatial distribution which will be useful to have a first appreciation of the control of large scale local and micro scale climatic phenomena 4 3 corsica monthly δ18o isoscapes based on best relationships tables 4 and 5 optimal multi linear regressions were used to establish accurate isoscapes fig 4 on these maps various spatial patterns of precipitation δ18o can be observed indicating a clear seasonal effect on isotope variations the specific sites with higher and lower isotope contents all year round are also highlighted regarding the contrasts observed between the west and the east isoscapes were built separately for each side of the study region it was assumed that the slope of the terrain relates to micro scale as explained above and precipitation which generally increases with altitude distance from the sea corresponds to local climate circulation in djf for the western zone the parameters considered for isotope prediction are altitude distance from the sea precipitation water vapour and slope therefore this implies for these months a combination of micro climatic phenomena and the influence of local meteorological circulation the depleted δ18o values gradually expand all over this part of the island in agreement with the hydroclimatic conditions at this time with a clear marking on the steepest slopes and on mountains this combined effect of microclimate and local atmospheric circulation is also identified in september and november in september the atmosphere is still relatively hot after the summer and the isotope depletion of rainfall is progressive with the increase in altitude furthermore this altitudinal effect is more evident along the mountain ridge with the lowest value of isotope at a precise site corresponding to the highest mountain of the region however in november lowest precipitation isotope contents are predicted in many areas along the mountainous chain this can be explained by the fact that the prediction is based on the relationships vapour pressure δ18o and slope δ18o moreover at this time the humidity has increased and expanded throughout the region and peculiarly in high reliefs in mam june and october the local meteorological circulation dominates everywhere whilst temperatures slightly rise after the winter peak in february the most depleted rainfall 21 of the year is predicted in march related to the highest isotopic gradient 0 39 100 m table 4 in djf the altitude effect was dampened by the slope actions in april and may the monthly isoscapes show significant changes according to the rainfall regime which shows a decrease of rainfall amount at this time highest values of δ18o are mainly observed at the coastal extremities of the island where lowest amounts of rainfall are recorded as the air becomes progressively dry in june the isotopic enrichment continues to extend to the whole region with δ18o values ranging from 4 to 10 the june map is similar to that of october fig 3 except that in october after the dry conditions of jja and even september the air becomes progressively humid and the predictions show isotopic values ranging from 6 to 12 microclimatic phenomena are mainly dominant in july and august fostered by the slope breeze mechanism the humid air moves from the top of the mountain towards the valleys allowing their cooling this phenomenon in addition to the reinforcement and weakness of eastern moisture and westerlies respectively leads to a positive altitudinal gradient and helps to explain the spatial distribution of δ18o at this period fig 4 however on the eastern side of the island as the slopes are well correlated to altitudes which have also a positive relationship with precipitation the influence of microclimate is not developed there the predicted map of precipitation isotopes is based on air temperatures precipitation and altitude distance from the sea therefore the spatial distribution of rainfall isotopes appears more homogeneous in this area with progressive isotopic depletion of rainfall from the coast to the high relief domain in the next section by analysing residual values a discussion will be proposed concerning the reliability of the developed model and on the processes associated to these residuals 4 4 influence of large scale controls highlighted by residual values residuals represent the difference between the observed isotopic values and those predicted by the model bowen and wilkinson 2002 the more the residuals are low the more the observed values are depleted than the predicted one their analysis help to evaluate the relevance of the model and also to associate other controls of precipitation isotopes in addition to those already identified by the isoscapes bowen and wilkinson 2002 giustini et al 2016 in this work monthly correlations between modelled and observed data show correlation coefficients ranging between 0 93 in february and june and 0 59 in december with a mean of 0 8 fig 5 thus isoscapes can explain up to 93 of the spatial variability of δ18o in rainfall for some months the differences between measured and modelled δ18o values was analysed for low 200 m a s l and high altitudes 200 m a s l in order to examine whether the altitude effect exacerbated the predicted depletion of rainfall isotopes residuals range between 2 88 to 1 76 and from 3 27 to 2 54 for high and low altitudes respectively similar to findings from giustini et al 2016 as well as sanchez murillo and birkel 2016 these differences regarding residual values appear similar in both coastal and elevated areas fig 6 globally the seasonal distribution of residuals in the high altitudes domain shows a monomodal trend with all values below zero residual values close to zero highlight the reliability of the model while low values indicate observed isotopes contents strongly more depleted than the predicted ones therefore the influence of slope breeze at this period of the year and the altitude effect are not sufficient to explain the depletion in precipitation isotopes in this specific context fig 6 for coastal areas seasonal distribution of residuals does not show a clear trend in contrast to elevated areas it shows highest values during the summer however in term of average values as for high altitudes predicted values are more depleted than those observed this means that in addition to continental effect and low rainfall recorded in this part of the region other factors would be involved in the control of coastal rainfall isotopes when excluding altitude or continental effect the action of slope breeze and the amount effect residuals obtained show that one or more local processes can contribute to depletion of the δ18o content in precipitation sea surface temperature relative humidity large bodies of surface water and atmospheric convection lachniet 2009 krklec et al 2018 yamanaka et al 2007 nlend et al 2020 all these mentioned parameters refer more or less to large scale systems and are known to have an influence on deuterium excess d excess indeed merlivat and jouzel 1979 highlighted a control of relative humidity in the region source of water vapour on d excess kurita 2013 risi et al 2013 and nlend et al 2020 show the link between continental recycling large scale meteorological systems and d excess here taking into account i the frontal systems characterizing the climate dynamic of the region bruno et al 2001 lambert and argence 2008 knerr et al 2020 ii the partial link observed between local precipitation amount and stable isotopes table 5 and iii the considerable depleted values of precipitation δ18o not totally linked to local controls revealed by residuals it is hypothesized a control of large meteorological systems to investigate such influences it is a proposed to test correlations between residuals and d excess as already carried out by giustini et al 2016 in italy fig 5 shows substantial positive correlation between deuterium excess and δ18o residuals for the months of january february march and august the more the deuterium excess increases the more δ18o residuals become positive reflecting a slight enrichment in measured precipitation isotopes fig 7 this positive relationship although not clearly understood has already been observed in meteorological systems associated to thunderstorms guan et al 2013 xie et al 2011 sánchez murillo et al 2019 it is consistent with the regional climatological literature bruno et al 2001 lambert and argence 2008 knerr et al 2020 reporting frontal systems in january february and thunderstorms in august on the other hand high degree of negative correlation between deuterium excess and residuals are observed in april june and september thus for these months the more residuals are negative reflecting low observed δ18o not related to orographic effect the more deuterium excess increases this is the well known case also presented by risi et al 2008 and kurita 2013 suggesting an influence of upstream convection taking into account the work of ruiz leo et al 2013 along the spanish mediterranean coast convective events should dominate in summer and autumn while fraction of stratiform events are more important in spring the results obtained here are not far to this analysis relative high δ18o and d excess refer to convective events while low δ18o may correspond to stratiform rainfall indeed stratiform precipitation is fed by moisture above the freezing level which has low δ18o values whereas the boundary layer moisture feeding convective precipitation is generally more enriched in 18o aggarwal et al 2016 sánchez murillo et al 2019 however a detailed analysis cannot be provided at this scale likewise for the six other months february may july october november and december which do not display any relationship with deuterium excess daily scale investigations and use of outgoing longwave radiation olr can help to quantify the relative importance of each factor controlling δ18o in precipitation and mainly to confirm or not the background influence of large scale convective systems nevertheless as a general consideration local controls such as precipitation amount and orographic effect does not seem to be the main factor depleting oxygen isotope composition of precipitation isoscapes therefore contribute to a better understanding of climatological circulation in regions with complex topography 5 conclusion this study presents describes and interprets a long term dataset provided by a regional isotopic network of precipitation isotopes in an area with steep relief on the basis of monthly isoscapes it provides information on the main factors controlling spatial distribution of rainfall isotopes in these areas isoscapes sometimes revealed unexpected results such as positive altitudinal gradient the depletion in stable isotopes is partially related to temperature and or precipitation rather than a predominant control of large scale atmospheric circulation over local precipitation as documented in some other regions by integrating specific topographic parameters such as slope in the model the study findings highlight a contribution of local scale atmospheric due to topographic forcing dynamics on precipitation isotopes this is symbolized for example by air exchanges between mountains and valleys which heat up or cool down very slowly compared to other places these results in terms of climate circulation can be generalized to all the areas with complex geomorphology for hydrological and hydrogeological studies they are useful since they represent valuable information on the input function to aquifer systems and surface water beside the predicted values analysis of residuals shows that the model still needs to achieve a better fit with ground truth this will be possible through a downscaling approach aiming to integrate a range of parameters linked to microclimate scale and through a representativeness of various altitudinal stages in the field in addition detailed study at small scales will be important to discriminate quantitatively the contribution of local and regional controls over the isotopic composition of precipitation at different periods such study will provide information

2513,while studies of the spatial distribution of precipitation isotope contents is well known at large scale and for more or less homogeneous areas regions with complex topography and aerology are more sparsely or not at all documented the aim of this research is to understand the factors influencing spatial temporal changes of isotopes content in rainfall over a heterogeneous region the region presents strong topographic contrasts an insular context with varied weather exposure and subsequent microclimates the approach consists in building isotopes landscapes isoscapes for different months taking advantage of the 7 year long monthly monitoring survey of the corsica network for isotopes in precipitation cnip corsica france isoscapes use linear predictions based on multiple regressions of station based precipitation isotope climatic and topographic data these regressions reveal the controlling effect of altitude with a dichotomous pattern observed between the winter and the summer periods and slope while meteorological settings partially influence isotope contents by explaining 88 of the δ18o spatial variability isoscapes highlight both a controlling effect of local scale meteorological circulation and a contribution of micro scale dynamics due to topographic forcing on the precipitation isotopes content the analysis of residual values revealed that these two effects are not sufficient to explain the depletion in heavy isotopes the deuterium excess was used to investigate the influence of large scale meteorological systems taking into account previous meteorological investigation it was possible for the first time to hypothesize an influence of types of precipitation convective or stratiform on the rainwater isotopic composition in the study region finally these results appear as evidence of the climate complexity in areas with steep reliefs and a potential limitation for generating reliable isoscapes in mediterranean regions they also demonstrate the role that isoscapes can play in documenting the microclimate processes in the world keywords stable isotopes rainfall microclimate mapping corsica mediterranean region data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction through the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea 2008 and several national regional monitoring programs information on factors influencing isotopes in rainfall is relatively well understood thereby advancing climate research gat and carmi 1970 lorius and merlivat 1977 siegenthaler and oeschger 1980 förstel and hützen 1982 datta et al 1991 celle jeanton et al 2001 stumpp et al 2014 giustini et al 2016 chen et al 2017 however over several decades there has been strong demand for accurate spatio temporal predictions of point regional and continental scale isotope values in precipitation this demand for isotope prediction arose from the ecological wildlife food source traceability and forensic sciences after it was revealed that the 2h and 18o values of some plant animal and human tissues closely mirrored isotopic patterns of precipitation hobson and wassenaar 1997 bowen et al 2005 this is especially important for regions that are poorly or not covered by observational data moreover if the spatial distribution pattern of isotope contents is well known at large scale and for more or less homogeneous areas the same is not the case for much more complex physiographic situations involving strong topographic contrasts island contexts under multiple weather exposure and or involving microclimates in this respect corsica island france western mediterranean represents a unique hydroclimatic and topographic context which makes it an interesting site for studying the distribution of isotopes in heterogeneous regions it is an area combining various geomorphological domains and has often been described by geographers as a mountain in the sea rome and giorgetti 2008 on the basis of temporal and spatial rainfall isotope content coverage from the corsica network for isotopes in precipitation cnip established in 2013 the aim of this study is to propose the isotope landscape isoscape west et al 2010 i e maps of spatial isotopic variation of stable isotopes in precipitation of this region for the different months it is worth noting that spatial precipitation isotope distribution patterns can lead to improved understanding of large scale water cycle dynamics and surface atmosphere vapour fluxes salati et al 1979 gat et al 2003 worden et al 2007 noone and sturm 2010 in addition maps of spatial variations in precipitation isotope ratios will be useful for surface and sub surface hydrology studies allowing partitioning of water origins fekete et al 2006 bowen et al 2007 wassenaar et al 2011 bedaso wu 2020 mattei et al 2021 by working on the physiographically contrasted island of corsica 8 722 km2 composed of a mountain range up to 2706 m asl separating a succession of parallel valleys on either side steeper to the west and leading to a vast plain on the eastern side the challenge here is to develop a model at small scale previous studies have mainly been conducted at global van der veer et al 2009 bowen 2010 and country e g wassenaar et al 2009 delavau et al 2011 scale although the regionalized cluster based water isotope prediction rcwip approach for predictive rainfall isotopes terzer et al 2013 terzer et al 2021 outperformed that of bowen bowen and wilkinson 2002 bowen and revenaugh 2003 with 67 of reliability when compared to observed data this method remains difficult to apply at small scale requiring a minimum of 15 stations for each climatic zone the aim of the downscaling approach proposed here is to capture and integrate various topographic and meteorological settings in order to enable a good an accurate a detailed examination of specific microclimate effects on isotopes while similar study has been performed in latin america for instance covering the pacific region e g sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 the mediterranean domain is still lacking large spatial isotopic investigation of hydro climatic conditions however it is one of the world s hot spots of climate change where forecasted global warming and dryness are likely to greatly affect the environment and human activities ipcc 2007 pachauri et al 2014 therefore this work is supposed to be a reference and could be easily applied especially for territories with steep relief in other mediterranean region furthermore the complex relief of corsica will provide a basis for discussion of the accuracy of predictions in mountains compared to lowland areas such studies are well known to i contribute to improve understanding in climate circulation e g vachon et al 2010 baisden et al 2016 shi et al 2020 ii highlight the link between meteroric water groundwater and surface water e g sánchez murillo and birkel 2016 bedaso and wu 2020 cole and boutt 2021 and even to iii develop proxies for geographic locations of fauna and humans e g reynard et al 2020 the investigations are primarily based on the understanding of geomorphological aspects and the main hydroclimatic features of the study area the corsica network of isotopes in precipitation cnip and the sampling strategy are presented and then the model developed to construct the isoscapes it is worth noting that the cnip is certainly the most long standing one with the longest continuous records in the mediterranean domain the results are beneficial for understanding the climate variability in this worldwide hotspot of climate change ipcc 2007 pachauri et al 2014 in addition the monthly isoscapes are expected to provide an assessment of the control exerted by topographic and climatic variables on precipitation isotopes what the iscoscapes reveal in terms of climate circulation is also discussed with regard to deuterium excess and residual values from the model the paper ends with some recommendations for further improvement of the model especially in high relief domains and outlines the perspectives concerning the implications of the obtained results for atmospheric and hydrological studies 2 study area main hydroclimatic features with a surface area of 8722 km2 and an average altitude of 568 m corsica is respectively the fourth largest and the most mountainous island in the mediterranean region a steep and rugged mountain ridge traverses the island from north to south including altitudes up to 2706 m above sea level a s l with more than twenty peaks exceeding 2000 m a s l fig 1 according to bruno et al 2001 54 of the island is at an altitude above 400 m a s l and almost 20 of its surface exceeds 1000 m a s l in the western and northern parts of the island several high mountain ridges extend close to the coastline breached by valleys oriented in the southwest to northeast direction reaching far inland in contrast the eastern part of the island is characterized by valleys stretching over the coastal plain fig 1 this geomorphological contrast between the eastern and western sides of the island is also marked by the slopes respectively gentle and steep in this topographically complex area a particular heterogeneous distribution of precipitation patterns is observed bruno et al 2001 knerr et al 2020 from the coastal zone to the inner island the annual rainfall varies from 500 to 2000 mm year with autumn and winter seasons accounting for most of the precipitation the amount of precipitation decreases progressively during the spring period and the summer months are very dry supplementary material 1 however violent summer rainstorms can occur and lead to considerable runoff flow rates in streams and rivers due to the steep slopes and the very short reaction times of the watersheds brigode et al 2019 the seasonal variation of air temperatures shows a negative correlation with this precipitation regime the annual sunshine rate is one the highest in mediterranean region with mean values of 22 29 31 and 19 days respectively for winter spring summer and autumn bruno et al 2001 however this climatic parameter is very heterogeneous spatially depending on the slope exposure overall given this context latitudinal location and its altitudinal range the climate of corsica ranges from subtropical conditions hot summers characterized by temperatures above 22 c and relatively short winters with average temperatures around 10 c in the lowlands to alpine conditions in the mountains characterized by snowfall during the winter bruno et al 2001 knerr et al 2020 concerning the regional atmospheric circulations extratropical westerlies in the mediterranean region strongly affect the precipitation dynamics e g dayan et al 2015 westerlies dominate the winter season december to february djf contrasting with dry summers june to august jja in djf extratropical westerlies transport the water vapour from the atlantic to the mediterranean associated with cyclones and frontal precipitation in contrast during jja the synoptic forcing is rather weak without any cyclonic activity from the west while sea slope breezes predominate for onshore moisture transport burlando et al 2008 furberg et al 2002 the establishment of storms or cyclonic events is especially observed after the summer during the autumn months when the sea surface temperature is very high often leading to high precipitation events hpes lambert and argence 2008 scheffknecht et al 2017 show that more than half of the hpes occur from september to december and almost 20 in october the most active month the eastern half of the island is most affected by hpes scheffknecht et al 2017 the latter are generally associated with strong advections of humid low level air blocked by the orography in addition in term of moisture source at large scale juhlke et al 2020 by using hysplit backward trajectory highlighted the dominance of mediterranean sea followed by western europe and atlantic ocean the control exerted by topography on the local climate in the region is very significant it has been pointed out that the topography also leads to small scale breeze systems which modify the large scale precipitation patterns in the mediterranean gao et al 2006 and particularly in corsica knerr et al 2020 in addition to westerlies and breeze effects the influence of winds from eastern europe has also to be considered and sometimes different types of circulation can combine together bruno et al 2001 juhlke et al 2020 fig 1 summarizes the different aspects of this atmospheric circulation with warm in autumn or cool in winter south easterly winds and westerlies through to large scale atlantic cyclones 3 materials and methods 3 1 rainfall sampling and isotope analysis monthly rainfall sampling was carried out from 2013 to 2019 in the framework of the cnip network which consists in 10 stations scattered over the island territory where stable isotopes of the water molecule are measured monthly on a totalized sample it represents nowadays one of the densest records of precipitation isotope observational data in the mediterranean region the ten stations fig 1 and table 1 are evenly distributed throughout the island with five coastal sites bastia ile rousse ajaccio bonifacio and aleria and five inner stations pirio corte campana palneca and capanella for each station meteorological data monthly precipitation and air temperature were obtained from meteo france https donneespubliques meteofrance fr palmex rainfall collectors were implanted according to iaea recommendations iaea gnip 2014 each station is sampled at the end of the month taking care to avoid any evaporation effect water is collected in 50 ml amber glass bottles and analysed at the hydrogeology department of the university of corsica cnrs umr 6134 spe for 18o and 2h analyses were performed by a dlt 100 laser based liquid vapour stable isotope analyser according to the analytical procedure recommended by the international atomic energy agency penna et al 2010 the analytical precision was better than 0 5 for δ2h and 0 2 for δ18o the ratio of isotopes rsample is given in the delta notation as δ value which is the relative deviation of the sample from a standard rstandard 1 δ r sample r standard r standard x 1000 where rsample and rstandard are isotope ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o v smow vienna standard mean ocean water was used as the reference standard for both 18o and 2h later on in the article there will be a focus on oxygen 18 especially for mapping since deuterium and oxygen 18 have the same physical properties and they are abide by the same isotopic fractionation laws fontes 1976 3 2 isoscape building the developed model inspired from terzer et al 2013 uses linear predictions based on multiple regressions of station based precipitation isotope climatic and topographic data the correlations between δ18o and spatial parameters for each station were determined by using long term average weighted mean for δ18oweighted equation 2 of each month for this calculation it was necessary to take into account the geomorphological differences between the western and eastern sides of corsica the parameters considered are elevation degree of slope and the distance from the sea the link between meteorological settings amount of precipitation air temperature vapour pressure and rainfall isotopes was assessed on the basis of long term data gathered for each sampling month fig 2 shows a simplified description of this approach which is inspired by terzer et al 2013 integrating new spatial settings but without climatic zone clustering 2 δ weighted δ i p i p i 3 2 1 gridded data sets meteorological data mean monthly precipitation air temperature and vapour pressure were extracted from the french weather service model safran durand et al 1993 durand et al 1999 which provides daily weather data for a 8 km

meteorological organization wmo 2008 the altitude values used in this paper come from the dem data provided by the ign french national institute of geographic and forest information https geoservices

combinations of the above mentioned variables which are accessible and can easily be considered as indicators of small and large scale atmospheric circulation therefore for a given month the general

parameters precipitation amount air temperature altitude etc showing best fit relationship with isotopes the best fit combinations were selected if they met an acceptance criterion of r 0 6 however if no suitable regression equation satisfying the acceptance criteria was obtained for a given month the global best fit regression equation for the corresponding month was applied by default to the month 3 2 3 co kriging the best regressions obtained were interpolated onto the gridded surface by means of co kriging with parameters climatic and or spatial fitting the acceptance criteria the co kriging on arc gis software provided a robust geostatistical interpolation method exploiting the spatial autocorrelation of natural features delhomme 1978 this function was based on the classic variogram model which describes the degree of spatial dependence of different points cressie 1993 bowen 2010 terzer et al 2013 4 results and discussion 4 1 general patterns table 1 shows the weighted mean signature for stable isotopes of the water molecule in precipitation of each sampling station in corsica likewise long term mean data of precipitation and temperature are presented in this table and monthly averaged values of each sites are shown in supplementary material 2 coastal sites having altitudes ranging from 0 to 99 m a s l show annual rainfall amounts ranging from 613 3 mm to 905 5 mm while yearly temperatures vary from 16 c to 17 6 c thus the hotest site is aléria which has the lowest record of rainfall and the highest annual temperature table 1 the station of bastia is the most distinct close to sea level it exhibits annual rainfall approximately equal to 900 mm considerably higher than that recorded elsewhere in coastal areas of the island this high humidity in the eastern side not mainly exposed to humid winds may be associated with a strong maritime influence moreover the ns direction of the cap corse chain north of bastia fig 1 can also help to explain this behaviour according to bruno et al 2001 when the air mass crosses the mountains under the influence of a strong gradient significant showers can occur on the opposite slope for inland stations with altitudes ranging from 184 to 1675 m a s l the precipitation varies between 830 8 mm and 1700 mm while temperatures range from 8 1 to 16 c it is clear for these stations that the more the altitude increases the more the rainfall increases and the air temperature decreases this pattern is not normally observed in terms of isotopes the most enriched δ2h and δ18o weighted means are observed at bastia 0 m a s l and the most depleted at capanella 1675 m a s l the non linearity between altitude and rainfall isotopes is highlighted for instance between pirio 184 m a s l and corte 429 m a s l the first despite its low elevation is more depleted than the second more elevated fig 3 this shows the complexity of the distribution of rainfall isotopes in the region and implies that in addition to the classical well known parameters such as rainfall and altitude other factors can control the spatial distribution of precipitation stable isotopes the local meteoric water line lmwl determined by using precipitation weighted least squares regression pwlsr hughes and crawford 2012 at a regional level and considering all monthly data from the sampling period at all sampling sites n 759 r2 0 80 defines the corsica meteoric water line cmwl as follows 4 δ 2 h 8 00 0 03 δ 18 o 13 30 0 15 it is very close to that obtained by celle 2000 for the western mediterranean zone δ2h 8 δ18o 14 the obtained deuterium excess reflects the main atlantic fingerprint deuterium excess of 10 and the secondary influence of the eastern mediterranean deuterium excess of 22 gat and carmi 1970 on corsican precipitation in good agreement with the regional air mass circulation dynamics pattern however by analysing each station of the cnip all individual lmwls indicate smaller slopes and intercept compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 rozanski et al 1993 and the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl celle 2000 the high variability of the lmwls tends to indicate that the isotopic signature of rainfall is unique for each individual station according to its location proximity to the sea elevation position in relation to the air mass trajectory etc or the influence of a parameter does not remain proportional from one station to another slopes and intercepts range from 6 12 to 7 54 and 2 97 to 8 69 respectively table 1 these lower slopes under 8 0 indicate secondary evaporation which occurs after condensation as raindrops fall through a dry air column imparting kinetic fractionation on the drops themselves dansgaard 1964 this effect is well known in the mediterranean context celle et al 2000 giustini et al 2016 and has already been documented in corsica by van geldern et al 2014 and santoni et al 2018 the high rate of evaporation in the mediterranean and the hottest conditions recorded in this area lionello 2012 are elements to take into consideration to explain this phenomenon this is especially true as it is observed that the lowest slope corresponds to the least rainy areas with a mediterranean climate and the highest slopes to the most humid zones which correspond to alpine climate domains table 1 furthermore it is worth noting that for areas with approximately the same mean annual rainfall there is a significant difference in terms of slope depending on the location by considering only stations lower than 600 m a s l in order to minimize topographic effects the results show that the stations on the western side of the mountains have generally steeper slopes mean of 7 20 than those on the eastern side mean of 6 85 this can be explained by the fact that the western side of the island is more exposed to humid air masses coming from the atlantic ocean and due to a foehn effect the stations on the eastern side are generally less watered in the same way evaporation and other local parameters rainfall amount elevation air temperature all influence the values of the intercept d on the eastern side d varies from 2 97 to 8 40 with a mean of 6 and from 5 00 to 8 06 with an average of 6 85 for western stations generally lower intercepts are associated with less precipitation and higher temperatures indicating secondary evaporation effects during rainout dansgaard 1964 similarly this spatial pattern of slopes and d intercept of lmwls was also observed in italy longinelli and selmo 2003 and giustini et al 2016 and germany stumpp et al 2014 where authors recorded an increase in slope and deuterium excess from coast to inland in italy and increase in slope from west to east for stations 200 m a sl in germany a spatial homogeneity of station distribution patterns can be observed for the cnip since positive correlation coefficients are observed everywhere in the matrix for isotopic composition in precipitation for each sampling station table 2 this means that the seasonal variation of δ18o is generally consistent over the island however on the other hand the fact that significant correlations are observed between stations from different sides of the island and different altitudes highlights once again the complexity of the spatial distribution of precipitation isotopes over the study region 4 2 regression analysis local climate controls 4 2 1 control of the topography on precipitation isotopes in this section the influence of orography on the stable isotope composition of precipitation is assessed the geographical factors that have been considered are i the elevation ii the distance from the sea and iii the slope of the terrain elevation and distance from the sea are strongly correlated on the western r 0 96 and eastern r 0 88 sides of the island concerning the slopes they are well correlated with altitudes in the east r 0 90 while their relationships with altitudes are partial r 0 50 for western stations the slopes in this context of complex topography would be associated with microclimatic phenomena related to slope and valley breezes mechanisms orography is known to modulate the effect of both larger weather systems e g frontal systems and regional circulation breeze systems on the land surface fernandez et al 2003 smith et al 2012 as described in section 3 the regression coefficients showing the link between these spatial parameters and precipitation δ18o are shown in table 3 the analysis was carried out by discriminating the two sides of the island regarding the geomorphological differences observed between them and also reflected on lmwls as highlighted in the previous section 4 2 2 altitude effect monthly correlation coefficients r for altitude versus δ18o range between 0 99 and 0 36 for western stations while they vary from 0 93 to 0 27 for eastern stations table 3 thus globally the δ18o values become depleted with increasing altitude as expected by the rayleigh distillation process of water vapour as air masses rise and cool gonfiantini et al 2001 kern et al 2020 however regarding the wide range of r this altitude effect varies considerably from one month to another highlighting the probable influence of other parameters moreover as expected significant differences in term of isotopes depletion have been observed between the west and the east of the island on the western side the depletion due to altitude effect is more exacerbated in djf winter and mam spring while the link between δ18o and elevation is weak for summer jja and autumn son months in august instead of depletion an enrichment in isotopes is rather observed with an increase in altitude table 3 however for the eastern side the relationship between precipitation δ18o and altitude is reinforced in summer and autumn with low correlation coefficients recorded in djf therefore for the both sides of the island it is worth noting that the spatial distribution of rainfall isotopes shows different behaviours according to the seasons the contrasted pattern observed between the winter and the summer periods can be explained by the fact that in jja the vertical atmospheric mixing height is more important than other months limiting the isotope depletion with elevation according to kern et al 2014 who worked in the swiss alpine domain furthermore in jja the western slope may act as a leeward slope due to water vapour coming from the tyrrhenian side as westerlies are absent this can also explain the contrast observed between the two seasons and especially the difference recorded from one side to the other during the summer the tyrrhenian side of the island is more exposed to humid winds while in djf there is a dominance of westerlies and the tyrrhenian side of corsica corresponds to a leeward slope leading to a weak relationship between altitudes and δ18o at this time this phenomenon also observed in the high relief domains of adriatic pannonian region northern plateau of mexico and canadian rocky mountains moran 2007 quezadas et al 2021 kern et al 2020 can explain the unexpected positive correlation between δ18o and altitudes in august which is probably accentuated by breeze effects when the bottom of the valleys is colder than the tops of the slope the isotopic gradients determined for each month table 4 show less variation on the homogeneous eastern side compared to the steeper western slope monthly isotopic lapse rates range from 0 39 100 m to 0 04 100 m with a mean of 0 20 and from 0 25 100 m to 0 06 100 m with a mean of 0 14 100 m for the western and eastern sides of the island respectively table 4 a gradient of 0 20 100 m is very close to the mean value of the vertical gradients measured on the adriatic side of the italian peninsula hauser et al 1980 grassa et al 2006 liotta et al 2013 giustini et al 2016 in different regions of the alps pearson et al 1991 ofterdinger et al 2004 kralik et al 2003 and in tropical mountains of south america gonfiantini et al 2001 sánchez murillo et al 2020 however the value of 0 14 obtained for eastern stations is similar to that of the tyrrhenian side of italy giustini et al 2016 4 2 3 influence of slopes the control of topography over precipitation isotopes is confirmed when looking at the relationship between the slopes of the terrain and isotopes values generally the steeper the slope of the terrain is the more the isotope content will be depleted table 3 this is particularly true for the western part of corsica which is more steeply sloping featuring very deep valleys where the air masses often remain engulfed the rainfall isotopes decrease strongly with the slope in djf while in july august and november they increase strongly with the slope table 4 therefore when the altitude effect is insufficient to explain the isotope depletion the control exerted by the slope is evident the non linear relationship between elevation and precipitation on δ18o can be related to the slope of the terrain this can explain for example why a low elevated inland station such as pirio exhibits lower contents in isotopes compared to more elevated stations table 1 for the tyrrhenian side the correlation coefficients between slopes and δ18o are almost identical to those for altitude versus δ18o in this homogeneous area in term of geomorphology the slopes are well superimposed on altitudes and the relationships with precipitation isotopes are similar 4 2 4 continental effect concerning the distance from the sea as it is strongly associated with altitude the relationships with δ18o in precipitation are similar to that observed between δ18o and elevation therefore in this paper continental and altitude effects are related with each other with very similar correlation coefficients for each month table 3 in summary the strong influence of spatial parameters on isotopic contents of precipitation highlights the orographic forcing on the local climate certainly leading to the development of microclimates 4 2 5 control of meteorological parameters over precipitation isotopes the monthly correlation coefficients between δ18o and major meteorological parameters air temperature precipitation and vapour pressure are shown in table 5 4 2 6 temperature effect the δ18o value shows a partial dependence 0 22 r 0 69 on air temperature this is in good agreement with the temperature effect observed at mid and high latitude regions iaea 2000 vystavna et al 2021 however a r 0 6 is only observed in february when the lowest temperatures are recorded thus compared to intermediate and warm temperatures precipitation isotopes distribution is more impacted by cold temperatures forcing which induces considerable depletion in stable isotopes indeed fractionation is greater at lower temperatures in the atmosphere dansgaard 1964 4 2 7 precipitation amount effect concerning the precipitation amount effect the relationship between precipitation amount and δ18o is negative for each month nevertheless the amount effect appears to be highest in march r 0 62 and in october r 0 70 when there are frontal passages of air masses and intense cyclonic activity bruno et al 2001 the partial influence of air temperature and rainfall the two local meteorological parameters characterizing the seasons is an indication that rather than a local atmospheric dynamic it is large scale meteorological events that can affect isotope contents this has been shown for instance in western central africa risi et al 2008 nlend et al 2020 south america vuille and wermer 2005 samuels crow et al 2014 and china he et al 2015 yu et al 2016 gao et al 2018 4 2 8 vapour pressure control a significant p 0 05 positive correlation is apparent between δ18o and vapour pressure for each month table 5 however a strong relationship r 0 6 is only observed for the month of february the higher the vapour pressure the more the isotope content in precipitation is high this relationship observed for february and even all along the year is not in good agreement with information from literature indeed the fractionation is greater at lower temperatures in the atmosphere dansgaard 1964 merlivat and jouzel 1979 yu et al 2006 in summary based on long term monitoring of rainfall isotopes from the cnip an assessment of the influence of meteorological and topographic parameters on precipitation isotopic signature was conducted stronger control over precipitation isotopes exerted by altitude and slope is highlighted rather than a strong influence of the meteorological parameters the influence of slope is more highlighted to the west where the relief is steep this parameter which reflects the deepness of valleys is supposed to favour microclimatic conditions at a given site the partial control of local meteorological parameters involves a stronger dominance of a large scale atmospheric dynamic over local precipitation isotopes on the basis of these results the next section will propose a predictive map of δ18o spatial distribution which will be useful to have a first appreciation of the control of large scale local and micro scale climatic phenomena 4 3 corsica monthly δ18o isoscapes based on best relationships tables 4 and 5 optimal multi linear regressions were used to establish accurate isoscapes fig 4 on these maps various spatial patterns of precipitation δ18o can be observed indicating a clear seasonal effect on isotope variations the specific sites with higher and lower isotope contents all year round are also highlighted regarding the contrasts observed between the west and the east isoscapes were built separately for each side of the study region it was assumed that the slope of the terrain relates to micro scale as explained above and precipitation which generally increases with altitude distance from the sea corresponds to local climate circulation in djf for the western zone the parameters considered for isotope prediction are altitude distance from the sea precipitation water vapour and slope therefore this implies for these months a combination of micro climatic phenomena and the influence of local meteorological circulation the depleted δ18o values gradually expand all over this part of the island in agreement with the hydroclimatic conditions at this time with a clear marking on the steepest slopes and on mountains this combined effect of microclimate and local atmospheric circulation is also identified in september and november in september the atmosphere is still relatively hot after the summer and the isotope depletion of rainfall is progressive with the increase in altitude furthermore this altitudinal effect is more evident along the mountain ridge with the lowest value of isotope at a precise site corresponding to the highest mountain of the region however in november lowest precipitation isotope contents are predicted in many areas along the mountainous chain this can be explained by the fact that the prediction is based on the relationships vapour pressure δ18o and slope δ18o moreover at this time the humidity has increased and expanded throughout the region and peculiarly in high reliefs in mam june and october the local meteorological circulation dominates everywhere whilst temperatures slightly rise after the winter peak in february the most depleted rainfall 21 of the year is predicted in march related to the highest isotopic gradient 0 39 100 m table 4 in djf the altitude effect was dampened by the slope actions in april and may the monthly isoscapes show significant changes according to the rainfall regime which shows a decrease of rainfall amount at this time highest values of δ18o are mainly observed at the coastal extremities of the island where lowest amounts of rainfall are recorded as the air becomes progressively dry in june the isotopic enrichment continues to extend to the whole region with δ18o values ranging from 4 to 10 the june map is similar to that of october fig 3 except that in october after the dry conditions of jja and even september the air becomes progressively humid and the predictions show isotopic values ranging from 6 to 12 microclimatic phenomena are mainly dominant in july and august fostered by the slope breeze mechanism the humid air moves from the top of the mountain towards the valleys allowing their cooling this phenomenon in addition to the reinforcement and weakness of eastern moisture and westerlies respectively leads to a positive altitudinal gradient and helps to explain the spatial distribution of δ18o at this period fig 4 however on the eastern side of the island as the slopes are well correlated to altitudes which have also a positive relationship with precipitation the influence of microclimate is not developed there the predicted map of precipitation isotopes is based on air temperatures precipitation and altitude distance from the sea therefore the spatial distribution of rainfall isotopes appears more homogeneous in this area with progressive isotopic depletion of rainfall from the coast to the high relief domain in the next section by analysing residual values a discussion will be proposed concerning the reliability of the developed model and on the processes associated to these residuals 4 4 influence of large scale controls highlighted by residual values residuals represent the difference between the observed isotopic values and those predicted by the model bowen and wilkinson 2002 the more the residuals are low the more the observed values are depleted than the predicted one their analysis help to evaluate the relevance of the model and also to associate other controls of precipitation isotopes in addition to those already identified by the isoscapes bowen and wilkinson 2002 giustini et al 2016 in this work monthly correlations between modelled and observed data show correlation coefficients ranging between 0 93 in february and june and 0 59 in december with a mean of 0 8 fig 5 thus isoscapes can explain up to 93 of the spatial variability of δ18o in rainfall for some months the differences between measured and modelled δ18o values was analysed for low 200 m a s l and high altitudes 200 m a s l in order to examine whether the altitude effect exacerbated the predicted depletion of rainfall isotopes residuals range between 2 88 to 1 76 and from 3 27 to 2 54 for high and low altitudes respectively similar to findings from giustini et al 2016 as well as sanchez murillo and birkel 2016 these differences regarding residual values appear similar in both coastal and elevated areas fig 6 globally the seasonal distribution of residuals in the high altitudes domain shows a monomodal trend with all values below zero residual values close to zero highlight the reliability of the model while low values indicate observed isotopes contents strongly more depleted than the predicted ones therefore the influence of slope breeze at this period of the year and the altitude effect are not sufficient to explain the depletion in precipitation isotopes in this specific context fig 6 for coastal areas seasonal distribution of residuals does not show a clear trend in contrast to elevated areas it shows highest values during the summer however in term of average values as for high altitudes predicted values are more depleted than those observed this means that in addition to continental effect and low rainfall recorded in this part of the region other factors would be involved in the control of coastal rainfall isotopes when excluding altitude or continental effect the action of slope breeze and the amount effect residuals obtained show that one or more local processes can contribute to depletion of the δ18o content in precipitation sea surface temperature relative humidity large bodies of surface water and atmospheric convection lachniet 2009 krklec et al 2018 yamanaka et al 2007 nlend et al 2020 all these mentioned parameters refer more or less to large scale systems and are known to have an influence on deuterium excess d excess indeed merlivat and jouzel 1979 highlighted a control of relative humidity in the region source of water vapour on d excess kurita 2013 risi et al 2013 and nlend et al 2020 show the link between continental recycling large scale meteorological systems and d excess here taking into account i the frontal systems characterizing the climate dynamic of the region bruno et al 2001 lambert and argence 2008 knerr et al 2020 ii the partial link observed between local precipitation amount and stable isotopes table 5 and iii the considerable depleted values of precipitation δ18o not totally linked to local controls revealed by residuals it is hypothesized a control of large meteorological systems to investigate such influences it is a proposed to test correlations between residuals and d excess as already carried out by giustini et al 2016 in italy fig 5 shows substantial positive correlation between deuterium excess and δ18o residuals for the months of january february march and august the more the deuterium excess increases the more δ18o residuals become positive reflecting a slight enrichment in measured precipitation isotopes fig 7 this positive relationship although not clearly understood has already been observed in meteorological systems associated to thunderstorms guan et al 2013 xie et al 2011 sánchez murillo et al 2019 it is consistent with the regional climatological literature bruno et al 2001 lambert and argence 2008 knerr et al 2020 reporting frontal systems in january february and thunderstorms in august on the other hand high degree of negative correlation between deuterium excess and residuals are observed in april june and september thus for these months the more residuals are negative reflecting low observed δ18o not related to orographic effect the more deuterium excess increases this is the well known case also presented by risi et al 2008 and kurita 2013 suggesting an influence of upstream convection taking into account the work of ruiz leo et al 2013 along the spanish mediterranean coast convective events should dominate in summer and autumn while fraction of stratiform events are more important in spring the results obtained here are not far to this analysis relative high δ18o and d excess refer to convective events while low δ18o may correspond to stratiform rainfall indeed stratiform precipitation is fed by moisture above the freezing level which has low δ18o values whereas the boundary layer moisture feeding convective precipitation is generally more enriched in 18o aggarwal et al 2016 sánchez murillo et al 2019 however a detailed analysis cannot be provided at this scale likewise for the six other months february may july october november and december which do not display any relationship with deuterium excess daily scale investigations and use of outgoing longwave radiation olr can help to quantify the relative importance of each factor controlling δ18o in precipitation and mainly to confirm or not the background influence of large scale convective systems nevertheless as a general consideration local controls such as precipitation amount and orographic effect does not seem to be the main factor depleting oxygen isotope composition of precipitation isoscapes therefore contribute to a better understanding of climatological circulation in regions with complex topography 5 conclusion this study presents describes and interprets a long term dataset provided by a regional isotopic network of precipitation isotopes in an area with steep relief on the basis of monthly isoscapes it provides information on the main factors controlling spatial distribution of rainfall isotopes in these areas isoscapes sometimes revealed unexpected results such as positive altitudinal gradient the depletion in stable isotopes is partially related to temperature and or precipitation rather than a predominant control of large scale atmospheric circulation over local precipitation as documented in some other regions by integrating specific topographic parameters such as slope in the model the study findings highlight a contribution of local scale atmospheric due to topographic forcing dynamics on precipitation isotopes this is symbolized for example by air exchanges between mountains and valleys which heat up or cool down very slowly compared to other places these results in terms of climate circulation can be generalized to all the areas with complex geomorphology for hydrological and hydrogeological studies they are useful since they represent valuable information on the input function to aquifer systems and surface water beside the predicted values analysis of residuals shows that the model still needs to achieve a better fit with ground truth this will be possible through a downscaling approach aiming to integrate a range of parameters linked to microclimate scale and through a representativeness of various altitudinal stages in the field in addition detailed study at small scales will be important to discriminate quantitatively the contribution of local and regional controls over the isotopic composition of precipitation at different periods such study will provide information

2514,invasive trees in catchments around the world are a source of concern due to their hydrological and ecological impacts a large number of studies have focused on their impact on dry season stream discharge due to enhanced transpiration the impact of invasive trees on stream discharge and flood risk during extreme rain events which are becoming more frequent due to climate change has not been addressed adequately we examined the influence of land cover canopy cover and other catchment morphological characteristics on stream discharges in hilly catchments during light heavy and extreme rain events three years of rainfall runoff observations between january 2014 and december 2016 were collected in eleven neighbouring mountainous catchments in nilgiris south india each catchment had a distinct land cover namely shola forests montane grasslands and catchments invaded by wattle acacia mearnsii hourly rain intensities between the percentiles 25 90 90 95 and over 95 were categorised as light heavy and extreme respectively and were used to study hourly peak stream discharge responses we compared discharge between native grassland catchments and grassland catchments invaded by wattle discharge rates were corrected for the catchment area we found that land cover and canopy cover influenced the hydrologic response to extreme rain events regression models with flood event as the response variable suggested an increase in rainfall runoff response with an increase in canopy cover the maximum hourly discharge observed in the reference grassland catchment 0 00098 mm s 1 was lower than the maximum discharge observed in low density 0 00529 mm s 1 and high density 0 00497 mm s 1 wattle catchments at higher discharges the flood magnitude in wattle invaded catchments was much greater than that in the grassland catchment for a given flood frequency indicating a higher risk of severe flooding in wattle dominated catchments we attribute the enhanced flood discharges to the effects of spreading wattle roots on the enhancement of rapid shallow sub surface flows in invaded catchments catchments dominated by shallow sub surface flows are known to have reduced water retention times in response to high rain intensities antecedent moisture conditions and drainage density were other factors that influenced the local rainfall runoff relationships in the western ghats and other parts of india grasslands have been planted with exotic woody trees and some have become invasive our study indicates that replacing grasslands with woody plants at landscape scales could affect hydrological processes and could increase flood risks during the monsoon especially in mountainous regions management of invaded catchments by regulation of wattle and restoration of semi natural grassland combined with the installation of early warning systems in these impacted areas will help reduce flood risk during extreme rain under climate change keywords wattle western ghats

concern worldwide goswami et al 2006 guhathakurta et al 2011 mason et al 1999 osborn et al 2000 wehner et al 2021 zhou et al 2013 such extreme rain events ere often lead to destructive floods causing extensive loss of lives and property fowler and kilsby 2003 guhathakurta et al 2011 mishra and shah 2018 ranger et al 2011 during heavy rains the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils may be exceeded koutnỳ et al 2014 and apart from infiltration excess overland flow rapid sub surface pathways are activated bonell et al 2010 chappell et al 2017 resulting in higher and quicker discharge from the basin the problem is more serious in mountainous terrain where steep slopes accelerate the delivery of water to streams leading to a rapid discharge of water and sediments downstream serrano muela et al 2013 understanding the relationship between rainfall and discharge response of basins can help design mitigation strategies for destructive floods such relationships need to be studied at local scales as most water flow enters rivers via low order channels and is governed by catchment characteristics and micro climate borga et al 2014 a large number of local topographic and hydrologic

and antecedent moisture chappell et al 2017 haga et al 2005 kim et al 2019 ogden et al 2011 song and wang 2019 influence the rainfall runoff relationships vegetative cover often a human managed characteristic of the catchment also may play a significant role in mediating the rainfall runoff response vegetation can alter infiltration of precipitation into headwater soils koutnỳ et al 2014 certain types of vegetation add organic matter to the soil and thus enhance infiltration thereby decreasing the amount and velocity of overland flow and erosive forces bathurst et al 2011 koutnỳ et al 2014 krishnaswamy et al 2012 replacing native vegetation within grasslands with fast growing species such as eucalyptus and wattle may greatly increase both interception loss and transpiration and can reduce streamflows particularly during the dry season basappa et al 2014 calder and dye 2001 chand et al 2009 clulow et al 2011 dye and jarmain 2004 jackson et al 2005 prinsloo and scott 1999 samraj et al 1988 sharda et al 1988 sikka et al 2003 however the role of invasive alien trees on runoff responses to extreme rainfall events in the wet season is not adequately known relative to other functions and services that have been studied e g pejchar and mooney 2009 the nilgiris is part of the western ghats biodiversity hotspot and is known for its mosaic of high altitude montane rain forests sholas and grasslands a large number of exotic plants were introduced in these natural grasslands and sholas and some of these exotics particularly wattles acacia mearnsii and acacia dealbata have invaded natural grasslands joshi et al 2018 wattles are fast growing erect evergreen trees growing up to 10 m tall native to southeastern australia in native habitat where bushfires are common the wattle helps to bind together erosion prone soils quickly due to rapid growth rates nitrogen fixing abilities and development of large crowns wattles have managed to outcompete native vegetation and have invaded natural grasslands and shrublands in many parts of the world acacia mearnsii also known as black wattle is listed as one of the world s 100 most invasive alien plant species lowe et al 2000 van der weijden et al 2007 in south africa wattles have altered fire regime increased erosion reduced biodiversity and destabilised river banks adair 2002 de wit et al 2001 le maitre et al 1999 samways et al 1996 studies also suggest that compared to native vegetation wattles exhibit high evapotranspiration rates and high use of soil moisture throughout the year resulting in reduced streamflow dye et al 2001 dye and jarmain 2004 our preliminary study in this landscape also found a reduction in streamflow in wattle dominated catchments during the dry season bhalla et al 2015 however the role of wattle in influencing rainfall runoff relationships particularly during extreme rainfall events has not been established empirically in the nilgiris region rangan et al 2010 and this study tries to address this evidence gap the majority of studies on the hydrological impacts of wattle have focused on the interception loss and water consumption by wattle and conclude that wattle reduces streamflow however there are certain traits associated with wattle that could result in decreased or increased flood risks in wattle dominated landscapes wattles have a denser canopy cover compared with the native grasslands which could enhance interception loss and transpiration and thus reduce antecedent moisture at the start of flood events thereby resulting in reduced flood risks bathurst et al 2020 at the same time their litter may not integrate as well into the soil compared with native vegetation and thereby not aid infiltration resulting in increased overland flow over the mineral soil bonell et al 2010 a greater soil repellency is observed in areas under wattle cover compared with areas under native grassland and shrubs which is associated with a greater risk of overland flow on mountain slopes scott 2000 prior studies in the nilgiris suggest subsurface drainage networks dominate under wattle plantations chappell et al 2017 krishnaswamy et al 2017 consequently if wattle root systems increase lateral soil permeability this could in principle speed water to streams in extreme events in this study we compare the hydrologic response of natural grasslands and the introduced invasive wattle at different rainfall intensities we examine the relationship between hourly rainfall and the magnitude of peak discharge for the distribution of different rainfall events this analysis could help the government and communities to be alert to differences in behaviour of wattle and grassland catchments during extreme rainfall events 2 study area this study was conducted in the nilgiris reserve forest in the western ghats biodiversity hot spot myers et al 2000 in south india fig 1 the nilgiris or the blue mountains 76 77 15 e 11 15 12 15 n are part of the nilgiri biosphere reserve established in 1986 the first biosphere reserve in india daniels 1996 the nilgiris are home to 15 different indigenous tribes and harbour a large number of threatened and endemic species of flora and fauna daniels 1996 elevation in the nilgiris ranges from 1000 m to 2600 m asl which has given rise to diverse vegetation types such as montane rain forests in the valleys locally known as sholas interspersed by high altitude grasslands nilgiris forms an important catchment area for several perennial tributaries of the cauvery india wris 2020 including bhavani on which large human populations are dependent downstream these streams and rivers are managed extensively for power generation irrigation and drinking water through a chain of dams and reservoirs india reservoirs india wris 2020 in 2018 and 2019 several parts of the western ghats repeatedly experienced heavy rains and subsequent floods destroyed several villages and triggered a large number of landslides leading to the loss of many human lives and livelihoods menon 2019 mishra et al 2018 mishra and shah 2018 safi 2018 this study was located at avalanche in the nilgiris which was the epicentre of ere during august 2019 premkumar 2019 twc 2019 which washed away all the water level recorders used in this study floods and landslides in the western ghats have often been attributed to changes in land cover and land use over the last century vasantha kumar and bhagavanulu 2008 a large number of exotic plants were introduced in the natural grasslands and sholas and some of these exotics particularly wattles acacia mearnsii and acacia dealbata have invaded natural grasslands joshi et al 2018 rainfall and stream flows have been monitored at the study site since 2012 and it is one of the field research sites under the critical zone exploration network https www czen org content western ghats 3 methods 3 1 data collection we conducted our study in the 1000 km2 area of the nilgiris forest division which included 11 monitored catchments we collected and analysed three years of rainfall runoff data from january 2014 to december 2016 data from 2017 onwards was not used because a forest fire in the last two weeks of february 2017 had significantly altered the land cover of the region sriramamurthy et al 2020 we used tipping bucket rain gauges rainwise 2012 to measure rainfall we had 26 rain gauges placed in an approximate grid of one kilometre that recorded rainfall at one minute intervals ten of these were located within the study catchments we used the mean rainfall readings when two or more rain gauges were present in the same catchment water levels were measured at five minute intervals in eleven streams instrumented with stilling wells and capacitance water level recorders wlrs dataflow systems limited 2017 we converted stage values to discharge using rating curves developed through a combination of spot current meter gauging and slug injection salt dilution methods shaw et al 2010 spot current meters were used to measure stream velocity during low flows while salt dilution methods were employed to measure velocities at both low and high flows we used nearly 55 70 velocity readings obtained across three years to develop rating curves for each catchment the streams were low order 1 3 and the total catchment area covered was 1 200 ha digital elevation models obtained from srtm nasa jpl 2013 combined with high resolution imagery from google earth google earth 2019 earth google com web and field verification using gps units garmin etrex 10 were used to delineate the catchments we had a total of 11 monitored headwater catchments in the study area canopy cover is known to influence the runoff responses by intercepting and immediately evaporating a proportion of the rainfall as wet canopy evaporation or interception loss cui et al 2012 dye et al 2001 levia et al 2011 livesley et al 2014 hence we calculated median enhanced vegetation index evi which was used as a proxy for canopy cover henceforth referred to as canopy cover for each of the catchments evi was developed by using sentinel 2 images from the dry season of april 2016 esa 2016 based on field survey and evi we classified each of these catchments into three broad classes grasslands sholas and wattle dominated catchments however many of the grasslands had a varying level of invasion by wattle hence we further classified the catchments in to four categories based on land cover and wattle cover densities henceforth referred as land cover natural grasslands 90 grassland cover n 1 low density wattle grasslands with wattle cover ranging from 17 to 40 n 4 high density wattle 55 wattle cover n 4 and shola 80 montane forests n 2 table 1 we found a strong correlation r 0 96 between canopy cover and the land cover categories of the catchments four different morphological characteristics basin shape area steepness of the slopes and drainage density were derived for each of the catchments catchment shape was measured using the circularity index ci or ratio which could help forecasting the flood potential of a basin the ci is expressed as ci ab ac where ab is the area of the basin and ac is the area of a circle with the same length of perimeter as the basin allaby 2013 a layer of drainage networks was developed using the r watershed module in grass 7 grass development team 2018 drainage density was expressed as m m 2 for each catchment steepness of the catchment slope was also obtained using the r watershed module which generates a slope steepness factor as defined for the universal soil loss equation mccool et al 1987 the soil type was similar across all the catchments as per the national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss lup sehgal et al 1987 and is described as clayey skeletal mixed typic haplustalfs and typic ustropepts table 1 antecedent moisture conditions are known to influence rainfall runoff relationships chappell et al 2017 haga et al 2005 kim et al 2019 song and wang 2019 we therefore derived an antecedent moisture index ami which is an approximation of the moisture stored within a catchment before a particular rainfall event ami was developed by deducting total discharge from the cumulative rainfall over the 14 antecedent days or 14 24 h we found a strong correlation r 0 96 between this index and the widely used antecedent precipitation index api kohler and linsley 1951 developed using a decay constant k value of 0 9 and considering 14 antecedent days 3 2 analysis box and whisker plots and regression models were used to analyse discharge responses of different catchments at different hourly rainfall intensities and the influence of canopy cover dominant land cover type and other catchment morphological characteristics potentially pertinent to rainfall runoff response data processing and analysis was carried out using the r statistical software r core team 2019 all rainfall and discharge data were aggregated in to hourly datasets for each catchment discharge m3 s 1 was measured for each stream on a 5 minute interval and aggregated to give a time series of peak hourly discharge discharge was then divided by the area of the corresponding catchment to obtain hourly discharge per unit area and expressed as millimetres per second mm s 1 henceforth referred to as hourly discharges data from the dry season january to april was excluded from the analysis we collected a total of 257 776 h of data across 11 catchments the lag time between hourly rainfall and hourly peak discharge values was investigated using cross correlation function ccf available in r ccf helps in computing the correlation between hourly rainfall and discharge up to a defined lag to estimate the lag time we constructed an hourly dataset including only data where rain was observed on two or more consecutive days data from the first 24 h of such continuous rain time series were removed to reduce the influence of antecedent conditions on the lag time estimates discharge data representing up to 7 days of lag 7 24 h were constructed the lag time representing maximum correlation between hourly rainfall and hourly discharge was identified for each catchment using the maximum ccf value the discharge values corresponding to these lag times were used in all rainfall runoff analyses our final dataset comprised a total of 126 473 h of rainfall discharge data hourly rainfall across all the catchments was grouped into three rainfall intensities i low intensity rainfall light rain rainfall values below 90th percentile 4 75 mm h 1 ii heavy rain between 90th percentile and 95th percentile 4 75 mm h 1 and 7 45 mm h 1 and iii extreme rainfall 95th percentile and above 7 45 mm h 1 we calculated percentiles of all non zero hourly rainfall values between 1st may and 31st december from 2014 to 2016 box and whisker plots were used to examine the variability in discharge responses across different catchments and rainfall intensities for this we used canopy cover median evi in each catchment as an independent variable and lagged hourly discharge as the response variable we compared median lagged hourly discharge values of wattle invaded catchments with natural grassland at different rainfall totals using these plots we further analysed rainfall runoff relationships across catchments by fitting linear additive models using generalised least squares gls at different rainfall intensities the response variable was lagged hourly discharge data the predictor variables in the models included hourly rainfall ami pertaining up to that hour catchment canopy cover median evi and other morphometric characteristics catchment area shape steepness of the slopes and drainage density catchments dominated by shola land cover were excluded from the analysis as we were interested in understanding the changes caused by wattle invasion into the grasslands further as the grassland category had only one catchment we included only catchments that had varying levels of wattle cover low and high density wattle categories in the gls linear regression models variables introducing collinearity in the model were identified using the cross correlation table obtained while running gls regression analysis the gls model outputs suggested that the covariates catchment area shape and steepness of the slopes were highly correlated correlation 0 5 and hence were removed from the models the most plausible explanatory variables and the best model for describing variations in hourly discharges between catchments at different rainfall intensities were selected using akaike information criteria with bias adjustment aicc burnham and anderson 2002 the rainfall only model was used as a null model to compare the results model averaged coefficients full average were used whenever δaicc values of less than two were obtained to select the most plausible explanatory variables in addition to rainfall discharge analysis at different rainfall intensities we analysed the influence of various factors on flood events we defined flood events as hourly discharges that were greater than or equal to 95th percentile 0 00047 mm s 1 we used scatter plots and gls linear regression models on this data subset to explore the influence of land cover and other catchment morphological characteristics on rainfall flood events in addition to chronological pairing of rainfall discharge data we also used flood frequency paired plots to examine the impact of wattle cover on peak discharges ideally annual peak discharges are used to prepare flood frequency plots as we had only three years of data we constructed a flood frequency plot by using a time series of daily peak discharges the recurrence time days for different size of floods were derived by calculating exceedance probabilities gringorten 1963 the distribution of flood frequency curves across different catchments was compared to understand the influence of vegetation cover on peak discharges we also analysed the relationship between time lag between rainfall and peak discharge and other predictor variables using box and whisker plots and linear regression models 4 results the nilgiris mountains received the bulk of its rainfall between june and september fig 2 with an annual average of 2 150 mm over the three years a maximum of 2 740 mm during 2014 and a minimum of 1 380 mm during 2016 the median hourly rainfall was 0 5 mm h and the maximum was 40 5 mm h the median hourly discharge was 0 000028 mm s 1 and the maximum hourly discharge recorded was 0 0099 mm s 1 there were 39 523 events in the light rainfall category 2 194 events in the heavy rainfall category and 2 196 events in extreme rainfall categories box and whisker plots of hourly discharge responses plotted against canopy cover of catchments showed greater variability across catchment land cover and rainfall intensities fig 3 for light rainfall totals the median hourly discharge value from grassland 0 000084 mm s 1 was higher than the median hourly discharge observed in low density wattle catchments 0 000063 mm s 1 and high density wattle catchments 0 000060 mm s 1 fig 3a similarly for heavy rainfall grassland showed greater median discharge 0 00041 mm s 1 compared with wattle invaded catchments high density wattle 0 00027 mm s 1 low density wattle 0 00035 mm s 1 fig 3b however during extreme rainfall events all three land cover types showed similar median discharge values i e 0 00057 mm s 1 0 00054 mm s 1and 0 00056 mm s 1 in high density wattle catchments low density wattle catchments and grasslands respectively fig 3c this indicated a varying influence of wattle cover on runoff responses at different rainfall intensities gls linear regression models across the catchments with varying levels of wattle invasion low and high density wattle catchments and aicc based model selections suggested that the rainfall runoff relationships are largely influenced by three variables the catchment canopy cover drainage density and antecedent moisture conditions across rainfall intensities in the landscape table 2 as expected stream discharge increased with an increase in antecedent moisture conditions p 0 001 similarly discharge increased with an increase in drainage density within the catchment p 0 05 for light and extreme rainfall events table 2 canopy cover was an important factor as it appeared in all top regression models δaicc 2 across rainfall intensities canopy cover had positive slopes across all rainfall intensities suggesting an increase in hourly discharge rates with increasing canopy cover table 2 this suggests a likely increase in runoff with increase in wattle densities in the landscape and enhanced flood risk compared with native grasslands we recorded a total of 4 045 separate flood events hourly discharge 0 00047 mm s 1 across grassland and wattle catchments in the nilgiris landscape there were 562 events for the grassland catchment 187 events catchment year 1 411 events in low density wattle catchments 117 events catchment year and 2 072 flood events in high density wattle catchments 173 events catchment year the maximum hourly discharge observed in the grassland catchment 0 00098 mm s 1 was lower than the maximum discharges observed in low density 0 00529 mm s 1 and high density 0 00497 mm s 1 wattle catchments scatter plots suggested greater stream discharges during flood periods in catchments invaded by wattle compared with native grassland for a given rainfall event fig 4 a regression models across wattle invaded catchments revealed that canopy cover and drainage density were two important variables that influenced flood event magnitude along with ami and rainfall the directions of regression slopes were positive for canopy cover suggesting an increase in flood risk with an increase in wattle density in the catchment slope 0 00005 drainage density slope 0 1074 and hourly rainfall 0 00003 also had positive slopes while antecedent moisture conditions had a negative slope slope 0 0000006 table 3 the flood frequency curves prepared using daily peak discharge data suggest that at lower discharges the grassland catchment has a higher discharge magnitude compared to wattle catchments for a given flood frequency whereas at higher discharges the flood magnitude in wattle catchments is much greater than that in grassland catchment for a given flood frequency fig 4b indicating higher risk of severe flooding in wattle dominated catchments the lag time between rainfall and peak discharges varied with rainfall intensity and also with catchment vegetation cover the median lag time was 120 min in the grassland and high density wattle catchments while it was 60 min in low density wattle catchments fig 5 gls regression analysis suggested that canopy cover significantly influenced the lag time denser the canopy the longer was the lag time table 4 along with canopy cover drainage density also had a positive influence on lag time table 4 rainfall and ami had negative slopes suggesting more rapid runoff with increasing rainfall and antecedent moisture conditions in the catchment 5 discussion rainfall runoff responses were influenced by canopy cover the catchment drainage density and antecedent moisture conditions in the upper nilgiris region of south india these responses also varied with rainfall intensities canopy cover also influenced the peak flood discharges and lag time between rainfall and peak discharge responses canopy cover was part of the best regression models across all rainfall intensities the direction of regression slope was positive suggesting an increase in discharge with an increase in canopy cover a similar trend was observed with analysis of flood events hourly discharge 95th percentile regression models across wattle invaded catchments with flood event as response variable suggested an increase in rainfall runoff responses with an increase in canopy cover thus both results suggest that wattle invasion of native grasslands may result in increased stream discharge and severe floods in mountainous landscapes it is not easy to identify a single mechanism by which wattle cover could increase the flood risks in the mountainous landscapes prior studies in the region suggest that wattle plantations with their extended root systems are dominated by subsurface drainage networks krishnaswamy et al 2017 these sub surface drainage networks could help with effective transport of water to streams bypassing deep recharge to ground water recent work has also shown that watershed residence time in sub surface dominated catchments decreases the effects non linearly resulting from variations in average event rainfall intensity chappell et al 2017 the greater network of sub surface drainage networks that develop as wattle spreads across former grassland could be a reason for the observed increase in stream discharge with an increase in canopy cover at higher rainfall intensities wattle leaves are known to have high polyphenol content up to 20 of dry weight which reduces the rate of litter decomposition thus reducing organic carbon content de neergaard et al 2005 studies from south africa have found low soil organic carbon in wattle invaded areas compared with natural grasslands oelofse et al 2016 and this could decrease soil moisture holding capacity after wattle invasion further wattle exhibits more soil water repellency compared with natural grasslands scott 2000 soils under wattle plantations are also shown to have a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity than either natural grasslands or shola forests during an earlier study in these sites krishnaswamy et al 2017 also see appendix a thus a combination of factors such as lower soil organic carbon content lower saturated hydraulic conductivity high water repellency and enhancement of rapid subsurface flows by its root system networks could act together and increase the overland flow and near surface lateral flow in wattle dominant catchments during heavy to extreme rain events in the nilgiris a comparison of median discharge values during light rains suggest that grasslands show a greater magnitude of discharge compared with some of the wattle invaded catchments the flood curves also suggest that at lower discharges the grassland catchment has a higher discharge magnitude compared to wattle catchments for a given flood frequency such reductions in peak discharges in areas under dense canopy cover have been observed in other studies which has been attributed to larger soil moisture deficits created due to greater evapotranspiration losses by woody plants bathurst et al 2020 page et al 2020 furthermore the interception losses in dense canopies during light rains may result in reduced overland flows as observed in our study fahey and payne 2017 however during heavy and extreme rains peak discharges in wattle invaded catchments are greater in the nilgiris this suggest that in mountainous landscapes shallow subsurface flows and or overland flows are more important than evapotranspiration and canopy interception losses during high rainfall events the box and whisker plots show a greater variability in rainfall runoff responses across catchments this clearly suggests that along with canopy cover the other catchment characteristics and prevailing moisture conditions influence these relationships regression results suggest that antecedent moisture had a strong positive influence on peak discharge responses across different rainfall intensities however the analysis of flood events show a negative slope with ami regression analysis suggested an increase in the magnitude of storm event with an increase in drainage density across all rainfall intensities similar increases in storm event discharge in catchments with a high density of drainage network have been shown in earlier studies e g ogden et al 2011 thus the results indicate that the runoff responses are not only dependent on the infiltration excess process liu et al 2008 but are a result of complex relationships between catchment infiltration rate soil saturation water holding capacity and subsurface flows all of which are influenced by land cover the analysis of lag time between rainfall and peak discharges suggested an increase in lag time with an increase in canopy cover however when compared with the grassland catchment the median lag time in low density wattle catchments was less than the lag time observed in grasslands this further strengthens the argument that events with higher average rain intensities may trigger rapid shallow sub surface flows in wattle invaded catchments as previously suggested for hilly regions such as the nilgiris chappell et al 2017 median lag time in high density wattle catchments was greater than the lag time in low density wattle catchments this might indicate an influence of greater rainfall interception by dense canopy cover in high density wattle catchments compared with low density wattle catchments boyle et al 1989 cui et al 2012 dye et al 2001 koutnỳ et al 2014 levia et al 2011 livesley et al 2014 this effect is more pronounced during extreme rainfall events where the magnitude of the regression slopes during extreme rainfall is less than the slope values for heavy rainfall 6 conclusion we found canopy cover land cover to have a positive influence on rainfall runoff relationships during different rainfall intensities this is in contrast with other studies which found that during light to moderate rainfall land cover influenced peak stream flows while the role of land cover was minimal during extreme rains bathurst et al 2011 natural vegetation has been found to reduce flood risks in different parts of the world bathurst et al 2011 green and alila 2012 koutnỳ et al 2014 krishnaswamy et al 2012 our results suggest that extreme rainfall events such as those received in august 2019 that exceeded 50 mm h 1 are more likely to generate flooding from catchments that have been converted from natural vegetation to wattle plantations or those invaded by wattle therefore invasion of natural grasslands by wattle has serious ramifications for downstream flooding during the peak rainy season prioritisation of wattle invaded catchments for monitoring with high intensity rainfall discharge measurements could help the government and communities to be better prepared for floods in downstream areas the projected increase in frequency of intense storms due to climate change wehner et al 2021 strengthens the case for wattle control removal and site restoration to reduce impacts of floods in the nilgiris landscape furthermore several studies also suggest that wattle and other plantations contribute much more to annual evapotranspiration compared with native plants and significantly reduce stream discharge during the dry season chand et al 2009 duncan 2019 dye et al 2001 dye and jarmain 2004 sharma 1984 sikka et al 2003 an ongoing study in this landscape has also found a reduction in stream discharge in wattle dominant catchments during dry seasons which may be attributed to greater transpiration losses from wattle plantations e g bhalla et al 2015 this reduction in water availability during dry seasons also is a major concern associated with invasive exotic tree species future studies focusing on the comparative analysis of transpiration rates and water use by native and exotic plants could provide better understanding of water use in this landscape the regulation of wattle densities and restoration to semi natural grassland will thus simultaneously decrease flood risk under climate change as well as reduce transpiration demand in the dry season and increase stream discharge for ecosystem requirements and hydro power generation the government of tamil nadu is one of the first states in india to have a policy and management plan for invasive species and their regulation wattle has been identified as one of the species of concern our results provide further inputs to their wattle management policy grasslands continue to be seen as degraded areas and have been targeted for afforestation historically often with non native plantation crops arasumani et al 2018 chandran 1997 jha et al 2000 joshi et al 2018 this perception of grasslands being degraded and their conversion to plantations persists globally veldman et al 2015 and in some current policies in india moefcc 2010 which seek to combat climate change through large scale afforestation disregarding the potential impact on water resources jackson et al 2005 another example of this is the atlas of forest landscape restoration opportunities atlas of forest and landscape restoration opportunities 2014 which identifies several of the natural montane grasslands in the western ghats as priority areas for wide scale restoration our results suggest that planted and invasive wattle stands have a significant hydrologic footprint and might be detrimental to the hydrologic services of catchments in the nilgiris in both the dry and wet seasons in the nilgiris removal of wattle and restoration of the montane grasslands has been mandated by the government following a public interest litigation filed in 2014 vinod kumar 2014 such removal activities have mainly targeted clear felling of large matured stands of wattle plantations we caution against such removals of large stands as our results reveal that high density wattle catchments have a longer lag time and could help in retaining water for a longer duration of time in extreme rainfall events compared with catchments that have lower and intermediate densities of wattle further once established wattle builds substantial seed banks and rapidly regenerates after removal this would amplify the hydrologic impact of wattle stands which unlike the mature wattle stands are likely to have far higher evapotranspiration rates cui et al 2012 and overland flow we found that wattle plants which have invaded several of the montane grassland systems in the nilgiris joshi et al 2018 increase flood risks during heavy and extreme rainfall events our study finds that extreme rainfall events 7 45 mm h 1 behave differently when they are received by a wattle plantation compared with native grasslands an extreme rainfall event is more likely to generate a flood in a wattle dominant catchment than one dominated by a native grassland shola forest mosaic we found that along with land cover catchment drainage density also influences the rainfall runoff relationship therefore future flood early warning systems and risk management strategies should consider the differential effects of land cover including different densities of woody vegetation and catchment morphometric properties along with antecedent moisture conditions to improved flood forecasting at different rainfall intensities credit authorship contribution statement rajat ramakant nayak data curation formal

2514,invasive trees in catchments around the world are a source of concern due to their hydrological and ecological impacts a large number of studies have focused on their impact on dry season stream discharge due to enhanced transpiration the impact of invasive trees on stream discharge and flood risk during extreme rain events which are becoming more frequent due to climate change has not been addressed adequately we examined the influence of land cover canopy cover and other catchment morphological characteristics on stream discharges in hilly catchments during light heavy and extreme rain events three years of rainfall runoff observations between january 2014 and december 2016 were collected in eleven neighbouring mountainous catchments in nilgiris south india each catchment had a distinct land cover namely shola forests montane grasslands and catchments invaded by wattle acacia mearnsii hourly rain intensities between the percentiles 25 90 90 95 and over 95 were categorised as light heavy and extreme respectively and were used to study hourly peak stream discharge responses we compared discharge between native grassland catchments and grassland catchments invaded by wattle discharge rates were corrected for the catchment area we found that land cover and canopy cover influenced the hydrologic response to extreme rain events regression models with flood event as the response variable suggested an increase in rainfall runoff response with an increase in canopy cover the maximum hourly discharge observed in the reference grassland catchment 0 00098 mm s 1 was lower than the maximum discharge observed in low density 0 00529 mm s 1 and high density 0 00497 mm s 1 wattle catchments at higher discharges the flood magnitude in wattle invaded catchments was much greater than that in the grassland catchment for a given flood frequency indicating a higher risk of severe flooding in wattle dominated catchments we attribute the enhanced flood discharges to the effects of spreading wattle roots on the enhancement of rapid shallow sub surface flows in invaded catchments catchments dominated by shallow sub surface flows are known to have reduced water retention times in response to high rain intensities antecedent moisture conditions and drainage density were other factors that influenced the local rainfall runoff relationships in the western ghats and other parts of india grasslands have been planted with exotic woody trees and some have become invasive our study indicates that replacing grasslands with woody plants at landscape scales could affect hydrological processes and could increase flood risks during the monsoon especially in mountainous regions management of invaded catchments by regulation of wattle and restoration of semi natural grassland combined with the installation of early warning systems in these impacted areas will help reduce flood risk during extreme rain under climate change keywords wattle western ghats

nerc s environmental information data centre bhalla et al 2020 1 introduction global climate change scenarios often show an increased frequency of extreme events particularly rainfall which is a major concern worldwide goswami et al 2006 guhathakurta et al 2011 mason et al 1999 osborn et al 2000 wehner et al 2021 zhou et al 2013 such extreme rain events ere often lead to destructive floods causing extensive loss of lives and property fowler and kilsby 2003 guhathakurta et al 2011 mishra and shah 2018 ranger et al 2011 during heavy rains the saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils may be exceeded koutnỳ et al 2014 and apart from infiltration excess overland flow rapid sub surface pathways are activated bonell et al 2010 chappell et al 2017 resulting in higher and quicker discharge from the basin the problem is more serious in mountainous terrain where steep slopes accelerate the delivery of water to streams leading to a rapid discharge of water and sediments downstream serrano muela et al 2013 understanding the relationship between rainfall and discharge response of basins can help design mitigation strategies for destructive floods such relationships need to be studied at local scales as most water flow enters rivers via low order channels and is governed by catchment characteristics and micro climate borga et al 2014 a large number of local topographic and hydrologic factors such as steepness of slopes catchment shape and size brown et al 1999 dunne 1978 kirkby et al 2005 mcglynn et al 2004 pearce 1990 drainage density d odorico and rigon 2003 rinaldo et al 1991 and antecedent moisture chappell et al 2017 haga et al 2005 kim et al 2019 ogden et al 2011 song and wang 2019 influence the rainfall runoff relationships vegetative cover often a human managed characteristic of the catchment also may play a significant role in mediating the rainfall runoff response vegetation can alter infiltration of precipitation into headwater soils koutnỳ et al 2014 certain types of vegetation add organic matter to the soil and thus enhance infiltration thereby decreasing the amount and velocity of overland flow and erosive forces bathurst et al 2011 koutnỳ et al 2014 krishnaswamy et al 2012 replacing native vegetation within grasslands with fast growing species such as eucalyptus and wattle may greatly increase both interception loss and transpiration and can reduce streamflows particularly during the dry season basappa et al 2014 calder and dye 2001 chand et al 2009 clulow et al 2011 dye and jarmain 2004 jackson et al 2005 prinsloo and scott 1999 samraj et al 1988 sharda et al 1988 sikka et al 2003 however the role of invasive alien trees on runoff responses to extreme rainfall events in the wet season is not adequately known relative to other functions and services that have been studied e g pejchar and mooney 2009 the nilgiris is part of the western ghats biodiversity hotspot and is known for its mosaic of high altitude montane rain forests sholas and grasslands a large number of exotic plants were introduced in these natural grasslands and sholas and some of these exotics particularly wattles acacia mearnsii and acacia dealbata have invaded natural grasslands joshi et al 2018 wattles are fast growing erect evergreen trees growing up to 10 m tall native to southeastern australia in native habitat where bushfires are common the wattle helps to bind together erosion prone soils quickly due to rapid growth rates nitrogen fixing abilities and development of large crowns wattles have managed to outcompete native vegetation and have invaded natural grasslands and shrublands in many parts of the world acacia mearnsii also known as black wattle is listed as one of the world s 100 most invasive alien plant species lowe et al 2000 van der weijden et al 2007 in south africa wattles have altered fire regime increased erosion reduced biodiversity and destabilised river banks adair 2002 de wit et al 2001 le maitre et al 1999 samways et al 1996 studies also suggest that compared to native vegetation wattles exhibit high evapotranspiration rates and high use of soil moisture throughout the year resulting in reduced streamflow dye et al 2001 dye and jarmain 2004 our preliminary study in this landscape also found a reduction in streamflow in wattle dominated catchments during the dry season bhalla et al 2015 however the role of wattle in influencing rainfall runoff relationships particularly during extreme rainfall events has not been established empirically in the nilgiris region rangan et al 2010 and this study tries to address this evidence gap the majority of studies on the hydrological impacts of wattle have focused on the interception loss and water consumption by wattle and conclude that wattle reduces streamflow however there are certain traits associated with wattle that could result in decreased or increased flood risks in wattle dominated landscapes wattles have a denser canopy cover compared with the native grasslands which could enhance interception loss and transpiration and thus reduce antecedent moisture at the start of flood events thereby resulting in reduced flood risks bathurst et al 2020 at the same time their litter may not integrate as well into the soil compared with native vegetation and thereby not aid infiltration resulting in increased overland flow over the mineral soil bonell et al 2010 a greater soil repellency is observed in areas under wattle cover compared with areas under native grassland and shrubs which is associated with a greater risk of overland flow on mountain slopes scott 2000 prior studies in the nilgiris suggest subsurface drainage networks dominate under wattle plantations chappell et al 2017 krishnaswamy et al 2017 consequently if wattle root systems increase lateral soil permeability this could in principle speed water to streams in extreme events in this study we compare the hydrologic response of natural grasslands and the introduced invasive wattle at different rainfall intensities we examine the relationship between hourly rainfall and the magnitude of peak discharge for the distribution of different rainfall events this analysis could help the government and communities to be alert to differences in behaviour of wattle and grassland catchments during extreme rainfall events 2 study area this study was conducted in the nilgiris reserve forest in the western ghats biodiversity hot spot myers et al 2000 in south india fig 1 the nilgiris or the blue mountains 76 77 15 e 11 15 12 15 n are part of the nilgiri biosphere reserve established in 1986 the first biosphere reserve in india daniels 1996 the nilgiris are home to 15 different indigenous tribes and harbour a large number of threatened and endemic species of flora and fauna daniels 1996 elevation in the nilgiris ranges from 1000 m to 2600 m asl which has given rise to diverse vegetation types such as montane rain forests in the valleys locally known as sholas interspersed by high altitude grasslands nilgiris forms an important catchment area for several perennial tributaries of the cauvery india wris 2020 including bhavani on which large human populations are dependent downstream these streams and rivers are managed extensively for power generation irrigation and drinking water through a chain of dams and reservoirs india reservoirs india wris 2020 in 2018 and 2019 several parts of the western ghats repeatedly experienced heavy rains and subsequent floods destroyed several villages and triggered a large number of landslides leading to the loss of many human lives and livelihoods menon 2019 mishra et al 2018 mishra and shah 2018 safi 2018 this study was located at avalanche in the nilgiris which was the epicentre of ere during august 2019 premkumar 2019 twc 2019 which washed away all the water level recorders used in this study floods and landslides in the western ghats have often been attributed to changes in land cover and land use over the last century vasantha kumar and bhagavanulu 2008 a large number of exotic plants were introduced in the natural grasslands and sholas and some of these exotics particularly wattles acacia mearnsii and acacia dealbata have invaded natural grasslands joshi et al 2018 rainfall and stream flows have been monitored at the study site since 2012 and it is one of the field research sites under the critical zone exploration network https www czen org content western ghats 3 methods 3 1 data collection we conducted our study in the 1000 km2 area of the nilgiris forest division which included 11 monitored catchments we collected and analysed three years of rainfall runoff data from january 2014 to december 2016 data from 2017 onwards was not used because a forest fire in the last two weeks of february 2017 had significantly altered the land cover of the region sriramamurthy et al 2020 we used tipping bucket rain gauges rainwise 2012 to measure rainfall we had 26 rain gauges placed in an approximate grid of one kilometre that recorded rainfall at one minute intervals ten of these were located within the study catchments we used the mean rainfall readings when two or more rain gauges were present in the same catchment water levels were measured at five minute intervals in eleven streams instrumented with stilling wells and capacitance water level recorders wlrs dataflow systems limited 2017 we converted stage values to discharge using rating curves developed through a combination of spot current meter gauging and slug injection salt dilution methods shaw et al 2010 spot current meters were used to measure stream velocity during low flows while salt dilution methods were employed to measure velocities at both low and high flows we used nearly 55 70 velocity readings obtained across three years to develop rating curves for each catchment the streams were low order 1 3 and the total catchment area covered was 1 200 ha digital elevation models obtained from srtm nasa jpl 2013 combined with high resolution imagery from google earth google earth 2019 earth google com web and field verification using gps units garmin etrex 10 were used to delineate the catchments we had a total of 11 monitored headwater catchments in the study area canopy cover is known to influence the runoff responses by intercepting and immediately evaporating a proportion of the rainfall as wet canopy evaporation or interception loss cui et al 2012 dye et al 2001 levia et al 2011 livesley et al 2014 hence we calculated median enhanced vegetation index evi which was used as a proxy for canopy cover henceforth referred to as canopy cover for each of the catchments evi was developed by using sentinel 2 images from the dry season of april 2016 esa 2016 based on field survey and evi we classified each of these catchments into three broad classes grasslands sholas and wattle dominated catchments however many of the grasslands had a varying level of invasion by wattle hence we further classified the catchments in to four categories based on land cover and wattle cover densities henceforth referred as land cover natural grasslands 90 grassland cover n 1 low density wattle grasslands with wattle cover ranging from 17 to 40 n 4 high density wattle 55 wattle cover n 4 and shola 80 montane forests n 2 table 1 we found a strong correlation r 0 96 between canopy cover and the land cover categories of the catchments four different morphological characteristics basin shape area steepness of the slopes and drainage density were derived for each of the catchments catchment shape was measured using the circularity index ci or ratio which could help forecasting the flood potential of a basin the ci is expressed as ci ab ac where ab is the area of the basin and ac is the area of a circle with the same length of perimeter as the basin allaby 2013 a layer of drainage networks was developed using the r watershed module in grass 7 grass development team 2018 drainage density was expressed as m m 2 for each catchment steepness of the catchment slope was also obtained using the r watershed module which generates a slope steepness factor as defined for the universal soil loss equation mccool et al 1987 the soil type was similar across all the catchments as per the national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss lup sehgal et al 1987 and is described as clayey skeletal mixed typic haplustalfs and typic ustropepts table 1 antecedent moisture conditions are known to influence rainfall runoff relationships chappell et al 2017 haga et al 2005 kim et al 2019 song and wang 2019 we therefore derived an antecedent moisture index ami which is an approximation of the moisture stored within a catchment before a particular rainfall event ami was developed by deducting total discharge from the cumulative rainfall over the 14 antecedent days or 14 24 h we found a strong correlation r 0 96 between this index and the widely used antecedent precipitation index api kohler and linsley 1951 developed using a decay constant k value of 0 9 and considering 14 antecedent days 3 2 analysis box and whisker plots and regression models were used to analyse discharge responses of different catchments at different hourly rainfall intensities and the influence of canopy cover dominant land cover type and other catchment morphological characteristics potentially pertinent to rainfall runoff response data processing and analysis was carried out using the r statistical software r core team 2019 all rainfall and discharge data were aggregated in to hourly datasets for each catchment discharge m3 s 1 was measured for each stream on a 5 minute interval and aggregated to give a time series of peak hourly discharge discharge was then divided by the area of the corresponding catchment to obtain hourly discharge per unit area and expressed as millimetres per second mm s 1 henceforth referred to as hourly discharges data from the dry season january to april was excluded from the analysis we collected a total of 257 776 h of data across 11 catchments the lag time between hourly rainfall and hourly peak discharge values was investigated using cross correlation function ccf available in r ccf helps in computing the correlation between hourly rainfall and discharge up to a defined lag to estimate the lag time we constructed an hourly dataset including only data where rain was observed on two or more consecutive days data from the first 24 h of such continuous rain time series were removed to reduce the influence of antecedent conditions on the lag time estimates discharge data representing up to 7 days of lag 7 24 h were constructed the lag time representing maximum correlation between hourly rainfall and hourly discharge was identified for each catchment using the maximum ccf value the discharge values corresponding to these lag times were used in all rainfall runoff analyses our final dataset comprised a total of 126 473 h of rainfall discharge data hourly rainfall across all the catchments was grouped into three rainfall intensities i low intensity rainfall light rain rainfall values below 90th percentile 4 75 mm h 1 ii heavy rain between 90th percentile and 95th percentile 4 75 mm h 1 and 7 45 mm h 1 and iii extreme rainfall 95th percentile and above 7 45 mm h 1 we calculated percentiles of all non zero hourly rainfall values between 1st may and 31st december from 2014 to 2016 box and whisker plots were used to examine the variability in discharge responses across different catchments and rainfall intensities for this we used canopy cover median evi in each catchment as an independent variable and lagged hourly discharge as the response variable we compared median lagged hourly discharge values of wattle invaded catchments with natural grassland at different rainfall totals using these plots we further analysed rainfall runoff relationships across catchments by fitting linear additive models using generalised least squares gls at different rainfall intensities the response variable was lagged hourly discharge data the predictor variables in the models included hourly rainfall ami pertaining up to that hour catchment canopy cover median evi and other morphometric characteristics catchment area shape steepness of the slopes and drainage density catchments dominated by shola land cover were excluded from the analysis as we were interested in understanding the changes caused by wattle invasion into the grasslands further as the grassland category had only one catchment we included only catchments that had varying levels of wattle cover low and high density wattle categories in the gls linear regression models variables introducing collinearity in the model were identified using the cross correlation table obtained while running gls regression analysis the gls model outputs suggested that the covariates catchment area shape and steepness of the slopes were highly correlated correlation 0 5 and hence were removed from the models the most plausible explanatory variables and the best model for describing variations in hourly discharges between catchments at different rainfall intensities were selected using akaike information criteria with bias adjustment aicc burnham and anderson 2002 the rainfall only model was used as a null model to compare the results model averaged coefficients full average were used whenever δaicc values of less than two were obtained to select the most plausible explanatory variables in addition to rainfall discharge analysis at different rainfall intensities we analysed the influence of various factors on flood events we defined flood events as hourly discharges that were greater than or equal to 95th percentile 0 00047 mm s 1 we used scatter plots and gls linear regression models on this data subset to explore the influence of land cover and other catchment morphological characteristics on rainfall flood events in addition to chronological pairing of rainfall discharge data we also used flood frequency paired plots to examine the impact of wattle cover on peak discharges ideally annual peak discharges are used to prepare flood frequency plots as we had only three years of data we constructed a flood frequency plot by using a time series of daily peak discharges the recurrence time days for different size of floods were derived by calculating exceedance probabilities gringorten 1963 the distribution of flood frequency curves across different catchments was compared to understand the influence of vegetation cover on peak discharges we also analysed the relationship between time lag between rainfall and peak discharge and other predictor variables using box and whisker plots and linear regression models 4 results the nilgiris mountains received the bulk of its rainfall between june and september fig 2 with an annual average of 2 150 mm over the three years a maximum of 2 740 mm during 2014 and a minimum of 1 380 mm during 2016 the median hourly rainfall was 0 5 mm h and the maximum was 40 5 mm h the median hourly discharge was 0 000028 mm s 1 and the maximum hourly discharge recorded was 0 0099 mm s 1 there were 39 523 events in the light rainfall category 2 194 events in the heavy rainfall category and 2 196 events in extreme rainfall categories box and whisker plots of hourly discharge responses plotted against canopy cover of catchments showed greater variability across catchment land cover and rainfall intensities fig 3 for light rainfall totals the median hourly discharge value from grassland 0 000084 mm s 1 was higher than the median hourly discharge observed in low density wattle catchments 0 000063 mm s 1 and high density wattle catchments 0 000060 mm s 1 fig 3a similarly for heavy rainfall grassland showed greater median discharge 0 00041 mm s 1 compared with wattle invaded catchments high density wattle 0 00027 mm s 1 low density wattle 0 00035 mm s 1 fig 3b however during extreme rainfall events all three land cover types showed similar median discharge values i e 0 00057 mm s 1 0 00054 mm s 1and 0 00056 mm s 1 in high density wattle catchments low density wattle catchments and grasslands respectively fig 3c this indicated a varying influence of wattle cover on runoff responses at different rainfall intensities gls linear regression models across the catchments with varying levels of wattle invasion low and high density wattle catchments and aicc based model selections suggested that the rainfall runoff relationships are largely influenced by three variables the catchment canopy cover drainage density and antecedent moisture conditions across rainfall intensities in the landscape table 2 as expected stream discharge increased with an increase in antecedent moisture conditions p 0 001 similarly discharge increased with an increase in drainage density within the catchment p 0 05 for light and extreme rainfall events table 2 canopy cover was an important factor as it appeared in all top regression models δaicc 2 across rainfall intensities canopy cover had positive slopes across all rainfall intensities suggesting an increase in hourly discharge rates with increasing canopy cover table 2 this suggests a likely increase in runoff with increase in wattle densities in the landscape and enhanced flood risk compared with native grasslands we recorded a total of 4 045 separate flood events hourly discharge 0 00047 mm s 1 across grassland and wattle catchments in the nilgiris landscape there were 562 events for the grassland catchment 187 events catchment year 1 411 events in low density wattle catchments 117 events catchment year and 2 072 flood events in high density wattle catchments 173 events catchment year the maximum hourly discharge observed in the grassland catchment 0 00098 mm s 1 was lower than the maximum discharges observed in low density 0 00529 mm s 1 and high density 0 00497 mm s 1 wattle catchments scatter plots suggested greater stream discharges during flood periods in catchments invaded by wattle compared with native grassland for a given rainfall event fig 4 a regression models across wattle invaded catchments revealed that canopy cover and drainage density were two important variables that influenced flood event magnitude along with ami and rainfall the directions of regression slopes were positive for canopy cover suggesting an increase in flood risk with an increase in wattle density in the catchment slope 0 00005 drainage density slope 0 1074 and hourly rainfall 0 00003 also had positive slopes while antecedent moisture conditions had a negative slope slope 0 0000006 table 3 the flood frequency curves prepared using daily peak discharge data suggest that at lower discharges the grassland catchment has a higher discharge magnitude compared to wattle catchments for a given flood frequency whereas at higher discharges the flood magnitude in wattle catchments is much greater than that in grassland catchment for a given flood frequency fig 4b indicating higher risk of severe flooding in wattle dominated catchments the lag time between rainfall and peak discharges varied with rainfall intensity and also with catchment vegetation cover the median lag time was 120 min in the grassland and high density wattle catchments while it was 60 min in low density wattle catchments fig 5 gls regression analysis suggested that canopy cover significantly influenced the lag time denser the canopy the longer was the lag time table 4 along with canopy cover drainage density also had a positive influence on lag time table 4 rainfall and ami had negative slopes suggesting more rapid runoff with increasing rainfall and antecedent moisture conditions in the catchment 5 discussion rainfall runoff responses were influenced by canopy cover the catchment drainage density and antecedent moisture conditions in the upper nilgiris region of south india these responses also varied with rainfall intensities canopy cover also influenced the peak flood discharges and lag time between rainfall and peak discharge responses canopy cover was part of the best regression models across all rainfall intensities the direction of regression slope was positive suggesting an increase in discharge with an increase in canopy cover a similar trend was observed with analysis of flood events hourly discharge 95th percentile regression models across wattle invaded catchments with flood event as response variable suggested an increase in rainfall runoff responses with an increase in canopy cover thus both results suggest that wattle invasion of native grasslands may result in increased stream discharge and severe floods in mountainous landscapes it is not easy to identify a single mechanism by which wattle cover could increase the flood risks in the mountainous landscapes prior studies in the region suggest that wattle plantations with their extended root systems are dominated by subsurface drainage networks krishnaswamy et al 2017 these sub surface drainage networks could help with effective transport of water to streams bypassing deep recharge to ground water recent work has also shown that watershed residence time in sub surface dominated catchments decreases the effects non linearly resulting from variations in average event rainfall intensity chappell et al 2017 the greater network of sub surface drainage networks that develop as wattle spreads across former grassland could be a reason for the observed increase in stream discharge with an increase in canopy cover at higher rainfall intensities wattle leaves are known to have high polyphenol content up to 20 of dry weight which reduces the rate of litter decomposition thus reducing organic carbon content de neergaard et al 2005 studies from south africa have found low soil organic carbon in wattle invaded areas compared with natural grasslands oelofse et al 2016 and this could decrease soil moisture holding capacity after wattle invasion further wattle exhibits more soil water repellency compared with natural grasslands scott 2000 soils under wattle plantations are also shown to have a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity than either natural grasslands or shola forests during an earlier study in these sites krishnaswamy et al 2017 also see appendix a thus a combination of factors such as lower soil organic carbon content lower saturated hydraulic conductivity high water repellency and enhancement of rapid subsurface flows by its root system networks could act together and increase the overland flow and near surface lateral flow in wattle dominant catchments during heavy to extreme rain events in the nilgiris a comparison of median discharge values during light rains suggest that grasslands show a greater magnitude of discharge compared with some of the wattle invaded catchments the flood curves also suggest that at lower discharges the grassland catchment has a higher discharge magnitude compared to wattle catchments for a given flood frequency such reductions in peak discharges in areas under dense canopy cover have been observed in other studies which has been attributed to larger soil moisture deficits created due to greater evapotranspiration losses by woody plants bathurst et al 2020 page et al 2020 furthermore the interception losses in dense canopies during light rains may result in reduced overland flows as observed in our study fahey and payne 2017 however during heavy and extreme rains peak discharges in wattle invaded catchments are greater in the nilgiris this suggest that in mountainous landscapes shallow subsurface flows and or overland flows are more important than evapotranspiration and canopy interception losses during high rainfall events the box and whisker plots show a greater variability in rainfall runoff responses across catchments this clearly suggests that along with canopy cover the other catchment characteristics and prevailing moisture conditions influence these relationships regression results suggest that antecedent moisture had a strong positive influence on peak discharge responses across different rainfall intensities however the analysis of flood events show a negative slope with ami regression analysis suggested an increase in the magnitude of storm event with an increase in drainage density across all rainfall intensities similar increases in storm event discharge in catchments with a high density of drainage network have been shown in earlier studies e g ogden et al 2011 thus the results indicate that the runoff responses are not only dependent on the infiltration excess process liu et al 2008 but are a result of complex relationships between catchment infiltration rate soil saturation water holding capacity and subsurface flows all of which are influenced by land cover the analysis of lag time between rainfall and peak discharges suggested an increase in lag time with an increase in canopy cover however when compared with the grassland catchment the median lag time in low density wattle catchments was less than the lag time observed in grasslands this further strengthens the argument that events with higher average rain intensities may trigger rapid shallow sub surface flows in wattle invaded catchments as previously suggested for hilly regions such as the nilgiris chappell et al 2017 median lag time in high density wattle catchments was greater than the lag time in low density wattle catchments this might indicate an influence of greater rainfall interception by dense canopy cover in high density wattle catchments compared with low density wattle catchments boyle et al 1989 cui et al 2012 dye et al 2001 koutnỳ et al 2014 levia et al 2011 livesley et al 2014 this effect is more pronounced during extreme rainfall events where the magnitude of the regression slopes during extreme rainfall is less than the slope values for heavy rainfall 6 conclusion we found canopy cover land cover to have a positive influence on rainfall runoff relationships during different rainfall intensities this is in contrast with other studies which found that during light to moderate rainfall land cover influenced peak stream flows while the role of land cover was minimal during extreme rains bathurst et al 2011 natural vegetation has been found to reduce flood risks in different parts of the world bathurst et al 2011 green and alila 2012 koutnỳ et al 2014 krishnaswamy et al 2012 our results suggest that extreme rainfall events such as those received in august 2019 that exceeded 50 mm h 1 are more likely to generate flooding from catchments that have been converted from natural vegetation to wattle plantations or those invaded by wattle therefore invasion of natural grasslands by wattle has serious ramifications for downstream flooding during the peak rainy season prioritisation of wattle invaded catchments for monitoring with high intensity rainfall discharge measurements could help the government and communities to be better prepared for floods in downstream areas the projected increase in frequency of intense storms due to climate change wehner et al 2021 strengthens the case for wattle control removal and site restoration to reduce impacts of floods in the nilgiris landscape furthermore several studies also suggest that wattle and other plantations contribute much more to annual evapotranspiration compared with native plants and significantly reduce stream discharge during the dry season chand et al 2009 duncan 2019 dye et al 2001 dye and jarmain 2004 sharma 1984 sikka et al 2003 an ongoing study in this landscape has also found a reduction in stream discharge in wattle dominant catchments during dry seasons which may be attributed to greater transpiration losses from wattle plantations e g bhalla et al 2015 this reduction in water availability during dry seasons also is a major concern associated with invasive exotic tree species future studies focusing on the comparative analysis of transpiration rates and water use by native and exotic plants could provide better understanding of water use in this landscape the regulation of wattle densities and restoration to semi natural grassland will thus simultaneously decrease flood risk under climate change as well as reduce transpiration demand in the dry season and increase stream discharge for ecosystem requirements and hydro power generation the government of tamil nadu is one of the first states in india to have a policy and management plan for invasive species and their regulation wattle has been identified as one of the species of concern our results provide further inputs to their wattle management policy grasslands continue to be seen as degraded areas and have been targeted for afforestation historically often with non native plantation crops arasumani et al 2018 chandran 1997 jha et al 2000 joshi et al 2018 this perception of grasslands being degraded and their conversion to plantations persists globally veldman et al 2015 and in some current policies in india moefcc 2010 which seek to combat climate change through large scale afforestation disregarding the potential impact on water resources jackson et al 2005 another example of this is the atlas of forest landscape restoration opportunities atlas of forest and landscape restoration opportunities 2014 which identifies several of the natural montane grasslands in the western ghats as priority areas for wide scale restoration our results suggest that planted and invasive wattle stands have a significant hydrologic footprint and might be detrimental to the hydrologic services of catchments in the nilgiris in both the dry and wet seasons in the nilgiris removal of wattle and restoration of the montane grasslands has been mandated by the government following a public interest litigation filed in 2014 vinod kumar 2014 such removal activities have mainly targeted clear felling of large matured stands of wattle plantations we caution against such removals of large stands as our results reveal that high density wattle catchments have a longer lag time and could help in retaining water for a longer duration of time in extreme rainfall events compared with catchments that have lower and intermediate densities of wattle further once established wattle builds substantial seed banks and rapidly regenerates after removal this would amplify the hydrologic impact of wattle stands which unlike the mature wattle stands are likely to have far higher evapotranspiration rates cui et al 2012 and overland flow we found that wattle plants which have invaded several of the montane grassland systems in the nilgiris joshi et al 2018 increase flood risks during heavy and extreme rainfall events our study finds that extreme rainfall events 7 45 mm h 1 behave differently when they are received by a wattle plantation compared with native grasslands an extreme rainfall event is more likely to generate a flood in a wattle dominant catchment than one dominated by a native grassland shola forest mosaic we found that along with land cover catchment drainage density also influences the rainfall runoff relationship therefore future flood early warning systems and risk management strategies should consider the differential effects of land cover including different densities of woody vegetation and catchment morphometric properties along with antecedent moisture conditions to improved flood forecasting at different rainfall intensities credit authorship contribution statement rajat ramakant nayak data curation formal
