13235,as 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid pbsa represents most extensively used uv absorber release of pbsa into the aquatic environment has posed huge risks to the ecology because pbsa is an endocrine disruptor and highly soluble in water for developing effective approaches to eliminate pbsa from water this study develops cobalt sulfide for the first time as a heterogeneous catalyst to activate monopersulfate mp for producing sulfate radical so4 to degrade pbsa in particular a cubic bundle of cobalt sulfide nanoplates cosnp is created from a convenient sulfurization of cobaltic metal organic framework comof to convert this comof to cosnp this resultant cosnp can show much higher catalytic activities than the pristine comof and the reference catalyst co3o4 nanoparticle for activating mp to degrade pbsa with very low dosages of cosnp 25 mg l and mp 100 mg l 5 mg l of pbsa can be completely removed in 45 min proving that cosnp is a promising catalyst for activating mp to pbsa the activation mechanism and degradation pathway of pbsa degradation by cosnp mp is investigated here by electron paramagnetic resonance and mass spectrometry to offer useful insights into degradation behaviors for developing sulfate radical based processes of pbsa degradation using cobalt sulfide catalysts graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sunscreen agent prussian blue analogue aops sulfate radical uv irradiation 1 introduction sunscreens have become one of the most common personal care products for protecting skin through adsorption of uv irradiation by uv absorbers among various types of uv absorbers 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid pbsa represents a widely used water soluble uv absorber because pbsa can effectively absorb irradiation of uv b region 1 2 nevertheless pbsa has been confirmed to exhibit endocrine disrupting effects 3 4 and release of highly soluble pbsa into aquatic environments would then pose risks to ecology therefore it is necessary to develop useful treatments to eliminate pbsa from water to avoid its adverse effects recently sulfate radical so4 based chemical oxidation techniques sr cot have received growing interests for treating endocrine disruptors and emerging contaminants 5 9 because so4 has a stronger oxidation power 2 5 3 1 v than hydroxyl radicals oh i e 1 9 2 7 v thus a few sr cot based on catalytic activation of monopersulfate mp have been proposed to degrade pbsa recently because mp represents an environmentally benign and inexpensive source of so4 and mp can be catalyzed for rapid generation of so4 for instance zhang et al proposed a composite of n s doped carbon nanotubes and cufe2o4 as a heterogeneous catalyst to activate mp to degrade pbsa 4 whereas al anazi et al proposed various cobalt ferrites for activating mp to degrade pbsa 3 even though these metal oxides seem feasible to activate mp to degrade pb recently metal sulfides especially cobalt sulfides have also attracted increasing attention as heterogeneous catalysts because cobalt is the most effective metal for activating mp and cobalt sulfides can exhibit more active redox characteristics 10 enabling cobalt sulfides promising heterogeneous catalysts for activation mp 11 nevertheless almost no studies of using cobalt sulfides has been conducted to investigate its catalytic capacities towards mp activation to degrade pbsa therefore the goal of this study is to develop and evaluate cobalt sulfides for mp activation to degrade pbsa in particular a unique approach is employed here by using a cubic cobaltic metal organic framework comof in the form of co3 co cn 6 2 as an initial template which can be convenient sulfurized becoming cobalt sulfides owing to special cubic configuration of comof the as sulfurized cobalt sulfide can exhibit the cubic structure decorated with nanoplates this cubic bundle of cobalt sulfide nanoplate cosnp shall be an intriguing and useful heterogeneous catalyst for activating mp to degrade pbsa as no such catalyst has ever been even reported for activating mp results of this study would also offer valuable information about design characterization and application of cosnp for degradation of emerging contaminants by sr cot as sunscreen agents are increasingly detected in swimming pool the proposed process can be applied for treating swimming pool wastewater in order to reuse the swimming pool water several studies have also indicated that advanced oxidation processes aops would be promising techniques for treating these sunscreen agents in swimming pool water 12 we believe that our findings obtained here would be valuable for providing insights into the treatment of swimming pool wastewater 2 experimental for preparing cubic bundle of cosnp a synthesis scheme can be displayed in fig 1 firstly a cobaltic mof in the form of co3 co cn 6 2 was synthesized and employed as a precursor through a conventional precipitation approach 13 for converting comof cubes into cubic bundle of cos nanoplate cosnp a straightforward technique was employed here through sulfurization of comof by mixing comof with na2s for evaluating pbsa degradation efficiency using mp activated by cosnp was investigated by batch type experiments detailed preparation procedures and experimental steps of pbsa degradation can be found in the supporting information details of analysis of pbsa fig s1 and other analytic methods can be also found in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of cosnp for preparing the cubic bundle of cosnp the cubic comof was particularly adopted here thus it would be necessary to confirm whether the shape of the comof was cubic as shown in fig 2 a b the as prepared comof in the form of co3 co cn 6 2 certainly exhibited a cubic morphology with well defined edges besides its surfaces were also highly smooth without noticeable deformation and wrinkles nevertheless once this cubic comof was sulfurized the cubic shape of the original comof was still observed but its surfaces became fluffy wrinkled and decorated with many curved nanoscale plates the corresponding tem image fig 2 d also validated that these nanoplates were very thin and assembled irregularly on the surfaces forming a cubic bundle of nanoplates to further probe into the composition of this cubic bundle of nanoplates fig 2 e shows the corresponding eds spectrum and a significant signal of sulfur s was detected in addition to cobalt co as the original comof did not contain any sulfur this eds analysis indicated that comof had been successfully modified with s in addition the xrd pattern of the original comof fig s2 which can be well indexed to the typical pattern of co3 co cn 6 2 14 15 had been also completely changed validating the crystalline structure of comof had been varied instead the resultant sulfurized derivative of comof exhibited two significant peaks at 34 4 and 59 5 which corresponded to cobalt sulfide species in the form of cos jdpcs 65 0407 and co4s3 jdpcs 30 0458 these characterizations revealed that the cubic comof had been transferred into cubic bundle of cobalt sulfide nanoplates cosnp through the straightforward sulfurization treatment by na2s moreover the elemental mapping analyses fig 3 a c also demonstrated that elements of co and s could be evenly distributed over the surfaces of such a cubic assemble of cosnp suggesting that the original comof was thoroughly and homogeneously sulfurized to further characterize its surface chemistry xps analyses were adopted and the full survey xps spectrum of cosnp was displayed in fig 3 d in which significant signals of co and s could be detected validating the existence of cos in addition the co2p and s2p core level xps spectra can be seen in fig 3 e f respectively the co2p spectrum can be then deconvoluted into six peaks and specifically the peaks at 780 1 and 795 2 ev corresponded to co3 whereas the peaks located at 781 7 and 796 8 ev shall be ascribed to co2 16 17 on the other hand the s2p spectrum can be also analyzed to show two noticeable underlying peaks and particularly the peak at 162 6 ev corresponded to s2 of cos while the peak occurred in the region of 165 170 ev could be derived from sulfur species existed in the inconsequential formation of coxsy in cosnp 18 as cosnp exhibited the special appearance of cubic bundle of cosnp with the fluffy and wrinkled surfaces its surficial characteristics were then analyzed using n2 sorption isotherms fig 3 g h the resultant isotherm appeared as an iupac type iv isotherm indicating that cosnp might comprise pores possibly derived from voids between nanoplates in cosnp moreover a hysteresis loop could be observed suggesting the existence of mesopores in cosnp which can be then confirmed in the pore size distribution fig 3 h the bet surface area of cosnp was then determined as 33 9 m2 g and the total pore volume was 0 156 cm3 g besides the zeta potentials of cosnp were also determined in fig 3 i and the surface charge of cosnp at ph 3 was 5 mv which gradually decreased with the increasing ph values for instance the zeta potential decreased to 10 mv at ph 5 whereas it further decreased to 17 38 and 62 mv at higher ph 7 9 and 11 respectively this indicated that the surface charge of cosnp tended to be negative at the typical range of ph values 3 2 pbsa degradation by mp activated using cosnp cosnp was then evaluated for its catalytic activity towards mp activation to degrade pbsa as shown in fig 4 a nevertheless since pbsa might be adsorbed to cosnp causing adsorptive removal of pbsa it would be necessary to verify whether adsorption of pbsa to cosnp would occur when cosnp was present the concentration of pbsa remained unchanged over 45 min indicating that cosnp cannot remove pbsa via adsorption moreover when mp was present without any catalysts only a marginal fraction of pbsa was eliminated as merely 10 of pbsa was removed in 45 min however once cosnp was combined with mp the concentration of pbsa quickly decreased over 45 min and its final concentration cf over initial concentration c0 cf c0 approached 0 within 30 min in view of ineffectiveness of mp itself this result validated that mp was activated by cosnp to generate sulfate radicals for degrading pbsa on the other hand since cosnp was derived from comof it would be interesting to compare cosnp with comof for activating mp fig 4 a displays that comof could also activate mp to degrade pbsa as cf c0 approached 0 42 nonetheless the catalytic activity of comof seemed much less than that of cosnp suggesting that the sulfurization treatment was beneficial to comof through its conversion to cosnp furthermore as co3o4 is proven as a reference heterogeneous catalyst for mp commercial co3o4 nanoparticle fig s3 was also tested and compared with cosnp while co3o4 nanoparticle was also capable of activating mp as cf c0 approached 0 8 cosnp certainly outperformed the commercial co3o4 to further compare catalytic activity of cosnp with comof and co3o4 nanoparticle their reaction stoichiometric efficiencies rse were then calculated as rse has increasingly adopted to quantify catalytic activity for activating mp by catalysts through the following equation eq 1 8 19 1 reaction stoichiometric efficiency rse pollutant degrade mole mp added mole the corresponding rse were than displayed in fig 4 b while the amount of mp was the same in each case i e 20 mg 0 131 mmol cosnp could achieve rse 0 027 whereas comof and co3o4 merely reached 0 015 and 0 006 validating that cosnp could utilize mp and convert it more effectively to reactive radicals to degrade pbsa 3 3 effects of cosnp and mp dosages on pbsa degradation while cosnp was proven to activate mp for degrading pbsa it would be necessary to further probe into optimal dosages of cosnp and mp for pbsa degradation hence the effects of cosnp and mp dosages were then investigated in fig 5 firstly the concentration of cosnp was set to 25 50 and 100 mg l while maintaining the concentration of mp to 100 mg l interestingly at these three concentrations of cosnp pbsa could be all completely eliminated in 45 min demonstrating that even though a relatively low concentration of cosnp as 25 mg l could still effectively activate mp to fully degrade pbsa nonetheless the degradation process seemed much faster with a higher concentration of cosnp to further quantify the degradation kinetics the widely employed pseudo 1st order rate law was adopted c t c 0 exp kt 20 and k denotes the pseudo 1st rate constant min 1 of pbsa degradation as k at cosnp 25 mg l was 0 104 min 1 see table s1 it can substantially increase to 0 258 min 1 at cosnp 50 mg l and 0 421 min 1 at cosnp 100 mg l the comparison as the inset validates that a higher concentration of cosnp considerably influenced and enhanced degradation kinetics on the other hand the effect of mp concentration was also varied to 50 100 and 200 mg l while fixing the concentration of cosnp to 100 mg l fig 5 b indicates that a much lower concentration of mp as 50 mg l would lead to incomplete degradation of pbsa and also its corresponding k became noticeably low as shown in the inset in contrast when the concentration of mp increased from 100 to 200 mg l the degradation became notably faster with k increasing from 0 421 to 1 153 min 1 these results demonstrated that mp dosage was critical and sufficient mp dosage was required to achieve full degradation of pbsa whereas a relatively low of cosnp was still useful to activate mp to degrade pbsa satisfactorily 3 4 effects of temperature and initial ph on pbsa degradation next the effect of temperature was then investigated as temperature is a critical factor for mp activation and also pollutant degradation fig 6 a shows pbsa degradation at 30 40 and 50 c and pbsa degradation became even more faster at higher temperatures the k value also increased correspondingly at increasing temperatures as k was raised up from 0 421 at 30 c to 0 619 at 40 c and 1 169 min 1 at 50 c as the upper inset in fig 6 a validating the influential and positive role of elevated temperature to further realize the relationship between temperature and rate constant the arrhenius equation ln k ln a e a rt was adopted and e a is the activation energy e a kj mol of pbsa degradation the corresponding plot of 1 t vs ln k was drawn as the lower inset in fig 6 a and the data points could be well fitted using the linear regression with r2 0 97 and the corresponding e a was determined as 53 2 kj mol furthermore as the solution ph is also crucial to mp activation the effect of ph on pbsa degradation by cosnp mp was then examined in fig 6 b pbsa degradation was slightly influenced under weakly alkaline condition at ph 9 as its corresponding k substantially decreased from 0 421 min 1 at ph 0 to 0 131 min 1 at ph 9 and rse decreased from 0 027 to 0 024 such an unfavorable effect seemed to become more obvious for pbsa degradation under highly alkaline condition at ph 11 as both k and rse became extremely smaller this demonstrated that the highly alkaline condition was adverse towards pbsa degradation possibly because mp can decompose without releasing so4 under alkaline conditions 21 22 as a result deficient so4 was produced to degrade pbsa in addition the alkaline condition tended to make the surface of cosnp more negatively charged because of deposition of hydroxyl ions which made the electrostatic repulsion grow stronger restraining contact between so5 and cosnp on the other hand when the solution was relatively acidic at ph 5 the pbsa degradation was also affected as both k and rse became much smaller this negative effect also grew more obvious when pbsa solution was much more acidic at ph 3 where pbsa was barely degraded this was possibly owing to the fact that mp is highly stable in acidic environments and becomes less likely to be activated 22 based on these results the relatively suitable operational condition for pbsa degradation by cosnp mp was the neutral condition 3 5 the recyclability of cosnp for activating mp to degrade pbsa as a heterogeneous catalyst recyclability of cosnp was certainly crucial and then tested for multi cycle pbsa degradation fig 7 a shows pbsa degradation using the spent cosnp over 4 consecutive cycles and pbsa could be quickly and efficiently degraded in each cycle this validated that the spent cosnp was catalytically active fig 7 b further reveals the xrd pattern of the spent cosnp which was comparable to that of the pristine cosnp in addition we have also measured the co concentration in the solution after the recyclability test of pbsa degradation to examine whether co would be leached out and dissolved in water nevertheless the co concentration in water after the recyclability test was determined as 0 01 mg l by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry which was much lower than the initial concentration of cosnp i e 100 mg l as well as the standard co ion permission in drinking water 0 1 mg l by environmental protection agency epa usa thus cosnp proposed here would not cause the secondary pollution moreover no sulfide could be detected through the spectrophotometric method 23 furthermore the cyanide concentration after the recyclability test was also analyzed using the spectrophotometric method 24 25 for determining whether cyanide ion might be present and derived from cosnp nevertheless cyanide detected in the solution by the spectrophotometric method was below the detection limit suggesting that cyanide was not derived from cosnp for being released into the solution 3 6 a proposed mechanism of pbsa degradation by cosnp activated mp while mp activation typically would produce so4 other reactive oxygen species might be involved in pbsa degradation to further elucidate degradation mechanism of pbsa by cosnp mp the effect of scavenger was then examined by using butanol methanol and nan3 which were probing agents for oh so4 and 1o2 fig 8 a displays that pbsa degradation by cosnp mp in the presence of butanol was noticeably influenced as k decreased from 0 421 to 0 022 min 1 fig 8 b however the pbsa degradation was not completely inhibited as the corresponding rse was 0 02 suggesting that oh might be present but it was not the dominant species the presence of oh might be derived from the direct reaction of so4 with h2o 26 when methanol was then adopted pbsa degradation was almost completely inhibited as k and rse were both close to zero this suggests that so4 participated in pbsa degradation and it played a relatively dominant role in pbsa degradation on the other hand pbsa degradation in the presence of nan3 was then tested and its corresponding k and rse were also substantially decreased suggesting that 1o2 was also present and involved in pbsa degradation for further confirming radical species generated from cosnp mp electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis was employed as shown in fig 8 c when dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent no significant signal was detected from mp dmpo nonetheless when mp and cosnp were combined with dmpo a distinct signal was obtained and attributed to the hyperfine splitting of oxidation adduct products of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 27 32 besides when temp was used as a spin trapping agent in fig 8 d a typical triplet signal which could correspond to temp 1o2 could be gained validating the presence of 1o2 from cosnp mp 33 these results verified that pbsa degradation could be involved with so4 and oh as well as 1o2 generated from cosnp mp through a semi quantitative analysis of radicals present in water 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid 2 htpa and para benzoquinone p bq were employed as probes for determining hydroxyl and sulfate radical respectively the details of the analytic method can be found in the supporting information 34 35 as revealed in fig s4 both hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were both detected through the presence of 2 htpa and p bq derived from reactions of disodium terephthalate with hydroxyl radicals and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid with sulfate radicals respectively the concentrations of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals also increased gradually along with the reaction time however the concentration of hydroxyl radical seemed to be much lower than that of sulfate radical suggesting that sulfate radical might be dominant as seen in the result of the effect of radical scavengers 3 7 a potential degradation pathway for pbsa by cosnp activated mp for further realizing pbsa degradation by cosnp mp intermediates of pbsa degradation were then determined by mass spectrometry fig s5 and summarized in table s4 in view of these intermediates a potential degradation pathway of pbsa by cosnp mp could be proposed in fig 9 at first the benzimidazolate group of pbsa might be oxidized by an oh to become c1 and its analogues subsequently the sulfonate group of c1 and its analogues could be replaced with oh to form c3 which would be then decomposed into c6 pyrocatechol and c7 benzimidamide on the other hand the phenyl group of pbsa could be also oxidized by oh to form c2 which would be then further oxidized to replace its sulfonate group with oh becoming c4 after the bond breakage c4 would be decomposed into c5 and further oxidation would convert both c5 and c7 to c8 hydroquinone or its analogues which would then undergo ring opening reactions forming c9 and eventually other low molecular weight compounds 3 8 estimated cost by cosnp activated mp for pbsa degradation the cost analysis in the system of cosnp activated mp to degrade pbsa has been also calculated and shown in table 1 typically cost analyses of physiochemical wastewater treatments would be calculated based on electricity costs and chemical costs 36 37 in the present study each the implementation of cosnp activated mp process would require the electricity cost 0 130 usd m3 and the chemical cost 0 468 usd m3 leading to a total cost of 0 598 usd m3 as total costs of pollutant degradation processes typically range from 0 3 usd m3 to 3 3 usd m3 36 the total cost of cosnp activated mp process is comparable and even relatively low in comparison with reported values suggesting that cosnp activated mp process would be a promising and feasible technique for eliminating pbsa from water 4 conclusions in this study a unique cubic bundle of cos nanoplate cosnp was prepared through a straightforward sulfurization treatment of comof in the form of co3 co cn 6 2 under very mild conditions this resultant cosnp can show much higher catalytic activities than the pristine comof and the reference catalyst co3o4 nanoparticle for activating mp to degrade pbsa with very low dosages of cosnp 25 mg l and mp 100 mg l 5 mg l of pbsa can be completely removed in 45 min proving that cosnp was a promising catalyst for activating mp to pbsa e a of pbsa degradation by cosnp mp was also determined and the activation mechanism and degradation pathway of pbsa degradation by cosnp mp was

hand the effect of mp concentration was also varied to 50 100 and 200 mg l while fixing the concentration of cosnp to 100 mg l fig 5 b indicates that a much lower concentration of mp as 50 mg l would lead to incomplete degradation of pbsa and also its corresponding k became noticeably low as shown in the inset in contrast when the concentration of mp increased from 100 to 200 mg l the degradation became notably faster with k increasing from 0 421 to 1 153 min 1 these results demonstrated that mp dosage was critical and sufficient mp dosage was required to achieve full degradation of pbsa whereas a relatively low of cosnp was still useful to activate mp to degrade pbsa satisfactorily 3 4 effects of temperature and initial ph on pbsa degradation next the effect of temperature was then investigated as temperature is a critical factor for mp activation and also pollutant degradation fig 6 a shows pbsa degradation at 30 40 and 50 c and pbsa degradation became even more faster at higher temperatures the k value also increased correspondingly at increasing temperatures as k was raised up from 0 421 at 30 c to 0 619 at 40 c and 1 169 min 1 at 50 c as the upper inset in fig 6 a validating the influential and positive role of elevated temperature to further realize the relationship between temperature and rate constant the arrhenius equation ln k ln a e a rt was adopted and e a is the activation energy e a kj mol of pbsa degradation the corresponding plot of 1 t vs ln k was drawn as the lower inset in fig 6 a and the data points could be well fitted using the linear regression with r2 0 97 and the corresponding e a was determined as 53 2 kj mol furthermore as the solution ph is also crucial to mp activation the effect of ph on pbsa degradation by cosnp mp was then examined in fig 6 b pbsa degradation was slightly influenced under weakly alkaline condition at ph 9 as its corresponding k substantially decreased from 0 421 min 1 at ph 0 to 0 131 min 1 at ph 9 and rse decreased from 0 027 to 0 024 such an unfavorable effect seemed to become more obvious for pbsa degradation under highly alkaline condition at ph 11 as both k and rse became extremely smaller this demonstrated that the highly alkaline condition was adverse towards pbsa degradation possibly because mp can decompose without releasing so4 under alkaline conditions 21 22 as a result deficient so4 was produced to degrade pbsa in addition the alkaline condition tended to make the surface of cosnp more negatively charged because of deposition of hydroxyl ions which made the electrostatic repulsion grow stronger restraining contact between so5 and cosnp on the other hand when the solution was relatively acidic at ph 5 the pbsa degradation was also affected as both k and rse became much smaller this negative effect also grew more obvious when pbsa solution was much more acidic at ph 3 where pbsa was barely degraded this was possibly owing to the fact that mp is highly stable in acidic environments and becomes less likely to be activated 22 based on these results the relatively suitable operational condition for pbsa degradation by cosnp mp was the neutral condition 3 5 the recyclability of cosnp for activating mp to degrade pbsa as a heterogeneous catalyst recyclability of cosnp was certainly crucial and then tested for multi cycle pbsa degradation fig 7 a shows pbsa degradation using the spent cosnp over 4 consecutive cycles and pbsa could be quickly and efficiently degraded in each cycle this validated that the spent cosnp was catalytically active fig 7 b further reveals the xrd pattern of the spent cosnp which was comparable to that of the pristine cosnp in addition we have also measured the co concentration in the solution after the recyclability test of pbsa degradation to examine whether co would be leached out and dissolved in water nevertheless the co concentration in water after the recyclability test was determined as 0 01 mg l by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry which was much lower than the initial concentration of cosnp i e 100 mg l as well as the standard co ion permission in drinking water 0 1 mg l by environmental protection agency epa usa thus cosnp proposed here would not cause the secondary pollution moreover no sulfide could be detected through the spectrophotometric method 23 furthermore the cyanide concentration after the recyclability test was also analyzed using the spectrophotometric method 24 25 for determining whether cyanide ion might be present and derived from cosnp nevertheless cyanide detected in the solution by the spectrophotometric method was below the detection limit suggesting that cyanide was not derived from cosnp for being released into the solution 3 6 a proposed mechanism of pbsa degradation by cosnp activated mp while mp activation typically would produce so4 other reactive oxygen species might be involved in pbsa degradation to further elucidate degradation mechanism of pbsa by cosnp mp the effect of scavenger was then examined by using butanol methanol and nan3 which were probing agents for oh so4 and 1o2 fig 8 a displays that pbsa degradation by cosnp mp in the presence of butanol was noticeably influenced as k decreased from 0 421 to 0 022 min 1 fig 8 b however the pbsa degradation was not completely inhibited as the corresponding rse was 0 02 suggesting that oh might be present but it was not the dominant species the presence of oh might be derived from the direct reaction of so4 with h2o 26 when methanol was then adopted pbsa degradation was almost completely inhibited as k and rse were both close to zero this suggests that so4 participated in pbsa degradation and it played a relatively dominant role in pbsa degradation on the other hand pbsa degradation in the presence of nan3 was then tested and its corresponding k and rse were also substantially decreased suggesting that 1o2 was also present and involved in pbsa degradation for further confirming radical species generated from cosnp mp electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis was employed as shown in fig 8 c when dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent no significant signal was detected from mp dmpo nonetheless when mp and cosnp were combined with dmpo a distinct signal was obtained and attributed to the hyperfine splitting of oxidation adduct products of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 27 32 besides when temp was used as a spin trapping agent in fig 8 d a typical triplet signal which could correspond to temp 1o2 could be gained validating the presence of 1o2 from cosnp mp 33 these results verified that pbsa degradation could be involved with so4 and oh as well as 1o2 generated from cosnp mp through a semi quantitative analysis of radicals present in water 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid 2 htpa and para benzoquinone p bq were employed as probes for determining hydroxyl and sulfate radical respectively the details of the analytic method can be found in the supporting information 34 35 as revealed in fig s4 both hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were both detected through the presence of 2 htpa and p bq derived from reactions of disodium terephthalate with hydroxyl radicals and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid with sulfate radicals respectively the concentrations of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals also increased gradually along with the reaction time however the concentration of hydroxyl radical seemed to be much lower than that of sulfate radical suggesting that sulfate radical might be dominant as seen in the result of the effect of radical scavengers 3 7 a potential degradation pathway for pbsa by cosnp activated mp for further realizing pbsa degradation by cosnp mp intermediates of pbsa degradation were then determined by mass spectrometry fig s5 and summarized in table s4 in view of these intermediates a potential degradation pathway of pbsa by cosnp mp could be proposed in fig 9 at first the benzimidazolate group of pbsa might be oxidized by an oh to become c1 and its analogues subsequently the sulfonate group of c1 and its analogues could be replaced with oh to form c3 which would be then decomposed into c6 pyrocatechol and c7 benzimidamide on the other hand the phenyl group of pbsa could be also oxidized by oh to form c2 which would be then further oxidized to replace its sulfonate group with oh becoming c4 after the bond breakage c4 would be decomposed into c5 and further oxidation would convert both c5 and c7 to c8 hydroquinone or its analogues which would then undergo ring opening reactions forming c9 and eventually other low molecular weight compounds 3 8 estimated cost by cosnp activated mp for pbsa degradation the cost analysis in the system of cosnp activated mp to degrade pbsa has been also calculated and shown in table 1 typically cost analyses of physiochemical wastewater treatments would be calculated based on electricity costs and chemical costs 36 37 in the present study each the implementation of cosnp activated mp process would require the electricity cost 0 130 usd m3 and the chemical cost 0 468 usd m3 leading to a total cost of 0 598 usd m3 as total costs of pollutant degradation processes typically range from 0 3 usd m3 to 3 3 usd m3 36 the total cost of cosnp activated mp process is comparable and even relatively low in comparison with reported values suggesting that cosnp activated mp process would be a promising and feasible technique for eliminating pbsa from water 4 conclusions in this study a unique cubic bundle of cos nanoplate cosnp was prepared through a straightforward sulfurization treatment of comof in the form of co3 co cn 6 2 under very mild conditions this resultant cosnp can show much higher catalytic activities than the pristine comof and the reference catalyst co3o4 nanoparticle for activating mp to degrade pbsa with very low dosages of cosnp 25 mg l and mp 100 mg l 5 mg l of pbsa can be completely removed in 45 min proving that cosnp was a promising catalyst for activating mp to pbsa e a of pbsa degradation by cosnp mp was also determined and the activation mechanism and degradation pathway of pbsa degradation by cosnp mp was investigated here to provide valuable understanding about degradation behaviors for developing sulfate radical based processes of pbsa degradation using cobalt sulfide catalysts declaration of

13236,conventional aluminium sulfate as coagulant s inability to effectively meet stringent water quality requirements have created the need to explore enhanced composite coagulants the coagulation efficiency of as and composite as and polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride as pdmdaac coagulants were investigated using jar test and then coupled with rapid sand filtration rsf the various composite as pdmdaac at different intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac and mass ratio of pdmdaac to as in coagulant solutions were optimized and operated at same supernatant turbidity sst or same dosage mode sd the results showed about 7 10 reduction in dosage for all composite as pdmdaac and also improved water qualities compared to as only the patterns of water quality improvements at lower 0 65 dl g medium 1 60 dl g and higher 2 60 dl g intrinsic viscosity of cationic polymer pdmdaac among different mass ratio of pdmdaac to as in the composite mixtures were 5 1 20 1 10 1 10 1 5 1 20 1 20 1 10 1 5 1 respectively the percentage removal efficiencies for as and optimal composite coagulant at intrinsic viscosity 1 60 dl g and mass ratio 10 1 operated at sst or sd after filtration for codmn nh3n and turbidity were 71 20 72 72 73 33 69 15 69 23 73 08 and 93 89 95 07 97 26 respectively it was concluded that enhanced composite as pdmdaac coagulants operated at sst mode showed significant water quality improvement than conventional as having 7 and 31 8 for cod and nh3n removal while operational mode at sd produced more significant water quality improvements than conventional as with 9 49 45 45 and 39 55 for cod nh3n and turbidity removal before filtration respectively more importantly all composite as pdmdaac met stringent water quality requirements before and after filtration this research provided new insight about application of economical and effective alternative composite as pdmdaac coagulant useful in the treatment of water for large population graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aluminium sulfate coagulation efficiency conventional enhanced composite pdmdaac rapid sand filtration 1 introduction safe drinking water is very important to animal and human health the united nation s sustainable development goal 6 is specifically focused on provision of safe drinking water for all 1 2 the common conventional treatments for surface water are coagulation coupled with sand filtration which is widely available and relatively cheap as the world s population continues to increase and with increasing environmental pollution the conventional methods of treating water has failed to meet people s requirements for water quality safety hence the use of enhanced coagulation method had been introduced to achieve the effect of advanced water treatment 3 among the most common coagulants used in conventional water treatments is aluminium sulfate as aluminium sulfate coagulants are widely applied because they are cheap and easy to produce however as coagulants have limitations such as sensitivity to temperature changes the requirement to adjust ph before and after treatments the need to apply higher doses when used alone to meet water quality requirements set by regulatory authorities 4 furthermore weak floc is usually generated containing large amounts of aluminium residues which have been reported to be inimical to human health 5 in recent times the increasing concerns about environmental pollution and public health have made the use of conventional coagulation coupled with sand filtration not effective in meeting the stringent water regulations 6 7 in order to overcome the limitations of conventional water treatment the development and application of enhanced composite coagulants which involve the mixture of pre hydrolyzed inorganic and cationic organic polymers polyelectrolytes have been reported in literatures 5 8 10 the enhanced composite coagulation involving the use of a cationic organic coagulant such as polydimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride pdmdaac in combination with an inorganic coagulant such as poly aluminium chloride pac had been successfully reported in the treatment of taihu lake 8 this method had led over time to an increasing coagulation efficiency resulting into improved removal of water quality parameters such as turbidity codmn and ammonia nitrogen etc the pdmdaac brought about a reduction in the amount of the inorganic coagulants being used no ph change effect and improved floc formation 3 5 11 the pdmdaac used was usually with different intrinsic viscosities and mass ratio of pdmdaac to inorganic salts and the dosage of composite pac pdmdaac used was dependent on several factors such as water source season in which the water was taken and the type of impurities to be removed from the water etc 4 5 the improved performance of enhanced composite coagulants such as pac pdmdaac were reported to be related to the effective destabilization of the negatively charged particles in surface water by both aluminium ions and the highly charged cationic pdmdaac through combination of charge neutralization and adsorption bridging 12 14 also pac pdmdaac coagulant can enhance floc formation and make them settled easily the destabilized particles through encampment adsorption by the aluminium cations aluminium hydroxide precipitates and the large surface area provided by the polymer for adsorption bridging 15 however the amount of pdmdaac in the composite coagulants as well as the intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac must be optimized to achieve improved removal effectiveness and the high cost of existing enhanced composite coagulants have prompted the need for search for relatively cheaper enhanced composite coagulants there are several studies on the application of enhanced composite coagulants or advance and modern process units such as application of membrane ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis adsorption and photo catalysis etc in water treatments which are reported to be expensive required high technical expertise and involved high energy demand 16 23 but we are unaware of any study reported on optimization and enhanced composite coagulant coupled with rapid sand filtration rsf operated at the sst or sd mode which are economical and effective in this paper the coagulation efficiency of as and enhanced composite as pdmdaac were compared before and after coupling with rapid sand filtration the effect of different intrinsic viscosity and mass ratio of pdmdaac in as coagulant solution optimization of composite as pdmdaac coagulant coupled with rapid sand filtration when operated at same supernatant turbidity sst and same dosage sd mode and the mechanism of operations more importantly to achieve improved water quality performances of optimized enhanced composite as pdmdaac compared to as coagulant we are not aware of comparison of coagulation efficiency of as and composite as pdmdaac coupled with rapid sand filtration operated at same supernatant turbidity and same dosage mode in literatures the experimental results will provide additional understanding in the application of composite as pdmdaac coagulants in meeting stringent water quality requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the aluminium sulfate was an industrial product with al2o3 content w w of 15 gongyi fuyuan water purification materials co ltd henan province china pdmdaac were products synthesized in our laboratory with intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 1 60 and 2 60 dl g and solid content of 68 47 76 38 and 71 30 respectively a program controlled jar test apparatus ta6 2 wuhan henling technology co ltd hubei province china and filtration columns were bought from zhong chen instrument co ltd china 2 2 preparation of coagulants the as pdmdaac composite coagulant mixtures with mass ratio of pdmdaac to as at 5 1 10 1 and 20 1 were prepared 9 kinds 5 8 firstly a stock solution of as coagulant containing 7 al2o3 and equivalent to 14 g l of al2o3 was prepared by weighing 93 33 g of as salt into a beaker and dissolved with distilled water to make 200 g solution secondly according to the selected intrinsic viscosity the solid content of pdmdaac and selected mass ratio of composite appropriate amount of pdmdaac was accurately weighed and dissolved in each previously prepared 7 as stock solutions the mixtures were allowed to stand for 24 h and then homogenized by stirring all coagulants were prepared according to literature 24 2 3 rapid sand filtration column preparation and operation for this study laboratory pilot filtration columns were previously designed modified and used accordingly in our research group 18 25 the glass columns used as rapid sand filtration systems were 50 cm long with inner diameter of 4 cm nets were attached at the bottom of each glass columns to prevent passage of sand grains into the filtrate the sizes of sand particles used were in the range 0 6 0 8 mm in order to ensure stability and uniformity of sand beds 58 g of sand particles were weighed and carefully transferred at once into each column to the height of 16 cm below the overflow port the columns packed with sand particles were continuously washed for 20 min to ensure compactness and uniformity finally the flow rates of the columns were kept constant by passing 1 l of water through each column and keeping time almost constant the columns were operated in a down flow mode at a filtration rate of about 1 0 gpm ft2 or 2 5 m h 2 4 the physicochemical parameters of raw water the experiments were conducted with raw water collected from water plant reservoir located along yangtze river in the winter the water quality parameters during the period of study were presented in table 1 2 5 experimental procedures 1 the determination of water quality parameters of raw water at start of all water treatments 2 coagulation efficiency of coagulants was monitored by standard jar tests 8 they were conducted using a program controlled jar test apparatus ta6 2 wuhan henling technology co ltd hubei province china the operation conditions of the jar test were as following stirring for 15 s at 300 r p m before dosage addition fast stirring for 2 min at 300 r p m medium stirring for 2 min at 100 r p m slow stirring for 2 min at 30 r p m and lastly sedimentation for 30 min at 0 r p m the coagulation coupled with rapid sand filtration procedures were as follows 1 firstly residual turbidity of 2 0 ntu was selected as benchmark throughout the study for all coagulants different dosages of as and composite as pdmdaac 9 kinds coagulants were applied to two program controlled jar test apparatus containing 1 0 l of raw water samples one by one twelve curves of the residual turbidity versus dosage were obtained showing the variations of raw water turbidity with coagulant doses the curves are important to get doses corresponding to a baseline residual turbidity of 2 0 ntu that were selected as baseline target 2 in order to ensure that the jar test machines were operating at optimum operational conditions and repeatable a set of 12 beakers were filled with 1 0 l raw water samples appropriate dosages of as and composite as pdmdaac at intrinsic viscosity 0 65 1 60 and 2 60 dl g and mass ratio 5 1 10 1 and 20 1 to meeting the baseline turbidity of 2 0 ntu 3 the supernatants of coagulated water samples were operated firstly at the same supernatant turbidity sst mode and then secondly at the same dosage sd mode of as coagulant collected at 2 cm below each of 12 beakers and eventually a combined volume of 6000 ml was homogenized for rapid sand filtration this was repeated one after another for as and nine kinds of composite as pdmdaac coagulants 4 all the resulting supernatant mixtures were passed right away and one by one through rapid sand columns firstly at height 16 cm or 25 cm the supernatant and filtrates obtained were all measured for water quality improvements 5 the composites as pdmdaac were optimized and operated at sst and sd mode coupled with rsf at sand bed height 16 or 25 cm according to procedure 3 and 4 2 6 analysis methods the turbidity of all samples was measured by using a scatter light turbidimeter qz 201 suzhou qingan instrument co ltd jiangsu province china zeta potential by zeta meter js 94 h shanghai digital technic apparatus co ltd shanghai china the codmn nh3n turbidity and zeta potential were determined as measure of removal efficiency and improved water quality the photomicrographs of as and composite as pdmdaac floc were taken which give insight into the nature of floc 3 results and discussions 3 1 relationship of residual turbidity with coagulant dosages according to experimental procedure 1 the effects of varying coagulant doses on residual turbidity of raw water samples were shown in figs 1 3 and the percentage of pdmdaac in solution of composite as pdmdaac with corresponding dosages at same supernatant of 2 0 ntu were presented in table 2 usually the residual turbidity of finished water samples was mandated by regulations to be less than 1 0 ntu according to national and international water standards 26 the performance of each series of composite as pdmdaac to meet the baseline target can be observed from residual turbidity dosage curves in fig 1 it was observed that composite as pdmdaac with lowest intrinsic viscosity and highest mass ratio 5 1 showed the best performance at meeting the 2 0 ntu target the trend of performance was observed to be 5 1 10 1 20 1 at same viscosity of 0 65 dl g it appeared that at lower intrinsic viscosity the more the amount of pdmdaac in the composite coagulant the better the removal performance at moderate intrinsic viscosity 1 60 dl g the composite as pdmdaac showed a different trend within the different mass ratio for instance when composite as pdmdaac with mass ratio of 5 1 was applied a slight increase in residual turbidity was observed at dosage above 5 mg l in all kind of composite coagulants the best performed composite coagulant was at 1 60 dl g and mass ratio of 10 1 and its performances extended beyond 5 mg l dosage and this was similar to what was reported by zhang and zhao 47 as shown in fig 3 it was observed that the composite coagulant of highest intrinsic viscosity 2 60 dl g and mass ratio 20 1 showed the best performance the observed increase in dosages of composite as pdmdaac at 2 60 dl g may be due to raw water turbidity changes and temperature fluctuations the reasons for these experimental results were that the increase or decrease in coagulant dosages can affect the turbidity of raw water and the series of composite as pdmdaac changes in turbidity depend on intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac and the mass ratio of pdmdaac to as in the mixture 14 table 2 and figs 1 3 3 2 stability and repeatability of operational condition of jar test table 3 represented the statistical analysis of residual turbidity at 2 0 ntu baselines on applying as and as pdmdaac coagulants the operational conditions of the jar test machines such as mixing speed and time were reported to affect the coagulation efficiency 15 the percentage relative standard deviations were less than 5 in all cases the implication was that the operational conditions of the jar test apparatus were stable and repeatable in meeting the selected target and gave the confidence about the performance of each coagulation types table 3 3 3 effect of intrinsic viscosity on the performance of composite coagulants operated at sst mode coupled with rsf the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac at 0 65 dl g 5 1 1 60 dl g 10 1 and 2 60 dl g 20 1 coupled with rsf were shown in figs 4 15 the water quality performance of coagulants depends on raw water parameters and the performances after filtration depend on the efficiency of coagulation process 15 27 the removal efficiencies of all composite as pdmdaac before and after filtration were better than as only with the former having reduced dosages unhindered aluminium contents and no adjustment of ph during coagulation however the intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac in the composite has effect on removal efficiencies generally it is expected that the higher the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer the higher the water quality improvements the results however showed that higher intrinsic viscosity did not always produce best water quality improvements on the contrary the best overall water quality improvements appeared to be achieved when the intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac in the composite coagulants were within the optimal range 3 3 1 behaviour at lower intrinsic viscosity the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac at intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 dl g before and after filtration were shown in figs 4 7 the behaviour of pdmdaac in the composite at lower intrinsic viscosity η follows the general assumption that coagulation efficiency increases as the η of pdmdaac increases the experimental results at η of 0 65 dl g supported this assumption this is because at lower intrinsic viscosity the main mechanism of composite coagulant was reported to be charge neutralization linked to the presence of highly charged cationic pdmdaac 28 it was agreed among some researchers that the higher the intrinsic viscosity the more effective the charge neutralization and the better the coagulation efficiency 28 29 this assumption is only true at lower intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac but may breakdown at higher intrinsic viscosity 3 3 2 behaviour at medium intrinsic viscosity the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac at intrinsic viscosity of 1 60 dl g before and after filtration were shown in figs 8 11 contrary to general assumption in literatures that the higher the intrinsic viscosity η of the polymer the higher coagulation efficiency of the resulting composite coagulant the results of this study showed that the highest water quality improvements occurred when the intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac is within the optimal range the intrinsic viscosity of 1 60 for as pdmdaac composite also shows better water quality filtrate it appeared η at 1 60 dl g was within the optimal range and this may be related to the effective combination of charge neutralization and adsorption bridging mechanism reported as intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac increased and within the optimal range 13 30 the implication is that effective water quality improvements before and after filtration may be linked to optimal intrinsic viscosity and optimal charge density of the pdmdaac in the composite coagulants 28 29 3 3 3 behaviour at higher intrinsic viscosity the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac at intrinsic viscosity of 2 60 dl g before and after filtration were shown in figs 12 15 the behaviour of pdmdaac at higher intrinsic viscosity showed improved water quality performances when compared to as only the results of this study showed that highest η did not give the highest water quality improvements it appears that at higher η of pdmdaac in the composite coagulant there is an optimum dosage for effective coagulation efficiency an overdose of composite coagulant at higher intrinsic viscosity may result in reduced water quality improvements due to over saturation of the particles surface sites by pdmdaac 28 3 4 influence of different mass ratio of pdmdaac to as on performance at different intrinsic viscosity the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac at 0 65 dl g 5 1 1 60 dl g 10 1 and 2 60 dl g 20 1 coupled with rsf were shown in figs 4 15 when the intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 dl g was applied the pattern of water quality improvements nh3n codmn and zeta potential among the different mass ratio of pdmdaac to as in the composite mixture followed 5 1 20 1 10 1 the results showed that the more the amount of pdmdaac in the composite the greater the coagulation efficiency and the overall water quality improvements after filtration this observation may be linked to the fact that at lower intrinsic viscosity the main mechanism of composite coagulant was reported to be charge neutralization due to the presence of highly charged cationic pdmdaac 13 the higher the mass ratio of pdmdaac to as at lower intrinsic viscosity η the more effective the charge neutralization mechanism of composite coagulant the better the particle destabilization resulting in better water quality improvements the zeta potential after filtration from fig 7 indicated that more colloid particles were destabilized when the mass ratio of pdmdaac in the composite was the highest at intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 dl g the pattern for codmn and nh3 n removal using composite as pdmdaac coagulant at mass ratio of 5 1 followed similar pattern as the zeta potential but the turbidity curve in fig 5 showed contrasting trend the observed trend in turbidity may be due to slight fluctuations in filtration rates 31 at medium intrinsic viscosity of 1 60 dl g the pattern of water quality improvements among the different mass ratio followed the trend 10 1 5 1 20 1 the mass ratio 10 1 showed the best removal efficiencies for codmn 65 31 91 83 ammonia nitrogen 25 5 70 58 and turbidity 55 60 95 when coupled with rapid sand filtration this observation may be related to the increased colloid particles destabilization through effective charge neutralization and better settling of particles due to the adsorption bridging through moderate addition of pdmdaac in the composite coagulants 13 when higher intrinsic viscosity of 2 60 dl g was applied the pattern of water quality improvements followed 20 1 10 1 5 1 the results showed that the lesser the amount of pdmdaac in the composite the greater the coagulation efficiency and the overall water quality improvements after filtration there appeared to be a limit to the intrinsic viscosity and amount of pdmdaac that can be applied in the composite coagulant for instance composite coagulant at 2 60 dl g and mass ratio of 5 1 showed least water quality improvements while the mass ratio at 20 1 showed the best improvements zhang et al 8 suggested the need to balance between the cost of pdmdaac coagulation and algae removal efficiencies in practice by using higher intrinsic viscosity at lower mass ratio to attain the same or higher removal performances as composite coagulant with pdmdaac at lower intrinsic viscosity and higher mass ratio the results of this investigation suggested that the application of pdmdaac within the optimal range of intrinsic viscosity in composite as pdmdaac will perform best in coagulation efficiency and improve water quality parameters the zeta potential zp after filtration as indicated in figs 7 11 13 showed that more colloid particles were destabilized through effective charge neutralization when the mass ratio of pdmdaac to as in the composite coagulants were 5 1 at intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 dl g 20 1 at 2 60 dl g and 10 1 at 1 60 dl g respectively the less negative the zp values the more the particles destabilization which indicate the effectiveness of charge neutralization during coagulation and improved water quality parameters after filtration the zeta potential of composite as pdmdaac at 1 60 dl g and mass ratio 10 1 have the least zp values best performance in coagulation efficiency and best improved water qualities 3 5 optimization of enhanced composite as pdmdaac at intrinsic 1 60 dl g mass ratio 5 1 and 10 1 the preliminary experimental results showed that composite as pdmdaac at η 1 60 dl g was within the optimal range and mass ratio 5 1 and 10 1 appeared to have almost equal water quality improvements series of coagulation coupled with rsf were performed to optimized mass ratio at 5 1 and 10 1 and composite at η 1 60 dl g and mass ratio 10 1 showed consistency of having a slight improvement over mass ratio 5 1 this is related to the need for optimal intrinsic viscosity optimal mass ratio and optimal dosage for effective water quality improvements due to combined effective charge neutralization and adsorption bridging mechanism for composite coagulant 30 3 5 1 optimal enhanced composite as pdmdaac operated at sst mode the comparison of as and optimal enhanced composite as pdmdaac coagulant operated at same supernatant turbidity are shown in fig 16 and tables 4 5 dosage reduction of about 8 was observed between conventional as coagulant and optimal composite as pdmdaac operated at sst the implication of dosage reduction will mean the cost of water treatment operations is reduced also composite as pdmdaac uses lesser amount dosage with effective floc compactness the presence of pdmdaac in the mixture coagulant can enhance the floc formation and settlement because of effective charge neutralization and adsorption bridging leading to compactness and reduced volume 5 the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac 1 60 dl g 10 1 operated at sst for codmn and nh3n were 7 and 31 8 respectively in comparison with as coagulation only while the overall water quality improvements when coupled with rsf at sand bed height of 25 cm for codmn nh3n and turbidity removal were 71 20 72 72 69 15 69 23 and 93 89 95 07 respectively the results showed that composite coagulant operated at the sst mode produced better water filtrate than as only these observations agreed with literatures 5 32 33 they reported that enhanced composite coagulant operated at sst mode can improve water quality parameters during coagulation the zeta potential value for as pdmdaac operated at sst 15 07 against 15 35 for as only which is less negative the difference in zp values showed that there was better destabilization of particles through combination of charge neutralization adsorption bridging and the net catching ability of the composite for coagulation process operated at same dosage of as coagulant which implied improved coagulation efficiency and improved water quality for the filtrate this was in line with observations in literatures the less negative the zeta potential of supernatant or filtrate the more effective the particle destabilization resulting in more effective charge neutralization 4 5 34 also the observed better water quality parameters of the filtrate may be linked to improved compactness and settlement of the floc generated through the enhanced composite as pdmdaac compared to as coagulant 15 the literatures reported that strong floc gave better filtrate quality while weak floc led to poor filtrate quality that were subjected to sudden variation 35 36 3 5 2 optimal enhanced composite as pdmdaac operated at sd coupled with rsf the comparison of as and optimal enhanced composite as pdmdaac coagulant operated at same dosage sd are shown in fig 16 17 and tables 4 5 the percentage differences in the water quality improvements for composite as pdmdaac 1 60 dl g 10 1 operated at sd mode over as only for codmn nh3n and turbidity were 9 49 45 45 and 39 5 respectively while the overall water quality improvements when coupled with rsf at sand height 25 cm for codmn nh3n and turbidity were 71 20 73 33 69 15 73 08 and 93 89 97 26 respectively the results showed that composite coagulant operated at the sd mode produced larger water quality filtrate than as only these observations agreed with literatures 5 32 33 although cost may not be reduced at sd operational mode larger and remarkable water quality improvements were observed the zeta potential value for as pdmdaac operated at sd 13 01 against 15 35 for as only showed that there was larger destabilization of particles through combination of charge neutralization and adsorption bridging for coagulation process operated at same dosage which supported the larger improved coagulation efficiency and improved water quality for the filtrate this is in line with observations in literatures the less negative the zeta potential of supernatant or filtrate the more effective the particle destabilization resulting in more effective charge neutralization 4 5 34 also the observed improved water quality improvements of the filtrate may be linked to improved compactness and settlement of the floc generated through the enhanced composite as pdmdaac compared to as coagulant 15 the literatures reported that the stronger the floc the better filtrate quality while weak floc lead to poor filtrate quality that are subject to sudden variation 35 36 3 6 effect of coupling with rapid sand filtration generally the water quality improvements during filtration cycle are in stages namely ripening working and breakthrough stages 25 it was observed that water quality parameters were only slightly improved in the first 2 l of filtrate the working stage 3 4 l showed the best water qualities improvement and they are stable and lastly the breakthrough stage 5 6 l the water quality of the filtrate deteriorates at this stage these patterns are because initially particles are attached to the surface of sand grains and then to previously removed particles acting as collectors leading to improved removal performance over time as the particle deposits increase the velocities through the clogged upper layers of the filter grains also increase and consequently when the shearing forces are equal or greater than the surface chemical attractions the deposited particles are detached and dragged deeper down into the filter grain and the water quality parameters of the filtrate deteriorates 15 37 the observed variations in water quality parameters after filtration may be due to slight fluctuations in filtration rates 31 38 39 literatures have reported that higher filtration rates can result to sudden and poor water quality performance 25 40 41 the overall percentage turbidity removal of 97 after filtration was an evidence of the effectiveness of composite as pdmdaac coupled with rapid sand filtration 3 6 1 effect of change in sand bed height table 5 represents the water quality improvement for composite as pdmdaac at 1 60 dl g 10 1 coupled with rsf at sand bed height 16 or 25 cm before and after filtration the results indicated that improved coagulation efficiency resulted into improved filtration efficiency the results of codmn and turbidity were significantly affected by change in sand bed height remarkably it was observed that increased sand bed height did not notably affect improvement in the removal of ammonia nitrogen and this observation was also reported in literatures 41 42 also nitrogen removal at sand bed height 16 or 25 cm confirmed that other factors may affect the water quality improvements during filtration generally the percentage removal for codmn nh3n and turbidity agreed with literature 41 3 7 mechanism of coagulants in this investigation the comparison of conventional as and series of composite as pdmdaac coupled with rsf were conducted the water quality parameters before and after filtration were used as a measure of performance in all cases the performances of composite as pdmdaac coagulants were better than as coagulants only in literatures the mechanism of inorganic coagulants was reported to be through charge neutralization and sweep flocculation while cationic organic coagulants through charge neutralization and adsorption bridging mechanism 11 29 3 7 1 mechanism of composite as pdmdaac the improved and enhanced performances of composite as pdmdaac may be linked to the more effective destabilization of the negatively charged particles in the raw water samples through the al3 ions and the highly charged cationic pdmdaac resulting in effective charge neutralization and adsorption bridging 43 44 usually particles in surface water are negatively charged while cationic organic polymer coagulants have highly positively charged group the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged particles in the surface water and the highly positive charged pdmdaac caused adsorption bridging and charged neutralization leading into reduced repulsive forces and destabilization the destabilizations of particles caused through the adsorption charge neutralization mechanism are only effective within optimum dosage range 13 32 45 there is a breakdown and re stabilization of particles when there is excess of cationic organic coagulants above the optimum dose causing the zeta potential values to be less positive 34 this was observed when excess composite as pdmdaac at higher intrinsic viscosity and mass ratio of 5 1 resulting in reduced coagulation efficiency in addition the presence of pdmdaac in composite coagulant during coagulation process can cause adsorptions which involve attachments through the surface charges and part of the remaining polymeric chains can form a tail or loop extending into the solution this results into adsorption bridging mechanism when the extended chains find other particles with vacant sites that are not attached to cationic organic polymer in the raw water 13 the adsorption bridging mechanism is effective at improving and enhancing particle destabilization and promotes floc formation and settlement provided that there are particles having vacant sites in summary composite as pdmdaac functions through effective combination of charge neutralization and adsorption bridging mechanism which explains the reason for the observed improved water quality improvements before and after rapid sand filtration 3 8 mechanism of rapid sand filtration the removal of particles within the pores in the sand grains occurred through transport and attachment mechanism which involves the carriage of small particles from the streamlines of the bulk of the supernatant to the distance closer to the sand grain surfaces collectors the interactions between the particles in the supernatant and the sand grains results in surface forces such as electrostatic attraction van der waal force or hydrogen bonding this surface chemical interactions cause the capturing of particles and eventual attachment to the filter grains it was observed that floc from composite as pdmdaac were stronger and the residual pdmdaac in the supernatant may act like a sticky gelatinous polymer on the surface of sand grains generated by microbes which was reported to enhance particle removal during filtration process 46 during the process of particle collection previously removed particles within the pores can also act as collectors it is reported that when the filtration rate is constant the fluid velocities within the pores increase as more particles accumulate 31 these increasing supernatant velocities lead to increase in the dragging force shear force on the deposited particles and when the shear forces reach a critical value equal to or greater than the surface interactive forces adhesive forces then the deposited particles will be detached and they will move to lower depths within the filter bed and subsequently lead to breakthrough filter bed failure 4 conclusions the coagulation process was coupled with rapid sand filtration and the water quality improvements of as and composite as pdmdaac coagulants containing pdmdaac of different intrinsic viscosity and mass ratio were optimized and operated at sst or sd mode the following conclusions were obtained all enhanced composite as pdmdaac coagulants performed better than as coagulant in meeting stringent water quality requirements such as removal of cod nh3n and turbidity the composite as pdmdaac behaved and performed differently depending on the intrinsic viscosity and the mass ratio of pdmdaac to as the following trends were observed among composite as pdmdaac coagulants at intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 dl g mass ratio 5 1 performed best at 2 60 dl g mass ratio 20 1 performed best and finally intrinsic viscosity of 1 60 dl g was within optimal range and mass ratio of 10 1 showed the best performance among all the composites composite as pdmdaac coagulants were optimized when operated at sst or sd mode composite at η of 1 60 dl g and mass ratio 10 1 demonstrated the best performance before and after filtration the overall removal efficiencies were in the range for codmn 65 31 73 33 ammonia nitrogen 25 5 73 08 and turbidity 55 60 97 26 were observed a new insight showed that the best water quality improvements was observed at optimum intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac mass ratio of pdmdaac to as and dosages the enhanced optimal composite as pdmdaac at 1 60 dl g and mass ratio 10 1 operated at same dosage performed with large water quality improvements than same supernatant turbidity however coagulation operated at sst mode showed reduction in dosage and demonstrated potential to save cost the findings provided a new understanding about the application and performance of low medium and high intrinsic

13236,conventional aluminium sulfate as coagulant s inability to effectively meet stringent water quality requirements have created the need to explore enhanced composite coagulants the coagulation efficiency of as and composite as and polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride as pdmdaac coagulants were investigated using jar test and then coupled with rapid sand filtration rsf the various composite as pdmdaac at different intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac and mass ratio of pdmdaac to as in coagulant solutions were optimized and operated at same supernatant turbidity sst or same dosage mode sd the results showed about 7 10 reduction in dosage for all composite as pdmdaac and also improved water qualities compared to as only the patterns of water quality improvements at lower 0 65 dl g medium 1 60 dl g and higher 2 60 dl g intrinsic viscosity of cationic polymer pdmdaac among different mass ratio of pdmdaac to as in the composite mixtures were 5 1 20 1 10 1 10 1 5 1 20 1 20 1 10 1 5 1 respectively the percentage removal efficiencies for as and optimal composite coagulant at intrinsic viscosity 1 60 dl g and mass ratio 10 1 operated at sst or sd after filtration for codmn nh3n and turbidity were 71 20 72 72 73 33 69 15 69 23 73 08 and 93 89 95 07 97 26 respectively it was concluded that enhanced composite as pdmdaac coagulants operated at sst mode showed significant water quality improvement than conventional as having 7 and 31 8 for cod and nh3n removal while operational mode at sd produced more significant water quality improvements than conventional as with 9 49 45 45 and 39 55 for cod nh3n and turbidity removal before filtration respectively more importantly all composite as pdmdaac met stringent water quality requirements before and after filtration this research provided new insight about application of economical and effective alternative composite as pdmdaac coagulant useful in the treatment of water for large population graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aluminium sulfate coagulation efficiency conventional enhanced composite pdmdaac rapid sand filtration 1 introduction safe drinking water is very important to animal and human health the united nation s sustainable development goal 6 is specifically focused on provision of safe drinking water for all 1 2 the common conventional treatments for surface water are coagulation coupled with sand filtration which is widely available and relatively cheap as the world s population continues to increase and with increasing environmental pollution the conventional methods of treating water has failed to meet people s requirements for water quality safety hence the use of enhanced coagulation method had been introduced to achieve the effect of advanced water treatment 3 among the most common coagulants used in conventional water treatments is aluminium sulfate as aluminium sulfate coagulants are widely applied because they are cheap and easy to produce however as coagulants have limitations such as sensitivity to temperature changes the requirement to adjust ph before and after treatments the need to apply higher doses when used alone to meet water quality requirements set by regulatory authorities 4 furthermore weak floc is usually generated containing large amounts of aluminium residues which have been reported to be inimical to human health 5 in recent times the increasing concerns about environmental pollution and public health have made the use of conventional coagulation coupled with sand filtration not effective in meeting the stringent water regulations 6 7 in order to overcome the limitations of conventional water treatment the development and application of enhanced composite coagulants which involve the mixture of pre hydrolyzed inorganic and cationic organic polymers polyelectrolytes have been reported in literatures 5 8 10 the enhanced composite coagulation involving the use of a cationic organic coagulant such as polydimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride pdmdaac in combination with an inorganic coagulant such as poly aluminium chloride pac had been successfully reported in the treatment of taihu lake 8 this method had led over time to an increasing coagulation efficiency resulting into improved removal of water quality parameters such as turbidity codmn and ammonia nitrogen etc the pdmdaac brought about a reduction in the amount of the inorganic coagulants being used no ph change effect and improved floc formation 3 5 11 the pdmdaac used was usually with different intrinsic viscosities and mass ratio of pdmdaac to inorganic salts and the dosage of composite pac pdmdaac used was dependent on several factors such as water source season in which the water was taken and the type of impurities to be removed from the water etc 4 5 the improved performance of enhanced composite coagulants such as pac pdmdaac were reported to be related to the effective destabilization of the negatively charged particles in surface water by both aluminium ions and the highly charged cationic pdmdaac through combination of charge neutralization and adsorption bridging 12 14 also pac pdmdaac coagulant can enhance floc formation and make them settled easily the destabilized particles through encampment adsorption by the aluminium cations aluminium hydroxide precipitates and the large surface area provided by the polymer for adsorption bridging 15 however the amount of pdmdaac in the composite coagulants as well as the intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac must be optimized to achieve improved removal effectiveness and the high cost of existing enhanced composite coagulants have prompted the need for search for relatively cheaper enhanced composite coagulants there are several studies on the application of enhanced composite coagulants or advance and modern process units such as application of membrane ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis adsorption and photo catalysis etc in water treatments which are reported to be expensive required high technical expertise and involved high energy demand 16 23 but we are unaware of any study reported on optimization and enhanced composite coagulant coupled with rapid sand filtration rsf operated at the sst or sd mode which are economical and effective in this paper the coagulation efficiency of as and enhanced composite as pdmdaac were compared before and after coupling with rapid sand filtration the effect of different intrinsic viscosity and mass ratio of pdmdaac in as coagulant solution optimization of composite as pdmdaac coagulant coupled with rapid sand filtration when operated at same supernatant turbidity sst and same dosage sd mode and the mechanism of operations more importantly to achieve improved water quality performances of optimized enhanced composite as pdmdaac compared to as coagulant we are not aware of comparison of coagulation efficiency of as and composite as pdmdaac coupled with rapid sand filtration operated at same supernatant turbidity and same dosage mode in literatures the experimental results will provide additional understanding in the application of composite as pdmdaac coagulants in meeting stringent water quality requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the aluminium sulfate was an industrial product with al2o3 content w w of 15 gongyi fuyuan water purification materials co ltd henan province china pdmdaac were products synthesized in our laboratory with intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 1 60 and 2 60 dl g and solid content of 68 47 76 38 and 71 30 respectively a program controlled jar test apparatus ta6 2 wuhan henling technology co ltd hubei province china and filtration columns were bought from zhong chen instrument co ltd china 2 2 preparation of coagulants the as pdmdaac composite coagulant mixtures with mass ratio of pdmdaac to as at 5 1 10 1 and 20 1 were prepared 9 kinds 5 8 firstly a stock solution of as coagulant containing 7 al2o3 and equivalent to 14 g l of al2o3 was prepared by weighing 93 33 g of as salt into a beaker and dissolved with distilled water to make 200 g solution secondly according to the selected intrinsic viscosity the solid content of pdmdaac and selected mass ratio of composite appropriate amount of pdmdaac was accurately weighed and dissolved in each previously prepared 7 as stock solutions the mixtures were allowed to stand for 24 h and then homogenized by stirring all coagulants were prepared according to literature 24 2 3 rapid sand filtration column preparation and operation for this study laboratory pilot filtration columns were previously designed modified and used accordingly in our research group 18 25 the glass columns used as rapid sand filtration systems were 50 cm long with inner diameter of 4 cm nets were attached at the bottom of each glass columns to prevent passage of sand grains into the filtrate the sizes of sand particles used were in the range 0 6 0 8 mm in order to ensure stability and uniformity of sand beds 58 g of sand particles were weighed and carefully transferred at once into each column to the height of 16 cm below the overflow port the columns packed with sand particles were continuously washed for 20 min to ensure compactness and uniformity finally the flow rates of the columns were kept constant by passing 1 l of water through each column and keeping time almost constant the columns were operated in a down flow mode at a filtration rate of about 1 0 gpm ft2 or 2 5 m h 2 4 the physicochemical parameters of raw water the experiments were conducted with raw water collected from water plant reservoir located along yangtze river in the winter the water quality parameters during the period of study were presented in table 1 2 5 experimental procedures 1 the determination of water quality parameters of raw water at start of all water treatments 2 coagulation efficiency of coagulants was monitored by standard jar tests 8 they were conducted using a program controlled jar test apparatus ta6 2 wuhan henling technology co ltd hubei province china the operation conditions of the jar test were as following stirring for 15 s at 300 r p m before dosage addition fast stirring for 2 min at 300 r p m medium stirring for 2 min at 100 r p m slow stirring for 2 min at 30 r p m and lastly sedimentation for 30 min at 0 r p m the coagulation coupled with rapid sand filtration procedures were as follows 1 firstly residual turbidity of 2 0 ntu was selected as benchmark throughout the study for all coagulants different dosages of as and composite as pdmdaac 9 kinds coagulants were applied to two program controlled jar test apparatus containing 1 0 l of raw water samples one by one twelve curves of the residual turbidity versus dosage were obtained showing the variations of raw water turbidity with coagulant doses the curves are important to get doses corresponding to a baseline residual turbidity of 2 0 ntu that were selected as baseline target 2 in order to ensure that the jar test machines were operating at optimum operational conditions and repeatable a set of 12 beakers were filled with 1 0 l raw water samples appropriate dosages of as and composite as pdmdaac at intrinsic viscosity 0 65 1 60 and 2 60 dl g and mass ratio 5 1 10 1 and 20 1 to meeting the baseline turbidity of 2 0 ntu 3 the supernatants of coagulated water samples were operated firstly at the same supernatant turbidity sst mode and then secondly at the same dosage sd mode of as coagulant collected at 2 cm below each of 12 beakers and eventually a combined volume of 6000 ml was homogenized for rapid sand filtration this was repeated one after another for as and nine kinds of composite as pdmdaac coagulants 4 all the resulting supernatant mixtures were passed right away and one by one through rapid sand columns firstly at height 16 cm or 25 cm the supernatant and filtrates obtained were all measured for water quality improvements 5 the composites as pdmdaac were optimized and operated at sst and sd mode coupled with rsf at sand bed height 16 or 25 cm according to procedure 3 and 4 2 6 analysis methods the turbidity of all samples was measured by using a scatter light turbidimeter qz 201 suzhou qingan instrument co ltd jiangsu province china zeta potential by zeta meter js 94 h shanghai digital technic apparatus co ltd shanghai china the codmn nh3n turbidity and zeta potential were determined as measure of removal efficiency and improved water quality the photomicrographs of as and composite as pdmdaac floc were taken which give insight into the nature of floc 3 results and discussions 3 1 relationship of residual turbidity with coagulant dosages according to experimental procedure 1 the effects of varying coagulant doses on residual turbidity of raw water samples were shown in figs 1 3 and the percentage of pdmdaac in solution of composite as pdmdaac with corresponding dosages at same supernatant of 2 0 ntu were presented in table 2 usually the residual turbidity of finished water samples was mandated by regulations to be less than 1 0 ntu according to national and international water standards 26 the performance of each series of composite as pdmdaac to meet the baseline target can be observed from residual turbidity dosage curves in fig 1 it was observed that composite as pdmdaac with lowest intrinsic viscosity and highest mass ratio 5 1 showed the best performance at meeting the 2 0 ntu target the trend of performance was observed to be 5 1 10 1 20 1 at same viscosity of 0 65 dl g it appeared that at lower intrinsic viscosity the more the amount of pdmdaac in the composite coagulant the better the removal performance at moderate intrinsic viscosity 1 60 dl g the composite as pdmdaac showed a different trend within the different mass ratio for instance when composite as pdmdaac with mass ratio of 5 1 was applied a slight increase in residual turbidity was observed at dosage above 5 mg l in all kind of composite coagulants the best performed composite coagulant was at 1 60 dl g and mass ratio of 10 1 and its performances extended beyond 5 mg l dosage and this was similar to what was reported by zhang and zhao 47 as shown in fig 3 it was observed that the composite coagulant of highest intrinsic viscosity 2 60 dl g and mass ratio 20 1 showed the best performance the observed increase in dosages of composite as pdmdaac at 2 60 dl g may be due to raw water turbidity changes and temperature fluctuations the reasons for these experimental results were that the increase or decrease in coagulant dosages can affect the turbidity of raw water and the series of composite as pdmdaac changes in turbidity depend on intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac and the mass ratio of pdmdaac to as in the mixture 14 table 2 and figs 1 3 3 2 stability and repeatability of operational condition of jar test table 3 represented the statistical analysis of residual turbidity at 2 0 ntu baselines on applying as and as pdmdaac coagulants the operational conditions of the jar test machines such as mixing speed and time were reported to affect the coagulation efficiency 15 the percentage relative standard deviations were less than 5 in all cases the implication was that the operational conditions of the jar test apparatus were stable and repeatable in meeting the selected target and gave the confidence about the performance of each coagulation types table 3 3 3 effect of intrinsic viscosity on the performance of composite coagulants operated at sst mode coupled with rsf the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac at 0 65 dl g 5 1 1 60 dl g 10 1 and 2 60 dl g 20 1 coupled with rsf were shown in figs 4 15 the water quality performance of coagulants depends on raw water parameters and the performances after filtration depend on the efficiency of coagulation process 15 27 the removal efficiencies of all composite as pdmdaac before and after filtration were better than as only with the former having reduced dosages unhindered aluminium contents and no adjustment of ph during coagulation however the intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac in the composite has effect on removal efficiencies generally it is expected that the higher the intrinsic viscosity of the polymer the higher the water quality improvements the results however showed that higher intrinsic viscosity did not always produce best water quality improvements on the contrary the best overall water quality improvements appeared to be achieved when the intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac in the composite coagulants were within the optimal range 3 3 1 behaviour at lower intrinsic viscosity the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac at intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 dl g before and after filtration were shown in figs 4 7 the behaviour of pdmdaac in the composite at lower intrinsic viscosity η follows the general assumption that coagulation efficiency increases as the η of pdmdaac increases the experimental results at η of 0 65 dl g supported this assumption this is because at lower intrinsic viscosity the main mechanism of composite coagulant was reported to be charge neutralization linked to the presence of highly charged cationic pdmdaac 28 it was agreed among some researchers that the higher the intrinsic viscosity the more effective the charge neutralization and the better the coagulation efficiency 28 29 this assumption is only true at lower intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac but may breakdown at higher intrinsic viscosity 3 3 2 behaviour at medium intrinsic viscosity the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac at intrinsic viscosity of 1 60 dl g before and after filtration were shown in figs 8 11 contrary to general assumption in literatures that the higher the intrinsic viscosity η of the polymer the higher coagulation efficiency of the resulting composite coagulant the results of this study showed that the highest water quality improvements occurred when the intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac is within the optimal range the intrinsic viscosity of 1 60 for as pdmdaac composite also shows better water quality filtrate it appeared η at 1 60 dl g was within the optimal range and this may be related to the effective combination of charge neutralization and adsorption bridging mechanism reported as intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac increased and within the optimal range 13 30 the implication is that effective water quality improvements before and after filtration may be linked to optimal intrinsic viscosity and optimal charge density of the pdmdaac in the composite coagulants 28 29 3 3 3 behaviour at higher intrinsic viscosity the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac at intrinsic viscosity of 2 60 dl g before and after filtration were shown in figs 12 15 the behaviour of pdmdaac at higher intrinsic viscosity showed improved water quality performances when compared to as only the results of this study showed that highest η did not give the highest water quality improvements it appears that at higher η of pdmdaac in the composite coagulant there is an optimum dosage for effective coagulation efficiency an overdose of composite coagulant at higher intrinsic viscosity may result in reduced water quality improvements due to over saturation of the particles surface sites by pdmdaac 28 3 4 influence of different mass ratio of pdmdaac to as on performance at different intrinsic viscosity the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac at 0 65 dl g 5 1 1 60 dl g 10 1 and 2 60 dl g 20 1 coupled with rsf were shown in figs 4 15 when the intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 dl g was applied the pattern of water quality improvements nh3n codmn and zeta potential among the different mass ratio of pdmdaac to as in the composite mixture followed 5 1 20 1 10 1 the results showed that the more the amount of pdmdaac in the composite the greater the coagulation efficiency and the overall water quality improvements after filtration this observation may be linked to the fact that at lower intrinsic viscosity the main mechanism of composite coagulant was reported to be charge neutralization due to the presence of highly charged cationic pdmdaac 13 the higher the mass ratio of pdmdaac to as at lower intrinsic viscosity η the more effective the charge neutralization mechanism of composite coagulant the better the particle destabilization resulting in better water quality improvements the zeta potential after filtration from fig 7 indicated that more colloid particles were destabilized when the mass ratio of pdmdaac in the composite was the highest at intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 dl g the pattern for codmn and nh3 n removal using composite as pdmdaac coagulant at mass ratio of 5 1 followed similar pattern as the zeta potential but the turbidity curve in fig 5 showed contrasting trend the observed trend in turbidity may be due to slight fluctuations in filtration rates 31 at medium intrinsic viscosity of 1 60 dl g the pattern of water quality improvements among the different mass ratio followed the trend 10 1 5 1 20 1 the mass ratio 10 1 showed the best removal efficiencies for codmn 65 31 91 83 ammonia nitrogen 25 5 70 58 and turbidity 55 60 95 when coupled with rapid sand filtration this observation may be related to the increased colloid particles destabilization through effective charge neutralization and better settling of particles due to the adsorption bridging through moderate addition of pdmdaac in the composite coagulants 13 when higher intrinsic viscosity of 2 60 dl g was applied the pattern of water quality improvements followed 20 1 10 1 5 1 the results showed that the lesser the amount of pdmdaac in the composite the greater the coagulation efficiency and the overall water quality improvements after filtration there appeared to be a limit to the intrinsic viscosity and amount of pdmdaac that can be applied in the composite coagulant for instance composite coagulant at 2 60 dl g and mass ratio of 5 1 showed least water quality improvements while the mass ratio at 20 1 showed the best improvements zhang et al 8 suggested the need to balance between the cost of pdmdaac coagulation and algae removal efficiencies in practice by using higher intrinsic viscosity at lower mass ratio to attain the same or higher removal performances as composite coagulant with pdmdaac at lower intrinsic viscosity and higher mass ratio the results of this investigation suggested that the application of pdmdaac within the optimal range of intrinsic viscosity in composite as pdmdaac will perform best in coagulation efficiency and improve water quality parameters the zeta potential zp after filtration as indicated in figs 7 11 13 showed that more colloid particles were destabilized through effective charge neutralization when the mass ratio of pdmdaac to as in the composite coagulants were 5 1 at intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 dl g 20 1 at 2 60 dl g and 10 1 at 1 60 dl g respectively the less negative the zp values the more the particles destabilization which indicate the effectiveness of charge neutralization during coagulation and improved water quality parameters after filtration the zeta potential of composite as pdmdaac at 1 60 dl g and mass ratio 10 1 have the least zp values best performance in coagulation efficiency and best improved water qualities 3 5 optimization of enhanced composite as pdmdaac at intrinsic 1 60 dl g mass ratio 5 1 and 10 1 the preliminary experimental results showed that composite as pdmdaac at η 1 60 dl g was within the optimal range and mass ratio 5 1 and 10 1 appeared to have almost equal water quality improvements series of coagulation coupled with rsf were performed to optimized mass ratio at 5 1 and 10 1 and composite at η 1 60 dl g and mass ratio 10 1 showed consistency of having a slight improvement over mass ratio 5 1 this is related to the need for optimal intrinsic viscosity optimal mass ratio and optimal dosage for effective water quality improvements due to combined effective charge neutralization and adsorption bridging mechanism for composite coagulant 30 3 5 1 optimal enhanced composite as pdmdaac operated at sst mode the comparison of as and optimal enhanced composite as pdmdaac coagulant operated at same supernatant turbidity are shown in fig 16 and tables 4 5 dosage reduction of about 8 was observed between conventional as coagulant and optimal composite as pdmdaac operated at sst the implication of dosage reduction will mean the cost of water treatment operations is reduced also composite as pdmdaac uses lesser amount dosage with effective floc compactness the presence of pdmdaac in the mixture coagulant can enhance the floc formation and settlement because of effective charge neutralization and adsorption bridging leading to compactness and reduced volume 5 the water quality parameters for composite as pdmdaac 1 60 dl g 10 1 operated at sst for codmn and nh3n were 7 and 31 8 respectively in comparison with as coagulation only while the overall water quality improvements when coupled with rsf at sand bed height of 25 cm for codmn nh3n and turbidity removal were 71 20 72 72 69 15 69 23 and 93 89 95 07 respectively the results showed that composite coagulant operated at the sst mode produced better water filtrate than as only these observations agreed with literatures 5 32 33 they reported that enhanced composite coagulant operated at sst mode can improve water quality parameters during coagulation the zeta potential value for as pdmdaac operated at sst 15 07 against 15 35 for as only which is less negative the difference in zp values showed that there was better destabilization of particles through combination of charge neutralization adsorption bridging and the net catching ability of the composite for coagulation process operated at same dosage of as coagulant which implied improved coagulation efficiency and improved water quality for the filtrate this was in line with observations in literatures the less negative the zeta potential of supernatant or filtrate the more effective the particle destabilization resulting in more effective charge neutralization 4 5 34 also the observed better water quality parameters of the filtrate may be linked to improved compactness and settlement of the floc generated through the enhanced composite as pdmdaac compared to as coagulant 15 the literatures reported that strong floc gave better filtrate quality while weak floc led to poor filtrate quality that were subjected to sudden variation 35 36 3 5 2 optimal enhanced composite as pdmdaac operated at sd coupled with rsf the comparison of as and optimal enhanced composite as pdmdaac coagulant operated at same dosage sd are shown in fig 16 17 and tables 4 5 the percentage differences in the water quality improvements for composite as pdmdaac 1 60 dl g 10 1 operated at sd mode over as only for codmn nh3n and turbidity were 9 49 45 45 and 39 5 respectively while the overall water quality improvements when coupled with rsf at sand height 25 cm for codmn nh3n and turbidity were 71 20 73 33 69 15 73 08 and 93 89 97 26 respectively the results showed that composite coagulant operated at the sd mode produced larger water quality filtrate than as only these observations agreed with literatures 5 32 33 although cost may not be reduced at sd operational mode larger and remarkable water quality improvements were observed the zeta potential value for as pdmdaac operated at sd 13 01 against 15 35 for as only showed that there was larger destabilization of particles through combination of charge neutralization and adsorption bridging for coagulation process operated at same dosage which supported the larger improved coagulation efficiency and improved water quality for the filtrate this is in line with observations in literatures the less negative the zeta potential of supernatant or filtrate the more effective the particle destabilization resulting in more effective charge neutralization 4 5 34 also the observed improved water quality improvements of the filtrate may be linked to improved compactness and settlement of the floc generated through the enhanced composite as pdmdaac compared to as coagulant 15 the literatures reported that the stronger the floc the better filtrate quality while weak floc lead to poor filtrate quality that are subject to sudden variation 35 36 3 6 effect of coupling with rapid sand filtration generally the water quality improvements during filtration cycle are in stages namely ripening working and breakthrough stages 25 it was observed that water quality parameters were only slightly improved in the first 2 l of filtrate the working stage 3 4 l showed the best water qualities improvement and they are stable and lastly the breakthrough stage 5 6 l the water quality of the filtrate deteriorates at this stage these patterns are because initially particles are attached to the surface of sand grains and then to previously removed particles acting as collectors leading to improved removal performance over time as the particle deposits increase the velocities through the clogged upper layers of the filter grains also increase and consequently when the shearing forces are equal or greater than the surface chemical attractions the deposited particles are detached and dragged deeper down into the filter grain and the water quality parameters of the filtrate deteriorates 15 37 the observed variations in water quality parameters after filtration may be due to slight fluctuations in filtration rates 31 38 39 literatures have reported that higher filtration rates can result to sudden and poor water quality performance 25 40 41 the overall percentage turbidity removal of 97 after filtration was an evidence of the effectiveness of composite as pdmdaac coupled with rapid sand filtration 3 6 1 effect of change in sand bed height table 5 represents the water quality improvement for composite as pdmdaac at 1 60 dl g 10 1 coupled with rsf at sand bed height 16 or 25 cm before and after filtration the results indicated that improved coagulation efficiency resulted into improved filtration efficiency the results of codmn and turbidity were significantly affected by change in sand bed height remarkably it was observed that increased sand bed height did not notably affect improvement in the removal of ammonia nitrogen and this observation was also reported in literatures 41 42 also nitrogen removal at sand bed height 16 or 25 cm confirmed that other factors may affect the water quality improvements during filtration generally the percentage removal for codmn nh3n and turbidity agreed with literature 41 3 7 mechanism of coagulants in this investigation the comparison of conventional as and series of composite as pdmdaac coupled with rsf were conducted the water quality parameters before and after filtration were used as a measure of performance in all cases the performances of composite as pdmdaac coagulants were better than as coagulants only in literatures the mechanism of inorganic coagulants was reported to be through charge neutralization and sweep flocculation while cationic organic coagulants through charge neutralization and adsorption bridging mechanism 11 29 3 7 1 mechanism of composite as pdmdaac the improved and enhanced performances of composite as pdmdaac may be linked to the more effective destabilization of the negatively charged particles in the raw water samples through the al3 ions and the highly charged cationic pdmdaac resulting in effective charge neutralization and adsorption bridging 43 44 usually particles in surface water are negatively charged while cationic organic polymer coagulants have highly positively charged group the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged particles in the surface water and the highly positive charged pdmdaac caused adsorption bridging and charged neutralization leading into reduced repulsive forces and destabilization the destabilizations of particles caused through the adsorption charge neutralization mechanism are only effective within optimum dosage range 13 32 45 there is a breakdown and re stabilization of particles when there is excess of cationic organic coagulants above the optimum dose causing the zeta potential values to be less positive 34 this was observed when excess composite as pdmdaac at higher intrinsic viscosity and mass ratio of 5 1 resulting in reduced coagulation efficiency in addition the presence of pdmdaac in composite coagulant during coagulation process can cause adsorptions which involve attachments through the surface charges and part of the remaining polymeric chains can form a tail or loop extending into the solution this results into adsorption bridging mechanism when the extended chains find other particles with vacant sites that are not attached to cationic organic polymer in the raw water 13 the adsorption bridging mechanism is effective at improving and enhancing particle destabilization and promotes floc formation and settlement provided that there are particles having vacant sites in summary composite as pdmdaac functions through effective combination of charge neutralization and adsorption bridging mechanism which explains the reason for the observed improved water quality improvements before and after rapid sand filtration 3 8 mechanism of rapid sand filtration the removal of particles within the pores in the sand grains occurred through transport and attachment mechanism which involves the carriage of small particles from the streamlines of the bulk of the supernatant to the distance closer to the sand grain surfaces collectors the interactions between the particles in the supernatant and the sand grains results in surface forces such as electrostatic attraction van der waal force or hydrogen bonding this surface chemical interactions cause the capturing of particles and eventual attachment to the filter grains it was observed that floc from composite as pdmdaac were stronger and the residual pdmdaac in the supernatant may act like a sticky gelatinous polymer on the surface of sand grains generated by microbes which was reported to enhance particle removal during filtration process 46 during the process of particle collection previously removed particles within the pores can also act as collectors it is reported that when the filtration rate is constant the fluid velocities within the pores increase as more particles accumulate 31 these increasing supernatant velocities lead to increase in the dragging force shear force on the deposited particles and when the shear forces reach a critical value equal to or greater than the surface interactive forces adhesive forces then the deposited particles will be detached and they will move to lower depths within the filter bed and subsequently lead to breakthrough filter bed failure 4 conclusions the coagulation process was coupled with rapid sand filtration and the water quality improvements of as and composite as pdmdaac coagulants containing pdmdaac of different intrinsic viscosity and mass ratio were optimized and operated at sst or sd mode the following conclusions were obtained all enhanced composite as pdmdaac coagulants performed better than as coagulant in meeting stringent water quality requirements such as removal of cod nh3n and turbidity the composite as pdmdaac behaved and performed differently depending on the intrinsic viscosity and the mass ratio of pdmdaac to as the following trends were observed among composite as pdmdaac coagulants at intrinsic viscosity of 0 65 dl g mass ratio 5 1 performed best at 2 60 dl g mass ratio 20 1 performed best and finally intrinsic viscosity of 1 60 dl g was within optimal range and mass ratio of 10 1 showed the best performance among all the composites composite as pdmdaac coagulants were optimized when operated at sst or sd mode composite at η of 1 60 dl g and mass ratio 10 1 demonstrated the best performance before and after filtration the overall removal efficiencies were in the range for codmn 65 31 73 33 ammonia nitrogen 25 5 73 08 and turbidity 55 60 97 26 were observed a new insight showed that the best water quality improvements was observed at optimum intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac mass ratio of pdmdaac to as and dosages the enhanced optimal composite as pdmdaac at 1 60 dl g and mass ratio 10 1 operated at same dosage performed with large water quality improvements than same supernatant turbidity however coagulation operated at sst mode showed reduction in dosage and demonstrated potential to save cost the findings provided a new understanding about the application and performance of low medium and high intrinsic viscosity of pdmdaac in composite coagulant for the treatment of source water for large population declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13237,according to the united nations report billions of people particularly those living in regional areas places that lay behind major cities are still lacking access to clean drinking water some of them drink rainwater without any prior treatment even though water experts are campaigning against this practice for potential health risks as most of the previous studies have focused on the use of harvested rainwater for non potable usage the present study reports the feasibility of producing drinking water from an integrated rainwater harvesting unit it is found that the developed unit can produce clean drinking water for households in rural communities the economic payback time for the proposed unit is eight years at a water production cost of au 0 07 l important quality parameters of the produced drinking water such as ph electrical conductivity ammonia nitrite nitrate total organic carbon turbidity faecal coliforms escherichia coli heavy metals and total trihalomethanes are examined using a testing facility accredited by the national association of testing authorities from australia it is found that the water quality complies with the requirements specified in the australian drinking water guidelines the developed integrated rainwater harvesting unit could produce drinking water at a capacity of 348 20 l in a day since it is important to store the produced drinking water for potential dry periods suitable methods for disinfection and mineral fortification of the produced water are presented finally a detailed description of the step by step installation of the proposed system is presented this study can potentially contribute to goal 6 clean water and sanitation of united nations sustainable development goals graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rainwater harvesting water quality treatment clean water drinking water payback time 1 introduction while there are instances that the quality of freshwater resources are improving in some regions many places especially in developing countries have been experiencing a substantial decline in the last few decades posing serious threats to the safety of drinking water 13 32 according to united nations water un water approximately two billion people representing one third of the global population are living in countries experiencing severe water stress 30 in most of the developing and underdeveloped regions access to safe drinking water is still a luxury according to the world health organisation around 844 million people who are mostly poor do not have a basic potable water supply and 663 million people are using water that does not meet the standards for human consumption 34 the above mentioned facts and statistics motivate researchers to identify and utilise alternative water resources that are sustainable in nature rainwater harvesting rwh is one of the traditional methods to collect and store water for future usage recently the technology has attracted many researchers attention to tackling the increasing water demand in urban areas 4 25 the use of harvested rainwater for non potable usage can reduce the water demand from a central water supply system considerably 8 24 in addition capturing rainfall runoff can minimise pressure on the stormwater management system immensely 17 22 however little attention has been given to the potential use of rwh for drinking water production in rural areas where a centralised water supply system is not available 4 a number of studies have suggested that rainwater should not be consumed without treatment although this is the current practice in many countries including rural australia 31 cubaka et al 9 recently investigated the quality of roof harvested drinking water in the adelaide region australia they collected and tested water samples from 53 tanks and found escherichia coli e coli in 28 of them representing a high percentage of 53 it is reported that mounted tv antennas on building rooftops and hanging canopies could increase the chance of rainwater microbial contamination the authors advised a need of proper treatment of rainwater before human consumption in bangladesh rwh systems have been promoted in many rural areas where either groundwater is contaminated with arsenic or salinity makes the water undrinkable 7 however the health risk associated with the drinking of untreated rainwater has largely been ignored as people believe that rainwater is naturally clean and safe for human consumption in addition previous research has suggested that there is a cardiovascular health risk for people with regular consumption of rainwater since the rainwater lacks many essential minerals that are usually available in groundwater 20 studies on how these minerals can be added to harvested rainwater at the household level are limited in this research a comprehensive method has been proposed to solve the issue related to the filtration of rainwater to make it drinkable meanwhile the possible addition of minerals is recommended to provide essential minerals lacking in the rainwater while identifying a sustainable source of water supply is crucial adequate treatment technology is also essential to make the water drinkable in urban areas a centralised water treatment system is generally adopted however there are some serious concerns associated with the long term maintenance and environmental viability of these systems particularly in developing countries 6 in rural areas additional hurdles related to the water distribution system and associated high cost prevent the adoption of such a central water supply system therefore in rural areas experts suggest decentralised water treatment systems to serve individual households 5 11 19 27 schumann et al 27 evaluated the performance of a gravity driven membrane system for a decentralised drinking water treatment system and concluded that the system could produce drinking water with a production rate of 50 l day similarly a decentralised greywater treatment system was proposed for rural areas of india 28 the system was reported to treat greywater derived from handwash and kitchen wash effectively contaminants removal efficiencies were between 66 and 99 99 and the system was found to be economical therefore it can be argued that combining a decentralised water treatment system with a rwh system could effectively produce drinking water for rural households as rainwater is generally fresh in nature and can easily be collected and stored however information about such a rwh system cannot be found in the existing literature this motivated the authors to make a decentralised water treatment system and attach it to a rainwater harvesting system to configure an integrated rainwater harvesting unit irwhu that can produce drinking water in rural areas to the authors best knowledge a irwhu for drinking water production at the household level has rarely been tested in terms of water quality quantity and economic feasibility here a irwhu represents a compact system that collects rainwater from roof catchment and produces drinking water for an individual household an analogy can be made with a solar panel where the panel receives sunlight and produces electricity for the household in addition although there are several studies on the harvested rainwater quality at large scale peer reviewed research articles on the preservation of produced drinking water and methods for disinfection and mineral fortification at household level are limited which represents a significant research gap therefore the present study aims to investigate the feasibility of a irwhu in producing drinking water at the household level meanwhile preservation and methods for disinfection and mineral fortification are also presented for the proposed system the primary objectives of this study are to i examine the technical viability of a irwhu that can produce drinking water for a household ii examine the water quality produced from the developed irwhu and check the compliance to the australian drinking water guidelines adwgs iii identify appropriate methods for preservation disinfection and additional mineral fortification and iv evaluate the economic feasibility of the proposed system 2 materials and methods 2 1 site location and description of the irwhu the irwhu was constructed on the werrington south campus of western sydney university wsu in new south wales australia 33 46 13 5 s 150 44 32 2 e the site is close to the regional area of western sydney and people living approximately 20 km away from the selected site are drinking rainwater without treatment the developed irwhu is shown in fig 1 left the irwhu consists of guttering and downpipe systems to collect and convey rainwater from the roof catchment to a first flush device in connection with the installed rainwater tank in this study a plastic tank with a volume of 2 kl is used for the collection and primary storage of harvested rainwater the tank size is selected based on a water balance model reported by the authors earlier 4 the tank is supported using recycled steel posts in the form of a truss structure it should be noted that the support can also be made using other locally available materials such as brick bamboo or timber the lifted tank allows the use of gravity as the driving force for the water to flow from the tank to the filter system which helped to avoid the installation of a water pump and the use of electricity to run the pump the dimensions of the installed rainwater tank can be seen in fig 1 right the tank material is food grade which is a requirement from the australian government all the plumbing materials and accessories with a possibility of contact with rainwater are also made of food grade materials a first flush device and two separate screens are also installed to divert the initial uncleaned water from the roof and obstruct large contaminants such as leaves and insects entering into the rainwater tank respectively 2 2 rainfall monitoring local rainfall pattern is one of important parameters in developing the water balance model in this study local rainfall pattern has been recorded by installing a rain gauge on the site as shown in fig 2 a fig 2b shows the information receiver which can read store and show the data on the monitor the installed piezometer is shown in fig 2c which is used to determine the level of water in the tank 2 3 design and construction of gravity fed water filtration unit the schematic of the developed gravity fed filtration unit is shown in fig 3 left in which sand charcoal cheesecloth limestone and gravel are used as filtration materials to find out the best arrangement for the filtration materials a number of combinations were tested and the results have been reported elsewhere 1 according to the authors the filter chamber should be filled with gravel cheesecloth sand limestone charcoal and small gravel from the bottom to the top a photo of the configured filter is shown in fig 3 right the construction materials of the irwhu are selected based on a number of factors firstly all materials in contact with the harvested water should be food grade to avoid any potential health risks secondly the lining of the tank material must not include any animal derived compounds which might conflict with some social values of specific community such as vegan people lastly the filter materials including gravels charcoals limestone sand and cheesecloth steel mesh must be washed thoroughly before placing into the filter chamber it is recommended that the filter materials should be purchased from reliable suppliers to ensure good quality sand and gravels need to be soaked for 48 h before washing them thoroughly it is also recommended that an initial trial of 48 h should be maintained before the filter is used for practical application in the following the performance of the developed filter is evaluated in terms of water quality and quantity 2 4 sampling water samples were either collected from the rainwater tank directly referred to as before filtration or from the outlet of the filtration unit referred to as after filtration the samples were brought to the wsu s environmental lab and preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c before testing tap water was also tested for comparison purposes samples were collected weekly every time a total of nine samples were collected representing samples before filtration after filtration and from the nearby tap respectively the experiment was run for four consecutive months 2 5 analytical procedure a gallery automated photometric analyser thermo scientific is used to determine the concentrations of nitrate nitrites and ammonia the details of the testing procedure can be found elsewhere 18 the ph of the collected samples was determined using a hach hq40d portable multi meter a shimadzu total organic carbon analyser toc l csh csn is used to determine the total organic carbon toc the detection limit of the toc analyser is 4 μg l the testing parameters were selected based on the adwgs and the priority parameters tested regularly by the local water distribution company moreover samples were also sent to and tested by als global accredited by the national association of testing authorities nata all precautionary procedures were followed during the sample delivery to als global to make sure that the test conditions were not compromised 2 6 life cycle cost analysis a life cycle cost analysis lcca has been performed to determine the economic viability of the proposed irwhu system in the analysis all economic and financial flows at different times have been converted into present day values the lcca analysis is conducted based on nominal costs and the discount rate method and the details are given elsewhere 2 14 table 1 presents the actual costs of different items used in the construction of the practical irwhu system on wsu s werrington south campus in this study we have compared the lcca results between the actually constructed system and the designed system to understand the difference in economic feasibility analyses in different stages since some items might be overlooked in the design stage the comparison is useful to understand any hidden costs which should be incorporated in future lcca 2 7 design requirement there are two important parameters that should be examined to evaluate the technical feasibility of a household level drinking water production and supply system the first of these is that the system should be able to produce a sufficient amount of drinking water to fulfil the demand of a household throughout the year the second requirement is that the quality of the produced water should satisfy the national standards for drinking water therefore suitable storage and disinfection methods should be adopted to ensure the quality of the water for a required period we have investigated all these issues and the results are discussed in the following section 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quantity and quality fig 4 a shows the water production capacity of the developed irwhu system equipped with the filter unit described in section 2 3 the irwhu system run continuously for six hours and the hourly water production rate was evaluated accordingly as can be seen the water production rates are in the range of 14 2 16 8 l h based on the data the average filtration capacity of the developed irwhu system is calculated to be 14 5 l h or 348 l day with an uncertainty within 5 a long term monitoring was further conducted to check the water production capacity of the system within four months and the results are shown in fig 4 b during this measurement the irwhu system was left running continuously and the water production data were collected on the first day of the following month as we can see the water production rates in the four consecutive months are 16 8 15 65 16 and 14 85 l h respectively it seems that the collected rainwater in the storage tank is relatively clean which can be attributed to the installation of the first flush chamber and the filtration unit it should also be noted that there are not many tall trees around the roof which makes it a decent site for rainwater harvesting 29 the filter cartridge was not blocked even after the continuous filtration for four months however after four months the experiment had to be stopped because some sand particles were found in the filtered water after checking the filter unit it was found that the cheesecloth started to degrade allowing the sand particles to pass through it is therefore recommended that the cheesecloth should be replaced by food grade stainless steel mesh to ensure durability besides the presence of sand particles in the filtered water might be solved by layering finer sand on the top of coarser sand in the tube this will be adopted in future as a further development of the system this can also address the concern that the cheesecloth might promote microbial growth in the long run though the stored water in the rainwater tank is found to be relatively clear this is not the case for the first flush runoff in the beginning of the rainfall event a significant amount of dirt was found in the first flush chamber as can be seen in fig 5 after two rainfall events the two rainfall events are referred to as event 1 and event 2 respectively for event 1 the rain occurred after 46 dry days whilst event 2 occurred only after 6 dry days the accumulated amounts of dirt in the first flush chamber were found to be 9 3 and 3 8 g after events 1 and 2 respectively the study argues that a first flush chamber is necessary for the irwhu system the quality of the filtered water was studied first at the environmental lab of western sydney university and the test results are shown in table 2 tests were also conducted on tap water for comparison purposes the results of the produced water and tap water are also presented in table 2 as can be seen in table 2 ph of the rainwater after filtration and tap water comply with the adwgs however ph of the rainwater before filtration is lower than the recommended value in adwgs as expected 35 inclusion of limestone in the filter column has effectively increased the ph of the water electrical conductivity of the harvested rainwater both before and after filtration was much lower than the recommended level in adwgs this is because rainwater lacks minerals which are often found in groundwater 21 the issue of shortage of minerals in rainwater is addressed in section 3 3 ammonia nh3 concentration in the unfiltered rainwater is high which could be attributed to the presence of feces of birds rodents dead insects and or rotten leaves on the roof however the concentration level of nh3 reduced significantly after filtration other parameters such as no2 no3 total organic carbon toc and turbidity are within the adwg limits for all tested samples the filtered rainwater was further tested at one of australia s nata 1 1 national association of testing authorities accredited lab in sydney als global this is because nata accreditation is important for this research since the produced water would be used for human consumption the test results are shown in table 3 in which the parameters are those reported by sydney water the water supplying company in sydney australia regularly for drinking water the fourth column in table 3 presents the limits of different parameters specified by adwgs as we can see that all the parameters for the filtered rainwater comply with the adwgs except the iron content this is because of the rust that occurred on the surface of the corrugated steel roof and or the low ph of rainwater to dissolve iron moreover the results obtained from the wsu s environmental lab are in good agreement with the results from als global for ph dissolved oxygen and no2 no heavy metals are above the recommended limits in adwgs the colour hardness and turbidity of the filtered water comply with the guidelines which indicates that the filtering materials have been selected properly for treating rainwater a microbiological test for the filtered water was also conducted at als global as can be seen in table 3 the tested sample has a level of e coli less than 1 cfu 100 ml which is the standard set in adwgs it should be noted that the absence of e coli does not necessarily mean that the water would never be contaminated the quality of the filtered water has to be monitored regularly to detect potential contamination by pathogens with increasing storage time also if the water contains a high amount of toc total organic carbon the probability of microbial organism growth is high over time the best approach to tackle this issue is to disinfect the water before consumption there are several ways for doing this including chlorination and uv and ozone disinfection each of these disinfection methods has its own merits and demerits the chlorination method is highly effective and cost effective since they are readily available and have a residual effect while uv disinfection requires a special design to apply an appropriate dosage of uv light also pre filtration is required for effective uv light penetration moreover there is a power supply requirement for uv disinfection and no residual effect can be obtained by using this method in a rural area this can be a challenge as for ozone disinfection there is a concern that by products produced in this method are susceptible to carcinogens 4 considering the scale and installation site of the proposed irwhu chlorination seems to be the most suitable method to disinfect filtered rainwater 12 however the correct dosage of chlorine is crucial because a high dosage might affect human health in this study we have determined the safe limit of chlorine dosing in the rainwater 3 2 disinfection by chlorination and storage the concept of chlorination is to add chlorine into the water which would kill the germs and disinfect the water two types of chemicals are usually used for chlorination purpose i sodium hypochlorite solution naocl and ii solid calcium hypochlorite ca ocl 2 in this study naocl is used since it is cost effective and locally available and can be easily mixed with water a high dose of this chemical is harmful to human health therefore the breakpoint chlorination curve is drawn in fig 6 a using experimental data to select the appropriate dose that would be sufficient to kill the germs to run this experiment diluted chlorine 1 mg l 1 ppm is added to the filtered water in every 3 min and the residual chlorine mg l is determined using a hach dr1900 diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd colorimetric method spectrophotometer 26 in fig 6 a each data point represents the addition of 1 mg l diluted chlorine solution into the water at that moment the interval between two data points are three minutes as can be seen in fig 6 a residual chlorine could be detected once diluted chlorine solution was added into the filtered water at first dosing the residual chlorine was 0 7 0 035 mg l while after second dosing the level increased to 0 86 0 043 mg l it seemed that in the beginning the residual was lower than the dosing since a certain amount of chlorine was consumed in destroying the organic matters presented in the water according to adwgs the maximum acceptable limit of chlorine in drinking water is 5 mg l looking at the test results reported by sydney water it seems that the chlorination level of their water is always kept within 1 3 mg l to comply with the sydney water standard it is recommended that a dosing level of 3 mg l would keep the water safe for drinking however it should be noted that the recommendation can vary depending on the location of the irwhu system since the organic matters may vary place to place after the determination of the dosing level it is important to determine the detention time for chlorination in this study the detention time has been determined experimentally as shown in fig 6 b the first 10 min were crucial for the process where 21 67 of the dilute chlorine solution had been used to disinfect the water after 15 min of chlorination it seemed that the level of chlorine became almost stable however it is recommended that 30 min should be given for the chlorination 15 16 in our work an additional test has been conducted to investigate how the residual chlorine varies with time fig 6 c represents the degradation of residual chlorine over time in this test the filtered water was chlorinated in the beginning with an arbitrary amount of diluted chlorine solution 6 0 3 mg l after that the chlorinated water was stored in a water container and kept in a dark place at room temperature for several weeks this is to simulate the situation where the irwhu owner disinfects the produced drinking water and stores it in indoor environment for future use at 10 00 am of every tuesday a 10 ml sample was collected from the container and tested for residual chlorine the results are shown in fig 6 c as we can see the chlorine concentration reduced significantly over time after six weeks the chlorine level dropped from 6 0 3 to 0 52 0 26 mg l a total of 79 5 of the chlorine solution had been consumed in first three weeks the continuous reduction of the chlorine concentration could be attributed to the slow reaction between chlorine and other compounds in the water as suggested by clark and sivaganesan 10 therefore if one wants to store the filtered water for a long period of time an immediate chlorination after filtration is not recommended instead the chlorination might be done just one day prior to the consumption of the stored water from fig 6 c it can be argued that the chlorinated water may stay drinkable for at least a week according to the who chlorine should add at least 30 min of contact time with water to disinfect the filtered water 33 3 3 additional mineral fortification 3 3 1 sodium fortification one of the essential minerals in our regular diet is sodium the most common source of this mineral is from cooking salt which has no smell and can easily dissolve in water however the taste of the water becomes salty when the level of the salt is greater than 180 mg per litre usually the salt intake is related to the consumption of food instead of drinking water nonetheless adding cooking salt into rainwater may improve the overall mineral level according to the government of western australia sodium is essential for normal functioning of the human body and it is not generally considered harmful at normal levels of intake from combined food and drinking water sources 23 the addition of cooking salt into harvested rainwater and the corresponding changes in ph electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen is shown in fig 7 the sample is prepared by adding 90 mg of cooking salt into one litre of filtered rainwater as can be seen in fig 7 the addition of cooking salt into rainwater improved the electrical conductivity from 35 5 to 252 μs cm which is very close to the corresponding value of the sydney tap water 262 μs cm this could be attributed to the addition of free ions in water as a result of cooking salt addition the changes in ph and electrical conductivity due to cooking salt addition were 1 and 2 3 respectively which were insignificant 3 3 2 healthy dietary requirement the presence of dissolved minerals in the rainwater is quite low however there are a number of minerals such as calcium magnesium iron and fluoride that are crucial for health drinking of harvested rainwater in a regular basis would be a concern for a mineral deficient diet therefore a proper diet should be maintained to get all these essential nutrients coming from the food for example dairy products and fruits like orange blackberries strawberries and raspberries are good sources of calcium in addition green vegetables such as spinach kale broccoli avocado peas cabbage green beans artichokes asparagus and brussels sprouts are prominent sources for magnesium and calcium seafood like salmon mackerel and tuna are rich in magnesium fluoride which is one of the important nutrients that strengthen and re mineralise damaged enamel lacks in rainwater for small scale water production systems such as ours adding fluoride is not recommended because the treatment method is complex and inappropriate handling of fluoride might result in a substantial health hazard however foods like spinach grapes raisins blue crab black tea russet potatoes and prawns are good sources for fluoride 3 4 lcca of irwhu the economic benefit of the proposed irwhu system can be determined by lcca the results are compared with our previously reported findings from a feasibility study conducted at the beginning of this research 3 factors responsible for inconsistency in the results are identified and discussed the lcca results for the actual and modelled irwhus are presented and compared in fig 8 as we can see payback periods for the modelled and practical irwhus are one and eight years respectively considering the produced water with a price of au 7 0 l in both cases the significant shift in the payback period for the practical system is due to a number of hidden costs that were not foreseen during the modelling since the modelling was performed based on literature reports where these types of costs had been rarely reported it is argued that the knowledge of these costs from this study would help future researchers to model a system more precisely the major cost differences between a model and practical irwhus are shown in the inset of fig 8 as we can see construction of the foundation and plumbing and labour costs are almost three times and two times higher than what we have budgeted during modelling respectively the significant difference in foundation cost is because of a number of hidden costs such as excavation for the foundation hiring rubbish bin removal of the rubbish bin levelling formwork and temporary fencing at the work area for safety during modelling for the foundation the only cost for concrete was considered a considerable cost difference is also noticeable for plumbing and labour in modelling the length of plumbing and the time required for plumbing were considered however in practical installation additional costs related to the travelling of the plumber and new guttering system had to be included in the lcca therefore the water production cost from the practical irwhu was au 4 l while a production cost of au 1 07 l was reported for the irwhu model 3 further research is needed to optimise the foundation design to reduce the construction cost to increase the economic benefits of the proposed system 3 5 step by step guide for the

water was investigated it was found that early chlorination of water was not effective if the intention was to store the water for more than three weeks as chlorine degraded considerably with time it is recommended that chlorination should be done a day prior to the consumption of filtered water sodium hypochlorite can be used as a disinfectant and the chlorine dosage should not exceed 3 mg l the lcca revealed that the actual cost of the produced drinking water from the developed irwhu system is au 0 04 l if the system owner chooses to sell the produced drinking water at a price of au 0 07 l

13237,according to the united nations report billions of people particularly those living in regional areas places that lay behind major cities are still lacking access to clean drinking water some of them drink rainwater without any prior treatment even though water experts are campaigning against this practice for potential health risks as most of the previous studies have focused on the use of harvested rainwater for non potable usage the present study reports the feasibility of producing drinking water from an integrated rainwater harvesting unit it is found that the developed unit can produce clean drinking water for households in rural communities the economic payback time for the proposed unit is eight years at a water production cost of au 0 07 l important quality parameters of the produced drinking water such as ph electrical conductivity ammonia nitrite nitrate total organic carbon turbidity faecal coliforms escherichia coli heavy metals and total trihalomethanes are examined using a testing facility accredited by the national association of testing authorities from australia it is found that the water quality complies with the requirements specified in the australian drinking water guidelines the developed integrated rainwater harvesting unit could produce drinking water at a capacity of 348 20 l in a day since it is important to store the produced drinking water for potential dry periods suitable methods for disinfection and mineral fortification of the produced water are presented finally a detailed description of the step by step installation of the proposed system is presented this study can potentially contribute to goal 6 clean water and sanitation of united nations sustainable development goals graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rainwater harvesting water quality treatment clean water drinking water payback time 1 introduction while there are instances that the quality of freshwater resources are improving in some regions many places especially in developing countries have been experiencing a substantial decline in the last few decades posing serious threats to the safety of drinking water 13 32 according to united nations water un water approximately two billion people representing one third of the global population are living in countries experiencing severe water stress 30 in most of the developing and underdeveloped regions access to safe drinking water is still a luxury according to the world health organisation around 844 million people who are mostly poor do not have a basic potable water supply and 663 million people are using water that does not meet the standards for human consumption 34 the above mentioned facts and statistics motivate researchers to identify and utilise alternative water resources that are sustainable in nature rainwater harvesting rwh is one of the traditional methods to collect and store water for future usage recently the technology has attracted many researchers attention to tackling the increasing water demand in urban areas 4 25 the use of harvested rainwater for non potable usage can reduce the water demand from a central water supply system considerably 8 24 in addition capturing rainfall runoff can minimise pressure on the stormwater management system immensely 17 22 however little attention has been given to the potential use of rwh for drinking water production in rural areas where a centralised water supply system is not available 4 a number of studies have suggested that rainwater should not be consumed without treatment although this is the current practice in many countries including rural australia 31 cubaka et al 9 recently investigated the quality of roof harvested drinking water in the adelaide region australia they collected and tested water samples from 53 tanks and found escherichia coli e coli in 28 of them representing a high percentage of 53 it is reported that mounted tv antennas on building rooftops and hanging canopies could increase the chance of rainwater microbial contamination the authors advised a need of proper treatment of rainwater before human consumption in bangladesh rwh systems have been promoted in many rural areas where either groundwater is contaminated with arsenic or salinity makes the water undrinkable 7 however the health risk associated with the drinking of untreated rainwater has largely been ignored as people believe that rainwater is naturally clean and safe for human consumption in addition previous research has suggested that there is a cardiovascular health risk for people with regular consumption of rainwater since the rainwater lacks many essential minerals that are usually available in groundwater 20 studies on how these minerals can be added to harvested rainwater at the household level are limited in this research a comprehensive method has been proposed to solve the issue related to the filtration of rainwater to make it drinkable meanwhile the possible addition of minerals is recommended to provide essential minerals lacking in the rainwater while identifying a sustainable source of water supply is crucial adequate treatment technology is also essential to make the water drinkable in urban areas a centralised water treatment system is generally adopted however there are some serious concerns associated with the long term maintenance and environmental viability of these systems particularly in developing countries 6 in rural areas additional hurdles related to the water distribution system and associated high cost prevent the adoption of such a central water supply system therefore in rural areas experts suggest decentralised water treatment systems to serve individual households 5 11 19 27 schumann et al 27 evaluated the performance of a gravity driven membrane system for a decentralised drinking water treatment system and concluded that the system could produce drinking water with a production rate of 50 l day similarly a decentralised greywater treatment system was proposed for rural areas of india 28 the system was reported to treat greywater derived from handwash and kitchen wash effectively contaminants removal efficiencies were between 66 and 99 99 and the system was found to be economical therefore it can be argued that combining a decentralised water treatment system with a rwh system could effectively produce drinking water for rural households as rainwater is generally fresh in nature and can easily be collected and stored however information about such a rwh system cannot be found in the existing literature this motivated the authors to make a decentralised water treatment system and attach it to a rainwater harvesting system to configure an integrated rainwater harvesting unit irwhu that can produce drinking water in rural areas to the authors best knowledge a irwhu for drinking water production at the household level has rarely been tested in terms of water quality quantity and economic feasibility here a irwhu represents a compact system that collects rainwater from roof catchment and produces drinking water for an individual household an analogy can be made with a solar panel where the panel receives sunlight and produces electricity for the household in addition although there are several studies on the harvested rainwater quality at large scale peer reviewed research articles on the preservation of produced drinking water and methods for disinfection and mineral fortification at household level are limited which represents a significant research gap therefore the present study aims to investigate the feasibility of a irwhu in producing drinking water at the household level meanwhile preservation and methods for disinfection and mineral fortification are also presented for the proposed system the primary objectives of this study are to i examine the technical viability of a irwhu that can produce drinking water for a household ii examine the water quality produced from the developed irwhu and check the compliance to the australian drinking water guidelines adwgs iii identify appropriate methods for preservation disinfection and additional mineral fortification and iv evaluate the economic feasibility of the proposed system 2 materials and methods 2 1 site location and description of the irwhu the irwhu was constructed on the werrington south campus of western sydney university wsu in new south wales australia 33 46 13 5 s 150 44 32 2 e the site is close to the regional area of western sydney and people living approximately 20 km away from the selected site are drinking rainwater without treatment the developed irwhu is shown in fig 1 left the irwhu consists of guttering and downpipe systems to collect and convey rainwater from the roof catchment to a first flush device in connection with the installed rainwater tank in this study a plastic tank with a volume of 2 kl is used for the collection and primary storage of harvested rainwater the tank size is selected based on a water balance model reported by the authors earlier 4 the tank is supported using recycled steel posts in the form of a truss structure it should be noted that the support can also be made using other locally available materials such as brick bamboo or timber the lifted tank allows the use of gravity as the driving force for the water to flow from the tank to the filter system which helped to avoid the installation of a water pump and the use of electricity to run the pump the dimensions of the installed rainwater tank can be seen in fig 1 right the tank material is food grade which is a requirement from the australian government all the plumbing materials and accessories with a possibility of contact with rainwater are also made of food grade materials a first flush device and two separate screens are also installed to divert the initial uncleaned water from the roof and obstruct large contaminants such as leaves and insects entering into the rainwater tank respectively 2 2 rainfall monitoring local rainfall pattern is one of important parameters in developing the water balance model in this study local rainfall pattern has been recorded by installing a rain gauge on the site as shown in fig 2 a fig 2b shows the information receiver which can read store and show the data on the monitor the installed piezometer is shown in fig 2c which is used to determine the level of water in the tank 2 3 design and construction of gravity fed water filtration unit the schematic of the developed gravity fed filtration unit is shown in fig 3 left in which sand charcoal cheesecloth limestone and gravel are used as filtration materials to find out the best arrangement for the filtration materials a number of combinations were tested and the results have been reported elsewhere 1 according to the authors the filter chamber should be filled with gravel cheesecloth sand limestone charcoal and small gravel from the bottom to the top a photo of the configured filter is shown in fig 3 right the construction materials of the irwhu are selected based on a number of factors firstly all materials in contact with the harvested water should be food grade to avoid any potential health risks secondly the lining of the tank material must not include any animal derived compounds which might conflict with some social values of specific community such as vegan people lastly the filter materials including gravels charcoals limestone sand and cheesecloth steel mesh must be washed thoroughly before placing into the filter chamber it is recommended that the filter materials should be purchased from reliable suppliers to ensure good quality sand and gravels need to be soaked for 48 h before washing them thoroughly it is also recommended that an initial trial of 48 h should be maintained before the filter is used for practical application in the following the performance of the developed filter is evaluated in terms of water quality and quantity 2 4 sampling water samples were either collected from the rainwater tank directly referred to as before filtration or from the outlet of the filtration unit referred to as after filtration the samples were brought to the wsu s environmental lab and preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c before testing tap water was also tested for comparison purposes samples were collected weekly every time a total of nine samples were collected representing samples before filtration after filtration and from the nearby tap respectively the experiment was run for four consecutive months 2 5 analytical procedure a gallery automated photometric analyser thermo scientific is used to determine the concentrations of nitrate nitrites and ammonia the details of the testing procedure can be found elsewhere 18 the ph of the collected samples was determined using a hach hq40d portable multi meter a shimadzu total organic carbon analyser toc l csh csn is used to determine the total organic carbon toc the detection limit of the toc analyser is 4 μg l the testing parameters were selected based on the adwgs and the priority parameters tested regularly by the local water distribution company moreover samples were also sent to and tested by als global accredited by the national association of testing authorities nata all precautionary procedures were followed during the sample delivery to als global to make sure that the test conditions were not compromised 2 6 life cycle cost analysis a life cycle cost analysis lcca has been performed to determine the economic viability of the proposed irwhu system in the analysis all economic and financial flows at different times have been converted into present day values the lcca analysis is conducted based on nominal costs and the discount rate method and the details are given elsewhere 2 14 table 1 presents the actual costs of different items used in the construction of the practical irwhu system on wsu s werrington south campus in this study we have compared the lcca results between the actually constructed system and the designed system to understand the difference in economic feasibility analyses in different stages since some items might be overlooked in the design stage the comparison is useful to understand any hidden costs which should be incorporated in future lcca 2 7 design requirement there are two important parameters that should be examined to evaluate the technical feasibility of a household level drinking water production and supply system the first of these is that the system should be able to produce a sufficient amount of drinking water to fulfil the demand of a household throughout the year the second requirement is that the quality of the produced water should satisfy the national standards for drinking water therefore suitable storage and disinfection methods should be adopted to ensure the quality of the water for a required period we have investigated all these issues and the results are discussed in the following section 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quantity and quality fig 4 a shows the water production capacity of the developed irwhu system equipped with the filter unit described in section 2 3 the irwhu system run continuously for six hours and the hourly water production rate was evaluated accordingly as can be seen the water production rates are in the range of 14 2 16 8 l h based on the data the average filtration capacity of the developed irwhu system is calculated to be 14 5 l h or 348 l day with an uncertainty within 5 a long term monitoring was further conducted to check the water production capacity of the system within four months and the results are shown in fig 4 b during this measurement the irwhu system was left running continuously and the water production data were collected on the first day of the following month as we can see the water production rates in the four consecutive months are 16 8 15 65 16 and 14 85 l h respectively it seems that the collected rainwater in the storage tank is relatively clean which can be attributed to the installation of the first flush chamber and the filtration unit it should also be noted that there are not many tall trees around the roof which makes it a decent site for rainwater harvesting 29 the filter cartridge was not blocked even after the continuous filtration for four months however after four months the experiment had to be stopped because some sand particles were found in the filtered water after checking the filter unit it was found that the cheesecloth started to degrade allowing the sand particles to pass through it is therefore recommended that the cheesecloth should be replaced by food grade stainless steel mesh to ensure durability besides the presence of sand particles in the filtered water might be solved by layering finer sand on the top of coarser sand in the tube this will be adopted in future as a further development of the system this can also address the concern that the cheesecloth might promote microbial growth in the long run though the stored water in the rainwater tank is found to be relatively clear this is not the case for the first flush runoff in the beginning of the rainfall event a significant amount of dirt was found in the first flush chamber as can be seen in fig 5 after two rainfall events the two rainfall events are referred to as event 1 and event 2 respectively for event 1 the rain occurred after 46 dry days whilst event 2 occurred only after 6 dry days the accumulated amounts of dirt in the first flush chamber were found to be 9 3 and 3 8 g after events 1 and 2 respectively the study argues that a first flush chamber is necessary for the irwhu system the quality of the filtered water was studied first at the environmental lab of western sydney university and the test results are shown in table 2 tests were also conducted on tap water for comparison purposes the results of the produced water and tap water are also presented in table 2 as can be seen in table 2 ph of the rainwater after filtration and tap water comply with the adwgs however ph of the rainwater before filtration is lower than the recommended value in adwgs as expected 35 inclusion of limestone in the filter column has effectively increased the ph of the water electrical conductivity of the harvested rainwater both before and after filtration was much lower than the recommended level in adwgs this is because rainwater lacks minerals which are often found in groundwater 21 the issue of shortage of minerals in rainwater is addressed in section 3 3 ammonia nh3 concentration in the unfiltered rainwater is high which could be attributed to the presence of feces of birds rodents dead insects and or rotten leaves on the roof however the concentration level of nh3 reduced significantly after filtration other parameters such as no2 no3 total organic carbon toc and turbidity are within the adwg limits for all tested samples the filtered rainwater was further tested at one of australia s nata 1 1 national association of testing authorities accredited lab in sydney als global this is because nata accreditation is important for this research since the produced water would be used for human consumption the test results are shown in table 3 in which the parameters are those reported by sydney water the water supplying company in sydney australia regularly for drinking water the fourth column in table 3 presents the limits of different parameters specified by adwgs as we can see that all the parameters for the filtered rainwater comply with the adwgs except the iron content this is because of the rust that occurred on the surface of the corrugated steel roof and or the low ph of rainwater to dissolve iron moreover the results obtained from the wsu s environmental lab are in good agreement with the results from als global for ph dissolved oxygen and no2 no heavy metals are above the recommended limits in adwgs the colour hardness and turbidity of the filtered water comply with the guidelines which indicates that the filtering materials have been selected properly for treating rainwater a microbiological test for the filtered water was also conducted at als global as can be seen in table 3 the tested sample has a level of e coli less than 1 cfu 100 ml which is the standard set in adwgs it should be noted that the absence of e coli does not necessarily mean that the water would never be contaminated the quality of the filtered water has to be monitored regularly to detect potential contamination by pathogens with increasing storage time also if the water contains a high amount of toc total organic carbon the probability of microbial organism growth is high over time the best approach to tackle this issue is to disinfect the water before consumption there are several ways for doing this including chlorination and uv and ozone disinfection each of these disinfection methods has its own merits and demerits the chlorination method is highly effective and cost effective since they are readily available and have a residual effect while uv disinfection requires a special design to apply an appropriate dosage of uv light also pre filtration is required for effective uv light penetration moreover there is a power supply requirement for uv disinfection and no residual effect can be obtained by using this method in a rural area this can be a challenge as for ozone disinfection there is a concern that by products produced in this method are susceptible to carcinogens 4 considering the scale and installation site of the proposed irwhu chlorination seems to be the most suitable method to disinfect filtered rainwater 12 however the correct dosage of chlorine is crucial because a high dosage might affect human health in this study we have determined the safe limit of chlorine dosing in the rainwater 3 2 disinfection by chlorination and storage the concept of chlorination is to add chlorine into the water which would kill the germs and disinfect the water two types of chemicals are usually used for chlorination purpose i sodium hypochlorite solution naocl and ii solid calcium hypochlorite ca ocl 2 in this study naocl is used since it is cost effective and locally available and can be easily mixed with water a high dose of this chemical is harmful to human health therefore the breakpoint chlorination curve is drawn in fig 6 a using experimental data to select the appropriate dose that would be sufficient to kill the germs to run this experiment diluted chlorine 1 mg l 1 ppm is added to the filtered water in every 3 min and the residual chlorine mg l is determined using a hach dr1900 diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd colorimetric method spectrophotometer 26 in fig 6 a each data point represents the addition of 1 mg l diluted chlorine solution into the water at that moment the interval between two data points are three minutes as can be seen in fig 6 a residual chlorine could be detected once diluted chlorine solution was added into the filtered water at first dosing the residual chlorine was 0 7 0 035 mg l while after second dosing the level increased to 0 86 0 043 mg l it seemed that in the beginning the residual was lower than the dosing since a certain amount of chlorine was consumed in destroying the organic matters presented in the water according to adwgs the maximum acceptable limit of chlorine in drinking water is 5 mg l looking at the test results reported by sydney water it seems that the chlorination level of their water is always kept within 1 3 mg l to comply with the sydney water standard it is recommended that a dosing level of 3 mg l would keep the water safe for drinking however it should be noted that the recommendation can vary depending on the location of the irwhu system since the organic matters may vary place to place after the determination of the dosing level it is important to determine the detention time for chlorination in this study the detention time has been determined experimentally as shown in fig 6 b the first 10 min were crucial for the process where 21 67 of the dilute chlorine solution had been used to disinfect the water after 15 min of chlorination it seemed that the level of chlorine became almost stable however it is recommended that 30 min should be given for the chlorination 15 16 in our work an additional test has been conducted to investigate how the residual chlorine varies with time fig 6 c represents the degradation of residual chlorine over time in this test the filtered water was chlorinated in the beginning with an arbitrary amount of diluted chlorine solution 6 0 3 mg l after that the chlorinated water was stored in a water container and kept in a dark place at room temperature for several weeks this is to simulate the situation where the irwhu owner disinfects the produced drinking water and stores it in indoor environment for future use at 10 00 am of every tuesday a 10 ml sample was collected from the container and tested for residual chlorine the results are shown in fig 6 c as we can see the chlorine concentration reduced significantly over time after six weeks the chlorine level dropped from 6 0 3 to 0 52 0 26 mg l a total of 79 5 of the chlorine solution had been consumed in first three weeks the continuous reduction of the chlorine concentration could be attributed to the slow reaction between chlorine and other compounds in the water as suggested by clark and sivaganesan 10 therefore if one wants to store the filtered water for a long period of time an immediate chlorination after filtration is not recommended instead the chlorination might be done just one day prior to the consumption of the stored water from fig 6 c it can be argued that the chlorinated water may stay drinkable for at least a week according to the who chlorine should add at least 30 min of contact time with water to disinfect the filtered water 33 3 3 additional mineral fortification 3 3 1 sodium fortification one of the essential minerals in our regular diet is sodium the most common source of this mineral is from cooking salt which has no smell and can easily dissolve in water however the taste of the water becomes salty when the level of the salt is greater than 180 mg per litre usually the salt intake is related to the consumption of food instead of drinking water nonetheless adding cooking salt into rainwater may improve the overall mineral level according to the government of western australia sodium is essential for normal functioning of the human body and it is not generally considered harmful at normal levels of intake from combined food and drinking water sources 23 the addition of cooking salt into harvested rainwater and the corresponding changes in ph electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen is shown in fig 7 the sample is prepared by adding 90 mg of cooking salt into one litre of filtered rainwater as can be seen in fig 7 the addition of cooking salt into rainwater improved the electrical conductivity from 35 5 to 252 μs cm which is very close to the corresponding value of the sydney tap water 262 μs cm this could be attributed to the addition of free ions in water as a result of cooking salt addition the changes in ph and electrical conductivity due to cooking salt addition were 1 and 2 3 respectively which were insignificant 3 3 2 healthy dietary requirement the presence of dissolved minerals in the rainwater is quite low however there are a number of minerals such as calcium magnesium iron and fluoride that are crucial for health drinking of harvested rainwater in a regular basis would be a concern for a mineral deficient diet therefore a proper diet should be maintained to get all these essential nutrients coming from the food for example dairy products and fruits like orange blackberries strawberries and raspberries are good sources of calcium in addition green vegetables such as spinach kale broccoli avocado peas cabbage green beans artichokes asparagus and brussels sprouts are prominent sources for magnesium and calcium seafood like salmon mackerel and tuna are rich in magnesium fluoride which is one of the important nutrients that strengthen and re mineralise damaged enamel lacks in rainwater for small scale water production systems such as ours adding fluoride is not recommended because the treatment method is complex and inappropriate handling of fluoride might result in a substantial health hazard however foods like spinach grapes raisins blue crab black tea russet potatoes and prawns are good sources for fluoride 3 4 lcca of irwhu the economic benefit of the proposed irwhu system can be determined by lcca the results are compared with our previously reported findings from a feasibility study conducted at the beginning of this research 3 factors responsible for inconsistency in the results are identified and discussed the lcca results for the actual and modelled irwhus are presented and compared in fig 8 as we can see payback periods for the modelled and practical irwhus are one and eight years respectively considering the produced water with a price of au 7 0 l in both cases the significant shift in the payback period for the practical system is due to a number of hidden costs that were not foreseen during the modelling since the modelling was performed based on literature reports where these types of costs had been rarely reported it is argued that the knowledge of these costs from this study would help future researchers to model a system more precisely the major cost differences between a model and practical irwhus are shown in the inset of fig 8 as we can see construction of the foundation and plumbing and labour costs are almost three times and two times higher than what we have budgeted during modelling respectively the significant difference in foundation cost is because of a number of hidden costs such as excavation for the foundation hiring rubbish bin removal of the rubbish bin levelling formwork and temporary fencing at the work area for safety during modelling for the foundation the only cost for concrete was considered a considerable cost difference is also noticeable for plumbing and labour in modelling the length of plumbing and the time required for plumbing were considered however in practical installation additional costs related to the travelling of the plumber and new guttering system had to be included in the lcca therefore the water production cost from the practical irwhu was au 4 l while a production cost of au 1 07 l was reported for the irwhu model 3 further research is needed to optimise the foundation design to reduce the construction cost to increase the economic benefits of the proposed system 3 5 step by step guide for the installation of an irwhu the ultimate objective of this study is to examine the technical and economic feasibilities of household level irwhu in producing drinking water based on the analysis presented above it can be argued that the system is feasible and could be implemented practically however a practical implementation requires a set of guidelines that need to be followed in

13238,over the years industry agriculture and other human activities have discharged a large number of organic pollutants into the natural environment among these persistent organic pollutants pops mainly represented by polychlorinated biphenyls pcb and aldrin have attracted intense attention to achieve the safe discharge of wastewater a variety of treatment technologies have been used to effectively eliminate the pops in water this article reviews the currently most promising approach of electrochemical oxidation eo technology introduces its basic principles and describes the research progress and application status of electrode materials electrochemical reactors and electrocatalysts at the same time the effects of operating conditions such as current density and electrolyte type on the degradation effect are discussed finally the performance of the combination of eo technology and other water treatment technologies is summarized in these processes we discussed in detail the directions for improvement and potential mechanisms of eo technology and found that the choice of appropriate operating conditions can not only improve the processing efficiency but also reduces the processing cost for example for different pops different supporting electrolytes are selected and the ph value of the reaction is controlled however we should note that electrode optimization is always the core of eo technology improvement and the use of high efficiency electrocatalysts and the combination of combined processes are promising for the broader use of eo technology graphical

electrochemical oxidation eo anodes electrocatalyst combination electrochemical process 1 introduction the total amount of freshwater resources in the world is limited and many countries are currently facing multiple problems related to water resources with the shortage waste and pollution of water resources constituting the three most serious problems among these water pollution is the most critical current issues 1 compared to biological pollution such as red tides or physical pollution such as suspended solids the chemical pollution caused by organic compounds produced by industry agriculture medicine and human activities and discharged into water bodies is the most serious and has the most far reaching impact organochlorine pesticides including ddt aldrin chlordane polychlorinated biphenyls pcb polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes dioxins and perfluoroalkyl acids pfas are some examples of such pollutant organic compounds 2 3 in addition printing and dyeing wastewater and antibiotics that meet the persistence conditions can also be included in this category 4 5 these compounds have high resistance to biodegradation photolysis and biodegradation and can exist for a long time once they are discharged into the environment although most pops exist in trace amounts in the environment they can migrate through various media and reach extremely remote areas they can also accumulate in organisms reach toxic concentrations through the biological amplification of the food chain and ultimately affect human consumers 6 7 additionally their carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic effects can make them highly dangerous even at low concentrations 3 since the united nations environment program adopted the stockholm convention in 2001 global consensus has been achieved regarding the great harm of pops and the urgent need to eliminate them 4 in the past few decades researchers have adopted various technical means to eliminate pops in water for example dixit et al 8 used ion exchange to remove pfas in water alardhi et al 9 10 used mesoporous materials to adsorb dye pollutants in water and cuozzo et al 11 used streptomyces for the biodegradation of chlordane although these traditional physical biological and chemical treatment methods have different characteristics and advantages efficient removal of pops is still difficult as can be observed from the detection results of pops in water animals and plants worldwide 12 13 the unsatisfactory performance of the conventional treatment methods and the increasingly severe water pollution have motivated an increasing ongoing research effort for the development of new treatment methods in particular electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops such as plasma oxidation fenton oxidation ozonation and electrochemical oxidation eo technologies have emerged as the most promising methods for wastewater treatment 14 15 in these methods organic matter is degraded by directly exchanging electrons or generating radicals with strong oxidizing properties in particular the hydroxyl radicals oh in the eaops process electrochemical oxidation eo technology has distinct advantages 16 17 due to its lack of a need for complex equipment required for plasma oxidation technology and the lack of the secondary pollution that may be caused by fenton oxidation technology eo technology has excellent wastewater treatment performance characteristics such as i the treatment equipment is simple and requires little floor space ii the treatment process is clean the amount of discharge is low and essentially no secondary pollution is generated making eo an environmentally friendly technology iii the treatment cycle is short the operation is convenient and the controllability is excellent 18 iv the treatment conditions are mild enabling the application of this method to a variety of wastewater treatment situations its many practical advantages make eo a highly promising prospective technology for the treatment of wastewater containing pops 19 21 recent studies on the degradation of pops by eo technology in water are reviewed in this paper first the basic principle of eo technology is briefly discussed in order to better analyze and understand the key factors and characteristics of the process as shown in fig 1 22 the key influencing factors of electrochemical oxidation process include electrode materials electrochemical reactor anode cathode distance current density electrolyte type and concentration solution ph and initial pollutant concentration among these key factors the electrode materials and electrochemical reactor are the main focus of this review and the anode cathode distance current density electrolyte type and concentration solution ph and initial pollutant concentration are discussed as operating parameters for obtaining optimal performance in addition the principle preparation and performance characteristics of the electrocatalysts are introduced finally the combination of eo technology and other water treatment processes is emphasized because the development of integrated technology is a key step for the transfer of eo technology from the laboratory to industrial application 2 fundamentals eo applies the basic electrolysis mechanism in the treatment process direct current is applied to the wastewater fig 2 in order to oxidize and reduce the pops in the wastewater at the anode and cathode poles respectively through the electrolysis process 23 24 converting them to easily biodegradable low molecular weight substances with low toxicity that can then be easily treated with biological treatments in some cases complete mineralization of organic matter can be achieved by the electrolysis so that the pops are completely converted into harmless substances such as co2 and h2o to achieve wastewater purification 25 26 the pops in wastewater are mainly degraded by anodic oxidation that can be divided into direct oxidation and indirect oxidation 28 29 no evident degradation is found at the cathode but organic matter can be dechlorinated at the cathode dechlorination can reduce the toxicity of wastewater which is beneficial for the subsequent biological treatment process 2 1 direct oxidation as shown in fig 3 a direct oxidation means that after organic pollutants are adsorbed on the surface of the anode they undergo direct charge transfer from the electrode therefore the organic pollutants are oxidized the molecular chains are broken and the molecular weight drops rapidly this process can be expressed as 1 r p e where r and p represent the high molecular organic pollutants and oxidized matter respectively the direct oxidation at the anode has two characteristics i the occurrence of direct oxidation of the organic pollutants at the anode requires a diffusion process that is the organic pollutants are adsorbed from the electrolyte solution to the anode surface and this process limits the oxidation rate 30 ii the direct oxidation rate mainly depends on the electrocatalytic activity of the anode material and the applied current intensity and is not affected by other oxidizing substances however in the direct oxidation process the direct interaction between electrons and organic matter mainly occurs at the anode potential that is lower than the oxygen evolution reaction oer potential 29 and the relatively low oxidation potential leads to the lower oxidation ability of the anode for direct oxidation compared to indirect oxidation direct oxidation shows low oxidation efficiency 31 2 2 indirect oxidation indirect oxidation refers to the following process under the action of an external current through an anodic oxidation reaction intermediate products with strong oxidation effect are produced on the electrode surface or the interface of the solution environment 32 such as hydroxyl radicals oh ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and other oxidizing particles eqs 2 and 3 33 if so4 2 cl and po4 3 are present in the wastewater oxidizing particles such as s2o8 2 cl2 hclo and p2o8 4 may also be produced eqs 4 and 5 34 35 these oxidizing particles react with organic pollutants through processes such as electron transfer double bond addition ring opening and group removal to achieve efficient degradation of organic pollutants 36 37 the initial oxidation reaction occurs on the electrode surface and subsequent degradation of the pollutants occurs in the electrolyte solution phase so that indirect oxidation can be subdivided into electrode surface indirect oxidation and electrolyte solution phase indirect oxidation 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 3 3 h 2 o o 3 6 h 6 e 4 2 hso 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 e 5 2 po 4 3 p 2 o 8 4 2 e 2 2 1 electrode surface indirect oxidation among the active oxygen species produced by the electrode reaction oh is the main oxidizing species because it is produced in large amounts and has a high oxidation potential 2 8 v while its oxidizing power is second only to fluorine oh has a very short life 10 9 s that makes it difficult for it to diffuse in the electrolyte solution so that its oxidation reaction occurs mainly on the electrode surface 30 oh is mainly produced by electrolysis of water at the anode m as described by eq 6 6 m h 2 o m oh h e after oh is produced it will be adsorbed on the anode surface based on the electrode properties active electrodes and inactive electrodes 38 39 the adsorption is also divided into the categories of chemical adsorption and physical adsorption these two adsorption states correspond to two different oxidation mechanisms 40 41 as is shown in the schematic diagrams presented in fig 3b and c a classification of the most common anodes for eo and their basic properties can be found in table 1 for active electrodes 42 such as graphite platinum pt iridium dioxide iro2 and ruthenium dioxide ruo2 oh is chemically adsorbed on the electrode surface that is the oh produced by the electrolysis of water will react with the active anode and the anode will bond to the oxygen in oh to form a chemically adsorbed mo in the anode lattice the reaction can be described as follows 7 m oh mo h e for inactive electrodes such as boron doped diamond 43 and lead dioxide electrode pbo2 oh is physically adsorbed on the electrode surface without the formation of chemical bonds when mo is formed on the surface of the active electrode the oxidation activity of oh will be weakened the lower oxidation performance makes it difficult to completely mineralize organic pollutants and leads to only a partial oxidation of organic pollutants into biodegradable intermediate products including compounds such as short chain carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones 32 45 while the oh on the surface of the inactive electrode still has strong oxidation activity and can completely mineralize some pops and directly convert them into co2 and h2o 2 2 2 indirect oxidation of the electrolyte solution phase although oxidizing particles such as h2s2o8 cl2 hclo and clo are not as oxidizing as oh their long lifetime in solution enables them to oxidize organic pollutants on the electrode surface and at the same time diffuse into the electrolyte solution and react with organic pollutants 46 47 as shown in fig 4 a and b different active substances are produced by the reaction described by eqs 8 12 8 m oh cl m hclo 9 m hclo 1 2 cl 2 oh 10 2 cl cl 2 aq 2 e 11 cl 2 aq h 2 o hclo cl h 12 hclo h cl o although the long lifetime enables h2s2o8 cl2 hclo clo and other oxidizing particles to fully react with the organic pollutants in the electrolyte solution their reactivity is weaker than that of oh so that they cannot mineralize organic pollutants but rather only convert them into intermediate products with lower toxicity the presence of a large amount of cl in wastewater not only produces cl2 hclo clo and other chlorine active substances in the solution but also can produce some highly toxic organic chlorine by products such as chlorate and perchlorate 48 therefore radjenovic et al 49 believe that a critical chlorine concentration in wastewater exists that is beneficial for the removal of pollutants but still produces a low and acceptable amount of highly toxic by products 3 electrodes in eo technology the electrode is the most important component and the material and performance of the electrode directly determine the cost and efficiency of the oxidation process the oxidation reaction in the eo process mainly occurs at the anode and the catalytic activity and stability of the anode are the key factors that determine its oxidation capacity and working life therefore most researchers have focused on the preparation of anode materials with high performance low cost and suitability for practical applications through selection of suitable materials design of favorable structures and improvement of the preparation process as shown in fig 5 research on eo anodes has focused first on graphite and pure metal electrodes then the dimensionally stable anode dsa boron doped diamond bdd electrodes and sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode were introduced and have been investigated in many recent studies 3 1 graphite and pure metal electrodes in the early stage of research on wastewater treatment by eo graphite electrodes and pure metal electrodes were mainly used 53 both graphite and pure metal materials have the advantages of excellent electrical properties low cost and easy preparation of electrodes and therefore are widely used in wastewater treatment for example yong et al 54 used exfoliated graphite eg as the oxidation anode to electrochemically degrade methyl orange mo in artificial textile wastewater under the operating conditions of current density of 13 ma cm 2 ph 2 0 and electrolyte concentration of 0 1 mol dm 3 and electrolysis for 20 min the removal rate of pigment in wastewater reaches 98 0 and an excellent removal effect is obtained sivodia et al 55 investigated the removal of the environmentally persistent cytarabine cbn anticancer drug and used graphite electrodes as the oxidation anodes to degrade cbn the results show that the entire eo process is dominated by indirect oxidation with cl2 and hclo as the main oxidants a kinetic study was performed to determine the changes of the reaction rate during electrolysis it was found that the kinetic rate constant varied between 0 15 and 0 07 min 1 at ph 3 7 respectively indicating that lower ph values are beneficial to cbn degradation under the reaction conditions of the current density of 10 ma cm 2 and ph of 3 the removal rate of cbn reached 95 after 60 min of electrolysis the metal electrodes used in eo technology include al fe ti and platinum group metals when al and fe are used as anodes they can not only degrade organic pollutants through oxidation but also form colloidal particles in the electrolyte solution fig 6 relying on electric flocculation to separate the colloidal impurities in the wastewater by coagulation precipitation or air floatation for example kumari et al 56 studied the treatment of acetaminophen and natural organic matter in river water with aluminum as the anode and found that the best treatment conditions are reaction time of 60 min inter electrode distance of 2 cm and voltage of 9 v the removal effects of aluminum as the anode and iron as the anode were compared and it was found that the aluminum anode is more effective than the iron anode based on the post treatment x ray diffraction analysis they explained that the main mechanism of the degradation process is based on the formation of hydrogen bonds between acetaminophen and aluminum hydroxide 3 2 metal oxide electrodes metal oxide electrodes have good stability and high catalytic activity are often used as anode materials and are known as dimensionally stable anode dsa the industrial application of dsa has a history of more than 30 years 58 it is mainly used in environmental pollution control 59 fuel cells and chemical raw material preparation 60 in particular 90 of the electrodes used in production in chlor alkali industry are dsa electrodes the dsa used in the early days consisted only of metal oxides such as pbo2 sno2 iro2 and ruo2 compared to graphite electrodes and pure metal electrodes the conductivity and corrosion resistance of these oxide electrodes is improved but their mechanical strength and erosion resistance are poor to obtain higher application value researchers have continued to optimize the dsa and developed a new generation of dsa composed of a substrate and a metal oxide film various materials such as ceramics pt ti and fe have been explored for use as substrates among which titanium based are the most widely used when titanium is used as an anode directly it spontaneously forms a protective oxide film on the electrode causing the surface resistance to be too high however a large number of studies have found that the titanium matrix can form a contact interface with some metals and conductive oxides with low resistance since then ti based substrates have become popular metal substrates for research and applications due to their good stability and conductivity and a variety of ti based dsas have been developed see fig 7 51 61 ken et al 53 used ti ruo2 as the oxidation anode and used stable temperature resistant and durable graphite as the cathode to construct an eo device for the degradation of coke oven wastewater and determined the optimal electrolysis parameters the experimental results show that under the conditions of the initial ph of 8 0 electrolyte nacl concentration of 1 6 g l 1 and current density of 24 ma cm 2 90 of organic pollutants were eliminated within 180 min the morphological study fesem edx proved that after multiple cycles of treatment there is no significant physical change on the anode surface and the electrode has good stability jiang et al 62 used thermal sintering to form an iro2 coating on the ti substrate and successfully prepared a ti iro2 electrode that was then used to pretreat tnt red water to improve its biodegradability to better investigate the electrochemical treatment mechanism of tnt red water zero order pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic equations were used to fit the cod removal rates obtained under different conditions the results show that in the process of electrochemical degradation of organic pollutants in tnt red water the removal of cod follows the pseudo secondary model subsequent electrochemical analysis showed that the ti iro2 electrode had a strong oxidation effect on organic pollutants in tnt red water after electrolysis for 30 h all no2 functional groups in tnt red water were degraded in depth studies of dsa electrodes have found that the doping of metal and non metal elements can further improve the performance of dsa this is because the doping of elements will form surface defects such as crystal plane steps and dislocations in the electrode coating these defects in the electrode can increase the number of electron transfer channels and improve the conductivity and catalytic activity of the electrode accelerating the electrochemical reaction process on the electrode surface and improving the current efficiency at the same time the overpotential for the oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution carried out at the modified electrode will increase 68 69 the doping of elements can also avoid the formation of a polymer film on the surface of the electrode that hinders electron transfer and ensures that the electrode will maintain high catalytic oxidation activity under long term operation 70 71 wang et al 72 used different amounts of rare earth yb element to dope ti sno2 ruo2 electrodes and found that 1 5 yb doping increases the oxygen evolution potential and electrocatalytic oxidation activity of the electrode kinetic analysis showed that the degradation process of toc in coking wastewater is consistent with the first order kinetic equation when the current density is 10 ma cm 2 the reaction rate constant is the largest 0 1834 min 1 and therefore this current density was identified as the optimal current condition under this condition the cod removal rate of coking wastewater reached 85 06 after electrolysis for 30 min in other studies liu et al 73 used a sol gel route to synthesize ruo2 doped iro2 zro2 ternary oxide coatings with different ru ir zr molar ratios to study the effect of the different amounts of ru doping of ti iro2 zro2 electrodes analysis of the electrode surface morphology and electrochemical behavior found that with the increasing ru content the porosity and cracking of the ternary oxide coating were significantly increased improving the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode but reducing its stability the experimental results showed that a compact coating structure with good electrocatalytic activity and the longest service life are obtained for the ru content of 21 mol in the application of the ti based coating electrode due to the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and metal oxide coating a mismatch at the interface will arise due to the heating during electrochemical degradation that may lead to the fracture and spalling of the coating and finally electrode deactivation to solve this problem an intermediate coating was added to improve the stability and working life of the electrode duan et al 74 prepared a novel composite electrode gns pbo2 based on ti pbo2 by composite electrodeposition as shown in fig 8 ti acts as the substrate for the electrode on which a sno2 sb2o3 layer an α pbo2 layer a β pbo2 inner layer a gns layer and a β pbo2 outer layer are sequentially deposited duan et al used 2 chlorophenol as the target to determine the electrochemical performance and stability of gns pbo2 and ti pbo2 electrodes compared to the traditional pbo2 electrodes gns pbo2 not only shows a larger electrochemical active surface area and stronger oh generation ability but also has almost twice longer service life 107 9 h compared to 55 9 h for the traditional pbo2 electrode and shows a significantly higher electrochemical degradation rate constant after many runs no significant decrease in the activity of the gns pbo2 electrode was observed indicating that the electrode has excellent stability and reusability during the electrochemical oxidation process in another study li et al 75 used the impregnation method to prepare ti fto sno2 sb electrodes to study the influence of the fto interlayer on the electrode structure and life the results show that with the introduction of the fto intermediate layer the electrode surface becomes smoother and the crystallite size decreased effectively improving the crack phenomenon on the electrode surface during the anodic oxidation process the fto intermediate layer greatly delays the formation of the titanium dioxide insulating layer and improves the electrode life in addition considering the good distribution properties of nanomaterials and in particular the high specific surface area and the tip effect of nanostructures that also maintain excellent physical and electrochemical properties the application of nanotechnology in the field of electrode fabrication has attracted increased research attention for example zhang et al 76 successfully prepared nano ti zno electrodes by loading nano zno particles on a ti sheet for electrochemical oxidation of perfluorinated compounds pfc in wastewater under the conditions of a current density of 50 ma cm 2 and an electrode plate distance of 0 5 cm the degradation efficiency of pfcs reached 65 84 after reaction for 40 min this value is much higher than that of ordinary anodes indicating that nano zno plays an important role in the electrochemical process chianeh et al 77 also successfully coated sno2 nanoparticles on the surface of ti substrate by electrophoretic deposition technology to prepare nano sno2 ti electrode sem images show that the sno2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the surface of the ti substrate and these stacked nanoparticles greatly increase the porosity and specific surface area of the electrode using this electrode to treat azo dyes the experimental results show that under the best conditions 93 2 of the decolorization rate can be obtained in 16 min in addition for the ti pbo2 electrode the coating of β pbo2 could be easily exfoliated from the substrate resulting in the leakage of the toxic pb element to solve this problem man et al 78 chose to modify the pbo2 electrode by doping sic nanoparticles a series of characterization results showed that the nano sic was successfully doped in the catalytic coating of β pbo2 grains subsequently toluene diamine tda was degraded by eo technology using the ti sic pbo2 electrode and electrolyzed for 2 h under a current density of 50 ma cm 2 when the initial tda concentration was 0 05 g l 1 and 0 10 g l 1 tda can be completely removed and the cod removal rates of the solution were 95 22 and 81 48 respectively the cod removal process in all concentrations followed the pseudo first order kinetics model and the rate constants kcod of the mineralization process were 1 0229 h 1 and 0 5063 h 1 respectively this process showed that the absolute tda removal amount increases and the decomposition process was more effective when the initial tda concentration was higher the subsequent accelerated life test of the electrode showed that the accelerated life of the electrode was 61 8 h approximately 3 times longer than that of the traditional pbo2 electrode demonstrating that the ti sic pbo2 electrode had higher stability and reusability these results showed that nano material doping is an effective approach for improving electrode performance dsa electrode has always been active in the field of electrochemical oxidation of wastewater the lower production cost and better electrochemical performance have made it favored by many researchers table 2 shows some research examples of dsa electrodes in various types of wastewaters in recent years the researchers improved the dsa electrode from the aspects of element composition and preparation process and selected the best operating conditions to improve the wastewater treatment capacity of the technology fully demonstrating that dsa electrode is an electrodes material with excellent electrical performance that is highly promising for use in wastewater treatment 3 3 boron doped diamond bdd electrodes diamond is a well known allotrope of carbon and shows excellent thermal conductivity good heat dissipation extremely high hardness and stable chemical properties its multiple advantageous characteristics make it a popular and widely used material however the breakdown voltage of diamond can reach 3 58 106 v cm 1 its band gap exceeds 5 ev and its conductivity is extremely low hindering its application to electrode materials in the late 1990s researchers doped boron into diamond and obtained a new material with excellent electrical conductivity without changing its other characteristics this enabled the fabrication of the novel boron doped diamond bdd electrode successful modifications endow bdd have many following excellent properties 86 87 i bdd electrodes have high mechanical strength corrosion resistance and stable chemical properties that lead to their long service life and high stability ii they have a high oxygen evolution overpotential and a wide potential window that reduces the oxygen evolution side reaction during the oxidation process at the electrode can generate a large number of strong oxidizing free radicals and have a stronger oxidation ability iii they have a low background current and low energy consumption iv the electrode surface is inert and has low adsorption capacity endowing the electrode with self cleaning ability that can effectively prevent electrode contamination in a recent study liu et al 88 revealed the water oxidation and radical oh production mechanism using spin polarized density functional theory dft calculations carried out using the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp code the calculation results show that the gibbs free energy of m oh 2 82 ev on the bdd anode is much higher than that of the oh radical 2 4 ev making the production of oh radical on bdd anode more thermodynamically favorable compared to o2 evolution this result is consistent with the conclusion of devadas et al 89 and both studies indicate that the bdd electrode has a high oxygen evolution overpotential and can produce a large amount of oh the excellent performance of the bdd electrode makes its use a highly promising approach for the electrochemical oxidation treatment of wastewater in other studies ukundimana et al 90 compared the treatment effects of the dbb electrode and four dsa electrodes ti pto2 iro2 ti ruo2 tio2 ti ruo2 iro2 and ti iro2 ta2o5 on ultrafiltration uf effluent from a landfill leachate treatment plant it was found that the performance of the bdd anode under the test conditions is superior to that of the other dsa anodes and the removal rates of toc and cod were 64 9 86 8 and 68 2 92 0 respectively in another study zazou et al 91 compared the oxidation efficiency and mineralization ability of pt dsa ti pto2 iro2 and bdd electrodes for 1 2 dichlorobenzene three electrodes of the same size 4 6 0 2 cm were used as the anode and carbon felt electrodes were used as the cathode under the same operating conditions the reaction was carried out for 180 min the experimental results show that the mineralization efficiency of dsa is poor and is only 35 but the toc removal rates of the pt and bdd electrodes are 80 and 90 respectively this can be explained by the high conductivity of pt and the high oxygen evolution potential of bdd in particular the bdd electrode has the characteristics of strong oxidation ability and low energy consumption convincingly demonstrating its potential as an oxidation anode due to the excellent properties of nanomaterials and nanostructures the preparation of bdd electrodes with various nanostructures has become a research hotspot in recent years for example shi et al 92 etched bdd film on titanium plate by chemical vapor deposition to prepare a bdd electrode with the nano cone array structure see fig 9 a and b compared to the untreated electrode the surface area of the nanostructured electrode increased by 31 the electrochemical oxidation of phenol with the array bdd ti electrode was carried out at the current density of 100 ma cm 2 for 240 min a cod removal efficiency of 63 30 was obtained that was 24 3 higher than that of the untreated electrode showing excellent electrochemical performance mei et al 93 prepared a 3d macroporous bdd electrode with adjustable pore size and interconnection channel see fig 9c and d that was used to oxidize and degrade an active anthraquinone dye rb 19 the 3d porous structure reduces the electron transfer resistance of the bdd ti electrode so that the electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxidation performance in the rb 19 treatment with 100 decolorization and 84 46 mineralization rate achieved in 90 min in addition li et al 94 also used chemical vapor deposition to grow a diamond film on a ta substrate and prepared a bdd electrode with a nano porous structure after etching see fig 9e and f characterization of the electrode showed that the nanostructure increases the effective electroactive surface area of the porous bdd ta electrode and reduces the charge transfer resistance at the liquid solid interface compared to the bdd ta electrode then the porous bdd ta electrode 20 10 0 12 mm was used as the oxidation anode and pt of the same size was used as the cathode to degrade methylene blue mb in combination with the electro fenton process the results show that under the optimum operating conditions the mb in the solution can be degraded by 97 after 80 min treatment indicating that nanostructuring can improve the electrocatalytic performance of bdd in recent years bdd electrodes have been used by researchers to mineralize various types of pops table 3 it can be seen from tabke 3 that bdd anode shows excellent degradation ability for organic pollutants that are difficult to purify by conventional treatment technologies particularly for pops that are difficult to degrade by microorganisms such as antibiotics pesticide residues and environmentally persistent drugs among the existing electrodes currently used in eo the bdd electrode has the highest oxygen evolution overpotential table 4 and has been extensively studied in academic research nb w ta si and other materials are commonly used substrates for bdd electrodes the physical and chemical properties of si are similar to those of diamond so that si substrate bdd electrodes are stable reliable and have long electrode service life however the mechanical strength of the si substrate is poor and it is difficult to prepare a large area electrode in addition according to the research of da silva et al 104 the use of nb as a substrate can reduce energy consumption when compared to the si substrate however these metal substrates are expensive and costly to use many factors hinder the use of bdd electrodes in large scale engineering applications for example the manufacturing process of synthetic diamond based on cvd is still limited to small scale production 49 therefore exploration of cost effective preparation methods and process design of bdd electrodes is still a research hotspot in this field 3 4 sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode magnéli phase sub stoichiometric titanium oxide general formula tino2n 1 was first produced by magnéli in 1959 107 while sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode is a new type of ceramic electrode composed of magnéli phase sub stoichiometric titanium oxide among the tino2n 1 materials ti4o7 and ti5o9 show the best performance and therefore account for a higher proportion in the sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode the sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode with the ti4o7 main component was also registered as the ebonex trademark in the 1990s 52 the magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode has a wide potential window high oxygen evolution overpotential strong corrosion resistance and conductivity of up to 1500 s cm 1 its many advantages and long service life have led to its rapid application to fuel cells lead acid batteries and other fields in recent years researchers have continuously modified and optimized it to explore the application prospects of this electrode for wastewater treatment 108 110 ganiyu et al 111 prepared a magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode by plasma deposition and compared its effectiveness for the degradation of the beta blocker propranolol ppn to the control dsa anode the research results show that under the same conditions compared to the total organic carbon removal rate of the dsa electrode 89 the total organic carbon removal rate of the magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode to ppn was improved and reached 96 corresponding to almost complete mineralization to further prove the potential of the magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode as an oxidation anode they 112 also set up dsa and bdd anodes treated paracetamol pcm with three electrodes under the same conditions and used three supporting electrolytes na2so4 nacl nano3 and naclo4 in the comparative experiments the dsa electrode showed the best removal efficiency in cl medium that was attributed to the fact that dsa anode has been proven to be an effective electrode for the production of active chlorine species 113 however the ti4o7 and bdd anodes showed higher degradation efficiency in so4 2 and clo4 media this can be explained by the high oxygen evolution overpotential of ti4o7 and bdd electrodes that causes them to produce a large amount of physically adsorbed ti4o7 oh and bdd oh the experimental results prove that compared to the dsa electrode and expensive bdd electrode the magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode shows better oxidation ability for pcm degradation in addition wang et al 114 prepared a magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode by high temperature sintering to simultaneously remove antibiotics pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes args in wastewater their study found that at a current density of 10 0 ma cm 2 a variety of pathogens were rapidly inactivated within 15 min and the removal rate of drug resistant genes in wastewater was also in the range of 99 65 99 94 after 3 h of treatment the removal rate of various antibiotics in the wastewater reached more than 90 these studies have provided the initial demonstration of the potential of sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrodes for use as oxidation anodes to further improve the electrochemical performance of the sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode a variety of methods was used for electrode optimization for example han et al 115 used plasma spraying to prepare an aluminum based oxide anode with ruo2 tio2 sno2 coating and ti4o7 intermediate layer it was found that the aluminum substrate and the ti4o7 intermediate layer are well combined to reduce the resistance of the electrode the doped coating on the surface leads to a highly uniform potential distribution on the electrode surface and improves the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode additionally in this process energy consumption is decreased and the cost of electrolysis is reduced compared to that using the ti ruo2 tio2 electrode lin et al 116 used high temperature sintering to prepare a magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode with extensive interconnecting macropores and used it for the electrochemical oxidation treatment of the environmentally persistent poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass their results show that the porous structure provides a large number of active sites for the oxidation of the substances on the electrode surface greatly improving the efficiency of electrochemical oxidation only trace amounts of perfluorocarboxylic acid pfcas with shortened chain lengths were observed as intermediates during pfoa mineralization after the treatment was completed no organofluorine compounds such as shorter chain pfcas were detected in the solution by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms it is believed that the electrode material will be used for the removal of fluorine containing substances in wastewater wang et al 117 prepared three types of magnéli phase anodes ti ti4o7 ti ti4o7 pbo2 ce ti ti4o7 nanotube arrays nta and through further characterization of the three electrodes found that all three anodes have very high oxygen evolution potentials 2 16 2 44 v vs sce their research showed that in the degradation of organic matter the highly ordered tubular structure of ti ti4o7 nta gives it the largest surface area that is conducive to the adsorption of organic matter endowing this electrode with the strongest degradation ability the ti ti4o7 pbo2 ce electrode showed the smallest surface area and therefore ti ti4o7 and ti ti4o7 nta displayed better performance than ti ti4o7 pbo2 ce with the phosphorus removal rate reaching 89 92 this removal rate is slightly lower than that of the bdd electrode 95 but the degradation ability of these three electrodes is still stronger than those of other electrodes such as ti pt and ti ruo2 iro2 thus sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrodes are considered to be highly promising and cost effective electrode materials for wastewater treatment with optimized ti ti4o7 and ti ti4o7 nta showing particularly promising performance 4 electrochemical reactor eo technology research has long been focused on the optimization of electrode materials and structures however in the electrochemical system the design and manufacture of highly efficient and reasonable electrochemical reactors is also an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of electrochemical oxidation reducing the cost of electrochemical treatment and improving the feasibility of the practical sue of electrochemical devices 4 1 two dimensional electrochemical reactor in the design and manufacturing of traditional two dimensional electrochemical reactors the main consideration is to further improve the efficiency of electrochemical treatment by improving mass transfer conditions in the related research work basha et al 118 used the ti ruox tiox electrode as the oxidation anode and stainless steel plate as the cathode for the eo treatment of special chemical industrial wastewaters containing number of refractory organic pollutants and intense chroma they did not conduct a detailed study of the electrode or the operating conditions but rather focused on the structure of the reactor and compared the performance of batch batch recirculation and continuous recycle reactors in the electrochemical oxidation of wastewater it was found that continuous recycle reactors can control the transfer coefficient and processing time through the circulation flow rate and the extraction flow rate the operation of these reactors is convenient and the circulation process also greatly improves the mass transfer efficiency therefore continuous recycle reactor is considered to be the best reactor structure in another study basha et al 119 used tiox ruox anodes under different operating conditions to compare the performance of the three reactors in the treatment of textile dye wastewater from the perspective of power consumption the experimental results showed that under the same treatment time the batch recirculation reactor has the best treatment effect and its energy consumption is relatively low after 6 h of operation flow rate of 100 l h 1 current density of 5 0 a dm 2 the rate of the removal of the cod in wastewater was 91 38 and the specific energy consumption was 83 8 kwh kg cod 1 generally the use of a circulation system greatly improves the mass transfer efficiency and processing efficiency 4 2 three dimensional electrochemical reactor two dimensional electrode reactors have shortcomings such as small specific surface area and low current efficiency to address these problems bickhurst et al 120 proposed the concept of three dimensional electrodes in the 1960s that are constructed by filling the traditional two dimensional electrodes with granular or detrital granular materials such as activated carbon and metal particles 121 under the action of an external electric field many micro electrochemical systems and electrochemical reactions will occur on the surface of the filler particles fig 10 that act as the third pole also known as the particle electrode 122 the filling of particle electrodes optimizes the mass transfer efficiency of the pollutants between the electrodes increases the specific surface area and effectively improves the current efficiency endowing this electrode with great application potential in the field of wastewater treatment 123 to date this approach has been used in the treatment of landfill leachate 124 pharmaceutical wastewater 125 126 dye wastewater 127 heavy metal ions 128 phenols 129 amines 130 and other wastewater and various pops in another study zhang et al 131 used ti sn ce bamboo biochar as a filler to prepare a three dimensional electrode and investigated the electrode s ability to treat coking wastewater the results showed that under the conditions of the electrolysis time of 150 min and current density of 30 ma m 2 the removal rates of chemical oxygen and organic carbon in coking wastewater reached 92 91 and 74 66 respectively in this study the addition of ti sn ce significantly improved the electro oxidation electro adsorption and electro catalysis performance of the carbon particle electrode effectively converting macromolecular toxic substances into low toxicity organic substances and improving the biochemical treatment of wastewater sun et al 132 prepared a ti sn sb γ al2o3 particle electrode to oxidatively degrade oxytetracycline otc during the electrochemical oxidation process large amounts of tio2 sno2 and sb2o3 were formed on the surface of the particle electrode these oxides are dispersed in the gap and surface of the particle electrode as spherical and rod shaped crystals significantly improving the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode under the optimal operating conditions the otc and toc removal rates reached 91 9 and 41 4 respectively chi et al 133 synthesized bentonite lignin nano zero valent iron bl nzvi with organic solvent lignin as the stabilizer bl nzvi was applied as a particle electrode and formed a three dimensional electrode system with ruthenium iridium coated titanium plates to treat pops such as tannin resin acid and chlorinated organic matter in papermaking wastewater experimental results showed that organic solvent lignin can effectively prevent the aggregation of zero valent iron nanoparticles under the best operating conditions the three dimensional electrode system has excellent performance in cod degradation and decolorization demonstrating that the three dimensional electrode is a highly promising technology in the field of wastewater treatment 5 electrocatalyst the modification of electrode materials and the optimization of electrochemical reactors are the main research directions of eo technology in addition to these two improvement methods some researchers used the method of adding electrocatalysts to the solution to obtained improved eo performance 5 1 basic mechanism fenton oxidation is a highly effective advanced oxidation process for the removal of pops from water it uses the reaction between h2o2 and a fenton reagent i e fe2 cu mn2 and other sub metallic salts to catalyze the formation of oh and then oxidize various organic substances into inorganic substances in the classic fenton reaction eq 13 hydrogen peroxide was catalytically decomposed by ferrous ion under acidic condition normally ph 3 to generate hydroxyl radicals oh 137 13 h 2 o 2 fe 2 fe 3 oh oh the fenton process has the advantages of high treatment efficiency and simple operation but also has significant disadvantages such as high h2o2 consumption difficult regeneration after low charge ions are transformed into high charge ions and secondary pollution caused by metal sludge 138 139 in a broad sense in addition to fenton process other processes that produce oh through h2o2 for treatment of organic matter can be collectively referred to as fenton like process 140 141 following this approach by adding metal salts such as h2o2 and fe2 fe3 to the electrolytic cell fe3 can be continuously converted to fe2 through cathode reduction eq 14 that is to realize the mn m n 1 redox cycle if bimetallic particles are loaded one metal redox cycle can also be excited by the other 14 fe 3 e fe 2 in addition the advanced oxidation process based on sulfate radical so4 has attracted increasing attention so4 has a high standard redox potential e 2 6 v she 142 similar to classic fenton s reaction sulfate radicals can be generated by activating peroxymonosulfate pms or oxone hso5 or peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 with transition metals eqs 15 and 16 and the process is also accompanied by the production of oh and superoxide radicals o2 143 15 s 2 o 8 2 m n m n 1 so 4 2 so 4 16 hs o 5 m n m n 1 oh so 4 through this method the combination of a fenton like process and eo process can strengthen the indirect oxidation capacity of the eo process so as to improve the treatment efficiency of pops in water because the supported catalyst can be easily separated from the product after the recovery of the catalyst by filtration and centrifugation the loss of catalytic activity is small and the separation amount of the load is small therefore in the eo fenton like process to prevent the generation of metal sludge natural zeolite alumina mesoporous molecular sieve and other substrates can be used to load metal particles or metal oxides to prepare single metal or even bimetallic catalysts in particular mesoporous molecular sieves acting as heterogeneous catalysts such as mcm 41 mcm 48 sba 15 and other silicon based materials have unique physical and chemical properties for example the highly ordered mesoporous structure provides a rapid diffusion channel for the reactant and product molecules the large pore volume and high surface area can carry more active sites and disperse the active sites well the abundant silanol groups enable easy modification of the surface properties and the flexible skeleton allows the metal active sites to be easily incorporated into silica materials 144 145 these excellent properties have led to many reports on the application of these materials in the fields of drug delivery 146 catalysis 147 heavy metal 148 149 and organic adsorption 150 151 and also demonstrated that mesoporous molecular sieves have broad prospects in the field of supported electrocatalysts 5 2 electrocatalyst synthesis and characterization 5 2 1 synthesis of electrocatalyst support mcm 41 is the most representative ordered mesoporous silica material in the m41s family its name comes from mobil oil corporation that proposed the liquid crystal template mechanism in 1992 that is mcm 41 was synthesized by using long chain cationic quaternary ammonium salt surfactant as the template 152 as shown in fig 11 a c 153 the m41s family can be divided into two dimensional hexagonal structure mcm 41 cubic structure mcm 48 and unstable layer materials mcm 50 according to different crystal structures 154 among these mcm 41 is the most studied type because other members of the m41s family are difficult to synthesize and have poor thermal stability as shown in fig 11d sba 15 in the santa barbara amorphous family sba is another mesoporous silica that is often reported in the literature the crystal structure is an ordered two dimensional hexagonal phase and the pore walls have many micropores it was successfully prepared by zhao et al 155 using hydrophilic triblock copolymer p123 as the template and tetraethyl orthosilicate as the silicon source as shown in fig 12 156 the synthesis strategy for obtaining these mesoporous silica whether m41s or sba is based on supramolecular self assembly of surfactants the more common method is hydrothermal synthesis 157 that is the template and silica precursor such as tetraethyl orthosilicate 158 or sodium metasilicate 159 are subjected to hydrothermal treatment and then the surfactant is removed by high temperature calcination to obtain the target product in addition methods such as the sol micelle method ultrasonic method and microwave synthesis method can also be used to obtain mesoporous silica 160 161 when the synthesized mesoporous silica is used as a catalyst it may lose its activity due to coke deposition to the organic matter covering the active center or blocking the pore channel and the change of catalyst structure caused by some reaction conditions therefore control of the synthesis conditions during the synthesis process is important for the preparation of a catalyst with high activity and high stability 162 163 in these synthesis operations the nature of the surfactant has the greatest influence on the structure of mesoporous silica under the same conditions a longer carbon chain of the surfactant results in larger pore size of the obtained mesoporous silica 164 in addition ph hydrothermal treatment time temperature change and other conditions will endow the silica with different pore characteristics and particle morphologies 165 166 for example ctab surfactant can produce highly ordered hexagonal pores in mesoporous silica if self assembly is carried out under strong alkaline conditions while self assembly under strong acidic conditions will lead to the formation of cubic mesopores 167 in another example mcm 41 materials are often synthesized under alkaline conditions ph 9 12 168 better silane alcohol condensation can occur in mesoporous silica obtained under alkaline conditions since the equipotential of silicon is found at ph 2 the synthesis of sba 15 must be carried out under strong acidic conditions the lower medium ph allows sba 15 material to obtain a highly ordered structure and thick pore walls and when metal ions are loaded an appropriate increase in the ph of the medium can increase the metal loading rate 169 these mesoporous silica materials are both nanostructures and nanoparticles they have a large adjustable pore size particularly sba 15 compared to other pore materials the thicker pore wall 3 6 nm endows them with good thermal stability hydrothermal stability and hydrolytic stability 170 171 165 the special structure and excellent characteristics make it a potential catalyst carrier in electrocatalysis 5 2 2 functionalization and characterization the functional modification of mesoporous silica is achieved by the reaction of the siloxane si o si and silanol si oh functional groups on the surface of the mesoporous matrix with specific molecules in particular the reaction of silanol groups direct reaction with hydroxyl is considered to be the main approach for modification fig 13 illustrates the two mechanisms of surface modification of mcm 41 mesoporous materials namely the co condensation method and the post synthesis method 153 the co condensation method also known as one pot synthetic method was first proposed by mann 172 in this method the functional agent was directly added into the synthesis system and co assembled with the amphiphilic surfactant template under certain reaction conditions to obtain the modified mesoporous materials this method has short preparation time but limits the concentration of modifier on the substrate surface 173 174 in the post synthesis method the mesoporous silica is modified after synthesis for functionalization using methods such as impregnation grafting and ion exchange 175 because the impregnation method is simple and easy to operate and can retain the ordered pore structure of the original molecular sieve to the greatest extent this method is often used to anchor the metal particles on the mesoporous support for example li et al 176 first synthesized mcm 41 by the hydrothermal method and then successfully prepared the mn xal mcm 41 catalyst by using the immersion method to anchor al and mn on the substrate fasanya et al 177 prepared cu zn mcm 41 catalysts by one pot synthesis and impregnation synthesis respectively it was found that the catalyst synthesized by impregnation method has the highest catalytic activity for methanol similar to mesoporous supports the successfully prepared electrocatalyst can be characterized by different techniques such as transmission electron microscopy tem scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd n2 adsorption desorption and fourier transform mid infrared spectroscopy ftir as shown in fig 14 a c gheno et al 178 used sem and tem to characterize sba 15 and al sba 15 through sem we can visually observe the microstructure of the catalyst and it can be seen that the introduction of al led to a reduction in the size of primary particles and an increase in particle irregularities tem can provide high resolution particle morphology information and the tem image presented in fig 14c clearly shows the highly ordered porous structure of the sba 15 carrier as shown in fig 15 a 179 the characteristic peaks of the low angle diffraction pattern at 100 110 200 show the characteristics of mesoporous materials with an ordered hexagonal close packed support structure sba 15 however the peak strength is significantly reduced after metal loading indicating that the long range order of the porosity of the hexagonal arrangement is reduced 180 the wide angle diffraction pattern in fig 15b proves that the metal elements are highly dispersed on the mesoporous support but the loading is low 181 in addition it was concluded that the small difference between the obtained ftir spectra fig 15c implies that the metal loading of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts prepared by the impregnation method is low resulting in little effect of the metal anchoring on the surface properties of sba 15 additionally the ftir spectrum also shows some typical absorption bands that can be used for sba 15 characterization for example the absorption bands at 799 and 1087 cm 1 can be attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of si o si 182 183 the surface area pore size and volume of mesoporous materials are determined by studying n2 adsorption desorption isotherms differences in the pore size and pore structure will cause the isotherms to follow different adsorption and desorption paths according to the iupac classification adsorption isotherms can be divided into six types among which type iv isotherms are suitable for mesoporous adsorbents such as mcm 41 and sba 15 184 as shown in fig 15d the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions of sba 15 and co mn sba 15 were obtained it is observed that co mn sba 15 and sba 15 have similar isotherms which means that the mesoporous structure is hardly affected by metal loading their specific surface area and pore volume can be calculated by the bet and bjh methods and the calculation results show that co mn sba 15 displayed significantly lower bet surface area and total pore volume than the parent sba 15 due to the deposition of the co and mn oxide clusters 5 3 related research in previous literature reports following the synthesis of catalysts such as sba 15 or mcm 41 researchers often use catalyst h2o2 or catalyst pms pds to oxidize and degrade the target pops with a separate fenton like process for example to degrade n n dimethyl p phenyl diamine dpd karthikeyan et al 185 synthesized sba 15 by the hydrothermal method and then successfully loaded cu and fe on sba 15 by impregnation to prepare the cu fe sba 15 fe sba 15 and cu sba 15 metal catalysts during the experiment a certain amount of catalyst and h2o2 were added to the target solution containing dpd the results showed that the catalytic performance of the bimetallic catalyst was the best with a dpd removal efficiency of 83 sun et al 186 prepared the fe co mcm 41 bimetallic catalyst fig 16 a by the one pot hydrothermal method and efficiently degraded methyl orange by activating pms the experimental results show that mo can be degraded by 95 7 in 60 min after treatment with fe co mcm 41 pms system which is higher than that of the fe mcm 41 pms system 80 6 the excellent catalytic activity of fe co mcm 41 was attributed to the high metal dispersion and the synergistic effect of the co2 co3 and fe2 fe3 redox cycles to degrade the fluorescent rhodamine b rhb dye xu et al 179 successfully synthesized sba 15 using p123 as the template and sodium metasilicate as the silicon source and co and mn were loaded on sba 15 by impregnation to prepare the co mn sba 15 bimetallic catalyst under mild conditions co mn sba 15 and pms were added to the target solution containing rhb to achieve up to 99 rhb removal within 45 min as shown in fig 16b the possible mechanism of pms activation by co mn sba 15 was proposed this mechanism is similar to the mechanism proposed by su et al 186 in both studies it was concluded that singlet oxygen 1o2 produced during pms decomposition plays a major role in rhb degradation in addition to the oxidative degradation of target pops by a fenton like reaction only the fenton like process can also be combined with visible light and ultraviolet light illumination ultrasonication and other techniques for example wang et al 187 synthesized cds sba 15 catalyst to degrade salicylic acid under visible light irradiation the results showed that under the synergistic action of visible light and cds sba 15 catalyst the degradation efficiency of salicylic acid reached 84 93 within 6 h lima et al 188 successfully loaded fe3o4 and wo3 on sba 15 support to prepare the fe3o4 wo3 sba 15 catalyst after the catalyst was added to the target solution the herbicide acid dichlorophenoxyacetic 2 4 d was photodegraded under ultraviolet irradiation and the results showed that the fe3o4 wo3 sba 15 catalyst promoted 90 73 of 2 4 d degradation within 4 h cai et al 189 prepared a co sba 15 catalyst and degraded acid orange 7 ao7 in the co sba 15 pms us process with the assistance of ultrasonication us the experimental results show that the removal rate of ao7 in the co sba 15 pms us process can reach 95 9 within 90 min under the same operating conditions which is much higher than the removal rate of the co sba 15 pms process only 67 1 additionally co sba 15 particles can be used repeatedly with excellent durability at the same time they 190 also prepared fe co sba 15 catalyst combined with ultrasonication to enhance the activation of sulfate for the degradation of orange ii in water in the 2 h reaction process the decolorization efficiency of fe co sba 15 pms us process for orange ii was 95 5 which was much higher than that of the fe co sba 15 pms process 25 2 indicating that there was a synergistic effect between us and the catalyst and us could significantly enhance the catalytic activity of the catalyst fig 17 a and b show the possible degradation mechanisms of the co sba 15 pms us and fe co sba 15 pms us systems respectively among a variety of technologies used in conjunction with fenton like processes eo technology is anticipated to be the most effective by adding catalyst pms pds to the electric reaction device efficient degradation of pops can be achieved by the eo fenton like process for example to eliminate the environmentally persistent azo dye orange ii cai et al 162 loaded fe and co on sba 15 to prepare the fe co sba 15 bimetallic catalyst and then used the eo fenton like process to degrade methyl orange ii in solution in the electrolysis device a dsa electrode φ 5 11 9 cm was used as anode and plate shaped stainless steel of the same size was used as the cathode and the reaction begins after the fe co sba 15 catalyst and pds are added to the reactor a series of characterizations showed that fe and co are well supported on sba 15 and the leaching rate of the metal particles in the bimetallic catalyst is lower than that of the single metal catalyst showing higher stability the decolorization rate of orange ii in the solution was determined to show the treatment effect of the process the results showed that within 60 min the decolorization rate of 89 4 was achieved by electrochemical treatment alone while the decolorization rate of 95 6 was achieved by the eo fe co sba 15 pds process the decolorization effect was significant indicating that the combination of the eo technology and fe co sba 15 pds process had a synergistic effect on the decolorization of orange ii in another study liu et al 163 prepared a mncu bimetallic oxide catalyst mn cu al mcm 41 supported on aluminum containing mcm 41 by the coprecipitation method in order to study the degradation of humic acid ha by the electro fenton chlorine process see fig 18 a the electrolysis device uses a platinum electrode with a size of φ 0 5 37 mm as the anode and a carbon felt cf with the dimensions of 40 50 5 mm as the cathode a quantity of catalyst and a fixed concentration of cacl2 and nacl were added to the electrolysis cup and the degradation experiment was performed under a given current density of 3 5 ma cm 2 fig 18a shows the degradation mechanism of ha it can be seen that a large amount of mn3 and cu are present on the surface of the mcm 41 catalyst and these ions promote the decomposition of h2o2 to oh moreover since the standard reduction potential of cu cu2 0 195 v is lower than mn3 mn4 0 95 v mn4 is reduced to mn3 by cu on the catalyst surface mn4 can also obtain electrons on the catalyst surface to generate mn3 and the continuous redox cycle of mn3 greatly improves the degradation ability of the process in addition since nacl and cacl2 are added to the solution the cl concentration also becomes an influencing factor for ha degradation in this system the experiments at different concentration of salinity were conducted and it was found that a cod degradation efficiency of approximately 90 can be obtained at a lower salinity range of 500 1000 mg l 1 but the degradation efficiency decreased greatly with increasing salinity this is because a higher concentration of chloride ions will be oxidized at the anode to produce more chlorine that will be completely transformed into hclo under the experimental condition of ph 6 and hclo will consume more cu mn3 and h2o2 resulting in a decrease in the oh output eqs 17 18 191 moreover cl will also consume the generated oh eq 19 184 which will inhibit the degradation of cod therefore for both a separate eo process and a combined process it is necessary to control the salinity within an appropriate range to improve the degradation efficiency 17 hclo cu mn 3 h e cu 2 mn 4 cl h 2 o 18 hclo h 2 o 2 3 h 4 e 2 cl 3 h 2 o 19 cl oh hcl o in other studies lin et al 192 used an eo fenton like process to degrade environmentally persistent clofibric acid cfa they loaded fe and cu on sba 15 support the total metal loading was 5 wt and the sample was named tm1 tm2 sba and prepared the fe cu sba 15 bimetallic catalyst the experiment was carried out in a 250 ml glass beaker using a dsa φ 5 11 9 cm anode and ti cathode with the initial ph set to 3 and the catalyst and pds added to the cfa solution under magnetic stirring fig 18b shows a schematic diagram of the cfa degradation process the cfa degradation pathways in this process can be divided into electrochemical direct oxidation and indirect oxidation of oh and so4 radicals and epr analysis shows that oh plays a major role in the degradation at the same time the experimental results showed that after 60 min of treatment cfa was completely removed under the synergistic effect of eo and fe cu sba 15 pds the degradation efficiency was much higher than the degradation efficiency 66 2 when the eo process was used alone and was also higher than the degradation efficiency of the 5cu sba 83 4 and 5fe sba 99 7 single metal catalysts it can be seen from the degradation efficiency of cfa that the eo fenton like process is an effective process for oxidative degradation of pops in water particularly when bimetallic catalysts are used although there have been few reports in the literature on the eo fenton process in recent years the above literature survey shows that this process has good prospects in the field of pops processing and other emerging technologies can be explored to enhance the pops processing ability of the eo process at the same time the above studies also show that reasonable electrode material modification and reactor design as well as the addition of high performance electrocatalysts can achieve efficient wastewater treatment whereas many researchers have found that the use of eo technology alone for the complete mineralization of high concentration persistent organic wastewater incurs high energy consumption and is not economically feasible therefore the combination of eo technology and other processes is currently a research hotspot and is also the basis for the application of the eo technology in practical industrial use 6 combination of eo and other water treatment processes the development of eo technology is no longer limited to the treatment of simulated wastewater in the laboratory and has now been applied to the practical treatment of various types of wastewaters however its large scale application is still limited by high energy consumption unlike for academic research that focuses on obtaining high efficiency of pollutant removal the cost of long term operation must be considered in the practical treatment of industrial wastewater therefore the combination of eo technology and other water treatment technologies as illustrated in fig 19 makes eo technology suitable for use in the pretreatment or post treatment steps of wastewater treatment process or for use as a part of an integrated one step treatment involving other technologies the combination of eo and other technologies is an effective strategy for the enabling the wider use of the eo technology in practical applications 6 1 pretreatment anaerobic aerobic biological treatment is a relatively mature water treatment technology that has been widely used in the field of wastewater treatment it is based on the use of the biological activities of microorganisms to treat organic wastewater however this approach is ineffective for the treatment of the wastewater with pollutants that have high biological toxicity such as antibiotics and pesticides by contrast electrochemical oxidation technology can be used for the pretreatment of such wastewater in order to improve its biodegradability in one example of this approach santhanam et al 193 used a combination of eo light induced degradation slip and biological treatment to treat structurally stable and difficult to biodegrade heterocyclic aromatic compounds in textile wastewater they used the ruo2 tio2 ti expanded network as the anode and the ti expanded network as the cathode and performed continuous electrochemical oxidation for 40 min the results showed that the auxiliaries and dyes in the textile wastewater are oxidized to aromatic intermediates improving the biodegradability of the wastewater but this process is also accompanied by the production of active chlorine that affects the subsequent biological treatment therefore a sunlight induced degradation step is added between the electrochemical oxidation and biological treatment the increase of this step can reduce active chlorine substances in the absence of photolysis the overall treatment efficiency was 22 and reached 71 after photolysis in another study fudala ksiazek et al 194 used bdd electrodes with different boron doping concentrations as oxidation anodes to pretreat landfill leachate containing a large amount of ammonia nitrogen and various organic substances in the experiment the refractory bisphenol a in the waste liquid was used as an indicator to measure the degradation efficiency the study found that after 8 h of eo treatment all organic matter in the waste liquid was completely mineralized no intermediate products were produced and the final waste liquid only contained a large amount of ammonia that can easily reach the emission target after the subsequent biological treatment to date many researchers have studied the feasibility of eo technology for the pretreatment of various types of wastewaters for example trellu et al 195 used a process coupled with eo technology and aerobic biological treatment to remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in contaminated soil in this process the removal of cod accorded with the first order kinetic model and the comparative experiment was carried out after the optimal reaction conditions were determined the results show that a cod removal rate of 71 can be obtained by eo treatment alone for 5 h and the power consumption is high reaching 67 kwh kg cod 1 however after a short period of eo pretreatment followed by biodegradation the energy consumption is greatly reduced to approximately 30 kwh kg cod 1 and the removal rate of cod increased to reach 80 this result shows that the combined process is an effective approach for improving the treatment efficiency and reducing the treatment cost to improve the biodegradability of soil washing wastewater carboneras et al 196 used four anode materials ir mmo ru mmo psi bbd cf to electrochemically oxidize the wastewater their results showed that for low current charge the toxicity of wastewater increases and the biodegradability decreases but when the current charge exceeds 2 5a h dm 3 the toxicity is significantly reduced and the bod5 cod ratio increases from 0 02 to 0 23 xu et al 197 used two sets of samples where the first group of samples used eo technology to pretreat the waste activated sludge was for 60 min followed by anaerobic biological treatment for 9 d and the no pretreatment was performed for the second group used as a control group after 8 d of pretreatment the contents of total dissolved phosphorus orthophosphate and organic phosphorus in the waste liquid were respectively 5 3 9 2 and 2 7 times lower than those of the control group and the soluble chemical oxygen demand was also far higher than that of the control group analysis showed that electrochemical pretreatment promotes sludge decomposition resulting in the release of phosphorus and organic matter that is beneficial for the subsequent anaerobic treatment the cost of this process was also analyzed and the results showed that although the treatment cost of the combined process 2 00 t was was slightly higher than that of the traditional anaerobic process 1 80 t was the economic value of the fertilizer collected by the combined process 0 83 t was was much higher than that of the single process 0 23 t was economic evaluation shows that the combined process has positive economic value for the recovery of phosphorus from was and it also provides a new approach for the recovery of phosphorus from sludge similarly pęziak kowalska et al 198 used a combined process of eo and biological treatment for the degradation of herbicidal ionic liquids hils after 3 h of the electrochemical treatment of hils continuous biological treatment was carried out studies have shown that the wastewater mineralization rate after the combined process treatment can reach up to 57 far exceeding the rate 8 obtained for the control sample without electrochemical pretreatment thus electrochemical oxidation increased the mineralization rate of hils proving the reliability of eo pretreatment 6 2 post processing when eo technology is used as a post treatment step for wastewater it is often used to degrade inorganic particles or pops in the treatment of distiller grain wastewater the effluent will contain some refractory organics and biological activity inhibitors because biological treatment cannot achieve complete mineralization therefore vilar et al 199 used eo technology to post treat the effluent in the case of biological optimization treatment after eo treatment the final waste liquid color removal rate reaches 100 the cod removal rate is 66 and the toc removal rate is 61 the researchers used the waste liquid after the treatment to water the crops and found that the toxicity of the waste liquid was completely removed with zero lethality for the crops in other studies soriano et al 200 designed an enhanced treatment method combining membrane separation and eo technology to address the difficulties in the removal of perfluoroalkyl acid in the early stage of treatment nanofiltration membrane nf90 and reverse osmosis membrane bw30 were used to capture and concentrate perfluoroalkyl acid in the water and then eo technology was used to oxidize the concentrate after treatment the concentration of perfluoroalkyl acid in the effluent was less than 70 ng l 1 reaching the drinking water standard cost analysis of this process showed that the preconcentration method can significantly improve the conductivity of the electrolyte reduce the energy consumption of electrolysis and obtain the lowest total cost 13 1 m 3 when applying higher current similarly using four drugs in the wastewater as treatment indicators ouarda et al 201 used a combination of membrane bioreactor and eo technology to treat hospital wastewater and compared the treatment effects of the eo technology used in the pretreatment and post treatment steps the results showed that the optimal performance was obtained when a membrane bioreactor is used to treat the wastewater first and then the eo technology is used for post treatment the removal rate of the four types of drugs in the wastewater reached 97 which is higher than the treatment effect 90 when the eo technology is used in the pretreatment step 6 3 integrated processing in addition to using eo technology in the pre treatment and post treatment steps an integrated treatment process without a specific sequence can be used to form a system for wastewater treatment through a combination of multiple water treatment processes for example cui et al 202 designed an eo upflow biological aerated filter electrodialysis integrated system for the removal of triazole fungicides from wastewater the results showed that the cod level of the effluent was only 58 32 mg l 1 the toc level was 20 56 mg l 1 the removal rate of nitrogen heterocyclic pollutants was over 90 and the removal rate of salt pollutants was 99 fully demonstrating the excellent treatment efficiency of the system compared to other reported methods it was found that the treatment cost of the eo upflow biological aerated filter electrodialysis integrated system is lower 0 78 t and is also lower than the local industrial wastewater price 0 92 t this provides a preliminary proof of the application value of the integrated system in the treatment of triazole fungicide wastewater in addition the complex composition of wastewater produced by the petrochemical industry and food processing industry that contains a variety of difficult to biodegradable substances and heavy metal ions poses difficulties for treatment with general treatment technologies therefore lee et al 203 developed the dissolved air flotation eo magnetic biochar integrated system to treat suspended solids complex organics and heavy metals in wastewater respectively finally 99 7 of oil 95 of cod and more than 90 of metals in the wastewater were removed including copper arsenic lead and other heavy metal ions that were adsorbed by magnetic biochar and effectively recovered in other studies li et al 204 designed an electro flocculation carbon membrane coupled eo integrated system for the removal of oily substances in petrochemical and food industry wastewater the oily wastewater first passes through the electro flocculation device in this step most of the oil forms flocs are removed and the remaining small part of the oil flows through the tubular carbon membrane to the electrochemical oxidation device the tubular carbon membrane can not only separate oil droplets but also can be used as an oxidation anode most of the oil droplets are completely mineralized in the electrochemical oxidation device and the final oil content of the effluent is below 30 mg l 1 demonstrating that the device has excellent oil removal performance in the integrated system the combined technology of ultrasonic assist and electrochemical oxidation is also an attractive process for example dietrich et al 205 used ultrasound assisted electrochemical oxidation technology to degrade bisphenol a bpa experimental results show that when the initial concentration is 1 mg l 1 the combined system can remove more than 90 of bpa within 30 min the reaction follows pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0 089 min 1 which is consistent with the results of xu et al 206 ren et al 207 also used ultrasound assisted electrochemical technology to degrade phenol under optimal operating conditions phenol can be completely removed within 1 h which is far more effective than a single process ultrasound 16 electrochemistry 32 in the ultrasonic assisted electrochemical oxidation technology in addition to using the cavitation effect to degrade organic pollutants 208 ultrasound can also cooperate with the electrochemical oxidation technology to increase the mass transfer rate and chemical reaction rate to increase the degree of mineralization and reduce electrode passivation and scaling problem it can be seen that this technology has excellent prospects in the field of persistent organic pollutants treatment 209 210 some research examples of eo technology combined with other water treatment technologies in recent years are listed in table 5 it was found that the combined technology can treat all kinds of pops that are difficult to completely purify using a single process and result in great improvement of the treatment efficiency therefore a key direction of eo technology research in the future is to develop combinations of eo with various water treatment processes overcome the shortcomings of high energy consumption of eo technology and realize the efficient treatment of large volumes of industrial wastewater or decentralized and domestic wastewater with lower cost and shorter time by constructing simple and easy to operate treatment devices 7 conclusions and prospects after years of development electrochemical oxidation has become the most promising wastewater treatment technology it has shown excellent performance and for both the mineralization treatment for pops and the detoxification treatment of highly biologically toxic organics and has been widely recognized as a leading technology in the field of wastewater treatment to date eo technology has been applied in actual wastewater treatment to some extent but i most investigations are still in the laboratory stage and lack practical applications ii in addition most of the wastewater used in the experiment is a single component wastewater configured in the laboratory but the actual wastewater often has complex and varied composition and is influenced by multiple factors unfortunately research in this area has been insufficient iii electrode materials play the key role in eo technology so that future research will focus on the research and development of new electrode materials the design of excellent electrode structure and the optimization of efficient electrode preparation process iv the elucidation of the mechanism of the oxidation of organic matter in eo technology is of fundamental importance for improving the efficiency of the electrochemical system to degrade organic matter and will also provide the basis for the implementation of these systems in industrial use therefore it is necessary to further elucidate the modification mechanism and oxidation mechanism of electrode materials v the rational design of an efficient mass transfer reactor is vital for improving the efficiency of electrochemical oxidation vii the excellent structural characteristics of mesoporous materials such as sba 15 and mcm 41 are not only beneficial for the synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts but also enable a new approach for the synthesis of novel electrocatalyst materials however the application of molecular sieves still has many shortcomings such as the insufficient stability and hydrothermal stability of the heteroatom loaded molecular sieves and the high cost of the template agent to obtain greater application value further improvements are necessary vii in addition the combination of eo technology with biological treatment adsorption filtration membrane and other treatment processes in a high efficiency integrated system to reduce the treatment cost and improve the biochemical and treatment efficiency of refractory organic matter is also the hot spot of cutting edge eo development most of the literature reports cited in this review focus on basic research performed in the laboratory whereas there have been few reports on the scale up of laboratory devices and industrial field experiments therefore for greater application of eo technology to industry practice the actual on site conditions should be simulated and a special pilot study should be carried out to determine the actual limitations on site and verify the feasibility of laboratory process after scale up all of the above problems require in depth investigations to obtain significant breakthroughs and enable the wide use of eo technology for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments this work

13238,over the years industry agriculture and other human activities have discharged a large number of organic pollutants into the natural environment among these persistent organic pollutants pops mainly represented by polychlorinated biphenyls pcb and aldrin have attracted intense attention to achieve the safe discharge of wastewater a variety of treatment technologies have been used to effectively eliminate the pops in water this article reviews the currently most promising approach of electrochemical oxidation eo technology introduces its basic principles and describes the research progress and application status of electrode materials electrochemical reactors and electrocatalysts at the same time the effects of operating conditions such as current density and electrolyte type on the degradation effect are discussed finally the performance of the combination of eo technology and other water treatment technologies is summarized in these processes we discussed in detail the directions for improvement and potential mechanisms of eo technology and found that the choice of appropriate operating conditions can not only improve the processing efficiency but also reduces the processing cost for example for different pops different supporting electrolytes are selected and the ph value of the reaction is controlled however we should note that electrode optimization is always the core of eo technology improvement and the use of high efficiency electrocatalysts and the combination of combined processes are promising for the broader use of eo technology graphical

electrochemical oxidation eo anodes electrocatalyst combination electrochemical process 1 introduction the total amount of freshwater resources in the world is limited and many countries are currently facing multiple problems related to water resources with the shortage waste and pollution of water resources constituting the three most serious problems among these water pollution is the most critical current issues 1 compared to biological pollution such as red tides or physical pollution such as suspended solids the chemical pollution caused by organic compounds produced by industry agriculture medicine and human activities and discharged into water bodies is the most serious and has the most far reaching impact organochlorine pesticides including ddt aldrin chlordane polychlorinated biphenyls pcb polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes dioxins and perfluoroalkyl acids pfas are some examples of such pollutant organic compounds 2 3 in addition printing and dyeing wastewater and antibiotics that meet the persistence conditions can also be included in this category 4 5 these compounds have high resistance to biodegradation photolysis and biodegradation and can exist for a long time once they are discharged into the environment although most pops exist in trace amounts in the environment they can migrate through various media and reach extremely remote areas they can also accumulate in organisms reach toxic concentrations through the biological amplification of the food chain and ultimately affect human consumers 6 7 additionally their carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic effects can make them highly dangerous even at low concentrations 3 since the united nations environment program adopted the stockholm convention in 2001 global consensus has been achieved regarding the great harm of pops and the urgent need to eliminate them 4 in the past few decades researchers have adopted various technical means to eliminate pops in water for example dixit et al 8 used ion exchange to remove pfas in water alardhi et al 9 10 used mesoporous materials to adsorb dye pollutants in water and cuozzo et al 11 used streptomyces for the biodegradation of chlordane although these traditional physical biological and chemical treatment methods have different characteristics and advantages efficient removal of pops is still difficult as can be observed from the detection results of pops in water animals and plants worldwide 12 13 the unsatisfactory performance of the conventional treatment methods and the increasingly severe water pollution have motivated an increasing ongoing research effort for the development of new treatment methods in particular electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops such as plasma oxidation fenton oxidation ozonation and electrochemical oxidation eo technologies have emerged as the most promising methods for wastewater treatment 14 15 in these methods organic matter is degraded by directly exchanging electrons or generating radicals with strong oxidizing properties in particular the hydroxyl radicals oh in the eaops process electrochemical oxidation eo technology has distinct advantages 16 17 due to its lack of a need for complex equipment required for plasma oxidation technology and the lack of the secondary pollution that may be caused by fenton oxidation technology eo technology has excellent wastewater treatment performance characteristics such as i the treatment equipment is simple and requires little floor space ii the treatment process is clean the amount of discharge is low and essentially no secondary pollution is generated making eo an environmentally friendly technology iii the treatment cycle is short the operation is convenient and the controllability is excellent 18 iv the treatment conditions are mild enabling the application of this method to a variety of wastewater treatment situations its many practical advantages make eo a highly promising prospective technology for the treatment of wastewater containing pops 19 21 recent studies on the degradation of pops by eo technology in water are reviewed in this paper first the basic principle of eo technology is briefly discussed in order to better analyze and understand the key factors and characteristics of the process as shown in fig 1 22 the key influencing factors of electrochemical oxidation process include electrode materials electrochemical reactor anode cathode distance current density electrolyte type and concentration solution ph and initial pollutant concentration among these key factors the electrode materials and electrochemical reactor are the main focus of this review and the anode cathode distance current density electrolyte type and concentration solution ph and initial pollutant concentration are discussed as operating parameters for obtaining optimal performance in addition the principle preparation and performance characteristics of the electrocatalysts are introduced finally the combination of eo technology and other water treatment processes is emphasized because the development of integrated technology is a key step for the transfer of eo technology from the laboratory to industrial application 2 fundamentals eo applies the basic electrolysis mechanism in the treatment process direct current is applied to the wastewater fig 2 in order to oxidize and reduce the pops in the wastewater at the anode and cathode poles respectively through the electrolysis process 23 24 converting them to easily biodegradable low molecular weight substances with low toxicity that can then be easily treated with biological treatments in some cases complete mineralization of organic matter can be achieved by the electrolysis so that the pops are completely converted into harmless substances such as co2 and h2o to achieve wastewater purification 25 26 the pops in wastewater are mainly degraded by anodic oxidation that can be divided into direct oxidation and indirect oxidation 28 29 no evident degradation is found at the cathode but organic matter can be dechlorinated at the cathode dechlorination can reduce the toxicity of wastewater which is beneficial for the subsequent biological treatment process 2 1 direct oxidation as shown in fig 3 a direct oxidation means that after organic pollutants are adsorbed on the surface of the anode they undergo direct charge transfer from the electrode therefore the organic pollutants are oxidized the molecular chains are broken and the molecular weight drops rapidly this process can be expressed as 1 r p e where r and p represent the high molecular organic pollutants and oxidized matter respectively the direct oxidation at the anode has two characteristics i the occurrence of direct oxidation of the organic pollutants at the anode requires a diffusion process that is the organic pollutants are adsorbed from the electrolyte solution to the anode surface and this process limits the oxidation rate 30 ii the direct oxidation rate mainly depends on the electrocatalytic activity of the anode material and the applied current intensity and is not affected by other oxidizing substances however in the direct oxidation process the direct interaction between electrons and organic matter mainly occurs at the anode potential that is lower than the oxygen evolution reaction oer potential 29 and the relatively low oxidation potential leads to the lower oxidation ability of the anode for direct oxidation compared to indirect oxidation direct oxidation shows low oxidation efficiency 31 2 2 indirect oxidation indirect oxidation refers to the following process under the action of an external current through an anodic oxidation reaction intermediate products with strong oxidation effect are produced on the electrode surface or the interface of the solution environment 32 such as hydroxyl radicals oh ozone o3 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and other oxidizing particles eqs 2 and 3 33 if so4 2 cl and po4 3 are present in the wastewater oxidizing particles such as s2o8 2 cl2 hclo and p2o8 4 may also be produced eqs 4 and 5 34 35 these oxidizing particles react with organic pollutants through processes such as electron transfer double bond addition ring opening and group removal to achieve efficient degradation of organic pollutants 36 37 the initial oxidation reaction occurs on the electrode surface and subsequent degradation of the pollutants occurs in the electrolyte solution phase so that indirect oxidation can be subdivided into electrode surface indirect oxidation and electrolyte solution phase indirect oxidation 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 3 3 h 2 o o 3 6 h 6 e 4 2 hso 4 s 2 o 8 2 2 h 2 e 5 2 po 4 3 p 2 o 8 4 2 e 2 2 1 electrode surface indirect oxidation among the active oxygen species produced by the electrode reaction oh is the main oxidizing species because it is produced in large amounts and has a high oxidation potential 2 8 v while its oxidizing power is second only to fluorine oh has a very short life 10 9 s that makes it difficult for it to diffuse in the electrolyte solution so that its oxidation reaction occurs mainly on the electrode surface 30 oh is mainly produced by electrolysis of water at the anode m as described by eq 6 6 m h 2 o m oh h e after oh is produced it will be adsorbed on the anode surface based on the electrode properties active electrodes and inactive electrodes 38 39 the adsorption is also divided into the categories of chemical adsorption and physical adsorption these two adsorption states correspond to two different oxidation mechanisms 40 41 as is shown in the schematic diagrams presented in fig 3b and c a classification of the most common anodes for eo and their basic properties can be found in table 1 for active electrodes 42 such as graphite platinum pt iridium dioxide iro2 and ruthenium dioxide ruo2 oh is chemically adsorbed on the electrode surface that is the oh produced by the electrolysis of water will react with the active anode and the anode will bond to the oxygen in oh to form a chemically adsorbed mo in the anode lattice the reaction can be described as follows 7 m oh mo h e for inactive electrodes such as boron doped diamond 43 and lead dioxide electrode pbo2 oh is physically adsorbed on the electrode surface without the formation of chemical bonds when mo is formed on the surface of the active electrode the oxidation activity of oh will be weakened the lower oxidation performance makes it difficult to completely mineralize organic pollutants and leads to only a partial oxidation of organic pollutants into biodegradable intermediate products including compounds such as short chain carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones 32 45 while the oh on the surface of the inactive electrode still has strong oxidation activity and can completely mineralize some pops and directly convert them into co2 and h2o 2 2 2 indirect oxidation of the electrolyte solution phase although oxidizing particles such as h2s2o8 cl2 hclo and clo are not as oxidizing as oh their long lifetime in solution enables them to oxidize organic pollutants on the electrode surface and at the same time diffuse into the electrolyte solution and react with organic pollutants 46 47 as shown in fig 4 a and b different active substances are produced by the reaction described by eqs 8 12 8 m oh cl m hclo 9 m hclo 1 2 cl 2 oh 10 2 cl cl 2 aq 2 e 11 cl 2 aq h 2 o hclo cl h 12 hclo h cl o although the long lifetime enables h2s2o8 cl2 hclo clo and other oxidizing particles to fully react with the organic pollutants in the electrolyte solution their reactivity is weaker than that of oh so that they cannot mineralize organic pollutants but rather only convert them into intermediate products with lower toxicity the presence of a large amount of cl in wastewater not only produces cl2 hclo clo and other chlorine active substances in the solution but also can produce some highly toxic organic chlorine by products such as chlorate and perchlorate 48 therefore radjenovic et al 49 believe that a critical chlorine concentration in wastewater exists that is beneficial for the removal of pollutants but still produces a low and acceptable amount of highly toxic by products 3 electrodes in eo technology the electrode is the most important component and the material and performance of the electrode directly determine the cost and efficiency of the oxidation process the oxidation reaction in the eo process mainly occurs at the anode and the catalytic activity and stability of the anode are the key factors that determine its oxidation capacity and working life therefore most researchers have focused on the preparation of anode materials with high performance low cost and suitability for practical applications through selection of suitable materials design of favorable structures and improvement of the preparation process as shown in fig 5 research on eo anodes has focused first on graphite and pure metal electrodes then the dimensionally stable anode dsa boron doped diamond bdd electrodes and sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode were introduced and have been investigated in many recent studies 3 1 graphite and pure metal electrodes in the early stage of research on wastewater treatment by eo graphite electrodes and pure metal electrodes were mainly used 53 both graphite and pure metal materials have the advantages of excellent electrical properties low cost and easy preparation of electrodes and therefore are widely used in wastewater treatment for example yong et al 54 used exfoliated graphite eg as the oxidation anode to electrochemically degrade methyl orange mo in artificial textile wastewater under the operating conditions of current density of 13 ma cm 2 ph 2 0 and electrolyte concentration of 0 1 mol dm 3 and electrolysis for 20 min the removal rate of pigment in wastewater reaches 98 0 and an excellent removal effect is obtained sivodia et al 55 investigated the removal of the environmentally persistent cytarabine cbn anticancer drug and used graphite electrodes as the oxidation anodes to degrade cbn the results show that the entire eo process is dominated by indirect oxidation with cl2 and hclo as the main oxidants a kinetic study was performed to determine the changes of the reaction rate during electrolysis it was found that the kinetic rate constant varied between 0 15 and 0 07 min 1 at ph 3 7 respectively indicating that lower ph values are beneficial to cbn degradation under the reaction conditions of the current density of 10 ma cm 2 and ph of 3 the removal rate of cbn reached 95 after 60 min of electrolysis the metal electrodes used in eo technology include al fe ti and platinum group metals when al and fe are used as anodes they can not only degrade organic pollutants through oxidation but also form colloidal particles in the electrolyte solution fig 6 relying on electric flocculation to separate the colloidal impurities in the wastewater by coagulation precipitation or air floatation for example kumari et al 56 studied the treatment of acetaminophen and natural organic matter in river water with aluminum as the anode and found that the best treatment conditions are reaction time of 60 min inter electrode distance of 2 cm and voltage of 9 v the removal effects of aluminum as the anode and iron as the anode were compared and it was found that the aluminum anode is more effective than the iron anode based on the post treatment x ray diffraction analysis they explained that the main mechanism of the degradation process is based on the formation of hydrogen bonds between acetaminophen and aluminum hydroxide 3 2 metal oxide electrodes metal oxide electrodes have good stability and high catalytic activity are often used as anode materials and are known as dimensionally stable anode dsa the industrial application of dsa has a history of more than 30 years 58 it is mainly used in environmental pollution control 59 fuel cells and chemical raw material preparation 60 in particular 90 of the electrodes used in production in chlor alkali industry are dsa electrodes the dsa used in the early days consisted only of metal oxides such as pbo2 sno2 iro2 and ruo2 compared to graphite electrodes and pure metal electrodes the conductivity and corrosion resistance of these oxide electrodes is improved but their mechanical strength and erosion resistance are poor to obtain higher application value researchers have continued to optimize the dsa and developed a new generation of dsa composed of a substrate and a metal oxide film various materials such as ceramics pt ti and fe have been explored for use as substrates among which titanium based are the most widely used when titanium is used as an anode directly it spontaneously forms a protective oxide film on the electrode causing the surface resistance to be too high however a large number of studies have found that the titanium matrix can form a contact interface with some metals and conductive oxides with low resistance since then ti based substrates have become popular metal substrates for research and applications due to their good stability and conductivity and a variety of ti based dsas have been developed see fig 7 51 61 ken et al 53 used ti ruo2 as the oxidation anode and used stable temperature resistant and durable graphite as the cathode to construct an eo device for the degradation of coke oven wastewater and determined the optimal electrolysis parameters the experimental results show that under the conditions of the initial ph of 8 0 electrolyte nacl concentration of 1 6 g l 1 and current density of 24 ma cm 2 90 of organic pollutants were eliminated within 180 min the morphological study fesem edx proved that after multiple cycles of treatment there is no significant physical change on the anode surface and the electrode has good stability jiang et al 62 used thermal sintering to form an iro2 coating on the ti substrate and successfully prepared a ti iro2 electrode that was then used to pretreat tnt red water to improve its biodegradability to better investigate the electrochemical treatment mechanism of tnt red water zero order pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic equations were used to fit the cod removal rates obtained under different conditions the results show that in the process of electrochemical degradation of organic pollutants in tnt red water the removal of cod follows the pseudo secondary model subsequent electrochemical analysis showed that the ti iro2 electrode had a strong oxidation effect on organic pollutants in tnt red water after electrolysis for 30 h all no2 functional groups in tnt red water were degraded in depth studies of dsa electrodes have found that the doping of metal and non metal elements can further improve the performance of dsa this is because the doping of elements will form surface defects such as crystal plane steps and dislocations in the electrode coating these defects in the electrode can increase the number of electron transfer channels and improve the conductivity and catalytic activity of the electrode accelerating the electrochemical reaction process on the electrode surface and improving the current efficiency at the same time the overpotential for the oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution carried out at the modified electrode will increase 68 69 the doping of elements can also avoid the formation of a polymer film on the surface of the electrode that hinders electron transfer and ensures that the electrode will maintain high catalytic oxidation activity under long term operation 70 71 wang et al 72 used different amounts of rare earth yb element to dope ti sno2 ruo2 electrodes and found that 1 5 yb doping increases the oxygen evolution potential and electrocatalytic oxidation activity of the electrode kinetic analysis showed that the degradation process of toc in coking wastewater is consistent with the first order kinetic equation when the current density is 10 ma cm 2 the reaction rate constant is the largest 0 1834 min 1 and therefore this current density was identified as the optimal current condition under this condition the cod removal rate of coking wastewater reached 85 06 after electrolysis for 30 min in other studies liu et al 73 used a sol gel route to synthesize ruo2 doped iro2 zro2 ternary oxide coatings with different ru ir zr molar ratios to study the effect of the different amounts of ru doping of ti iro2 zro2 electrodes analysis of the electrode surface morphology and electrochemical behavior found that with the increasing ru content the porosity and cracking of the ternary oxide coating were significantly increased improving the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode but reducing its stability the experimental results showed that a compact coating structure with good electrocatalytic activity and the longest service life are obtained for the ru content of 21 mol in the application of the ti based coating electrode due to the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and metal oxide coating a mismatch at the interface will arise due to the heating during electrochemical degradation that may lead to the fracture and spalling of the coating and finally electrode deactivation to solve this problem an intermediate coating was added to improve the stability and working life of the electrode duan et al 74 prepared a novel composite electrode gns pbo2 based on ti pbo2 by composite electrodeposition as shown in fig 8 ti acts as the substrate for the electrode on which a sno2 sb2o3 layer an α pbo2 layer a β pbo2 inner layer a gns layer and a β pbo2 outer layer are sequentially deposited duan et al used 2 chlorophenol as the target to determine the electrochemical performance and stability of gns pbo2 and ti pbo2 electrodes compared to the traditional pbo2 electrodes gns pbo2 not only shows a larger electrochemical active surface area and stronger oh generation ability but also has almost twice longer service life 107 9 h compared to 55 9 h for the traditional pbo2 electrode and shows a significantly higher electrochemical degradation rate constant after many runs no significant decrease in the activity of the gns pbo2 electrode was observed indicating that the electrode has excellent stability and reusability during the electrochemical oxidation process in another study li et al 75 used the impregnation method to prepare ti fto sno2 sb electrodes to study the influence of the fto interlayer on the electrode structure and life the results show that with the introduction of the fto intermediate layer the electrode surface becomes smoother and the crystallite size decreased effectively improving the crack phenomenon on the electrode surface during the anodic oxidation process the fto intermediate layer greatly delays the formation of the titanium dioxide insulating layer and improves the electrode life in addition considering the good distribution properties of nanomaterials and in particular the high specific surface area and the tip effect of nanostructures that also maintain excellent physical and electrochemical properties the application of nanotechnology in the field of electrode fabrication has attracted increased research attention for example zhang et al 76 successfully prepared nano ti zno electrodes by loading nano zno particles on a ti sheet for electrochemical oxidation of perfluorinated compounds pfc in wastewater under the conditions of a current density of 50 ma cm 2 and an electrode plate distance of 0 5 cm the degradation efficiency of pfcs reached 65 84 after reaction for 40 min this value is much higher than that of ordinary anodes indicating that nano zno plays an important role in the electrochemical process chianeh et al 77 also successfully coated sno2 nanoparticles on the surface of ti substrate by electrophoretic deposition technology to prepare nano sno2 ti electrode sem images show that the sno2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the surface of the ti substrate and these stacked nanoparticles greatly increase the porosity and specific surface area of the electrode using this electrode to treat azo dyes the experimental results show that under the best conditions 93 2 of the decolorization rate can be obtained in 16 min in addition for the ti pbo2 electrode the coating of β pbo2 could be easily exfoliated from the substrate resulting in the leakage of the toxic pb element to solve this problem man et al 78 chose to modify the pbo2 electrode by doping sic nanoparticles a series of characterization results showed that the nano sic was successfully doped in the catalytic coating of β pbo2 grains subsequently toluene diamine tda was degraded by eo technology using the ti sic pbo2 electrode and electrolyzed for 2 h under a current density of 50 ma cm 2 when the initial tda concentration was 0 05 g l 1 and 0 10 g l 1 tda can be completely removed and the cod removal rates of the solution were 95 22 and 81 48 respectively the cod removal process in all concentrations followed the pseudo first order kinetics model and the rate constants kcod of the mineralization process were 1 0229 h 1 and 0 5063 h 1 respectively this process showed that the absolute tda removal amount increases and the decomposition process was more effective when the initial tda concentration was higher the subsequent accelerated life test of the electrode showed that the accelerated life of the electrode was 61 8 h approximately 3 times longer than that of the traditional pbo2 electrode demonstrating that the ti sic pbo2 electrode had higher stability and reusability these results showed that nano material doping is an effective approach for improving electrode performance dsa electrode has always been active in the field of electrochemical oxidation of wastewater the lower production cost and better electrochemical performance have made it favored by many researchers table 2 shows some research examples of dsa electrodes in various types of wastewaters in recent years the researchers improved the dsa electrode from the aspects of element composition and preparation process and selected the best operating conditions to improve the wastewater treatment capacity of the technology fully demonstrating that dsa electrode is an electrodes material with excellent electrical performance that is highly promising for use in wastewater treatment 3 3 boron doped diamond bdd electrodes diamond is a well known allotrope of carbon and shows excellent thermal conductivity good heat dissipation extremely high hardness and stable chemical properties its multiple advantageous characteristics make it a popular and widely used material however the breakdown voltage of diamond can reach 3 58 106 v cm 1 its band gap exceeds 5 ev and its conductivity is extremely low hindering its application to electrode materials in the late 1990s researchers doped boron into diamond and obtained a new material with excellent electrical conductivity without changing its other characteristics this enabled the fabrication of the novel boron doped diamond bdd electrode successful modifications endow bdd have many following excellent properties 86 87 i bdd electrodes have high mechanical strength corrosion resistance and stable chemical properties that lead to their long service life and high stability ii they have a high oxygen evolution overpotential and a wide potential window that reduces the oxygen evolution side reaction during the oxidation process at the electrode can generate a large number of strong oxidizing free radicals and have a stronger oxidation ability iii they have a low background current and low energy consumption iv the electrode surface is inert and has low adsorption capacity endowing the electrode with self cleaning ability that can effectively prevent electrode contamination in a recent study liu et al 88 revealed the water oxidation and radical oh production mechanism using spin polarized density functional theory dft calculations carried out using the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp code the calculation results show that the gibbs free energy of m oh 2 82 ev on the bdd anode is much higher than that of the oh radical 2 4 ev making the production of oh radical on bdd anode more thermodynamically favorable compared to o2 evolution this result is consistent with the conclusion of devadas et al 89 and both studies indicate that the bdd electrode has a high oxygen evolution overpotential and can produce a large amount of oh the excellent performance of the bdd electrode makes its use a highly promising approach for the electrochemical oxidation treatment of wastewater in other studies ukundimana et al 90 compared the treatment effects of the dbb electrode and four dsa electrodes ti pto2 iro2 ti ruo2 tio2 ti ruo2 iro2 and ti iro2 ta2o5 on ultrafiltration uf effluent from a landfill leachate treatment plant it was found that the performance of the bdd anode under the test conditions is superior to that of the other dsa anodes and the removal rates of toc and cod were 64 9 86 8 and 68 2 92 0 respectively in another study zazou et al 91 compared the oxidation efficiency and mineralization ability of pt dsa ti pto2 iro2 and bdd electrodes for 1 2 dichlorobenzene three electrodes of the same size 4 6 0 2 cm were used as the anode and carbon felt electrodes were used as the cathode under the same operating conditions the reaction was carried out for 180 min the experimental results show that the mineralization efficiency of dsa is poor and is only 35 but the toc removal rates of the pt and bdd electrodes are 80 and 90 respectively this can be explained by the high conductivity of pt and the high oxygen evolution potential of bdd in particular the bdd electrode has the characteristics of strong oxidation ability and low energy consumption convincingly demonstrating its potential as an oxidation anode due to the excellent properties of nanomaterials and nanostructures the preparation of bdd electrodes with various nanostructures has become a research hotspot in recent years for example shi et al 92 etched bdd film on titanium plate by chemical vapor deposition to prepare a bdd electrode with the nano cone array structure see fig 9 a and b compared to the untreated electrode the surface area of the nanostructured electrode increased by 31 the electrochemical oxidation of phenol with the array bdd ti electrode was carried out at the current density of 100 ma cm 2 for 240 min a cod removal efficiency of 63 30 was obtained that was 24 3 higher than that of the untreated electrode showing excellent electrochemical performance mei et al 93 prepared a 3d macroporous bdd electrode with adjustable pore size and interconnection channel see fig 9c and d that was used to oxidize and degrade an active anthraquinone dye rb 19 the 3d porous structure reduces the electron transfer resistance of the bdd ti electrode so that the electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxidation performance in the rb 19 treatment with 100 decolorization and 84 46 mineralization rate achieved in 90 min in addition li et al 94 also used chemical vapor deposition to grow a diamond film on a ta substrate and prepared a bdd electrode with a nano porous structure after etching see fig 9e and f characterization of the electrode showed that the nanostructure increases the effective electroactive surface area of the porous bdd ta electrode and reduces the charge transfer resistance at the liquid solid interface compared to the bdd ta electrode then the porous bdd ta electrode 20 10 0 12 mm was used as the oxidation anode and pt of the same size was used as the cathode to degrade methylene blue mb in combination with the electro fenton process the results show that under the optimum operating conditions the mb in the solution can be degraded by 97 after 80 min treatment indicating that nanostructuring can improve the electrocatalytic performance of bdd in recent years bdd electrodes have been used by researchers to mineralize various types of pops table 3 it can be seen from tabke 3 that bdd anode shows excellent degradation ability for organic pollutants that are difficult to purify by conventional treatment technologies particularly for pops that are difficult to degrade by microorganisms such as antibiotics pesticide residues and environmentally persistent drugs among the existing electrodes currently used in eo the bdd electrode has the highest oxygen evolution overpotential table 4 and has been extensively studied in academic research nb w ta si and other materials are commonly used substrates for bdd electrodes the physical and chemical properties of si are similar to those of diamond so that si substrate bdd electrodes are stable reliable and have long electrode service life however the mechanical strength of the si substrate is poor and it is difficult to prepare a large area electrode in addition according to the research of da silva et al 104 the use of nb as a substrate can reduce energy consumption when compared to the si substrate however these metal substrates are expensive and costly to use many factors hinder the use of bdd electrodes in large scale engineering applications for example the manufacturing process of synthetic diamond based on cvd is still limited to small scale production 49 therefore exploration of cost effective preparation methods and process design of bdd electrodes is still a research hotspot in this field 3 4 sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode magnéli phase sub stoichiometric titanium oxide general formula tino2n 1 was first produced by magnéli in 1959 107 while sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode is a new type of ceramic electrode composed of magnéli phase sub stoichiometric titanium oxide among the tino2n 1 materials ti4o7 and ti5o9 show the best performance and therefore account for a higher proportion in the sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode the sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode with the ti4o7 main component was also registered as the ebonex trademark in the 1990s 52 the magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode has a wide potential window high oxygen evolution overpotential strong corrosion resistance and conductivity of up to 1500 s cm 1 its many advantages and long service life have led to its rapid application to fuel cells lead acid batteries and other fields in recent years researchers have continuously modified and optimized it to explore the application prospects of this electrode for wastewater treatment 108 110 ganiyu et al 111 prepared a magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode by plasma deposition and compared its effectiveness for the degradation of the beta blocker propranolol ppn to the control dsa anode the research results show that under the same conditions compared to the total organic carbon removal rate of the dsa electrode 89 the total organic carbon removal rate of the magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode to ppn was improved and reached 96 corresponding to almost complete mineralization to further prove the potential of the magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode as an oxidation anode they 112 also set up dsa and bdd anodes treated paracetamol pcm with three electrodes under the same conditions and used three supporting electrolytes na2so4 nacl nano3 and naclo4 in the comparative experiments the dsa electrode showed the best removal efficiency in cl medium that was attributed to the fact that dsa anode has been proven to be an effective electrode for the production of active chlorine species 113 however the ti4o7 and bdd anodes showed higher degradation efficiency in so4 2 and clo4 media this can be explained by the high oxygen evolution overpotential of ti4o7 and bdd electrodes that causes them to produce a large amount of physically adsorbed ti4o7 oh and bdd oh the experimental results prove that compared to the dsa electrode and expensive bdd electrode the magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode shows better oxidation ability for pcm degradation in addition wang et al 114 prepared a magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode by high temperature sintering to simultaneously remove antibiotics pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes args in wastewater their study found that at a current density of 10 0 ma cm 2 a variety of pathogens were rapidly inactivated within 15 min and the removal rate of drug resistant genes in wastewater was also in the range of 99 65 99 94 after 3 h of treatment the removal rate of various antibiotics in the wastewater reached more than 90 these studies have provided the initial demonstration of the potential of sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrodes for use as oxidation anodes to further improve the electrochemical performance of the sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrode a variety of methods was used for electrode optimization for example han et al 115 used plasma spraying to prepare an aluminum based oxide anode with ruo2 tio2 sno2 coating and ti4o7 intermediate layer it was found that the aluminum substrate and the ti4o7 intermediate layer are well combined to reduce the resistance of the electrode the doped coating on the surface leads to a highly uniform potential distribution on the electrode surface and improves the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode additionally in this process energy consumption is decreased and the cost of electrolysis is reduced compared to that using the ti ruo2 tio2 electrode lin et al 116 used high temperature sintering to prepare a magnéli phase ti4o7 electrode with extensive interconnecting macropores and used it for the electrochemical oxidation treatment of the environmentally persistent poly and perfluoroalkyl substances pfass their results show that the porous structure provides a large number of active sites for the oxidation of the substances on the electrode surface greatly improving the efficiency of electrochemical oxidation only trace amounts of perfluorocarboxylic acid pfcas with shortened chain lengths were observed as intermediates during pfoa mineralization after the treatment was completed no organofluorine compounds such as shorter chain pfcas were detected in the solution by high resolution mass spectrometry hrms it is believed that the electrode material will be used for the removal of fluorine containing substances in wastewater wang et al 117 prepared three types of magnéli phase anodes ti ti4o7 ti ti4o7 pbo2 ce ti ti4o7 nanotube arrays nta and through further characterization of the three electrodes found that all three anodes have very high oxygen evolution potentials 2 16 2 44 v vs sce their research showed that in the degradation of organic matter the highly ordered tubular structure of ti ti4o7 nta gives it the largest surface area that is conducive to the adsorption of organic matter endowing this electrode with the strongest degradation ability the ti ti4o7 pbo2 ce electrode showed the smallest surface area and therefore ti ti4o7 and ti ti4o7 nta displayed better performance than ti ti4o7 pbo2 ce with the phosphorus removal rate reaching 89 92 this removal rate is slightly lower than that of the bdd electrode 95 but the degradation ability of these three electrodes is still stronger than those of other electrodes such as ti pt and ti ruo2 iro2 thus sub stoichiometric titanium oxide electrodes are considered to be highly promising and cost effective electrode materials for wastewater treatment with optimized ti ti4o7 and ti ti4o7 nta showing particularly promising performance 4 electrochemical reactor eo technology research has long been focused on the optimization of electrode materials and structures however in the electrochemical system the design and manufacture of highly efficient and reasonable electrochemical reactors is also an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of electrochemical oxidation reducing the cost of electrochemical treatment and improving the feasibility of the practical sue of electrochemical devices 4 1 two dimensional electrochemical reactor in the design and manufacturing of traditional two dimensional electrochemical reactors the main consideration is to further improve the efficiency of electrochemical treatment by improving mass transfer conditions in the related research work basha et al 118 used the ti ruox tiox electrode as the oxidation anode and stainless steel plate as the cathode for the eo treatment of special chemical industrial wastewaters containing number of refractory organic pollutants and intense chroma they did not conduct a detailed study of the electrode or the operating conditions but rather focused on the structure of the reactor and compared the performance of batch batch recirculation and continuous recycle reactors in the electrochemical oxidation of wastewater it was found that continuous recycle reactors can control the transfer coefficient and processing time through the circulation flow rate and the extraction flow rate the operation of these reactors is convenient and the circulation process also greatly improves the mass transfer efficiency therefore continuous recycle reactor is considered to be the best reactor structure in another study basha et al 119 used tiox ruox anodes under different operating conditions to compare the performance of the three reactors in the treatment of textile dye wastewater from the perspective of power consumption the experimental results showed that under the same treatment time the batch recirculation reactor has the best treatment effect and its energy consumption is relatively low after 6 h of operation flow rate of 100 l h 1 current density of 5 0 a dm 2 the rate of the removal of the cod in wastewater was 91 38 and the specific energy consumption was 83 8 kwh kg cod 1 generally the use of a circulation system greatly improves the mass transfer efficiency and processing efficiency 4 2 three dimensional electrochemical reactor two dimensional electrode reactors have shortcomings such as small specific surface area and low current efficiency to address these problems bickhurst et al 120 proposed the concept of three dimensional electrodes in the 1960s that are constructed by filling the traditional two dimensional electrodes with granular or detrital granular materials such as activated carbon and metal particles 121 under the action of an external electric field many micro electrochemical systems and electrochemical reactions will occur on the surface of the filler particles fig 10 that act as the third pole also known as the particle electrode 122 the filling of particle electrodes optimizes the mass transfer efficiency of the pollutants between the electrodes increases the specific surface area and effectively improves the current efficiency endowing this electrode with great application potential in the field of wastewater treatment 123 to date this approach has been used in the treatment of landfill leachate 124 pharmaceutical wastewater 125 126 dye wastewater 127 heavy metal ions 128 phenols 129 amines 130 and other wastewater and various pops in another study zhang et al 131 used ti sn ce bamboo biochar as a filler to prepare a three dimensional electrode and investigated the electrode s ability to treat coking wastewater the results showed that under the conditions of the electrolysis time of 150 min and current density of 30 ma m 2 the removal rates of chemical oxygen and organic carbon in coking wastewater reached 92 91 and 74 66 respectively in this study the addition of ti sn ce significantly improved the electro oxidation electro adsorption and electro catalysis performance of the carbon particle electrode effectively converting macromolecular toxic substances into low toxicity organic substances and improving the biochemical treatment of wastewater sun et al 132 prepared a ti sn sb γ al2o3 particle electrode to oxidatively degrade oxytetracycline otc during the electrochemical oxidation process large amounts of tio2 sno2 and sb2o3 were formed on the surface of the particle electrode these oxides are dispersed in the gap and surface of the particle electrode as spherical and rod shaped crystals significantly improving the electrocatalytic performance of the electrode under the optimal operating conditions the otc and toc removal rates reached 91 9 and 41 4 respectively chi et al 133 synthesized bentonite lignin nano zero valent iron bl nzvi with organic solvent lignin as the stabilizer bl nzvi was applied as a particle electrode and formed a three dimensional electrode system with ruthenium iridium coated titanium plates to treat pops such as tannin resin acid and chlorinated organic matter in papermaking wastewater experimental results showed that organic solvent lignin can effectively prevent the aggregation of zero valent iron nanoparticles under the best operating conditions the three dimensional electrode system has excellent performance in cod degradation and decolorization demonstrating that the three dimensional electrode is a highly promising technology in the field of wastewater treatment 5 electrocatalyst the modification of electrode materials and the optimization of electrochemical reactors are the main research directions of eo technology in addition to these two improvement methods some researchers used the method of adding electrocatalysts to the solution to obtained improved eo performance 5 1 basic mechanism fenton oxidation is a highly effective advanced oxidation process for the removal of pops from water it uses the reaction between h2o2 and a fenton reagent i e fe2 cu mn2 and other sub metallic salts to catalyze the formation of oh and then oxidize various organic substances into inorganic substances in the classic fenton reaction eq 13 hydrogen peroxide was catalytically decomposed by ferrous ion under acidic condition normally ph 3 to generate hydroxyl radicals oh 137 13 h 2 o 2 fe 2 fe 3 oh oh the fenton process has the advantages of high treatment efficiency and simple operation but also has significant disadvantages such as high h2o2 consumption difficult regeneration after low charge ions are transformed into high charge ions and secondary pollution caused by metal sludge 138 139 in a broad sense in addition to fenton process other processes that produce oh through h2o2 for treatment of organic matter can be collectively referred to as fenton like process 140 141 following this approach by adding metal salts such as h2o2 and fe2 fe3 to the electrolytic cell fe3 can be continuously converted to fe2 through cathode reduction eq 14 that is to realize the mn m n 1 redox cycle if bimetallic particles are loaded one metal redox cycle can also be excited by the other 14 fe 3 e fe 2 in addition the advanced oxidation process based on sulfate radical so4 has attracted increasing attention so4 has a high standard redox potential e 2 6 v she 142 similar to classic fenton s reaction sulfate radicals can be generated by activating peroxymonosulfate pms or oxone hso5 or peroxydisulfate pds s2o8 2 with transition metals eqs 15 and 16 and the process is also accompanied by the production of oh and superoxide radicals o2 143 15 s 2 o 8 2 m n m n 1 so 4 2 so 4 16 hs o 5 m n m n 1 oh so 4 through this method the combination of a fenton like process and eo process can strengthen the indirect oxidation capacity of the eo process so as to improve the treatment efficiency of pops in water because the supported catalyst can be easily separated from the product after the recovery of the catalyst by filtration and centrifugation the loss of catalytic activity is small and the separation amount of the load is small therefore in the eo fenton like process to prevent the generation of metal sludge natural zeolite alumina mesoporous molecular sieve and other substrates can be used to load metal particles or metal oxides to prepare single metal or even bimetallic catalysts in particular mesoporous molecular sieves acting as heterogeneous catalysts such as mcm 41 mcm 48 sba 15 and other silicon based materials have unique physical and chemical properties for example the highly ordered mesoporous structure provides a rapid diffusion channel for the reactant and product molecules the large pore volume and high surface area can carry more active sites and disperse the active sites well the abundant silanol groups enable easy modification of the surface properties and the flexible skeleton allows the metal active sites to be easily incorporated into silica materials 144 145 these excellent properties have led to many reports on the application of these materials in the fields of drug delivery 146 catalysis 147 heavy metal 148 149 and organic adsorption 150 151 and also demonstrated that mesoporous molecular sieves have broad prospects in the field of supported electrocatalysts 5 2 electrocatalyst synthesis and characterization 5 2 1 synthesis of electrocatalyst support mcm 41 is the most representative ordered mesoporous silica material in the m41s family its name comes from mobil oil corporation that proposed the liquid crystal template mechanism in 1992 that is mcm 41 was synthesized by using long chain cationic quaternary ammonium salt surfactant as the template 152 as shown in fig 11 a c 153 the m41s family can be divided into two dimensional hexagonal structure mcm 41 cubic structure mcm 48 and unstable layer materials mcm 50 according to different crystal structures 154 among these mcm 41 is the most studied type because other members of the m41s family are difficult to synthesize and have poor thermal stability as shown in fig 11d sba 15 in the santa barbara amorphous family sba is another mesoporous silica that is often reported in the literature the crystal structure is an ordered two dimensional hexagonal phase and the pore walls have many micropores it was successfully prepared by zhao et al 155 using hydrophilic triblock copolymer p123 as the template and tetraethyl orthosilicate as the silicon source as shown in fig 12 156 the synthesis strategy for obtaining these mesoporous silica whether m41s or sba is based on supramolecular self assembly of surfactants the more common method is hydrothermal synthesis 157 that is the template and silica precursor such as tetraethyl orthosilicate 158 or sodium metasilicate 159 are subjected to hydrothermal treatment and then the surfactant is removed by high temperature calcination to obtain the target product in addition methods such as the sol micelle method ultrasonic method and microwave synthesis method can also be used to obtain mesoporous silica 160 161 when the synthesized mesoporous silica is used as a catalyst it may lose its activity due to coke deposition to the organic matter covering the active center or blocking the pore channel and the change of catalyst structure caused by some reaction conditions therefore control of the synthesis conditions during the synthesis process is important for the preparation of a catalyst with high activity and high stability 162 163 in these synthesis operations the nature of the surfactant has the greatest influence on the structure of mesoporous silica under the same conditions a longer carbon chain of the surfactant results in larger pore size of the obtained mesoporous silica 164 in addition ph hydrothermal treatment time temperature change and other conditions will endow the silica with different pore characteristics and particle morphologies 165 166 for example ctab surfactant can produce highly ordered hexagonal pores in mesoporous silica if self assembly is carried out under strong alkaline conditions while self assembly under strong acidic conditions will lead to the formation of cubic mesopores 167 in another example mcm 41 materials are often synthesized under alkaline conditions ph 9 12 168 better silane alcohol condensation can occur in mesoporous silica obtained under alkaline conditions since the equipotential of silicon is found at ph 2 the synthesis of sba 15 must be carried out under strong acidic conditions the lower medium ph allows sba 15 material to obtain a highly ordered structure and thick pore walls and when metal ions are loaded an appropriate increase in the ph of the medium can increase the metal loading rate 169 these mesoporous silica materials are both nanostructures and nanoparticles they have a large adjustable pore size particularly sba 15 compared to other pore materials the thicker pore wall 3 6 nm endows them with good thermal stability hydrothermal stability and hydrolytic stability 170 171 165 the special structure and excellent characteristics make it a potential catalyst carrier in electrocatalysis 5 2 2 functionalization and characterization the functional modification of mesoporous silica is achieved by the reaction of the siloxane si o si and silanol si oh functional groups on the surface of the mesoporous matrix with specific molecules in particular the reaction of silanol groups direct reaction with hydroxyl is considered to be the main approach for modification fig 13 illustrates the two mechanisms of surface modification of mcm 41 mesoporous materials namely the co condensation method and the post synthesis method 153 the co condensation method also known as one pot synthetic method was first proposed by mann 172 in this method the functional agent was directly added into the synthesis system and co assembled with the amphiphilic surfactant template under certain reaction conditions to obtain the modified mesoporous materials this method has short preparation time but limits the concentration of modifier on the substrate surface 173 174 in the post synthesis method the mesoporous silica is modified after synthesis for functionalization using methods such as impregnation grafting and ion exchange 175 because the impregnation method is simple and easy to operate and can retain the ordered pore structure of the original molecular sieve to the greatest extent this method is often used to anchor the metal particles on the mesoporous support for example li et al 176 first synthesized mcm 41 by the hydrothermal method and then successfully prepared the mn xal mcm 41 catalyst by using the immersion method to anchor al and mn on the substrate fasanya et al 177 prepared cu zn mcm 41 catalysts by one pot synthesis and impregnation synthesis respectively it was found that the catalyst synthesized by impregnation method has the highest catalytic activity for methanol similar to mesoporous supports the successfully prepared electrocatalyst can be characterized by different techniques such as transmission electron microscopy tem scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd n2 adsorption desorption and fourier transform mid infrared spectroscopy ftir as shown in fig 14 a c gheno et al 178 used sem and tem to characterize sba 15 and al sba 15 through sem we can visually observe the microstructure of the catalyst and it can be seen that the introduction of al led to a reduction in the size of primary particles and an increase in particle irregularities tem can provide high resolution particle morphology information and the tem image presented in fig 14c clearly shows the highly ordered porous structure of the sba 15 carrier as shown in fig 15 a 179 the characteristic peaks of the low angle diffraction pattern at 100 110 200 show the characteristics of mesoporous materials with an ordered hexagonal close packed support structure sba 15 however the peak strength is significantly reduced after metal loading indicating that the long range order of the porosity of the hexagonal arrangement is reduced 180 the wide angle diffraction pattern in fig 15b proves that the metal elements are highly dispersed on the mesoporous support but the loading is low 181 in addition it was concluded that the small difference between the obtained ftir spectra fig 15c implies that the metal loading of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts prepared by the impregnation method is low resulting in little effect of the metal anchoring on the surface properties of sba 15 additionally the ftir spectrum also shows some typical absorption bands that can be used for sba 15 characterization for example the absorption bands at 799 and 1087 cm 1 can be attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of si o si 182 183 the surface area pore size and volume of mesoporous materials are determined by studying n2 adsorption desorption isotherms differences in the pore size and pore structure will cause the isotherms to follow different adsorption and desorption paths according to the iupac classification adsorption isotherms can be divided into six types among which type iv isotherms are suitable for mesoporous adsorbents such as mcm 41 and sba 15 184 as shown in fig 15d the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions of sba 15 and co mn sba 15 were obtained it is observed that co mn sba 15 and sba 15 have similar isotherms which means that the mesoporous structure is hardly affected by metal loading their specific surface area and pore volume can be calculated by the bet and bjh methods and the calculation results show that co mn sba 15 displayed significantly lower bet surface area and total pore volume than the parent sba 15 due to the deposition of the co and mn oxide clusters 5 3 related research in previous literature reports following the synthesis of catalysts such as sba 15 or mcm 41 researchers often use catalyst h2o2 or catalyst pms pds to oxidize and degrade the target pops with a separate fenton like process for example to degrade n n dimethyl p phenyl diamine dpd karthikeyan et al 185 synthesized sba 15 by the hydrothermal method and then successfully loaded cu and fe on sba 15 by impregnation to prepare the cu fe sba 15 fe sba 15 and cu sba 15 metal catalysts during the experiment a certain amount of catalyst and h2o2 were added to the target solution containing dpd the results showed that the catalytic performance of the bimetallic catalyst was the best with a dpd removal efficiency of 83 sun et al 186 prepared the fe co mcm 41 bimetallic catalyst fig 16 a by the one pot hydrothermal method and efficiently degraded methyl orange by activating pms the experimental results show that mo can be degraded by 95 7 in 60 min after treatment with fe co mcm 41 pms system which is higher than that of the fe mcm 41 pms system 80 6 the excellent catalytic activity of fe co mcm 41 was attributed to the high metal dispersion and the synergistic effect of the co2 co3 and fe2 fe3 redox cycles to degrade the fluorescent rhodamine b rhb dye xu et al 179 successfully synthesized sba 15 using p123 as the template and sodium metasilicate as the silicon source and co and mn were loaded on sba 15 by impregnation to prepare the co mn sba 15 bimetallic catalyst under mild conditions co mn sba 15 and pms were added to the target solution containing rhb to achieve up to 99 rhb removal within 45 min as shown in fig 16b the possible mechanism of pms activation by co mn sba 15 was proposed this mechanism is similar to the mechanism proposed by su et al 186 in both studies it was concluded that singlet oxygen 1o2 produced during pms decomposition plays a major role in rhb degradation in addition to the oxidative degradation of target pops by a fenton like reaction only the fenton like process can also be combined with visible light and ultraviolet light illumination ultrasonication and other techniques for example wang et al 187 synthesized cds sba 15 catalyst to degrade salicylic acid under visible light irradiation the results showed that under the synergistic action of visible light and cds sba 15 catalyst the degradation efficiency of salicylic acid reached 84 93 within 6 h lima et al 188 successfully loaded fe3o4 and wo3 on sba 15 support to prepare the fe3o4 wo3 sba 15 catalyst after the catalyst was added to the target solution the herbicide acid dichlorophenoxyacetic 2 4 d was photodegraded under ultraviolet irradiation and the results showed that the fe3o4 wo3 sba 15 catalyst promoted 90 73 of 2 4 d degradation within 4 h cai et al 189 prepared a co sba 15 catalyst and degraded acid orange 7 ao7 in the co sba 15 pms us process with the assistance of ultrasonication us the experimental results show that the removal rate of ao7 in the co sba 15 pms us process can reach 95 9 within 90 min under the same operating conditions which is much higher than the removal rate of the co sba 15 pms process only 67 1 additionally co sba 15 particles can be used repeatedly with excellent durability at the same time they 190 also prepared fe co sba 15 catalyst combined with ultrasonication to enhance the activation of sulfate for the degradation of orange ii in water in the 2 h reaction process the decolorization efficiency of fe co sba 15 pms us process for orange ii was 95 5 which was much higher than that of the fe co sba 15 pms process 25 2 indicating that there was a synergistic effect between us and the catalyst and us could significantly enhance the catalytic activity of the catalyst fig 17 a and b show the possible degradation mechanisms of the co sba 15 pms us and fe co sba 15 pms us systems respectively among a variety of technologies used in conjunction with fenton like processes eo technology is anticipated to be the most effective by adding catalyst pms pds to the electric reaction device efficient degradation of pops can be achieved by the eo fenton like process for example to eliminate the environmentally persistent azo dye orange ii cai et al 162 loaded fe and co on sba 15 to prepare the fe co sba 15 bimetallic catalyst and then used the eo fenton like process to degrade methyl orange ii in solution in the electrolysis device a dsa electrode φ 5 11 9 cm was used as anode and plate shaped stainless steel of the same size was used as the cathode and the reaction begins after the fe co sba 15 catalyst and pds are added to the reactor a series of characterizations showed that fe and co are well supported on sba 15 and the leaching rate of the metal particles in the bimetallic catalyst is lower than that of the single metal catalyst showing higher stability the decolorization rate of orange ii in the solution was determined to show the treatment effect of the process the results showed that within 60 min the decolorization rate of 89 4 was achieved by electrochemical treatment alone while the decolorization rate of 95 6 was achieved by the eo fe co sba 15 pds process the decolorization effect was significant indicating that the combination of the eo technology and fe co sba 15 pds process had a synergistic effect on the decolorization of orange ii in another study liu et al 163 prepared a mncu bimetallic oxide catalyst mn cu al mcm 41 supported on aluminum containing mcm 41 by the coprecipitation method in order to study the degradation of humic acid ha by the electro fenton chlorine process see fig 18 a the electrolysis device uses a platinum electrode with a size of φ 0 5 37 mm as the anode and a carbon felt cf with the dimensions of 40 50 5 mm as the cathode a quantity of catalyst and a fixed concentration of cacl2 and nacl were added to the electrolysis cup and the degradation experiment was performed under a given current density of 3 5 ma cm 2 fig 18a shows the degradation mechanism of ha it can be seen that a large amount of mn3 and cu are present on the surface of the mcm 41 catalyst and these ions promote the decomposition of h2o2 to oh moreover since the standard reduction potential of cu cu2 0 195 v is lower than mn3 mn4 0 95 v mn4 is reduced to mn3 by cu on the catalyst surface mn4 can also obtain electrons on the catalyst surface to generate mn3 and the continuous redox cycle of mn3 greatly improves the degradation ability of the process in addition since nacl and cacl2 are added to the solution the cl concentration also becomes an influencing factor for ha degradation in this system the experiments at different concentration of salinity were conducted and it was found that a cod degradation efficiency of approximately 90 can be obtained at a lower salinity range of 500 1000 mg l 1 but the degradation efficiency decreased greatly with increasing salinity this is because a higher concentration of chloride ions will be oxidized at the anode to produce more chlorine that will be completely transformed into hclo under the experimental condition of ph 6 and hclo will consume more cu mn3 and h2o2 resulting in a decrease in the oh output eqs 17 18 191 moreover cl will also consume the generated oh eq 19 184 which will inhibit the degradation of cod therefore for both a separate eo process and a combined process it is necessary to control the salinity within an appropriate range to improve the degradation efficiency 17 hclo cu mn 3 h e cu 2 mn 4 cl h 2 o 18 hclo h 2 o 2 3 h 4 e 2 cl 3 h 2 o 19 cl oh hcl o in other studies lin et al 192 used an eo fenton like process to degrade environmentally persistent clofibric acid cfa they loaded fe and cu on sba 15 support the total metal loading was 5 wt and the sample was named tm1 tm2 sba and prepared the fe cu sba 15 bimetallic catalyst the experiment was carried out in a 250 ml glass beaker using a dsa φ 5 11 9 cm anode and ti cathode with the initial ph set to 3 and the catalyst and pds added to the cfa solution under magnetic stirring fig 18b shows a schematic diagram of the cfa degradation process the cfa degradation pathways in this process can be divided into electrochemical direct oxidation and indirect oxidation of oh and so4 radicals and epr analysis shows that oh plays a major role in the degradation at the same time the experimental results showed that after 60 min of treatment cfa was completely removed under the synergistic effect of eo and fe cu sba 15 pds the degradation efficiency was much higher than the degradation efficiency 66 2 when the eo process was used alone and was also higher than the degradation efficiency of the 5cu sba 83 4 and 5fe sba 99 7 single metal catalysts it can be seen from the degradation efficiency of cfa that the eo fenton like process is an effective process for oxidative degradation of pops in water particularly when bimetallic catalysts are used although there have been few reports in the literature on the eo fenton process in recent years the above literature survey shows that this process has good prospects in the field of pops processing and other emerging technologies can be explored to enhance the pops processing ability of the eo process at the same time the above studies also show that reasonable electrode material modification and reactor design as well as the addition of high performance electrocatalysts can achieve efficient wastewater treatment whereas many researchers have found that the use of eo technology alone for the complete mineralization of high concentration persistent organic wastewater incurs high energy consumption and is not economically feasible therefore the combination of eo technology and other processes is currently a research hotspot and is also the basis for the application of the eo technology in practical industrial use 6 combination of eo and other water treatment processes the development of eo technology is no longer limited to the treatment of simulated wastewater in the laboratory and has now been applied to the practical treatment of various types of wastewaters however its large scale application is still limited by high energy consumption unlike for academic research that focuses on obtaining high efficiency of pollutant removal the cost of long term operation must be considered in the practical treatment of industrial wastewater therefore the combination of eo technology and other water treatment technologies as illustrated in fig 19 makes eo technology suitable for use in the pretreatment or post treatment steps of wastewater treatment process or for use as a part of an integrated one step treatment involving other technologies the combination of eo and other technologies is an effective strategy for the enabling the wider use of the eo technology in practical applications 6 1 pretreatment anaerobic aerobic biological treatment is a relatively mature water treatment technology that has been widely used in the field of wastewater treatment it is based on the use of the biological activities of microorganisms to treat organic wastewater however this approach is ineffective for the treatment of the wastewater with pollutants that have high biological toxicity such as antibiotics and pesticides by contrast electrochemical oxidation technology can be used for the pretreatment of such wastewater in order to improve its biodegradability in one example of this approach santhanam et al 193 used a combination of eo light induced degradation slip and biological treatment to treat structurally stable and difficult to biodegrade heterocyclic aromatic compounds in textile wastewater they used the ruo2 tio2 ti expanded network as the anode and the ti expanded network as the cathode and performed continuous electrochemical oxidation for 40 min the results showed that the auxiliaries and dyes in the textile wastewater are oxidized to aromatic intermediates improving the biodegradability of the wastewater but this process is also accompanied by the production of active chlorine that affects the subsequent biological treatment therefore a sunlight induced degradation step is added between the electrochemical oxidation and biological treatment the increase of this step can reduce active chlorine substances in the absence of photolysis the overall treatment efficiency was 22 and reached 71 after photolysis in another study fudala ksiazek et al 194 used bdd electrodes with different boron doping concentrations as oxidation anodes to pretreat landfill leachate containing a large amount of ammonia nitrogen and various organic substances in the experiment the refractory bisphenol a in the waste liquid was used as an indicator to measure the degradation efficiency the study found that after 8 h of eo treatment all organic matter in the waste liquid was completely mineralized no intermediate products were produced and the final waste liquid only contained a large amount of ammonia that can easily reach the emission target after the subsequent biological treatment to date many researchers have studied the feasibility of eo technology for the pretreatment of various types of wastewaters for example trellu et al 195 used a process coupled with eo technology and aerobic biological treatment to remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in contaminated soil in this process the removal of cod accorded with the first order kinetic model and the comparative experiment was carried out after the optimal reaction conditions were determined the results show that a cod removal rate of 71 can be obtained by eo treatment alone for 5 h and the power consumption is high reaching 67 kwh kg cod 1 however after a short period of eo pretreatment followed by biodegradation the energy consumption is greatly reduced to approximately 30 kwh kg cod 1 and the removal rate of cod increased to reach 80 this result shows that the combined process is an effective approach for improving the treatment efficiency and reducing the treatment cost to improve the biodegradability of soil washing wastewater carboneras et al 196 used four anode materials ir mmo ru mmo psi bbd cf to electrochemically oxidize the wastewater their results showed that for low current charge the toxicity of wastewater increases and the biodegradability decreases but when the current charge exceeds 2 5a h dm 3 the toxicity is significantly reduced and the bod5 cod ratio increases from 0 02 to 0 23 xu et al 197 used two sets of samples where the first group of samples used eo technology to pretreat the waste activated sludge was for 60 min followed by anaerobic biological treatment for 9 d and the no pretreatment was performed for the second group used as a control group after 8 d of pretreatment the contents of total dissolved phosphorus orthophosphate and organic phosphorus in the waste liquid were respectively 5 3 9 2 and 2 7 times lower than those of the control group and the soluble chemical oxygen demand was also far higher than that of the control group analysis showed that electrochemical pretreatment promotes sludge decomposition resulting in the release of phosphorus and organic matter that is beneficial for the subsequent anaerobic treatment the cost of this process was also analyzed and the results showed that although the treatment cost of the combined process 2 00 t was was slightly higher than that of the traditional anaerobic process 1 80 t was the economic value of the fertilizer collected by the combined process 0 83 t was was much higher than that of the single process 0 23 t was economic evaluation shows that the combined process has positive economic value for the recovery of phosphorus from was and it also provides a new approach for the recovery of phosphorus from sludge similarly pęziak kowalska et al 198 used a combined process of eo and biological treatment for the degradation of herbicidal ionic liquids hils after 3 h of the electrochemical treatment of hils continuous biological treatment was carried out studies have shown that the wastewater mineralization rate after the combined process treatment can reach up to 57 far exceeding the rate 8 obtained for the control sample without electrochemical pretreatment thus electrochemical oxidation increased the mineralization rate of hils proving the reliability of eo pretreatment 6 2 post processing when eo technology is used as a post treatment step for wastewater it is often used to degrade inorganic particles or pops in the treatment of distiller grain wastewater the effluent will contain some refractory organics and biological activity inhibitors because biological treatment cannot achieve complete mineralization therefore vilar et al 199 used eo technology to post treat the effluent in the case of biological optimization treatment after eo treatment the final waste liquid color removal rate reaches 100 the cod removal rate is 66 and the toc removal rate is 61 the researchers used the waste liquid after the treatment to water the crops and found that the toxicity of the waste liquid was completely removed with zero lethality for the crops in other studies soriano et al 200 designed an enhanced treatment method combining membrane separation and eo technology to address the difficulties in the removal of perfluoroalkyl acid in the early stage of treatment nanofiltration membrane nf90 and reverse osmosis membrane bw30 were used to capture and concentrate perfluoroalkyl acid in the water and then eo technology was used to oxidize the concentrate after treatment the concentration of perfluoroalkyl acid in the effluent was less than 70 ng l 1 reaching the drinking water standard cost analysis of this process showed that the preconcentration method can significantly improve the conductivity of the electrolyte reduce the energy consumption of electrolysis and obtain the lowest total cost 13 1 m 3 when applying higher current similarly using four drugs in the wastewater as treatment indicators ouarda et al 201 used a combination of membrane bioreactor and eo technology to treat hospital wastewater and compared the treatment effects of the eo technology used in the pretreatment and post treatment steps the results showed that the optimal performance was obtained when a membrane bioreactor is used to treat the wastewater first and then the eo technology is used for post treatment the removal rate of the four types of drugs in the wastewater reached 97 which is higher than the treatment effect 90 when the eo technology is used in the pretreatment step 6 3 integrated processing in addition to using eo technology in the pre treatment and post treatment steps an integrated treatment process without a specific sequence can be used to form a system for wastewater treatment through a combination of multiple water treatment processes for example cui et al 202 designed an eo upflow biological aerated filter electrodialysis integrated system for the removal of triazole fungicides from wastewater the results showed that the cod level of the effluent was only 58 32 mg l 1 the toc level was 20 56 mg l 1 the removal rate of nitrogen heterocyclic pollutants was over 90 and the removal rate of salt pollutants was 99 fully demonstrating the excellent treatment efficiency of the system compared to other reported methods it was found that the treatment cost of the eo upflow biological aerated filter electrodialysis integrated system is lower 0 78 t and is also lower than the local industrial wastewater price 0 92 t this provides a preliminary proof of the application value of the integrated system in the treatment of triazole fungicide wastewater in addition the complex composition of wastewater produced by the petrochemical industry and food processing industry that contains a variety of difficult to biodegradable substances and heavy metal ions poses difficulties for treatment with general treatment technologies therefore lee et al 203 developed the dissolved air flotation eo magnetic biochar integrated system to treat suspended solids complex organics and heavy metals in wastewater respectively finally 99 7 of oil 95 of cod and more than 90 of metals in the wastewater were removed including copper arsenic lead and other heavy metal ions that were adsorbed by magnetic biochar and effectively recovered in other studies li et al 204 designed an electro flocculation carbon membrane coupled eo integrated system for the removal of oily substances in petrochemical and food industry wastewater the oily wastewater first passes through the electro flocculation device in this step most of the oil forms flocs are removed and the remaining small part of the oil flows through the tubular carbon membrane to the electrochemical oxidation device the tubular carbon membrane can not only separate oil droplets but also can be used as an oxidation anode most of the oil droplets are completely mineralized in the electrochemical oxidation device and the final oil content of the effluent is below 30 mg l 1 demonstrating that the device has excellent oil removal performance in the integrated system the combined technology of ultrasonic assist and electrochemical oxidation is also an attractive process for example dietrich et al 205 used ultrasound assisted electrochemical oxidation technology to degrade bisphenol a bpa experimental results show that when the initial concentration is 1 mg l 1 the combined system can remove more than 90 of bpa within 30 min the reaction follows pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0 089 min 1 which is consistent with the results of xu et al 206 ren et al 207 also used ultrasound assisted electrochemical technology to degrade phenol under optimal operating conditions phenol can be completely removed within 1 h which is far more effective than a single process ultrasound 16 electrochemistry 32 in the ultrasonic assisted electrochemical oxidation technology in addition to using the cavitation effect to degrade organic pollutants 208 ultrasound can also cooperate with the electrochemical oxidation technology to increase the mass transfer rate and chemical reaction rate to increase the degree of mineralization and reduce electrode passivation and scaling problem it can be seen that this technology has excellent prospects in the field of persistent organic pollutants treatment 209 210 some research examples of eo technology combined with other water treatment technologies in recent years are listed in table 5 it was found that the combined technology can treat all kinds of pops that are difficult to completely purify using a single process and result in great improvement of the treatment efficiency therefore a key direction of eo technology research in the future is to develop combinations of eo with various water treatment processes overcome the shortcomings of high energy consumption of eo technology and realize the efficient treatment of large volumes of industrial wastewater or decentralized and domestic wastewater with lower cost and shorter time by constructing simple and easy to operate treatment devices 7 conclusions and prospects after years of development electrochemical oxidation has become the most promising wastewater treatment technology it has shown excellent performance and for both the mineralization treatment for pops and the detoxification treatment of highly biologically toxic organics and has been widely recognized as a leading technology in the field of wastewater treatment to date eo technology has been applied in actual wastewater treatment to some extent but i most investigations are still in the laboratory stage and lack practical applications ii in addition most of the wastewater used in the experiment is a single component wastewater configured in the laboratory but the actual wastewater often has complex and varied composition and is influenced by multiple factors unfortunately research in this area has been insufficient iii electrode materials play the key role in eo technology so that future research will focus on the research and development of new electrode materials the design of excellent electrode structure and the optimization of efficient electrode preparation process iv the elucidation of the mechanism of the oxidation of organic matter in eo technology is of fundamental importance for improving the efficiency of the electrochemical system to degrade organic matter and will also provide the basis for the implementation of these systems in industrial use therefore it is necessary to further elucidate the modification mechanism and oxidation mechanism of electrode materials v the rational design of an efficient mass transfer reactor is vital for improving the efficiency of electrochemical oxidation vii the excellent structural characteristics of mesoporous materials such as sba 15 and mcm 41 are not only beneficial for the synthesis of efficient electrocatalysts but also enable a new approach for the synthesis of novel electrocatalyst materials however the application of molecular sieves still has many shortcomings such as the insufficient stability and hydrothermal stability of the heteroatom loaded molecular sieves and the high cost of the template agent to obtain greater application value further improvements are necessary vii in addition the combination of eo technology with biological treatment adsorption filtration membrane and other treatment processes in a high efficiency integrated system to reduce the treatment cost and improve the biochemical and treatment efficiency of refractory organic matter is also the hot spot of cutting edge eo development most of the literature reports cited in this review focus on basic research performed in the laboratory whereas there have been few reports on the scale up of laboratory devices and industrial field experiments therefore for greater application of eo technology to industry practice the actual on site conditions should be simulated and a special pilot study should be carried out to determine the actual limitations on site and verify the feasibility of laboratory process after scale up all of the above problems require in depth investigations to obtain significant breakthroughs and enable the wide use of eo technology for wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgments this work

13239,pharmaceuticals are found in aquatic environments around the world their presence is dangerous to humans and animals so it is imperative to remove these substances from the water as part of this work a composite material was developed to remove pharmacological compounds contained in water which was confirmed by the adsorption analysis of sulfadiazine amoxicillin and tetracycline initial studies of pure polymeric materials were carried out to determine their properties graphene oxide was selected as the adsorbent due to its adsorption and antibacterial properties the experiments were carried out in a static system with the use of uv vis spectrophotometry the article contains the results determining the effectiveness of the material and considerations on the adsorption mechanism isothermal and kinetic models the fit of the experimental data to the henry langmuir freundlich toth and redlich peterson isotherms was checked models of pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetics are considered the developed material turned out to be suitable for adsorption of all analyzed substances graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption composite material graphene oxide pharmaceuticals 1 introduction pharmacological substances belong to a group of compounds known as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps medicines antibiotics hormones and cosmetics belong to this group as well these substances even in small doses affect the human health 1 pharmacological substances end up in the aquatic environment as a result of their excretion in a non metabolized form their main sources are hospitals households farms and especially inefficient wastewater plants 2 4 it is health threatening due to the high toxicity of pharmaceuticals metabolites and their transformation products likewise it is dangerous because pharmaceuticals constantly accumulate and are released into the environment that is why they have been defined as pseudo persistent 5 6 conventional water treatment technologies do not ensure a complete removal of pharmaceuticals 7 10 biological methods aerobic and anaerobic oxidation adsorption and membrane techniques nf ro membrane distillation have been used in order to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater 11 due to pharmaceuticals varied structure pharmacological substances are present in the purified sewage stream that is why improvement of the efficiency of wastewater treatment technology is necessary the solution to these problems may be the use of composite materials as a result of combining several different materials one obtains a new material with different parameters e g with adsorption properties or greater thermal stability during the last ten years the number of publications connected with composite material and wastewater treatment has increased almost ten times data after scopus many studies consider preparing composite materials by mixing carbon nanotubes graphene or graphene oxide with polymers to remove organic compounds or heavy metal ions from the effluent 12 17 the use of the adsorbent in the form of a composite material has such an advantage over the adsorbent in the form of a suspension that the problem of separating the suspension from the water is eliminated 18 the authors proposed the development of composite material that absorbs pharmaceuticals from the aquatic environment the next step in this technology development is to apply this material onto the micro or ultrafiltration membrane such a membrane will be multifunctional because of its filtration and adsorption properties 19 due to the fact that the composite needs to adhere to the membrane it must have appropriate mechanical properties not only adsorption ones the aim of this paper is to develop a composite material and analyze an adsorption process of pharmacological substances onto the material using isotherms of adsorption and kinetics models chosen polymers characterize easy processing high stability in the aquatic environment and high availability the main adsorbent go is extremely hydrophilic carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxy groups are present in the structure of the go which makes it a good adsorbent go is used to adsorb a lot of substances for example dyes metal ions and gases 20 24 the effectiveness of go is possible because of varied interactions between go and the substances the type of the interaction depends on the substance s structure one could distinguish electrostatic hydrophobic and π π interactions as well as h bonding 25 27 the presence of functional groups on the go s surface causes oxidative stress of microorganisms which negatively affects their development which ensures go antibacterial properties 28 29 according to the literature different adsorbents have various values of maximum capacity that described the maximum amount of the substance that could be adsorbed on the surface of each adsorbent moreover this parameter depends on others like temperature or solution s ph therefore it is not easy to compare adsorbents it should also be noticed that sometimes adsorbents with lower maximum capacity are cheaper so their use is more economical or they are eco friendly which is also essential the composite material was characterized by a parameter in different units calculated per surface of the material such a parameter is better if one considers future applications of the membrane coating material due to this fact it is not easy to compare the material with other adsorbents the comparison of adsorbents for tetracycline removal from solutions is shown in table 1 graphene oxide has the best adsorption properties so using these particles to prepare a new composite material is justified however it should be noticed that in the polymer matrix the active surface area is smaller than in the case of the suspension of go because the surface is blocked by the polymer although the composite material is not as efficient as a suspension of adsorbent it makes it possible to develop membrane systems for adsorption and filtration at the same time 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercial co polymers nexar kraton performance polymers inc and pebax 2533 arkema were used as a polymeric base as a solvent ethanol sigma aldrich was used go is the main adsorbent which was added in various amounts relative to polymer mass go was synthesized in the wut laboratory using the method described elsewhere 36 the adsorption properties of the prepared material were tested by experiments with aqueous solutions of pharmacological substances such as amoxicillin sigma aldrich sulfadiazine sigma aldrich and tetracycline pol aura 2 2 synthesis of materials the proposed composite material consists of a polymeric base and a main adsorbent graphene oxide go to prepare the material firstly a suspension of nanoparticles in a solvent was prepared at the same time a polymer solution with the same solvent was prepared after the polymer dissolved the suspension was added and the mixture was stirred for 24 h the materials were prepared using the inverse phase method when the solvent evaporated the material was immersed in demineralized water for 24 h in the next step the materials were dried in a furnace before the main test a purity test was performed the material was re immersed in water and the ph and conductivity were measured the test could indicate the presence of a solvent in the water the materials were then dried at room temperature the structure of the prepared composite material was characterized using scanning electron microscope sem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and thermal gravimetric analysis tga the samples were characterized by attenuated total reflection atr technique during ftir analysis tga was carried out at temperature ranging from 25 c to 600 c with 10 c min heating and 30 ml min argon flow 2 3 adsorption test the adsorption properties of the materials were tested in a stationary system in beakers at room temperature the composite materials with known surface area were placed in the beaker then the water solution of a chosen pharmaceutical was poured into the beaker with the material after 10 min 15 min 30 min and 45 min from the beginning of the experiment a sample of the pharmaceutical solution was taken the sample was analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometry the mode of the test was a scan for the wavelength between 250 and 400 nm using this mode one could observe possible impurities the concentration of the analyzed compound in the solution was determined based on a previously prepared standard curve the research was carried out for different concentrations of solutions of chosen pharmaceuticals and different surface areas of the adsorption material 0 0145 m2 and 0 0290 m2 according to the world health organization report of 2011 the concentration of pharmaceuticals in surface water and ground water is usually less than 100 ng l the concentration in drinking water does not exceed 50 ng l 37 in such concentrations the analysis of samples is quite troublesome therefore higher concentrations were used to analyze the adsorption properties of the material for matching adsorption models and kinetics of the process the value measured after 45 min from the beginning of experiment was the equilibrium value first tests were carried out for longer time however no significant changes were observed 2 4 adsorption isotherms adsorption is a process in which the substance binds to the solid s surface it is an effective method of purifying wastewater it does not depend on the presence of toxic compounds and does not produce new harmful substances 38 the process is described by adsorption isotherms which describe the relationship between the amount of the adsorbent on the surface of the material q i and its concentration in the aqueous solution c i at equilibrium and constant temperature the state of equilibrium is achieved when a phase containing an adsorbate is in contact with adsorption material long enough and the concentration of the adsorbate in both phases is at equilibrium 39 the collected data were used to analyze the adsorption process using the henry langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson equilibrium isotherms the simplest adsorption model is the henry isotherm described by a linear expression this one parameter model assumes that the molecules do not interact with one another and are separated from their closest neighbors which could be observed at low adsorbent concentration 40 henry isotherm model equation is as follows 2 1 q e k h c e where c e mg l is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate in the liquid phase q e mg m2 is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate on the surface and k h l m 2 is henry s adsorption constant another simple adsorption model is the langmuir isotherm model this model assumes monolayer adsorption onto an adsorbent s surface with a finite number of active sites and interactions between particles at low concentration the langmuir expression reduces to the henry isotherm model 41 the langmuir equation is expressed as 2 2 q e c e k l 1 c e α where c e mg l and q e mg m2 are as before α l mg k l l m 2 are langmuir constants the freundlich isotherm model is more complex the model assumes that an infinite amount of substance can be adsorbed 41 moreover it is used for modeling the adsorption on a liquid solid surface 42 the mathematical form of freundlich isotherm can be written as 2 3 q e k f c e 1 n where variables are as before 1 n is a parameter which presents adsorption intensity k f mg 1 1 n l1 n m2 is an empirical constant which represents adsorption capacity of the material 43 the redlich peterson isotherm model is a type of a three parameter isotherm model this model is a combination of langmuir and freundlich isotherms the expression does not describe monolayer adsorption as the langmuir isotherm model does so it could approach the henry isotherm at low concentration 44 the redlich peterson isotherm model is defined by the following expression 2 4 q e k r c e 1 b c e β where c e mg l and q e mg m2 are as before k r l mg is redlich peterson constant b l mg β is also constant β is a parameter between 0 and 1 if β 1 the equation reduces to the langmuir expression another three parameter equation the toth isotherm model was also considered the mathematical form of the toth isotherm can be written as 2 5 q e k t c e α t c e 1 t where variables are as before α t mg l k t l m 2 are toth constants 45 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the composite material the composite material obtained after successful synthesis was characterized by the methods mentioned in section 2 2 the samples of pebax and composite pebax and 5 go in ratio to polymer weight were compared the results of the measurements are presented in fig 1 vibrations characteristic of go such as co stretching 1710 1740 cm 1 and c o c stretching 1050 1150 cm 1 could also be observed for pebax sample however characteristic vibrations of oh stretching 3200 3600 cm 1 correspond to functional groups on the go surface 46 48 the subtraction spectra presented the difference in the absorbance intensity for bonds mentioned above a highly intense band corresponds to the presence of oh functional groups on the surface of the modified material in relation to the pure pebax 2533 also higher intensity of co and c o c bonds proves that the modification of the material was successful these functional groups observed on the surface could interact with pharmacological substances the results obtained in the thermogravimetric analysis tga of the pure pebax and pebax with go are shown in fig 2 both materials have similar thermal stability the difference can be observed at around 450 c according to the obtained results the residue of the modified material was 3 65 for pure polymer the amount of residue was 0 such results confirmed the presence of go in the modified material the residual value is less than the added go 5 suggesting a partial temperature degradation of go it should be emphasized that the additive does not adversely affect the thermal stability of the material successful creation of the modified material is also confirmed by microscopic photos of the material surface both material surfaces are shown in fig 3 the presence of a small quantity of go on the surface of the modified material is confirmed by sem photos it also proves that the composite material was created successfully 3 2 determining the effectiveness of the material in the first part of the experiments several solutions were made from pure co polymers solution with 5 and 10 of nexar and 5 of pebax and their adsorption properties for the sulfadiazine solution were tested it was found that the material made of the pebax solution did not show as good adsorptive properties as the material from nexar did but due to its brittleness it cannot be used in further studies then a composite forming solution was prepared with a concentration of 2 pebax with the addition of 5 go in relation to the weight of the polymer used it was observed that there was no improvement in the adsorption process with a higher go content what is more the higher the amount of go the higher the brittleness of the material based on these conclusions it was decided to perform a detailed analysis of the material made of a solution containing 2 pebax and 5 go in relation to the weight of the polymer it can be concluded that the presence of go on the surface has an impact on the effect of removing the pharmacological substance from the solution however the material prepared by pure pebax can also adsorb the substance from water in addition it should be noticed that the adsorptive properties of pebax are different for the analyzed substances the effectiveness of the material was tested and the presented results were calculated for the surface of the whole material due to that the comparison of the effectiveness of the materials is possible in the next part of the study changes in the concentration and effectiveness of the materials of two different areas during the adsorption of sulfadiazine amoxicillin and tetracycline were analyzed studies were conducted for various concentrations of these substances measurements of the concentration were made several times during the process changes in concentration for both analyzed materials are shown in fig 4 the concentration of the substance per unit of material area was calculated from the formula 3 1 c sur c in c t s 0 030 where c sur g m2 is substance concentration on the surface c in c t g l initial solution concentration and concentration at time t respectively s m2 surface area of the adsorbent material 0 030 is the volume of pharmaceutical compound solution used in the experiment l on the basis of the obtained results it can be concluded that the concentration of the substance in the solution decreases for both materials used which means an increase in the amount of the substance adsorbed by the tested samples over time this value tends to a certain value called the adsorption capacity of the material under given conditions c sur the results for sulfadiazine table 2 amoxicillin table 3 and tetracycline table 4 are presented for the last performed measurement presented at the time when equilibrium is reached the effectiveness was determined using a parameter analogous to the known clearance parameter used in dialyzers presented by the equation 3 2 e c i 0 c i c i 0 100 where c i0 g l is initial solution concentration of substance i c i g l final solution concentration of substance i on the basis of the obtained results the amount of adsorbed substances is similar c sur for the similar initial concentration the material that is two times smaller adsorbs half the amount of the substance compared to the bigger one in the case of analyzing adsorption of sulfadiazine amoxicillin and tetracycline the obtained results are analogical the material having a surface of 0 0145 m2 could remove 3 4 of pharmacological substance contained in the solution while the second analyzed material has the ability to remove up to 6 8 of pharmaceuticals the obtained results prove the effectiveness of the composite material if one compares the material to other adsorbents the results are promising poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes containing go could remove from 8 65 to 11 30 of dissolved organic carbon depending on the go concentration 17 such results are not too distant from the presented ones the suspension of graphene oxide could remove 35 of diclofenac and 12 of sulfamethoxazole 15 here should be noticed that pharmaceuticals have very differential structure so the composite could not remove them in the same amount the efficiency of removing organic substances for some composite materials could achieve more than 96 like for aerogel prepared by a combination of go and poly vinyl alcohol 15 however it has to be remembered that nanoparticles in a polymer matrix have less surface area due to pore blocking by a polymer 3 3 adsorption isotherms the final concentration values of the substance in the solution were used to analyze the adsorption process using isothermal models described in section 2 4 the isotherms were fitted using the least squares method the parameter values obtained from the equations and the degree of their matching i e the r 2 value are presented in table 5 moreover the matching of isotherms to experimental points is presented in fig 5 analyzing the results it can be concluded that redlich peterson isotherm model fits the best for all adsorbed substances however this model does not perfectly describe the adsorption because r 2 value is lower than 0 99 it seems obvious that the point for the highest concentration causes a significant deviation from the linear relationship with other points therefore it can be concluded that for lower concentrations also other models fit quite well to the experimental results it is difficult to clearly indicate the mechanism of adsorption of the tested pharmacological compounds on the composite it is certain that the adsorption takes place only on the graphene oxide and not on the polymer matrix all tested compounds i e amoxicillin a sulfadiazine s and tetracycline t have a number of functional groups such as basic amino groups primary s and tertiary t amide groups a and t sulfonamide groups s thiazole rings a and s acid phenolic groups a and t carboxyl groups a additionally they contain polar groups hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups therefore it can be expected that in contact with go chemical bonds ester amide and above all acid base interactions will be formed both in terms of bronsted interactions and between donor acceptor groups 3 4 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics was fitted to two models the pseudo first order model pfo 49 and the pseudo second order model pso 50 a pfo equation is 3 3 d q t dt k 1 q e q t where k 1 min 1 is the rate constant of pfo adsorption q e q t mg g are the amount of analyzed pharmacological substances that adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t min respectively the pso equation can be expressed as 3 4 d q t dt k 2 q e q t 2 where k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the rate constant of pso adsorption and q e q t mg g are as before the linear equations of these models for pfo and pso are respectively 3 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 3 6 1 q e q t 1 q e k 2 t the calculations were carried out for various concentrations of the solutions table 6 shows the average value of the adsorption kinetics parameters calculated from the kinetic models and the r 2 parameter the pfo model fits better for the adsorption of all substances both models pfo and pso in case of tetracycline and sulfadiazine fit to the experimental data in a similar way fitting the pfo model to the kinetics of the process suggests that the adsorption process does not occur as a chemisorption 51 4 conclusions a novel material graphene oxide in a pebax matrix demonstrates the ability to adsorb pharmaceutical substances the material can be used in the future as a coating for the membrane it can make the wastewater treatment process more efficient and decrease the amount of these substances in the aquatic environment the effectiveness of the materials are not as high as conventional adsorbent but there are no problem with filtration or the storage of used materials the greatest advantage of materials is the possibility of using them as coverings moreover these results obviously show a very well fit to the redlich peterson isotherm model so it is the prime candidate to analyze the adsorption behaviors of pharmaceuticals the results also show that the kinetics of the adsorption process is better described by the pseudo first order model than the pseudo second order model in case of all analyzed pharmacological substances it can be assumed that the data provided in this study will facilitate effective adsorption process applications in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments the authors would like to thank prof wojciech fabianowski for his valuable comments this research

performance polymers inc and pebax 2533 arkema were used as a polymeric base as a solvent ethanol sigma aldrich was used go is the main adsorbent which was added in various amounts relative to polymer mass go was synthesized in the wut laboratory using the method described elsewhere 36 the adsorption properties of the prepared material were tested by experiments with aqueous solutions of pharmacological substances such as amoxicillin sigma aldrich sulfadiazine sigma aldrich and tetracycline pol aura 2 2 synthesis of materials the proposed composite material consists of a polymeric base and a main adsorbent graphene oxide go to prepare the material firstly a suspension of nanoparticles in a solvent was prepared at the same time a polymer solution with the same solvent was prepared after the polymer dissolved the suspension was added and the mixture was stirred for 24 h the materials were prepared using the inverse phase method when the solvent evaporated the material was immersed in demineralized water for 24 h in the next step the materials were dried in a furnace before the main test a purity test was performed the material was re immersed in water and the ph and conductivity were measured the test could indicate the presence of a solvent in the water the materials were then dried at room temperature the structure of the prepared composite material was characterized using scanning electron microscope sem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and thermal gravimetric analysis tga the samples were characterized by attenuated total reflection atr technique during ftir analysis tga was carried out at temperature ranging from 25 c to 600 c with 10 c min heating and 30 ml min argon flow 2 3 adsorption test the adsorption properties of the materials were tested in a stationary system in beakers at room temperature the composite materials with known surface area were placed in the beaker then the water solution of a chosen pharmaceutical was poured into the beaker with the material after 10 min 15 min 30 min and 45 min from the beginning of the experiment a sample of the pharmaceutical solution was taken the sample was analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometry the mode of the test was a scan for the wavelength between 250 and 400 nm using this mode one could observe possible impurities the concentration of the analyzed compound in the solution was determined based on a previously prepared standard curve the research was carried out for different concentrations of solutions of chosen pharmaceuticals and different surface areas of the adsorption material 0 0145 m2 and 0 0290 m2 according to the world health organization report of 2011 the concentration of pharmaceuticals in surface water and ground water is usually less than 100 ng l the concentration in drinking water does not exceed 50 ng l 37 in such concentrations the analysis of samples is quite troublesome therefore higher concentrations were used to analyze the adsorption properties of the material for matching adsorption models and kinetics of the process the value measured after 45 min from the beginning of experiment was the equilibrium value first tests were carried out for longer time however no significant changes were observed 2 4 adsorption isotherms adsorption is a process in which the substance binds to the solid s surface it is an effective method of purifying wastewater it does not depend on the presence of toxic compounds and does not produce new harmful substances 38 the process is described by adsorption isotherms which describe the relationship between the amount of the adsorbent on the surface of the material q i and its concentration in the aqueous solution c i at equilibrium and constant temperature the state of equilibrium is achieved when a phase containing an adsorbate is in contact with adsorption material long enough and the concentration of the adsorbate in both phases is at equilibrium 39 the collected data were used to analyze the adsorption process using the henry langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson equilibrium isotherms the simplest adsorption model is the henry isotherm described by a linear expression this one parameter model assumes that the molecules do not interact with one another and are separated from their closest neighbors which could be observed at low adsorbent concentration 40 henry isotherm model equation is as follows 2 1 q e k h c e where c e mg l is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate in the liquid phase q e mg m2 is the equilibrium concentration of the adsorbate on the surface and k h l m 2 is henry s adsorption constant another simple adsorption model is the langmuir isotherm model this model assumes monolayer adsorption onto an adsorbent s surface with a finite number of active sites and interactions between particles at low concentration the langmuir expression reduces to the henry isotherm model 41 the langmuir equation is expressed as 2 2 q e c e k l 1 c e α where c e mg l and q e mg m2 are as before α l mg k l l m 2 are langmuir constants the freundlich isotherm model is more complex the model assumes that an infinite amount of substance can be adsorbed 41 moreover it is used for modeling the adsorption on a liquid solid surface 42 the mathematical form of freundlich isotherm can be written as 2 3 q e k f c e 1 n where variables are as before 1 n is a parameter which presents adsorption intensity k f mg 1 1 n l1 n m2 is an empirical constant which represents adsorption capacity of the material 43 the redlich peterson isotherm model is a type of a three parameter isotherm model this model is a combination of langmuir and freundlich isotherms the expression does not describe monolayer adsorption as the langmuir isotherm model does so it could approach the henry isotherm at low concentration 44 the redlich peterson isotherm model is defined by the following expression 2 4 q e k r c e 1 b c e β where c e mg l and q e mg m2 are as before k r l mg is redlich peterson constant b l mg β is also constant β is a parameter between 0 and 1 if β 1 the equation reduces to the langmuir expression another three parameter equation the toth isotherm model was also considered the mathematical form of the toth isotherm can be written as 2 5 q e k t c e α t c e 1 t where variables are as before α t mg l k t l m 2 are toth constants 45 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the composite material the composite material obtained after successful synthesis was characterized by the methods mentioned in section 2 2 the samples of pebax and composite pebax and 5 go in ratio to polymer weight were compared the results of the measurements are presented in fig 1 vibrations characteristic of go such as co stretching 1710 1740 cm 1 and c o c stretching 1050 1150 cm 1 could also be observed for pebax sample however characteristic vibrations of oh stretching 3200 3600 cm 1 correspond to functional groups on the go surface 46 48 the subtraction spectra presented the difference in the absorbance intensity for bonds mentioned above a highly intense band corresponds to the presence of oh functional groups on the surface of the modified material in relation to the pure pebax 2533 also higher intensity of co and c o c bonds proves that the modification of the material was successful these functional groups observed on the surface could interact with pharmacological substances the results obtained in the thermogravimetric analysis tga of the pure pebax and pebax with go are shown in fig 2 both materials have similar thermal stability the difference can be observed at around 450 c according to the obtained results the residue of the modified material was 3 65 for pure polymer the amount of residue was 0 such results confirmed the presence of go in the modified material the residual value is less than the added go 5 suggesting a partial temperature degradation of go it should be emphasized that the additive does not adversely affect the thermal stability of the material successful creation of the modified material is also confirmed by microscopic photos of the material surface both material surfaces are shown in fig 3 the presence of a small quantity of go on the surface of the modified material is confirmed by sem photos it also proves that the composite material was created successfully 3 2 determining the effectiveness of the material in the first part of the experiments several solutions were made from pure co polymers solution with 5 and 10 of nexar and 5 of pebax and their adsorption properties for the sulfadiazine solution were tested it was found that the material made of the pebax solution did not show as good adsorptive properties as the material from nexar did but due to its brittleness it cannot be used in further studies then a composite forming solution was prepared with a concentration of 2 pebax with the addition of 5 go in relation to the weight of the polymer used it was observed that there was no improvement in the adsorption process with a higher go content what is more the higher the amount of go the higher the brittleness of the material based on these conclusions it was decided to perform a detailed analysis of the material made of a solution containing 2 pebax and 5 go in relation to the weight of the polymer it can be concluded that the presence of go on the surface has an impact on the effect of removing the pharmacological substance from the solution however the material prepared by pure pebax can also adsorb the substance from water in addition it should be noticed that the adsorptive properties of pebax are different for the analyzed substances the effectiveness of the material was tested and the presented results were calculated for the surface of the whole material due to that the comparison of the effectiveness of the materials is possible in the next part of the study changes in the concentration and effectiveness of the materials of two different areas during the adsorption of sulfadiazine amoxicillin and tetracycline were analyzed studies were conducted for various concentrations of these substances measurements of the concentration were made several times during the process changes in concentration for both analyzed materials are shown in fig 4 the concentration of the substance per unit of material area was calculated from the formula 3 1 c sur c in c t s 0 030 where c sur g m2 is substance concentration on the surface c in c t g l initial solution concentration and concentration at time t respectively s m2 surface area of the adsorbent material 0 030 is the volume of pharmaceutical compound solution used in the experiment l on the basis of the obtained results it can be concluded that the concentration of the substance in the solution decreases for both materials used which means an increase in the amount of the substance adsorbed by the tested samples over time this value tends to a certain value called the adsorption capacity of the material under given conditions c sur the results for sulfadiazine table 2 amoxicillin table 3 and tetracycline table 4 are presented for the last performed measurement presented at the time when equilibrium is reached the effectiveness was determined using a parameter analogous to the known clearance parameter used in dialyzers presented by the equation 3 2 e c i 0 c i c i 0 100 where c i0 g l is initial solution concentration of substance i c i g l final solution concentration of substance i on the basis of the obtained results the amount of adsorbed substances is similar c sur for the similar initial concentration the material that is two times smaller adsorbs half the amount of the substance compared to the bigger one in the case of analyzing adsorption of sulfadiazine amoxicillin and tetracycline the obtained results are analogical the material having a surface of 0 0145 m2 could remove 3 4 of pharmacological substance contained in the solution while the second analyzed material has the ability to remove up to 6 8 of pharmaceuticals the obtained results prove the effectiveness of the composite material if one compares the material to other adsorbents the results are promising poly vinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes containing go could remove from 8 65 to 11 30 of dissolved organic carbon depending on the go concentration 17 such results are not too distant from the presented ones the suspension of graphene oxide could remove 35 of diclofenac and 12 of sulfamethoxazole 15 here should be noticed that pharmaceuticals have very differential structure so the composite could not remove them in the same amount the efficiency of removing organic substances for some composite materials could achieve more than 96 like for aerogel prepared by a combination of go and poly vinyl alcohol 15 however it has to be remembered that nanoparticles in a polymer matrix have less surface area due to pore blocking by a polymer 3 3 adsorption isotherms the final concentration values of the substance in the solution were used to analyze the adsorption process using isothermal models described in section 2 4 the isotherms were fitted using the least squares method the parameter values obtained from the equations and the degree of their matching i e the r 2 value are presented in table 5 moreover the matching of isotherms to experimental points is presented in fig 5 analyzing the results it can be concluded that redlich peterson isotherm model fits the best for all adsorbed substances however this model does not perfectly describe the adsorption because r 2 value is lower than 0 99 it seems obvious that the point for the highest concentration causes a significant deviation from the linear relationship with other points therefore it can be concluded that for lower concentrations also other models fit quite well to the experimental results it is difficult to clearly indicate the mechanism of adsorption of the tested pharmacological compounds on the composite it is certain that the adsorption takes place only on the graphene oxide and not on the polymer matrix all tested compounds i e amoxicillin a sulfadiazine s and tetracycline t have a number of functional groups such as basic amino groups primary s and tertiary t amide groups a and t sulfonamide groups s thiazole rings a and s acid phenolic groups a and t carboxyl groups a additionally they contain polar groups hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups therefore it can be expected that in contact with go chemical bonds ester amide and above all acid base interactions will be formed both in terms of bronsted interactions and between donor acceptor groups 3 4 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics was fitted to two models the pseudo first order model pfo 49 and the pseudo second order model pso 50 a pfo equation is 3 3 d q t dt k 1 q e q t where k 1 min 1 is the rate constant of pfo adsorption q e q t mg g are the amount of analyzed pharmacological substances that adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t min respectively the pso equation can be expressed as 3 4 d q t dt k 2 q e q t 2 where k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the rate constant of pso adsorption and q e q t mg g are as before the linear equations of these models for pfo and pso are respectively 3 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 3 6 1 q e q t 1 q e k 2 t the calculations were carried out for various concentrations of the solutions table 6 shows the average value of the adsorption kinetics parameters calculated from the kinetic models and the r 2 parameter the pfo model fits better for the adsorption of all substances both models pfo and pso in case of tetracycline and sulfadiazine fit to the experimental data in a similar way fitting the pfo model to the kinetics of the process suggests that the adsorption process does not occur as a chemisorption 51 4 conclusions a novel material graphene oxide in a pebax matrix demonstrates the ability to adsorb pharmaceutical substances the material can be used in the future as a coating for the membrane it can make the wastewater treatment process more efficient and decrease the amount of these substances in the aquatic environment the effectiveness of the materials are not as high as conventional adsorbent but there are no problem with filtration or the storage of used materials the greatest advantage of materials is the possibility of using them as coverings moreover these results obviously show a very well fit to the redlich peterson isotherm model so it is the prime candidate to analyze the adsorption behaviors of pharmaceuticals the results also show that the kinetics of the adsorption process is better described by the pseudo first order model than the pseudo second order model in case of all analyzed pharmacological substances it can be assumed that the data provided in this study will facilitate effective adsorption process applications in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
