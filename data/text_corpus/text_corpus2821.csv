m2 h respectively keywords polyamide membrane core shell biofuctionalized as lll ions rejection se ions rejections chitosan 1 introduction groundwater is the major source of drinking water in the less developed countries around the world 1 the release of arsenic as and selenium se from agricultural wastes and mining s or geological materials are the major components for the contamination of ground water 2 the uncontrolled release of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se contaminates caused the major health problems in usa china bangladesh india and pakistan 3 the massive toxicity and carcinogenic nature of arsenic and selenium ions have become a serious world wide issue 4 these contaminates are found in typical concentration ranges from 0 5 to above 100 ppm and 0 003 12 ppm respectively in waste water which resulted from industrial activities e g oil extraction refining agricultural irrigation coal mining metal smelting and minerals 5 arsenic is a dreadful hazardous component in both ground and surface water so it has become a typical environmental problem 6 long exposure to inorganic arsenic is more toxic and lead to various health effects such as diabetes circulatory disorders and skin lesions various forms of cancer including bladders kidney lungs and skin 7 therefore the world health organization who and us environmental protection agency us epa has fixed a maximum contamination level mcl of permissible as ⅰⅰⅰ in drinking water with a concentration minimization from 50 to 10 μg l 8 selenium is a widely used component of drugs photosensitive materials and semiconductor products anthropogenic activities such as the discharge of agricultural runoff and industrial waste water are the main common source of selenium into the environment the major soluble inorganic selenium species in the various water bodies are in the form of selenite seo3 2 and selenate seo4 2 which are toxic above the concentration range of 400 μg l 9 irritation of skin and eyes loss of hair and nails gastrointestinal disorders neurological damage and monstrous deformities occurs due to excess of selenium 10 because of high solubility selenate and selenite are the dominant species of selenium in the natural aquatic system thus it is great importance for the removal of hazardous as ⅰⅰⅰ and se from ground and surface water 11 epidemiological study in pakistan revealed the poisoning effect of as lll and se thus several hazardous water treatment techniques have been deeply studied with great attention for the remediation of these contaminates from ground water 12 these technologies include ion exchange adsorption biological treatment coagulation precipitation oxidation reduction membrane process technology e g reverse osmosis and nanofiltration nf 13 14 adsorbents which may become solid wastes of high as and se contents thus increases the cost and hazards for waste disposals which hindered the wide spread application of adsorbents technique for as and se contaminate removal 15 metal oxides bear excellent properties including ease of separation reuse and high absorption capacity a substantial risk has been assessed by the release of particles to the ultimate water that hinders the use of metal oxides which were widely studied and investigated especially iron hydro oxides 16 excess waste produced during recycling the exchange resin in the ion exchange process which is intricate and time consuming 17 among all these above mentioned techniques the most reliable and promising technique for hazardous waste water treatment is nanofiltration nf high effectiveness in operation and low cost makes the nf technique most attractive 18 to innovate new membranes for as ⅰⅰⅰ and se hazardous metallic compound removal impressive researches have been carried out till now however it is a still major problem of above mentioned membranes to achieve both high water permeance and rejection simultaneously a wide variety of researches has been made to develop the modified membrane with enhanced efficiency performance thermal stability water insolubility and minimized fouling effects cross linkage and blending procedures were adopted for the modification of membrane 19 cellulosic polymers polysulfone polypropylene and polyamide etc are widely being used for this purpose polyamide is one of the mostly used types of aliphatic polymer 20 it exhibits excellent mechanical thermal properties including high tensile strength high flame and heat resistance high flexibility good resilience low creep high impact strength and greater dimensional stability 21 due to the low coefficient of friction it provides excellent resistance to wear thermal properties of polyamide include high melting temperature 227 267 ⁰c and glass transition temperature 22 it has more chemical resistance to hydrocarbons and alkaline hydrolysis with a high absorption capacity and provides better results in water purification 23 solo polymer weakens in characteristics ability for commercial use such as less thermal stability less mechanical strength low flux less rejection and permeation ability the blending procedure with other polymers is an effective route and adopted to attain better desired results polyethylene glycol peg is a non volatile odorless in nature enhanced thermal stability excellent water retaining property hygroscopic in nature used as a hydrophilic polishing material with excellent absorbing and binding property and acts as a pore former in nf membranes 24 25 it has a biocompatible characteristic neutrality and nonirritating 26 it increases permeability and reduces protection against low ph if coated over the membrane surface the separation performance of the blended membrane can be enhanced by proper blending modification with chitosan based filler by reducing the polymer chains mobility 27 chitosan is a highly basic polysaccharide biocompatible and biodegradable natural polymer 28 29 its properties include solubility in various media polyelectrolyte behavior high charge density optical and structural characteristics ability to form a film 30 31 it also exhibits the properties of polycationic antibacterial activity nontoxic antioxidative and used as an adhesive with good membrane forming characteristics 32 33 to inhibit microbial growth it is used as a chelating agent that selectively binds to trace elements causing toxin production 34 kaolin clay is a phyllosilicate and most abundant clay mineral 35 it is long lasting relatively inert and is used as filler in purification and separation applications which imparts high mechanical strength and stiffness 36 it possesses the properties of high chemically stable swelling capacity compaction capability and has single layer structure 37 due to the large surface area and surface electrical charge it accommodates large organic and inorganic cation and has low expansion co efficient it enhances the structural and morphological properties 38 39 the

glass vials finally the filtrates were collected in a centrifuge tube for as ⅰⅰⅰ analysis the same procedure was performed for se analysis 4 3 short term as ⅰⅰⅰ and se filtration experiments rejection of arsenic and selenium of control and pa csbf membranes was evaluated using a dead end filtration hp4750 sterlitech usa single cell device during the whole filtration process the filtrate was collected after 1 h interval a feed solution containing 100 μg as l of naaso2 and nacl 0 01 mol l and 100 μg se l of na2seo4 were used to assess the performance of matrix membrane in as ⅰⅰⅰ and se

five 05 cycles of experiments were carried out for filtration generation cycle the duration of arsenic and selenium filtration was 8 h with a fixed permeate flux of 6 7 l m2h for both filtration and

5 results and discussion 5 1 ftir analysis fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of controlled and pa csbf 1 5 membranes the functional groups of the membrane and the formation of blending network were examined these molecules can form a hydrogen bond so this interaction among these groups affected the spectra the characteristics band for chitosan cs structure of blended pa csbf 1 5 is reported at 1099 cm 1 and shifts towards lower frequency to 1091 cm 1 as cs blends with pa when the quantity of biocomposite increased from 10 50 mg during the modification with clay 2935 to 2943 cm 1 represented the stretching vibration of the c h bond the bending vibration in choh and nhco of amide iii were observed at 1350 cm 1 and 1257 cm 1 in fig 2 sio stretching al o stretching and si o bending were noticed at between 600 400 cm 1 the sharp peak at 1074 cm 1 along with shoulder peak at 929 cm 1 was correlated to sio stretching while bending in nh was examined at peak 1543 cm 1 and sioal at around 758 cm 1 were detected in the composite membrane graph incorporated with clay particles when peg was added a new peak at 2943 cm 1 was observed which attributed to ch stretching band of ch2 group from peg the characteristics ch stretching bands of methylene groups are evident the presence of polymers in intercalates 40 co stretching in amide group amide i vibration was shown in the band at 1637 cm 1 nh bending in the amide group amide ii vibration was represented by 1543 cm 1 the stretching vibration of nh2 groups oh groups and intermolecular hydrogen bond which overlapped each other can be observed at 3296 cm 1 686 cm 1 band represented the deformation vibration of polymers 41 the formation of sio bond with chitosan and polyamide was confirmed at 1099 cm 1 and shifts towards lower number at 1091 cm 1 which indicated an interaction between the polyamide pa and kaolin clay nanocomposite 42 these findings confirmed the hydrogen bonding among chitosan kaolin silicate hydroxylated group and amino hydroxyl functional group ascertained in scheme 1 5 2 thermogravimetric analysis tga fig 3 displays thermal degradation curve of control and pa csbf membranes and are described in the form of weight loss versus temperature the thermal behavior of the control membrane was analyzed in three step degradation the first step was examined between 30 270 c with a weight loss of 18 67 due to the elimination of loosely bound water molecules and entrapped volatile organic matters the second stage degradation from onset to offset was observed between 270 450 c with a major weight loss of 91 79 due to polymer chain degradation this is due to the fact that peg group are less thermally stable than pa but overall stability of the control membrane was enhanced 43 the third and final stage depicted constant thermal profile range from 430 1200 c associated with the carbonization of degraded product to the residue and is represented in table 3 thermograms of pa csbf 1 5 membrane showed similar steps which attributed to the elimination of loosely bound water molecules and the fact that chitosan and peg polymers are hydrophilic but latter are less hygroscopic and range between 30 270 c with the weight loss of 16 24 11 18 the second step represents the onset from 280 to offset of 490 c with a weight loss of about 81 65 75 45 this second step was attributed to polymer degradation and depolymerization of acetylated deacetylated units of the chitosan 44 the final step expressed the carbonization of thermally degraded product to ash and the temperature ranges from 490 1200 c the experimental data indicated that almost 50 weight loss for control pa csbf1 and pa csbf5 existed at 340 370 and 372 5 c respectively moreover 75 weight loss for control pa csbf1 and pa csbf5 were noticed at 365 390 and 450 c respectively this proved that tga curve of pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membrane was found more thermally stable with a temperature of 490 c and 480 as compared to other control and modified membranes although modified membranes produced the improvement in the thermal property with gradually increasing quantity of chitosan the percentage residue for control and modified membranes were also presented in table 2 5 3 contact angle analysis hydrophilicity of the membranes i e the affinity for water molecules to wet the solid surface was measured through contact angle analysis in fig 4 it was obvious that control membrane has the highest contact angle 68 compared to modified membranes the increase of hydrophilicity was observed in pa csbf 1 4 membrane with a decrease in contact angle as the quantity of chitosan clay content was gradually increased this low value in the modified membrane was due to the hydrophilic nature of chitosan and peg the enhanced hydrophilicity ensured the increased permeation of the modified membranes as the hydrogen bonding was developed due to the hydrophilic group oh present on the surface of peg and biocomposite the overall increase in hydrophilic behavior was observed in modified membranes compared to the control membrane but pa csbf4 membrane was found more hydrophilic among all membranes with the lowest contact angle 46 the decreased in contact angle in pa csbf4 membrane was because of the segmental and functional mobility of chitosan and migration of polyamide chains 45 hydrophilic group migration to the inner bulk part of the pa csbf5 membrane resulted increase in contact angle and reduced in the surface area between the water drop and surface of the membrane it was also might be that chitosan blending was unevenly distributed and might block the bulk pores of the membrane 46 5 4 sem analysis the surface and cross section images of control and modified membranes are displayed in fig 5 it is evident that no moieties were observed on the surface of the control membrane the control membrane has smooth surface morphology the smooth structure was due to the direct evaporation of the casting polymer solution 47 the formation of the smooth surface was also as a result of the low diffusion rate of peg into the polymer solution 48 however nodule structure at cross section layer was exhibited in the control membrane smooth evaluation of morphology and fracture on the surface was observed on modified membranes 1 5 which can be explained based on blending of chitosan following the blending of biocomposite nanoparticles pores and nanovoids were detected on the surface of modified membranes these formations were due to the presence of hydrophilic nanoparticles in the casting solution elevating the demixing rate the compact and dense structure could also be seen in the modified membrane because of high shrinkage and compact structure of chitosan biopolymer 49 increasing the chitosan concentration gradually increase in pores and voids formation was observed from pa csbf 1 4 formation of porous structure was considered that chitosan particles entered the clay layer as these molecules are attracted towards the negative charged presence of peg act as porogen into the composition of casting caused an increase in the porous structure of modified membrane 50 higher chitosan concentration brought higher compatibility of the modified membrane which is evident of hydrogen bonding between molecules and acetyl contents of chitosan ascertained by ftir 51 comparing the surface image of pa csbf5 membrane with modified membranes especially with pa csbf4 we could observe the agglomeration and blocking of pores which is due to the stocking of chitosan clay and non homogeneous mixing at some points however pa csbf4 membrane found more compatible with enhanced porous structure compared to control and pa csbf5 membrane 5 5 afm analysis the topography and surface roughness of control and pa csbf membranes are presented in fig 6 nodules formation and its pattern variation were observed dark and bright sides were viewed in control and pa csbf 1 5 membranes which represent the interstitial domains and nodules respectively also the root means square rms and values of average roughness ra were reported in table 3 from the data reported it was concluded that the pa control membrane has the lowest mean roughness 11 86 nm and rms 185 68 nm from afm images pa csbf 1 5 membranes showed high ridges and valley like structures surface roughness and effective surface area have direct relation with each other 52 it was examined that pa csbf5 membrane has a higher surface roughness compared to pa csbf4 membrane the surface roughness slightly increased with the increase of c sbf nanoparticles in modified membranes pa csbf5 membrane has higher rms and ra values than pa csbf4 membrane but a rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions was low it could be described as in pa csbf5 membrane that the polymer chains moved further apart and enhanced free volume so the membrane becomes more open 53 this decrease in rejection also owed to the smooth uniform surface compared to pa csbf4 membranes due to low interactions between nanoclay particles and polymer chains which provide the less surface area 54 increase in nodular size in pa csbf4 membrane surface was due to the fact of the enhancement of inter chain entanglement and polymer aggregation increase in number of pores also contributed to the increase in surface roughness and ions rejection 55 5 6 membrane performance 5 6 1 effect of transmembrane pressure tmp on permeation flux the pure water permeability has a direct relation with the surface hydrophilicity fig 7 a depicts the effect of tmp on the water permeation flux and pure water permeability of the control membrane and modified membranes were 12 declined difference at 0 5 bar tmp to study the preliminary evaluation of the hydrophilicity of control and c sbf membranes contact angles were also measured as pa csbf4 membrane has a smaller contact angle 46 than control and pa csbf5 membrane this membrane was considered to be more hydrophilic control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 has the permeation flux of 401 444 and 452 l m2h against 0 5 bar tmp respectively c s biocomposite enhances the hydrophilic behavior of modified membranes resulted in enhanced permeation flux 56 furthermore the pa csbf4 membrane was stable that allows the membrane to remain in its integrity as indicated by the permeate flux versus tmp curve 5 6 2 effect of permeation flux on membrane performance fig 7 b c described the effect of permeation flux on the rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions respectively solution diffusion model elucidated the transport mechanism of the membrane which involves three steps 1 sorption at the surface of the membrane 2 diffusion into the membrane and 3 desorption in fig 7 b c it was observed that control membrane has low rejection at high permeation flux compared to modified membranes sorption of water into the membrane was due to the hydrophilic nature of chitosan which acts as driving force 57 in fig 7 b c it was examined that with the increased of permeate flux the removal of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions has increased the increase in rejection in modified membranes was due to the migration of chitosan molecules towards the negative charge of clay layer and formed porous structure 58 addition of peg also augmented the surface porosity and enhanced rejection as peg acts as a pore former this was due to the formation of nanovoids on the surface of the membranes 59 the increased content of the biocomposite nanoparticles in membranes enhances the membrane surface roughness which caused the augmentation in permeability ascertained by afm and sem micrographs in which these particles were dispersed 60 salt rejection also occurred due to electrostatic repulsion known as donnon effect 61 all these aforementioned reasons resulted in the increased rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions in pa csbf4 membrane as indicated in fig 7 b c the pa csbfc4 membrane presents the second highest flux with maximum rejection upto 99 of arsenic and upto 96 of selenium was obtained this change in rejection was due to the development of hydrogen bonding of amine group present on chitosan explained in scheme 1 and helped extensive blending resulted in the maximum exclusion of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se pa csbf5 membrane compromised the salt rejection but giving more water flux compared to pa csbf4 which might be due to the agglomeration and non homogeneous dispersion of clay particles thus resulted in the blocking of pores this also might be attributed in the swelling of the membrane in which polymer chains move further apart resulted in increased in free volume which allows the passage of salts resulting in maximum flux with a decline in rejection 62 hence it was proved that pa csbfc4 membrane was the best removal of ions with low pressure drop and optimum permeable flux compared to control and other modified membranes 5 6 3 effect of time on performance with without regeneration long and short term performance of control and modified membranes were evaluated by determining the variation of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se removal efficiency as a function of time as shown in fig 8 a b c d e f to evaluate membrane performance the predominant indicator is the membrane regeneration ability for this purpose membrane was re filtered with h2so4 hno3 and naoh it was notable that in the absence of regeneration the rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ ions of control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membranes were low 25 93 91 in case of h2so4 35 95 90 in case of hno3 whereas in case of naoh the rejection was 26 94 and 92 within 3 h short time similarly the rejection of se ions of control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membranes was 26 91 90 in case of h2so4 32 96 92 in case of hno3 and 28 91 and 91 in case of naoh after 3 h filtration run this means that pa intercalated biocomposite nanoparticles membrane was capable of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions rejection for a long period the performance of control pa csbfc4 and pa csbfc5 membrane for long term filtration of arsenic and selenium ions were observed by h2so4 hno3 and naoh regenerating eluents in fig 8 a b c the as ⅰⅰⅰ removal efficiency was increased upto 40 97 97 of control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membrane after washing with h2so4 eluent similarly after washing with hno3 eluent the removal efficiency increased upto 39 97 96 of control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membranes whereas using naoh as regenerating eluent the rejection was enhanced upto 42 99 98 of control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membranes in every case the maximum sample period was 7 h from above results it was observed that 2 3 reduction of as was obtained in case of h2so4 and hno3 eluent for h2so4 the reduction was associated with formation of complex between sulfate ions and functional groups leaving the as ions in case of hno3 the reduction might be associated with adsorption group complexes and incomplete desorption thus naoh was an efficient regenerating agent for removal of as ions after the long term filtration similarly h2so4 hno3 and naoh eluent was used for se ions rejection and shown in fig 8 d e and f the se ions rejection efficiency in the sample period of 6 h was 33 94 96 for h2so4 eluent 34 98 91 for hno3 and 38 96 95 in the sample period of 7 h after naoh regeneration hence hno3 was an efficient regenerating agent for removal of se ions after the long term filtration rejection of as and se were examined 99 and 98 respectively after long term filtration which proved that pa csbf4 membrane possesses great potential for the removal of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions from drinking water 5 6 4 effect of ph on membrane performance the influence of ph on the rejection capacity of control and pa csbf membranes were observed at different ph mediums ph 5 acidic medium ph 7 neutral medium ph 9 basic medium the performance of membranes is changing with solution ph fig 9 a depicted the highest rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ at ph 9 in basic medium followed by a neutral medium in acidic medium the control and modified membranes did not show any significant rejection it was evident from the results that pa csbf4 membrane compared to control and pa csbf5 membranes showed maximum rejection of arsenic in basic medium but in acidic medium the chitosan showed soluble behavior in water due to the presence of primary amine group on chitosan with the capacity of protonation and formation of water soluble substance 63 the effect of ph on arsenic removal was previously studied by aremu lay et al and investigated the removal of as and as v from drinking water by a silica based catalytic media dmi 65 the adsorption kinetic was evaluated at different ph 5 6 7 and 8 5 while the contact time was 6 h several batch tests were conducted and maximum adsorption of as occurred at ph 5 64 in comparison with the study of salazar h et al who investigated pvdf hfp bayerite composite with different aluminum hydroxide filler content for arsenic removal from water pvdf hfp was prepared by solvent casting in dead end cell filtration tests of arsenic standard solution of 100 μg l the arsenic rejection was around 60 after 1 h thus pvdf hfp bayerite composite was found suitable for arsenic removal from water 65 the influence of ph on the rejection of selenium was also examined and from fig 9 b it was clear evident that the same performance was observed for se rejection as was in the case of as ⅰⅰⅰ rejection in basic medium the se rejection was upto 96 performed by the pa csbf4 membrane and decline in rejection was evident in pa csbf5 membrane followed by the neutral medium deprotonation of an amine group and ionization of carboxyl group increased with an increase in solution ph resulting in increased rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se 66 in comparison with the previous study proposed by mishra d who studied and characterized zeolites from deccan trap for the removal of selenium from wastewater the concentration of selenium after the exchange was obtained by microprocessor differential pulse polarography dpp the exchange of selenium was found 92 75 for scolecite while it was 68 for stilbite 67 bleiman n and y g mishael designed and investigated the polymer clay composite to adsorb selenium from water chitosan montmorillonite composite exhibited the highest adsorption efficiency the adsorption by the composite was independent of ph selenium adsorption by the composite from water brought levels below who limit the adsorption was selective for selenium even in the presence of sulfur in comparison with al oxide the adsorption of selenium by composite was higher and readsorption of selenium was also demonstrated in that study 68 5 6 5 effects of coexisting anions and cations on removal of as and se various co anions and cations may affect the removal of as and se from waste water thus the influence of other co anions and cations such as phosphate bicarbonate nitrate chloride and sulfate were tested to understand the effect in as and se adsorption behavior as shown in fig 9 c the most significant effect on as and se removal was exerted by the phosphate with increasing concentration of phosphate as and se removal decreased which can be described to the structural similarities this structural similarity allowed phosphate to compete for the adsorption site on membrane 69 comparatively bicarbonate appeared to influence as and se removal by membranes nitrate and chloride has a little influence on the removal of as and se similarly sulfate did not interfere with the removal of as and se to noticeable extent 70 5 6 6 zeta potential measurement the charge density on membrane surface affected the separation performance i e salt rejection and was characterized by zeta potential fig 9 d exhibited the different zeta potential of control and pa csbf membranes and these values were obtained at various ph ranges of 5 7 and 9 respectively the negative charge surface of control membrane was attributed to the fact of deprotonation of the carboxyl group cooh coo on the polyamide layer 71 the trend of charges on the surface of membranes has changed when modified with chitosan clay nanoparticles the chitosan particles play a prominent role in overall charge property and were observed in fig 9 d the pa csbf 1 5 membranes have increasingly higher charge density with an increase of chitosan clay content the results depicted that pa csbf5 membrane has a higher negatively charged surface compared to pa csbf4 due to less amount of chitosan in ratio the pa csbf4 membrane has optimum charge density compared to control membrane due to the migration of chitosan clay nanoparticles which were negatively charged 72 the enhanced negative charged surfaces hydrophilicity and morphology of the membranes confirmed the hydrogen bonding among novel blended pa csbf membrane as shown in scheme 1 6 conclusion pa blended membranes were prepared adopting two step method via solution casting by varying concentrations of chitosan clay nanoparticles 10 50 mg it was confirmed that with increasing the quantity of c sbf composite the hydrophilic behavior of membranes increased upto pa csbf4 the blending and hydrogen bonding among pa peg and c sbf was confirmed by ftir enhanced surface roughness and pores formation were observed on the membrane surface of pa csbf4 by sem and afm analysis increased in thermal stability profile was observed by tga but the control membrane has lower thermal stability the selective interaction of c sbf composite with pa peg membrane was confirmed by obtaining the permeation flux of 444 l m2h with optimal rejection of 99 and 98 through pa csbf4 membranes than control and other modified membranes moreover membrane has favorable regeneration ability with naoh and hno3 hence it is concluded that solution casting is an effective

developed countries around the world 1 the release of arsenic as and selenium se from agricultural wastes and mining s or geological materials are the major components for the contamination of ground water 2 the uncontrolled release of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se contaminates caused the major health problems in usa china bangladesh india and pakistan 3 the massive toxicity and carcinogenic nature of arsenic and selenium ions have become a serious world wide issue 4 these contaminates are found in typical concentration ranges from 0 5 to above 100 ppm and 0 003 12 ppm respectively in waste water which resulted from industrial activities e g oil extraction refining agricultural irrigation coal mining metal smelting and minerals 5 arsenic is a dreadful hazardous component in both ground and surface water so it has become a typical environmental problem 6 long exposure to inorganic arsenic is more toxic and lead to various health effects such as diabetes circulatory disorders and skin lesions various forms of cancer including bladders kidney lungs and skin 7 therefore the world health organization who and us environmental protection agency us epa has fixed a maximum contamination level mcl of permissible as ⅰⅰⅰ in drinking water with a concentration minimization from 50 to 10 μg l 8 selenium is a widely used component of drugs photosensitive materials and semiconductor products anthropogenic activities such as the discharge of agricultural runoff and industrial waste water are the main common source of selenium into the environment the major soluble inorganic selenium species in the various water bodies are in the form of selenite seo3 2 and selenate seo4 2 which are toxic above the concentration range of 400 μg l 9 irritation of skin and eyes loss of hair and nails gastrointestinal disorders neurological damage and monstrous deformities occurs due to excess of selenium 10 because of high solubility selenate and selenite are the dominant species of selenium in the natural aquatic system thus it is great importance for the removal of hazardous as ⅰⅰⅰ and se from ground and surface water 11 epidemiological study in pakistan revealed the poisoning effect of as lll and se thus several hazardous water treatment techniques have been deeply studied with great attention for the remediation of these contaminates from ground water 12 these technologies include ion exchange adsorption biological treatment coagulation precipitation oxidation reduction membrane process technology e g reverse osmosis and nanofiltration nf 13 14 adsorbents which may become solid wastes of high as and se contents thus increases the cost and hazards for waste disposals which hindered the wide spread application of adsorbents technique for as and se contaminate removal 15 metal oxides bear excellent properties including ease of separation reuse and high absorption capacity a substantial risk has been assessed by the release of particles to the ultimate water that hinders the use of metal oxides which were widely studied and investigated especially iron hydro oxides 16 excess waste produced during recycling the exchange resin in the ion exchange process which is intricate and time consuming 17 among all these above mentioned techniques the most reliable and promising technique for hazardous waste water treatment is nanofiltration nf high effectiveness in operation and low cost makes the nf technique most attractive 18 to innovate new membranes for as ⅰⅰⅰ and se hazardous metallic compound removal impressive researches have been carried out till now however it is a still major problem of above mentioned membranes to achieve both high water permeance and rejection simultaneously a wide variety of researches has been made to develop the modified membrane with enhanced efficiency performance thermal stability water insolubility and minimized fouling effects cross linkage and blending procedures were adopted for the modification of membrane 19 cellulosic polymers polysulfone polypropylene and polyamide etc are widely being used for this purpose polyamide is one of the mostly used types of aliphatic polymer 20 it exhibits excellent mechanical thermal properties including high tensile strength high flame and heat resistance high flexibility good resilience low creep high impact strength and greater dimensional stability 21 due to the low coefficient of friction it provides excellent resistance to wear thermal properties of polyamide include high melting temperature 227 267 ⁰c and glass transition temperature 22 it has more chemical resistance to hydrocarbons and alkaline hydrolysis with a high absorption capacity and provides better results in water purification 23 solo polymer weakens in characteristics ability for commercial use such as less thermal stability less mechanical strength low flux less rejection and permeation ability the blending procedure with other polymers is an effective route and adopted to attain better desired results polyethylene glycol peg is a non volatile odorless in nature enhanced thermal stability excellent water retaining property hygroscopic in nature used as a hydrophilic polishing material with excellent absorbing and binding property and acts as a pore former in nf membranes 24 25 it has a biocompatible characteristic neutrality and nonirritating 26 it increases permeability and reduces protection against low ph if coated over the membrane surface the separation performance of the blended membrane can be enhanced by proper blending modification with chitosan based filler by reducing the polymer chains mobility 27 chitosan is a highly basic polysaccharide biocompatible and biodegradable natural polymer 28 29 its properties include solubility in various media polyelectrolyte behavior high charge density optical and structural characteristics ability to form a film 30 31 it also exhibits the properties of polycationic antibacterial activity nontoxic antioxidative and used as an adhesive with good membrane forming characteristics 32 33 to inhibit microbial growth it is used as a chelating agent that selectively binds to trace elements causing toxin production 34 kaolin clay is a phyllosilicate and most abundant clay mineral 35 it is long lasting relatively inert and is used as filler in purification and separation applications which imparts high mechanical strength and stiffness 36 it possesses the properties of high chemically stable swelling capacity compaction capability and has single layer structure 37 due to the large surface area and surface electrical charge it accommodates large organic and inorganic cation and has low expansion co efficient it enhances the structural and morphological properties 38 39 the

parameter for strongly adsorbed solutes of limited solubility and was assessed for as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions removal to calculate the adsorption capacity of the pa csbf modified membranes a batch adsorption experiment was performed by a flip oscillator ggc e beijing guottan institute of high tech automation instrument biocomposite 30 mg particles were added in a glass vial and each glass vials were filled with arsenic and selenium solution 30 ml containing nacl 0 001 m solution and 100 μg l of arsenic and selenium with a solution ph of 5 7 and 9 these glass vials were placed in the flip

glass vials finally the filtrates were collected in a centrifuge tube for as ⅰⅰⅰ analysis the same procedure was performed for se analysis 4 3 short term as ⅰⅰⅰ and se filtration experiments rejection of arsenic and selenium of control and pa csbf membranes was evaluated using a dead end filtration hp4750 sterlitech usa single cell device during the whole filtration process the filtrate was collected after 1 h interval a feed solution containing 100 μg as l of naaso2 and nacl 0 01 mol l and 100 μg se l of na2seo4 were used to assess the performance of matrix membrane in as ⅰⅰⅰ and se removal the effect of biocomposite mass loading on c sbf modified membranes were investigated by varying biocomposite concentration from 10 to 50 mg as shown in table 2 the impact of ph solution on arsenic and selenium removal was done by varying the ph to 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 with hcl or naoh 1 m solution the experiment was performed for 3 h at a constant permeate flux rate of 6 7 l m2h following eq

samples were then analyzed of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se speciation for further characterization the membrane specimen was also prepared after the filtration had run the filtration process was tested for 8 h with a controlled permeate flux of 6 7 l m2h throughout the run the adsorption capacity of used c sbf modified membrane for as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions species were reacquired by performing an intermittent regeneration steps with that parallel long term filtration experiments similar to short term filtration experiment h2so4 hno3 and naoh 0 001 m with a ph 9 was employed as the regenerating agent total five 05 cycles of experiments were carried out for filtration generation cycle the duration of arsenic and selenium filtration was 8 h with a fixed permeate flux of 6 7 l m2h for both filtration and regeneration studies 4 5 zeta potential the charge property of control and pa csbf 1 5 membranes surface was characterized by zeta potential and was performed via a current method on an electrokinetic analyzer eka anton paar gmbh austria for determination of zeta potential an aqueous solution of kcl 0 001 mol l was prepared influenced by various ph values of the solution to adjust the ph values hydrochloric acid hcl and potassium hydroxide koh was used visolab for surpass software was used to control the measurement progress and the measured values were automatically converted to the zeta

5 results and discussion 5 1 ftir analysis fig 2 shows the ftir spectra of controlled and pa csbf 1 5 membranes the functional groups of the membrane and the formation of blending network were examined these molecules can form a hydrogen bond so this interaction among these groups affected the spectra the characteristics band for chitosan cs structure of blended pa csbf 1 5 is reported at 1099 cm 1 and shifts towards lower frequency to 1091 cm 1 as cs blends with pa when the quantity of biocomposite increased from 10 50 mg during the modification with clay 2935 to 2943 cm 1 represented the stretching vibration of the c h bond the bending vibration in choh and nhco of amide iii were observed at 1350 cm 1 and 1257 cm 1 in fig 2 sio stretching al o stretching and si o bending were noticed at between 600 400 cm 1 the sharp peak at 1074 cm 1 along with shoulder peak at 929 cm 1 was correlated to sio stretching while bending in nh was examined at peak 1543 cm 1 and sioal at around 758 cm 1 were detected in the composite membrane graph incorporated with clay particles when peg was added a new peak at 2943 cm 1 was observed which attributed to ch stretching band of ch2 group from peg the characteristics ch stretching bands of methylene groups are evident the presence of polymers in intercalates 40 co stretching in amide group amide i vibration was shown in the band at 1637 cm 1 nh bending in the amide group amide ii vibration was represented by 1543 cm 1 the stretching vibration of nh2 groups oh groups and intermolecular hydrogen bond which overlapped each other can be observed at 3296 cm 1 686 cm 1 band represented the deformation vibration of polymers 41 the formation of sio bond with chitosan and polyamide was confirmed at 1099 cm 1 and shifts towards lower number at 1091 cm 1 which indicated an interaction between the polyamide pa and kaolin clay nanocomposite 42 these findings confirmed the hydrogen bonding among chitosan kaolin silicate hydroxylated group and amino hydroxyl functional group ascertained in scheme 1 5 2 thermogravimetric analysis tga fig 3 displays thermal degradation curve of control and pa csbf membranes and are described in the form of weight loss versus temperature the thermal behavior of the control membrane was analyzed in three step degradation the first step was examined between 30 270 c with a weight loss of 18 67 due to the elimination of loosely bound water molecules and entrapped volatile organic matters the second stage degradation from onset to offset was observed between 270 450 c with a major weight loss of 91 79 due to polymer chain degradation this is due to the fact that peg group are less thermally stable than pa but overall stability of the control membrane was enhanced 43 the third and final stage depicted constant thermal profile range from 430 1200 c associated with the carbonization of degraded product to the residue and is represented in table 3 thermograms of pa csbf 1 5 membrane showed similar steps which attributed to the elimination of loosely bound water molecules and the fact that chitosan and peg polymers are hydrophilic but latter are less hygroscopic and range between 30 270 c with the weight loss of 16 24 11 18 the second step represents the onset from 280 to offset of 490 c with a weight loss of about 81 65 75 45 this second step was attributed to polymer degradation and depolymerization of acetylated deacetylated units of the chitosan 44 the final step expressed the carbonization of thermally degraded product to ash and the temperature ranges from 490 1200 c the experimental data indicated that almost 50 weight loss for control pa csbf1 and pa csbf5 existed at 340 370 and 372 5 c respectively moreover 75 weight loss for control pa csbf1 and pa csbf5 were noticed at 365 390 and 450 c respectively this proved that tga curve of pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membrane was found more thermally stable with a temperature of 490 c and 480 as compared to other control and modified membranes although modified membranes produced the improvement in the thermal property with gradually increasing quantity of chitosan the percentage residue for control and modified membranes were also presented in table 2 5 3 contact angle analysis hydrophilicity of the membranes i e the affinity for water molecules to wet the solid surface was measured through contact angle analysis in fig 4 it was obvious that control membrane has the highest contact angle 68 compared to modified membranes the increase of hydrophilicity was observed in pa csbf 1 4 membrane with a decrease in contact angle as the quantity of chitosan clay content was gradually increased this low value in the modified membrane was due to the hydrophilic nature of chitosan and peg the enhanced hydrophilicity ensured the increased permeation of the modified membranes as the hydrogen bonding was developed due to the hydrophilic group oh present on the surface of peg and biocomposite the overall increase in hydrophilic behavior was observed in modified membranes compared to the control membrane but pa csbf4 membrane was found more hydrophilic among all membranes with the lowest contact angle 46 the decreased in contact angle in pa csbf4 membrane was because of the segmental and functional mobility of chitosan and migration of polyamide chains 45 hydrophilic group migration to the inner bulk part of the pa csbf5 membrane resulted increase in contact angle and reduced in the surface area between the water drop and surface of the membrane it was also might be that chitosan blending was unevenly distributed and might block the bulk pores of the membrane 46 5 4 sem analysis the surface and cross section images of control and modified membranes are displayed in fig 5 it is evident that no moieties were observed on the surface of the control membrane the control membrane has smooth surface morphology the smooth structure was due to the direct evaporation of the casting polymer solution 47 the formation of the smooth surface was also as a result of the low diffusion rate of peg into the polymer solution 48 however nodule structure at cross section layer was exhibited in the control membrane smooth evaluation of morphology and fracture on the surface was observed on modified membranes 1 5 which can be explained based on blending of chitosan following the blending of biocomposite nanoparticles pores and nanovoids were detected on the surface of modified membranes these formations were due to the presence of hydrophilic nanoparticles in the casting solution elevating the demixing rate the compact and dense structure could also be seen in the modified membrane because of high shrinkage and compact structure of chitosan biopolymer 49 increasing the chitosan concentration gradually increase in pores and voids formation was observed from pa csbf 1 4 formation of porous structure was considered that chitosan particles entered the clay layer as these molecules are attracted towards the negative charged presence of peg act as porogen into the composition of casting caused an increase in the porous structure of modified membrane 50 higher chitosan concentration brought higher compatibility of the modified membrane which is evident of hydrogen bonding between molecules and acetyl contents of chitosan ascertained by ftir 51 comparing the surface image of pa csbf5 membrane with modified membranes especially with pa csbf4 we could observe the agglomeration and blocking of pores which is due to the stocking of chitosan clay and non homogeneous mixing at some points however pa csbf4 membrane found more compatible with enhanced porous structure compared to control and pa csbf5 membrane 5 5 afm analysis the topography and surface roughness of control and pa csbf membranes are presented in fig 6 nodules formation and its pattern variation were observed dark and bright sides were viewed in control and pa csbf 1 5 membranes which represent the interstitial domains and nodules respectively also the root means square rms and values of average roughness ra were reported in table 3 from the data reported it was concluded that the pa control membrane has the lowest mean roughness 11 86 nm and rms 185 68 nm from afm images pa csbf 1 5 membranes showed high ridges and valley like structures surface roughness and effective surface area have direct relation with each other 52 it was examined that pa csbf5 membrane has a higher surface roughness compared to pa csbf4 membrane the surface roughness slightly increased with the increase of c sbf nanoparticles in modified membranes pa csbf5 membrane has higher rms and ra values than pa csbf4 membrane but a rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions was low it could be described as in pa csbf5 membrane that the polymer chains moved further apart and enhanced free volume so the membrane becomes more open 53 this decrease in rejection also owed to the smooth uniform surface compared to pa csbf4 membranes due to low interactions between nanoclay particles and polymer chains which provide the less surface area 54 increase in nodular size in pa csbf4 membrane surface was due to the fact of the enhancement of inter chain entanglement and polymer aggregation increase in number of pores also contributed to the increase in surface roughness and ions rejection 55 5 6 membrane performance 5 6 1 effect of transmembrane pressure tmp on permeation flux the pure water permeability has a direct relation with the surface hydrophilicity fig 7 a depicts the effect of tmp on the water permeation flux and pure water permeability of the control membrane and modified membranes were 12 declined difference at 0 5 bar tmp to study the preliminary evaluation of the hydrophilicity of control and c sbf membranes contact angles were also measured as pa csbf4 membrane has a smaller contact angle 46 than control and pa csbf5 membrane this membrane was considered to be more hydrophilic control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 has the permeation flux of 401 444 and 452 l m2h against 0 5 bar tmp respectively c s biocomposite enhances the hydrophilic behavior of modified membranes resulted in enhanced permeation flux 56 furthermore the pa csbf4 membrane was stable that allows the membrane to remain in its integrity as indicated by the permeate flux versus tmp curve 5 6 2 effect of permeation flux on membrane performance fig 7 b c described the effect of permeation flux on the rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions respectively solution diffusion model elucidated the transport mechanism of the membrane which involves three steps 1 sorption at the surface of the membrane 2 diffusion into the membrane and 3 desorption in fig 7 b c it was observed that control membrane has low rejection at high permeation flux compared to modified membranes sorption of water into the membrane was due to the hydrophilic nature of chitosan which acts as driving force 57 in fig 7 b c it was examined that with the increased of permeate flux the removal of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions has increased the increase in rejection in modified membranes was due to the migration of chitosan molecules towards the negative charge of clay layer and formed porous structure 58 addition of peg also augmented the surface porosity and enhanced rejection as peg acts as a pore former this was due to the formation of nanovoids on the surface of the membranes 59 the increased content of the biocomposite nanoparticles in membranes enhances the membrane surface roughness which caused the augmentation in permeability ascertained by afm and sem micrographs in which these particles were dispersed 60 salt rejection also occurred due to electrostatic repulsion known as donnon effect 61 all these aforementioned reasons resulted in the increased rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions in pa csbf4 membrane as indicated in fig 7 b c the pa csbfc4 membrane presents the second highest flux with maximum rejection upto 99 of arsenic and upto 96 of selenium was obtained this change in rejection was due to the development of hydrogen bonding of amine group present on chitosan explained in scheme 1 and helped extensive blending resulted in the maximum exclusion of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se pa csbf5 membrane compromised the salt rejection but giving more water flux compared to pa csbf4 which might be due to the agglomeration and non homogeneous dispersion of clay particles thus resulted in the blocking of pores this also might be attributed in the swelling of the membrane in which polymer chains move further apart resulted in increased in free volume which allows the passage of salts resulting in maximum flux with a decline in rejection 62 hence it was proved that pa csbfc4 membrane was the best removal of ions with low pressure drop and optimum permeable flux compared to control and other modified membranes 5 6 3 effect of time on performance with without regeneration long and short term performance of control and modified membranes were evaluated by determining the variation of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se removal efficiency as a function of time as shown in fig 8 a b c d e f to evaluate membrane performance the predominant indicator is the membrane regeneration ability for this purpose membrane was re filtered with h2so4 hno3 and naoh it was notable that in the absence of regeneration the rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ ions of control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membranes were low 25 93 91 in case of h2so4 35 95 90 in case of hno3 whereas in case of naoh the rejection was 26 94 and 92 within 3 h short time similarly the rejection of se ions of control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membranes was 26 91 90 in case of h2so4 32 96 92 in case of hno3 and 28 91 and 91 in case of naoh after 3 h filtration run this means that pa intercalated biocomposite nanoparticles membrane was capable of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions rejection for a long period the performance of control pa csbfc4 and pa csbfc5 membrane for long term filtration of arsenic and selenium ions were observed by h2so4 hno3 and naoh regenerating eluents in fig 8 a b c the as ⅰⅰⅰ removal efficiency was increased upto 40 97 97 of control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membrane after washing with h2so4 eluent similarly after washing with hno3 eluent the removal efficiency increased upto 39 97 96 of control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membranes whereas using naoh as regenerating eluent the rejection was enhanced upto 42 99 98 of control pa csbf4 and pa csbf5 membranes in every case the maximum sample period was 7 h from above results it was observed that 2 3 reduction of as was obtained in case of h2so4 and hno3 eluent for h2so4 the reduction was associated with formation of complex between sulfate ions and functional groups leaving the as ions in case of hno3 the reduction might be associated with adsorption group complexes and incomplete desorption thus naoh was an efficient regenerating agent for removal of as ions after the long term filtration similarly h2so4 hno3 and naoh eluent was used for se ions rejection and shown in fig 8 d e and f the se ions rejection efficiency in the sample period of 6 h was 33 94 96 for h2so4 eluent 34 98 91 for hno3 and 38 96 95 in the sample period of 7 h after naoh regeneration hence hno3 was an efficient regenerating agent for removal of se ions after the long term filtration rejection of as and se were examined 99 and 98 respectively after long term filtration which proved that pa csbf4 membrane possesses great potential for the removal of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se ions from drinking water 5 6 4 effect of ph on membrane performance the influence of ph on the rejection capacity of control and pa csbf membranes were observed at different ph mediums ph 5 acidic medium ph 7 neutral medium ph 9 basic medium the performance of membranes is changing with solution ph fig 9 a depicted the highest rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ at ph 9 in basic medium followed by a neutral medium in acidic medium the control and modified membranes did not show any significant rejection it was evident from the results that pa csbf4 membrane compared to control and pa csbf5 membranes showed maximum rejection of arsenic in basic medium but in acidic medium the chitosan showed soluble behavior in water due to the presence of primary amine group on chitosan with the capacity of protonation and formation of water soluble substance 63 the effect of ph on arsenic removal was previously studied by aremu lay et al and investigated the removal of as and as v from drinking water by a silica based catalytic media dmi 65 the adsorption kinetic was evaluated at different ph 5 6 7 and 8 5 while the contact time was 6 h several batch tests were conducted and maximum adsorption of as occurred at ph 5 64 in comparison with the study of salazar h et al who investigated pvdf hfp bayerite composite with different aluminum hydroxide filler content for arsenic removal from water pvdf hfp was prepared by solvent casting in dead end cell filtration tests of arsenic standard solution of 100 μg l the arsenic rejection was around 60 after 1 h thus pvdf hfp bayerite composite was found suitable for arsenic removal from water 65 the influence of ph on the rejection of selenium was also examined and from fig 9 b it was clear evident that the same performance was observed for se rejection as was in the case of as ⅰⅰⅰ rejection in basic medium the se rejection was upto 96 performed by the pa csbf4 membrane and decline in rejection was evident in pa csbf5 membrane followed by the neutral medium deprotonation of an amine group and ionization of carboxyl group increased with an increase in solution ph resulting in increased rejection of as ⅰⅰⅰ and se 66 in comparison with the previous study proposed by mishra d who studied and characterized zeolites from deccan trap for the removal of selenium from wastewater the concentration of selenium after the exchange was obtained by microprocessor differential pulse polarography dpp the exchange of selenium was found 92 75 for scolecite while it was 68 for stilbite 67 bleiman n and y g mishael designed and investigated the polymer clay composite to adsorb selenium from water chitosan montmorillonite composite exhibited the highest adsorption efficiency the adsorption by the composite was independent of ph selenium adsorption by the composite from water brought levels below who limit the adsorption was selective for selenium even in the presence of sulfur in comparison with al oxide the adsorption of selenium by composite was higher and readsorption of selenium was also demonstrated in that study 68 5 6 5 effects of coexisting anions and cations on removal of as and se various co anions and cations may affect the removal of as and se from waste water thus the influence of other co anions and cations such as phosphate bicarbonate nitrate chloride and sulfate were tested to understand the effect in as and se adsorption behavior as shown in fig 9 c the most significant effect on as and se removal was exerted by the phosphate with increasing concentration of phosphate as and se removal decreased which can be described to the structural similarities this structural similarity allowed phosphate to compete for the adsorption site on membrane 69 comparatively bicarbonate appeared to influence as and se removal by membranes nitrate and chloride has a little influence on the removal of as and se similarly sulfate did not interfere with the removal of as and se to noticeable extent 70 5 6 6 zeta potential measurement the charge density on membrane surface affected the separation performance i e salt rejection and was characterized by zeta potential fig 9 d exhibited the different zeta potential of control and pa csbf membranes and these values were obtained at various ph ranges of 5 7 and 9 respectively the negative charge surface of control membrane was attributed to the fact of deprotonation of the carboxyl group cooh coo on the polyamide layer 71 the trend of charges on the surface of membranes has changed when modified with chitosan clay nanoparticles the chitosan particles play a prominent role in overall charge property and were observed in fig 9 d the pa csbf 1 5 membranes have increasingly higher charge density with an increase of chitosan clay content the results depicted that pa csbf5 membrane has a higher negatively charged surface compared to pa csbf4 due to less amount of chitosan in ratio the pa csbf4 membrane has optimum charge density compared to control membrane due to the migration of chitosan clay nanoparticles which were negatively charged 72 the enhanced negative charged surfaces hydrophilicity and morphology of the membranes confirmed the hydrogen bonding among novel blended pa csbf membrane as shown in scheme 1 6 conclusion pa blended membranes were prepared adopting two step method via solution casting by varying concentrations of chitosan clay nanoparticles 10 50 mg it was confirmed that with increasing the quantity of c sbf composite the hydrophilic behavior of membranes increased upto pa csbf4 the blending and hydrogen bonding among pa peg and c sbf was confirmed by ftir enhanced surface roughness and pores formation were observed on the membrane surface of pa csbf4 by sem and afm analysis increased in thermal stability profile was observed by tga but the control membrane has lower thermal stability the selective interaction of c sbf composite with pa peg membrane was confirmed by obtaining the permeation flux of 444 l m2h with optimal rejection of 99 and 98 through pa csbf4 membranes than control and other modified membranes moreover membrane has favorable regeneration ability with naoh and hno3 hence it is concluded that solution casting is an effective

14106,membrane bioreactors mbrs have emerged as more sustainable alternatives to conventional water treatment methods due to their lower footprint and higher capacity however biofouling of the membranes results in reduced membrane lifespan thus leading to higher operating costs in this work the synergistic effect of silver decoration on graphene oxide go in polyether sulfone pes membranes was demonstrated to significantly reduce biofouling and enhance other membrane properties the pes membranes containing different amounts 0 00 2 5 wt of silver decorated go ag go were fabricated by a wet phase inversion fabrication method the membrane contact angle was reduced from 67 3 59 for pure pes to 39 2 9 for a ag go pes membrane which is an indication of a significant increase in hydrophilicity the ag go pes membranes became more negatively charged with increasing ag go content reaching 34 3 mv at a concentration of 2 5 wt ag go water flux and rejection were enhanced for the ag go embedded membranes after 20 h of mbr operation permeation of the pure pes membrane stopped completely while the modified ag go pes membranes showed longer resistance against fouling the modified membranes showed great potential to contribute towards higher performance and more sustainable mbr operation keywords graphene oxide nanohybrid membrane hydrophilicity anti biofouling membrane bioreactor the casting solution viscosity 1 introduction the advancement of membrane technology has brought a revolution in water and wastewater treatment processes where it performs substantially better than conventional treatment processes incorporating a membrane separation unit as one of the treatment processes enables the removal of various contaminants from water preventing the issues of environmental pollution 1 3 for the past few decades various types of membrane technology such as ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis forward osmosis and membrane bioreactors mdrs have been introduced and brought to the water utility market 4 as a result of this wide adoption improving the characteristics of commercial membranes and developing new membrane materials have been the focus of membrane researchers in recent years in order to enhance overall membrane performance 1 3 some of the studies on membrane design and fabrication have contributed towards solving the fouling deposition problem which is directly related to the suspended fractions or components in the solutions that are to be filtered 4 biofilm formation however is another possible phenomenon that could become the predominant membrane fouling factor considering that the surface is in contact with water for long durations 5 biofilm formation has been a critical issue in industry for many years owing to the presence of suspended fractions that become a source of nutrients for bacteria especially in processes such as biorefinery 6 forward osmosis 7 reverse osmosis 8 wastewater treatment and mbrs 9 mbrs have been considered a more sustainable option for industrial and domestic wastewater treatments due to the numerous characteristics that it offers when compared to conventional wastewater treatment plants such as the elimination of secondary treatments reduction in space requirements reduction in excess sludge and the high quality of processed water 10 11 mbrs however face the issue of biofouling problems similar to all other bioreactors the complex interactions between the membranes and the activated sludge contribute to the formation of biofilms on membrane surfaces which normally increase significantly their maintenance costs polyether sulfone pes could be one of the ideal polymers to produce membrane for mbr applications owing to its superior physicochemical properties 12 pes membranes however have a high propensity towards fouling and biofouling this phenomenon has been linked to the hydrophobic nature of pes research evidence has proven that the hydrophilic membranes tend to resistant fouling 13 various approaches have been employed to mitigate the biofouling issue in the membrane industry in recent years including surface modifications such as copolymer grafting plasma treatment and surface coating 7 14 15 blending is another effective method that has been adopted to minimise biofouling problems by integrating nanoparticles such as tio2 zno zro2 or biogenic ag into the membrane matrixes 16 17 this method has been reported to be effective in enhancing membrane properties such as reduced fouling tendency increased hydrophilicity increased water flux and increased solute rejection 18 20 blending these nanomaterials directly into the membrane matrixes however induces several challenges such as agglomerations leaching of the nanoparticles from membrane matrixes and complications in direct mixing when high mixing ratios of 10 30 are involved 11 several researchers have recently proved that carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene based materials have similar effects towards enhancing membrane performance these carbon based nanomaterials are required in lower amounts but contribute to additional stability in membrane structures 21 22 polymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 23 25 nylon 6 6 26 poly vinyl alcohol 27 and polysulfone 28 have been reported to exhibit improved mechanical and thermal properties after being embedded with graphene and graphene oxide go graphene oxide forms an attractive area for research as a new generation of novel nanohybrid materials have been produced by researchers around the globe using go these materials are characterised by the synergistic effect of go with various types of nanomaterials decorated or coated on its surface for instance titanium decorated go tio2 go and zinc decorated go zn go have been used to fabricate advanced photo catalytic materials with superior properties 29 30 kumar et al have prepared ag decorated go ag go nanohybrids which showed excellent anti microbial properties through kirby bauer antibiotic strength measurements using escherichia coli 31 silver nanoparticles have been proven to be excellent anti microbial materials 18 owing to the oligodynamic effect of the material ag go has better properties than ag and go in terms of biofilm prevention surface charge plays an important role in biofilm prevention due to the fact that the negatively charged surface can be utilised to repel bacteria electrostatic antibacterial effect 32 the functional groups on the go surface provide the particles with negative charges while ag go is characterised by a synergistic effect between the two materials incorporation of ag go in membrane matrixes has exhibited better performance in comparison to the pure polymeric membranes in terms of anti microbial and fouling mitigation properties 33 34 thus the main objective of this study was to develop characterise and test a novel pes based membrane incorporating ag go for applications in mbr systems the membranes were shown to have significantly improved performance especially for anti biofouling purposes that augurs well for enhancing their potential application in mbr systems thereby making the overall mbr operation more sustainable in terms of more robust performance and reduced operating costs 2 experimental 2 1 materials pure graphite powder 50 μm was

and washed with deionised water after washing to neutral ph and freeze drying go in form of a fine brown was obtained silver nanoparticles were decorated onto go nanoplates by reduction of silver nitrate agno3 using sodium borohydride nabh4 in aqueous go solution 33 36 the ag go was washed and centrifuged 10 times and sent for freeze drying to obtain the ag go in the form of a fine grey powder 2 3 membrane fabrication a phase inversion method was employed for the fabrication of the pes ag go blend membranes the membrane casting solution was prepared by adding the polymer to 80 of the total nmp and kept in a silicon oil bath at an average temperature of 80 c under continuous stirring at 300 rpm for 5 h the remaining nmp was mixed with ag go nanoplates and ultrasonicated for 30 min in a different beaker before stirring overnight this extra step was taken to make sure that all the nanoparticles were dispersed uniformly in the nmp solvent and prevented from agglomeration the nmp solution containing ag go nanoplates was added into the pes nmp mixture to produce a homogenous solution with better dispersion of the nanoplates the casting solution mixture was then ultrasonicated for 1 h before casting the membranes were fabricated using a filmographe doctor blade 360099003 braive instruments germany at a thickness of 0 2 mm and using ultrapure water at room temperature as

obtain a more accurate result raman spectrophotometry at a laser wavelength of 514 nm horiba jobinyvon labram hr800 was used to confirm the presence of ag go samples were fixed onto a glass substrate before focusing the laser beam on the centre of the membrane surface the overall porosity ε can be determined using gravimetric method 37 as defined in eq 1 1 ε ω 1 ω 2 a l d w where ω1 kg is the

synthetic wastewater activated sludge was provided by indah water konsortium sdn bhd malaysia which is the main operator of municipal sewage treatment systems in malaysia details of the composition of

with a standard cod program preloaded in the machine all the readings were repeated for 3 times to reduce the possibility of reading errors 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of membrane casting solution viscosity on membrane properties fig 2 a shows the viscosity of the membrane casting solutions as a function of ag go concentration it is plain that the use of nanoplates as a casting solution additive increased the solution viscosity from 289 94 369 92 cp for m1 and m6 membranes respectively ag go nanoplates are some of the most hydrophilic go family derivatives 31 33 36 41 the addition of hydrophilic ag go nanoplates to the membrane casting solution can interfere with the thermodynamic stability and increase the phase inversion kinetics of the phase inversion process the mass transfer rate between the solvent and non solvent phase increased due to the interference of the hydrophilic nanoplates resulting in the formation of larger pores on the surface of the membranes incorporating ag go fig 2b when 1 of nanoplates was added to the solution however the increase in viscosity overcame the hydrophilicity effect of the nanoplates causing a decrease in mass transfer kinetics between the phases this phenomenon is commonly seen in membrane fabrication as reported by others 42 44 the addition of nanoparticles can contribute to an increase in phase inversion kinetics and subsequently a decrease when the concentration of nanoparticles reaches a certain ratio this can be explained by rheology induced reductions in the solvent and non solvent diffusion 45 46 the effect of this phenomenon can be reflected in a reduction in membranes pore sizes this can be seen with membrane m4 with a concentration of 1 5 and other membranes with higher concentrations this demonstrates that the increase in viscosity had caused a decrease in the kinetics of phase inversion hence the formation of smaller pores 47 3 2 membrane wettability and permeability when water comes into contact with the surface of a polymeric membrane both cohesive and adhesive forces will act on it when a membrane surface is hydrophilic the adhesion force between the water molecules and the membrane surface will attract the molecules towards the surface when water molecules form adhesion bonds with the pore walls of the membranes the cohesive forces between the water molecules draw the water molecules inside the membrane structures these are the same forces that contribute to the osmotic effect in plants a number of authors have reported the increase in pure water flux in membranes possessing high hydrophilicity for the very same reason 48 51 fig 3 b shows the contact angles of the fabricated membranes the addition of ag go reduced the contact angles of membrane surfaces from 67 to 38 for membranes m1 and m6 respectively this was due to the synergistic effect between the ag and the functional groups of the go based on the current study membrane pure water flux increased with an increase in membrane surface contact angle which was due to the increase in adhesion forces as previously explained the increase in phase inversion kinetics on the other hand caused an increase in relative membrane pore sizes which could also affect pure water flux 11 based on the current study pure water flux was reduced when the membranes were modified with 1 5 of ag go membrane m4 and those with higher contents of ag go this can be explained by an increase in the viscosity of the casting solution greater relative pore size and reduced kinetics during the phase inversion process in the presence of high ag go concentrations as previously explained the relative pore sizes of the m3 and m4 membranes were determined to be 12 32 and 9 76 nm respectively the reduction in the relative pore sizes on the surface of these membranes resulted in lower pure water fluxes membrane m6 with 2 5 of ag go appeared to have smaller relative pore size than the pure membrane m1 at 8 3 and 9 5 nm respectively the pure water flux for membrane m6 however was higher than that of membrane m1 due to higher membrane surface hydrophilicity which enhanced the adhesive and cohesive forces of the water molecules this was confirmed by the contact angle of membrane m6 39 2 9 which was much lower than that of membrane m1 67 3 59 the rejection of bsa by the membranes showed that even though there was an increase in the membrane pore size and water flux the rejection showed no significant change the bsa rejection by the membrane with the highest flux showed only 2 decrease fig 3c 3 3 membrane surface properties polymer surface charge modification has proved to be one of the most effective methods of biofilm formation prevention 52 based on electrostatics principles particles with the same charge will repel each other the surface charge of a membrane can be measured in terms of surface zeta potential fig 4 shows the surface zeta potentials of the membranes embedded with different concentrations of ag go based on the analysis there is a direct relationship between the membrane surface charge and the concentration of ag go the membranes became more negatively charged with increasing ag go content reaching 34 3 mv at 2 5 ag go the increase in negative surface potential on the membrane can enhance the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and the synthetic solution which had a negative zeta potential of 3 2 mv this can minimise the attachment of microorganisms to the surface of the membrane it is expected that the ag go membranes can impede the formation of a caking layer of microorganisms thus showing better bio and deposit fouling resistance afm was used to investigate the surface roughness of the fabricated membranes fig 6 shows the 2d and 3d images of the membrane surfaces the addition of hydrophilic ag go during the blending process caused the polymer solution to solidify rapidly at the interface between casting solution and water owing to the increase in phase inversion kinetics unmitigable stresses produced by the shrinkage or syneresis during continuous mass transfer between the two phases led to the formation of fractures in the solidified polymer interface this rapid solidification process contributed to a slight increase in surface roughness of the fabricated membranes with addition of lower ratios of ag go when the concentration of the ag go increased however the phase inversion kinetics decreased along with the surface roughness of the membranes as shown in fig 5 membrane surface roughness is an important parameter in affecting the membrane fouling behaviour in various applications when the membrane surface roughness increased effective membrane filtration area was also increased 53 this can be observed through the high permeate flux of membrane m4 at the beginning of the filtration study high surface roughness and high permeate flux however led to the high accumulation of foulants onto the membrane surface and significantly reduced the permeate flux high fouling rate was observed because the foulants that were deposited onto the rougher membrane surface were subjected to less hydraulic shear force 54 deposition of the foulants can be verified through the sem images of the fouled membrane that will be discussed later 3 4 membrane morphology the cross sectional fesem images of the fabricated membranes are shown in fig 7 all the membranes showed an asymmetric morphology finger like pores linked by sponge walls the findings indicate that the addition of ag go did not affect the overall structural formation of pes membranes 34 however the addition of ag go at a concentration of 2 5 membrane m6 resulted in the formation of macro voids that contributed to the formation of larger but less disrupted channels with denser sub layers cross section of membrane m6 top layer showed the formation of small pores that are well connected to the membrane bottom layer with larger pore diameter the good connectivity of the pores increased the pure water flux of membrane m6 however connectivity between the pores on the membrane top layer and the bottom layer is not well displayed in fig 7 b besides relatively homogeneous pore diameter from top to bottom layer of the membrane based on the cross sectional structure of membrane m4 was displayed in fig 7 d this type of homogeneous structure can lead to poor separation performance which was coincidently in good agreement with rejection study conducted in this work formation of dense structure on membrane top layer in membrane m6 could be due to the addition of 2 5 of ag go changing the casting solution viscosity significantly the reduced de mixing kinetics caused by a dramatic increase in the viscosity of the casting solution could explain the formation of a denser sub layer and the macro void channels having a shorter length through the cross section of membrane m6 this dense sub layer as a result contributes to the lower pure water flux in membrane m6 3 5 investigation of the presence of ag go in membranes the presence of ag go in the structures of fabricated membranes was verified using raman spectroscopy and edx in mapping mode this analysis can be used to study the distribution of ag nanoparticles on the membrane surfaces fig 8 a shows the raman spectra for the membranes m1 and m4 the g band peak at 1598 59 cm 1 represents the cc bond which can arise from both the polymer and the graphene the epoxide and hydroxyl groups on the ag go nanoplates however produced structural imperfections in membrane m4 and caused a d band peak at 1352 83 cm 1 the d band peak confirmed the presence of ag go in the structure of membrane m4 55 57 edx in addition was employed for the detection of ag nanoparticles fig 8 b and c presents the edx spectrum and mapping images of membrane m4 the peaks located at 2 65 and 2 984 prove existence of the elemental ag in the matrixes of the fabricated membranes in order to study the distribution pattern of ag go in the modified membranes edx mapping mode was employed the results illustrated in fig 8c shows a uniform distribution of the ag nanoparticles in the matrix of the m4 membrane indicating that the decoration of ag on the go is an effective method of preventing nanoparticles from agglomeration and helps to achieve an even distribution of the ag nanoparticles in the matrixes of the modified membrane resulting in an enhanced oligodynamic effect across the surface of the membrane that leads to better antibacterial properties and the prevention of biofilm formation 3 6 membrane stability tests as reported by mollahosseini et al 58 and other authors ag nanoparticles have the tendency to leach out from the membrane and are not a very stable nanoparticles in the membrane matrix to test the stability of the ag go plates in the matrix of the membrane and to make sure that they do not leach out after the first filtration ftir and icp ms were used fig 9 shows the ftir spectrum of the permeate of the m6 membrane after 3 30 and 60 min there was no trace of go observed in the permeate water and all showed the standard ftir of pure water with three obvious peaks at 647 1652 and 3396 cm 1 which results are in agreement with earlier work 59 icp ms was conducted on the permeate to test whether any trace of ag ions could be detected there was no trace of ag detected in the permeate in agreement with the ftir analysis in conclusion the decoration of ago on the surface of the graphene has made the ag stable in the membrane structure 3 7 membrane performance testing in mbr system the fouling of the fabricated membranes was quantified by measuring flux decline at constant suction pressure in the mbr system fig 1 the mbr was filled with synthetic wastewater supplementary table s1 shows the details of the composition the zeta potential of the synthetic wastewater at room temperature was determined to be 23 2 mv as reported by hong et al 60 increasing the vacuum pressure has a direct impact on the decline in permeate flux hence the aim of the study was to measure the antifouling biofouling and life span of the modified membranes in the mbr thus the impact of continuous filtration under the vacuum pressure of 0 6 bars was investigated fig 10 a shows the flux decline profiles of the fabricated membranes it is worth noting that the filtration conditions and airflow rate 8 l min for all the membranes were constant all the modified membranes m2 m6 in this study showed higher fluxes in comparison to the unmodified membrane m1 it can be observed that the water flux decreased sharply at the start of filtration after 2 3 h of operation however the permeations of the solutions reached steady states the flux decreases of the membranes can be explained by two different mechanisms short term pore blocking or cake layer formation and long term irreversible biofouling of the membranes in general it can be observed that the short term flux decreases have a direct relationship with the pore sizes of the membranes the unmodified membrane m1 reached its steady flux after almost 80 min the flux decline however continued throughout the experiment up to the point where after 20 h the flux faced a complete stop membrane m2 showed almost identical behaviour to that of membrane m3 starting with maximum fluxes of 78 and 92 l h respectively with a sharp decline to almost 50 l hr after 20 h the water fluxes declined to almost 15 l h for both membranes this flux drop could be explained by both cake layer formation or pore clogging and biofilm formation on the surface of the membranes membranes m2 and m3 had the largest relative pore sizes of the fabricated membranes at 10 7 and 12 3 nm respectively from the results it can be concluded that the rate of initial flux decline increased with increasing relative pore size of the membranes membrane m4 showed a different behaviour in reaching a steady state after almost 3 h this flux decline profile gave membrane m4 a noticeable life span in comparison to membrane m1 which showed a sharp flux drop that could be due to pore blocking and cake formation the steady flux in membrane m4 could be due to the surface zeta potential which was noticeably higher 26 mv and its contact angle which was much smaller in comparison to those of m1 and m3 refer to the results for zeta potential and contact angle membranes m5 and m6 reached their steady states after almost 60 min and showed similar behaviour to membrane m4 membranes m5 and m6 showed very low flux decline after 20 h of filtration fig 10b shows the total permeate flux of the membranes under the same operational conditions there was an obvious improvement in all of the ag go embedded membranes higher permeation was due to two different factors namely hydrophilicity of the membranes and lower fouling tendency of the modified membranes ag go mixed matrix membranes have the ability to mitigate or prevent biofouling this phenomenon has been investigated and reported by several authors 33 34 61 fesem images of the membrane surface after filtration fig 11 reveal the ability of the ag go mixed membranes to reduce and prevent both biofilm formation and cake formation on the surface of the membranes fig 11 a shows the surface of the membrane m1 after 20 h of continuous filtration and indicates that the biofilm had completely covered the surface of the membrane to the extent that the polymeric surface was not clearly visible in fesem scanning this severe biofouling explained the sharp flux decline and the rapid complete stopping of the water flux by that membrane results showed that a higher content of ag go in a membrane can enhance its resistance towards biofouling membrane m4 showed no biofilm formation on the surface although some microorganisms were detected on the surface the ability to reproduce and form a biofilm was mitigated in this membrane even more significant was the remarkable reduction in the number microorganisms attached to the surface of membrane m6 these enhancements were due to the synergistic antibacterial effect of ag go the hydroxyl epoxide carbonyl and carboxyl groups of the go resulted in a negatively charged surface surface charge plays a big role in repulsing negatively charged bacteria electrostatic repulsion combined with the oligodynamic effect of ag decoration on the go resulted in a superior membrane material leading to enhanced antifouling properties hydrophilicity permeate flux and cod removal in the mbr fig 12 shows the cod removal of the fabricated membrane all membranes showed cod removals higher than 95 on the other hand rejections illustrated in fig 12 were enhanced by 4 despite the fact that the addition of go nanoplates increased the water flux and enlarged the pores of the modified membranes the hydrophilicity of the membrane could be one of the factors contributing to this phenomenon as a highly hydrophilic membrane structure lowers the hydraulic resistance enhancing the affinity of the modified membranes towards water molecules rather than the foulants hence the change in pore size and flux does not dramatically affect the rejection by the modified membranes additionally most organic foulants show a higher affinity towards hydrophobic materials as a result membranes with higher hydrophilicity show higher cod removal 4 conclusion pes based hybrid membranes were embedded with ag go edx mapping results showed that the ag go nanoplates could be densely and uniformly dispersed in the membrane matrix addition of ag go to the membrane casting solution changed its viscosity as a result denser sub layers and pores of smaller relative size were formed the mixed matrix membrane showed superior properties including in pure water flux porosity and hydrophilicity higher more stable flux was obtained for the mbr system electrostatic repulsion combined with the oligodynamic effect of the ag nanoparticles resulted in superior membrane materials with anti biofouling capability hence pes ag go membranes have emerged as potential candidates to solve the common issues of mbr systems owing to their enhanced properties in terms of hydrophilicity antifouling and anti biofouling effects thereby leading to

14106,membrane bioreactors mbrs have emerged as more sustainable alternatives to conventional water treatment methods due to their lower footprint and higher capacity however biofouling of the membranes results in reduced membrane lifespan thus leading to higher operating costs in this work the synergistic effect of silver decoration on graphene oxide go in polyether sulfone pes membranes was demonstrated to significantly reduce biofouling and enhance other membrane properties the pes membranes containing different amounts 0 00 2 5 wt of silver decorated go ag go were fabricated by a wet phase inversion fabrication method the membrane contact angle was reduced from 67 3 59 for pure pes to 39 2 9 for a ag go pes membrane which is an indication of a significant increase in hydrophilicity the ag go pes membranes became more negatively charged with increasing ag go content reaching 34 3 mv at a concentration of 2 5 wt ag go water flux and rejection were enhanced for the ag go embedded membranes after 20 h of mbr operation permeation of the pure pes membrane stopped completely while the modified ag go pes membranes showed longer resistance against fouling the modified membranes showed great potential to contribute towards higher performance and more sustainable mbr operation keywords graphene oxide nanohybrid membrane hydrophilicity anti biofouling membrane bioreactor the casting solution viscosity 1 introduction the advancement of membrane technology has brought a revolution in water and wastewater treatment processes where it performs substantially better than conventional treatment processes incorporating a membrane separation unit as one of the treatment processes enables the removal of various contaminants from water preventing the issues of environmental pollution 1 3 for the past few decades various types of membrane technology such as ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis forward osmosis and membrane bioreactors mdrs have been introduced and brought to the water utility market 4 as a result of this wide adoption improving the characteristics of commercial membranes and developing new membrane materials have been the focus of membrane researchers in recent years in order to enhance overall membrane performance 1 3 some of the studies on membrane design and fabrication have contributed towards solving the fouling deposition problem which is directly related to the suspended fractions or components in the solutions that are to be filtered 4 biofilm formation however is another possible phenomenon that could become the predominant membrane fouling factor considering that the surface is in contact with water for long durations 5 biofilm formation has been a critical issue in industry for many years owing to the presence of suspended fractions that become a source of nutrients for bacteria especially in processes such as biorefinery 6 forward osmosis 7 reverse osmosis 8 wastewater treatment and mbrs 9 mbrs have been considered a more sustainable option for industrial and domestic wastewater treatments due to the numerous characteristics that it offers when compared to conventional wastewater treatment plants such as the elimination of secondary treatments reduction in space requirements reduction in excess sludge and the high quality of processed water 10 11 mbrs however face the issue of biofouling problems similar to all other bioreactors the complex interactions between the membranes and the activated sludge contribute to the formation of biofilms on membrane surfaces which normally increase significantly their maintenance costs polyether sulfone pes could be one of the ideal polymers to produce membrane for mbr applications owing to its superior physicochemical properties 12 pes membranes however have a high propensity towards fouling and biofouling this phenomenon has been linked to the hydrophobic nature of pes research evidence has proven that the hydrophilic membranes tend to resistant fouling 13 various approaches have been employed to mitigate the biofouling issue in the membrane industry in recent years including surface modifications such as copolymer grafting plasma treatment and surface coating 7 14 15 blending is another effective method that has been adopted to minimise biofouling problems by integrating nanoparticles such as tio2 zno zro2 or biogenic ag into the membrane matrixes 16 17 this method has been reported to be effective in enhancing membrane properties such as reduced fouling tendency increased hydrophilicity increased water flux and increased solute rejection 18 20 blending these nanomaterials directly into the membrane matrixes however induces several challenges such as agglomerations leaching of the nanoparticles from membrane matrixes and complications in direct mixing when high mixing ratios of 10 30 are involved 11 several researchers have recently proved that carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene based materials have similar effects towards enhancing membrane performance these carbon based nanomaterials are required in lower amounts but contribute to additional stability in membrane structures 21 22 polymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 23 25 nylon 6 6 26 poly vinyl alcohol 27 and polysulfone 28 have been reported to exhibit improved mechanical and thermal properties after being embedded with graphene and graphene oxide go graphene oxide forms an attractive area for research as a new generation of novel nanohybrid materials have been produced by researchers around the globe using go these materials are characterised by the synergistic effect of go with various types of nanomaterials decorated or coated on its surface for instance titanium decorated go tio2 go and zinc decorated go zn go have been used to fabricate advanced photo catalytic materials with superior properties 29 30 kumar et al have prepared ag decorated go ag go nanohybrids which showed excellent anti microbial properties through kirby bauer antibiotic strength measurements using escherichia coli 31 silver nanoparticles have been proven to be excellent anti microbial materials 18 owing to the oligodynamic effect of the material ag go has better properties than ag and go in terms of biofilm prevention surface charge plays an important role in biofilm prevention due to the fact that the negatively charged surface can be utilised to repel bacteria electrostatic antibacterial effect 32 the functional groups on the go surface provide the particles with negative charges while ag go is characterised by a synergistic effect between the two materials incorporation of ag go in membrane matrixes has exhibited better performance in comparison to the pure polymeric membranes in terms of anti microbial and fouling mitigation properties 33 34 thus the main objective of this study was to develop characterise and test a novel pes based membrane incorporating ag go for applications in mbr systems the membranes were shown to have significantly improved performance especially for anti biofouling purposes that augurs well for enhancing their potential application in mbr systems thereby making the overall mbr operation more sustainable in terms of more robust performance and reduced operating costs 2 experimental 2 1 materials pure graphite powder 50 μm was

nmp and kept in a silicon oil bath at an average temperature of 80 c under continuous stirring at 300 rpm for 5 h the remaining nmp was mixed with ag go nanoplates and ultrasonicated for 30 min in a different beaker before stirring overnight this extra step was taken to make sure that all the nanoparticles were dispersed uniformly in the nmp solvent and prevented from agglomeration the nmp solution containing ag go nanoplates was added into the pes nmp mixture to produce a homogenous solution with better dispersion of the nanoplates the casting solution mixture was then ultrasonicated

with a standard cod program preloaded in the machine all the readings were repeated for 3 times to reduce the possibility of reading errors 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of membrane casting solution viscosity on membrane properties fig 2 a shows the viscosity of the membrane casting solutions as a function of ag go concentration it is plain that the use of nanoplates as a casting solution additive increased the solution viscosity from 289 94 369 92 cp for m1 and m6 membranes respectively ag go nanoplates are some of the most hydrophilic go family derivatives 31 33 36 41 the addition of hydrophilic ag go nanoplates to the membrane casting solution can interfere with the thermodynamic stability and increase the phase inversion kinetics of the phase inversion process the mass transfer rate between the solvent and non solvent phase increased due to the interference of the hydrophilic nanoplates resulting in the formation of larger pores on the surface of the membranes incorporating ag go fig 2b when 1 of nanoplates was added to the solution however the increase in viscosity overcame the hydrophilicity effect of the nanoplates causing a decrease in mass transfer kinetics between the phases this phenomenon is commonly seen in membrane fabrication as reported by others 42 44 the addition of nanoparticles can contribute to an increase in phase inversion kinetics and subsequently a decrease when the concentration of nanoparticles reaches a certain ratio this can be explained by rheology induced reductions in the solvent and non solvent diffusion 45 46 the effect of this phenomenon can be reflected in a reduction in membranes pore sizes this can be seen with membrane m4 with a concentration of 1 5 and other membranes with higher concentrations this demonstrates that the increase in viscosity had caused a decrease in the kinetics of phase inversion hence the formation of smaller pores 47 3 2 membrane wettability and permeability when water comes into contact with the surface of a polymeric membrane both cohesive and adhesive forces will act on it when a membrane surface is hydrophilic the adhesion force between the water molecules and the membrane surface will attract the molecules towards the surface when water molecules form adhesion bonds with the pore walls of the membranes the cohesive forces between the water molecules draw the water molecules inside the membrane structures these are the same forces that contribute to the osmotic effect in plants a number of authors have reported the increase in pure water flux in membranes possessing high hydrophilicity for the very same reason 48 51 fig 3 b shows the contact angles of the fabricated membranes the addition of ag go reduced the contact angles of membrane surfaces from 67 to 38 for membranes m1 and m6 respectively this was due to the synergistic effect between the ag and the functional groups of the go based on the current study membrane pure water flux increased with an increase in membrane surface contact angle which was due to the increase in adhesion forces as previously explained the increase in phase inversion kinetics on the other hand caused an increase in relative membrane pore sizes which could also affect pure water flux 11 based on the current study pure water flux was reduced when the membranes were modified with 1 5 of ag go membrane m4 and those with higher contents of ag go this can be explained by an increase in the viscosity of the casting solution greater relative pore size and reduced kinetics during the phase inversion process in the presence of high ag go concentrations as previously explained the relative pore sizes of the m3 and m4 membranes were determined to be 12 32 and 9 76 nm respectively the reduction in the relative pore sizes on the surface of these membranes resulted in lower pure water fluxes membrane m6 with 2 5 of ag go appeared to have smaller relative pore size than the pure membrane m1 at 8 3 and 9 5 nm respectively the pure water flux for membrane m6 however was higher than that of membrane m1 due to higher membrane surface hydrophilicity which enhanced the adhesive and cohesive forces of the water molecules this was confirmed by the contact angle of membrane m6 39 2 9 which was much lower than that of membrane m1 67 3 59 the rejection of bsa by the membranes showed that even though there was an increase in the membrane pore size and water flux the rejection showed no significant change the bsa rejection by the membrane with the highest flux showed only 2 decrease fig 3c 3 3 membrane surface properties polymer surface charge modification has proved to be one of the most effective methods of biofilm formation prevention 52 based on electrostatics principles particles with the same charge will repel each other the surface charge of a membrane can be measured in terms of surface zeta potential fig 4 shows the surface zeta potentials of the membranes embedded with different concentrations of ag go based on the analysis there is a direct relationship between the membrane surface charge and the concentration of ag go the membranes became more negatively charged with increasing ag go content reaching 34 3 mv at 2 5 ag go the increase in negative surface potential on the membrane can enhance the electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and the synthetic solution which had a negative zeta potential of 3 2 mv this can minimise the attachment of microorganisms to the surface of the membrane it is expected that the ag go membranes can impede the formation of a caking layer of microorganisms thus showing better bio and deposit fouling resistance afm was used to investigate the surface roughness of the fabricated membranes fig 6 shows the 2d and 3d images of the membrane surfaces the addition of hydrophilic ag go during the blending process caused the polymer solution to solidify rapidly at the interface between casting solution and water owing to the increase in phase inversion kinetics unmitigable stresses produced by the shrinkage or syneresis during continuous mass transfer between the two phases led to the formation of fractures in the solidified polymer interface this rapid solidification process contributed to a slight increase in surface roughness of the fabricated membranes with addition of lower ratios of ag go when the concentration of the ag go increased however the phase inversion kinetics decreased along with the surface roughness of the membranes as shown in fig 5 membrane surface roughness is an important parameter in affecting the membrane fouling behaviour in various applications when the membrane surface roughness increased effective membrane filtration area was also increased 53 this can be observed through the high permeate flux of membrane m4 at the beginning of the filtration study high surface roughness and high permeate flux however led to the high accumulation of foulants onto the membrane surface and significantly reduced the permeate flux high fouling rate was observed because the foulants that were deposited onto the rougher membrane surface were subjected to less hydraulic shear force 54 deposition of the foulants can be verified through the sem images of the fouled membrane that will be discussed later 3 4 membrane morphology the cross sectional fesem images of the fabricated membranes are shown in fig 7 all the membranes showed an asymmetric morphology finger like pores linked by sponge walls the findings indicate that the addition of ag go did not affect the overall structural formation of pes membranes 34 however the addition of ag go at a concentration of 2 5 membrane m6 resulted in the formation of macro voids that contributed to the formation of larger but less disrupted channels with denser sub layers cross section of membrane m6 top layer showed the formation of small pores that are well connected to the membrane bottom layer with larger pore diameter the good connectivity of the pores increased the pure water flux of membrane m6 however connectivity between the pores on the membrane top layer and the bottom layer is not well displayed in fig 7 b besides relatively homogeneous pore diameter from top to bottom layer of the membrane based on the cross sectional structure of membrane m4 was displayed in fig 7 d this type of homogeneous structure can lead to poor separation performance which was coincidently in good agreement with rejection study conducted in this work formation of dense structure on membrane top layer in membrane m6 could be due to the addition of 2 5 of ag go changing the casting solution viscosity significantly the reduced de mixing kinetics caused by a dramatic increase in the viscosity of the casting solution could explain the formation of a denser sub layer and the macro void channels having a shorter length through the cross section of membrane m6 this dense sub layer as a result contributes to the lower pure water flux in membrane m6 3 5 investigation of the presence of ag go in membranes the presence of ag go in the structures of fabricated membranes was verified using raman spectroscopy and edx in mapping mode this analysis can be used to study the distribution of ag nanoparticles on the membrane surfaces fig 8 a shows the raman spectra for the membranes m1 and m4 the g band peak at 1598 59 cm 1 represents the cc bond which can arise from both the polymer and the graphene the epoxide and hydroxyl groups on the ag go nanoplates however produced structural imperfections in membrane m4 and caused a d band peak at 1352 83 cm 1 the d band peak confirmed the presence of ag go in the structure of membrane m4 55 57 edx in addition was employed for the detection of ag nanoparticles fig 8 b and c presents the edx spectrum and mapping images of membrane m4 the peaks located at 2 65 and 2 984 prove existence of the elemental ag in the matrixes of the fabricated membranes in order to study the distribution pattern of ag go in the modified membranes edx mapping mode was employed the results illustrated in fig 8c shows a uniform distribution of the ag nanoparticles in the matrix of the m4 membrane indicating that the decoration of ag on the go is an effective method of preventing nanoparticles from agglomeration and helps to achieve an even distribution of the ag nanoparticles in the matrixes of the modified membrane resulting in an enhanced oligodynamic effect across the surface of the membrane that leads to better antibacterial properties and the prevention of biofilm formation 3 6 membrane stability tests as reported by mollahosseini et al 58 and other authors ag nanoparticles have the tendency to leach out from the membrane and are not a very stable nanoparticles in the membrane matrix to test the stability of the ag go plates in the matrix of the membrane and to make sure that they do not leach out after the first filtration ftir and icp ms were used fig 9 shows the ftir spectrum of the permeate of the m6 membrane after 3 30 and 60 min there was no trace of go observed in the permeate water and all showed the standard ftir of pure water with three obvious peaks at 647 1652 and 3396 cm 1 which results are in agreement with earlier work 59 icp ms was conducted on the permeate to test whether any trace of ag ions could be detected there was no trace of ag detected in the permeate in agreement with the ftir analysis in conclusion the decoration of ago on the surface of the graphene has made the ag stable in the membrane structure 3 7 membrane performance testing in mbr system the fouling of the fabricated membranes was quantified by measuring flux decline at constant suction pressure in the mbr system fig 1 the mbr was filled with synthetic wastewater supplementary table s1 shows the details of the composition the zeta potential of the synthetic wastewater at room temperature was determined to be 23 2 mv as reported by hong et al 60 increasing the vacuum pressure has a direct impact on the decline in permeate flux hence the aim of the study was to measure the antifouling biofouling and life span of the modified membranes in the mbr thus the impact of continuous filtration under the vacuum pressure of 0 6 bars was investigated fig 10 a shows the flux decline profiles of the fabricated membranes it is worth noting that the filtration conditions and airflow rate 8 l min for all the membranes were constant all the modified membranes m2 m6 in this study showed higher fluxes in comparison to the unmodified membrane m1 it can be observed that the water flux decreased sharply at the start of filtration after 2 3 h of operation however the permeations of the solutions reached steady states the flux decreases of the membranes can be explained by two different mechanisms short term pore blocking or cake layer formation and long term irreversible biofouling of the membranes in general it can be observed that the short term flux decreases have a direct relationship with the pore sizes of the membranes the unmodified membrane m1 reached its steady flux after almost 80 min the flux decline however continued throughout the experiment up to the point where after 20 h the flux faced a complete stop membrane m2 showed almost identical behaviour to that of membrane m3 starting with maximum fluxes of 78 and 92 l h respectively with a sharp decline to almost 50 l hr after 20 h the water fluxes declined to almost 15 l h for both membranes this flux drop could be explained by both cake layer formation or pore clogging and biofilm formation on the surface of the membranes membranes m2 and m3 had the largest relative pore sizes of the fabricated membranes at 10 7 and 12 3 nm respectively from the results it can be concluded that the rate of initial flux decline increased with increasing relative pore size of the membranes membrane m4 showed a different behaviour in reaching a steady state after almost 3 h this flux decline profile gave membrane m4 a noticeable life span in comparison to membrane m1 which showed a sharp flux drop that could be due to pore blocking and cake formation the steady flux in membrane m4 could be due to the surface zeta potential which was noticeably higher 26 mv and its contact angle which was much smaller in comparison to those of m1 and m3 refer to the results for zeta potential and contact angle membranes m5 and m6 reached their steady states after almost 60 min and showed similar behaviour to membrane m4 membranes m5 and m6 showed very low flux decline after 20 h of filtration fig 10b shows the total permeate flux of the membranes under the same operational conditions there was an obvious improvement in all of the ag go embedded membranes higher permeation was due to two different factors namely hydrophilicity of the membranes and lower fouling tendency of the modified membranes ag go mixed matrix membranes have the ability to mitigate or prevent biofouling this phenomenon has been investigated and reported by several authors 33 34 61 fesem images of the membrane surface after filtration fig 11 reveal the ability of the ag go mixed membranes to reduce and prevent both biofilm formation and cake formation on the surface of the membranes fig 11 a shows the surface of the membrane m1 after 20 h of continuous filtration and indicates that the biofilm had completely covered the surface of the membrane to the extent that the polymeric surface was not clearly visible in fesem scanning this severe biofouling explained the sharp flux decline and the rapid complete stopping of the water flux by that membrane results showed that a higher content of ag go in a membrane can enhance its resistance towards biofouling membrane m4 showed no biofilm formation on the surface although some microorganisms were detected on the surface the ability to reproduce and form a biofilm was mitigated in this membrane even more significant was the remarkable reduction in the number microorganisms attached to the surface of membrane m6 these enhancements were due to the synergistic antibacterial effect of ag go the hydroxyl epoxide carbonyl and carboxyl groups of the go resulted in a negatively charged surface surface charge plays a big role in repulsing negatively charged bacteria electrostatic repulsion combined with the oligodynamic effect of ag decoration on the go resulted in a superior membrane material leading to enhanced antifouling properties hydrophilicity permeate flux and cod removal in the mbr fig 12 shows the cod removal of the fabricated membrane all membranes showed cod removals higher than 95 on the other hand rejections illustrated in fig 12 were enhanced by 4 despite the fact that the addition of go nanoplates increased the water flux and enlarged the pores of the modified membranes the hydrophilicity of the membrane could be one of the factors contributing to this phenomenon as a highly hydrophilic membrane structure lowers the hydraulic resistance enhancing the affinity of the modified membranes towards water molecules rather than the foulants hence the change in pore size and flux does not dramatically affect the rejection by the modified membranes additionally most organic foulants show a higher affinity towards hydrophobic materials as a result membranes with higher hydrophilicity show higher cod removal 4 conclusion pes based hybrid membranes were embedded with ag go edx mapping results showed that the ag go nanoplates could be densely and uniformly dispersed in the membrane matrix addition of ag go to the membrane casting solution changed its viscosity as a result denser sub layers and pores of smaller relative size were formed the mixed matrix membrane showed superior properties including in pure water flux porosity and hydrophilicity higher more stable flux was obtained for the mbr system electrostatic repulsion combined with the oligodynamic effect of the ag nanoparticles resulted in superior membrane materials with anti biofouling capability hence pes ag go membranes have emerged as potential candidates to solve the common issues of mbr systems owing to their enhanced properties in terms of hydrophilicity antifouling and anti biofouling effects thereby leading to

60 c mesophilic 27 37 c and psychrophilic 7 25 c temperature ranges 1 operating anmbrs under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions when the temperature of the waste stream is in the psychrophilic range increases the operating costs and prevents the industrial application of anmbr technology operating anaerobic processes at low temperatures slows down the biomass growth rate and hinders the hydrolysis reactions 2 3 anmbrs provide a solution for the problems mentioned above by allowing long solids retention times srts while operating at shorter hrts long srts offer adequate time for the growth of microorganisms and hydrolysis of particulate colloidal organics during operation at low temperatures however the operation of anmbrs at psychrophilic temperature conditions is still challenging in a critical review published by smith et al 4 only a few researchers 5 7 operated their anmbrs under psychrophilic conditions of 20 c 11 c and 15 c dvořák et al 8 in a recent review paper have listed lab scale pilot scale and full scale anmbrs treating real wastewaters from the slaughterhouse dairy manure molasses food and bamboo industries most real wastewater treatment studies cited by dvořák et al 8 were operated at 26 38 c and only martinez sosa et al 3 operated their anmbr at 20 c for 21 days table 1 shows recent studies 2013 2018 on anmbrs operated at a psychrophilic range of 25 c and below most studies cited in table 1 have treated synthetic municipal wastewater 9 14 among these studies smith et al 9 gouveia et al 15 16 and huang et al 17 evaluated the treatment of real municipal wastewater using anmbrs under psychrophilic temperature conditions of below 20 c besides only huang et al 17 treated real industrial wastewater pharmaceutical industry in psychrophilic range of 10 22 5 c as explained in the preceding paragraphs limited studies reported the application of anmbrs for treating real industrial wastewaters at the psychrophilic temperature range of 20 c and below moreover based on our literature review application of anmbr technology for malting wastewater treatment at psychrophilic conditions has not been reported malting wastewater has medium to high cod concentration 82 87 soluble cod and high nutrient n and p content and it doesn t need nutrients addition for anaerobic treatment therefore malting wastewater is more promising for biogas production via anaerobic process under psychrophilic temperature conditions compared with municipal wastewater hence the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of long term operation of a submerged anmbr sanmbr for treating malting wastewater and energy recovery under psychrophilic temperature conditions we studied the anmbr operation at psychrophilic conditions because the annual mean temperature of malting wastewater in canada varies between 14 18 c based on a local malting plant data shorter hrts increase the possibility of implementing the anmbrs in full scale plants 18 therefore the hrt was decreased during various periods of the study and the impact of changing the hrt on the anmbr performance was evaluated also the performance of the membrane was investigated by measuring its flux and transmembrane pressure tmp besides the permeability recovery tests the scanning electron microscope sem images and the energy dispersive x ray edx spectra were used to characterize membrane fouling furthermore the response of the microbial community to the temperature and hrt changes as well as the progress of the process was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 the bioreactor configuration inoculation operational parameters and influent characteristics a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr coupled with a submerged flat sheet ultrafiltration membrane unit material pvdf pore size 0 1 μm area 0 030 m² was used for the psychrophilic treatment of malting wastewater fig 1 shows the sanmbr setup the water bath in our previous studies 20 21 was replaced by a chiller in the current set up the detailed operation of the sanmbr setup has been explained elsewhere 20 the seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic brewery wastewater treatment plant guelph canada during the start up period the bioreactor was operated at 35 c for 32 days then the sanmbr temperature was gradually reduced by varying the chiller s temperature the sanmbr temperature was 21 1 c during periods 1 and 2 then it was decreased to 18 1 c for periods 3 4 and 5 the bioreactor was operated continuously for 370 days to assess the long term treatment efficiency of the sanmbr at psychrophilic temperature biogas sparging 4 0 l min and intermittent 3 min work 2 min rest for permeate pump were applied to control the membrane fouling table 2 describes the operational conditions of the bioreactor under psychrophilic temperature conditions the optimal ph for anaerobic digestion is between 6 8 and 7 5 1 sodium hydroxide was added to the influent tank to keep the ph of the bioreactor at 7 4 0 1 during the experiment the hrt of each period was controlled by adjusting the membrane permeate flux the flow rate of influent was equal to the flow rate of effluent because the reactor effective volume was kept constant the wastewater samples used in this study were taken from the steeping step of a local malting plant table 3 presents the characteristics of malting wastewater samples measured during this study malting wastewater consisted of 87 soluble cod and contained essential nutrients for anaerobic treatment 2 2 sampling and analysis the influent mixed liquor effluent and biogas samples were collected and analyzed periodically all sample analyses including cod bod₅ biological oxygen demand mlss mixed liquor suspended solids psd particle size distribution nutrients n and p and metal ions concentrations were conducted following maleki et al 20 sludge was not wasted except for sampling which resulted in long srts of 720 727 846 862 and 546 days for periods 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively also the average mlss concentration during periods 1 2 3 4 and 5 was 21 1 g l 19 4 g l 18 1 g l 17 9 g l and 17 5 g l respectively the biogas yield and production rate were adapted to the standard temperature and pressure stp of 0 c and 1 atm at the end of period 4 the membrane could not sustain the targeted flux hence on day 326 the bioreactor was opened and the fouled membrane was taken out then a new membrane was placed in the bioreactor and the system was purged with n₂ and the anmbr operation was resumed the fouled membrane was sent for physical chemical cleanings and permeability recovery tests the cleaning procedure was performed following maleki et al 20 physical cleaning with a wet sponge followed by rinsing with tap water was applied to remove the cake layer of the fouled membrane next the membrane was submerged in 200 ppm naclo solution for 2 h followed by rinsing with tap water to remove organic fouling then the membrane was immersed in 2000 ppm citric acid solution for 2 h and rinsined with tap water to remove inorganic fouling the membrane permeability recovery tests were performed after each cleaning step by measuring the tmp of membrane for a range of clean water fluxes following maleki et al 20 afterward the membrane samples were prepared for the morphology and elemental composition analysis based on maleki et al 20 an energy dispersive spectrometer with a scanning electron microscope sem edx hitachi su 70 was used to study the morphological and elemental composition of the membrane samples 2 3 microbial community analysis in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge first dnas are extracted from samples then the extracted dnas are amplified using the polymerase chain reaction pcr afterward the pcr products amplified dnas are run along a gradient gel the gel contains a gradient of a dna denaturant chemical mixture such as urea and formamide electrophoresis of denaturing gradient gel separates dna fragments due to their different melting denaturing properties 22 each band in dgge image corresponds to a phylotype 23 or an operational taxonomic unit out and the fingerprints formed reflects the community diversity 24 the mixed liquor samples for dna extraction were prepared according to maleki et al 21 the dnas of the samples were extracted using the quick dna fecal soil microbe miniprep kit zymo research catalog d6010 following the instructions provided by the manufacturer the primer set was 341 f gc 5 gc clamp cctagggaggcagcag 3 and 534 r 5 attaccgcggctgctgg 3 eurofins genomics the pcr amplification was done according to maleki et al 21 gradient former bio rad model 475 was used to prepare 16 cm 16 cm 1 mm polyacrylamide gels the 25 and 65 denaturant gradient gels were made according to lin et al 25 the amplified dna samples pcr products were loaded in the wells of one gel and the analysis was duplicated electrophoresis gel staining and image acquiring were done following maleki et al 21 bionumerics 7 6 26 was employed for the cluster analysis of the dgge images as stated by maleki et al 21 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical significance of the experimental data was evaluated by the one way analysis of variance anova with significance of 95 p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of the sanmbr 3 1 1 organic removals in sanmbr fig 2 represents hrt olr organic loading rate and biogas production rate during this study the hrt was decreased from 4 6 1 1 days in the start up period to 1 5 0 1 days in period 5 by adjusting the permeate flux as a result the olr varied between 1 0 0 2 kg cod m³ d start up period and 2 1 0 2 kg cod m³ d period 5 see table 2 as fig 2 shows decreasing the hrt did not change the olr significantly because the influent cod was not constant and it fluctuated during the experiment the influent used in this study was real malting wastewater which its cod varied for different batches the cod of malting wastewater is affected by various factors such as the variety and growth conditions of barley 27 as well as the batch wise nature of the steeping process in this study the olr varied between 1 4 0 1 kg cod m³ d in period 1 and 2 1 0 2 kg cod m³ d in period 5 which is less than olr of 3 6 kg cod m³ d reported by borzacconi et al 28 in a full scale uasb reactor treating malting wastewater at 17 25 c this is because olr in anmbrs is limited by the size of the anmbr and the membrane critical flux higher olrs could be achieved by optimizing the configuration and operating conditions of the anmbr 20 for example the integration of an uasb with an anaerobic membrane filtration tank could create an uasb anmbr system that combines the advantages of uasb high rate and membrane filtration high quality effluent and prevention of sludge washout for wastewater treatment at 21 1 c shortening the hrt did not impact the biogas production rate much because the olr did not change significantly due to a lower influent cod concentration see table 2 however at 18 1 c the biogas production rate increased from 1 12 0 20 l d in period 3 to 2 89 0 40 l d in period 5 as the hrt decreased from 3 2 days to 1 5 days this is because by reducing the hrt the olr increased from 1 2 kg cod m³ d in period 3 to 2 1 kg cod m³ d in period 5 the influent supernatant and effluent cods and the sanmbr s removal efficiencies are depicted in fig 3 the influent cod varied significantly during this study because as stated earlier the influent was real malting wastewater and its cod was not steady as the experiment proceeded and the hrt decreased the supernatant cod gradually decreased from 2258 416 mg l in period 1 to 1454 276 mg l in period 5 see table 4 conversely jeong et al 29 observed an increase in the cod concentrations in the bioreactor with decreasing hrt the decreasing pattern of supernatant cod in this study is in agreement with our observation during room temperature study 21 but different from the mesophilic treatment study 20 the decrease of the supernatant cod as the process progressed might be due to the decline of the influent cod from 4332 179 mg l in period 1 to 3238 384 mg l in period 5 also it might be because operating at prolonged srts provided enough time for the adjustment of the biomass to temperature 11 which as a result enhanced the hydrolysis of particulates and colloids another possible reason could be decline of biomass decay at shorter hrts because at short hrts starvation decreases and as a result microorganisms generate less smp this may occur when the wastewater is highly biodegradable the effluent cod values in periods 1 and 2 21 1 c were higher than that of periods 3 4 and 5 18 1 c see table 4 at temperature 18 1 c regardless of variations of the influent cod and changes in hrt olr the effluent cod values were low with an average of 272 81 mg l based on anova results the effluent cods differences were statistically significant but the differences were small during operation at 18 1 c the effluent cod decreased with reducing the hrt while huang et al 17 observed an increase in the effluent cod with decreasing the hrt during similar temperature conditions the observed effluent cods were less than that of reported by maleki et al 21 at 23 1 c and comparable with values observed at 36 1 c 20 the effluent cod decreased as the process progressed this could be due to the long start up period and the prolonged srts that enhanced the hydrolysis as well as the decline in the influent cod over time as fig 3 shows the cod removal efficiency was steady and high during this study a remarkable difference between the supernatant cod and the effluent cod was observed which is similar to observations of chang et al 30 chu et al 5 ho and sung 31 huang et al 32 and smith et al 9 11 physical rejection of suspended organics physical adsorption of soluble cod on the membrane and biological degradation of cod by the microorganisms in the active biofilm developed on the surface of the membrane contribute to the difference between the supernatant and the effluent cods 6 9 11 31 32 smith et al 11 reported that developing a mature and active biofilm on the membrane surface helped with biological cod removal in this study the membrane worked for an extended period under low flux conditions sub critical conditions therefore a mature and active biofilm layer could have been developed on the membrane surface and membrane mediated cod removal took place during psychrophilic anmbr operations jeong et al 29 observed that the soluble cod in the reactor was four to twenty times higher than the effluent cod and stated that the cake layer acted as a dynamic membrane moreover in this study similar to ho and sung 6 study the membrane mediated soluble cod removal increased when the temperature was decreased from 21 1 c to 18 1 c as table 5 shows the sanmbr delivered high quality effluent with bod₅ less than 21 mg l irrespective of variations of the influent cod and changes in the hrt the effluent has high nutrients n p k content and can be used for either algae production 33 or agricultural irrigation the bod₅ removal efficiency in this study was around 99 statistical analysis of cod removal efficiencies did not show significant differences under various hrts at a confidence level of p 0 05 therefore it was concluded that hrt did not influence the cod removal efficiencies significantly the observed cod removal efficiencies were high which is due to complete rejection of solids and biomass by the membrane as well as additional removal of the cod by biofilm formed on the membrane surface the average cod removal efficiencies at 21 1 c and 18 1 c were 89 1 and 92 2 respectively the average cod removal was comparable with smith et al 9 gouveia et al 15 16 and chen et al 12 under low temperature conditions huang et al 17 reported removal efficiency of 91 4 1 4 for treating pharmaceutical wastewater cod 4746 539 mg l in psychrophilic conditions 10 0 22 5 c at olr of 2 37 0 28 kg cod m³ d hrt 48 1 1 0 h which was close to this study 3 1 2 sanmbr biogas yield and composition the biogas production yield and composition at stp are presented in fig 4 a and b respectively at 21 1 c as the hrt decreased from 3 2 days to 2 6 days the biogas yield decreased from 0 26 0 02 to 0 22 0 04 l at stp g codremoved at 18 1 c the biogas yield increased from 0 24 0 04 l at stp g codremoved to 0 28 0 04 l at stp g codremoved as the hrt decreased from 3 2 days to 1 5 days these results were in agreement with gao et al 10 that reported a rise in the biogas yield in response to the increase in olr based on the anova analysis at 18 1 c the biogas yield differences were statically significant but small the biogas yield in this study was high compared with our previous work at room temperature conditions 21 this might be because the proper sealing of the system by modifying the biogas collection tubing allowed collecting the whole biogas produced during this study also the bioreactor was less disturbed during this study compared with our room temperature study 21 moreover prolonged srts applied in this study along with minimum disturbance of the system provided sufficient residence time for both microorganisms adaption and organic matters digestion which contributed to high biogas production yield dong 34 dong et al 35 huang et al 32 and musa et al 36 studied the effect of srt and hrt on the performance of anmbrs they concluded that srt and hrt did not affect the cod and bod₅ removal but long srts led to minimal sludge production and improved biogas production yield this means that when the srt is long enough the major part of cod is consumed for biogas production instead of biomass reproduction similarly in this study extended srts enhanced biogas production yield however the biogas yield in this study was less than our mesophilic conditions study 20 this could be attributed to the higher solubility of co₂ and ch₄ at lower temperatures according to henry s law which led to biogas lost as at low temperatures a portion of biogas dissolves in the water and carried out with the effluent 4 9 12 19 the biogas lost in the effluent was not measured in this study another reason for the decreased biogas yield in this experiment compared with maleki et al 20 is probably the lower activity of methanogens at psychrophilic conditions as fig 4 b and table 4 show the methane ch₄ content varied between 77 33 1 27 and 80 95 1 14 composition of methane in this study was higher than our mesophilic study 20 this could be because the solubility of co₂ in water is considerably about 40 60 times according to hayes et al 37 greater than ch₄ also as stated in preceding paragraphs lower temperatures increase the solubility of ch₄ and co₂ in water thus at lower temperatures more co₂ is dissolved in the water compared with ch₄ the ch₄ content recorded in this study was close to those reported by gouveia et al 15 16 and hu et al 19 as well as the higher ends of the range stated by chen et al 13 as table 6 shows anmbrs that applied biogas sparging 15 38 16 had a higher ch₄ content compared with the anmbrs with no biogas sparging that is because biogas circulation reduces mass transfer limitations and prevents methane super saturation which minimizes the amount of dissolved methane in the effluent 38 in this study biogas was circulated in the bioreactor via the spargers thus the higher composition of methane in this study compared with smith et al 9 chen et al 12 13 and huang et al 17 could be due to the biogas sparging which contributed to desorption of the dissolved methane the n₂ content in this study was less than that of reported by giménez et al 38 and yoo et al 18 and comparable with gouveia et al 15 16 see table 6 the higher n₂ content is attributed to the release of dissolved nitrogen in the influent to the gas phase in the bioreactor 18 the percentage of co₂ in the biogas was low compared with chen et al 12 13 3 2 membrane performance 3 2 1 membrane flux and tmp development the performance of the membrane was assessed daily by recording its tmp and flux fig 5 a and b illustrate the performance of the membrane when the membrane flux increased from 2 4 0 6 lmh l m² h in the start up to 4 0 0 1 lmh in period 2 the tmp changed from 4 5 1 0 kpa to 7 0 3 8 kpa the membrane sustained a stable flux during periods 1 and 2 and no significant fouling was observed by transition from 21 c to 18 c the tmp increased to around 20 kpa and then on night 242 the sparger pump b broke which led to a further increase in the tmp 24 4 kpa however after replacing the sparger pump the tmp dropped to 13 5 1 7 kpa and the membrane sustained the desired flux during period 3 in period 4 as the flux increased to 4 2 0 3 lmh the tmp jumped to 23 6 2 5 kpa at 0 34 kpa d to and the membrane could not maintain the flux hence the operation was stopped and a new membrane was installed in the bioreactor and its flux was set to 7 0 0 2 lmh for the next phase of the study period 5 during phase 5 the tmp increased rapidly from 4 1 kpa to 9 3 6 0 kpa at 0 33 kpa d because the membrane flux was high compared to the previous periods the steady rise of tmp while the flux was declining confirms the rapid growth of the cake layer fouling on days 352 and 367 new batches of malting wastewater samples with low bod₅ compared with the previous batches were fed to the anmbr also on night 369 biogas sparging interrupted due to a technical problem pumps were off until the next day interruption of biogas sparging led to cake layer formation on the membrane surface and the tmp jumped to 44 kpa on day 370 monitoring the tmp and flux showed that at shorter hrts higher permeate flux the tmp increased faster this is in agreement with huang et al 32 yue et al 39 and chen et al 40 observations the higher membrane flux at shorter hrts forces the bioreactor contents including smp soluble microbial products and eps extracellular polymeric substances to move faster towards the membrane surface and develop cake layer microorganisms produce more smp and eps at higher olrs watanabe et al 14 stated that smp and eps contribute to pore blocking and irreversible membrane fouling as fig 5 b shows the membrane permeability was stable during periods 1 and 2 and it decreased during periods 3 and 4 as fouling developed permeability of the new membrane installed on day 326 is higher compared to periods 1 4 which is due to higher membrane flux during this period 3 2 2 membrane fouling analysis membrane fouling was indicated when the tmp was high and it was difficult to sustain the targeted flux for the study the membrane permeability was restored up to 56 9 80 0 and 89 8 of the virgin membrane permeability after the physical naclo solution and citric acid solution cleanings respectively the permeability tests results showed that the cake layer formation was the dominant fraction of the total fouling compared with organic and inorganic fouling chen et al 12 and watanabe et al 14 reported similar results for the fouling mechanism membrane fouling was further examined by studying morphology sem images and elemental composition edx spectra of the used membrane samples after cleaning fig 6 a shows the foulants on the surface of the membrane after cleaning which proves that the cleaning procedure did not completely remove the foulants and confirms the results of the permeability tests spectrum 1 fig 6 b contains fe and n peaks that indicate inorganic and organic fouling in the spectrum of the virgin membrane image not presented only peaks of c f and o were observed which are the main constituents of the membrane distribution and size of particles in the bioreactor also affect the membrane fouling and smaller size particles have a higher propensity for cake layer formation 25 41 the particle size distribution of the mixed liquor and the supernatant data not shown showed particles between 0 1 10 μm and 100 1000 μm that could have contributed to the membrane fouling 3 3 microbial community analysis the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction dgge pcr technique was used to assess the microbial community changes in the sanmbr the dgge image was analyzed by bionumerics 7 6 26 software and the generated cluster analysis dendrogram is presented in fig 7 the dendrogram shows the similarity of the microbial population each band of the dgge image represents a distinct group of microorganisms the microbial community changed when the operating temperature was decreased from mesophilic conditions in the start up period to psychrophilic temperatures as shown by arrows on the dgge image in fig 7 two bands were present in almost all conditions microbial species of samples taken at 21 1 c and 18 1 c were put in different groups with a similarity of only 40 samples taken at the same temperature conditions but different hrts were put in groups with high similarity indexes which suggests the microbial community did not change that much at 18 1 c in periods 3 and 4 the microbial community did not change remarkably in response to the changes in hrt this could be due to low microbial growth under psychrophilic conditions as well as high biomass retention 11 however the microbial community of period 5 was placed in a separate group from periods 3 4 and new bands appeared during phase 5 the difference in species diversity between period 5 and periods 3 4 might have been caused by the variations of the hrt introducing a new batch of influent to the sanmbr and the sanmbr disturbance because the bioreactor was opened on day 326 to replace the fouled membrane and the system was purged with n₂ also the bod₅ of the new batch of influent fed on day 352 to the bioreactor was less than the previous ones 3 4 cost analysis maleki et al 20 estimated the capital cost and operating cost of an anmbr plant with the flow rate of 2 000 m³ d treating malting wastewater at mesophilic conditions as 3 6 million and 420 209 year respectively table 7 compares the biogas and energy production of the anmbr at psychrophilic and mesophilic conditions based on the cod removal efficiency of 91 an influent flow rate of 2 000 m³ d and biogas yield of 0 26 l at stp g codremoved the biogas production rate at psychrophilic conditions is 2 366 m³ d hence considering the methane content of 75 the methane production rate would be 1 775 m³ at stp per day burning the produced biogas during psychrophilic process in a 90 efficient condensing furnace can produce around 63 383 mj energy per day the produced energy could contribute to the energy required by the anmbr plant selling the produced biogas at 0 5 per m³ of methane 42 creates an income of 323 846 per year which is comparable with the revenue calculated in mesophilic conditions and could offset a significant part of operating costs 4 conclusions in this study malting wastewater was treated successfully in a psychrophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor and its energy content was recovered in the form of biogas the operation of the psychrophilic anmbr was stable with a high biogas yield and methane content during operation at 18 1 c the sanmbr delivered a high quality effluent with low cod 272 81 mg l and high nutrients n p k content the results showed that applying extended srts favored more biogas production the membrane permeability recovery tests implied that physical and chemical cleanings were effective in removing fouling to a large extent based on the microbial community analysis some species disappeared and new species emerged in response to the changes in operating parameters temperature and hrt and the progress of the process treating malting wastewater with anmbr technology at psychrophilic conditions in regions with a low temperature could create remarkable savings for malting plants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14107,this study investigated long term operation 370 days of a psychrophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor for malting wastewater treatment and biogas production at 18 1 c despite changing the hydraulic retention time hrt and fluctuations of the influent cod steady operation with an average cod removal efficiency of 92 2 was achieved the biogas yield was 0 26 0 04 l at stp g codremoved with an average methane content of 79 43 2 69 the cod of supernatant and effluent decreased as the experiment proceeded the membrane performance sustained the targeted flux for each period until day 325 of the operation the results of membrane permeability recovery tests showed that cake layer formation was the predominant fouling mechanism the microbial community study showed that the microbial community changed in response to variations of hrt and temperature keywords psychrophilic anaerobic treatment submerged anmbr malting wastewater microbial community biogas production 1 introduction malting wastewater has a high soluble chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients content and thereby it is suitable for energy recovery via anaerobic process treating this waste stream in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr could deliver a high quality effluent while producing biogas with a smaller footprint compared with the conventional systems anmbrs can be operated at optimal thermophilic 55 60 c mesophilic 27 37 c and psychrophilic 7 25 c temperature ranges 1 operating anmbrs under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions when the temperature of the waste stream is in the psychrophilic range increases the operating costs and prevents the industrial application of anmbr technology operating anaerobic processes at low temperatures slows down the biomass growth rate and hinders the hydrolysis reactions 2 3 anmbrs provide a solution for the problems mentioned above by allowing long solids retention times srts while operating at shorter hrts long srts offer adequate time for the growth of microorganisms and hydrolysis of particulate colloidal organics during operation at low temperatures however the operation of anmbrs at psychrophilic temperature conditions is still challenging in a critical review published by smith et al 4 only a few researchers 5 7 operated their anmbrs under psychrophilic conditions of 20 c 11 c and 15 c dvořák et al 8 in a recent review paper have listed lab scale pilot scale and full scale anmbrs treating real wastewaters from the slaughterhouse dairy manure molasses food and bamboo industries most real wastewater treatment studies cited by dvořák et al 8 were operated at 26 38 c and only martinez sosa et al 3 operated their anmbr at 20 c for 21 days table 1 shows recent studies 2013 2018 on anmbrs operated at a psychrophilic range of 25 c and below most studies cited in table 1 have treated synthetic municipal wastewater 9 14 among these studies smith et al 9 gouveia et al 15 16 and huang et al 17 evaluated the treatment of real municipal wastewater using anmbrs under psychrophilic temperature conditions of below 20 c besides only huang et al 17 treated real industrial wastewater pharmaceutical industry in psychrophilic range of 10 22 5 c as explained in the preceding paragraphs limited studies reported the application of anmbrs for treating real industrial wastewaters at the psychrophilic temperature range of 20 c and below moreover based on our literature review application of anmbr technology for malting wastewater treatment at psychrophilic conditions has not been reported malting wastewater has medium to high cod concentration 82 87 soluble cod and high nutrient n and p content and it doesn t need nutrients addition for anaerobic treatment therefore malting wastewater is more promising for biogas production via anaerobic process under psychrophilic temperature conditions compared with municipal wastewater hence the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of long term operation of a submerged anmbr sanmbr for treating malting wastewater and energy recovery under psychrophilic temperature conditions we studied the anmbr operation at psychrophilic conditions because the annual mean temperature of malting wastewater in canada varies between 14 18 c based on a local malting plant data shorter hrts increase the possibility of implementing the anmbrs in full scale plants 18 therefore the hrt was decreased during various periods of the study and the impact of changing the hrt on the anmbr performance was evaluated also the performance of the membrane was investigated by measuring its flux and transmembrane pressure tmp besides the permeability recovery tests the scanning electron microscope sem images and the energy dispersive x ray edx spectra were used to characterize membrane fouling furthermore the response of the microbial community to the temperature and hrt changes as well as the progress of the process was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 the bioreactor configuration inoculation operational parameters and influent characteristics a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr coupled with a submerged flat sheet ultrafiltration membrane unit material pvdf pore size 0 1 μm area 0 030 m² was used for the psychrophilic treatment of malting wastewater fig 1 shows the sanmbr setup the water bath in our previous studies 20 21 was replaced by a chiller in the current set up the detailed operation of the sanmbr setup has been explained elsewhere 20 the seed sludge was obtained from an anaerobic brewery wastewater treatment plant guelph canada during the start up period the bioreactor was operated at 35 c for 32 days then the sanmbr temperature was gradually reduced by varying the chiller s temperature the sanmbr temperature was 21 1 c during periods 1 and 2 then it was decreased to 18 1 c for periods 3 4 and 5 the bioreactor was operated continuously for 370 days to assess the long term treatment efficiency of the sanmbr at psychrophilic temperature biogas sparging 4 0 l min and intermittent 3 min work 2 min rest for permeate pump were applied to control the membrane fouling table 2 describes the operational conditions of the bioreactor under psychrophilic temperature conditions the optimal ph for anaerobic digestion is between 6 8 and 7 5 1 sodium hydroxide was added to the influent tank to keep the ph of the bioreactor at 7 4 0 1 during the experiment the hrt of each period was controlled by adjusting the membrane permeate flux the flow rate of influent was equal to the flow rate of effluent because the reactor effective volume was kept constant the wastewater samples used in this study were taken from the steeping step of a local malting plant table 3 presents the characteristics of malting wastewater samples measured during this study malting wastewater consisted of 87 soluble cod and contained essential nutrients for anaerobic treatment 2 2 sampling and analysis the influent mixed liquor effluent and biogas samples were collected and analyzed periodically all sample analyses including cod bod₅ biological oxygen demand mlss mixed liquor suspended solids psd particle size distribution nutrients n and p and metal ions concentrations were conducted following maleki et al 20 sludge was not wasted except for sampling which resulted in long srts of 720 727 846 862 and 546 days for periods 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively also the average mlss concentration during periods 1 2 3 4 and 5 was 21 1 g l 19 4 g l 18 1 g l 17 9 g l and 17 5 g l respectively the biogas yield and production rate were adapted to the standard temperature and pressure stp of 0 c and 1 atm at the end of period 4 the membrane could not sustain the targeted flux hence on day 326 the bioreactor was opened and the fouled membrane was taken out then a new membrane was placed in the bioreactor and the system was purged with n₂ and the anmbr operation was resumed the fouled membrane was sent for physical chemical cleanings and permeability recovery tests the cleaning procedure was performed following maleki et al 20 physical cleaning with a wet sponge followed by rinsing with tap water was applied to remove the cake layer of the fouled membrane next the membrane was submerged in 200 ppm naclo solution for 2 h followed by rinsing with tap water to remove organic fouling then the membrane was immersed in 2000 ppm citric acid solution for 2 h and rinsined with tap water to remove inorganic fouling the membrane permeability recovery tests were performed after each cleaning step by measuring the tmp of membrane for a range of clean water fluxes following maleki et al 20 afterward the membrane samples were prepared for the morphology and elemental composition analysis based on maleki et al 20 an energy dispersive spectrometer with a scanning electron microscope sem edx hitachi su 70 was used to study the morphological and elemental composition of the membrane samples 2 3 microbial community analysis in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge first dnas are extracted from samples then the extracted dnas are amplified using the polymerase chain reaction pcr afterward the pcr products amplified dnas are run along a gradient gel the gel contains a gradient of a dna denaturant chemical mixture such as urea and formamide electrophoresis of denaturing gradient gel separates dna fragments due to their different melting denaturing properties 22 each band in dgge image corresponds to a phylotype 23 or an operational taxonomic unit out and the fingerprints formed reflects the community diversity 24 the mixed liquor samples for dna extraction were prepared according to maleki et al 21 the dnas of the samples were extracted using the quick dna fecal soil microbe miniprep kit zymo research catalog d6010 following the instructions provided by the manufacturer the primer set was 341 f gc 5 gc clamp cctagggaggcagcag 3 and 534 r 5 attaccgcggctgctgg 3 eurofins genomics the pcr amplification was done according to maleki et al 21 gradient former bio rad model 475 was used to prepare 16 cm 16 cm 1 mm polyacrylamide gels the 25 and 65 denaturant gradient gels were made according to lin et al 25 the amplified dna samples pcr products were loaded in the wells of one gel and the analysis was duplicated electrophoresis gel staining and image acquiring were done following maleki et al 21 bionumerics 7 6 26 was employed for the cluster analysis of the dgge images as stated by maleki et al 21 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical significance of the experimental data was evaluated by the one way analysis of variance anova with significance of 95 p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance of the sanmbr 3 1 1 organic removals in sanmbr fig 2 represents hrt olr organic loading rate and biogas production rate during this study the hrt was decreased from 4 6 1 1 days in the start up period to 1 5 0 1 days in period 5 by adjusting the permeate flux as a result the olr varied between 1 0 0 2 kg cod m³ d start up period and 2 1 0 2 kg cod m³ d period 5 see table 2 as fig 2 shows decreasing the hrt did not change the olr significantly because the influent cod was not constant and it fluctuated during the experiment the influent used in this study was real malting wastewater which its cod varied for different batches the cod of malting wastewater is affected by various factors such as the variety and growth conditions of barley 27 as well as the batch wise nature of the steeping process in this study the olr varied between 1 4 0 1 kg cod m³ d in period 1 and 2 1 0 2 kg cod m³ d in period 5 which is less than olr of 3 6 kg cod m³ d reported by borzacconi et al 28 in a full scale uasb reactor treating malting wastewater at 17 25 c this is because olr in anmbrs is limited by the size of the anmbr and the membrane critical flux higher olrs could be achieved by optimizing the configuration and operating conditions of the anmbr 20 for example the integration of an uasb with an anaerobic membrane filtration tank could create an uasb anmbr system that combines the advantages of uasb high rate and membrane filtration high quality effluent and prevention of sludge washout for wastewater treatment at 21 1 c shortening the hrt did not impact the biogas production rate much because the olr did not change significantly due to a lower influent cod concentration see table 2 however at 18 1 c the biogas production rate increased from 1 12 0 20 l d in period 3 to 2 89 0 40 l d in period 5 as the hrt decreased from 3 2 days to 1 5 days this is because by reducing the hrt the olr increased from 1 2 kg cod m³ d in period 3 to 2 1 kg cod m³ d in period 5 the influent supernatant and effluent cods and the sanmbr s removal efficiencies are depicted in fig 3 the influent cod varied significantly during this study because as stated earlier the influent was real malting wastewater and its cod was not steady as the experiment proceeded and the hrt decreased the supernatant cod gradually decreased from 2258 416 mg l in period 1 to 1454 276 mg l in period 5 see table 4 conversely jeong et al 29 observed an increase in the cod concentrations in the bioreactor with decreasing hrt the decreasing pattern of supernatant cod in this study is in agreement with our observation during room temperature study 21 but different from the mesophilic treatment study 20 the decrease of the supernatant cod as the process progressed might be due to the decline of the influent cod from 4332 179 mg l in period 1 to 3238 384 mg l in period 5 also it might be because operating at prolonged srts provided enough time for the adjustment of the biomass to temperature 11 which as a result enhanced the hydrolysis of particulates and colloids another possible reason could be decline of biomass decay at shorter hrts because at short hrts starvation decreases and as a result microorganisms generate less smp this may occur when the wastewater is highly biodegradable the effluent cod values in periods 1 and 2 21 1 c were higher than that of periods 3 4 and 5 18 1 c see table 4 at temperature 18 1 c regardless of variations of the influent cod and changes in hrt olr the effluent cod values were low with an average of 272 81 mg l based on anova results the effluent cods differences were statistically significant but the differences were small during operation at 18 1 c the effluent cod decreased with reducing the hrt while huang et al 17 observed an increase in the effluent cod with decreasing the hrt during similar temperature conditions the observed effluent cods were less than that of reported by maleki et al 21 at 23 1 c and comparable with values observed at 36 1 c 20 the effluent cod decreased as the process progressed this could be due to the long start up period and the prolonged srts that enhanced the hydrolysis as well as the decline in the influent cod over time as fig 3 shows the cod removal efficiency was steady and high during this study a remarkable difference between the supernatant cod and the effluent cod was observed which is similar to observations of chang et al 30 chu et al 5 ho and sung 31 huang et al 32 and smith et al 9 11 physical rejection of suspended organics physical adsorption of soluble cod on the membrane and biological degradation of cod by the microorganisms in the active biofilm developed on the surface of the membrane contribute to the difference between the supernatant and the effluent cods 6 9 11 31 32 smith et al 11 reported that developing a mature and active biofilm on the membrane surface helped with biological cod removal in this study the membrane worked for an extended period under low flux conditions sub critical conditions therefore a mature and active biofilm layer could have been developed on the membrane surface and membrane mediated cod removal took place during psychrophilic anmbr operations jeong et al 29 observed that the soluble cod in the reactor was four to twenty times higher than the effluent cod and stated that the cake layer acted as a dynamic membrane moreover in this study similar to ho and sung 6 study the membrane mediated soluble cod removal increased when the temperature was decreased from 21 1 c to 18 1 c as table 5 shows the sanmbr delivered high quality effluent with bod₅ less than 21 mg l irrespective of variations of the influent cod and changes in the hrt the effluent has high nutrients n p k content and can be used for either algae production 33 or agricultural irrigation the bod₅ removal efficiency in this study was around 99 statistical analysis of cod removal efficiencies did not show significant differences under various hrts at a confidence level of p 0 05 therefore it was concluded that hrt did not influence the cod removal efficiencies significantly the observed cod removal efficiencies were high which is due to complete rejection of solids and biomass by the membrane as well as additional removal of the cod by biofilm formed on the membrane surface the average cod removal efficiencies at 21 1 c and 18 1 c were 89 1 and 92 2 respectively the average cod removal was comparable with smith et al 9 gouveia et al 15 16 and chen et al 12 under low temperature conditions huang et al 17 reported removal efficiency of 91 4 1 4 for treating pharmaceutical wastewater cod 4746 539 mg l in psychrophilic conditions 10 0 22 5 c at olr of 2 37 0 28 kg cod m³ d hrt 48 1 1 0 h which was close to this study 3 1 2 sanmbr biogas yield and composition the biogas production yield and composition at stp are presented in fig 4 a and b respectively at 21 1 c as the hrt decreased from 3 2 days to 2 6 days the biogas yield decreased from 0 26 0 02 to 0 22 0 04 l at stp g codremoved at 18 1 c the biogas yield increased from 0 24 0 04 l at stp g codremoved to 0 28 0 04 l at stp g codremoved as the hrt decreased from 3 2 days to 1 5 days these results were in agreement with gao et al 10 that reported a rise in the biogas yield in response to the increase in olr based on the anova analysis at 18 1 c the biogas yield differences were statically significant but small the biogas yield in this study was high compared with our previous work at room temperature conditions 21 this might be because the proper sealing of the system by modifying the biogas collection tubing allowed collecting the whole biogas produced during this study also the bioreactor was less disturbed during this study compared with our room temperature study 21 moreover prolonged srts applied in this study along with minimum disturbance of the system provided sufficient residence time for both microorganisms adaption and organic matters digestion which contributed to high biogas production yield dong 34 dong et al 35 huang et al 32 and musa et al 36 studied the effect of srt and hrt on the performance of anmbrs they concluded that srt and hrt did not affect the cod and bod₅ removal but long srts led to minimal sludge production and improved biogas production yield this means that when the srt is long enough the major part of cod is consumed for biogas production instead of biomass reproduction similarly in this study extended srts enhanced biogas production yield however the biogas yield in this study was less than our mesophilic conditions study 20 this could be attributed to the higher solubility of co₂ and ch₄ at lower temperatures according to henry s law which led to biogas lost as at low temperatures a portion of biogas dissolves in the water and carried out with the effluent 4 9 12 19 the biogas lost in the effluent was not measured in this study another reason for the decreased biogas yield in this experiment compared with maleki et al 20 is probably the lower activity of methanogens at psychrophilic conditions as fig 4 b and table 4 show the methane ch₄ content varied between 77 33 1 27 and 80 95 1 14 composition of methane in this study was higher than our mesophilic study 20 this could be because the solubility of co₂ in water is considerably about 40 60 times according to hayes et al 37 greater than ch₄ also as stated in preceding paragraphs lower temperatures increase the solubility of ch₄ and co₂ in water thus at lower temperatures more co₂ is dissolved in the water compared with ch₄ the ch₄ content recorded in this study was close to those reported by gouveia et al 15 16 and hu et al 19 as well as the higher ends of the range stated by chen et al 13 as table 6 shows anmbrs that applied biogas sparging 15 38 16 had a higher ch₄ content compared with the anmbrs with no biogas sparging that is because biogas circulation reduces mass transfer limitations and prevents methane super saturation which minimizes the amount of dissolved methane in the effluent 38 in this study biogas was circulated in the bioreactor via the spargers thus the higher composition of methane in this study compared with smith et al 9 chen et al 12 13 and huang et al 17 could be due to the biogas sparging which contributed to desorption of the dissolved methane the n₂ content in this study was less than that of reported by giménez et al 38 and yoo et al 18 and comparable with gouveia et al 15 16 see table 6 the higher n₂ content is attributed to the release of dissolved nitrogen in the influent to the gas phase in the bioreactor 18 the percentage of co₂ in the biogas was low compared with chen et al 12 13 3 2 membrane performance 3 2 1 membrane flux and tmp development the performance of the membrane was assessed daily by recording its tmp and flux fig 5 a and b illustrate the performance of the membrane when the membrane flux increased from 2 4 0 6 lmh l m² h in the start up to 4 0 0 1 lmh in period 2 the tmp changed from 4 5 1 0 kpa to 7 0 3 8 kpa the membrane sustained a stable flux during periods 1 and 2 and no significant fouling was observed by transition from 21 c to 18 c the tmp increased to around 20 kpa and then on night 242 the sparger pump b broke which led to a further increase in the tmp 24 4 kpa however after replacing the sparger pump the tmp dropped to 13 5 1 7 kpa and the membrane sustained the desired flux during period 3 in period 4 as the flux increased to 4 2 0 3 lmh the tmp jumped to 23 6 2 5 kpa at 0 34 kpa d to and the membrane could not maintain the flux hence the operation was stopped and a new membrane was installed in the bioreactor and its flux was set to 7 0 0 2 lmh for the next phase of the study period 5 during phase 5 the tmp increased rapidly from 4 1 kpa to 9 3 6 0 kpa at 0 33 kpa d because the membrane flux was high compared to the previous periods the steady rise of tmp while the flux was declining confirms the rapid growth of the cake layer fouling on days 352 and 367 new batches of malting wastewater samples with low bod₅ compared with the previous batches were fed to the anmbr also on night 369 biogas sparging interrupted due to a technical problem pumps were off until the next day interruption of biogas sparging led to cake layer formation on the membrane surface and the tmp jumped to 44 kpa on day 370 monitoring the tmp and flux showed that at shorter hrts higher permeate flux the tmp increased faster this is in agreement with huang et al 32 yue et al 39 and chen et al 40 observations the higher membrane flux at shorter hrts forces the bioreactor contents including smp soluble microbial products and eps extracellular polymeric substances to move faster towards the membrane surface and develop cake layer microorganisms produce more smp and eps at higher olrs watanabe et al 14 stated that smp and eps contribute to pore blocking and irreversible membrane fouling as fig 5 b shows the membrane permeability was stable during periods 1 and 2 and it decreased during periods 3 and 4 as fouling developed permeability of the new membrane installed on day 326 is higher compared to periods 1 4 which is due to higher membrane flux during this period 3 2 2 membrane fouling analysis membrane fouling was indicated when the tmp was high and it was difficult to sustain the targeted flux for the study the membrane permeability was restored up to 56 9 80 0 and 89 8 of the virgin membrane permeability after the physical naclo solution and citric acid solution cleanings respectively the permeability tests results showed that the cake layer formation was the dominant fraction of the total fouling compared with organic and inorganic fouling chen et al 12 and watanabe et al 14 reported similar results for the fouling mechanism membrane fouling was further examined by studying morphology sem images and elemental composition edx spectra of the used membrane samples after cleaning fig 6 a shows the foulants on the surface of the membrane after cleaning which proves that the cleaning procedure did not completely remove the foulants and confirms the results of the permeability tests spectrum 1 fig 6 b contains fe and n peaks that indicate inorganic and organic fouling in the spectrum of the virgin membrane image not presented only peaks of c f and o were observed which are the main constituents of the membrane distribution and size of particles in the bioreactor also affect the membrane fouling and smaller size particles have a higher propensity for cake layer formation 25 41 the particle size distribution of the mixed liquor and the supernatant data not shown showed particles between 0 1 10 μm and 100 1000 μm that could have contributed to the membrane fouling 3 3 microbial community analysis the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction dgge pcr technique was used to assess the microbial community changes in the sanmbr the dgge image was analyzed by bionumerics 7 6 26 software and the generated cluster analysis dendrogram is presented in fig 7 the dendrogram shows the similarity of the microbial population each band of the dgge image represents a distinct group of microorganisms the microbial community changed when the operating temperature was decreased from mesophilic conditions in the start up period to psychrophilic temperatures as shown by arrows on the dgge image in fig 7 two bands were present in almost all conditions microbial species of samples taken at 21 1 c and 18 1 c were put in different groups with a similarity of only 40 samples taken at the same temperature conditions but different hrts were put in groups with high similarity indexes which suggests the microbial community did not change that much at 18 1 c in periods 3 and 4 the microbial community did not change remarkably in response to the changes in hrt this could be due to low microbial growth under psychrophilic conditions as well as high biomass retention 11 however the microbial community of period 5 was placed in a separate group from periods 3 4 and new bands appeared during phase 5 the difference in species diversity between period 5 and periods 3 4 might have been caused by the variations of the hrt introducing a new batch of influent to the sanmbr and the sanmbr disturbance because the bioreactor was opened on day 326 to replace the fouled membrane and the system was purged with n₂ also the bod₅ of the new batch of influent fed on day 352 to the bioreactor was less than the previous ones 3 4 cost analysis maleki et al 20 estimated the capital cost and operating cost of an anmbr plant with the flow rate of 2 000 m³ d treating malting wastewater at mesophilic conditions as 3 6 million and 420 209 year respectively table 7 compares the biogas and energy production of the anmbr at psychrophilic and mesophilic conditions based on the cod removal efficiency of 91 an influent flow rate of 2 000 m³ d and biogas yield of 0 26 l at stp g codremoved the biogas production rate at psychrophilic conditions is 2 366 m³ d hence considering the methane content of 75 the methane production rate would be 1 775 m³ at stp per day burning the produced biogas during psychrophilic process in a 90 efficient condensing furnace can produce around 63 383 mj energy per day the produced energy could contribute to the energy required by the anmbr plant selling the produced biogas at 0 5 per m³ of methane 42 creates an income of 323 846 per year which is comparable with the revenue calculated in mesophilic conditions and could offset a significant part of operating costs 4 conclusions in this study malting wastewater was treated successfully in a psychrophilic anaerobic membrane bioreactor and its energy content was recovered in the form of biogas the operation of the psychrophilic anmbr was stable with a high biogas yield and methane content during operation at 18 1 c the sanmbr delivered a high quality effluent with low cod 272 81 mg l and high nutrients n p k content the results showed that applying extended srts favored more biogas production the membrane permeability recovery tests implied that physical and chemical cleanings were effective in removing fouling to a large extent based on the microbial community analysis some species disappeared and new species emerged in response to the changes in operating parameters temperature and hrt and the progress of the process treating malting wastewater with anmbr technology at psychrophilic conditions in regions with a low temperature could create remarkable savings for malting plants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

14108,polyetherimide nanofiltration membranes were fabricated by the double blade casting technique throughout this technique the application of different compositions for the top layer and sub layer polymeric solution becomes possible and therefore it could be used as an effective tool for controlling the morphology of the membranes the preliminary experiments showed that the highest polymer concentration for the sub layer for obtaining a suitable morphology and low hydraulic resistance and a defect free selective top layer is 16 and 19 wt respectively the effect of membrane fabrication parameters i e solvent co solvent weight ratio in the top layer ψ top layer casting thickness δ and evaporation time θ on the performance of the membranes was evaluated and optimized using the rsm method twenty experiments were proposed by the rsm design of experiments method the experiments were done and 20 membranes were fabricated at the proposed conditions the membranes were evaluated for pure water flux nacl and mgso4 rejection and flux and porosity the analysis of variance anova indicated that evaporation time had the most significant impact on the flux and rejection whilst porosity was most affected by top layer thickness finally two options for the optimization of the fabrication condition were considered in case 1 membrane fabrication parameters were optimized for attaining maximum nacl rejection and in case 2 both flux and nacl rejection were considered as the targets for optimization for case 1 the best salt rejection was obtained as 25 7 at a permeate flux of 0 38 l m2h bar and in case 2 the optimum values for salt rejection and flux were obtained at 13 6 and 1 47 l m2h bar respectively reasonable agreements were observed between the predicted and actual

solvent weight ratio in the top layer 1 introduction in the past few decades membrane technologies have been recognized as one of the most reliable and effective processes in water and wastewater treatment based on the pore size of the membranes and their operational conditions these processes are categorized into different categories including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro etc nanofiltration membranes with a pore size ranging from 0 5 to 2 nm are considered as an intermediate level between uf and ro while these membranes benefit from higher fluxes than ro membranes they show higher rejection than uf membranes 1 these characteristics have made nanofiltration a suitable and economically efficient separation process with relatively high flux 2 the separation mechanism in the commercial tfc nanofiltration membranes is based on both size and donnan exclusions while the integrated skin membranes are only based on the size exclusion mechanism 3 polyetherimide pei is a suitable material for the fabrication of both porous and non porous membranes from microfiltration to gas separation because of its unique chemical structure high mechanical strength and thermal and chemical stability 4 15 the non solvent induced phase separation nips technique is the most commonly used method for the fabrication of integrated skin asymmetric porous nanofiltration membranes 16 17 in this method the polymeric solution is cast on a support or a glass plate and then immersed in a non solvent coagulation bath to form an asymmetric porous membrane with or without a selective top layer depending on the fabrication condition 18 19 this method is ideal for fabrication of microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes but for fabrication of nanofiltration membranes due to needing to high concentrations of the polymer solution it has some drawbacks such as low porosity high hydraulic resistance against permeation and highly difficult the control of both the pore size and the top layer skin thickness 20 for fabrication of integrated skin nf membranes it is necessary to keep the concentration of polymeric solution high enough through which small pores in the range of 0 5 2 nm are formed at this condition a very thick support layer with low porosity small pores and high hydraulic resistance are formed if the concentration of the polymeric solution is low the pore size of the top layer would be larger than the desired range for nf membranes therefore dual layer casting is proposed in which two different polymeric solutions are cast simultaneously by a double blade film casting device to form a dual layer film e g sub layer and top layer this is unlike the conventional film casting method in which a single layer film is cast and immersed in the phase inversion condition to form symmetric or asymmetric porous membrane or the sub layer is fabricated and then a selective layer is cast onto the sub layer to form a composite membrane 21 since the polymeric solutions have their own properties and specifications such as the miscibility of the solvent and non solvent polymer concentration and possible presence of additives each layer shows its own behavior in the phase separation stage consequently this technique makes better control over the morphological structure of different layers possible while there is good adhesion between them furthermore in this manner it becomes possible to use a polymeric solution having a higher concentration for the selective top layer and a solution with lower concentration for the support layer to produce a selective top layer and porous support with lower hydraulic resistance 22 23 due to some restrictions of this method few studies have been performed for only limited applications delamination of the layers is a serious defect in the membranes fabricated by this method pereira et al 22 fabricated two layer porous membranes for the first time by a double blade casting knife followed by nips in the water bath they used polyetherimide pei and polyethersulfone pes as the polymers and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp and tetrahydrofuran thf as the solvents they found that when the two polymeric solution compositions are far from their binodal curves there is not enough time for inter diffusion of the solutions and therefore delamination occurs li et al 24 fabricated dual layer pei psf porous membranes by co casting of pei and psf dissolved in nmp as the top layer and sub layer respectively and indicated the source of adhesion and delamination in the two layer membranes and indicated that the difference between the shrinkage values of the layers is the most influential factor in delamination of the layers hashemifard et al 25 decreased the delamination of the layers by addition of pei in the sub layer of pei pei pes integrated skin dual layer flat sheet membranes fabricated by the double blade casting technique they used nmp as the common solvent and studied the effects of pei concentration in the top layer the viscosity and pei pes ratio in the sub layer as the most crucial parameters in the final membrane performance they concluded that the application of incompatible polymers for the support layer would result in macro void formation which increases gas permeability liu and ng 23 fabricated psf single and dual layer membranes by the co casting of psf in dmf solutions with different concentrations and showed that when the same polymer and solvent is used in both layers delamination would not occur they obtained higher water fluxes from the dual layer membranes in comparison to the single layer membranes with the same polymer concentration the double blade casting technique has also reported being used for the fabrication of super hydrophobic pvdf membrane via vips technique for application in the vacuum membrane distillation process 26 through this method the fabrication of a micro porous thin layer with a narrow pore size supported by a highly porous sub layer becomes possible xia et al 27 have reported the fabrication of a delamination free dual layer psf pes pi and pei membranes using nmp dmf and dmac solvents by the co casting technique they showed that the origin of the delamination is the difference in hydrophobicity of the layers and delamination could be prevented by control of the hydrophobicity by adjusting the thickness and solvent content of each layer altun et al 28 investigated the effect evaporation time and also the influence of adding co solvent to the polymeric solution on membrane morphology of polysulfone based membranes they showed that by increasing the evaporation time before entering the cast polymeric film into the coagulation bath the permeability would decrease but better rejection characteristics could be obtained the rejection of rose bengal solution in isopropanol increased from around 60 90 when the evaporation time was increased from 0 to 100 s in presence of 1 4 dioxane dx or thf as a co solvent they also observed the same behavior when they increased the co solvent solvent ratio from 0 100 to 100 0 wu et al 29 fabricated pvc pvc g pegma blend membranes and observed that by the addition of thf as the co solvent the rejection was increased but the permeability decreased considerably from the above mentioned studies it could be concluded that delamination could be prevented by using the same polymer and solvent in the two layers moreover evaporation time and co solvent concentration are useful parameters for controlling the permeability and rejection of dual layer membranes fabricated by co casting technique therefore in this paper the co casting technique was used for the fabrication of integrated skin asymmetric pei nanofiltration membranes as a facile single step method where the selective top layer and porous sub layer are going to have different compositions and or characteristics this is a unique technique that enabled us to fabricate membranes with the desired morphological structures as compared to the conventional composite membranes where a support layer is fabricated at first and then the selective layer is cast or coated on it this method is much simpler and faster moreover this method does not cause pore blocking of the sub layer which is very common through the intrusion of coating solution on the porous substrates during the fabrication of the composite membranes additionally in all the previous studies performed on the co casting fabrication of membranes the highly concentrated polymeric solution higher viscosity has always been cast as the bottom and the lower polymer content solution lower viscosity cast as the top layer in the current research it is for the first time that the lower concentration polymeric solution is used as the sub layer and the higher concentration polymeric solution is applied as the top layer in addition the introduction of two more parameters i e top layer casting thickness and top layer solution concentration make the fabrication of tailor made membranes for different applications possible maximizing salt rejection or optimizing permeability or both in this regard the effect of polymeric concentration in each layer solvent co solvent ratio evaporation time and the top layer thickness on the membrane characteristics and performance were studied and optimized using response surface methodology rsm design of experiments method 2 materials and method 2 1 materials ultem 1000 polyetherimide pei mw 50 921 g mol 25 was supplied from general electric company usa n n dimethyl formamide dmf was obtained from carlo erba co spain and used as the solvent 1 4 dioxane dx which was employed as the co solvent in the preparation of the polymeric solutions was purchased from merck co germany sodium chloride nacl and magnesium sulfate mgso4 were also supplied by merck co germany and used for the characterization of the fabricated membranes all materials were used without further purification double distilled water was used throughout the experiments 2 2 fabrication of two layer membranes pei granules were dried in a vacuum oven at 100 before use to remove all the adsorbed moisture and were kept in a desiccator after cooling a determined amount of pei was dissolved in a mixture of dmf dx with the pre determined weight ratio the dmf dx weight ratio varied from 0 3 to 0 7 for the top layer and was kept constant at 3 for the sub layer solution the dmf dx weight ratio was obtained through some preliminary experiments the results showed the lower dmf dx ratios result in better permeation fluxes and the higher dmf dx ratios lead to higher salt rejections the obtained results are in agreement with the results of kim et al 7 these preliminary experiments were based on the relation between the ratio of the solvents and pwf and nacl rejection moreover by changing the ratio of the solvents the viscosity of the polymeric solutions is changed and consequently the casting and membrane morphology are affected therefore the output of the preliminary experiments was a solvent ratio for the sub layer and a solvent ratio range for the top layer for obtaining a two layer membrane with the desirable morphology since it was desired to make a selective top layer and a porous sub layer a lower weight ratio of dmf dx was used for the top layer and a higher one for the sub layer polymeric solution the higher amount of dx in the pei polymeric solutions would result in smaller pore sizes because of their lower affinity with water and higher viscosity than dmf which in turn leads to a delayed demixing between the solvent and the non solvent in the coagulation bath 6 the polymeric solution was kept overnight at 50 on the magnetic stirrer with 300 rpm in order to make sure of complete dissolution then the solution was degassed overnight at ambient temperature before casting after complete degassing approximately 5 ml of solution a corresponding to the sub layer of the membrane was poured on a clean glass plate and around 3 ml of solution b corresponding to the top layer of the membrane was poured about 2 cm behind the first solutions on the same glass plate just between the two casting blades subsequently two different casting blades with the desired casting thicknesses were put behind the solutions the smaller casting thickness blade in front and the larger casting thickness blade at the back just after the front blade and a dual layer film on the glass plate was cast simultaneously fig 1 demonstrates the position of the blades before and during the casting of the two layer film the casting thickness for the front casting blade for the sub layer varied from 160 to 180 μm while the rear blade casting thickness was kept fixed at 200 μm so that a top layer with the thickness in the range of 20 40 μm could be formed on the sub layer while the thickness of the final cast films remained constant at 200 μm the selection of film casting thickness was mainly based on our previous experiences on the fabrication of nf and uf membranes and the reported results in the literature 25 30 33 the polymeric wet film was allowed to be at the exposure of atmospheric air for a certain time between 120 140 s at 25 2 and relative humidity of 40 5 percent to allow the solvents to evaporate from the top surface of the wet film the evaporation time was monitored vary carefully and immediately after the predetermined time the casted film was immersed into a water coagulation bath at 22 0 5 for 24 h the obtained membrane was kept at fresh distilled water for another 24 h for complete removal of the residual solvents 2 3 design of experiments design expert v 8 0 6 software was used for the experiment design three factors i e solvent co solvent weight ratio in the top layer ψ top layer casting thickness δ and evaporation time θ were selected as the effective factors and central composite design was employed 20 experiments were proposed by the software six responses i e pure water flux pwf nacl solution flux mgso4 solution flux nacl rejection mgso4 rejection and membrane porosity were chosen to investigate the performance of the fabricated two layer membranes 2 4 characterization of the membranes 2 4 1 viscosity measurement the viscosity of the polymeric solutions was measured by a brookfield viscometer model dv ii pro brookfield ametek inc usa at 25 for this purpose polymeric solutions with different concentrations were prepared and 20 ml of each solution was used for viscosity measurement 2 4 2 nanofiltration experiments fig 2 shows a schematic diagram of the nf experimental set up the feed tank was filled with 2000 ppm of the nacl or mgso4 salt solution then it was pumped through the flat plate membrane cross flow module by a high pressure rotary pump the permeate was collected for further analyses the permeate flux was determined by continuous weighing of the collected permeate during the experiment the retentate was passed through a valve in order to adjust the cross flow rate the active area of the membrane in the module was 50 cm2 5 cm w 10 cm l the operating pressure and feed flow rate were kept at 9 bars and 3 lpm respectively for all experiments eq 1 was used to calculate the pressure normalized flux of the membranes 34 1 j 1 p a δ v δ t where p is the trans membrane pressure bar a is the membrane active area m2 and δv is the volume of permeate l collected during the sampling time interval of δt h the concentration of the dissolved inorganic salt in the feed and permeate was measured by a hach conductivity meter model hq40d by assisting a calibration curve salt rejection of the membranes was calculated by eq 2 35 2 r c f c p c f 100 where c f and c p are the concentration of the inorganic salt in the feed and permeate respectively 2 4 3 sem images in order to study the effect of the studied parameters on the membrane structure sem images were taken both from the top surface and cross section of the membranes before taking the sem images the membrane samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and then sputtered by a thin layer of pure gold the images were then taken by a vega tescan scanning electron microscope czech republic with an excitation voltage of 20 kv 2 4 4 membrane porosity one of the most important characteristics for porous membranes is the available voids and channels for passing the permeate which is called porosity the most convenient reported way to measure this parameter is by the weight difference of the dry and wet membrane in order to measure the weight of the dry membrane a rectangular piece of the membrane 5 5 cm was cut and dried in a laboratory oven at 105 for 24 h the dried membrane then was weighted precisely the piece of membrane then was immersed into isopropanol ipa to fill the pores with ipa and then weighted again accurately then the porosity was calculated by eq 3 36 3 ε w w e t w d r y d i p a w w e t w d r y d i p a w d r y d p e i 100 where wwet and wdry are the weight of wet and dry membranes respectively dipa is the density of isopropanol and dpei is the density of pei 3 results and discussion 3 1 the polymer concentration in the top layer since the top layer is considered as the selective layer it was desired to have smaller pores therefore a higher polymer concentration should be used than the sub layer on the other hand an increase in the polymer concentration along with a higher content of dx would lead to an increase in viscosity of the polymeric solution high viscosities of the polymeric solution for the top layer would be a problem in the double blade casting technique since it sweeps the sub layer film 25 in all of the reported experiments for the co casting of membranes the lower viscosity solution has always been used as the top layer 22 26 while in this work the higher viscosity solution is being used as the top layer for the first time in order to tackle the issues regarding casting a polymeric solution with higher viscosity onto a lower viscosity solution an optimum solution viscosity polymer concentration should be determined for the top layer to avoid time consuming trial and error tests with different polymer concentrations the critical concentration concept which was introduced by chung and kafchinski 37 was employed they found that for every polymeric solution there is a critical concentration at which there would be a good linkage between polymeric chains so that with a small increase in polymer concentration over this critical concentration the polymeric solution viscosity would dramatically increase 37 38 the viscosity of the polymeric solutions was measured the results are shown in fig 3 the obtained results indicated that there is a critical concentration at about 19 wt of the pei at this concentration there is a good linkage between polymer chains while the viscosity of the polymeric solution has not significantly increased therefore this concentration could be used for the polymer concentration for the top layer an attempt has been made to fabricate a co casted membrane with the polymeric solution with higher polymer concentration as the top layer as it was explained in the previous paragraph 19 wt of pei was selected as the optimum pei concentration of solution b the polymer concentration for solution a was selected as 16 wt the solvent co solvent ratio was 0 5 and 3 for the top layer and sub layer respectively fig 4 shows an sem micrograph from the cross section of the resulted membrane fig 4a shows an sem micrograph from the cross section of the resulted membrane fig 4b and c is the magnification from the top layer and sub layer respectively it can be observed that a two layer membrane has been successfully formed furthermore by comparing fig 4b and c it can be seen that a much denser structure has been formed on the top layer of the membrane as a result of higher polymeric concentration in solution b the role of the solvent co solvent ratio will be discussed thoroughly in the upcoming sections 3 2 the polymer concentration in the sub layer in order to determine the polymer concentration for the sub layer different concentrations of pei in the sub layer polymeric solution solution a were examined and the permeability and salt rejection of the fabricated membranes were measured fig 5 shows the effect of the pei concentration in the sub layer while the concentration of the pei in the top layer was kept constant at 19 wt as it can be observed with an increase in polymer concentration in the sub layer a decrease in water flux alongside an enhancement in the salt rejection has resulted with an increase in polymer concentration in the sub layer the morphology of the resulted membrane starts to shift from a finger like to a sponge like structure because of delayed demixing phenomena owing to the higher viscosity of the polymer solution 39 the sem images in fig 4 show that at 16 wt pei in the sub layer few fingers are formed and nearly most of the membrane cross section has a highly porous finger sponge like morphology therefore it is predicted that if a 17 wt of pei solution is used for the sub layer the delayed demixing would become the major mechanism for phase inversion which would result in a highly sponge like morphology thus it could be expectable that a structure with apparently closed cells are formed and consequently the pwf would reduce dramatically of course applying a high concentration high viscosity layer on the sub layer during the film casting makes the membrane more susceptible to a delay demixing rather than an instantaneous demixing in the coagulation bath then by increasing the polymer concentration in the sub layer phase inversion in the top layer is also affected so that higher concentrations in the sub layer would result in thicker and denser top layers with lower permeation fluxes and higher salt rejections moreover it appears that a sponge like structure in the sub layer could be better mechanical support for the top layer 3 3 design of experiments having established the pei concentration in each layer it was desired to evaluate other affective factors on the performance of the two layer membranes for this purpose response surface methodology rsm was employed the selected factors and their ranges are summarized in table 1 the 20 proposed membranes were fabricated and the six mentioned parameters were measured through different experiments table 2 shows the obtained results from these 20 experiments 3 3 1 pure water flux among the proposed models by the software for pwf a quadratic model with an r squared equal to 0 9699 had the most agreement with the experimental data the results of the analysis of variance anova for the pwf are reported in table 3 the model f value of 35 75 demonstrates that the model is significant the p value implies that there is only a 0 01 chance that the model f value this large could happen due to noise since p values less than 0 05 show that those terms are significant it can be seen that ψ δ θ ψδ ψθ ψ2 θ2 are significant model terms in this case while the interactive effect of top layer thickness and evaporation time had no significant impact on the pure water flux in the chosen range furthermore the anova results indicate that model terms θ and ψ corresponding to evaporation time and dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer respectively had the highest impact on the pwf after neglecting insignificant parameters the proposed equation for pwf is obtained as eq 3 3 p w f 56 15 36 73 ψ 0 14 δ 0 63 θ 0 066 ψ δ 0 202 ψ θ 7 06 ψ 2 0 0018 θ 2 eq 3 shows the effect of each individual parameter and their interactive impact on the pwf the positive sign before each parameter indicates that an increase in that parameter in the investigated range would be in favor of pwf while the negative sign shows the opposite thus it can be seen from eq 3 that a decrease in solvent co solvent weight ratio i e an increase in the dx top layer casting thickness and evaporation time would result in a higher pwf an increase in interactive parameters such as solvent co solvent weight ratio and top layer casting thickness solvent co solvent weight ratio and evaporation time would be in favor of pwf this is consistent with the resulted of experimental data and will be further discussed the predicted data versus the actual experimental data for pwf are presented in fig 6 this figure shows a reasonable agreement between the predicted and experimental data as can be seen from table 3 the dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer top layer casting thickness and evaporation time have interactive effects on the pure water flux in the following we thoroughly explain these impacts fig 7 demonstrates the interactive effect of the dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer and top layer casting thickness at different evaporation times generally it can be observed that in all dmf dx weight ratios in the top layer an increase in top layer casting thickness would result in a decline in the pure water flux it could be explained that due to a higher concentration of the polymeric solution in the top layer which would lead to a denser structure 7 in this layer the higher top layer thickness would lead to higher hydraulic resistance which in turn decreases pwf another interesting point that can be seen is that the effect of top layer thickness is much more obvious in lower dmf dx ratios this phenomenon could be explained by the solubility parameters of the components table 4 summarizes the solubility parameters for pei dmf dx and di water 40 it can be seen that the solubility parameter disparity for dx i e 20 5 m p a 1 2 and water i e 47 8 m p a 1 2 is greater than dmf i e 24 9 m p a 1 2 and water thus it is less miscible with water 41 as the dmf dx ratio is decreased i e the amount of dx in the top layer solution is increased delayed demixing phase inversion occurs in the top layer due to lower affinity of dx with water which results in a denser structure 6 thus the effect of flux decline with an increase in the top layer thickness shows itself in a more significant way based on the aforementioned role of dx in the demixing of the solvent non solvent polymer system it is expected that an increase in the dmf dx weight ratio i e a decrease in the amount of dx in the top layer would result in larger pores in the top layer structure and increase the pwf however this is not the case for fig 7a and b as it can be observed from these figures higher dmf dx ratios showed lower pure water flux while lower dmf dx ratios resulted in higher water flux the reason could be found in the viscosity of the top layer solution as the dmf dx ratio decreases the viscosity of the solution rises 7 an increase in the solution viscosity would lead to lower mobility of the polymeric chains the results of previous researches show that by increasing the solution viscosity the phase inversion tends to take place through delayed demixing and denser membranes with smaller pores and lower fluxes but higher rejections would result 42 43 therefore in shorter evaporation times when there is not enough time for the formation of a thick layer on the top of the polymeric wet film by immersion in a coagulation bath large pores are formed and the pure water flux would be high whilst as it can be observed from fig 7c when the evaporation time increases a rise in dmf dx ratio leads to an increase in pure water flux this in fact indicates that in longer evaporation times when there is enough time to form a thick layer on the top of the polymeric wet film the role of dx would be as expected before furthermore dx is much more volatile than dmf 44 hence at longer evaporation times and higher amounts of dx it evaporates more quickly from the top of the casted film leaving a very high polymer concentration on top of the film which leads to a more packed structure on the top layer and thus lower values of water flux we tested the membranes with nacl and mgso4 salt solutions and it was observed that variation in the flux of nacl and mgso4 solutions with variation in selected factors exhibited the same trend as pure water flux however they were both lower than pure water flux which is reasonable 3 3 2 salt rejection the quadratic model with an r squared equal to 0 7535 was proposed by the software for nacl rejection the results of anova for nacl rejection are reported in table 5 the model f value of 3 4 demonstrates that the model is significant the p value implies that there is only a 3 51 chance that a model f value this large could occur due to noise since p values less than 0 05 show that those terms are significant it can be seen that ψ θ ψ 2 are significant model terms in this case while top layer thickness was not as significant as other parameters regarding nacl rejection in the chosen range similar to pure water flux the results of anova demonstrate that model terms θ and ψ which correspond to evaporation time and dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer respectively had the highest impact on the nacl rejection after neglecting insignificant parameters the proposed equation for nacl rejection is as follows 4 n a c l rejection 347 19 66 90 ψ 0 756 δ 5 61 θ 0 043 ψ δ 1 49 ψ θ 0 01 δ θ 0 024 θ 2 111 46 ψ 2 as mentioned before the positive or negative signs before each parameter in eq 4 show that increasing that parameter would be in favor of nacl rejection of the membranes or vice versa fig 8 depicts the predicted data versus the actual experimental data a reasonable agreement between actual and predicted data can be observed from this figure fig 9 demonstrates the interactive effect of dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer and also top layer casting thickness and evaporation times on nacl rejection by the corresponding fabricated membranes it can be seen that an increase in the top layer casting thickness from 20 μm to 40 μm leads to a slight increase in nacl rejection which can be attributed to the increase of the selective layer thickness this is in agreement with the analysis of variance which was presented in table 5 as for the dmf dx weight ratio ψ it is observed that lower ψs resulted in lower nacl rejections this could be related to the effect of solvent type on the phase inversion mechanism as mentioned in the previous section low solubility parameters disparity of polymer and solvent shows a low tendency for phase separation in nips bath and the resultant membrane would have sponge like morphology on the other side the high solubility parameter disparity of polymer and solvent shows a high tendency for phase separation in the nips bath and the final membrane would have a finger like morphology 45 in the current study the solubility parameter disparity of dmf pei and dx pei is 1 4 and 3 0 respectively therefore the higher ψ values higher dmf percent in the solvent mixture would result in a more sponge like morphology while lower ψ higher dx percent in the solvent mixture would result in a more finger like morphology it is clear that the faster phase inversion applies higher stress to the membrane surface during phase inversion in the nips bath the higher stress causes the formation of high porosity membranes with non uniform pores and lower skin on top layer while the lower stress causes the formation of the membranes with lower porosity with more uniform pores and thicker top layer skin through slower phase separation it could be clearly observed in figs 7 and 9 that by increasing the ratio of the solvents pwf decreased and salt rejection increased moreover the evaporation time and solvent ratio play important roles in the formation of membrane structure lower the ratio of the solvents ψ and higher evaporation time cause the increase of polymeric solution viscosity therefore by the increase of evaporation time and the ratio of the solvents more spongy structure with lower pwf but higher salt rejections are expected as shown in figs 7 and 9 also by the increase of the evaporation time the viscosity of the polymeric solution especially at the film top surface becomes so high that it increases the phase inversion time considerably and results in the low porosity membranes with nearly constant water flux and high salt rejection the water flux is less sensitive to top layer casting thickness and the ratio of the solvents but the salt rejection becomes more sensitive to the top layer casting thickness and the ratio of the solvents this shows the as the evaporation time increases the pwf is mainly controlled by the membrane porosity while the salt rejection is governed by the membrane pore size 46 the quadratic model with an r squared equal to 0 7927 was proposed by the software for mgso4 rejection the results of anova for mgso4 rejection are reported in table 6 the model f value of 4 25 proves that the model is significant the p value implies that there is only a 1 7 chance that a model f value this large could occur due to noise it can be seen that ψ θ ψ 2 θ2 are significant model terms since their p value is less than 0 05 while top layer thickness δ was not as significant as other parameters regarding mgso4 rejection in the selected range similar to nacl rejection the anova demonstrates that model terms θ and ψ which correspond to evaporation time and dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer respectively had the highest impact on the mgso4 rejection after neglecting insignificant parameters the proposed equation for mgso4 rejection is as follows 5 m g s o 4 r e j e c t i o n 490 08 91 63 ψ 7 61 θ 127 19 ψ 2 0 03 θ 2 the behavior of the membranes regarding mgso4 rejection had the same pattern as the nacl rejection nevertheless mgso4 rejection values were higher than nacl rejection since the bivalent hydrated ionic salt is bigger than the monovalent salt 3 3 3 porosity among various proposed models by the software for the porosity of the fabricated membranes a quadratic model with an r square of 0 7490 had the most agreement with the experimental data table 7 represents the analysis of variance for this model the f value equal to 3 32 implies that the model is significant this is while there is only a 3 78 chance that this f value could occur due to noise among different parameters it can be seen that top layer thickness δ had the most significant effect on porosity with an f value and a p value equal to 14 11 and 0 0037 respectively after neglecting insignificant parameters the proposed equation for porosity is as follows 6 p o r o s i t y 125 28 63 ψ 0 27 δ 12 4 ψ 2 once again the negative sign before the top layer thickness δ indicates that increasing the top layer thickness would result in smaller porosity values the reason will be explained in the following section fig 10 demonstrates the predicted data for porosity versus the actual experimental data a reasonable agreement between actual and predicted data can be observed from this figure fig 11 shows the interactive effects of dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer and top layer thickness on the porosity of membranes lower polymer concentration on one hand and higher dmf dx weight ratios in the sub layer on the other hand led to the formation of macro voids in this layer these macro voids contribute the most to the membrane porosity since total casting thickness for the membrane was set at 200 μm as top layer casting thickness increased sub layer casting thickness would decrease therefore as can be observed from fig 11 an increase in top layer casting thickness resulted in a decline in membrane porosity because the concentration of the casting solution for top layer is higher than the sub layer the morphology of the top layer should be more sponge like with smaller pores because of the higher delayed demixing phase inversion respect to the sub layer 45 on the other hand the phase inversion in the flat membranes is started from the top surface during the immersion in the nips bath the nucleation followed by solidification causes a migration of the polymer chains from the lower parts of the film to the surface that makes a higher density porous solid at the surface polymer rich and lower concentration polymer solution at the lower parts solvent rich the dilute solution forms a highly spongy morphology with large pores macropores during the solidification by the non solvent formation mechanism of the asymmetric integrated skin membranes 47 the apparent porosity that is commonly measured by immersing in low surface tension low viscosity and low volatility liquid typically isopropyl alcohol ipa could measure the porosity corresponding to the large pores larger than 50 nm then the reported porosities are mainly due to the porosity of the sub layer and lower part of the top layer as it could be observed in the sem images in fig 12 moreover it can be noted that decreasing the dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer would also result in lower porosity the reason as explained before is that lower weight ratios of dmf dx cause delayed demixing phase separation which in turn would lead to denser structures in the top layer thus it would decrease membrane porosity as for the interactive effect of dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer and top layer thickness it is evident that top layer thickness has a more severe effect on the membrane porosity in lower dmf dx weight ratios as expected top layer casting thickness can have a more significant effect in membrane porosity when it has a denser structure 3 3 4 optimization of the design parameters numerical optimization was performed on the models in order to determine the optimum values for the design parameters the optimization was performed for two cases in case 1 the goal was to maximize nacl rejection since it is a representative for the performance of a membrane in a separation process however higher salt rejection is usually a trade off for lower permeability therefore in case 2 the goal was set to maximize both nacl rejection and pwf simultaneously with the same level of importance table 8 represents both optimization cases and the resultant responses which were proposed by the software the desirability value can range from zero to one it shows the degree to which the proposed response is in accordance with the goal the desirability equal to 1 for case 1 shows that the proposed response is well in accordance with the goal which was maximizing nacl rejection in the studied range however since the goal for case 2 was to maximize both water flux and nacl rejection and because both of them cannot be met at the same time the maximum desirability in this case is not more than 0 536 as it was expected for case 1 the maximum value of nacl rejection could be achieved in higher evaporation time and top layer thickness a comparison of the fabrication conditions for the case 1 and case 2 reveals that besides the changes in the sub layer structure induced by the top layer in the two cases the top layer itself is responsible for this considerable difference in permeability and salt rejection in case 1 the ratio of the solvents i e ψ is 0 62 which shows more tendency for the formation of sponge like structure through delayed demixing phase separation in case 2 ψ is 0 4 which shows a lower tendency for the formation of a sponge like structure the sub layer condition for the two membranes is the same except the thickness the dmf dx ratio in the sub layer is 3 0 which shows a very low tendency for phase inversion then the sub layer would have a highly sponge like morphology the evaporation time for case 1 and case 2 is 140 and 120 s respectively this shows that the solvent content at the surface layer at the time of immersion in the nips bath for case 1 is much less than in case 2 in better words the viscosity of the top layer for case 1 would be higher than case 2 at the time of immersion in the nips water bath also the top layer casting thickness for case 1 40 μm is higher than that for case 2 20 μm therefore the phase inversion at the top layer for case 2 takes place with less delay than case 1 then the top layer thickness of the final membrane in case 2 is expected to be much lower than those in case 1 the sem images of the cross section of the case 1 and case 2 membranes clearly shows the mentioned differences between the structures of the two membranes overall the origin of deterioration of salt rejection and increase of water permeability of case 2 compared to case 1 is the lower thickness and higher porosity of the top layer in case 2 induced by the lower viscosity and lower thickness of the top layer confirmation experiments were carried out in order to verify the proposed condition at optimum conditions for each case the results of verification tests are shown in table 9 indicate good agreement between the predicted results and the experimental results for both cases as was expected in the case 1 scenario since all the effective parameters were in favor of salt rejection a high nacl rejection with low water flux was achieved however in case 2 as pure water flux comes into play effective parameters should alter in a way to meet the middle ground between water flux and nacl rejection fig 12 shows the sem cross section and top surface image of both cases fig 12a and b are different magnification images taken from the cross section of the membrane fabricated by case 1 parameters fig 12d and e show images with different magnification taken from the cross section of the membrane fabricated by case 2 parameters fig 12c and f depict the images taken from the top surface of the membrane fabricated by the fabrication parameters of case 1 and case 2 respectively it can be observed that a two layer membrane with a dense top layer and a porous sub layer has successfully formed in both cases the evaporation time before immersing the membranes into the coagulation bath resulted in partial evaporation of solvent from the top of the polymeric film which consequently formed a thin and dense layer over this polymeric wet film that induced greater resistance against solvent exchange in the coagulation bath therefore as a result of delayed demixing a sponge like structure has been formed in the sub layer rather than a finger like structure 48 moreover the lower concentration of polymer in the sub layer on one hand and a higher ratio of dmf dx on the other hand has led to the formation of a very porous structure with low hydraulic resistance however a higher polymer content and lower dmf dx ratio in the top layer resulted in the formation of a very dense and selective top layer fig 12a and b show the cross sectional sem image of two different membranes with top layer casting thickness of 40 μm and 20 μm respectively the sem images show that when the top layer casting thickness is selected as 40 μm case 1 the final membrane top layer thickness is about 5 9 μm while for the case 2 membranes which have a top layer casting thickness of 20 μm the final membrane top layer thickness is only 2 3 μm the lower top layer thickness would result in lower hydraulic resistance and therefore higher pwfs which could be observed from the permeation results of case 1 and case 2 membranes it is also clear that the thickness of the top layer in case 1 is more than case 2 which is due to higher casting thickness considered for the fabrication of the membrane in this case in addition to shorter evaporation time the greater flux in case 2 could be attributed to a thinner top layer which resulted in less hydraulic resistance rather than case 1 with a thicker top layer the dmf dx ratio in the top layer for case 1 was higher than case 2 which means that the rate of solvent exchange was faster for case 1 therefore shorter coarsening time in this case before vitrification could lead to smaller nodule size 49 and hence a smoother surface can be formed 4 conclusion a double blade casting technique was used as an efficient way to fabricate two layer integrated skin polyetherimide nanofiltration membranes since different polymeric solutions were used for each layer the polymer concentration was determined independently for each one the effect of the design parameters such as dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer top layer thickness and evaporation time was studied in detail using response surface methodology it has been shown that 19 wt of pei could be considered as the critical concentration in the top layer since there is a good linkage between polymeric chains in the solution while its viscosity has not dramatically increased although higher polymer content in the top layer solution could result in a denser and more selective top layer it could sweep the sub layer in the double blade casting method analysis of variance implied that the evaporation time had the most significant effect on the pure water flux and rejection characteristics of the two layer membranes moreover it was found that the top layer thickness was of great importance regarding membrane porosity two cases for optimization of the design parameters were examined and compared with the predicted data case 1 was designed to maximize nacl rejection the resultant membrane had a nacl rejection equal to 25 7 in case 2 the goal was to maximize both nacl rejection and pure water flux simultaneously in this case the resultant membrane had a pure water flux and nacl rejection equal to 1 47 l m2h bar and 13 6 respectively depending on the polymer type fabrication method additives post treatment etc very different water fluxes has been reported in literature in the range of 0 12 1 46 l m2 h bar 50 0 96 5 04 l m2 h bar 51 1 7 9 5 l m2 h bar 52 1 2 2 6 l m2 h bar 53 and 0 2 2 2 l m2 h bar 54 although the obtained water fluxes in the current study seem to be at the lower range of flux in nanofiltration membranes it should be noted that the presented method is a facile single step technique to fabricate asymmetric integrated skin nanofiltration membranes and with simple modifications in the studied parameters it could be used as a support layer for membrane fabrication using interfacial polymerization to gain both higher water flux and salt rejection overall it seems that the double blade casting technique provides more control over the membrane morphological structure and with the tuning of the design parameters a membrane with the desired characteristics could be formed nevertheless we believe that this study could be considered as a starting point for this method and certainly it needs to be developed by the other researches of the field of membrane fabrication declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing for financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
14108,polyetherimide nanofiltration membranes were fabricated by the double blade casting technique throughout this technique the application of different compositions for the top layer and sub layer polymeric solution becomes possible and therefore it could be used as an effective tool for controlling the morphology of the membranes the preliminary experiments showed that the highest polymer concentration for the sub layer for obtaining a suitable morphology and low hydraulic resistance and a defect free selective top layer is 16 and 19 wt respectively the effect of membrane fabrication parameters i e solvent co solvent weight ratio in the top layer ψ top layer casting thickness δ and evaporation time θ on the performance of the membranes was evaluated and optimized using the rsm method twenty experiments were proposed by the rsm design of experiments method the experiments were done and 20 membranes were fabricated at the proposed conditions the membranes were evaluated for pure water flux nacl and mgso4 rejection and flux and porosity the analysis of variance anova indicated that evaporation time had the most significant impact on the flux and rejection whilst porosity was most affected by top layer thickness finally two options for the optimization of the fabrication condition were considered in case 1 membrane fabrication parameters were optimized for attaining maximum nacl rejection and in case 2 both flux and nacl rejection were considered as the targets for optimization for case 1 the best salt rejection was obtained as 25 7 at a permeate flux of 0 38 l m2h bar and in case 2 the optimum values for salt rejection and flux were obtained at 13 6 and 1 47 l m2h bar respectively reasonable agreements were observed between the predicted and actual

solvent weight ratio in the top layer 1 introduction in the past few decades membrane technologies have been recognized as one of the most reliable and effective processes in water and wastewater treatment based on the pore size of the membranes and their operational conditions these processes are categorized into different categories including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro etc nanofiltration membranes with a pore size ranging from 0 5 to 2 nm are considered as an intermediate level between uf and ro while these membranes benefit from higher fluxes than ro membranes they show higher rejection than uf membranes 1 these characteristics have made nanofiltration a suitable and economically efficient separation process with relatively high flux 2 the separation mechanism in the commercial tfc nanofiltration membranes is based on both size and donnan exclusions while the integrated skin membranes are only based on the size exclusion mechanism 3 polyetherimide pei is a suitable material for the fabrication of both porous and non porous membranes from microfiltration to gas separation because of its unique chemical structure high mechanical strength and thermal and chemical stability 4 15 the non solvent induced phase separation nips technique is the most commonly used method for the fabrication of integrated skin asymmetric porous nanofiltration membranes 16 17 in this method the polymeric solution is cast on a support or a glass plate and then immersed in a non solvent coagulation bath to form an asymmetric porous membrane with or without a selective top layer depending on the fabrication condition 18 19 this method is ideal for fabrication of microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes but for fabrication of nanofiltration membranes due to needing to high concentrations of the polymer solution it has some drawbacks such as low porosity high hydraulic resistance against permeation and highly difficult the control of both the pore size and the top layer skin thickness 20 for fabrication of integrated skin nf membranes it is necessary to keep the concentration of polymeric solution high enough through which small pores in the range of 0 5 2 nm are formed at this condition a very thick support layer with low porosity small pores and high hydraulic resistance are formed if the concentration of the polymeric solution is low the pore size of the top layer would be larger than the desired range for nf membranes therefore dual layer casting is proposed in which two different polymeric solutions are cast simultaneously by a double blade film casting device to form a dual layer film e g sub layer and top layer this is unlike the conventional film casting method in which a single layer film is cast and immersed in the phase inversion condition to form symmetric or asymmetric porous membrane or the sub layer is fabricated and then a selective layer is cast onto the sub layer to form a composite membrane 21 since the polymeric solutions have their own properties and specifications such as the miscibility of the solvent and non solvent polymer concentration and possible presence of additives each layer shows its own behavior in the phase separation stage consequently this technique makes better control over the morphological structure of different layers possible while there is good adhesion between them furthermore in this manner it becomes possible to use a polymeric solution having a higher concentration for the selective top layer and a solution with lower concentration for the support layer to produce a selective top layer and porous support with lower hydraulic resistance 22 23 due to some restrictions of this method few studies have been performed for only limited applications delamination of the layers is a serious defect in the membranes fabricated by this method pereira et al 22 fabricated two layer porous membranes for the first time by a double blade casting knife followed by nips in the water bath they used polyetherimide pei and polyethersulfone pes as the polymers and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp and tetrahydrofuran thf as the solvents they found that when the two polymeric solution compositions are far from their binodal curves there is not enough time for inter diffusion of the solutions and therefore delamination occurs li et al 24 fabricated dual layer pei psf porous membranes by co casting of pei and psf dissolved in nmp as the top layer and sub layer respectively and indicated the source of adhesion and delamination in the two layer membranes and indicated that the difference between the shrinkage values of the layers is the most influential factor in delamination of the layers hashemifard et al 25 decreased the delamination of the layers by addition of pei in the sub layer of pei pei pes integrated skin dual layer flat sheet membranes fabricated by the double blade casting technique they used nmp as the common solvent and studied the effects of pei concentration in the top layer the viscosity and pei pes ratio in the sub layer as the most crucial parameters in the final membrane performance they concluded that the application of incompatible polymers for the support layer would result in macro void formation which increases gas permeability liu and ng 23 fabricated psf single and dual layer membranes by the co casting of psf in dmf solutions with different concentrations and showed that when the same polymer and solvent is used in both layers delamination would not occur they obtained higher water fluxes from the dual layer membranes in comparison to the single layer membranes with the same polymer concentration the double blade casting technique has also reported being used for the fabrication of super hydrophobic pvdf membrane via vips technique for application in the vacuum membrane distillation process 26 through this method the fabrication of a micro porous thin layer with a narrow pore size supported by a highly porous sub layer becomes possible xia et al 27 have reported the fabrication of a delamination free dual layer psf pes pi and pei membranes using nmp dmf and dmac solvents by the co casting technique they showed that the origin of the delamination is the difference in hydrophobicity of the layers and delamination could be prevented by control of the hydrophobicity by adjusting the thickness and solvent content of each layer altun et al 28 investigated the effect evaporation time and also the influence of adding co solvent to the polymeric solution on membrane morphology of polysulfone based membranes they showed that by increasing the evaporation time before entering the cast polymeric film into the coagulation bath the permeability would decrease but better rejection characteristics could be obtained the rejection of rose bengal solution in isopropanol increased from around 60 90 when the evaporation time was increased from 0 to 100 s in presence of 1 4 dioxane dx or thf as a co solvent they also observed the same behavior when they increased the co solvent solvent ratio from 0 100 to 100 0 wu et al 29 fabricated pvc pvc g pegma blend membranes and observed that by the addition of thf as the co solvent the rejection was increased but the permeability decreased considerably from the above mentioned studies it could be concluded that delamination could be prevented by using the same polymer and solvent in the two layers moreover evaporation time and co solvent concentration are useful parameters for controlling the permeability and rejection of dual layer membranes fabricated by co casting technique therefore in this paper the co casting technique was used for the fabrication of integrated skin asymmetric pei nanofiltration membranes as a facile single step method where the selective top layer and porous sub layer are going to have different compositions and or characteristics this is a unique technique that enabled us to fabricate membranes with the desired morphological structures as compared to the conventional composite membranes where a support layer is fabricated at first and then the selective layer is cast or coated on it this method is much simpler and faster moreover this method does not cause pore blocking of the sub layer which is very common through the intrusion of coating solution on the porous substrates during the fabrication of the composite membranes additionally in all the previous studies performed on the co casting fabrication of membranes the highly concentrated polymeric solution higher viscosity has always been cast as the bottom and the lower polymer content solution lower viscosity cast as the top layer in the current research it is for the first time that the lower concentration polymeric solution is used as the sub layer and the higher concentration polymeric solution is applied as the top layer in addition the introduction of two more parameters i e top layer casting thickness and top layer solution concentration make the fabrication of tailor made membranes for different applications possible maximizing salt rejection or optimizing permeability or both in this regard the effect of polymeric concentration in each layer solvent co solvent ratio evaporation time and the top layer thickness on the membrane characteristics and performance were studied and optimized using response surface methodology rsm design of experiments method 2 materials and method 2 1 materials ultem 1000 polyetherimide pei mw 50 921 g mol 25 was supplied from general electric company usa n n dimethyl formamide dmf was obtained from carlo erba co spain and used as the solvent 1 4 dioxane dx which was employed as the co solvent in the preparation of the polymeric solutions was purchased from merck co germany sodium chloride nacl and magnesium sulfate mgso4 were also supplied by merck co germany and used for the characterization of the fabricated membranes all materials were used without further purification double distilled water was used throughout the experiments 2 2 fabrication of two layer membranes pei granules were dried in a vacuum oven at 100 before use to remove all the adsorbed moisture and were kept in a desiccator after cooling a determined amount of pei was dissolved in a mixture of dmf dx with the pre determined weight ratio the dmf dx weight ratio varied from 0 3 to 0 7 for the top layer and was kept constant at 3 for the sub layer solution the dmf dx weight ratio was obtained through some preliminary experiments the results showed the lower dmf dx ratios result in better permeation fluxes and the higher dmf dx ratios lead to higher salt rejections the obtained results are in agreement with the results of kim et al 7 these preliminary experiments were based on the relation between the ratio of the solvents and pwf and nacl rejection moreover by changing the ratio of the solvents the viscosity of the polymeric solutions is changed and consequently the casting and membrane morphology are affected therefore the output of the preliminary experiments was a solvent ratio for the sub layer and a solvent ratio range for the top layer for obtaining a two layer membrane with the desirable morphology since it was desired to make a selective top layer and a porous sub layer a lower weight ratio of dmf dx was used for the top layer and a higher one for the sub layer polymeric solution the higher amount of dx in the pei polymeric solutions would result in smaller pore sizes because of their lower affinity with water and higher viscosity than dmf which in turn leads to a delayed demixing between the solvent and the non solvent in the coagulation bath 6 the polymeric solution was kept overnight at 50 on the magnetic stirrer with 300 rpm in order to make sure of complete dissolution then the solution was degassed overnight at ambient temperature before casting after complete degassing approximately 5 ml of solution a corresponding to the sub layer of the membrane was poured on a clean glass plate and around 3 ml of solution b corresponding to the top layer of the membrane was poured about 2 cm behind the first solutions on the same glass plate just between the two casting blades subsequently two different casting blades with the desired casting thicknesses were put behind the solutions the smaller casting thickness blade in front and the larger casting thickness blade at the back just after the front blade and a dual layer film on the glass plate was cast simultaneously fig 1 demonstrates the position of the blades before and during the casting of the two layer film the casting thickness for the front casting blade for the sub layer varied from 160 to 180 μm while the rear blade casting thickness was kept fixed at 200 μm so that a top layer with the thickness in the range of 20 40 μm could be formed on the sub layer while the thickness of the final cast films remained constant at 200 μm the selection of film casting thickness was mainly based on our previous experiences on the fabrication of nf and uf membranes and the reported results in the literature 25 30 33 the polymeric wet film was allowed to be at the exposure of atmospheric air for a certain time between 120 140 s at 25 2 and relative humidity of 40 5 percent to allow the solvents to evaporate from the top surface of the wet film the evaporation time was monitored vary carefully and immediately after the predetermined time the casted film was immersed into a water coagulation bath at 22 0 5 for 24 h the obtained membrane was kept at fresh distilled water for another 24 h for complete removal of the residual solvents 2 3 design of experiments design expert v 8 0 6 software was used for the experiment design three factors i e solvent co solvent weight ratio in the top layer ψ top layer casting thickness δ and evaporation time θ were selected as the effective factors and central composite design was employed 20 experiments were proposed by the software six responses i e pure water flux pwf nacl solution flux mgso4 solution flux nacl rejection mgso4 rejection and membrane porosity were chosen to investigate the performance of the fabricated two layer membranes 2 4 characterization of the membranes 2 4 1 viscosity measurement the viscosity of the polymeric solutions was measured by a brookfield viscometer model dv ii pro brookfield ametek inc usa at 25 for this purpose polymeric solutions with different concentrations were prepared and 20 ml of each solution was used for viscosity measurement 2 4 2 nanofiltration experiments fig 2 shows a schematic diagram of the nf experimental set up the feed tank was filled with 2000 ppm of the nacl or mgso4 salt solution then it was pumped through the flat plate membrane cross flow module by a high pressure rotary pump the permeate was collected for further analyses the permeate flux was determined by continuous weighing of the collected permeate during the experiment the retentate was passed through a valve in order to adjust the cross flow rate the active area of the membrane in the module was 50 cm2 5 cm w 10 cm l the operating pressure and feed flow rate were kept at 9 bars and 3 lpm respectively for all experiments eq 1 was used to calculate the pressure normalized flux of the membranes 34 1 j 1 p a δ v δ t where p is the trans membrane pressure bar a is the membrane active area m2 and δv is the volume of permeate l collected during the sampling time interval of δt h the concentration of the dissolved inorganic salt in the feed and permeate was measured by a hach conductivity meter model hq40d by assisting a calibration curve salt rejection of the membranes was calculated by eq 2 35 2 r c f c p c f 100 where c f and c p are the concentration of the inorganic salt in the feed and permeate respectively 2 4 3 sem images in order to study the effect of the studied parameters on the membrane structure sem images were taken both from the top surface and cross section of the membranes before taking the sem images the membrane samples were fractured in liquid nitrogen and then sputtered by a thin layer of pure gold the images were then taken by a vega tescan scanning electron microscope czech republic with an excitation voltage of 20 kv 2 4 4 membrane porosity one of the most important characteristics for porous membranes is the available voids and channels for passing the permeate which is called porosity the most convenient reported way to measure this parameter is by the weight difference of the dry and wet membrane in order to measure the weight of the dry membrane a rectangular piece of the membrane 5 5 cm was cut and dried in a laboratory oven at 105 for 24 h the dried membrane then was weighted precisely the piece of membrane then was immersed into isopropanol ipa to fill the pores with ipa and then weighted again accurately then the porosity was calculated by eq 3 36 3 ε w w e t w d r y d i p a w w e t w d r y d i p a w d r y d p e i 100 where wwet and wdry are the weight of wet and dry membranes respectively dipa is the density of isopropanol and dpei is the density of pei 3 results and discussion 3 1 the polymer concentration in the top layer since the top layer is considered as the selective layer it was desired to have smaller pores therefore a higher polymer concentration should be used than the sub layer on the other hand an increase in the polymer concentration along with a higher content of dx would lead to an increase in viscosity of the polymeric solution high viscosities of the polymeric solution for the top layer would be a problem in the double blade casting technique since it sweeps the sub layer film 25 in all of the reported experiments for the co casting of membranes the lower viscosity solution has always been used as the top layer 22 26 while in this work the higher viscosity solution is being used as the top layer for the first time in order to tackle the issues regarding casting a polymeric solution with higher viscosity onto a lower viscosity solution an optimum solution viscosity polymer concentration should be determined for the top layer to avoid time consuming trial and error tests with different polymer concentrations the critical concentration concept which was introduced by chung and kafchinski 37 was employed they found that for every polymeric solution there is a critical concentration at which there would be a good linkage between polymeric chains so that with a small increase in polymer concentration over this critical concentration the polymeric solution viscosity would dramatically increase 37 38 the viscosity of the polymeric solutions was measured the results are shown in fig 3 the obtained results indicated that there is a critical concentration at about 19 wt of the pei at this concentration there is a good linkage between polymer chains while the viscosity of the polymeric solution has not significantly increased therefore this concentration could be used for the polymer concentration for the top layer an attempt has been made to fabricate a co casted membrane with the polymeric solution with higher polymer concentration as the top layer as it was explained in the previous paragraph 19 wt of pei was selected as the optimum pei concentration of solution b the polymer concentration for solution a was selected as 16 wt the solvent co solvent ratio was 0 5 and 3 for the top layer and sub layer respectively fig 4 shows an sem micrograph from the cross section of the resulted membrane fig 4a shows an sem micrograph from the cross section of the resulted membrane fig 4b and c is the magnification from the top layer and sub layer respectively it can be observed that a two layer membrane has been successfully formed furthermore by comparing fig 4b and c it can be seen that a much denser structure has been formed on the top layer of the membrane as a result of higher polymeric concentration in solution b the role of the solvent co solvent ratio will be discussed thoroughly in the upcoming sections 3 2 the polymer concentration in the sub layer in order to determine the polymer concentration for the sub layer different concentrations of pei in the sub layer polymeric solution solution a were examined and the permeability and salt rejection of the fabricated membranes were measured fig 5 shows the effect of the pei concentration in the sub layer while the concentration of the pei in the top layer was kept constant at 19 wt as it can be observed with an increase in polymer concentration in the sub layer a decrease in water flux alongside an enhancement in the salt rejection has resulted with an increase in polymer concentration in the sub layer the morphology of the resulted membrane starts to shift from a finger like to a sponge like structure because of delayed demixing phenomena owing to the higher viscosity of the polymer solution 39 the sem images in fig 4 show that at 16 wt pei in the sub layer few fingers are formed and nearly most of the membrane cross section has a highly porous finger sponge like morphology therefore it is predicted that if a 17 wt of pei solution is used for the sub layer the delayed demixing would become the major mechanism for phase inversion which would result in a highly sponge like morphology thus it could be expectable that a structure with apparently closed cells are formed and consequently the pwf would reduce dramatically of course applying a high concentration high viscosity layer on the sub layer during the film casting makes the membrane more susceptible to a delay demixing rather than an instantaneous demixing in the coagulation bath then by increasing the polymer concentration in the sub layer phase inversion in the top layer is also affected so that higher concentrations in the sub layer would result in thicker and denser top layers with lower permeation fluxes and higher salt rejections moreover it appears that a sponge like structure in the sub layer could be better mechanical support for the top layer 3 3 design of experiments having established the pei concentration in each layer it was desired to evaluate other affective factors on the performance of the two layer membranes for this purpose response surface methodology rsm was employed the selected factors and their ranges are summarized in table 1 the 20 proposed membranes were fabricated and the six mentioned parameters were measured through different experiments table 2 shows the obtained results from these 20 experiments 3 3 1 pure water flux among the proposed models by the software for pwf a quadratic model with an r squared equal to 0 9699 had the most agreement with the experimental data the results of the analysis of variance anova for the pwf are reported in table 3 the model f value of 35 75 demonstrates that the model is significant the p value implies that there is only a 0 01 chance that the model f value this large could happen due to noise since p values less than 0 05 show that those terms are significant it can be seen that ψ δ θ ψδ ψθ ψ2 θ2 are significant model terms in this case while the interactive effect of top layer thickness and evaporation time had no significant impact on the pure water flux in the chosen range furthermore the anova results indicate that model terms θ and ψ corresponding to evaporation time and dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer respectively had the highest impact on the pwf after neglecting insignificant parameters the proposed equation for pwf is obtained as eq 3 3 p w f 56 15 36 73 ψ 0 14 δ 0 63 θ 0 066 ψ δ 0 202 ψ θ 7 06 ψ 2 0 0018 θ 2 eq 3 shows the effect of each individual parameter and their interactive impact on the pwf the positive sign before each parameter indicates that an increase in that parameter in the investigated range would be in favor of pwf while the negative sign shows the opposite thus it can be seen from eq 3 that a decrease in solvent co solvent weight ratio i e an increase in the dx top layer casting thickness and evaporation time would result in a higher pwf an increase in interactive parameters such as solvent co solvent weight ratio and top layer casting thickness solvent co solvent weight ratio and evaporation time would be in favor of pwf this is consistent with the resulted of experimental data and will be further discussed the predicted data versus the actual experimental data for pwf are presented in fig 6 this figure shows a reasonable agreement between the predicted and experimental data as can be seen from table 3 the dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer top layer casting thickness and evaporation time have interactive effects on the pure water flux in the following we thoroughly explain these impacts fig 7 demonstrates the interactive effect of the dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer and top layer casting thickness at different evaporation times generally it can be observed that in all dmf dx weight ratios in the top layer an increase in top layer casting thickness would result in a decline in the pure water flux it could be explained that due to a higher concentration of the polymeric solution in the top layer which would lead to a denser structure 7 in this layer the higher top layer thickness would lead to higher hydraulic resistance which in turn decreases pwf another interesting point that can be seen is that the effect of top layer thickness is much more obvious in lower dmf dx ratios this phenomenon could be explained by the solubility parameters of the components table 4 summarizes the solubility parameters for pei dmf dx and di water 40 it can be seen that the solubility parameter disparity for dx i e 20 5 m p a 1 2 and water i e 47 8 m p a 1 2 is greater than dmf i e 24 9 m p a 1 2 and water thus it is less miscible with water 41 as the dmf dx ratio is decreased i e the amount of dx in the top layer solution is increased delayed demixing phase inversion occurs in the top layer due to lower affinity of dx with water which results in a denser structure 6 thus the effect of flux decline with an increase in the top layer thickness shows itself in a more significant way based on the aforementioned role of dx in the demixing of the solvent non solvent polymer system it is expected that an increase in the dmf dx weight ratio i e a decrease in the amount of dx in the top layer would result in larger pores in the top layer structure and increase the pwf however this is not the case for fig 7a and b as it can be observed from these figures higher dmf dx ratios showed lower pure water flux while lower dmf dx ratios resulted in higher water flux the reason could be found in the viscosity of the top layer solution as the dmf dx ratio decreases the viscosity of the solution rises 7 an increase in the solution viscosity would lead to lower mobility of the polymeric chains the results of previous researches show that by increasing the solution viscosity the phase inversion tends to take place through delayed demixing and denser membranes with smaller pores and lower fluxes but higher rejections would result 42 43 therefore in shorter evaporation times when there is not enough time for the formation of a thick layer on the top of the polymeric wet film by immersion in a coagulation bath large pores are formed and the pure water flux would be high whilst as it can be observed from fig 7c when the evaporation time increases a rise in dmf dx ratio leads to an increase in pure water flux this in fact indicates that in longer evaporation times when there is enough time to form a thick layer on the top of the polymeric wet film the role of dx would be as expected before furthermore dx is much more volatile than dmf 44 hence at longer evaporation times and higher amounts of dx it evaporates more quickly from the top of the casted film leaving a very high polymer concentration on top of the film which leads to a more packed structure on the top layer and thus lower values of water flux we tested the membranes with nacl and mgso4 salt solutions and it was observed that variation in the flux of nacl and mgso4 solutions with variation in selected factors exhibited the same trend as pure water flux however they were both lower than pure water flux which is reasonable 3 3 2 salt rejection the quadratic model with an r squared equal to 0 7535 was proposed by the software for nacl rejection the results of anova for nacl rejection are reported in table 5 the model f value of 3 4 demonstrates that the model is significant the p value implies that there is only a 3 51 chance that a model f value this large could occur due to noise since p values less than 0 05 show that those terms are significant it can be seen that ψ θ ψ 2 are significant model terms in this case while top layer thickness was not as significant as other parameters regarding nacl rejection in the chosen range similar to pure water flux the results of anova demonstrate that model terms θ and ψ which correspond to evaporation time and dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer respectively had the highest impact on the nacl rejection after neglecting insignificant parameters the proposed equation for nacl rejection is as follows 4 n a c l rejection 347 19 66 90 ψ 0 756 δ 5 61 θ 0 043 ψ δ 1 49 ψ θ 0 01 δ θ 0 024 θ 2 111 46 ψ 2 as mentioned before the positive or negative signs before each parameter in eq 4 show that increasing that parameter would be in favor of nacl rejection of the membranes or vice versa fig 8 depicts the predicted data versus the actual experimental data a reasonable agreement between actual and predicted data can be observed from this figure fig 9 demonstrates the interactive effect of dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer and also top layer casting thickness and evaporation times on nacl rejection by the corresponding fabricated membranes it can be seen that an increase in the top layer casting thickness from 20 μm to 40 μm leads to a slight increase in nacl rejection which can be attributed to the increase of the selective layer thickness this is in agreement with the analysis of variance which was presented in table 5 as for the dmf dx weight ratio ψ it is observed that lower ψs resulted in lower nacl rejections this could be related to the effect of solvent type on the phase inversion mechanism as mentioned in the previous section low solubility parameters disparity of polymer and solvent shows a low tendency for phase separation in nips bath and the resultant membrane would have sponge like morphology on the other side the high solubility parameter disparity of polymer and solvent shows a high tendency for phase separation in the nips bath and the final membrane would have a finger like morphology 45 in the current study the solubility parameter disparity of dmf pei and dx pei is 1 4 and 3 0 respectively therefore the higher ψ values higher dmf percent in the solvent mixture would result in a more sponge like morphology while lower ψ higher dx percent in the solvent mixture would result in a more finger like morphology it is clear that the faster phase inversion applies higher stress to the membrane surface during phase inversion in the nips bath the higher stress causes the formation of high porosity membranes with non uniform pores and lower skin on top layer while the lower stress causes the formation of the membranes with lower porosity with more uniform pores and thicker top layer skin through slower phase separation it could be clearly observed in figs 7 and 9 that by increasing the ratio of the solvents pwf decreased and salt rejection increased moreover the evaporation time and solvent ratio play important roles in the formation of membrane structure lower the ratio of the solvents ψ and higher evaporation time cause the increase of polymeric solution viscosity therefore by the increase of evaporation time and the ratio of the solvents more spongy structure with lower pwf but higher salt rejections are expected as shown in figs 7 and 9 also by the increase of the evaporation time the viscosity of the polymeric solution especially at the film top surface becomes so high that it increases the phase inversion time considerably and results in the low porosity membranes with nearly constant water flux and high salt rejection the water flux is less sensitive to top layer casting thickness and the ratio of the solvents but the salt rejection becomes more sensitive to the top layer casting thickness and the ratio of the solvents this shows the as the evaporation time increases the pwf is mainly controlled by the membrane porosity while the salt rejection is governed by the membrane pore size 46 the quadratic model with an r squared equal to 0 7927 was proposed by the software for mgso4 rejection the results of anova for mgso4 rejection are reported in table 6 the model f value of 4 25 proves that the model is significant the p value implies that there is only a 1 7 chance that a model f value this large could occur due to noise it can be seen that ψ θ ψ 2 θ2 are significant model terms since their p value is less than 0 05 while top layer thickness δ was not as significant as other parameters regarding mgso4 rejection in the selected range similar to nacl rejection the anova demonstrates that model terms θ and ψ which correspond to evaporation time and dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer respectively had the highest impact on the mgso4 rejection after neglecting insignificant parameters the proposed equation for mgso4 rejection is as follows 5 m g s o 4 r e j e c t i o n 490 08 91 63 ψ 7 61 θ 127 19 ψ 2 0 03 θ 2 the behavior of the membranes regarding mgso4 rejection had the same pattern as the nacl rejection nevertheless mgso4 rejection values were higher than nacl rejection since the bivalent hydrated ionic salt is bigger than the monovalent salt 3 3 3 porosity among various proposed models by the software for the porosity of the fabricated membranes a quadratic model with an r square of 0 7490 had the most agreement with the experimental data table 7 represents the analysis of variance for this model the f value equal to 3 32 implies that the model is significant this is while there is only a 3 78 chance that this f value could occur due to noise among different parameters it can be seen that top layer thickness δ had the most significant effect on porosity with an f value and a p value equal to 14 11 and 0 0037 respectively after neglecting insignificant parameters the proposed equation for porosity is as follows 6 p o r o s i t y 125 28 63 ψ 0 27 δ 12 4 ψ 2 once again the negative sign before the top layer thickness δ indicates that increasing the top layer thickness would result in smaller porosity values the reason will be explained in the following section fig 10 demonstrates the predicted data for porosity versus the actual experimental data a reasonable agreement between actual and predicted data can be observed from this figure fig 11 shows the interactive effects of dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer and top layer thickness on the porosity of membranes lower polymer concentration on one hand and higher dmf dx weight ratios in the sub layer on the other hand led to the formation of macro voids in this layer these macro voids contribute the most to the membrane porosity since total casting thickness for the membrane was set at 200 μm as top layer casting thickness increased sub layer casting thickness would decrease therefore as can be observed from fig 11 an increase in top layer casting thickness resulted in a decline in membrane porosity because the concentration of the casting solution for top layer is higher than the sub layer the morphology of the top layer should be more sponge like with smaller pores because of the higher delayed demixing phase inversion respect to the sub layer 45 on the other hand the phase inversion in the flat membranes is started from the top surface during the immersion in the nips bath the nucleation followed by solidification causes a migration of the polymer chains from the lower parts of the film to the surface that makes a higher density porous solid at the surface polymer rich and lower concentration polymer solution at the lower parts solvent rich the dilute solution forms a highly spongy morphology with large pores macropores during the solidification by the non solvent formation mechanism of the asymmetric integrated skin membranes 47 the apparent porosity that is commonly measured by immersing in low surface tension low viscosity and low volatility liquid typically isopropyl alcohol ipa could measure the porosity corresponding to the large pores larger than 50 nm then the reported porosities are mainly due to the porosity of the sub layer and lower part of the top layer as it could be observed in the sem images in fig 12 moreover it can be noted that decreasing the dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer would also result in lower porosity the reason as explained before is that lower weight ratios of dmf dx cause delayed demixing phase separation which in turn would lead to denser structures in the top layer thus it would decrease membrane porosity as for the interactive effect of dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer and top layer thickness it is evident that top layer thickness has a more severe effect on the membrane porosity in lower dmf dx weight ratios as expected top layer casting thickness can have a more significant effect in membrane porosity when it has a denser structure 3 3 4 optimization of the design parameters numerical optimization was performed on the models in order to determine the optimum values for the design parameters the optimization was performed for two cases in case 1 the goal was to maximize nacl rejection since it is a representative for the performance of a membrane in a separation process however higher salt rejection is usually a trade off for lower permeability therefore in case 2 the goal was set to maximize both nacl rejection and pwf simultaneously with the same level of importance table 8 represents both optimization cases and the resultant responses which were proposed by the software the desirability value can range from zero to one it shows the degree to which the proposed response is in accordance with the goal the desirability equal to 1 for case 1 shows that the proposed response is well in accordance with the goal which was maximizing nacl rejection in the studied range however since the goal for case 2 was to maximize both water flux and nacl rejection and because both of them cannot be met at the same time the maximum desirability in this case is not more than 0 536 as it was expected for case 1 the maximum value of nacl rejection could be achieved in higher evaporation time and top layer thickness a comparison of the fabrication conditions for the case 1 and case 2 reveals that besides the changes in the sub layer structure induced by the top layer in the two cases the top layer itself is responsible for this considerable difference in permeability and salt rejection in case 1 the ratio of the solvents i e ψ is 0 62 which shows more tendency for the formation of sponge like structure through delayed demixing phase separation in case 2 ψ is 0 4 which shows a lower tendency for the formation of a sponge like structure the sub layer condition for the two membranes is the same except the thickness the dmf dx ratio in the sub layer is 3 0 which shows a very low tendency for phase inversion then the sub layer would have a highly sponge like morphology the evaporation time for case 1 and case 2 is 140 and 120 s respectively this shows that the solvent content at the surface layer at the time of immersion in the nips bath for case 1 is much less than in case 2 in better words the viscosity of the top layer for case 1 would be higher than case 2 at the time of immersion in the nips water bath also the top layer casting thickness for case 1 40 μm is higher than that for case 2 20 μm therefore the phase inversion at the top layer for case 2 takes place with less delay than case 1 then the top layer thickness of the final membrane in case 2 is expected to be much lower than those in case 1 the sem images of the cross section of the case 1 and case 2 membranes clearly shows the mentioned differences between the structures of the two membranes overall the origin of deterioration of salt rejection and increase of water permeability of case 2 compared to case 1 is the lower thickness and higher porosity of the top layer in case 2 induced by the lower viscosity and lower thickness of the top layer confirmation experiments were carried out in order to verify the proposed condition at optimum conditions for each case the results of verification tests are shown in table 9 indicate good agreement between the predicted results and the experimental results for both cases as was expected in the case 1 scenario since all the effective parameters were in favor of salt rejection a high nacl rejection with low water flux was achieved however in case 2 as pure water flux comes into play effective parameters should alter in a way to meet the middle ground between water flux and nacl rejection fig 12 shows the sem cross section and top surface image of both cases fig 12a and b are different magnification images taken from the cross section of the membrane fabricated by case 1 parameters fig 12d and e show images with different magnification taken from the cross section of the membrane fabricated by case 2 parameters fig 12c and f depict the images taken from the top surface of the membrane fabricated by the fabrication parameters of case 1 and case 2 respectively it can be observed that a two layer membrane with a dense top layer and a porous sub layer has successfully formed in both cases the evaporation time before immersing the membranes into the coagulation bath resulted in partial evaporation of solvent from the top of the polymeric film which consequently formed a thin and dense layer over this polymeric wet film that induced greater resistance against solvent exchange in the coagulation bath therefore as a result of delayed demixing a sponge like structure has been formed in the sub layer rather than a finger like structure 48 moreover the lower concentration of polymer in the sub layer on one hand and a higher ratio of dmf dx on the other hand has led to the formation of a very porous structure with low hydraulic resistance however a higher polymer content and lower dmf dx ratio in the top layer resulted in the formation of a very dense and selective top layer fig 12a and b show the cross sectional sem image of two different membranes with top layer casting thickness of 40 μm and 20 μm respectively the sem images show that when the top layer casting thickness is selected as 40 μm case 1 the final membrane top layer thickness is about 5 9 μm while for the case 2 membranes which have a top layer casting thickness of 20 μm the final membrane top layer thickness is only 2 3 μm the lower top layer thickness would result in lower hydraulic resistance and therefore higher pwfs which could be observed from the permeation results of case 1 and case 2 membranes it is also clear that the thickness of the top layer in case 1 is more than case 2 which is due to higher casting thickness considered for the fabrication of the membrane in this case in addition to shorter evaporation time the greater flux in case 2 could be attributed to a thinner top layer which resulted in less hydraulic resistance rather than case 1 with a thicker top layer the dmf dx ratio in the top layer for case 1 was higher than case 2 which means that the rate of solvent exchange was faster for case 1 therefore shorter coarsening time in this case before vitrification could lead to smaller nodule size 49 and hence a smoother surface can be formed 4 conclusion a double blade casting technique was used as an efficient way to fabricate two layer integrated skin polyetherimide nanofiltration membranes since different polymeric solutions were used for each layer the polymer concentration was determined independently for each one the effect of the design parameters such as dmf dx weight ratio in the top layer top layer thickness and evaporation time was studied in detail using response surface methodology it has been shown that 19 wt of pei could be considered as the critical concentration in the top layer since there is a good linkage between polymeric chains in the solution while its viscosity has not dramatically increased although higher polymer content in the top layer solution could result in a denser and more selective top layer it could sweep the sub layer in the double blade casting method analysis of variance implied that the evaporation time had the most significant effect on the pure water flux and rejection characteristics of the two layer membranes moreover it was found that the top layer thickness was of great importance regarding membrane porosity two cases for optimization of the design parameters were examined and compared with the predicted data case 1 was designed to maximize nacl rejection the resultant membrane had a nacl rejection equal to 25 7 in case 2 the goal was to maximize both nacl rejection and pure water flux simultaneously in this case the resultant membrane had a pure water flux and nacl rejection equal to 1 47 l m2h bar and 13 6 respectively depending on the polymer type fabrication method additives post treatment etc very different water fluxes has been reported in literature in the range of 0 12 1 46 l m2 h bar 50 0 96 5 04 l m2 h bar 51 1 7 9 5 l m2 h bar 52 1 2 2 6 l m2 h bar 53 and 0 2 2 2 l m2 h bar 54 although the obtained water fluxes in the current study seem to be at the lower range of flux in nanofiltration membranes it should be noted that the presented method is a facile single step technique to fabricate asymmetric integrated skin nanofiltration membranes and with simple modifications in the studied parameters it could be used as a support layer for membrane fabrication using interfacial polymerization to gain both higher water flux and salt rejection overall it seems that the double blade casting technique provides more control over the membrane morphological structure and with the tuning of the design parameters a membrane with the desired characteristics could be formed nevertheless we believe that this study could be considered as a starting point for this method and certainly it needs to be developed by the other researches of the field of membrane fabrication declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing for financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

14109,coagulant addition and improved mixing conditions have been used in anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr to improve membrane performance before coagulant was added a flux of 8 l m2 h was applicable and transmembrane pressure tmp increased from 1 kpa to 10 kpa in 5 days however after the coagulant was added a flux as high as 50 l m2 h was achieved with no noticeable increase in tmp during six hours of operation furthermore at the same high flux a long term experiment showed that tmp increased to approximately 3 kpa in 20 days apparently the applied coagulant significantly improved membrane performance the reduction in the number of small particles was identified as the main cause for the high flux however the number of submicon particles increased in the long term experiment in addition a model was developed that adequately described the tmp development in the short term and long term experiments according to this model the deterioration in specific cake resistance resulted in a sharp tmp increase in the long term experiment in addition experiments showed that the effect of coagulant on sludge activity was minimal this study demonstrated that the applied coagulant and reactor operation conditions mixing properties have potentials of interest for improving the membrane flux in anmbr keywords anaerobic membrane coagulant bioreactor bouling 1 introduction anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs are reactors that combine anaerobic digestion and membrane filtration membranes allow high sludge concentrations in anmbrs regardless whether wastewater characteristics and or process conditions hamper biomass granulation which is generally the means to ensure high biomass concentrations in anaerobic bioreactors therefore anmbrs offer higher volumetric conversion capacities compared to other anaerobic reactors that suffer problems with proper sludge retention via granulation or biomass immobilisation thus far anmbrs have been successfully applied in the full scale treatment of various complex industrial wastewaters that often have led to operational problems in anaerobic sludge bed reactors 1 3 anmbrs are frequently limited by low permeate fluxes several authors reported fluxes 10 l m2 h 4 7 many efforts have been done to improve the flux of anmbrs such as dosing powdered activated carbon pac applying turbulence promoters and gas liquid two phase flow 6 8 15 the effect of dosing pac on membrane fouling in anmbr was found to be insignificant 7 this possibly can be attributed to the fact that pac gets covered by the biomass and thereby loses its capacity to adsorb foulants and to scour the membrane surface 7 alternatively application of glass beads can significantly reduce membrane fouling as the beads can shear the membrane surface and thereby preventing the formation of a dense or compact fouling layer however the application of glass beads may damage the membrane in long term operations 13 the effectiveness of membrane scouring by gas bubbles for fouling control strongly depends on the sludge filterability a high permeate flux can only be achieved if the sludge filterability is high 16 in addition applying ultrasound which is a known technology for removing foulants from a surface can improve membrane performance 17 however membrane dis integrity in long term experiments has been confirmed 18 this is because ultra sound produces cavitation that damages the membrane 19 both the operational conditions and the influent characteristics have a big impact on the attainable flux of anmbrs of which the latter can be attributed to the strength and nature or organic pollutants 20 24 literature shows that the fluxes in anmbrs are generally much lower than those obtained in aerobic mbrs 25 26 results from full scale reactors showed attainable fluxes of 15 20 l m2 h by applying cross flow velocities of 1 5 4 m s 27 which is at the expense of increased energy consumption coagulant dosing shows interesting perspectives for membrane fouling control although several authors reported a positive effect of coagulant dosing 28 30 research on coagulant application in anmbrs is limited it was found that dosing polyaluminum chloride was more effective than dosing granular activated carbon for membrane fouling control in an anmbr 31 thus far results show permeate fluxes between 10 and 20 l m2 h 32 33 which already indicates that similar permeate fluxes might be achieved in an anmbr compared to an aerobic mbr nonetheless the applicability of anmbr will drastically improve if fluxes over 30 l m2 h can be achieved 34 which requires a further technology advancement in order to achieve a high flux that enables economic reactor operation the impact of dosing coagulant was further researched in short term and long term experiments a bioreactor was equipped with an inside out tubular membrane and gas liquid slug flow a multi blade stirrer was applied in the bioreactor for providing suitable mixing conditions for flocculation as the rheology of anaerobic sludge is significantly different from that of clean water conventional knowledge on achieving a good flocculation in clean water might be not applicable in this study the rotation speed of the stirrer was optimized by using computational fluid dynamics to determine ideal mixing conditions sludge particle size distribution was measured before and after applying coagulant in addition a model was applied to investigate transmembrane pressure development in the short term and long term experiments furthermore the impact of dosing coagulant on sludge activity was tested 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation the inoculum sludge was taken from a full scale reactor treating saline wastewater from a styrene and propene oxide production plant shell moerdijk the netherlands the salinity of the inoculum sludge was 13 g na l a cylindrical glass vessel was used as the anaerobic bioreactor with an effective volume and inner diameter of 4 5 l and 10 cm respectively the temperature of the bioreactor was kept at 35 c via a water jacket surrounding the bioreactor the reactor feed consisted of a mixture of gelatin acetate propionate and butyrate to obtain a chemical oxygen demand cod ratio of 2 1 1 1 for the macro and micro nutrient composition reference is made to one of our previous reports 8 sorenson s phosphate buffer was applied for fixing the ph to 7 2 35 nacl was added to maintain the salinity in the reactor at 13 g na l details of the composition of the sythetic wastewater can refer to supplementary material the total suspended solids concentration tss in the anmbr was 40 g l the applied organic sludge loading rate was 0 3 g cod g tss d a multi blade stirrer was used for mixing the rotation speed of the stirrer was fixed at 30 rpm a tubular inside out cross flow polyvinylidene fluoride membrane norit the netherlands was used and operated in a gas lift mode length and diameter of the tubular membrane were 0 74 m and 5 2 mm respectively permeate flux was regulated by controlling a permeate pump watson marlow 323 d the produced biogas was injected into the bottom of the membrane via a gas pump watson marlow 323 d sludge was introduced into the membrane via gas motion the gas velocity and the liquid velocity in the tubular membrane were 0 74 m s and 0 34 m s respectively the trans membrane pressure tmp was recorded by a pressure sensor ae sensor 261920 labview was used to record the pressure signal from the pressure sensor the selected coagulant was aluminum hydroxyl chloride pluspac fd ach feralco this was done because fe ions would present in effluent and make the effluent colorful if an fe based coagulant was selected and an organic coagulant would be degraded by sludge coagulant addition was applied in a pulse dose regime in which the coagulant concentration in the reactor was increased in subsequent steps after each step the impact on tmp and membrane flux was assessed finally the highest coagulant concentration i e 0 96 g al l was applied in a long term experiment a schematic drawing of the setup is shown in fig 1 2 2 analysis and measurement particle size distribution psd was measured with a particle counter model 3000 pacific scientific instruments 2 400 μm percentage of each particle size was provided with the particle counter the number of submicron particles was measured with a hiac chemshield instrument pacific scientific instruments this instrument uses laser light scattering as a sensing method for small particle sizes 0 15 0 4 μm ion concentration on sludge particles surface was measured with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx philips xl30 tss concentration was measured following standard methods 36 2 3 sludge activity measurement specific methanogenic activity sma was measured with an automatic methane potential test system ampts bioprocess control sweden during the sma tests acetate initial concentration 2 2 g cod l was used as the substrate and sludge concentration was 4 0 g tss l in order to obtain a salinity equal to that of the reactor from which the inoculum was derived the salinity was adjusted to 13 g na l by the addition of nacl each sma test was performed in duplicate and an sma test of a blank sample was also performed the blank sample was equal to the samples of each sma test except for the acetate addition the total volume of the mixture of sludge and medium was 400 ml the medium was prepared according to one of our previous reports 8 2 4 tmp model the tmp in the anmbr was modelled using equations 1 6 whereas the definition of parameters and variables used in the equations 1 6 are shown in table 1 the eq 1 has been widely adopted for describing the relationship between transmembrane pressure and liquid dynamic viscosity as well as flux and total filtration resistance the total filtration resistance is the sum of membrane resistance and cake layer resistance eq 2 the cake layer resistance is determined by the specific cake layer resistance and accumulated cake mass eq 3 the eq 3 was extended by eq 4 considering that a cake layer is compressible 37 membrane filtration results in the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface while inertial lift forces remove foulants from the membrane surface to the bulk solution eq 5 shows how these two mechanisms influence the variation of foulant mass on the membrane surface 1 p r μ j r t 2 r t r m r c 3 r c r m 4 r r c 0 1 p r p 0 c o m 5 d m d t 24 c j 2 24 j c d d g β 1 α g m 2 γ j t 2 m 6 d i 1 n d i p i detailed explanation for parameters and variables is discussed in literature 37 38 the size of the suspended anaerobic sludge particles covered a wide range 6 however previous studies did not show how the particle diameter d was obtained in this study statistics was applied to obtain a particle diameter that was applied in the eq 5 then the mathematical expectation of all the measured particle diameter was applied as a particle diameter as shown in equation 6 the average shear rate on the membrane surface was obtained by performing a computational fluid dynamics cfd study for details regarding the cfd study we refer to our previous report 16 the model was implemented by using aquasim 2 0 transmembrane pressure pr was the sole model output when applying the equations 1 6 initial specific cake resistance and compressibility coefficient were estimated by aquasim 2 0 the compressibility coefficient alpha can vary from 0 non compressible to 1 highly compressible 37 in this study it was estimated to be 0 72 total suspended solid concentration was measured following standard method 36 other parameters were adopted from literature 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of particle diameter on the accumulated cake mass on the membrane surface when no coagulant was added tmp increased quickly fig 2 at a permeate flux of 8 l m2 h the tmp increased to approximately 12 kpa in seven days fig 2 shows that the model agreed well with the measured data which indicates that the model could be effectively applied to explain the tubular membrane filtration process after about 120 h in fig 2 the tmp increase was reliably predicted by equations 1 6 showing that these equations can be applied to analyze membrane filtration performance by setting dm dt in eq 5 to zero i e assuming steady state a relationship between particle diameter and mass of foulants was obtained fig 3 fig 3 shows that particles with diameters below 10 μ m most substantially contributed to foulant accumulation on the membrane surface other experiments also confirmed that particles with diameters of this size 10 μ m are the most important membrane foulants 39 it should be noted that the results shown in fig 3 cannot be extended to submicron particles because the foulant transport mechanisms adopted in equations 1 6 do not include electrostatic repulsion and brownian movement of the particles nevertheless fig 3 indicates that submicron particles are more likely to accumulate on the membrane surface than particles in the micron range which is in accordance with song and elimelech 40 furthermore numerous studies have confirmed that extracellular polymeric substances eps which are usually submicron particles are major membrane foulants 41 therefore techniques that can effectively remove particles with diameters smaller than 10 μ m from the bulk liquid are useful in preventing particles from accumulating on the surface of a tubular membrane and thereby alleviating membrane fouling when accumulated on membrane suface foulant could become more compact which explains why there are deviations between measured and modelled results 3 2 effect of dosing coagulant on the sludge particle diameter the presence of coagulants will destabilize the small sized suspended particles which subsequently will be attracted to each other through electrostatic interactions forming large flocs therefore aluminum hydroxyl chloride which is a coagulant was added to the reactor at a dose of 0 48 g al l after which flocculation occurred compared to sludge without coagulant addition the addition of coagulant resulted in a substantial decrease in the percentages of particles with a diameter below 6 μm fig 4 meanwhile the number of particles with diameters between 8 μm and 12 μm increased in addition a dose of 0 72 g al l further enhanced this effect the latter dose can be considered the optimum dosage since the application of a higher aluminum dosage 0 96 g al l resulted into a similar psd as the application of a lower dosage the effect of coagulant addition at these dosages on membrane performance were tested afterwards 3 3 short term effects of dosing coagulant on membrane fouling fig 5 a shows that a low dose of coagulant 0 48 g al l effectively restrained the increase in tmp when the flux was 15 l m2 h the tmp was maintained around zero kpa when a higher flux was applied 30 l m2 h only a small increasing trend was observed however eventually the tmp increased to 12 kpa within 70 h as shown in fig 5b therefore although aluminum hydroxyl chloride apparently improved the membrane performance it was not possible to achieve a very high flux with low or no tmp increase when a low coagulant dosage was applied therefore more coagulant was added to reach a dosage of up to 0 72 g al l the membrane filtration performance significantly improved after this dose fig 6 a shows that the tmp did not increase at all over several hours even when the flux was as high as 50 l m2 h compared to the frequently observed low filterability of anaerobic sludge 42 43 the aluminum hydroxyl chloride addition allowed a very high short term flux subsequently higher fluxes were applied at the same dose the tmp was measured as a function of time at various fluxes fig 6b when the fluxes were lower than 70 l m2 h the tmp increase rates were small but a slight increasing trend was observed a coagulant does of 0 96 al l was also tested however no further improvement in attainable permeate flux was found data not shown 3 4 long term effects of dosing coagulant on membrane fouling fig 6 shows that a high flux of 50 l m2 h appeared to be sustainable on the short term therefore an experiment was performed to investigate the tmp trend on the long term fig 7 shows that a low tmp was observed at the beginning of the long term experiment although it gradually increased afterward however the time for reaching a tmp approaching 10 kpa was greatly extended compared to the experiments when no coagulant was applied fig 2 other anmbr related studies obtained fluxes below 20 l m2 h by applying organic coagulants 28 32 33 44 our present study showed that dependent on process conditions and type of coagulant a much higher flux reaching 50 l m2 h can be achieved furthermore we believe that the designed hydraulic conditions in our reactor were favorable for flocculation of particles and hence contributed to the high flux a multi blade stirrer with a rotation speed of 30 rpm was applied in our reactor the shape and the size of the blades as well as the speed were designed for creating optimal conditions for flocculation in the reactor see supplementary material moreover the average contact time in the bioreactor was apparently enough for an effective coagulation process other studies regarding fouling control in an anmbr by using coagulants did not address the required hydraulic conditions our results clearly indicate that the applied gas liquid two phase flow is not the major factor in flux control fig 2 apparently an increase in sludge filterability is indispensable for flux enhancement 16 the gradual increase in tmp was attributed to a gradual increase in the number of submicron particles the submicron particles referred to as colloids are considered major membrane foulants 45 the addition of the coagulant significantly decreased the number of submicron particles from 2 5 105 to 1 7 105 particles per liter this very likely contributed to the observed increased filterability of the sludge as witnessed by a higher permeate flux during the short term experiments however after 30 days the submicron particle number almost increased to its initial value 2 3 105 per liter exerting a negative impact on cake permeability therefore an increase in the number of submicron particles should be avoided considering the strong relationship between sludge filterability and the number of submicron particles the increase in submicron particle number likely can be attributed to bacterial activity bacteria continuously produce submicron particles these biomass based submicron particles are not completely biodegradable 46 therefore their accumulation in membrane bioreactors is inevitable the applied model effectively matched the measured tmp trend table 1 and fig 7 show that the addition of coagulant reduced rco from 8 1 1011 m kg to 1 109 m kg see table 1 and fig 7 however when a constant rco was assumed the equations 1 6 could not predict the sharp increase in tmp after 20 days fig 7 nevertheless the increase in the number of submicron particles indicated that rco should vary the model estimated that a linear increase in rco after day 20 resulted in a sharp increase in the tmp and the simulated tmp nicely matched the measured tmp fig 7 a few parameters in the model are adopted from literature although the coagulant might have impacts on these parameter values the impact is likely to be minimal as the variation in rco could well model the variation in tmp showing rco is an important factor affecting tmp increase 3 5 effects of dosing coagulant on sludge activity we focused on the effects of dosing coagulant on improving membrane performance while the effects on reactor long term performance such as cod removal was ignored nevertheless an sma test was applied to evaluate whether the coagulant had a negative impact on sludge activity when no coagulant was added the sludge activity was 0 40 0 03 g cod ch4 g tss d the addition of the coagulant only slightly decreased the sludge activity to 0 37 0 03 g cod ch4 g tss d at 0 96 g al l the small decrease in sma could result from the accumulation of al3 on the sludge particle surface table 2 which might restrict the substrate mass transfer in the sma test our study showed that the cod was completely removed at the applied organic load 7 although a slight and non significant sma reduction was observed by applying the coagulant the added coagulant had only a minimal impact on reactor performance which is in accordance with other studies 32 47 apparently the impact of metal based coagulants on sma differs from organic flocculants that lead to a drop in sma in previous research our lab 28 48 we reported that the filterability of saline sludge is worse than conventional sludge working under non harsh conditions 8 nevertheless this study showed that the flux of an anmbr could be increased to 50 l m2 h indicating that even a higher flux could be achieved compared to non saline conditions an increase in the number of submicron particles hampered the long term high flux performance therefore a periodic or intermittent coagulant dosage is likely required for stable anmbr operation at a high flux and low tmp such periodic coagulant dosage requires an advanced control strategy that aims at an effective membrane fouling mitigation approach as well as at preventing an undesired coagulant accumulation in anmbrs meanwhile the accumulating ineffective coagulant can be removed from the bioreactor by sludge discharge therefore a long term experiment 1 year should be conducted to optimize intermittent coagulant addition and ineffective coagulant removal for ensuring sustainable membrane performance moreover except for the advanced control strategy the impacts of sludge discharge type of coagulant on membrane performance operation cost reactor s activity as well as microbial structure will be evaluated in the long term experiment it should be noted that our present anmbr experiments were conducted applying tss concentrations of about 40 g l resulting in non newtonian fluid behavior which hampers a direct comparison with most experiments that apply different newtonian hydrodynamic conditions nonetheless results clearly showed an improved membrane performance after reducing the number of submicron particles in addition fig 3 suggests that the membrane performance is impacted by a shift in psd between 2 10 μm which is in accordance to recent research 49 4 conclusion although the impacts of coagulant addition on fouling control in anaerobic membrane bioreactors have been tested membrane flux is usually below 20 l m2 h this study achieved a significant membrane fouling control effect tmp was maintained below 3 kpa in 20 days while a high membrane flux at 50 l m2 h was applied this flux was much higher than the achievement shown in literature moreover the tmp variation in long term membrane operation can be reasonably modelled the deterioration in specific cake resistance was estimated to be the main reason for the tmp jump furthermore the impact of coagulant on sludge activity was negligible finally it is suggested that adding coagulant in anaerobic membrane bioreactor is a promising approach for alleviate membrane fouling and suitable mixing should be applied for promoting the coagulation effect declaration of competing

dosing shows interesting perspectives for membrane fouling control although several authors reported a positive effect of coagulant dosing 28 30 research on coagulant application in anmbrs is limited it was found that dosing polyaluminum chloride was more effective than dosing granular activated carbon for membrane fouling control in an anmbr 31 thus far results show permeate fluxes between 10 and 20 l m2 h 32 33 which already indicates that similar permeate fluxes might be achieved in an anmbr compared to an aerobic mbr nonetheless the applicability of anmbr will drastically improve if fluxes over 30 l m2 h can be achieved 34 which requires a further technology advancement in order to achieve a high flux that enables economic reactor operation the impact of dosing coagulant was further

the impact of dosing coagulant on sludge activity was tested 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation the inoculum sludge was taken from a full scale reactor treating saline wastewater from a

respectively the trans membrane pressure tmp was recorded by a pressure sensor ae sensor 261920 labview was used to record the pressure signal from the pressure sensor the selected coagulant was aluminum hydroxyl chloride pluspac fd ach feralco this was done because fe ions would present in effluent and make the effluent colorful if an fe based coagulant was selected and an organic coagulant would be degraded by sludge coagulant addition was applied in a pulse dose regime in which the coagulant concentration in the reactor was increased in subsequent steps after each step the impact on tmp and membrane flux was assessed finally the highest coagulant concentration i e 0 96 g al l was applied in a long term experiment a schematic drawing of the setup is shown in fig 1 2 2 analysis and

initial concentration 2 2 g cod l was used as the substrate and sludge concentration was 4 0 g tss l in order to obtain a salinity equal to that of the reactor from which the inoculum was derived the salinity was adjusted to 13 g na l by the addition of nacl each sma test was performed in duplicate and an sma test of a blank sample was also performed the blank sample was equal to the samples of each sma test except for the acetate addition the total volume of the mixture of sludge and medium was 400 ml the medium was prepared according to one of our previous reports 8 2 4 tmp model the tmp in the anmbr was modelled using equations 1 6 whereas the definition of parameters and variables used in the equations 1 6 are shown in table 1 the eq 1 has been widely adopted for describing the relationship between transmembrane pressure and liquid dynamic viscosity as well as flux and total filtration resistance the total filtration resistance is the sum of membrane resistance and cake layer resistance eq 2 the cake layer resistance is determined by the specific cake layer resistance and accumulated cake mass eq 3 the eq 3 was extended by eq 4 considering that a cake layer is compressible 37 membrane filtration results in the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface while inertial lift forces remove foulants from the membrane surface to the bulk solution eq 5 shows how these two mechanisms influence the variation of foulant mass on the membrane surface 1 p r μ j r t 2 r t r m r c 3 r c r m 4 r r c 0 1 p r p 0 c o m 5 d m d t 24 c j 2 24 j c d d g β 1 α g m 2 γ j

studies did not show how the particle diameter d was obtained in this study statistics was applied to obtain a particle diameter that was applied in the eq 5 then the mathematical expectation of all the measured particle diameter was applied as a particle diameter as shown in equation 6 the average shear rate on the membrane surface was obtained by performing a computational fluid dynamics cfd study for details regarding the cfd study we refer to our previous report 16 the model was implemented by using aquasim 2 0 transmembrane pressure pr was the sole model output when applying the equations 1 6 initial specific cake resistance and compressibility coefficient were estimated by aquasim 2 0 the compressibility coefficient alpha can vary from 0 non compressible to 1 highly compressible 37 in this study it was estimated to be 0 72 total suspended solid concentration was measured following standard method 36 other parameters were adopted from literature 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of particle diameter on the accumulated cake mass on the membrane surface when no coagulant was added tmp increased quickly fig 2 at a permeate flux of 8 l m2 h the tmp increased to approximately 12 kpa in seven days fig 2 shows that the model agreed well with the measured data which indicates that the model could be effectively applied to explain the tubular membrane filtration process after about 120 h in fig 2 the tmp increase was reliably predicted by equations 1 6 showing that these equations can be applied to analyze membrane filtration performance by setting dm dt in eq 5 to zero i e assuming steady state a relationship between particle diameter and mass of foulants was obtained fig 3 fig 3 shows that particles with diameters below 10 μ m most substantially contributed to foulant accumulation on the membrane surface other experiments also confirmed that particles with diameters of this size 10 μ m are the most important membrane foulants 39 it should be noted that the results shown in fig 3 cannot be extended to submicron particles because the foulant transport mechanisms adopted in equations 1 6 do not include electrostatic repulsion and brownian movement of the particles nevertheless fig 3 indicates that submicron particles are more likely to accumulate on the membrane surface than particles in the micron range which is in accordance with song and elimelech 40 furthermore numerous studies have confirmed that extracellular polymeric substances eps which are usually submicron particles are major membrane foulants 41 therefore techniques that can effectively remove particles with diameters smaller than 10 μ m from the bulk liquid are useful in preventing particles from accumulating on the surface of a tubular membrane and thereby alleviating membrane fouling when accumulated on membrane suface foulant could become more compact which explains why there are deviations between measured and modelled results 3 2 effect of dosing coagulant on the sludge particle diameter the presence of coagulants will destabilize the small sized suspended particles which subsequently will be attracted to each other through electrostatic interactions forming large flocs therefore aluminum hydroxyl chloride which is a coagulant was added to the reactor at a dose of 0 48 g al l after which flocculation occurred compared to sludge without coagulant addition the addition of coagulant resulted in a substantial decrease in the percentages of particles with a diameter below 6 μm fig 4 meanwhile the number of particles with diameters between 8 μm and 12 μm increased in addition a dose of 0 72 g al l further enhanced this effect the latter dose can be considered the optimum dosage since the application of a higher aluminum dosage 0 96 g al l resulted into a similar psd as the application of a lower dosage the effect of coagulant addition at these dosages on membrane performance were tested afterwards 3 3 short term effects of dosing coagulant on membrane fouling fig 5 a shows that a low dose of coagulant 0 48 g al l effectively restrained the increase in tmp when the flux was 15 l m2 h the tmp was maintained around zero kpa when a higher flux was applied 30 l m2 h only a small increasing trend was observed however eventually the tmp increased to 12 kpa within 70 h as shown in fig 5b therefore although aluminum hydroxyl chloride apparently improved the membrane performance it was not possible to achieve a very high flux with low or no tmp increase when a low coagulant dosage was applied therefore more coagulant was added to reach a dosage of up to 0 72 g al l the membrane filtration performance significantly improved after this dose fig 6 a shows that the tmp did not increase at all over several hours even when the flux was as high as 50 l m2 h compared to the frequently observed low filterability of anaerobic sludge 42 43 the aluminum hydroxyl chloride addition allowed a very high short term flux subsequently higher fluxes were applied at the same dose the tmp was measured as a function of time at various fluxes fig 6b when the fluxes were lower than 70 l m2 h the tmp increase rates were small but a slight increasing trend was observed a coagulant does of 0 96 al l was also tested however no further improvement in attainable permeate flux was found data not shown 3 4 long term effects of dosing coagulant on membrane fouling fig 6 shows that a high flux of 50 l m2 h appeared to be sustainable on the short term therefore an experiment was performed to investigate the tmp trend on the long term fig 7 shows that a low tmp was observed at the beginning of the long term experiment although it gradually increased afterward however the time for reaching a tmp approaching 10 kpa was greatly extended compared to the experiments when no coagulant was applied fig 2 other anmbr related studies obtained fluxes below 20 l m2 h by applying organic coagulants 28 32 33 44 our present study showed that dependent on process conditions and type of coagulant a much higher flux reaching 50 l m2 h can be achieved furthermore we believe that the designed hydraulic conditions in our reactor were favorable for flocculation of particles and hence contributed to the high flux a multi blade stirrer with a rotation speed of 30 rpm was applied in our reactor the shape and the size of the blades as well as the speed were designed for creating optimal conditions for flocculation in the reactor see supplementary material moreover the average contact time in the bioreactor was apparently enough for an effective coagulation process other studies regarding fouling control in an anmbr by using coagulants did not address the required hydraulic conditions our results clearly indicate that the applied gas liquid two phase flow is not the major factor in flux control fig 2 apparently an increase in sludge filterability is indispensable for flux enhancement 16 the gradual increase in tmp was attributed to a gradual increase in the number of submicron particles the submicron particles referred to as colloids are considered major membrane foulants 45 the addition of the coagulant significantly decreased the number of submicron particles from 2 5 105 to 1 7 105 particles per liter this very likely contributed to the observed increased filterability of the sludge as witnessed by a higher permeate flux during the short term experiments however after 30 days the submicron particle number almost increased to its initial value 2 3 105 per liter exerting a negative impact on cake permeability therefore an increase in the number of submicron particles should be avoided considering the strong relationship between sludge filterability and the number of submicron particles the increase in submicron particle number likely can be attributed to bacterial activity bacteria continuously produce submicron particles these biomass based submicron particles are not completely biodegradable 46 therefore their accumulation in membrane bioreactors is inevitable the applied model effectively matched the measured tmp trend table 1 and fig 7 show that the addition of coagulant reduced rco from 8 1 1011 m kg to 1 109 m kg see table 1 and fig 7 however when a constant rco was assumed the equations 1 6 could not predict the sharp increase in tmp after 20 days fig 7 nevertheless the increase in the number of submicron particles indicated that rco should vary the model estimated that a linear increase in rco after day 20 resulted in a sharp increase in the tmp and the simulated tmp nicely matched the measured tmp fig 7 a few parameters in the model are adopted from literature although the coagulant might have impacts on these parameter values the impact is likely to be minimal as the variation in rco could well model the variation in tmp showing rco is an important factor affecting tmp increase 3 5 effects of dosing coagulant on sludge activity we focused on the effects of dosing coagulant on improving membrane performance while the effects on reactor long term performance such as cod removal was ignored nevertheless an sma test was applied to evaluate whether the coagulant had a negative impact on sludge activity when no coagulant was added the sludge activity was 0 40 0 03 g cod ch4 g tss d the addition of the coagulant only slightly decreased the sludge activity to 0 37 0 03 g cod ch4 g tss d at 0 96 g al l the small decrease in sma could result from the accumulation of al3 on the sludge particle surface table 2 which might restrict the substrate mass transfer in the sma test our study showed that the cod was completely removed at the applied organic load 7 although a slight and non significant sma reduction was observed by applying the coagulant the added coagulant had only a minimal impact on reactor performance which is in accordance with other studies 32 47 apparently the impact of metal based coagulants on sma differs from organic flocculants that lead to a drop in sma in previous research our lab 28 48 we reported that the filterability of saline sludge is worse than conventional sludge working under non harsh conditions 8 nevertheless this study showed that the flux of an anmbr could be increased to 50 l m2 h indicating that even a higher flux could be achieved compared to non saline conditions an increase in the number of submicron particles hampered the long term high flux performance therefore a periodic or intermittent coagulant dosage is likely required for stable anmbr operation at a high flux and low tmp such periodic coagulant dosage requires an advanced control strategy that aims at an effective membrane fouling mitigation approach as well as at preventing an undesired coagulant accumulation in anmbrs meanwhile the accumulating ineffective coagulant can be removed from the bioreactor by sludge discharge therefore a long term experiment 1 year should be conducted to optimize intermittent coagulant addition and ineffective coagulant removal for ensuring sustainable membrane performance moreover except for the advanced control strategy the impacts of sludge discharge type of coagulant on membrane performance operation cost reactor s activity as well as microbial structure will be evaluated in the long term experiment it should be noted that our present anmbr experiments were conducted applying tss concentrations of about 40 g l resulting in non newtonian fluid behavior which hampers a direct comparison with most experiments that apply different newtonian hydrodynamic conditions nonetheless results clearly showed an improved membrane performance after reducing the number of submicron particles in addition fig 3 suggests that the membrane performance is impacted by a shift in psd between 2 10 μm which is in accordance to recent research 49 4 conclusion although the impacts of coagulant addition on fouling control in anaerobic membrane bioreactors have been tested membrane flux is usually below 20 l m2 h this study achieved a significant membrane fouling control effect tmp was maintained below 3 kpa in 20 days while a high membrane flux at 50 l m2 h was applied this flux was much higher than the achievement shown in literature moreover the tmp variation in long term membrane operation can be reasonably modelled the deterioration in specific cake resistance was estimated to be the main reason for the tmp jump furthermore the impact of coagulant on sludge activity was negligible finally it is suggested that adding coagulant in anaerobic membrane bioreactor is a promising approach for alleviate membrane fouling and suitable mixing should be applied for promoting the coagulation effect declaration of competing
