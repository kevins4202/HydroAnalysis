18045,modeling studies have focused on n2o emissions in temperate rivers under static atmospheric n2o n2oairc with cold temperate river networks under dynamic n2oairc receiving less attention to address this knowledge and methodological gap the dissolved n2o concentration n2odisc and n2oairc algorithms were integrated with an air water gas exchange model fn2o into the swat soil and water assessment tool this new model swat fn2o allows users to simulate daily riverine n2o emissions under dynamic atmospheric n2o the spatiotemporal fluctuations in the riverine n2o emissions was simulated and its response to the static and dynamic atmospheric n2o were analyzed in a middle high latitude agricultural watershed in northeastern china the results show that the swat fn2o model is a useful method for capturing the hotspots in riverine n2o emissions the model showed strong riverine n2o absorption and weak n2o emissions from september to february which acted as a sink for atmospheric n2o in this cold temperate area high n2o emissions occurred from april to july which accounted for 83 34 of the yearly emissions spatial analysis indicated that the main stream and its tributary could contribute 302 3 1043 7 and 41 5 163 4 μg n2o m2 d to the total riverine n2o emissions 15 02 t a respectively the riverine n2o emissions rates in the subbasins dominated by forests and paddy fields were lower than those in the subbasins dominated by arable and residential land riverine n2o emissions can be overestimated under the static atmospheric n2o rather than under the increasing atmospheric n2o this overestimation has increased from 1 52 to 23 97 from 1990 to 2016 under the static atmospheric n2o the results of this study are valuable for water quality and future climate

greenhouse gas in river networks de klein et al 2006 marzadri et al 2017 fu et al 2018 the identification fate and spatiotemporal assessments of riverine n2o emissions at the watershed scale are important for achieving water safety and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in river networks wang et al 2015 2017 most studies focusing on assessments of riverine n2o emissions at the watershed scale have been conducted by directly measuring riverine n2o emissions using chambers hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 turner et al 2015 or air water gas exchange models baulch et al 2011 yan et al 2012 marzadri et al 2014 gardner et al 2016 soued et al 2016 however continuous site monitoring and experiments are not feasible for assessing the spatiotemporal changes in riverine n2o emissions at the watershed scale because they require extensive labor and financial and material resources wang et al 2015 marzadri et al 2017 hence modeling is often the preferred approach for conducting watershed scale assessments bach et al 2010 ouyang et al 2017a 2017b keupers and willems 2017 watershed scale models are powerful for identifying the spatiotemporal changes in riverine n2o emissions fu et al 2018 and the relationship between the diffuse nitrogen loss and riverine n2o emissions to the atmosphere swat soil and water assessment tool is a semi distributed model designed to simulate the hydrological nutrient and carbon cycles in soil and rivers at the watershed scale arnold et al 1998 ouyang et al 2013 ouyang et al 2017a however the official version of swat has no function for modeling riverine n2o emissions the flexibility of swat has been confirmed in integrated model studies yang et al 2017 wagena et al 2017 wu et al 2019 gao et al 2019 the recently developed swat ghg wagena et al 2017 swat n2o yang et al 2017 shrestha et al 2018 shrestha and wang 2018 swat mkt bhanja et al 2019a 2019b and swat n2o coupler gao et al 2019 models can simulate changes in soil properties and hydrologic and crop management factors to estimate soil n2o emissions however these models focus on soil n2o emissions rather than riverine n2o emissions at the watershed scale beaulieu et al 2011 modified a global river network n removal model which combined an air water gas exchange model a transfer efficiency model for dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and din loading model to estimate global n2o production in river systems however this din loading model is an empirical based model that cannot represent the hydrological and nutrient processes in the terrestrial surface system at the watershed scale beaulieu et al 2011 hu et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 developed a process based watershed scale riverine n2o model but this model did not consider the impacts of diffuse nitrogen loss from the terrestrial surface to the river a recent study showed that an empirical based riverine dissolved n2o concentration model and the air water gas exchange model cloud be integrated into the swat to simulate riverine n2o emissions in which atmospheric n2o concentrations are assumed to be a constant value fu et al 2018 there was no submodel for simulating dynamic atmospheric n2o concentrations in the study turner et al 2016 fu et al 2018 which is a key parameter for calculating the equilibrium n2o concentration weiss and price 1980 turner et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 according to the data from the noaa esrl global monitoring division there is a difference in atmospheric n2o concentrations in different month and a significant increasing trend 308 19 in 1990 to 329 58 ppb in 2016 of atmospheric n2o concentrations occurred hall et al 2007 constant atmospheric n2o concentrations could result in higher estimates of riverine denitrification and n2o emission rates and unreasonable spatiotemporal fluctuations in riverine n2o emissions böhlke et al 2009 additionally the riverine dissolved n2o concentration modeling in previous study turner et al 2016 fu et al 2018 is using the michaelis menten kinetics function which only include the riverine no 3 concentration variable to predict the dissolved n2o concentration this function cannot reflect the impact of nh 4 concentration on dissolved n2o concentration also cannot present correctly the high dissolved n2o concentration modeling under the high nitrogen level in rivers section 2 2 2 the drawbacks of this model prevent it from comprehensively reflecting the effects of atmospheric n2o concentration variation on riverine n2o emissions thus there is an urgent need to resolve these inadequacies to better simulate riverine n2o emissions at a watershed scale new riverine dissolved n2o concentration and atmospheric n2o concentration algorithms should be developed and integrated with an air water gas exchange model in the swat model to build a complementary watershed scale riverine n2o emissions model to fulfill the objectives of this study the swat n2o coupler was employed as the framework gao et al 2019 then riverine dissolved n2o concentration models for low and high nitrogen levels were developed and atmospheric n2o concentration model were developed and integrated with the air water gas exchange model fn2o into the swat n2o coupler model to build a complementary watershed scale riverine n2o emissions model swat fn2o which combined terrestrial and riverine processes that considered the dynamic atmospheric n2o concentrations the swat fn2o model was demonstrated for simulating riverine n2o emissions in middle high latitude agricultural watersheds in northeastern china specifically 1 the detailed parameters and information for model calibration and validation can be found in section 2 3 2 table s1 and fig s3 and the model s performance is evaluated in section 3 1 2 the riverine theoretical equilibrium n2o concentration and n2o emissions variations under static and dynamic atmospheric n2o are analyzed in section 3 2 3 the riverine n2o emissions are spatiotemporally evaluated in section 3 3 4 the reasonability of the magnitude and seasonal patterns of the modeled riverine n2o emissions in an agricultural watershed under cold temperature conditions are discussed 5 the controls of riverine nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions in rivers and the importance of dynamic n2o for estimating the long term riverine n2o variations were discussed in section 4 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the naoli river watershed of the sangjiang plain is located in a middle high latitude agricultural area of northeastern china fig 1 it has a total drainage area of

the specific description and calculation of each pathway can be found in previous studies arnold et al 1998 the swat first calculates the no 3 and nh 4 concentration in mobile water then the amount of no 3 and nh 4 that move with the water are obtained by multiplying the discharge of surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow and corresponding nitrate concentration neitsch et al 2011 fu et al

the geometry of river hydraulics yang et al 2017 wagena et al 2017 fu et al 2018 gao et al 2019 these parameters are required to model watershed scale riverine n2o emissions fu et al 2018 the swat n2o coupler model was developed in our previous study by integrating a modified hydrological model for paddy fields and soil n2o models into the swat s existing crop growth hydrology and nitrogen cycling algorithms effectively gao et al 2019 on the basis of the previous study one module and relevant submodules were added into the swat n2o coupler to develop the new model swat fn2o for simulating riverine n2o emissions in this study 1 a dissolved n2o concentration n2odisc model was developed based on a function of the riverine no 3 and nh 4 by using 638 individual measurements which were obtained from different study areas based on the published literature yan et al 2012 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 lin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 cooper et al 2017 2 an atmospheric n2o concentration n2oairc model was developed based on the combined n2o data from the noaa esrl global monitoring division and 3 an air water gas exchange model fn2o was employed to simulate riverine n2o emissions yan

638 individual measurements this dataset has been collected from different geographic areas including 522 observations in europe 24 observations in north america 62 observations in asia yan et al 2012 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 lin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 cooper et al 2017 according to the results reported by turner et al 2016 fu et al 2018 and the 638 individual measurements n2odisc model under different riverine nitrogen levels were developed the coefficient of determination r2 value of the din and dissolved n2o was 0 78 din 7 5 mg l and 0 61 din 7 5 mg l eq 2 fig 2 the n2odisc model

operation the swat n2o coupler model was developed in our previous study by integrating a modified hydrological model for paddy fields and soil n2o models into the swat s existing crop growth hydrology and nitrogen cycling algorithms xie and cui 2011 gao et al 2019 swat n2o coupler works at hrus while fn2o model dose at reaches the air water gas exchange model fn2o and its submodules have been added in the water quality module watqual f of the original swat model that performs in stream different nutrient transformations and water quality calculations has been improved to simulate riverine n2o for each reach source code can be found in supplementary file the improved model can present the impact of daily riverine n2o emissions on nitrate ammonium in the river specifically 1 the swat n2o coupler model simulates and outputs daily soil n2o emission and offers a variable storage method to route the daily nitrogen loading and streamflow generated as a result of nitrogen concentration and runoff coming from each of the hrus of the sub basins neitsch et al 2011 shrestha and wang 2018 fu et al 2018 which consider the impacts of real time hydrological process in paddy fields 2 algorithms for calculating riverine n2o have been added in water quality module watqual f written by fortran which is one of the subroutines of swat model the daily riverine nitrogen concentration loading streamflow and other hydrologic parameters e g velocity water depth temperature are used to drive the air water gas exchange model fn2o that includes n2odisc model n2oairc model n2oeqc model and n2o transfer velocity model to simulate riverine n2o emissions for each reach the rate constants for nitrate and ammonium to dissolved n2o were used to calculate the proportion of nitrate or ammonium to dissolved n2o this rate constant can be obtained by calibration the new model can simulate and output daily n2o emissions rates and loads additionally users can quickly conduct and display spatiotemporal analysis the operational structure of the swat fn2o model is presented in fig 3 2 3 demonstration of swat fn2o model 2 3 1 swat fn2o model initialization the developed swat fn2o model was initialized for the naoli river watershed in this study the land use in 2014 was interpreted based on landsat 8 images using supervised classification and the images were manually rectified during the field investigation ouyang et al 2018a gao et al 2019 rice and soybean are the major crops in paddy fields and drylands the management operations of the paddy fields and drylands were described in our previous study gao et al 2017 a digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 30 m was used for watershed discretization and was downloaded from the chinese geospatial data cloud website http www gscloud cn the soil spatial factors and property databases 1 1 000 000 were obtained from the national database developed by the institute of soil science chinese academy of science ouyang et al 2017a the watershed discretization produced 45 sub basins with 2742 hrus hydrologic response units weather data from 1987 to 2016 which were used to force the model were obtained from collection version 2 of the chinese daily surface weather database http data cma cn 2 3 2 swat fn2o model calibration and validation after the sensitivity analysis with the swat cup the monthly streamflow data which covered a period of six years and were obtained from the three hydrology monitoring stations fig 1 were first calibrated and validated for the naoli river watershed sixteen

good correlations between the observed and simulated soil water content r2 0 79 nse 0 74 and temperature r2 0 95 nse 0 89 in the watershed were achieved during validation gao et al 2019 four parameters for nitrogen concentration in rivers bc1 swq 0 22 bc2 swq 2 0 bc3 swq 0 23 and ai1 wwq 0 02 which are from the swat case study of hamatong in the naoli river watershed fig 1 table s1 were applied to validate the swat fn2o model results in this study zhu et al 2012 due to the case study locates in the middle high latitude area the water in the winter period was frozen and the samples cannot be taken it is difficult to collect and measure long term riverine nitrogen concentration it is an alternative way to use the limited observation from different reaches to validate the simulated riverine nitrogen ouyang et al 2017a in this study the 18 reaches for no 3 and nh 4 concentrations in surface water 0 5 m which were sampled and measured in september 2016 were used to validate the riverine nitrogen concentration simulated by the swat fn2o model fig 4 c the final step was the validation of the riverine n2o to evaluate the performance of the established n2odisc model 538 observed data points from the established database were used to train the n2odisc model and 100 observed data points were used to test the model fig 4a and b due to the lack of a long term observed riverine n2o the 18 reaches for riverine n2o in the naoli river watershed were used to validate the riverine n2o simulated by the swat fn2o model fig 4d 2 3 3 modeling of riverine n2o under the static and dynamic atmospheric n2o the developed spatiotemporal analysis module can present the daily monthly quarterly yearly and annual mean daily n2o emissions for specific reaches the validated swat fn2o model was used to dynamically simulate riverine n2o emissions during 1990 2016 the riverine theoretical equilibrium n2o concentration and n2o emissions variations under the static and dynamic atmospheric n2o were analyzed spatial and seasonal patterns of riverine n2o emissions were examined and discussed in section 3 3 and section 4 1 furthermore the controls of riverine nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions in rivers and the importance of dynamic n2o for estimating the long term riverine n2o variations were discussed in section 4 2 3 results 3 1 model performance evaluation acceptable performance of the n2odisc model was achieved during the training r2 0 74 nse 0 65 and testing stages r2 0 89 nse 0 73 fig 4a and b a satisfactory correlation between the monitored and simulated streamflow was achieved for the three hydrologic stations during both the calibration nse 0 65 r2 0 74 and validation nse 0 65 r2 0 70 periods fig s3 the swat fn2o model achieved acceptable performance for the riverine din concentration r2 0 81 nse 0 55 fig 4c and n2o emissions rates r2 0 79 nse 0 65 fig 4d during validation for this watershed indicating that the developed model can capture the magnitude and spatial patterns of riverine din concentrations and n2o emissions rates for different reaches therefore the swat fn2o model could explain 74 89 of the variability in the dissolved riverine n2o concentration and approximately 81 and 87 of the variability in the riverine din concentration and n2o emission rates respectively while the swat outputs the correct riverine environmental parameters 3 2 riverine n2o variation under the static and dynamic atmospheric n2o the swat fn2o allows variations of riverine dissolved n2o concentration n2odisc equilibrium n2o concentration n2oeqc and n2o emission rates fn2o under the static and dynamic atmospheric n2o to be elucidated at a yearly mean daily scale the modeling results showed that riverine n2o emissions rates under the static and dynamic atmospheric n2o present the similar variations trend ranging from 231 88 to 432 51 μg n2o m2 d over the past few decades which were mainly controlled by the dissolved n2o concentration however the riverine n2o emissions rates have been overestimated under static atmospheric n2o rather than under increasing atmospheric n2o increased from 308 19 in 1990 to 329 58 ppb in 2016 fig s2 this overestimation has been increased from 1 52 to 23 97 under static atmospheric n2o from 1990 to 2016 fig 5 a during the past few decades the fugacity of riverine n2o presented a decreasing trend due to the increasing water temperature in the river fig 5b weiss and price 1980 the decreased fugacity of riverine n2o resulted in a decreasing trend in the equilibrium n2o concentration in the river under static atmospheric n2o which is different from the increasing trend of the equilibrium n2o concentration under increasing atmospheric n2o fig 5c this scenario is the reason that the riverine n2o emissions rates can be overestimated under the static atmospheric n2o rather than under the increasing atmospheric n2o 3 3 spatiotemporal pattern in riverine n2o emissions fluxes obvious temporal differences were observed in the riverine n2o emission fluxes dissolved n2o concentrations and theoretical equilibrium n2o concentrations at a monthly scale fig 6 these variations were controlled by the variations in the nitrogen levels on the land surface and in the river induced by management practices including the timing of tillage fertilization and harvest and temporal climatic variations such as freezing thawing and precipitating in this middle high latitude agricultural watershed fu et al 2018 gao et al 2019 the riverine n2o emissions exhibited considerable monthly variation across the river watershed with emissions rates ranging from 568 to 1078 μg n m2 d and a mean emission rate of 253 μg n m2 d this result is similar to the results 200 to 1150 μg n m2 d reported by harley et al 2015 the monthly n2o emissions were impacted by the seasonal cycles of temperature transfer velocities dissolved n2o concentrations and theoretical equilibrium n2o concentrations fig 6 the n2o emission rates increased rapidly from march to april which coincided with the sudden increases in the dissolved n2o concentrations and gas transfer velocities which were induced by the freeze thaw and precipitation events fig 6 fu et al 2018 due to the snow melting induced by increasing temperature 0 c in april the n2o emission rates increased by 270 compared with the march fig 6a in comparison to other months in april to july higher n2o emissions occurred under the higher dissolved n2o concentration and lower equilibrium n2o concentration fig 6c and d this period was the main period acting as a source of atmospheric n2o throughout the year which accounted for 83 34 of the yearly emissions the lower dissolved n2o concentration and transfer velocities and higher equilibrium n2o concentration occurred from september to march which resulted in the lower n2o emission rates and this period acted as a sink for atmospheric n2o fig 6b and d the spatial variations in the riverine n2o were identified by the large scale environmental changes occurring in the watershed which included the dissolved n2o concentrations the dominant land use types and diffuse nitrogen loads from the land s surface in the subbasins fig 7 a spatially different land use cover presented the different n2o emissions rates upland paddy field river fig 7b the n2o emission load from agricultural system 12198 47 t yr is much larger than n2o emission load from river networks 15 02 t yr mainly due to the higher portion of agricultural land area table 1 riverine n2o emissions were found to correlate with the dissolved n2o concentration which was consistent with findings reported by previous studies stow et al 2005 yan et al 2012 harley et al 2015 wang et al 2015 hu et al 2016 higher riverine n2o emissions rates occurred ranged from 302 3 to 1043 7 μg n2o m2 d in the subbasins dominated by arable and residential land such as subbasins 31 and 36 lower n2o emission rates ranging from 41 5 to 163 4 μg n2o m2 d occurred in the subbasins dominated by forest and paddy fields such as subbasins 14 15 23 25 and 27 fig 7a this result indicates that as the proportions of arable and residential land use types increased there was a concurrent rise in the riverine dissolved n2o concentration and n2o emissions rates 4 discussion 4 1 riverine n2o emissions under cold temperature conditions rivers are subject to the freeze thaw cycles in cold temperate areas where the temperatures from november to march are below zero ouyang et al 2017a 2017c 2018b gao et al 2019 strong riverine n2o absorption and weak n2o emissions occurred from september to february indicating that streams or rivers in cold temperate areas could serve as a sink for atmospheric n2o this result is consistent with the observations of cold areas reported by soued et al 2016 the strong absorption and weak emissions during this period are supported by the following 1 the weak riverine n2o emissions have resulted from the lower gas transfer velocity at the water air interface which is controlled by the lower water temperature and river discharge during the winter rather than during the other seasons fig 6a and b and s3 this phenomenon also is supported by previous studies wanninkhof 1992 borges et al 2004 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 rasera et al 2013 fu et al 2018 2 the strong absorption or weak emissions have resulted from the higher equilibrium n2o concentrations induced by the higher fugacity of riverine n2o and higher atmospheric n2o concentrations during the winter figs 6d and s2 and 3 the riverine n2o absorption have resulted from the lower dissolved n2o concentration induced by lower diffuse nitrogen loads from the land s surface during winter fig 6c soued et al 2016 fu et al 2018 during the spring a sudden increase in the riverine n2o emissions occurred and coincided with sudden increases in the n2o transfer velocity kn2o and dissolved n2o concentration fu et al 2018 this scenario may have been induced by the sudden increases in diffuse nitrogen loads from the land s surface during the thawing period soued et al 2016 fu et al 2018 at the beginning of the growing season riverine n2o emissions also significantly increased due to the higher diffuse nitrogen load from the land s surface which was induced by tillage steeping fertilization and heavy precipitation events this significant increase also resulted from the combined impacts of the high n2o transfer velocity and low equilibrium n2o concentration there was a clear decrease from july to december due to the decrease in the dissolved n2o concentration and transfer velocity and increase in the equilibrium n2o concentration which were mainly controlled by water temperature and atmospheric n2o weiss and price 1980 the modeled monthly patterns of riverine n2o emissions in this study are consistent with the observations and simulations for cold areas reported by fu et al 2018 the above discussion indicates that the developed model can capture the temporal distribution of riverine n2o emissions and identify the temporal sinks or sources of atmospheric n2o in an agricultural watershed with a freeze thaw cycle the observed and simulated results indicate that the riverine n2o emissions spatially coincided with the dissolved n2o concentrations in our study this result was supported by the mean spatial distribution of riverine n2o emissions which followed a similar pattern to the dissolved n2o concentration harley et al 2015 wang et al 2015 a previous study stated that dissolved n2o concentration and its emissions in rivers had significant differences among different land uses hu et al 2016 in our study as the proportions of arable and residential land increased the riverine dissolved n2o concentrations and n2o emissions fluxes increased the relationship between the land use composition and riverine n2o emissions fluxes was also supported by harley 2013 and fu et al 2018 streams or rivers in subbasins dominated by forests and paddy fields could act as sinks for atmospheric n2o under cold temperature conditions while streams in subbasins dominated by arable and residential land could act as sources of atmospheric n2o which is mainly controlled by the diffuse nitrogen loads and runoff from surface land harley et al 2015 soued et al 2016 hu et al 2016 the riverine n2o emissions and dissolved n2o concentrations across the agricultural watershed were driven by the diffuse nitrogen loads from the land and riverine nitrogen concentrations which in turn were related to the proportion of agricultural residential and forestland areas in the subbasins 4 2 controls on the riverine n2o and the importance of dynamic atmospheric n2o the dissolved riverine n2o concentration showed a strong correlation with the din no 3 nh 4 concentration fig s1 indicating that the riverine n2o concentration and its emissions rates are mainly determined by the diffuse nitrogen loads and discharge from surface land consistent with findings reported by previous studies stow et al 2005 yan et al 2012 hu et al 2016 compared with previous empirical or semi empirical modeling turner et al 2016 fu et al 2018 there are some uncertainties for the new dissolved n2o concentration model however results in this study demonstrated that the dissolved riverine n2o concentration had a higher correlation with the din concentrations than with either the no 3 or nh 4 concentration alone fig s1 hu et al 2016 these results indicate that the riverine dissolved n2o concentration and its emission rates are derived from both nitrification and denitrification processes consistent with the results reported in several previous studies de klein et al 2006 yan et al 2012 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 hu et al 2016 turner et al 2016 lin et al 2016 hama aziz et al 2017 wang et al 2017 cooper et al 2017 fu et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the relative contribution of riverine nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions is mainly determined by land use which has different diffuse nitrogen loss processes through runoff river characteristics and other local environmental factors clough et al 2007 panagopoulos et al 2011 yan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 hu et al 2016 in a previous study a stronger correlation was found between the nh 4 concentrations and riverine n2o than between the no 3 concentrations and riverine n2o indicating that nitrification might produce a greater riverine n2o than denitrification in basins dominated by residential areas yu et al 2013 however our results show that riverine n2o concentration was mainly controlled by no 3 concentrations rather than the nh 4 concentrations fig s1 indicating that the relative contribution of riverine denitrification to n2o emissions can be greater than riverine nitrification in this middle high latitude agricultural watershed in northeastern china according to the data from the noaa esrl global monitoring division there is a difference in atmospheric n2o concentrations in different months and a significant increasing trend of atmospheric n2o concentrations occurred from 2000 to 2017 fig s2 however several studies have estimated riverine n2o emissions under the static atmospheric n2o concentrations marzadri et al 2014 2017 turner et al 2016 fu et al 2018 which is a key parameter for calculating the equilibrium n2o concentration weiss and price 1980 turner et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 a previous study showed that in comparison to using dynamic n2o concentrations using constant or static atmospheric n2o concentrations to estimate long term riverine n2o emissions variations could result in higher estimates of riverine denitrification and n2o emission rates and unreasonable spatiotemporal fluctuations in riverine n2o emissions böhlke et al 2009 our study shows that the riverine n2o emission rates can be overestimated under static atmospheric n2o rather than under increasing atmospheric n2o which is consistent with the results reported in the previous study böhlke et al 2009 this overestimation will become increasingly significant over time due to the continuous increase in the atmospheric n2o concentration this overestimate could result from that the equilibrium n2o concentration in the river exhibiting an increasing trend under increasing atmospheric n2o while presenting a decreasing trend under the static atmospheric n2o 4 3 implications for watershed nps pollution and best management practices a watershed scale model is a powerful tool for identifying specific moments and hotspots in riverine n2o emissions as well as the relationship between the diffuse nitrogen loading from land riverine n2o emission rates and atmospheric n2o concentrations the main aim of this study was to develop a complementary watershed scale riverine n2o emissions model swat fn2o that automatically combines terrestrial and riverine processes with dynamic atmospheric n2o to develop the best management practices bmps the swat fn2o model can reproduce these complex interactions between factors and describe how riverine n2o emissions or absorption respond to changing environmental factors such as temperature diffuse nitrogen loss from surface land and atmospheric n2o section 3 2 there are some uncertainties in the sampling data model validation results riverine dissolved n2o environmental factors and n2o flux simulations gassmann et al 2014 ouyang et al 2017a gao et al 2019 the riverine n2odisc and scn2o models parameterization procedure model coupling and its structure are also subject to uncertainties fu et al 2018 raymond et al 2012 for example the dissolved n2o concentration was calculated as a function of the riverine no 3 and nh 4 in this study and the n2odisc and swat fn2o did not perform well under low nitrogen levels dissolved n2o concentrations are more susceptible to temperature dissolved oxygen organic carbon and riverbed morphology under low nitrogen levels than under high nitrogen levels harrison and matson 2003 rosamond et al 2012 venkiteswaran et al 2014 marzadri et al 2017 the structure of the n2odisc model in this study can be improved when more field measurements such as those of dissolved oxygen and organic carbon levels become available fu et al 2018 some empirical regressions about schmidt number sc which is as a function of the water temperature have been widely used in the environmental model in the published literature rosamond et al 2012 yan et al 2012 marzadri et al 2014 2017 gardner et al 2016 soued et al 2016 fu et al 2018 in addition although the schmidt number scn2o calculated from wanninkhof 1992 is as a function of the riverine water temperature the simulated results were in close agreement with those calculated using the more comprehensive compilation of diffusion coefficients for n2o raymond et al 2012 the advantages of the swat fn2o model over the swat n2o model developed by fu et al 2018 are as follows first dissolved n2o concentration n2odisc models for low and high nitrogen levels were developed based on a function of the riverine no 3 and nh 4 by using 638 individual measurements which were obtained from different study areas based on the published literature second this model can simulate monthly atmospheric n2o concentrations dynamically which is a key parameter for calculating the equilibrium n2o concentration weiss and price 1980 turner et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 additionally users can quickly conduct and display spatiotemporal analyses using the spatiotemporal analysis module of swat fn2o in this study the model performance evaluation shows that the swat fn2o provided a reasonable magnitude of riverine n2o emissions according to section 3 1 the developed model presented reasonable seasonal and spatial patterns in riverine n2o emissions in the cold temperate agricultural watershed consistent with the seasonal pattern reported in the previous study fu et al 2018 the prevention and control of diffuse nitrogen loading from land and riverine n2o emissions to the atmosphere in an agricultural watershed are important for protecting the surface aquatic environment and reducing riverine greenhouse gas emissions bmps are an effective method for resolving issues related to the nonpoint source nitrogen pollution in the surface water the swat fn2o model can also assess how diffuse pollution and riverine n2o emissions or absorption respond to changing environmental and anthropogenic factors at daily monthly and yearly scales these are the main factors that are considered when researchers and managers develop and implement bmps ouyang et al 2017a additionally the swat fn2o model would allow researchers to efficiently assess the synergistic impacts of changes in land use and climate on soil and riverine n2o emissions or absorption to explore agricultural mitigation measures and bmps under climatic warming 5 conclusions 1 the swat fn2o model was developed for simulating riverine n2o emissions that combined terrestrial and riverine processes with considering the dynamic atmospheric n2o this new development and application efforts of swat fn2o model provide an alternative approach to reproduce riverine n2o emissions or absorption and to explore climate smart agricultural solutions under dynamic atmospheric n2o 2 the high riverine n2o emissions occurred from april to july accounting for 83 34 of the yearly emissions due to the sudden increase in diffuse nitrogen losses into rivers caused by snow melt tillage steeping fertilization and heavy precipitation events 3 the riverine n2o emissions rates in the subbasins dominated by forests and paddy fields were lower than those in the subbasins dominated by arable and residential land which could act as a source of atmospheric n2o 4 the riverine n2o emissions rates can be overestimated under the static atmospheric n2o rather than under increasing atmospheric n2o without considering the increasing atmospheric n2o

18045,modeling studies have focused on n2o emissions in temperate rivers under static atmospheric n2o n2oairc with cold temperate river networks under dynamic n2oairc receiving less attention to address this knowledge and methodological gap the dissolved n2o concentration n2odisc and n2oairc algorithms were integrated with an air water gas exchange model fn2o into the swat soil and water assessment tool this new model swat fn2o allows users to simulate daily riverine n2o emissions under dynamic atmospheric n2o the spatiotemporal fluctuations in the riverine n2o emissions was simulated and its response to the static and dynamic atmospheric n2o were analyzed in a middle high latitude agricultural watershed in northeastern china the results show that the swat fn2o model is a useful method for capturing the hotspots in riverine n2o emissions the model showed strong riverine n2o absorption and weak n2o emissions from september to february which acted as a sink for atmospheric n2o in this cold temperate area high n2o emissions occurred from april to july which accounted for 83 34 of the yearly emissions spatial analysis indicated that the main stream and its tributary could contribute 302 3 1043 7 and 41 5 163 4 μg n2o m2 d to the total riverine n2o emissions 15 02 t a respectively the riverine n2o emissions rates in the subbasins dominated by forests and paddy fields were lower than those in the subbasins dominated by arable and residential land riverine n2o emissions can be overestimated under the static atmospheric n2o rather than under the increasing atmospheric n2o this overestimation has increased from 1 52 to 23 97 from 1990 to 2016 under the static atmospheric n2o the results of this study are valuable for water quality and future climate change assessments that aim to protect aquatic and atmospheric environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords diffuse pollution nitrous oxide emissions dynamic atmospheric n2o water air interface

greenhouse gas in river networks de klein et al 2006 marzadri et al 2017 fu et al 2018 the identification fate and spatiotemporal assessments of riverine n2o emissions at the watershed scale are important for achieving water safety and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in river networks wang et al 2015 2017 most studies focusing on assessments of riverine n2o emissions at the watershed scale have been conducted by directly measuring riverine n2o emissions using chambers hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 turner et al 2015 or air water gas exchange models baulch et al 2011 yan et al 2012 marzadri et al 2014 gardner et al 2016 soued et al 2016 however continuous site monitoring and experiments are not feasible for assessing the spatiotemporal changes in riverine n2o emissions at the watershed scale because they require extensive labor and financial and material resources wang et al 2015 marzadri et al 2017 hence modeling is often the preferred approach for conducting watershed scale assessments bach et al 2010 ouyang et al 2017a 2017b keupers and willems 2017 watershed scale models are powerful for identifying the spatiotemporal changes in riverine n2o emissions fu et al 2018 and the relationship between the diffuse nitrogen loss and riverine n2o emissions to the atmosphere swat soil and water assessment tool is a semi distributed model designed to simulate the hydrological nutrient and carbon cycles in soil and rivers at the watershed scale arnold et al 1998 ouyang et al 2013 ouyang et al 2017a however the official version of swat has no function for modeling riverine n2o emissions the flexibility of swat has been confirmed in integrated model studies yang et al 2017 wagena et al 2017 wu et al 2019 gao et al 2019 the recently developed swat ghg wagena et al 2017 swat n2o yang et al 2017 shrestha et al 2018 shrestha and wang 2018 swat mkt bhanja et al 2019a 2019b and swat n2o coupler gao et al 2019 models can simulate changes in soil properties and hydrologic and crop management factors to estimate soil n2o emissions however these models focus on soil n2o emissions rather than riverine n2o emissions at the watershed scale beaulieu et al 2011 modified a global river network n removal model which combined an air water gas exchange model a transfer efficiency model for dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and din loading model to estimate global n2o production in river systems however this din loading model is an empirical based model that cannot represent the hydrological and nutrient processes in the terrestrial surface system at the watershed scale beaulieu et al 2011 hu et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 developed a process based watershed scale riverine n2o model but this model did not consider the impacts of diffuse nitrogen loss from the terrestrial surface to the river a recent study showed that an empirical based riverine dissolved n2o concentration model and the air water gas exchange model cloud be integrated into the swat to simulate riverine n2o emissions in which atmospheric n2o concentrations are assumed to be a constant value fu et al 2018 there was no submodel for simulating dynamic atmospheric n2o concentrations in the study turner et al 2016 fu et al 2018 which is a key parameter for calculating the equilibrium n2o concentration weiss and price 1980 turner et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 according to the data from the noaa esrl global monitoring division there is a difference in atmospheric n2o concentrations in different month and a significant increasing trend 308 19 in 1990 to 329 58 ppb in 2016 of atmospheric n2o concentrations occurred hall et al 2007 constant atmospheric n2o concentrations could result in higher estimates of riverine denitrification and n2o emission rates and unreasonable spatiotemporal fluctuations in riverine n2o emissions böhlke et al 2009 additionally the riverine dissolved n2o concentration modeling in previous study turner et al 2016 fu et al 2018 is using the michaelis menten kinetics function which only include the riverine no 3 concentration variable to predict the dissolved n2o concentration this function cannot reflect the impact of nh 4 concentration on dissolved n2o concentration also cannot present correctly the high dissolved n2o concentration modeling under the high nitrogen level in rivers section 2 2 2 the drawbacks of this model prevent it from comprehensively reflecting the effects of atmospheric n2o concentration variation on riverine n2o emissions thus there is an urgent need to resolve these inadequacies to better simulate riverine n2o emissions at a watershed scale new riverine dissolved n2o concentration and atmospheric n2o concentration algorithms should be developed and integrated with an air water gas exchange model in the swat model to build a complementary watershed scale riverine n2o emissions model to fulfill the objectives of this study the swat n2o coupler was employed as the framework gao et al 2019 then riverine dissolved n2o concentration models for low and high nitrogen levels were developed and atmospheric n2o concentration model were developed and integrated with the air water gas exchange model fn2o into the swat n2o coupler model to build a complementary watershed scale riverine n2o emissions model swat fn2o which combined terrestrial and riverine processes that considered the dynamic atmospheric n2o concentrations the swat fn2o model was demonstrated for simulating riverine n2o emissions in middle high latitude agricultural watersheds in northeastern china specifically 1 the detailed parameters and information for model calibration and validation can be found in section 2 3 2 table s1 and fig s3 and the model s performance is evaluated in section 3 1 2 the riverine theoretical equilibrium n2o concentration and n2o emissions variations under static and dynamic atmospheric n2o are analyzed in section 3 2 3 the riverine n2o emissions are spatiotemporally evaluated in section 3 3 4 the reasonability of the magnitude and seasonal patterns of the modeled riverine n2o emissions in an agricultural watershed under cold temperature conditions are discussed 5 the controls of riverine nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions in rivers and the importance of dynamic n2o for estimating the long term riverine n2o variations were discussed in section 4 2 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the naoli river watershed of the sangjiang plain is located in a middle high latitude agricultural area of northeastern china fig 1 it has a total drainage area of

algorithms effectively gao et al 2019 on the basis of the previous study one module and relevant submodules were added into the swat n2o coupler to develop the new model swat fn2o for simulating riverine n2o emissions in this study 1 a dissolved n2o concentration n2odisc model was developed based on a function of the riverine no 3 and nh 4 by using 638 individual measurements which were obtained from different study areas based on the published literature yan et al 2012 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 lin et al 2016 wang et al 2017 cooper et al 2017 2 an atmospheric n2o concentration

n2oeqc model and n2o transfer velocity model to simulate riverine n2o emissions for each reach the rate constants for nitrate and ammonium to dissolved n2o were used to calculate the proportion of nitrate or ammonium to dissolved n2o this rate constant can be obtained by calibration the new model can simulate and output daily n2o emissions rates and loads additionally users can quickly conduct and display spatiotemporal analysis the operational structure of the swat fn2o model is presented in fig 3 2 3 demonstration of swat fn2o model 2 3 1 swat fn2o model initialization the developed swat fn2o model was initialized for the naoli river watershed in this study the land use in 2014 was interpreted based on landsat 8 images using supervised classification and the images were manually

applied to validate the swat fn2o model results in this study zhu et al 2012 due to the case study locates in the middle high latitude area the water in the winter period was frozen and the samples cannot be taken it is difficult to collect and measure long term riverine nitrogen concentration it is an alternative way to use the limited observation from different reaches to validate the simulated riverine nitrogen ouyang et al 2017a in this study the 18 reaches for no 3 and nh 4 concentrations in surface water 0 5 m which were sampled and measured in september 2016 were used to validate the riverine nitrogen concentration simulated by the swat fn2o model fig 4 c the final step was the validation of the riverine n2o to evaluate the performance of the established n2odisc model 538 observed data points from the established database were used to train the n2odisc model and 100 observed data points were used to test the model fig 4a and b due to the lack of a long term observed riverine n2o the 18 reaches for riverine n2o in the naoli river watershed were used to validate the riverine n2o simulated by the swat fn2o model fig 4d 2 3 3 modeling of riverine n2o under

developed model can capture the magnitude and spatial patterns of riverine din concentrations and n2o emissions rates for different reaches therefore the swat fn2o model could explain 74 89 of the variability in the dissolved riverine n2o concentration and approximately 81 and 87 of the variability in the riverine din concentration and n2o emission rates respectively while the swat outputs the correct riverine environmental parameters 3 2 riverine n2o variation under the static and dynamic atmospheric n2o the swat fn2o allows variations of riverine dissolved n2o concentration n2odisc equilibrium n2o concentration n2oeqc and n2o emission rates fn2o under the static and dynamic atmospheric n2o to be elucidated at a yearly mean daily scale the modeling results showed that riverine n2o emissions rates under the static and dynamic atmospheric n2o present the similar variations trend ranging from 231 88 to 432 51 μg n2o m2 d over the past few decades which were mainly controlled by the dissolved n2o concentration however the riverine n2o emissions rates have been overestimated under static atmospheric n2o rather than under increasing atmospheric n2o increased from 308 19 in 1990 to 329 58 ppb in 2016 fig s2 this overestimation has been increased from 1 52 to 23 97 under static atmospheric n2o from 1990 to 2016 fig 5 a during the past few decades the fugacity of riverine n2o presented a decreasing trend due to the increasing water temperature in the river fig 5b weiss and price 1980 the decreased fugacity of riverine n2o resulted in a decreasing trend in the equilibrium n2o concentration in the river under static atmospheric n2o which is different from the increasing trend of the equilibrium n2o concentration under increasing atmospheric n2o fig 5c this scenario is the reason that the riverine n2o emissions rates can be overestimated under the static atmospheric n2o rather than under the increasing atmospheric n2o 3 3 spatiotemporal pattern in riverine n2o emissions fluxes obvious temporal differences were observed in the riverine n2o emission fluxes dissolved n2o concentrations and theoretical equilibrium n2o concentrations at a monthly scale fig 6 these variations were controlled by the variations in the nitrogen levels on the land surface and in the river induced by management practices including the timing of tillage fertilization and harvest and temporal climatic variations such as freezing thawing and precipitating in this middle high latitude agricultural watershed fu et al 2018 gao et al 2019 the riverine n2o emissions exhibited considerable monthly variation across the river watershed with emissions rates ranging from 568 to 1078 μg n m2 d and a mean emission rate of 253 μg n m2 d this result is similar to the results 200 to 1150 μg n m2 d reported by harley et al 2015 the monthly n2o emissions were impacted by the seasonal cycles of temperature transfer velocities dissolved n2o concentrations and theoretical equilibrium n2o concentrations fig 6 the n2o emission rates increased rapidly from march to april which coincided with the sudden increases in the dissolved n2o concentrations and gas transfer velocities which were induced by the freeze thaw and precipitation events fig 6 fu et al 2018 due to the snow melting induced by increasing temperature 0 c in april the n2o emission rates increased by 270 compared with the march fig 6a in comparison to other months in april to july higher n2o emissions occurred under the higher dissolved n2o concentration and lower equilibrium n2o concentration fig 6c and d this period was the main period acting as a source of atmospheric n2o throughout the year which accounted for 83 34 of the yearly emissions the lower dissolved n2o concentration and transfer velocities and higher equilibrium n2o concentration occurred from september to march which resulted in the lower n2o emission rates and this period acted as a sink for atmospheric n2o fig 6b and d the spatial variations in the riverine n2o were identified by the large scale environmental changes occurring in the watershed which included the dissolved n2o concentrations the dominant land use types and diffuse nitrogen loads from the land s surface in the subbasins fig 7 a spatially different land use cover presented the different n2o emissions rates upland paddy field river fig 7b the n2o emission load from agricultural system 12198 47 t yr is much larger than n2o emission load from river networks 15 02 t yr mainly due to the higher portion of agricultural land area table 1 riverine n2o emissions were found to correlate with the dissolved n2o concentration which was consistent with findings reported by previous studies stow et al 2005 yan et al 2012 harley et al 2015 wang et al 2015 hu et al 2016 higher riverine n2o emissions rates occurred ranged from 302 3 to 1043 7 μg n2o m2 d in the subbasins dominated by arable and residential land such as subbasins 31 and 36 lower n2o emission rates ranging from 41 5 to 163 4 μg n2o m2 d occurred in the subbasins dominated by forest and paddy fields such as subbasins 14 15 23 25 and 27 fig 7a this result indicates that as the proportions of arable and residential land use types increased there was a concurrent rise in the riverine dissolved n2o concentration and n2o emissions rates 4 discussion 4 1 riverine n2o emissions under cold temperature conditions rivers are subject to the freeze thaw cycles in cold temperate areas where the temperatures from november to march are below zero ouyang et al 2017a 2017c 2018b gao et al 2019 strong riverine n2o absorption and weak n2o emissions occurred from september to february indicating that streams or rivers in cold temperate areas could serve as a sink for atmospheric n2o this result is consistent with the observations of cold areas reported by soued et al 2016 the strong absorption and weak emissions during this period are supported by the following 1 the weak riverine n2o emissions have resulted from the lower gas transfer velocity at the water air interface which is controlled by the lower water temperature and river discharge during the winter rather than during the other seasons fig 6a and b and s3 this phenomenon also is supported by previous studies wanninkhof 1992 borges et al 2004 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 rasera et al 2013 fu et al 2018 2 the strong absorption or weak emissions have resulted from the higher equilibrium n2o concentrations induced by the higher fugacity of riverine n2o and higher atmospheric n2o concentrations during the winter figs 6d and s2 and 3 the riverine n2o absorption have resulted from the lower dissolved n2o concentration induced by lower diffuse nitrogen loads from the land s surface during winter fig 6c soued et al 2016 fu et al 2018 during the spring a sudden increase in the riverine n2o emissions occurred and coincided with sudden increases in the n2o transfer velocity kn2o and dissolved n2o concentration fu et al 2018 this scenario may have been induced by the sudden increases in diffuse nitrogen loads from the land s surface during the thawing period soued et al 2016 fu et al 2018 at the beginning of the growing season riverine n2o emissions also significantly increased due to the higher diffuse nitrogen load from the land s surface which was induced by tillage steeping fertilization and heavy precipitation events this significant increase also resulted from the combined impacts of the high n2o transfer velocity and low equilibrium n2o concentration there was a clear decrease from july to december due to the decrease in the dissolved n2o concentration and transfer velocity and increase in the equilibrium n2o concentration which were mainly controlled by water temperature and atmospheric n2o weiss and price 1980 the modeled monthly patterns of riverine n2o emissions in this study are consistent with the observations and simulations for cold areas reported by fu et al 2018 the above discussion indicates that the developed model can capture the temporal distribution of riverine n2o emissions and identify the temporal sinks or sources of atmospheric n2o in an agricultural watershed with a freeze thaw cycle the observed and simulated results indicate that the riverine n2o emissions spatially coincided with the dissolved n2o concentrations in our study this result was supported by the mean spatial distribution of riverine n2o emissions which followed a similar pattern to the dissolved n2o concentration harley et al 2015 wang et al 2015 a previous study stated that dissolved n2o concentration and its emissions in rivers had significant differences among different land uses hu et al 2016 in our study as the proportions of arable and residential land increased the riverine dissolved n2o concentrations and n2o emissions fluxes increased the relationship between the land use composition and riverine n2o emissions fluxes was also supported by harley 2013 and fu et al 2018 streams or rivers in subbasins dominated by forests and paddy fields could act as sinks for atmospheric n2o under cold temperature conditions while streams in subbasins dominated by arable and residential land could act as sources of atmospheric n2o which is mainly controlled by the diffuse nitrogen loads and runoff from surface land harley et al 2015 soued et al 2016 hu et al 2016 the riverine n2o emissions and dissolved n2o concentrations across the agricultural watershed were driven by the diffuse nitrogen loads from the land and riverine nitrogen concentrations which in turn were related to the proportion of agricultural residential and forestland areas in the subbasins 4 2 controls on the riverine n2o and the importance of dynamic atmospheric n2o the dissolved riverine n2o concentration showed a strong correlation with the din no 3 nh 4 concentration fig s1 indicating that the riverine n2o concentration and its emissions rates are mainly determined by the diffuse nitrogen loads and discharge from surface land consistent with findings reported by previous studies stow et al 2005 yan et al 2012 hu et al 2016 compared with previous empirical or semi empirical modeling turner et al 2016 fu et al 2018 there are some uncertainties for the new dissolved n2o concentration model however results in this study demonstrated that the dissolved riverine n2o concentration had a higher correlation with the din concentrations than with either the no 3 or nh 4 concentration alone fig s1 hu et al 2016 these results indicate that the riverine dissolved n2o concentration and its emission rates are derived from both nitrification and denitrification processes consistent with the results reported in several previous studies de klein et al 2006 yan et al 2012 hinshaw and dahlgren 2013 hu et al 2016 turner et al 2016 lin et al 2016 hama aziz et al 2017 wang et al 2017 cooper et al 2017 fu et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the relative contribution of riverine nitrification and denitrification to n2o emissions is mainly determined by land use which has different diffuse nitrogen loss processes through runoff river characteristics and other local environmental factors clough et al 2007 panagopoulos et al 2011 yan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 hu et al 2016 in a previous study a stronger correlation was found between the nh 4 concentrations and riverine n2o than between the no 3 concentrations and riverine n2o indicating that nitrification might produce a greater riverine n2o than denitrification in basins dominated by residential areas yu et al 2013 however our results show that riverine n2o concentration was mainly controlled by no 3 concentrations rather than the nh 4 concentrations fig s1 indicating that the relative contribution of riverine denitrification to n2o emissions can be greater than riverine nitrification in this middle high latitude agricultural watershed in northeastern china according to the data from the noaa esrl global monitoring division there is a difference in atmospheric n2o concentrations in different months and a significant increasing trend of atmospheric n2o concentrations occurred from 2000 to 2017 fig s2 however several studies have estimated riverine n2o emissions under the static atmospheric n2o concentrations marzadri et al 2014 2017 turner et al 2016 fu et al 2018 which is a key parameter for calculating the equilibrium n2o concentration weiss and price 1980 turner et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 a previous study showed that in comparison to using dynamic n2o concentrations using constant or static atmospheric n2o concentrations to estimate long term riverine n2o emissions variations could result in higher estimates of riverine denitrification and n2o emission rates and unreasonable spatiotemporal fluctuations in riverine n2o emissions böhlke et al 2009 our study shows that the riverine n2o emission rates can be overestimated under static atmospheric n2o rather than under increasing atmospheric n2o which is consistent with the results reported in the previous study böhlke et al 2009 this overestimation will become increasingly significant over time due to the continuous increase in the atmospheric n2o concentration this overestimate could result from that the equilibrium n2o concentration in the river exhibiting an increasing trend under increasing atmospheric n2o while presenting a decreasing trend under the static atmospheric n2o 4 3 implications for watershed nps pollution and best management practices a watershed scale model is a powerful tool for identifying specific moments and hotspots in riverine n2o emissions as well as the relationship between the diffuse nitrogen loading from land riverine n2o emission rates and atmospheric n2o concentrations the main aim of this study was to develop a complementary watershed scale riverine n2o emissions model swat fn2o that automatically combines terrestrial and riverine processes with dynamic atmospheric n2o to develop the best management practices bmps the swat fn2o model can reproduce these complex interactions between factors and describe how riverine n2o emissions or absorption respond to changing environmental factors such as temperature diffuse nitrogen loss from surface land and atmospheric n2o section 3 2 there are some uncertainties in the sampling data model validation results riverine dissolved n2o environmental factors and n2o flux simulations gassmann et al 2014 ouyang et al 2017a gao et al 2019 the riverine n2odisc and scn2o models parameterization procedure model coupling and its structure are also subject to uncertainties fu et al 2018 raymond et al 2012 for example the dissolved n2o concentration was calculated as a function of the riverine no 3 and nh 4 in this study and the n2odisc and swat fn2o did not perform well under low nitrogen levels dissolved n2o concentrations are more susceptible to temperature dissolved oxygen organic carbon and riverbed morphology under low nitrogen levels than under high nitrogen levels harrison and matson 2003 rosamond et al 2012 venkiteswaran et al 2014 marzadri et al 2017 the structure of the n2odisc model in this study can be improved when more field measurements such as those of dissolved oxygen and organic carbon levels become available fu et al 2018 some empirical regressions about schmidt number sc which is as a function of the water temperature have been widely used in the environmental model in the published literature rosamond et al 2012 yan et al 2012 marzadri et al 2014 2017 gardner et al 2016 soued et al 2016 fu et al 2018 in addition although the schmidt number scn2o calculated from wanninkhof 1992 is as a function of the riverine water temperature the simulated results were in close agreement with those calculated using the more comprehensive compilation of diffusion coefficients for n2o raymond et al 2012 the advantages of the swat fn2o model over the swat n2o model developed by fu et al 2018 are as follows first dissolved n2o concentration n2odisc models for low and high nitrogen levels were developed based on a function of the riverine no 3 and nh 4 by using 638 individual measurements which were obtained from different study areas based on the published literature second this model can simulate monthly atmospheric n2o concentrations dynamically which is a key parameter for calculating the equilibrium n2o concentration weiss and price 1980 turner et al 2016 marzadri et al 2017 additionally users can quickly conduct and display spatiotemporal analyses using the spatiotemporal analysis module of swat fn2o in this study the model performance evaluation shows that the swat fn2o provided a reasonable magnitude of riverine n2o emissions according to section 3 1 the developed model presented reasonable seasonal and spatial patterns in riverine n2o emissions in the cold temperate agricultural watershed consistent with the seasonal pattern reported in the previous study fu et al 2018 the prevention and control of diffuse nitrogen loading from land and riverine n2o emissions to the atmosphere in an agricultural watershed are important for protecting the surface aquatic environment and reducing riverine greenhouse gas emissions bmps are an effective method for resolving issues related to the nonpoint source nitrogen pollution in the surface water the swat fn2o model can also assess how diffuse pollution and riverine n2o emissions or absorption respond to changing environmental and anthropogenic factors at daily monthly and yearly scales these are the main factors that are considered when researchers and managers develop and implement bmps ouyang et al 2017a additionally the swat fn2o model would allow researchers to efficiently assess the synergistic impacts of changes in land use and climate on soil and riverine n2o emissions or absorption to explore agricultural mitigation measures and bmps under climatic warming 5 conclusions 1 the swat fn2o model was developed for simulating riverine n2o emissions that combined terrestrial and riverine processes with considering the dynamic atmospheric n2o this new development and application efforts of swat fn2o model provide an alternative approach to reproduce riverine n2o emissions or absorption and to explore climate smart agricultural solutions under dynamic atmospheric n2o 2 the high riverine n2o emissions occurred from april to july accounting for 83 34 of the yearly emissions due to the sudden increase in diffuse nitrogen losses into rivers caused by snow melt tillage steeping fertilization and heavy precipitation events 3 the riverine n2o emissions rates in the subbasins dominated by forests and paddy fields were lower than those in the subbasins dominated by arable and residential land which could act as a source of atmospheric n2o 4 the riverine n2o emissions rates can be overestimated under the static atmospheric n2o rather than under increasing atmospheric n2o without considering the increasing atmospheric n2o

18046,the sources of microplastics and other anthropogenic particles in freshwater are not well understood the greater toronto area canada s most populous urban area offers a great study area for understanding the sources and pathways for microplastics to enter freshwater ecosystems here we quantified and characterized microplastics and other anthropogenic particles from lake ontario surface waters and source waters including stormwater runoff agricultural runoff and treated wastewater effluent to better understand sources to the great lakes anthropogenic particle concentrations in lake samples were 0 8 particles l 1 in source waters average concentrations were relatively higher in stormwater and wastewater with 15 4 particles l 1 and 13 3 particles l 1 respectively compared to 0 9 particles l 1 on average in agricultural runoff source waters revealed distinct signatures related to the morphologies of anthropogenic particles e g fibers in wastewater in addition many upstream watershed characteristics were found to be significant predictors of anthropogenic particle concentration proximity to urban areas were positively correlated to anthropogenic particle concentrations future studies should focus on local source apportionment to inform management and prevent further contamination of microplastics to freshwater ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic great lakes source apportionment runoff wastewater 1 introduction microplastics plastic particles 5 mm in size have been found in freshwater bodies across the world including on

in the laurentian great lakes to 100 mp l 1 in the surface waters of canals in amsterdam leslie et al 2017 relative to the oceans there have been less studies sampling freshwater ecosystems blettler et al 2018 moreover methods of sampling particle sizes included and reporting units are generally inconsistent making it difficult to compare across locations hidalgo ruz et al 2012 dris et al 2018 still based on the current body of literature microplastic concentrations in surface waters have been found to be comparable and sometimes even higher in freshwater systems compared to marine see table s1 microplastics found in freshwater bodies can contaminate wildlife including sportfish silva cavalcanti et al 2017 and birds brookson et al 2019 they have also been found to contaminate natural resources such as drinking water pivokonsky et al 2018 drawn from freshwater ecosystems concern has been raised about effects of microplastics to humans based on research showing exposure

source of microplastics to the environment is of critical importance as it can inform mitigation to prevent future contamination and minimize the likelihood of further effects the most practical means to mitigate contamination and avoid any resulting harm is to know where the pollutant originates and cut it off at its source sources of microplastics include broken down litter microbeads in personal

canadian side has 104 subwatersheds draining into it with an area of 38 472 km2 located along lake ontario s shores in the northwest is the greater toronto area gta home to canada s largest urban area with a population of 6 3 million residents city of toronto 2019 agriculture is also prevalent in the upper portions of the watersheds that contain the gta with 19 266 farms providing 12 billion cad to canada s economy fao 2019 sampling of wwtp effluent urban stormwater runoff and agricultural runoff was conducted to obtain information on microplastic and other anthropogenic particle abundance and character providing source information lake waters adjacent to toronto which receive river and wastewaters were also sampled for comparison fig 1 all samples were collected between july 28th and october 14th 2015 2 2 sample collection final wwtp effluent was collected from three treatment plants in the region referred to as wwtp a wwtp b and wwtp c three 24 h composites 4 l volume were sampled on three separate days from each plant using automated isco 6712 samplers to collect 167 ml each hour urban stormwater runoff samples were collected from three urban rivers etobicoke creek humber river and don river and the agricultural watershed samples were collected from three small streams downstream of agricultural areas elgin west bruce creek and little rouge stormwater and agricultural runoff samples 4 l each were collected in triplicate during wet weather over the course of one day using a stainless steel bucket with polypropylene rope from a bridge and transferred to an amber glass winchester bottle lake water samples consisted of 10 l grab samples taken from four sites in lake ontario off toronto one in the plume of the humber river one in the plume of wwtp b one in humber bay and one in toronto harbour near the mouth of the don river keating channel three replicates were collected at each lake site using the stainless steel bucket off the side of a monitoring vessel and transferred to clean polyethylene bags in a plastic bucket for all sampling events one field blank was sampled from one location for each of the four types of samples to account for any procedural contamination field blanks were sampled in an identical fashion to the samples but with reverse osmosis ro water from the laboratory all sample bottles were washed with soap and water and triple rinsed with ro water prior to sampling the stainless steel bucket was rinsed three times with site water prior to sampling to prevent cross contamination samples were taken back to the ministry of the environment conservation and parks laboratory for processing while quantification and characterization occurred at the university of toronto 2 3 sample processing and analysis upon return to the laboratory all samples were filtered through a 10 μm polycarbonate filter 142 mm diameter emd millipore isopore via a stainless steel filter holder millipore sigma and stored sealed in a clean glass petri dish the filtrate was collected and the water volume was measured using a graduated cylinder and recorded for every set of 10 samples filtered a laboratory blank with ro water was included to account for any procedural contamination in the laboratory samples and blanks were subjected to further clean up via a density separation technique each large sample filter was placed into a clean glass jar with a plastic lid containing 550 ml of ro water then agitated in an ultrasonic bath fisher scientific m series 120v for 1 2 h the filter was then removed and rinsed and the remaining water with the sample particles was sieved down to 25 μm and transferred to a clean glass separatory funnel with 170 ml of filtered saturated calcium chloride solution cacl2 ρ 1 4 g l the funnel was shaken for 20 s then left for 1 3 days to allow for adequate separation if during separation substantial material was observed sticking to the side of the glass funnel the bottom of the sample was released on the second day shaken for 20 s and left for another day to separate after separation the dense material in the bottom of the funnel was released and discarded the remaining sample was then separated into two size fractions 25 125 μm and 125 μm by stacking a 125 μm sieve on top of a 25 μm one and pouring the solution through those making sure to have a collection pan to catch the cacl2 for proper disposal each size fraction was then filtered onto individual 10 μm polycarbonate filters 47 mm diameter and stored in a clean glass petri dish the 125 μm size fraction was evaluated for this study particle counting and characterization by shape and color was completed with a stereomicroscope first with a black background to look for clear white particles and then with a white background for colored particles all personnel were trained in the same manner and the first three samples completed were evaluated by the trainer for inconsistencies counting guides shaw institute n d examples from publications helm 2017 and past sample sets were all used for training particles were grouped into twelve shape categories foam fiber fiber bundle fragment commercial fragment film pellet sphere paint tire road wear sud soap like hard fragments that fell apart when probed but were chemically identified to be of anthropogenic origin and gel they were also grouped by basic colors e g red yellow silver gold multi colored and an additional category of clear blue due to the existence of numerous clear fibers with blue patches all particles were counted and characterized by color category for measurements of length and width a maximum of 20 particles of each color category combination e g blue fiber were picked manually off the filter due to time constraints with forceps and placed onto double sided sticky tape to be imaged and measured using imagej software characterization of each picked particle was confirmed by two researchers to check consistency the sum of particles in relevant field and lab blank samples were subtracted by color category to account for contamination a subset of the particles from all samples were chemically identified given the large number of particles counted and time considerations we chose a representative 10 by color category to be chemically identified across all samples except for blanks where all non fibers were identified our final results presented for chemical identification were blank subtracted by color category chemical for all non fibers for fibers this subtraction was not necessary because the fibers in the blank were subtracted first by color category and then the remaining 10 of fibers in the samples were chemically identified the chemical identification was completed using micro raman spectroscopy horiba raman xplora plus for particles unable to be handled with forceps chemical identification with raman was done in labspec6 software using a 785 nm range 50 2000 cm 1 or 532 nm range 50 4000 cm 1 laser with primarily a 100x long working distance microscope objective and occasionally 50x objective with a filter ranging from 0 1 to 100 gratings of 600 or 1200 grooves mm 1 or up to 10 s for acquisition time 2 4 6 8 or 10 number of accumulations a confocal hole diameter of 100 μm or 300 μm and a confocal slit width of 50 or 100 μm when acquiring spectra parameters would be optimized to inhibit poor resolution fluorescence and other issues this results in particles having a different suite of parameters for example the 785 nm would provide a better spectrum for darkly colored particles the spectral library used was biorad knowitall raman spectral library of which certain databases were more extensively used including bio rad sadtler e g polymers monomers basic polymers processing chemicals horiba scientific e g forensic and wiley e g sigma aldrich library of raman spectra for particles able to be handled with forceps attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir bruker alpha ii with a diamond internal reflection element and opus 3d software was used for chemical identification with 24 background and sample scans and a spectral range wavenumber of 400 to 4000 cm 1 the spectrum was matched to built in bruker libraries and the primpke et al 2018 library for both raman and ftir a spectral match generally fell between 80 and 98 with a few exceptions made based on personal judgement chemical confirmation indicated anthropogenic particles were visually identified successfully at an average success rate of 93 across source types when excluding particles not able to be chemically identified and 77 on average across source types assuming those unable to be chemically identified were non anthropogenic 2 4 contamination control several laboratory practices were implemented to avoid contamination of samples with plastic and other anthropogenic material all materials used during extraction and analysis were washed and scrubbed

samples were kept covered to prevent contamination from the air plastic use was minimized or accounted for via lab and field blanks as noted above 2 5 data analysis we used nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds to examine patterns of assemblage structure of microplastics i e by category color category and polymer type among sources and with microplastics found in the lake we used plastic categories i e shapes plastic category color and polymer types to make separate two dimensional ordinations nmds plots were run using euclidean distances we excluded one wwtp sample from all plots because it was an outlier we used the function metamds in the vegan community ecology package oksanen et al 2008 in r bivariate regressions were conducted using r software to examine whether upstream watershed characteristics influenced the quantity of particles in surface waters we took into account model assumptions including residual normality by examining histograms and qq plots and log transformed all the data the following predictor variables were included watershed traits population density sum of road length plastic industry slope end of life vehicle yards and watershed land cover urban green water agriculture this relationship was also assessed with these same characteristics but within a riparian zone the water quality of rivers can be influenced at the full watershed or riparian zone scale sliva and williams 2001 tran et al 2010 beacon environmental ltd 2012 evaluated studies for buffer zone width that attenuate pollutants from entering waterways and the maximum recommended width was 90 m so to be conservative we chose 100 m predictor variables were chosen based on their likelihood to contribute plastics to the environment data sources for predictors can be found in table s3 with maps of plastic industries in fig s1 population in fig s2 and land cover in fig s3 3 results 3 1 anthropogenic particles in source waters the average concentrations stdev of microplastics and other anthropogenic particles per sample type are 13 3 15 5 particles l 1 in wastewater effluent 0 9 1 3 particles l 1 in agricultural runoff 15 4 7 9 particles l 1 in stormwater runoff and 0 8 0 7 particles l 1 in the lake fig 2 see tables s4 and s5 for values on average the particle lengths and widths are 1 2 1 0 mm and 0 07 0 1 mm in wastewater effluent 0 5 0 5 mm and 0 2 0 2 mm in agricultural runoff 0 9 0 9 mm and 0 2 0 2 mm in stormwater runoff and 1 0 0 9 mm and 0 3 0 2 mm in the lake respectively for more information on lengths and widths see figs s4 s5 table s6 particle categories are shown in fig 3 for each watershed type fibers are the dominant category in wastewater treatment plant effluent 90 relative abundance and to a lesser extent in stormwater runoff 41 tire and road wear particles made up 22 of particles in stormwater and were not found in other sample types categories in agricultural runoff and lake samples are diverse with no overwhelmingly dominating category colors of the particles are summarized for each sample type in fig s6 the dominant color for agriculture stormwater and lake samples is clear white accounting for half while wastewater effluent is more mixed with 32 blue 24 clear white 13 clear blue and various colors remaining detailed results by sample type and location are provided in figs s7 s18 of the supporting information the chemical identification of the anthropogenic particles is shown in fig 4 wastewater effluent and lake samples have less diversity of chemical types then agriculture and stormwater runoff 3 2 relationships among sample types the nmds plots yielded a pattern whereby sources stormwater wastewater and agricultural runoff grouped when run with anthropogenic particles grouped by categories 2d stress 0 004 fig 5 a and color category 2d stress 0 05 fig 5b when particles were grouped by chemical identification groupings are not existent 2d stress 0 13 fig 5c for categories and color category where groupings by source are apparent the anthropogenic particle assemblages in surface waters from the lake group most with agriculture followed by stormwater fig 5a and b 3 3 relationships with watershed characteristics at the upstream watershed scale eight of the nine predictor variables had statistically significant bivariate relationships with mean particle l 1 table s7 although plastic industry had the highest explained variation with 79 there were no plastic industries upstream of agricultural watersheds and so the graph lacks data between the two extremes along the x axis see fig 6 bottom right suggesting the results should be taken with caution the predictors indicative of urbanized areas like population density and urban percent have the next highest explained variation fig 6 detailed results for the riparian zone and particle concentration regression models can be found in the supporting information table s8 overall there are little differences between these and the upstream watershed regressions 4 discussion overall we found microplastics and other anthropogenic particles in all sample types and across all locations we found that the characteristics of particles associated with different source waters was unique for wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent and stormwater runoff wwtp effluent was dominated by fibers whereby stormwater runoff had the unique component of black rubbery particles that resembled tire and road wear particles we also found that concentrations of microplastics and other anthropogenic particles in lake ontario streams were correlated with urbanization in the region 4 1 wastewater effluent our results demonstrate that wwtp effluent is a key pathway for microplastics and other anthropogenic particles to enter lake ontario the average concentration of anthropogenic particles in wastewater effluent 13 3 15 5 particles l 1 is higher than concentrations found in nine of eleven studies see table s2 however further sampling should be done to determine a more precise estimate as our study showed a high variability amongst replicates e g as low as 0 3 particles l 1 and as high as 4 4 particles l 1 in wwtp a and had a small sample set microfibers comprised 90 on average of the particles released through wastewater effluent other studies have also found fibers to be the predominant category type in wastewater effluent browne et al 2011 mason et al 2016 prata 2018 the make up of the fiber colors in wastewater effluent in this study are blue clear blue and blue make up 50 clear white make up 25 and dark black and grey make up 16 fig s19 most of the blue fibers were chemically identified as indigo indigo carmine or cellulose 87 one source of these fibers to waste water is from the washing of blue denim jeans mcqueen et al 2017 denim jeans are made of cotton one type of cellulosic material textile dyed with indigo to make blue denim wolf 2011 the remaining fibers were a mix of cellulose polyester and other synthetic fibers e g polyurethane a material used in spandex roughly half of the fibers found were not identified as a polymer type because dyes masked the underlying chemical composition of the fiber fig s20 a significant source of these fibers to wastewater is the washing of garments and other textiles boucher and friot 2017 yang et al 2019 other potential sources are materials flushed down toilets such as wet wipes and feminine hygiene products that may contain plastics like polyester munoz et al 2018 additionally the treatment plants sampled receive sewer overflows water from urban runoff during high flows and so direct littering of textiles or fiber shedding into the atmosphere that has settled into the system can also be sources amongst the remaining non fiber particles we found sixteen gel particles in effluent from wwtp a and b the subset of these that were chemically identified were all silicone polymers one silicone particle was also found in the don river downstream of wwtp c other studies have found silicone in surface water hendrickson et al 2018 fish biginagwa et al 2016 and sediment ballent et al 2016 silicone polymers are made up of a silicone oxygen backbone and not a carbon backbone like the classical petro based polymers some typical applications of them include breast implants cookware hair conditioners and more verschoor et al 2016 ballent et al 2016 identified silicone in lake ontario sediments noting that silicone is among the polymeric materials produced in canada ciac 2014 and suggesting that silicone polymers also settle in lake ontario sediment we find here that wastewater effluent is a pathway to which these polymers enter the watershed however there are likely additional pathways given the multiple sources discussed 4 2 agricultural runoff agricultural runoff had the lowest concentration of anthropogenic particles compared to the other source types of those anthropogenic particles that were found they cannot be fully attributed to agricultural uses as the upstream watersheds were not entirely made up of agricultural fields elgin west had 63 agricultural land and 20 urban area bruce creek had 46 agricultural and 27 urban area and little rouge had 65 agricultural and 18 urban area the use of plastic materials for agricultural practices termed plasticulture is a potential source of microplastics from agricultural fields rochman 2018 for example irrigation is employed in ontario statistics canada 2016 omafra 2019a and a commonly used polymer for irrigation pipes is pvc and ldpe hdpe andrady 2003 which we did find in our samples another example are greenhouse films made from pe or eva copolymers andrady 2003 both polymers were present in the little rouge samples and greenhouses were present upstream based on the land cover data there are many applications of plastic in agriculture e g nursery pots tile drainage and a diversity of chemical types as well so detailed sampling would need to be done to confirm and assess the contribution of each to microplastics abundance sewage sludge is applied to agricultural fields in ontario omafra 2019b and found from other studies to be a major sink for microplastics from wastewater effluent with 95 being diverted from the final effluent murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017 however based on spatial data of non agricultural source material nasm from 2019 which includes sewage sludge omafra 2019b the agricultural watersheds sampled in this study did not have sewage sludge applied to them and so may not be a source of microplastics in our samples 4 3 urban stormwater runoff urban areas are significant hotspots for microplastics baldwin et al 2016 hitchcock and mitrovic 2019 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2017 and our study illustrates that urban centers are important contributors of microplastics to lake ontario from our samples the diversity of chemical types in stormwater runoff fig 4 suggests a high diversity of sources including plastic industries littering roads and wastewater effluent although it is not fully clear the contribution of plastic manufacturing industry to microplastic abundance in the watersheds sampled it is still a source that should be considered a considerable number of plastic manufacturing and recycling industries are located in southern ontario ballent et al 2016 this study figs s1 and s2 and of all provinces and territories ontario has the largest gdp for plastics and rubber manufacturing innovation science and economic development canada 2017 2018 microplastic particles with characteristics consistent with manufacturing and recycling processes flash trimmings are indicated to be present in toronto area waters and sediments helm 2017 ballent et al 2016 in other studies on the great lakes commercial fragments and pellets have been found in environmental samples ballent et al 2016 corcoran et al 2015 helm 2017 zbyszewski et al 2014 corcoran et al 2015 found the most common type of microplastics to be pellets at a humber bay beach site due to the low volumes sampled we did not collect any pellets and found only a small number of fragments indicated to be generated from commercial activities 1 it is thus less clear whether there are specific chemical types or categories that can be linked back to the industrial sources the commercial fragments were found in etobicoke creek and chemically identified as polyethylene and polyethylene methacrylate suggesting that any manufacturers producing these polymers could be spilling these plastics into the watershed this watershed has the largest number of plastic manufacturing industries approximately 56 of all watersheds in lake ontario litter materials intentionally discarded to the environment and debris materials lost by wind from properties recycling etc are sources of anthropogenic materials to the environment that is more prevalent in urban areas litter could not be included in regression models due to lack of data on the distribution of litter debris across watersheds however based on shoreline clean up data from the gta table s9 litter and debris are likely contributors to the abundance of microplastics as these materials break up in the environment the top item found is often cigarette butts made with cellulose acetate and we did find cellulose acetate in the stormwater samples all other polymeric chemicals that make up the debris items listed in table s9 were found in our samples such as polypropylene and polyethylene more detailed sampling will be necessary to assess the degree to which these litter and debris items contribute to microplastic abundance in urban waters microfibers made up the highest proportion 41 of categories in stormwater samples studies of surface waters within urban areas generally find fibers to be the predominant category 88 fibers luo et al 2019 70 fibers baldwin et al 2016 100 fibers dris et al 2015 89 fibers leslie et al 2017 53 96 fibers wang et al 2017 70 fibers su et al 2016 there are many avenues in which microfibers could be making their way into the streams including the shedding of clothing textiles litter debris and building materials carr 2017 an additional source may be microfibers from sewage sludge since a large portion of the watershed upstream of the humber river and etobicoke creek samples are agricultural 43 and 29 where nasm was applied total road length and end of life vehicle yards were also significantly and positively correlated to particle concentrations indicating that the more roads there are the greater the concentration of anthropogenic particles this is evidenced by the stormwater samples that had black particles in them which we believe to be tire and road wear particles trwp trwps are generated from the use of tires over time and particles from the road surface e g crack sealer generated by frictional wear kreider et al 2010 panko et al 2019 most of them could not be identified due to raman spectroscopy limitations with black particles of the few that could be identified two were found to be vine black or carbon with raman while one was identified with ftir as copolymer ethylene vinyl acetate eva rubber carbon black is used as a filler to car tires adding strength and longevity and makes up 20 35 of a general passenger car tire by weight koenig 1999 wagner et al 2018 eva rubber is used in many applications and so the source is unclear phs 2015 of the particles that could not be identified via spectroscopy they are assumed to be from tires based on their rubber like texture and elongated sausage like shape kreider et al 2010 dannis 1974 though they could be a mixture of trwp we found the most black particles in the etobicoke creek samples 65 compared to humber with 19 and don with 8 which as mentioned earlier had the greatest amount of manufacturing industry but is also home to the toronto pearson international airport that services 1 100 planes per day airports authority 2019 kole et al 2017 4 4 relationships between anthropogenic particles from source waters and lake ontario surface waters nearshore lake ontario waters adjacent to the gta receive microplastics and other anthropogenic particles from the dominant pathways of wastewater effluent and stormwater runoff however based on our nmds results fig 5 the stormwater runoff and wastewater effluent did not group with lake samples suggesting that particle fate processes can rapidly alter the character of microplastics present in the system especially in surface water where these samples were collected sediments clearly are a repository of microplastics entering the lake ontario system ballent et al 2016 corcoran et al 2015 as stormwater runoff carrying a range of particle and chemistry types at high energy enters the system and flow energy drops the characteristics of the particle load will change with more dense or biofouled plastics settling more buoyant particles e g those with lower densities and lower surface area to volume ratios less surface for fouling relative to volume density will tend to stay at the surface where our samples were collected kooi et al 2018 similarly municipal wastewater effluent is discharged near the lake bottom through diffusers particles such as fibers with relatively high surface area to volume ratios and polymers with densities just above 1 g cm 3 polyamide and 1 2 2 3 g cm 3 polyester hidalgo ruz et al 2012 are more likely to remain in the water column or deposit to sediment then rise to the surface altering the particle distribution observed when sampling at the surface although collected at different times samples taken from the plume of wwtp b in the lake had lower particle numbers 0 5 particles l 1 compared to wwtp b plant effluent 27 9 particles l 1 due to dilution and the percentage of fibers were also lower in the plume compared to the effluent 5 conclusions urban areas were found to contribute significant amounts of microplastics and other anthropogenic particle contamination to lake ontario tire wear and or asphalt sealant particles coming from roadways as well as fibers from a variety of sources are entering lake ontario via stormwater and treated wastewater effluent although we did find relationships with our regression analyses this work was exploratory given our limited overall sample size n 18 n 3 for each location sampled and spatial coverage 3 sites per sample type we recommend future studies with a higher resolution of spatial and temporal coverage to mitigate microplastics and anthropogenic particles entering the environment decision makers may begin by working to better understand and prevent these sources in particular point sources like plastic manufacturing industries should be considered in future monitoring efforts nonpoint sources amongst urban areas are more difficult to monitor however there exist some solutions to mitigating particle releases such as permeable pavements or bioretention cells on or near roadways that can be put in place to trap particles before they enter a river or lake kole et al 2017 gilbreath et al 2019 in addition educational programs that work to prevent littering can be implemented a great example of an educational initiative is operation clean sweep by the american chemistry council 2019 working to educate companies about limiting any plastics releases to the environment finally in wastewater effluent we found mostly fibers which can be prevented from entering wastewater treatment plants mcilwraith et al 2019 tested two microfiber capturing technologies in washing machines and found that both reduce microfibers in effluents the results of this study can be used to inform local policy by using scientific data to guide best management practices and future mitigation strategies funding this work was funded in part by environment and climate change canada and a

18046,the sources of microplastics and other anthropogenic particles in freshwater are not well understood the greater toronto area canada s most populous urban area offers a great study area for understanding the sources and pathways for microplastics to enter freshwater ecosystems here we quantified and characterized microplastics and other anthropogenic particles from lake ontario surface waters and source waters including stormwater runoff agricultural runoff and treated wastewater effluent to better understand sources to the great lakes anthropogenic particle concentrations in lake samples were 0 8 particles l 1 in source waters average concentrations were relatively higher in stormwater and wastewater with 15 4 particles l 1 and 13 3 particles l 1 respectively compared to 0 9 particles l 1 on average in agricultural runoff source waters revealed distinct signatures related to the morphologies of anthropogenic particles e g fibers in wastewater in addition many upstream watershed characteristics were found to be significant predictors of anthropogenic particle concentration proximity to urban areas were positively correlated to anthropogenic particle concentrations future studies should focus on local source apportionment to inform management and prevent further contamination of microplastics to freshwater ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic great lakes source apportionment runoff wastewater 1 introduction microplastics plastic particles 5 mm in size have been found in freshwater bodies across the world including on shorelines of lakes and rivers benthic sediments and surface waters eerkes medrano et al 2015 horton et al 2017 reported concentrations range from 0 00017 microplastics per liter mp l 1 in lake huron in the laurentian great lakes to 100 mp l 1 in the surface waters of canals in amsterdam leslie et al 2017 relative to the oceans there have been less studies sampling freshwater ecosystems blettler et al 2018 moreover methods of sampling particle sizes included and reporting units are generally inconsistent making it difficult to compare across locations hidalgo ruz et al 2012 dris et al 2018 still based on the current body of literature microplastic concentrations in surface waters have been found to be comparable and sometimes even higher in freshwater systems compared to marine see table s1 microplastics found in freshwater bodies can contaminate wildlife including sportfish silva cavalcanti et al 2017 and birds brookson et al 2019 they have also been found to contaminate natural resources such as drinking water pivokonsky et al 2018 drawn from freshwater ecosystems concern has been raised about effects of microplastics to humans based on research showing exposure wright and kelly 2017 rist et al 2018 see table s1 in cox et al 2019 and effects to aquatic biota rochman et al 2016 foley et al 2018 and small mammals deng et al 2017 therefore understanding the source of microplastics to the environment is of critical importance as it can inform mitigation to prevent future contamination and minimize the likelihood of further effects the most practical means to mitigate contamination and avoid any resulting harm is to know where the pollutant originates and cut it off at its source sources of microplastics include broken down litter microbeads in personal care products losses from plastic manufacturing and recycling wear from textiles and tires among others barnes et al 2009 lechner et al 2014 lechner and ramler 2015 dris et al 2016 duis and coors 2016

cellulosic microfibers in lake ontario surface waters and its source waters agricultural runoff stormwater runoff and wastewater effluent we set out to determine whether 1 concentrations of microplastics and other anthropogenic particles in lake ontario and nearby rivers vary by upstream watershed characteristics 2 the diversity of particle types vary by source waters and 3 the background microplastic signal in lake ontario aligns with a specific type of source water the motivation for our work stems from the presence of microplastics in the great lakes and policy

great lakes is situated at the end of the great lakes watershed feeding directly into the st lawrence river leading to the atlantic ocean lake ontario straddles canada and the united states and on the canadian side has 104 subwatersheds draining into it with an area of 38 472 km2 located along lake ontario s shores in the northwest is the greater toronto area gta home to canada s largest urban area with a population of 6 3 million residents city of toronto 2019 agriculture is also prevalent in the upper portions of the watersheds that contain the gta with 19 266 farms providing 12 billion cad to canada s economy fao 2019 sampling of wwtp effluent urban stormwater runoff and agricultural runoff was conducted to obtain information on microplastic and other anthropogenic particle abundance and character providing source information lake waters adjacent to toronto which receive river and wastewaters were also sampled for comparison fig 1 all samples were collected between july 28th and october 14th 2015 2 2 sample collection final wwtp effluent was collected from three treatment plants in the region referred to as wwtp a wwtp b and wwtp c three 24 h composites 4 l volume were sampled on three separate days from each plant using automated isco 6712 samplers to collect 167 ml each hour urban stormwater runoff samples were collected from three urban rivers etobicoke creek humber river and don river and the agricultural watershed samples were collected from three small streams downstream of agricultural areas elgin west bruce creek and little rouge stormwater and agricultural runoff samples 4 l each were collected in triplicate during wet weather over the course of one day using a stainless steel bucket with polypropylene rope from a bridge and transferred to an amber glass winchester bottle lake water samples consisted of 10 l grab samples taken from four sites in lake ontario off toronto one in the plume of the humber river one in the plume of wwtp b one in humber bay and one in toronto harbour near the mouth of the don river keating channel three replicates were collected at each lake site using the stainless steel bucket off the side of a monitoring vessel and transferred to clean polyethylene bags in a plastic bucket for all sampling events one field blank was sampled from one location for each of the four types of samples to account for any procedural contamination field blanks were sampled in an identical fashion to the samples but with reverse osmosis ro water from the laboratory all sample bottles were washed with soap and water and triple rinsed with ro water prior to sampling the stainless steel bucket was rinsed three times with site water prior to sampling to prevent cross contamination samples were taken back to the ministry of the environment conservation and parks laboratory for processing while quantification and characterization occurred at the university of toronto 2 3 sample processing and analysis upon return to the laboratory all samples were filtered through a 10 μm polycarbonate filter 142 mm diameter emd millipore isopore via a stainless steel filter holder millipore sigma and stored sealed in a clean glass petri dish the filtrate was collected and the water volume was measured using a graduated cylinder and recorded for every set of 10 samples filtered a laboratory blank with ro water was included to account for any procedural contamination in the laboratory samples and blanks were subjected to further clean up via a density separation technique each large sample filter was placed into a clean glass jar with a plastic lid containing 550 ml of ro water then agitated in an ultrasonic bath fisher scientific m series 120v for 1 2 h the filter was then removed and rinsed and the remaining water with the sample particles was sieved down to 25 μm and transferred to a clean glass separatory funnel with 170 ml of filtered saturated calcium chloride solution cacl2 ρ 1 4 g l the funnel was shaken for 20 s then left for 1 3 days to allow for adequate separation if during separation substantial material was observed sticking to the side of the glass funnel the bottom of the sample was released on the second day shaken for 20 s and left for another day to separate after separation the dense material in the bottom of the funnel was released and discarded the remaining sample was then separated into two size fractions 25 125 μm and 125 μm by stacking a 125 μm sieve on top of a 25 μm one and pouring the solution through those making sure to have a collection pan to catch the cacl2 for proper disposal each size fraction was then filtered onto individual 10 μm polycarbonate filters 47 mm diameter and stored in a clean glass petri dish the 125 μm size fraction was evaluated for this study particle counting and characterization by shape and color was completed with a stereomicroscope first with a black background to look for clear white particles and then with a white background for colored particles all personnel were trained in the same manner and the first three samples completed were evaluated by the trainer for inconsistencies counting guides shaw institute n d examples from publications helm 2017 and past sample sets were all used for training particles were grouped into twelve shape categories foam fiber fiber bundle fragment commercial fragment film pellet sphere paint tire road wear sud soap like hard fragments that fell apart when probed but were chemically identified to be of anthropogenic origin and gel they were also grouped by basic colors e g red yellow silver gold multi colored and an additional category of clear blue due to the existence of numerous clear fibers with blue patches all particles were counted and characterized by color category for measurements of length and width a maximum of 20 particles of each color category combination e g blue fiber were picked manually off the filter due to time constraints with forceps and placed onto double sided sticky tape to be imaged and measured using imagej software characterization of each picked particle was confirmed by two researchers to check consistency the sum of particles in relevant field and lab blank samples were subtracted by color category to account for contamination a subset of the particles from all samples were chemically identified given the large number of particles counted and time considerations we chose a representative 10 by color category to be chemically identified across all samples except for blanks where all non fibers were identified our final results presented for chemical identification were blank subtracted by color category chemical for all non fibers for fibers this subtraction was not necessary because the fibers in the blank were subtracted first by color category and then the remaining 10 of fibers in the samples were chemically identified the chemical identification was completed using micro raman spectroscopy horiba raman xplora plus for particles unable to be handled with forceps chemical identification with raman was done in labspec6 software using a 785 nm range 50 2000 cm 1 or 532 nm range 50 4000 cm 1 laser with primarily a 100x long working distance microscope objective and occasionally 50x objective with a filter ranging from 0 1 to 100 gratings of 600 or 1200 grooves mm 1 or up to 10 s for acquisition time 2 4 6 8 or 10 number of accumulations a confocal hole diameter of 100 μm or 300 μm and a confocal slit width of 50 or 100 μm when acquiring spectra parameters would be optimized to inhibit poor resolution fluorescence and other issues this results in particles having a different suite of parameters for example the 785 nm would provide a better spectrum for darkly colored particles the spectral library used was biorad knowitall raman spectral library of which certain databases were more extensively used including bio rad sadtler e g polymers monomers basic polymers processing chemicals horiba scientific e g forensic and wiley e g sigma aldrich library of raman spectra for particles able to be handled with forceps attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir bruker alpha ii with a diamond internal reflection element and opus 3d software was used for chemical identification with 24 background and sample scans and a spectral range wavenumber of 400 to 4000 cm 1 the spectrum was matched to built in bruker libraries and the primpke et al 2018 library for both raman and ftir a spectral match generally fell between 80 and 98 with a few exceptions made based on personal judgement chemical confirmation indicated anthropogenic particles were visually identified successfully at an average success rate of 93 across source types when excluding particles not able to be chemically identified and 77 on average across source types assuming those unable to be chemically identified were non anthropogenic 2 4 contamination control several laboratory practices were implemented to avoid contamination of samples with plastic and other anthropogenic material all materials used during extraction and analysis were washed and scrubbed with soap using a seaweed sponge vwr natural wool sponge 470001 406 rinsed three times with tap water followed by three times with ro water and dried in an oven or wiped with a kimwipe then blown with air to rid of kimwipe fibers laboratory air was cleaned using a hepa air purifier alen breathesmart fit50 benches cleaned daily and cotton lab coats worn by those extracting and counting particles samples were kept covered to prevent contamination from the air plastic use was minimized or accounted for via lab and field blanks as noted above 2 5 data analysis we used nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds to examine patterns of assemblage structure of microplastics i e by category color category and polymer type among sources and with microplastics found in the lake we used plastic categories i e shapes plastic category color and polymer types to make separate two dimensional ordinations nmds plots were run using euclidean distances we excluded one wwtp sample from all plots because it was an outlier we used the function metamds in the vegan community ecology package oksanen et al 2008 in r bivariate regressions were conducted using r software to examine whether upstream watershed characteristics influenced the quantity of particles in surface waters we took into account model assumptions including residual normality by examining histograms and qq plots and log transformed all the data the following predictor variables were included watershed traits population density sum of road length plastic industry slope end of life vehicle yards and watershed land cover urban green water agriculture this relationship was also assessed with these same characteristics but within a riparian zone the water quality of rivers can be influenced at the full watershed or riparian zone scale sliva and williams 2001 tran et al 2010 beacon environmental ltd 2012 evaluated studies for buffer zone width that attenuate pollutants from entering waterways and the maximum recommended width was 90 m so to be conservative we chose 100 m predictor variables were chosen based on their likelihood to contribute plastics to the environment data sources for predictors can be found in table s3 with maps of plastic industries in fig s1 population in fig s2 and land cover in fig s3 3 results 3 1 anthropogenic particles in source waters the average concentrations stdev of microplastics and other anthropogenic particles per sample type are 13 3 15 5 particles l 1 in wastewater effluent 0 9 1 3 particles l 1 in agricultural runoff 15 4 7 9 particles l 1 in stormwater runoff and 0 8 0 7 particles l 1 in the lake fig 2 see tables s4 and s5 for values on average the particle lengths and widths are 1 2 1 0 mm and 0 07 0 1 mm in wastewater effluent 0 5 0 5 mm and 0 2 0 2 mm in agricultural runoff 0 9 0 9 mm and 0 2 0 2 mm in stormwater runoff and 1 0 0 9 mm and 0 3 0 2 mm in the lake respectively for more information on lengths and widths see figs s4 s5 table s6 particle categories are shown in fig 3 for each watershed type fibers are the dominant category in wastewater treatment plant effluent 90 relative abundance and to a lesser extent in stormwater runoff 41 tire and road wear particles made up 22 of particles in stormwater and were not found in other sample types categories in agricultural runoff and lake samples are diverse with no overwhelmingly dominating category colors of the particles are summarized for each sample type in fig s6 the dominant color for agriculture stormwater and lake samples is clear white accounting for half while wastewater effluent is more mixed with 32 blue 24 clear white 13 clear blue and various colors remaining detailed results by sample type and location are provided in figs s7 s18 of the supporting information the chemical identification of the anthropogenic particles is shown in fig 4 wastewater effluent and lake samples have less diversity of chemical types then agriculture and stormwater runoff 3 2 relationships among sample types the nmds plots yielded a pattern whereby sources stormwater wastewater and agricultural runoff grouped when run with anthropogenic particles grouped by categories 2d stress 0 004 fig 5 a and color category 2d stress 0 05 fig 5b when particles were grouped by chemical identification groupings are not existent 2d stress 0 13 fig 5c for categories and color category where groupings by source are apparent the anthropogenic particle assemblages in surface waters from the lake group most with agriculture followed by stormwater fig 5a and b 3 3 relationships with watershed characteristics at the upstream watershed scale eight of the nine predictor variables had statistically significant bivariate relationships with mean particle l 1 table s7 although plastic industry had the highest explained variation with 79 there were no plastic industries upstream of agricultural watersheds and so the graph lacks data between the two extremes along the x axis see fig 6 bottom right suggesting the results should be taken with caution the predictors indicative of urbanized areas like population density and urban percent have the next highest explained variation fig 6 detailed results for the riparian zone and particle concentration regression models can be found in the supporting information table s8 overall there are little differences between these and the upstream watershed regressions 4 discussion overall we found microplastics and other anthropogenic particles in all sample types and across all locations we found that the characteristics of particles associated with different source waters was unique for wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent and stormwater runoff wwtp effluent was dominated by fibers whereby stormwater runoff had the unique component of black rubbery particles that resembled tire and road wear particles we also found that concentrations of microplastics and other anthropogenic particles in lake ontario streams were correlated with urbanization in the region 4 1 wastewater effluent our results demonstrate that wwtp effluent is a key pathway for microplastics and other anthropogenic particles to enter lake ontario the average concentration of anthropogenic particles in wastewater effluent 13 3 15 5 particles l 1 is higher than concentrations found in nine of eleven studies see table s2 however further sampling should be done to determine a more precise estimate as our study showed a high variability amongst replicates e g as low as 0 3 particles l 1 and as high as 4 4 particles l 1 in wwtp a and had a small sample set microfibers comprised 90 on average of the particles released through wastewater effluent other studies have also found fibers to be the predominant category type in wastewater effluent browne et al 2011 mason et al 2016 prata 2018 the make up of the fiber colors in wastewater effluent in this study are blue clear blue and blue make up 50 clear white make up 25 and dark black and grey make up 16 fig s19 most of the blue fibers were chemically identified as indigo indigo carmine or cellulose 87 one source of these fibers to waste water is from the washing of blue denim jeans mcqueen et al 2017 denim jeans are made of cotton one type of cellulosic material textile dyed with indigo to make blue denim wolf 2011 the remaining fibers were a mix of cellulose polyester and other synthetic fibers e g polyurethane a material used in spandex roughly half of the fibers found were not identified as a polymer type because dyes masked the underlying chemical composition of the fiber fig s20 a significant source of these fibers to wastewater is the washing of garments and other textiles boucher and friot 2017 yang et al 2019 other potential sources are materials flushed down toilets such as wet wipes and feminine hygiene products that may contain plastics like polyester munoz et al 2018 additionally the treatment plants sampled receive sewer overflows water from urban runoff during high flows and so direct littering of textiles or fiber shedding into the atmosphere that has settled into the system can also be sources amongst the remaining non fiber particles we found sixteen gel particles in effluent from wwtp a and b the subset of these that were chemically identified were all silicone polymers one silicone particle was also found in the don river downstream of wwtp c other studies have found silicone in surface water hendrickson et al 2018 fish biginagwa et al 2016 and sediment ballent et al 2016 silicone polymers are made up of a silicone oxygen backbone and not a carbon backbone like the classical petro based polymers some typical applications of them include breast implants cookware hair conditioners and more verschoor et al 2016 ballent et al 2016 identified silicone in lake ontario sediments noting that silicone is among the polymeric materials produced in canada ciac 2014 and suggesting that silicone polymers also settle in lake ontario sediment we find here that wastewater effluent is a pathway to which these polymers enter the watershed however there are likely additional pathways given the multiple sources discussed 4 2 agricultural runoff agricultural runoff had the lowest concentration of anthropogenic particles compared to the other source types of those anthropogenic particles that were found they cannot be fully attributed to agricultural uses as the upstream watersheds were not entirely made up of agricultural fields elgin west had 63 agricultural land and 20 urban area bruce creek had 46 agricultural and 27 urban area and little rouge had 65 agricultural and 18 urban area the use of plastic materials for agricultural practices termed plasticulture is a potential source of microplastics from agricultural fields rochman 2018 for example irrigation is employed in ontario statistics canada 2016 omafra 2019a and a commonly used polymer for irrigation pipes is pvc and ldpe hdpe andrady 2003 which we did find in our samples another example are greenhouse films made from pe or eva copolymers andrady 2003 both polymers were present in the little rouge samples and greenhouses were present upstream based on the land cover data there are many applications of plastic in agriculture e g nursery pots tile drainage and a diversity of chemical types as well so detailed sampling would need to be done to confirm and assess the contribution of each to microplastics abundance sewage sludge is applied to agricultural fields in ontario omafra 2019b and found from other studies to be a major sink for microplastics from wastewater effluent with 95 being diverted from the final effluent murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017 however based on spatial data of non agricultural source material nasm from 2019 which includes sewage sludge omafra 2019b the agricultural watersheds sampled in this study did not have sewage sludge applied to them and so may not be a source of microplastics in our samples 4 3 urban stormwater runoff urban areas are significant hotspots for microplastics baldwin et al 2016 hitchcock and mitrovic 2019 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2017 and our study illustrates that urban centers are important contributors of microplastics to lake ontario from our samples the diversity of chemical types in stormwater runoff fig 4 suggests a high diversity of sources including plastic industries littering roads and wastewater effluent although it is not fully clear the contribution of plastic manufacturing industry to microplastic abundance in the watersheds sampled it is still a source that should be considered a considerable number of plastic manufacturing and recycling industries are located in southern ontario ballent et al 2016 this study figs s1 and s2 and of all provinces and territories ontario has the largest gdp for plastics and rubber manufacturing innovation science and economic development canada 2017 2018 microplastic particles with characteristics consistent with manufacturing and recycling processes flash trimmings are indicated to be present in toronto area waters and sediments helm 2017 ballent et al 2016 in other studies on the great lakes commercial fragments and pellets have been found in environmental samples ballent et al 2016 corcoran et al 2015 helm 2017 zbyszewski et al 2014 corcoran et al 2015 found the most common type of microplastics to be pellets at a humber bay beach site due to the low volumes sampled we did not collect any pellets and found only a small number of fragments indicated to be generated from commercial activities 1 it is thus less clear whether there are specific chemical types or categories that can be linked back to the industrial sources the commercial fragments were found in etobicoke creek and chemically identified as polyethylene and polyethylene methacrylate suggesting that any manufacturers producing these polymers could be spilling these plastics into the watershed this watershed has the largest number of plastic manufacturing industries approximately 56 of all watersheds in lake ontario litter materials intentionally discarded to the environment and debris materials lost by wind from properties recycling etc are sources of anthropogenic materials to the environment that is more prevalent in urban areas litter could not be included in regression models due to lack of data on the distribution of litter debris across watersheds however based on shoreline clean up data from the gta table s9 litter and debris are likely contributors to the abundance of microplastics as these materials break up in the environment the top item found is often cigarette butts made with cellulose acetate and we did find cellulose acetate in the stormwater samples all other polymeric chemicals that make up the debris items listed in table s9 were found in our samples such as polypropylene and polyethylene more detailed sampling will be necessary to assess the degree to which these litter and debris items contribute to microplastic abundance in urban waters microfibers made up the highest proportion 41 of categories in stormwater samples studies of surface waters within urban areas generally find fibers to be the predominant category 88 fibers luo et al 2019 70 fibers baldwin et al 2016 100 fibers dris et al 2015 89 fibers leslie et al 2017 53 96 fibers wang et al 2017 70 fibers su et al 2016 there are many avenues in which microfibers could be making their way into the streams including the shedding of clothing textiles litter debris and building materials carr 2017 an additional source may be microfibers from sewage sludge since a large portion of the watershed upstream of the humber river and etobicoke creek samples are agricultural 43 and 29 where nasm was applied total road length and end of life vehicle yards were also significantly and positively correlated to particle concentrations indicating that the more roads there are the greater the concentration of anthropogenic particles this is evidenced by the stormwater samples that had black particles in them which we believe to be tire and road wear particles trwp trwps are generated from the use of tires over time and particles from the road surface e g crack sealer generated by frictional wear kreider et al 2010 panko et al 2019 most of them could not be identified due to raman spectroscopy limitations with black particles of the few that could be identified two were found to be vine black or carbon with raman while one was identified with ftir as copolymer ethylene vinyl acetate eva rubber carbon black is used as a filler to car tires adding strength and longevity and makes up 20 35 of a general passenger car tire by weight koenig 1999 wagner et al 2018 eva rubber is used in many applications and so the source is unclear phs 2015 of the particles that could not be identified via spectroscopy they are assumed to be from tires based on their rubber like texture and elongated sausage like shape kreider et al 2010 dannis 1974 though they could be a mixture of trwp we found the most black particles in the etobicoke creek samples 65 compared to humber with 19 and don with 8 which as mentioned earlier had the greatest amount of manufacturing industry but is also home to the toronto pearson international airport that services 1 100 planes per day airports authority 2019 kole et al 2017 4 4 relationships between anthropogenic particles from source waters and lake ontario surface waters nearshore lake ontario waters adjacent to the gta receive microplastics and other anthropogenic particles from the dominant pathways of wastewater effluent and stormwater runoff however based on our nmds results fig 5 the stormwater runoff and wastewater effluent did not group with lake samples suggesting that particle fate processes can rapidly alter the character of microplastics present in the system especially in surface water where these samples were collected sediments clearly are a repository of microplastics entering the lake ontario system ballent et al 2016 corcoran et al 2015 as stormwater runoff carrying a range of particle and chemistry types at high energy enters the system and flow energy drops the characteristics of the particle load will change with more dense or biofouled plastics settling more buoyant particles e g those with lower densities and lower surface area to volume ratios less surface for fouling relative to volume density will tend to stay at the surface where our samples were collected kooi et al 2018 similarly municipal wastewater effluent is discharged near the lake bottom through diffusers particles such as fibers with relatively high surface area to volume ratios and polymers with densities just above 1 g cm 3 polyamide and 1 2 2 3 g cm 3 polyester hidalgo ruz et al 2012 are more likely to remain in the water column or deposit to sediment then rise to the surface altering the particle distribution observed when sampling at the surface although collected at different times samples taken from the plume of wwtp b in the lake had lower particle numbers 0 5 particles l 1 compared to wwtp b plant effluent 27 9 particles l 1 due to dilution and the percentage of fibers were also lower in the plume compared to the effluent 5 conclusions urban areas were found to contribute significant amounts of microplastics and other anthropogenic particle contamination to lake ontario tire wear and or asphalt sealant particles coming from roadways as well as fibers from a variety of sources are entering lake ontario via stormwater and treated wastewater effluent although we did find relationships with our regression analyses this work was exploratory given our limited overall sample size n 18 n 3 for each location sampled and spatial coverage 3 sites per sample type we recommend future studies with a higher resolution of spatial and temporal coverage to mitigate microplastics and anthropogenic particles entering the environment decision makers may begin by working to better understand and prevent these sources in particular point sources like plastic manufacturing industries should be considered in future monitoring efforts nonpoint sources amongst urban areas are more difficult to monitor however there exist some solutions to mitigating particle releases such as permeable pavements or bioretention cells on or near roadways that can be put in place to trap particles before they enter a river or lake kole et al 2017 gilbreath et al 2019 in addition educational programs that work to prevent littering can be implemented a great example of an educational initiative is operation clean sweep by the american chemistry council 2019 working to educate companies about limiting any plastics releases to the environment finally in wastewater effluent we found mostly fibers which can be prevented from entering wastewater treatment plants mcilwraith et al 2019 tested two microfiber capturing technologies in washing machines and found that both reduce microfibers in effluents the results of this study can be used to inform local policy by using scientific data to guide best management practices and future mitigation strategies funding this work was funded in part by environment and climate change canada and a

18047,microorganism derived dissolved organic nitrogen mdon represents a significant and inevitable portion of dissolved organic nitrogen don in the wastewater biotreatment processes in the existing method mdon concentrations are indirectly measured by the values of don concentrations from the reactors with don free influent however this becomes problematic when influent contains don especially when the real wastewater is involved the paucity of the direct methods to quantitatively measure mdon is a major barrier to further research this limitation is due to the difficulty of segregating mdon from the other nitrogenous organics e g influent don in this study we propose the asm mdon model based on asm 1 which incorporates the production and consumption of mdon in the activated sludge processes to predict the mdon concentrations in four independent lab scale tests our model was established and calibrated to obtain the accurate values of mdon r2 0 929 p 0 05 and the validity and applicability of the model were successfully examined by comparing the simulated and measured data moreover the universality of the asm mdon model was further confirmed by simulating mdon production in a full scale wastewater treatment plant a reasonable prediction of mdon formation was shown in a full scale test 1 98 0 71 mg l in june and 1 51 0 54 mg l in july and is indirectly supported by an algal bioassay p 0 05 t test this study provides a useful approach to the efficient and accurate evaluation of mdon formation which will improve current strategies designed to minimize the effluent mdon in wastewater bioprocesses graphical abstract image 1 keywords mathematical model dissolved organic nitrogen microbial products activated sludge systems wastewater treatment 1 introduction the reduction of effluent inorganic nitrogen in wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been successfully achieved by the upgrading of wastewater treatment technologies such as the retrofitting of conventional bioprocess to biological nutrient removal process eom et al 2017 however dissolved organic nitrogen don remains unimproved resulting in an increase in the proportion of don in effluent nitrogen pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 simsek et al 2016 therefore the removal of don is a future objective needed to comply with the requirements of a tightened stringency of nitrogen discharge regulations hendriks and langeveld 2017 simsek et al 2012 furthermore the interest in don in recent studies is growing due to its close relationship with the membrane fouling xu et al 2010 in wastewater treatment and the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts in drinking water treatment pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 the activated sludge as process is the most common biological wastewater treatment technology for nutrient removal in wwtps effluent don of the as system mainly includes two groups based on the source of its production pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 hu et al 2018 influent derived nitrogenous compounds influent derived don idon that are linked to the components of the influent and are recalcitrant to the biotreatment such as natural nitrogenous organics and trace nitrogenous organics and microorganism derived nitrogenous compounds microorganism derived don mdon which are generated from microbial metabolism in the biological treatment processes such as soluble microbial products smp a recent study on molecular characteristics of mdon emphasized the ability of the as system effluent containing mdon to stimulate algal growth hu et al 2019 additionally since mdon is originated from the biomass growth and decay during the biotreatment processes mdon is inevitable and more tightly than idon associated with operational parameters and engineering conditions pertaining to the microorganisms sattayatewa et al 2009 thus reducing the formation of mdon in the as system is desirable to facilitate strict nitrogen discharge and to protect the receiving waters however the information on mdon removal in wwtps is considerably limited a key barrier to characterizing and regulating the production of mdon is a dilemma pertaining to the quantification of mdon in the real wastewaters existing methods can not directly determine the concentration of mdon the challenge of distinguishing the concentrations of mdon and idon can hardly be addressed through conventional chemical analysis pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 ni et al 2012 xie et al 2016 thus an appropriate technical option needs to be established for mdon determination a comprehensive mathematical model combined with experimental validations can be a powerful tool for the measurement of mdon currently several different models have been developed to quantitatively and qualitatively simulate and predict don concentrations during biological wastewater treatments makinia et al 2011 simsek et al 2012 simsek 2016 bareha et al 2019 these models allow quantification of don concentrations and the quality of predictions is evaluated by experiments makinia et al 2011 modified the activated sludge model asm 2d by differentiating the type of organic nitrogen in the mechanism later the modified mechanism was combined with an internal model of the biowin software to predict the changes in don at varied solids retention times srt and model don concentration in various full scale wwtps simsek et al 2012 2013 2016 these studies provide valuable insight into the transformation of don in real wwtps however none of these studies take into account the role of mdon in bioprocesses mdon is included in don instead of being considered as a separate state variable there is an urgent need to develop a mathematical model to evaluate the formation of mdon during the as processes in practice smp which contains an overlapping portion with mdon westgate and park 2010 has been included and characterized in a series of asms and their modifications ni et al 2009 fenu et al 2010 ni and yu 2011 these smp models describe the production kinetics of different types of smp and provide fundamental information on the factors impacting effluent smp ni et al 2012 xie et al 2016 therefore from a capability perspective the mdon model can be established and implemented in the design and operation of wwtps this work aimed to fill the knowledge gap with regard to quantification of mdon in the as system and to develop an asm based model describing the mdon production kinetics defined as asm mdon model we carried out two different lab scale batch tests to develop and calibrate the asm mdon model and two additional sets of tests on various operational conditions to demonstrate the model application to further assess the universality of the asm mdon model in the full scale wwtps mdon formation in the as process was sufficiently predicted in a municipal wwtp furthermore the reliability of the full scale test was indirectly validated by comparing the predicted results and the data from an algal growth bioassay 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of reactors the laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors sbr were used to cultivate the as and were composed of two parallel identical parent reactors both sbrs had a working volume of 2 l with a 12 h cycle of mixing 6 h aeration 4 h settling 2 h and decanting sun et al 2017 the srt of the reactors was set at 20 d by discarding the as from the reactors and the hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 24 h jarusutthirak and amy 2007 hu et al 2019 the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of the two sbrs was approximately 3000 mg l the seed sludge was collected from a municipal wwtp in nanjing china and washed by milliq water three times prior to inoculum the reactors were operated at room temperature 23 2 c and with dissolved oxygen do of approximately 4 0 mg l during the aeration phase the sbrs were fed with synthetic wastewater as described in a previous study liao et al 2019 which was maintained at ph 7 by dosing 1 mol l hcl or 1 mol l naoh the composition of the influent is described in detail in tables s1 and s2 with chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus of 300 mg l 20 mg l and 3 5 mg l respectively the batch tests of the model were carried out when the sbrs were operated for at least three srts and reached the constant effluent quality ni et al 2009 2 2 batch tests to establish and verify the asm mdon model four independent sets of batch tests were carried out by using the sludge from the sbrs to provide the experimental data for the model calibration validation and application the sludge was inoculated in a 1 l beaker after washing three times with milliq water all batch reactors were operated by the cycle of filling 2 min mixing and aeration 300 min settling 48 min and wasting 10 min driven by the peristaltic pumps the comparison of the influent compositions of tests 1 4 is expanded in table s3 in the first batch test test 1 the influent compositions were the same as the parent reactors the initial ammonia concentration of 20 mg l and mlss concentration of 3000 mg l were maintained in test 1 compared to test 1 the second batch test test 2 was carried out under a different conditions of 30 mg ammonia l and 2000 mg mlss l it is needed to set test 2 under a different operational condition comparing to test 1 thus test 2 was carried out at a higher loading than that in test 1 and was at a higher initial tn concentration and a lower mlss concentration two series of batch reactors test 3 and test 4 were used to test the ability of the new model to simulate and predict mdon formation under various conditions these two tests had the same operation as test 1 and test 2 nevertheless test 3 was carried out in three batch reactors with a gradient of the initial ammonia concentrations 10 20 and 30 mg l and test 4 was operated in three batch reactors with a gradient of mlss 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l the mdon production data from test 3 and 4 were compared with the results simulated by the new model under the same conditions samples were collected every 20 30 min and filtered through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membranes for the analysis of cod tn ammonia nitrate nitrite and don makinia et al 2011 czerwionka et al 2012 the don concentration was calculated by subtracting the concentrations of ammonia nitrate and nitrite from tn saunders et al 2017 every indicator in the four tests was measured in duplicate or triplicate and the average values were input in the model and reported in this study 2 3 description of the full scale wwtp to further explore the applicability of the asm mdon model and the necessity of the modification a full scale test of a wwtp with an oxidation ditch system was carried out grab samples were collected from dc municipal wwtps nanjing china in may july 2019 the primary effluent and the secondary effluent were taken from the primary settling tank and the secondary settling tank respectively the as were obtained from the bioprocess oxidation ditch the dc municipal wwtp on average has a wastewater flow of 300 000 m3 day wastewater the plant primarily treats the domestic wastewater through a carrousel oxidation ditch coagulation rotary disc filter and ultraviolet processes the mlss hrt and srt of the carrousel oxidation ditch were 4000 mg l 18 3 h and 18 1 d respectively the samples were immediately sealed at 4 c before sample analysis all samples were treated and the same indicators were measured as the mentioned batch tests 2 4 algal growth bioassay to assess the potential of don in oxidation ditch effluents to stimulate algal growth a 14 day algal growth bioassay was carried out liu et al 2011 the filtered samples were pretreated by an ion exchange resin dowex 1 8 resin in chloride form sigma aldrich usa selenastrum capricornutum 1 5 ml obtained from fachb collection chinese academy of sciences and mixed culture bacteria 1 0 ml collected from municipal wwtps were selected as the inoculum in the bioassay a nitrate free sample 100 ml which was obtained after ion exchange was mixed with the inoculum in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask the details have been described in the study of liu et al 2011 briefly the bioavailability bioavailable don don can be calculated as a change in don before and after the inoculation 2 5 analytical methods cod tn ammonia nitrate and nitrite were determined by a commercial cod kit hach usa by second derivative uv salicylate second derivative uv and diazotization methods respectively persulfate digestion was performed before tn assay mlss was measured by standard methods epa of china 2002 ph and temperature were determined by an advanced electrochemistry meter orion versa star thermo usa do concentration was measured using an oxygen meter sg6 mettler toledo usa 3 model construction 3 1 conceptual model descriptions a modified model was developed to explore the kinetics of mdon formed in the as system the asm mdon model incorporates seven components and five processes three particulate components include heterotrophic bacteria autotrophic bacteria and inert organic matter four soluble components include mdon nitrate ammonia and do the components are represented as follows xh heterotrophic bacteria xa autotrophic bacteria xi inert organic matter sdon mdon sno nitrite snh ammonia and so do differentiating from the previous models the asm mdon model sets mdon as a new component and simplifies the relative bioprocesses the model is evolved from the conventional asm with the basic concepts based on the fate of don in biomass parkin and mccarty 1981 makinia et al 2011 1 microorganisms release mdon as the metabolites into the effluent during microbial growth and decay 2 part of released mdon can be reassimilated through ammonification by microorganisms sattayatewa et al 2009 and 3 refractory mdon is not bioavailable and is considered as the residual inert matter the conversions in the asm mdon model are schematically illustrated in fig 1 the asm mdon model is based on asm 1 therefore it refers to microbial utilization through heterotrophs and autotrophs the processes of initial production left side and the remineralization right side of mdon are additionally extended in this study the former processes are involved in paths 1 8 path 1 represents the generation of the energy which is needed in the bioprocesses both path 4 and path 8 are the oxygen utilization path 2 and path 5 represent the growth of heterotrophs and autotrophs on the utilization of ammonia respectively path 3 and path 6 represent the generation of mdon in the metabolism of heterotrophs and autotrophs respectively path 7 is the production of nitrate due to the oxidation of ammonia the latter processes are mainly associated with the ammonification of mdon path 9 the residual organic matter which cannot be reutilized path 10 and 12 and the cell decay with the oxygen consumption path 11 and 13 the rate expressions of all paths are shown in table 1 this approach was used for the pragmatic reasons that the proposed model includes the essential processes of the fate of mdon with simplified the rate expressions 3 2 integrated don formation equations the descriptions of stoichiometric coefficients and kinetic parameters kinetic expressions for the related components and the gujer matrix in the new model are listed in table 2 table s4 and table s5 respectively according to the notation the subscripts h and a represent heterotrophs and autotrophs respectively 3 2 1 kinetics of biomass growth and decay a monod kinetics were used as the fundamental equation in the proposed model the kinetics of heterotrophs and autotrophs can be divided into biomass accumulation first term and loss second term and are described by eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 d x h dt μ ˆ h s n h k h n h s n h s o k h o s o x h b h s o k h o s

h o s o and s o k a o s o are the switched functions for opening or closing the relative kinetics assuming that the endogenous respiration takes place within heterotrophs first term and autotrophs second term the inert nitrogenous matters are accumulated as the refractory metabolites eq 3 3 d x i dt f i b h s o k h o s o x h f i b a s o k a o s o x a 3 2 2 kinetics of ammonia conversion the consumption of ammonia is coupled to the biomass growth and the conversion of mdon to ammonia proceeds by the ammonification of heterotrophic bacteria henze et al 1987 eq 4 defines the conversion of ammonia in the as system 4 d s n h dt f h d o n y h i x b μ ˆ h s n h k h n h s n h s o k h o s o x h f a d o n f n o y a i x b μ ˆ a s n h k a n h s n h s o k a o s o x a k a s d o n k h d o n s d o

formation comparison of simulated and measured data sensitivity analysis parameters estimation and model adjustment fig 2 the asm mdon model was simulated by a software package aquasim according to the manual and tutorial reichert 1998 the experimental data from test 1 were applied for the calibration of the model parameters the developed model ran under the same conditions as that in test 1 to obtain the simulated data preliminary simulation in the preliminary simulation the default values were assigned to the parameters derived from the basic models and the assumed values were used for the new parameters henze et al 1987 1999 gujer et al 1999 a further step will be run if the simulated data do not match the experimental data sensitive parameters to the prediction of mdon concentrations are identified by sensitivity analysis and optimized by parameters estimation a standard deviation of 10 of parameter values are selected in editing the parameters sensitivity analysis combines identifiability analysis and uncertainty analysis reichert 1998 the effects of parameters on variables simulation can be revealed by the absolute relative sensitivity function eq 6 6 δ y p a r p y p where y is variables concentrations and p is the analyzed parameters the uncertainty analysis was calculated to evaluate the contribution of parameters to the simulated values of mdon 95 confidence interval the model uncertainty is attributed to the error propagation of every parameter and the errors of parameters were calculated as the mean square fitting errors ni et al 2015 7 σ y i 1 m y p i 2 σ p i 2 where p i represents the uncertain parameters σ p i represents the standard deviations of parameters y p1 pm represents the solution of the model expression of variables at a given location and time and σ y represents the approximate standard deviation of the model result the error contribution of parameters the contributions of parameter uncertainties to the total uncertainty is given by eq 8 8 δ y p e r r y p σ p during parameter estimation the parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squares of the weight deviations between experimental data and simulated data as shown in eq 9 9 χ 2 p i 1 n y m e a s i y i p δ m e a s i 2 where y m e a s i represents the i th experimental data δ m e a s i represents its standard deviation y i p represents the predicted data from the new model corresponding to the i th experimental data at the time the experiment is taken p p1 pm represents the parameters and n represents the number of data points a goodness of fit criterion r2 0 81 r 0 9 between the experimental data from test 1 and simulated data is used to select the results when the results satisfy the criterion the parameter estimation ends and the model adjustment is complete sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation were performed according to similar procedure in a recent study lu et al 2018 the kinetical parameters and stoichiometry coefficients used in the asm mdon model after the adjustment are summarized in table 2 3 4 model validation application and universality the validation step was carried out in the adjusted model by comparing the simulated data of variables with a separate set of data from test 2 the concentrations of tn and mlss in test 2 tn of 30 mg l and mlss of 2000 mg l are different from those in test 1 tn of 20 mg l and mlss of 3000 mg l the goodness of fit index is calculated between the simulated data and measured data from test 2 similar as the validation step the model application and universality were tested by comparing the simulated data and experimental data under different conditions the data from tests 3 4 were used for the application step additionally the asm mdon model was implemented in a full scale wwtp and a bioassay was used to indirectly confirm the modeling results and the importance of the asm mdon model 4 results and discussion 4 1 mdon formation in the as system the parent sbrs operated for 100 d 5 srt before the batch tests and the stable performance was achieved a sharp reduction in cod and tn concentrations was observed within the first 2 h in test 1 due to the reaction of microorganisms fig s1 cod and tn were not completely depleted in 6 h because the nitrogenous and carbonaceous compounds were excreted during the microbial metabolism the sole focus on the effluent cod and tn may neglect the conversion mechanisms of different forms of nitrogen the new model successfully predicted the variations in ammonia nitrate and mdon concentrations during a single cycle in test 1 fig 3 the predicted concentrations of ammonia were a good fit to the experimental values fig 3 a showing that ammonia decreased from 20 mg l to 5 mg l after approximately 2 h corresponding to the curves of tn and nitrite fig 3 b illustrates the formation of nitrate by the oxidation of ammonia the trends of nitrate production are adequately described after approximately 3 h from the beginning of the cycle a reasonable explanation for slight overestimation of nitrate production at the beginning of a cycle is that the model uses the concept of single step nitrification for simplification henze et al 1987 and incorporates nitrite into the simulated values of nitrate the linear regression between the measured y axis and simulated x axis values of nitrate fig s2 was assessed a strong linear correlation between the measured and simulated values in the initial 3 h was detected and the slope of the line approached 1 y 0 898x r2 0 951 thus we consider that the slight overestimation of nitrate can be ignored model predictions of mdon generated in test 1 accurately matched the experimental values fig 3 c conforming to the result of linear regression analysis between the measured and simulated data of mdon r2 0 929 p 0 05 it should be noted that the predicted errors of mdon are higher than those obtained during the prediction of the concentration of ammonia and nitrite as a part of don mdon data are consistent with previous studies on the measurement of don pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 saunders et al 2017 indicating a slightly high level of errors the indirect measurement method of don inevitably accumulates errors and reduces the precision of calculated values saunders et al 2017 the new model can predict the exact values of mdon but it also has a similar trend of measured error nevertheless the error can be tolerated and the model formulation can capture the production and loss of mdon by microorganisms 4 2 model validation the model validation was evaluated by comparing the simulated data with the experimental data from test 2 fig 4 shows the results of the concentrations of ammonia nitrate and mdon cod and tn are shown in fig s3 the validation experiment was carried out at various levels of the initial influent of 30 mg tn l and 2000 mg mlss l 20 mg tn l and 3000 mg mlss l in test 1 and the simulated indicators adequately matched the measured data compared to test 1 test 2 was operated using higher concentrations of tn and mlss the agreement between the predicted and measured data remains thus the independent experiment provides further evidence that the model is able to capture well the general trends in the transformation of nitrogen under different conditions however the predicted error of mdon concentrations still fluctuated in a wide range the analysis of error contribution can give an explanation on which parameters are the main contributors to the wide range of error in mdon simulation the error contribution of these parameters to the mdon formation is presented in fig s4 showing that f h d o n i x b and k a are the most influential parameters to mdon concentrations and have higher effects on the mdon uncertainty than any of the other 15 parameters therefore we specifically focused on the values of f h d o n i x b and k a based on the sensitivity coefficient which was automatically calculated in aquasim fraction of mdon formation by heterotrophs f h d o n 1 52 ammonification rate i x b 1 46 and the nitrogen in biomass i x b 0 69 were found to be more sensitive to mdon formation the coefficient within the range of significantly influential values thus the sensitive parameters can induce a greater variation of the predicted values under the same conditions versus other non sensitive parameters these results are also consistent with the concepts of the processes in asm mdon model fig 1 in which mdon formation is closely associated with the utilization f h d o n and i x b and recycle k a 4 3 model application under different conditions the model application was carried out to evaluate the capability of model to simulate the mdon concentrations under different conditions figs 5 and 6 show the simulated curves and measured data under different initial concentrations of ammonia and mlss respectively the model performs accurate simulations of the concentrations of mdon ammonia and nitrate the simulated values matched the experimental values from test 3 and test 4 and the changing trends of the mdon concentrations were captured by the new model this indicates that the new model can be applied under the expanded conditions various trends were observed in test 3 the removal efficiency of ammonia was up to 90 in a single cycle the biokinetics trends of ammonia and nitrate were analogous under different nitrogen load conditions from 10 mg l to 30 mg l within 4 h the monotonic variations were observed in ammonia and nitrate concentrations however the trends of mdon values were different the formation of mdon gradually and monotonically increased when the initial concentrations of ammonia were set to 20 and 30 mg l while mdon concentrations initial concentration of 10 mg ammonia l initially raised but then decreased after 4 h and further declined to 63 9 of the plateau value 1 13 mg l at 5 h 0 72 mg l fig 5a c this result can be explained the dominant ammonification of mdon with regard to the nitrogen utilization in microbial metabolism when ammonia was depleted after 4 h the remineralization of mdon and the utilization of ammonia constitute a part of the nitrogen cycle which are incorporated into microorganisms chubukov et al 2014 ammonia in the external substrate is more accessible than mdon which is produced from microorganisms due to this limitation mdon utilization may be repressed under the ammonia replete conditions and can dominate in the ammonia depleted environments similar to these results the oxidation rate of ammonia and the rate of nitrate and mdon formation were enhanced at the elevating concentrations of mlss fig 6 an increase in mlss concentrations from 1000 to 2000 mg l had slightly positive effects on the formation of mdon and strongly influenced the oxidation of ammonia these effects may be due to the efficiency of microbial metabolism in the biomass in the as moreover the addition of as leads to the augment of biomass and promotes metabolism then ammonia is quickly oxidized to nitrate nitrification or assimilated into nitrogenous microbial products simultaneously the batch reactor of 3000 mg mlss l receiving the same amount of the substrate can reach the plateaus more quickly than other reactors the changes of mdon in fig 6 c are also similar to the trends in fig 5 a as shown in both figs 5 a and 6 c the mdon concentrations changed non monotonically the mdon concentrations initially increased to a plateau and subsequently decreased the operational conditions of the test in figs 5 a and 6 c are under a low loading of wastewater that is a low value of nitrogen concentrations per mlss concentrations it is speculated that microorganisms are able to further remineralize mdon after the depletion of ammonia thus for the same reason as shown in fig 5 a the nonmonotonic trends in fig 6 c are attributed to the switching state from ammonia replete to ammonia depleted conditions overall the indicators predicted by the model were in good agreement with the experimental data under different initial conditions the asm mdon model was able to properly depict the variations of effluent quality this prediction may enable engineers to regulate the bioprocesses with preliminarily estimated results to comply with the requirements of effluent nitrogen limits 4 4 model universality and implementation in a full scale wwtp to further evaluate the universality and applicability of asm mdon mdon generation in a full scale wwtp was simulated the samples were collected before without mdon and after with mdon produced in the oxidation ditch the bioprocesses the parameters defined in the equations were adjusted to match the influent characteristics the profiles of three sampling events are presented in table s6 the samples collected in june and july showed unique variations thus we specifically focused the subsequent efforts on these two samples the measured concentrations of don in the oxidation ditch effluents and the estimated values of mdon are presented in fig 7 the measured don in the effluents were within a common range in previous studies pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 chen et al 2011 no significant differences was observed in the concentrations of effluent don in june 3 85 0 26 mg l and july 4 10 0 44 mg l p 0 05 t test n 6 however mdon concentrations in june were significantly higher than those in july 1 98 0 71 mg l in june 1 51 0 54 mg l in july p 0 05 t test n 6 it is interesting to note that while don concentrations in oxidation ditch effluents were comparable within a similar level the differences in the formation of mdon were detected however mdon formed during the real biotreatment process is barely detectable by the direct measurement method it is unclear whether the results herein were reliable or the data simply deviated from the observable levels studies of mdon on the laboratory scale identified that mdon contained a considerable part of nitrogenous organics with the accessibility for microorganisms such as proteins hu et al 2019 moreover mdon is more readily bioavailable than idon and tends to accelerate eutrophication in the receiving waters pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 liao et al 2019 by these deductions an algal bioassay was used as an alternative to assess the reliability of the mdon simulation don bioavailability bioavailable don don is the indicator of the ability of don to promote the algal growth pehlivanoglu and sedlak 2004 simsek et al 2013 we considered the significant components of mdon approaching to bioavailable don if significantly higher don bioavailability and bioavailable don concentrations exist in samples collected in june versus samples collected in july it can be considered as additional evidence supporting our results the bioassay was performed specifically using the oxidation ditch effluent nitrate free samples to compare the impact of the effluents on algal growth don bioavailability of the effluent samples was 68 5 in june and 51 7 in july bioavailable don was 2 62 0 29 mg l in june and 2 09 0 23 mg l in july similarly the bioavailability was significantly different between the samples obtained in june and july p 0 05 t test n 6 suggesting that the effluent sample collected in june is more labile than that obtained in july and may have additional adverse impacts on the receiving wasters furthermore no significant differences between bioavailable don and simulated mdon were detected p 0 05 t test the similarity of these results of mdon simulation indicated that the effluent samples collected in june were more likely to drive eutrophication hence the findings of the full scale test were indirectly confirmed by the relationship between mdon and its bioavailability and by the association of mdon with bioavailable don thus the full scale test with the bioassay revealed that focusing exclusively on the effluent don may be insufficient to characterize the effluent quality and the prediction of mdon could complement the monitoring information moreover the important role of mdon was neglected in previous studies due to the paucity of the quantification method of mdon in full scale wwtps makinia et al 2011 hu et al 2018 hence the development of the asm mdon model with a good universality provides a useful tool to obtain the detailed characteristics of the effluent 4 5 implications the role of mdon in the wwtps may be neglected due to the deficiency of approach to quantify mdon previous research on mdon focused only on the formation and behavior of mdon in the laboratory scale parkin and mccarty 1981 hu et al 2019 liao et al 2019 in these studies the influent to the systems is synthetic wastewater without external don due to the difficulties in segregation of mdon from idon the characteristics of mdon in the biotreatment of the real wastewater are strikingly limited here we report a modified model which can quantify the mdon production in the as processes in the lab and at full scale the fundamental understanding of mdon formation in the wwtps is enhanced by the new model previous studies on the mathematical models have been aware of the importance of organic nitrogen as components in the models makinia et al 2011 simsek 2016 different types of organic nitrogen were added in the models such as particulate organic nitrogen colloid organic nitrogen and biodegradable don makinia et al 2011 none of these included the compound which is only generated by the as microorganisms in the system additionally it is hard to quantify mdon concentrations in the real wastewater the asm mdon model improve this deficiency and incorporate mdon as a separate variable into the model this model can be applied as a complementary tool to assess the effluent quality for example the model may support the estimation of the formation characteristics and removal of mdon in the wwtps in subsequent studies another practical application of the asm mdon model and results of this work can be used to identify the constituents of effluent tn in the real wastewater the formation concentrations of mdon in the as system can be quantified by the new model combining the asm mdon model simulation with the conventional chemical analysis on inorganic nitrogen the detailed information on the concentrations of mdon and inorganic nitrogen can be obtained then the appropriate strategies will be developed in term of the main component of tn the flexible selection and optimization of regulatory strategies can be performed to control nitrogen discharge in terms of whether mdon dominates the effluent nitrogen a proper controlling strategy targeting on the main contributor of effluent tn can decrease the investment in the retrofitting of wastewater treatment technologies thus the asm mdon model can be helpful in the cost efficient control of effluent tn and the improvement of effluent quality however the new model that we proposed has limitations for example some of the simulated values of nitrate were overestimated figs 4 6 the differences between simulated and measured values may be due to the simplification of nitrification processes and the omission of the details ammonia in the influent is undergoing stepwise oxidation by microorganisms to nitrate via nitrification and nitrate which is reduced to nitrogen gas by denitrification yoon et al 2019 moreover both processes can be attributed to the emissions of nitrogen containing gas yoon et al 2019 the generation mechanism of these nitrogenous compounds is complex and includes numerous competing and parallel reactions responsible for the production and consumption of the compound hu et al 2016 thus the nitrification processes are simplified in the models such as asm 1 and model in this study the model proposed in this study can be extended to a nitrogen based model containing more integral processes in further study through a tremendous challenge 5 conclusions in this study the asm mdon model on the formation of mdon in the as system was successfully developed the asm mdon model provides an approach to quantify mdon formation in both lab scale and full scale it can be a useful tool for operational purposes on the wwtps management indeed through the simulation of the asm mdon model the component which dominates the effluent nitrogen can be distinguished and then the corresponding strategy can be applied to regulate the main contributor to the effluent the implementation of a more effective controlling strategy on nitrogen can realize cost efficient management in wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare

18047,microorganism derived dissolved organic nitrogen mdon represents a significant and inevitable portion of dissolved organic nitrogen don in the wastewater biotreatment processes in the existing method mdon concentrations are indirectly measured by the values of don concentrations from the reactors with don free influent however this becomes problematic when influent contains don especially when the real wastewater is involved the paucity of the direct methods to quantitatively measure mdon is a major barrier to further research this limitation is due to the difficulty of segregating mdon from the other nitrogenous organics e g influent don in this study we propose the asm mdon model based on asm 1 which incorporates the production and consumption of mdon in the activated sludge processes to predict the mdon concentrations in four independent lab scale tests our model was established and calibrated to obtain the accurate values of mdon r2 0 929 p 0 05 and the validity and applicability of the model were successfully examined by comparing the simulated and measured data moreover the universality of the asm mdon model was further confirmed by simulating mdon production in a full scale wastewater treatment plant a reasonable prediction of mdon formation was shown in a full scale test 1 98 0 71 mg l in june and 1 51 0 54 mg l in july and is indirectly supported by an algal bioassay p 0 05 t test this study provides a useful approach to the efficient and accurate evaluation of mdon formation which will improve current strategies designed to minimize the effluent mdon in wastewater bioprocesses graphical abstract image 1 keywords mathematical model dissolved organic nitrogen microbial products activated sludge systems wastewater treatment 1 introduction the reduction of effluent inorganic nitrogen in wastewater treatment plants wwtps has been successfully achieved by the upgrading of wastewater treatment technologies such as the retrofitting of conventional bioprocess to biological nutrient removal process eom et al 2017 however dissolved organic nitrogen don remains unimproved resulting in an increase in the proportion of don in effluent nitrogen pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 simsek et al 2016 therefore the removal of don is a future objective needed to comply with the requirements of a tightened stringency of nitrogen discharge regulations hendriks and langeveld 2017 simsek et al 2012 furthermore the interest in don in recent studies is growing due to its close relationship with the membrane fouling xu et al 2010 in wastewater treatment and the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts in drinking water treatment pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 the activated sludge as process is the most common biological wastewater treatment technology for nutrient removal in wwtps effluent don of the as system mainly includes two groups based on the source of its production pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 hu et al 2018 influent derived nitrogenous compounds influent derived don idon that are linked to the components of the influent and are recalcitrant to the biotreatment such as natural nitrogenous organics and trace nitrogenous organics and microorganism derived nitrogenous compounds microorganism derived don mdon which are generated from microbial metabolism in the biological treatment processes such as soluble microbial products smp a recent study on molecular characteristics of mdon emphasized the ability of the as system effluent containing mdon to stimulate algal growth hu et al 2019 additionally since mdon is originated from the biomass growth and decay during the biotreatment processes mdon is inevitable and more tightly than idon associated with operational parameters and engineering conditions pertaining to the microorganisms sattayatewa et al 2009 thus reducing the formation of mdon in the as system is desirable to facilitate strict nitrogen discharge and to protect the receiving waters however the information on mdon removal in wwtps is considerably limited a key barrier to characterizing and regulating the production of mdon is a dilemma pertaining to the quantification of mdon in the real wastewaters existing methods can not directly determine the concentration of mdon the challenge of distinguishing the concentrations of mdon and idon can hardly be addressed through conventional chemical analysis pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 ni et al 2012 xie et al 2016 thus an appropriate technical option needs to be established for mdon determination a comprehensive mathematical model combined with experimental validations can be a powerful tool for the measurement of mdon currently several different models have been developed to quantitatively and qualitatively simulate and predict don concentrations during biological wastewater treatments makinia et al 2011 simsek et al 2012 simsek 2016 bareha et al 2019 these models allow quantification of don concentrations and the quality of predictions is evaluated by experiments makinia et al 2011 modified the activated sludge model asm 2d by differentiating the type of organic nitrogen in the mechanism later the modified mechanism was combined with an internal model of the biowin software to predict the changes in don at varied solids retention times srt and model don concentration in various full scale wwtps simsek et al 2012 2013 2016 these studies provide valuable insight into the transformation of don in real wwtps however none of these studies take into account the role of mdon in bioprocesses mdon is included in don instead of being considered as a separate state variable there is an urgent need to develop a mathematical model to evaluate the formation of mdon during the as processes in practice smp which contains an overlapping portion with mdon westgate and park 2010 has been included and characterized in a series of asms and their modifications ni et al 2009 fenu et al 2010 ni and yu 2011 these smp models describe the production kinetics of different types of smp and provide fundamental information on the factors impacting effluent smp ni et al 2012 xie et al 2016 therefore from a capability perspective the mdon model can be established and implemented in the design and operation of wwtps this work aimed to fill the knowledge gap with regard to quantification of mdon in the as system and to develop an asm based model describing the mdon production kinetics defined as asm mdon model we carried out two different lab scale batch tests to develop and calibrate the asm mdon model and two additional sets of tests on various operational conditions to demonstrate the model application to further assess the universality of the asm mdon model in the full scale wwtps mdon formation in the as process was sufficiently predicted in a municipal wwtp furthermore the reliability of the full scale test was indirectly validated by comparing the predicted results and the data from an algal growth bioassay 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of reactors the laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors sbr were used to cultivate the as and were composed of two parallel identical parent reactors both sbrs had a working volume of 2 l with a 12 h cycle of mixing 6 h aeration 4 h settling 2 h and decanting sun et al 2017 the srt of the reactors was set at 20 d by discarding the as from the reactors and the hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 24 h jarusutthirak and amy 2007 hu et al 2019 the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of the two sbrs was approximately 3000 mg l the seed sludge was collected from a municipal wwtp in nanjing china and washed by milliq water three times prior to inoculum the reactors were operated at room temperature 23 2 c and with dissolved oxygen do of approximately 4 0 mg l during the aeration phase the sbrs were fed with synthetic wastewater as described in a previous study liao et al 2019 which was maintained at ph 7 by dosing 1 mol l hcl or 1 mol l naoh the composition of the influent is described in detail in tables s1 and s2 with chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus of 300 mg l 20 mg l and 3 5 mg l respectively the batch tests of the model were carried out when the sbrs were operated for at least three srts and reached the constant effluent quality ni et al 2009 2 2 batch tests to establish and verify the asm mdon model four independent sets of batch tests were carried out by using the sludge from the sbrs to provide the experimental data for the model calibration validation and application the sludge was inoculated in a 1 l beaker after washing three times with milliq water all batch reactors were operated by the cycle of filling 2 min mixing and aeration 300 min settling 48 min and wasting 10 min driven by the peristaltic pumps the comparison of the influent compositions of tests 1 4 is expanded in table s3 in the first batch test test 1 the influent compositions were the same as the parent reactors the initial ammonia concentration of 20 mg l and mlss concentration of 3000 mg l were maintained in test 1 compared to test 1 the second batch test test 2 was carried out under a different conditions of 30 mg ammonia l and 2000 mg mlss l it is needed to set test 2 under a different operational condition comparing to test 1 thus test 2 was carried out at a higher loading than that in test 1 and was at a higher initial tn concentration and a lower mlss concentration two series of batch reactors test 3 and test 4 were used to test the ability of the new model to simulate and predict mdon formation under various conditions these two tests had the same operation as test 1 and test 2 nevertheless test 3 was carried out in three batch reactors with a gradient of the initial ammonia concentrations 10 20 and 30 mg l and test 4 was operated in three batch reactors with a gradient of mlss 1000 2000 and 3000 mg l the mdon production data from test 3 and 4 were compared with the results simulated by the new model under the same conditions samples were collected every 20 30 min and filtered through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membranes for the analysis of cod tn ammonia nitrate nitrite and don makinia et al 2011 czerwionka et al 2012 the don concentration was calculated by subtracting the concentrations of ammonia nitrate and nitrite from tn saunders et al 2017 every indicator in the four tests was measured in duplicate or triplicate and the average values were input in the model and reported in this study 2 3 description of the full scale wwtp to further explore the applicability of the asm mdon model and the necessity of the modification a full scale test of a wwtp with an oxidation ditch system was carried out grab samples were collected from dc municipal wwtps nanjing china in may july 2019 the primary effluent and the secondary effluent were taken from the primary settling tank and the secondary settling tank respectively the as were obtained from the bioprocess oxidation ditch the dc municipal wwtp on average has a wastewater flow of 300 000 m3 day wastewater the plant primarily treats the domestic wastewater through a carrousel oxidation ditch coagulation rotary disc filter and ultraviolet processes the mlss hrt and srt of the carrousel oxidation ditch were 4000 mg l 18 3 h and 18 1 d respectively the samples were immediately sealed at 4 c before sample analysis all samples were treated and the same indicators were measured as the mentioned batch tests 2 4 algal growth bioassay to assess the potential of don in oxidation ditch effluents to stimulate algal growth a 14 day algal growth bioassay was carried out liu et al 2011 the filtered samples were pretreated by an ion exchange resin dowex 1 8 resin in chloride form sigma aldrich usa selenastrum capricornutum 1 5 ml obtained from fachb collection chinese academy of sciences and mixed culture bacteria 1 0 ml collected from municipal wwtps were selected as the inoculum in the bioassay a nitrate free sample 100 ml which was obtained after ion exchange was mixed with the inoculum in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask the details have been described in the study of liu et al 2011 briefly the bioavailability bioavailable don don can be calculated as a change in don before and after the inoculation 2 5 analytical methods cod tn ammonia nitrate and nitrite were determined by a commercial cod kit hach usa by second derivative uv salicylate second derivative uv and diazotization methods respectively persulfate digestion was performed before tn assay mlss was measured by standard methods epa of china 2002 ph and temperature were determined by an advanced electrochemistry meter orion versa star thermo usa do concentration was measured using an oxygen meter sg6 mettler toledo usa 3 model construction 3 1 conceptual model descriptions a modified model was developed to explore the kinetics of mdon formed in the as system the asm mdon model incorporates seven components and five processes three particulate components include heterotrophic bacteria autotrophic bacteria and inert organic matter four soluble components include mdon nitrate ammonia and do the components are represented as follows xh heterotrophic bacteria xa autotrophic bacteria xi inert organic matter sdon mdon sno nitrite snh ammonia and so do differentiating from the previous models the asm mdon model sets mdon as a new component and simplifies the relative bioprocesses the model is evolved from the conventional asm with the basic concepts based on the fate of don in biomass parkin and mccarty 1981 makinia et al 2011 1 microorganisms release mdon as the metabolites into the effluent during microbial growth and decay 2 part of released mdon can be reassimilated through ammonification by microorganisms sattayatewa et al 2009 and 3 refractory mdon is not bioavailable and is considered as the residual inert matter the conversions in the asm mdon model are schematically illustrated in fig 1 the asm mdon model is based on asm 1 therefore it refers to microbial utilization through heterotrophs and autotrophs the processes of initial production left side and the remineralization right side of mdon are additionally extended in this study the former processes are involved in paths 1 8 path 1 represents the generation of the energy which is needed in the bioprocesses both path 4 and path 8 are the oxygen utilization path 2 and path 5 represent the growth of heterotrophs and autotrophs on the utilization of ammonia respectively path 3 and path 6 represent the generation of mdon in the metabolism of heterotrophs and autotrophs respectively path 7 is the production of nitrate due to the oxidation of ammonia the latter processes are mainly associated with the ammonification of mdon path 9 the residual organic matter which cannot be reutilized path 10 and 12 and the cell decay with the oxygen consumption path 11 and 13 the rate expressions of all paths are shown in table 1 this approach was used for the pragmatic reasons that the proposed model includes the essential processes of the fate of mdon with simplified the rate expressions 3 2 integrated don formation equations the descriptions of stoichiometric coefficients and kinetic parameters kinetic expressions for the related components and the gujer matrix in the new model are listed in table 2 table s4 and table s5 respectively according to the notation the subscripts h and a represent heterotrophs and autotrophs respectively 3 2 1 kinetics of biomass growth and decay a monod kinetics were used as the fundamental equation in the proposed model the kinetics of heterotrophs and

formation comparison of simulated and measured data sensitivity analysis parameters estimation and model adjustment fig 2 the asm mdon model was simulated by a software package aquasim according to the manual and tutorial reichert 1998 the experimental data from test 1 were applied for the calibration of the model parameters the developed model ran under the same conditions as that in test 1 to obtain the simulated data preliminary simulation in the preliminary simulation the default values were assigned to the parameters derived from the basic models and the assumed values were used for the new parameters henze et al 1987 1999 gujer et al 1999 a further step will be run if the simulated data do not match the experimental data sensitive parameters to the prediction of mdon concentrations are identified by sensitivity analysis and optimized by parameters estimation a standard deviation of 10 of parameter values are selected in editing the parameters sensitivity analysis combines identifiability analysis and uncertainty analysis reichert 1998 the effects of parameters on variables simulation can be revealed by the absolute relative sensitivity function eq 6 6 δ y p a r p y p where y is variables concentrations and p is the analyzed parameters the uncertainty analysis was calculated to evaluate the contribution of parameters to the simulated values of mdon 95 confidence interval the model uncertainty is attributed to the error propagation of every parameter and the errors of parameters were calculated as the mean square fitting errors ni et al 2015 7 σ y i 1 m y p i 2 σ p i 2 where p i represents the uncertain parameters σ p i represents the standard deviations of parameters y p1 pm represents the solution of the model expression of variables at a given location and time and σ y represents the approximate standard deviation of the model result the error contribution of parameters the contributions of parameter uncertainties to the total uncertainty is given by eq 8 8 δ y p e r r y p σ p during parameter estimation the parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squares of the weight deviations between experimental data and simulated data as shown in eq 9 9 χ 2 p i 1 n y m e a s i y i p δ m e a s i 2 where y m e a s i represents the i th experimental data δ m e a s i represents its standard deviation y i p represents the predicted data from the new model corresponding to the i th experimental data at the time the experiment is taken p p1 pm represents the parameters and n represents the number of data points a goodness of fit criterion r2 0 81 r 0 9 between the experimental data from test 1 and simulated data is used to select the results when the results satisfy the criterion the parameter estimation ends and the model adjustment is complete sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation were performed according to similar procedure in a recent study lu et al 2018 the kinetical parameters and stoichiometry coefficients used in the asm mdon model after the adjustment are summarized in table 2 3 4 model validation application and universality the validation step was carried out in the adjusted model by comparing the simulated data of variables with a separate set of data from test 2 the concentrations of tn and mlss in test 2 tn of 30 mg l and mlss of 2000 mg l are different from those in test 1 tn of 20 mg l and mlss of 3000 mg l the goodness of fit index is calculated between the simulated data and measured data from test 2 similar as the validation step the model application and universality were tested by comparing the simulated data and experimental data under different conditions the data from tests 3 4 were used for the application step additionally the asm mdon model was implemented in a full scale wwtp and a bioassay was used to indirectly confirm the modeling results and the importance of the asm mdon model 4 results and discussion 4 1 mdon formation in the as system the parent sbrs operated for 100 d 5 srt before the batch tests and the stable performance was achieved a sharp reduction in cod and tn concentrations was observed within the first 2 h in test 1 due to the reaction of microorganisms fig s1 cod and tn were not completely depleted in 6 h because the nitrogenous and carbonaceous compounds were excreted during the microbial metabolism the sole focus on the effluent cod and tn may neglect the conversion mechanisms of different forms of nitrogen the new model successfully predicted the variations in ammonia nitrate and mdon concentrations during a single cycle in test 1 fig 3 the predicted concentrations of ammonia were a good fit to the experimental values fig 3 a showing that ammonia decreased from 20 mg l to 5 mg l after approximately 2 h corresponding to the curves of tn and nitrite fig 3 b illustrates the formation of nitrate by the oxidation of ammonia the trends of nitrate production are adequately described after approximately 3 h from the beginning of the cycle a reasonable explanation for slight overestimation of nitrate production at the beginning of a cycle is that the model uses the concept of single step nitrification for simplification henze et al 1987 and incorporates nitrite into the simulated values of nitrate the linear regression between the measured y axis and simulated x axis values of nitrate fig s2 was assessed a strong linear correlation between the measured and simulated values in the initial 3 h was detected and the slope of the line approached 1 y 0 898x r2 0 951 thus we consider that the slight overestimation of nitrate can be ignored model predictions of mdon generated in test 1 accurately matched the experimental values fig 3 c conforming to the result of linear regression analysis between the measured and simulated data of mdon r2 0 929 p 0 05 it should be noted that the predicted errors of mdon are higher than those obtained during the prediction of the concentration of ammonia and nitrite as a part of don mdon data are consistent with previous studies on the measurement of don pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 saunders et al 2017 indicating a slightly high level of errors the indirect measurement method of don inevitably accumulates errors and reduces the precision of calculated values saunders et al 2017 the new model can predict the exact values of mdon but it also has a similar trend of measured error nevertheless the error can be tolerated and the model formulation can capture the production and loss of mdon by microorganisms 4 2 model validation the model validation was evaluated by comparing the simulated data with the experimental data from test 2 fig 4 shows the results of the concentrations of ammonia nitrate and mdon cod and tn are shown in fig s3 the validation experiment was carried out at various levels of the initial influent of 30 mg tn l and 2000 mg mlss l 20 mg tn l and 3000 mg mlss l in test 1 and the simulated indicators adequately matched the measured data compared to test 1 test 2 was operated using higher concentrations of tn and mlss the agreement between the predicted and measured data remains thus the independent experiment provides further evidence that the model is able to capture well the general trends in the transformation of nitrogen under different conditions however the predicted error of mdon concentrations still fluctuated in a wide range the analysis of error contribution can give an explanation on which parameters are the main contributors to the wide range of error in mdon simulation the error contribution of these parameters to the mdon formation is presented in fig s4 showing that f h d o n i x b and k a are the most influential parameters to mdon concentrations and have higher effects on the mdon uncertainty than any of the other 15 parameters therefore we specifically focused on the values of f h d o n i x b and k a based on the sensitivity coefficient which was automatically calculated in aquasim fraction of mdon formation by heterotrophs f h d o n 1 52 ammonification rate i x b 1 46 and the nitrogen in biomass i x b 0 69 were found to be more sensitive to mdon formation the coefficient within the range of significantly influential values thus the sensitive parameters can induce a greater variation of the predicted values under the same conditions versus other non sensitive parameters these results are also consistent with the concepts of the processes in asm mdon model fig 1 in which mdon formation is closely associated with the utilization f h d o n and i x b and recycle k a 4 3 model application under different conditions the model application was carried out to evaluate the capability of model to simulate the mdon concentrations under different conditions figs 5 and 6 show the simulated curves and measured data under different initial concentrations of ammonia and mlss respectively the model performs accurate simulations of the concentrations of mdon ammonia and nitrate the simulated values matched the experimental values from test 3 and test 4 and the changing trends of the mdon concentrations were captured by the new model this indicates that the new model can be applied under the expanded conditions various trends were observed in test 3 the removal efficiency of ammonia was up to 90 in a single cycle the biokinetics trends of ammonia and nitrate were analogous under different nitrogen load conditions from 10 mg l to 30 mg l within 4 h the monotonic variations were observed in ammonia and nitrate concentrations however the trends of mdon values were different the formation of mdon gradually and monotonically increased when the initial concentrations of ammonia were set to 20 and 30 mg l while mdon concentrations initial concentration of 10 mg ammonia l initially raised but then decreased after 4 h and further declined to 63 9 of the plateau value 1 13 mg l at 5 h 0 72 mg l fig 5a c this result can be explained the dominant ammonification of mdon with regard to the nitrogen utilization in microbial metabolism when ammonia was depleted after 4 h the remineralization of mdon and the utilization of ammonia constitute a part of the nitrogen cycle which are incorporated into microorganisms chubukov et al 2014 ammonia in the external substrate is more accessible than mdon which is produced from microorganisms due to this limitation mdon utilization may be repressed under the ammonia replete conditions and can dominate in the ammonia depleted environments similar to these results the oxidation rate of ammonia and the rate of nitrate and mdon formation were enhanced at the elevating concentrations of mlss fig 6 an increase in mlss concentrations from 1000 to 2000 mg l had slightly positive effects on the formation of mdon and strongly influenced the oxidation of ammonia these effects may be due to the efficiency of microbial metabolism in the biomass in the as moreover the addition of as leads to the augment of biomass and promotes metabolism then ammonia is quickly oxidized to nitrate nitrification or assimilated into nitrogenous microbial products simultaneously the batch reactor of 3000 mg mlss l receiving the same amount of the substrate can reach the plateaus more quickly than other reactors the changes of mdon in fig 6 c are also similar to the trends in fig 5 a as shown in both figs 5 a and 6 c the mdon concentrations changed non monotonically the mdon concentrations initially increased to a plateau and subsequently decreased the operational conditions of the test in figs 5 a and 6 c are under a low loading of wastewater that is a low value of nitrogen concentrations per mlss concentrations it is speculated that microorganisms are able to further remineralize mdon after the depletion of ammonia thus for the same reason as shown in fig 5 a the nonmonotonic trends in fig 6 c are attributed to the switching state from ammonia replete to ammonia depleted conditions overall the indicators predicted by the model were in good agreement with the experimental data under different initial conditions the asm mdon model was able to properly depict the variations of effluent quality this prediction may enable engineers to regulate the bioprocesses with preliminarily estimated results to comply with the requirements of effluent nitrogen limits 4 4 model universality and implementation in a full scale wwtp to further evaluate the universality and applicability of asm mdon mdon generation in a full scale wwtp was simulated the samples were collected before without mdon and after with mdon produced in the oxidation ditch the bioprocesses the parameters defined in the equations were adjusted to match the influent characteristics the profiles of three sampling events are presented in table s6 the samples collected in june and july showed unique variations thus we specifically focused the subsequent efforts on these two samples the measured concentrations of don in the oxidation ditch effluents and the estimated values of mdon are presented in fig 7 the measured don in the effluents were within a common range in previous studies pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 chen et al 2011 no significant differences was observed in the concentrations of effluent don in june 3 85 0 26 mg l and july 4 10 0 44 mg l p 0 05 t test n 6 however mdon concentrations in june were significantly higher than those in july 1 98 0 71 mg l in june 1 51 0 54 mg l in july p 0 05 t test n 6 it is interesting to note that while don concentrations in oxidation ditch effluents were comparable within a similar level the differences in the formation of mdon were detected however mdon formed during the real biotreatment process is barely detectable by the direct measurement method it is unclear whether the results herein were reliable or the data simply deviated from the observable levels studies of mdon on the laboratory scale identified that mdon contained a considerable part of nitrogenous organics with the accessibility for microorganisms such as proteins hu et al 2019 moreover mdon is more readily bioavailable than idon and tends to accelerate eutrophication in the receiving waters pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2006 liao et al 2019 by these deductions an algal bioassay was used as an alternative to assess the reliability of the mdon simulation don bioavailability bioavailable don don is the indicator of the ability of don to promote the algal growth pehlivanoglu and sedlak 2004 simsek et al 2013 we considered the significant components of mdon approaching to bioavailable don if significantly higher don bioavailability and bioavailable don concentrations exist in samples collected in june versus samples collected in july it can be considered as additional evidence supporting our results the bioassay was performed specifically using the oxidation ditch effluent nitrate free samples to compare the impact of the effluents on algal growth don bioavailability of the effluent samples was 68 5 in june and 51 7 in july bioavailable don was 2 62 0 29 mg l in june and 2 09 0 23 mg l in july similarly the bioavailability was significantly different between the samples obtained in june and july p 0 05 t test n 6 suggesting that the effluent sample collected in june is more labile than that obtained in july and may have additional adverse impacts on the receiving wasters furthermore no significant differences between bioavailable don and simulated mdon were detected p 0 05 t test the similarity of these results of mdon simulation indicated that the effluent samples collected in june were more likely to drive eutrophication hence the findings of the full scale test were indirectly confirmed by the relationship between mdon and its bioavailability and by the association of mdon with bioavailable don thus the full scale test with the bioassay revealed that focusing exclusively on the effluent don may be insufficient to characterize the effluent quality and the prediction of mdon could complement the monitoring information moreover the important role of mdon was neglected in previous studies due to the paucity of the quantification method of mdon in full scale wwtps makinia et al 2011 hu et al 2018 hence the development of the asm mdon model with a good universality provides a useful tool to obtain the detailed characteristics of the effluent 4 5 implications the role of mdon in the wwtps may be neglected due to the deficiency of approach to quantify mdon previous research on mdon focused only on the formation and behavior of mdon in the laboratory scale parkin and mccarty 1981 hu et al 2019 liao et al 2019 in these studies the influent to the systems is synthetic wastewater without external don due to the difficulties in segregation of mdon from idon the characteristics of mdon in the biotreatment of the real wastewater are strikingly limited here we report a modified model which can quantify the mdon production in the as processes in the lab and at full scale the fundamental understanding of mdon formation in the wwtps is enhanced by the new model previous studies on the mathematical models have been aware of the importance of organic nitrogen as components in the models makinia et al 2011 simsek 2016 different types of organic nitrogen were added in the models such as particulate organic nitrogen colloid organic nitrogen and biodegradable don makinia et al 2011 none of these included the compound which is only generated by the as microorganisms in the system additionally it is hard to quantify mdon concentrations in the real wastewater the asm mdon model improve this deficiency and incorporate mdon as a separate variable into the model this model can be applied as a complementary tool to assess the effluent quality for example the model may support the estimation of the formation characteristics and removal of mdon in the wwtps in subsequent studies another practical application of the asm mdon model and results of this work can be used to identify the constituents of effluent tn in the real wastewater the formation concentrations of mdon in the as system can be quantified by the new model combining the asm mdon model simulation with the conventional chemical analysis on inorganic nitrogen the detailed information on the concentrations of mdon and inorganic nitrogen can be obtained then the appropriate strategies will be developed in term of the main component of tn the flexible selection and optimization of regulatory strategies can be performed to control nitrogen discharge in terms of whether mdon dominates the effluent nitrogen a proper controlling strategy targeting on the main contributor of effluent tn can decrease the investment in the retrofitting of wastewater treatment technologies thus the asm mdon model can be helpful in the cost efficient control of effluent tn and the improvement of effluent quality however the new model that we proposed has limitations for example some of the simulated values of nitrate were overestimated figs 4 6 the differences between simulated and measured values may be due to the simplification of nitrification processes and the omission of the details ammonia in the influent is undergoing stepwise oxidation by microorganisms to nitrate via nitrification and nitrate which is reduced to nitrogen gas by denitrification yoon et al 2019 moreover both processes can be attributed to the emissions of nitrogen containing gas yoon et al 2019 the generation mechanism of these nitrogenous compounds is complex and includes numerous competing and parallel reactions responsible for the production and consumption of the compound hu et al 2016 thus the nitrification processes are simplified in the models such as asm 1 and model in this study the model proposed in this study can be extended to a nitrogen based model containing more integral processes in further study through a tremendous challenge 5 conclusions in this study the asm mdon model on the formation of mdon in the as system was successfully developed the asm mdon model provides an approach to quantify mdon formation in both lab scale and full scale it can be a useful tool for operational purposes on the wwtps management indeed through the simulation of the asm mdon model the component which dominates the effluent nitrogen can be distinguished and then the corresponding strategy can be applied to regulate the main contributor to the effluent the implementation of a more effective controlling strategy on nitrogen can realize cost efficient management in wwtps declaration of competing interest the authors declare

important stp types in cities in this study the args mobile genetic elements mges and bacterial communities of selected stps including two mstps and one istp in the vicinity of poyang lake were comprehensively investigated through high throughput qpcr and high throughput illumina sequencing the results showed that the profiles of args mges and bacteria differed between the istp and the two mstps most likely due to differences in influent water quality such as the pb that characterized in the istp s influent the longer hydraulic retention times hrts of the two mstps than of the istp may also have accounted for the different profiles thus a prolonged hrt in the cass process seems to allow a more extensive removal of args and bacteria in istps with similar treatment process by

of activated sludge in stps similarly lee et al 2015 found only a weak influence of influent wastewater communities on the communities of activated sludge wastewater treatment generally involves three stages primary treatment by physical operations secondary treatment via biological and chemical processes and tertiary treatment by additional processes overall the three treatment levels result in a significant reduction of the number of bacteria including the total number of resistant bacteria bouki et al 2013 nonetheless although sewage treatment may be generally consistent worldwide

the effects of different sewage sources on the fate of args has yet to be adequately addressed fiorentino et al 2019 in this study the characteristics of args mges and the bacterial communities in two

classes of args were detected in each sample table s3 these included genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides beta lactamases fca mlsb multidrug sulfonamide tetracycline vancomycin not in the gqw effluent sample and others among the 283 targeted arg subtypes 207 were detected in the three stps this result was comparable with ht qpcr data obtained in previous studies zheng et al 2017 guo et al 2017 hu et al 2016 zhao et al 2019b the total arg numbers detected in the influent sludge and effluent samples from the selected stps are shown in fig 2 in each stp arg numbers were highest in the influent samples followed by the effluent samples and lowest in the activated sludge samples both in the oxidation ditch sludge of the two mstps and in the cass sludge of the istp the total arg numbers in both the influent and the effluent samples of the two mstps gqw and cyw were similar and significantly higher p 0 05 than in the respective istp xlw samples by contrast the sludge samples of the two types of stps did not significantly differ p 0 05 in the selected stps aminoglycoside 15 35 26 41 average of 20 89 beta lactamase 15 58 24 07 20 41 and tetracycline 16 45 20 59 18 27 resistance genes were the three dominant arg classes based on their proportions of detected numbers fig s1 antibiotic deactivation average of 52 44 was the most dominant resistance mechanism followed by efflux pump 28 67 and cellular protection 16 53 fig s2 3 1 2 abundance of args the relative abundances target gene copies 16s rrna gene of the nine major classes of args in each sample are shown in fig 3 the dominant args in the three stps were aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes with average abundances of 0 32 and 0 22 copies 16s rrna gene respectively this result is comparable with the results of su et al 2017 who reported relative abundances of args in summer and in winter were 1 73 and 1 15 copies cell respectively based on 116 summer and winter sewage samples collected from the influents of 32 wastewater treatment plants in 17 major chinese cities in our study the xlw influent sample contained the highest relative abundances of aminoglycoside genes and multidrug resistance genes 0 77 and 0 61 copies 16s rrna gene respectively arg abundances in the influent samples of the three stps did not significantly differ however among the sludge samples arg abundance was significantly higher p 0 05 in xlw than in either gqw or cyw by 7 7 and 6 9 fold respectively fig 3 this implied a higher removal efficiency of args during biological treatments in the two mstps than in the istp in addition arg abundance in the effluent samples of the two mstps differed significantly p 0 05 with significant lower arg abundance in the gqw effluent arg abundance in the two mstps showed the pattern influent effluent sludge consistent with the corresponding arg diversity profiles a study of a full scale stp in hong kong has reported similar results that is arg abundance was highest in the influent samples followed by effluent anaerobic digestion sludge and activated sludge samples yang et al 2014 in our istp samples the arg abundance followed the pattern influent sludge effluent fig 3 3 1 3 characterization of mges twelve mges were targeted in our study their total numbers detected in the gqw influent gqw sludge gqw effluent were 9 8 8 0 4 and 9 respectively in the cyw influent cyw sludge and cyw effluent 9 8 3 0 5 7 7 0 6 respectively and in the xlw influent xlw sludge and xlw effluent 9 7 0 6 7 7 0 6 and 8 respectively data not shown the corresponding mge abundances are shown in fig s3 the highest mge abundance 0 52 copies 16s rrna gene was detected in the xlw influent sample mge abundance was significantly higher in the sludge sample of xlw than in the sludges from gqw and cyw p 0 05 for all three stps mge abundance decreased significantly from the influent to the effluent fig s3 the profiles of the arg and mge subtypes and the changes in the levels of those subtypes during the stp treatments are shown in the supplementary information fig s5 and fig s6 3 2 characterization of bacterial communities in the selected stps 3 2 1 diversity of bacterial communities the shannon and simpson indices were used to evaluate the bacterial diversity and the chao1 and ace indices to assess bacterial richness in each of the samples table s4 among the three stps the average bacterial α diversity determined using the shannon index all samples included was 5 27 in xlw 5 12 in cyw and 5 03 in gqw bacterial diversity was significantly higher welch t test p 0 01 in the influent of xlw than in the influents of the two mstps in the effluent and sludge samples of the two mstps bacterial diversity and richness were significantly higher than in the respective influent samples as indicated by the shannon welch t test p 0 01 and chao1 welch t test p 0 05 indices respectively whereas there was no comparable significant difference in the istp samples 3 2 2 bacterial community composition based on a 97 sequence similarity 5433 otu clusters were identified in the selected stps and classified in 17 phyla fig 4 proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes and acidobacteria were the most common phyla with proteobacteria accounting for the largest contribution average of 53 62 followed by bacteroidetes 17 44 and chloroflexi 9 86 less abundant phyla were firmicutes 4 23 and acidobacteria 2 93 previous studies have shown that at the phylum level the bacterial community composition of domestic wastewater is fairly similar worldwide with proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and firmicutes among the major groups narciso da rocha et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a xia et al 2010 quintela baluja et al 2019 in this study proteobacteria 64 51 and chloroflexi 11 39 were dominant in xlw proteobacteria 47 80 and bacteroidetes 27 00 in cyw and proteobacteria 49 71 and bacteroidetes 24 24 in gqw this result also showed that the bacterial community composition of the istp differed from that of the two mstps and the consistency between the two mstps bacterial community abundance at the class and genus levels are shown in fig s4 and table s5 at the otu level the bacterial community distribution of the selected stps revealed the clustering of the respective influent sludge and effluent samples of the two mstps fig 5 this indicated the structural similarity of the bacterial communities of the gqw and cyw despite differences in their treatment capacity hrts and other operating parameters by contrast the influent sludge and effluent samples of xlw tended to cluster together forming a xlw cluster the bray curtis distance of the xlw cluster differed significantly from that of the other three clusters adonis p 0 001 fig 5 which indicated that the clustering pattern was mainly affected by the stp type 3 3 factors influencing the abundance of args and mges in the selected stps due to the complexity of the influencing factors of the args in the stps we employed rda to evaluate the influence of bacterial community abundance and water quality on the arg and mge abundance in the selected stps fig 6 for the eight major bacterial genera in the stps bacteroidetes monte carlo permutation tests p 0 008 and prevotella 9 p 0 046 both members of the phylum bacteroidetes and thauera p 0 024 member of the phylum proteobacteria were the three significant bacterial genera that affected the abundance of args fig 6a these correlations between genera and arg types suggested that genus was the major factor driving the arg distribution pattern su et al 2017 a significant influence was also found in mges on the abundance of args p 0 002 fig 6a which indicated the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer in the selected stps and a role for mges in the persistence and proliferation of the related resistance phenotypes szekeres et al 2018 this was consistent with the dominance of proteobacteria which among bacterial phyla has been shown to harbor most of the investigated plasmids and chromosomal integrons gillings 2014 the analysis of the correlation between conventional water quality indicators and args and mges showed that significant water quality indicators included ec p 0 002 tn p 0 004 po4 3 p 0 006 and orp p 0 028 fig 6b fig 6b also showed that the influent samples of the two mstps were mainly influenced by tn and po4 3 and the samples of xlw were closely related to ec and orp because the selected stps have been operating for many years and their water inflows are relatively stable we also conducted a correlation analysis between specific indicators determined in supplementary monitoring and args and mges in order to better understand the influence of water quality indicators on the args and mges of the two stps fig 6c heavy metal was found to have influence on the abundance of args and mges a significant influence of pb was shown on the abundance of args and mges p 0 002 pb was mainly existed in xlw influent fig 6c which is consistent with the result that ec was closely related to the xlw influent because metal ions are closely related to ec however antibiotics showed insignificant influence on the arg and mge abundance that had been expected p 0 05 3 4 tracking of potential arb in the two mstps and the istp as noted above arg diversity and abundance were significantly lower in the effluent and sludge samples than in the influent samples of each stp figs 2 and 3 accordingly bacteria whose relative abundances were significantly reduced during sewage treatment in the three stps were considered potential arb as also done in other studies narciso da rocha et al 2018 zhao et al 2019a the 15 bacterial genera with the highest abundances were subjected to multiple statistical tests and pairwise comparisons to identify the potential arb in the selected istp and mstps tables s5 and s6 show that the abundances of prevotella 9 and bacteroides were significantly lower in the sludge samples multiple test kruskal wallis h test and pairwise comparisons dunn s test p 0 05 than in the influent samples of cyw and gqw thus these two bacterial genera were considered potential arb in the two mstps in the xlw there was no significant reduction in the abundance of bacterial genera between the influent and effluent or between the influent and sludge samples however the abundances of several bacterial genera including norank f anaerolineaceae thauera denitratisoma norank f nitrosomonadaceae and candidatus competibacter were significantly reduced between the sludge and effluent samples multiple test kruskal wallis h test and pairwise comparisons dunn s test p 0 05 considering the abundances of these bacterial genera and the rda analysis of their influences on the arg and mge abundance fig 6a thauera should be considered the main potential arb in xlw according to these results different arb communities dominated the different types of stps 4 discussion advanced monitoring methods such as ht qpcr and metagenomics analysis have demonstrated that args are ubiquitous in the environment liu et al 2019 lu and lu 2019 in our study while the treatment processes in the three stps were effective in reducing arg abundance most of the arg subtypes were detected in both their influents and their effluents fig 2 indicating that treatment had little effect in reducing arg diversity chen et al 2019 the dominant args in the stps were aminoglycoside beta lactamases and tetracycline resistance genes as reported for other wastewater treatment plants across china su et al 2017 these results reflect the high prevalence of args in the environment the absence of vancomycin resistance genes in the gqw effluent is consistent with the overall low numbers and abundances of these genes in this study and the low level usage of vancomycin in the region of the stps the arg mge and bacterial profiles of the istp were distinct from those of the two mstps however aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes were the two most abundant arg types in all of the stps with the highest levels detected in the influent of the istp figs 3 and 6c this finding can be explained by the production of aminoglycoside antibiotics micronomicin gentamicin etc by the pharmaceutical enterprises of the industrial park whose waste is processed by xlw zhu et al 2017 determined a significant correlation between socio economic parameters and the abundance of aminoglycoside multidrug and sulfonamide resistance genes previous studies have shown that multidrug resistance genes are closely related to heavy metal pollution levels hernandez et al 1998 chen et al 2015 furthermore antibiotic heavy metals and other environmental stressors may act in combination to influence the selection of multidrug resistance plasmids bacterial clones in complex multidrug environments gullberg et al 2014 in this study the distinct arg mge and bacterial profiles could be attributed to the differences in influent water quality composition between the two types of stps specifically the influents of the two mstps were more nutritious and that of the istp with its contamination by heavy metals such as pb more toxic fig 6b and c the influent of xlw also contained a high mge abundance fig s3 in accordance with recent research showing a positive correlation between chemical pollution and mges and between mges and arg abundance lu and lu 2020 in our study inti 1 and tnpa 04 were the two dominant mges in the selected stps table s3 and strong correlations were found between inti 1 clinic and acrr 02 multidrug all samples included pearson s r 0 9785 and between tnpa 04 and aacc2 aminoglycoside all samples included pearson s r 0 8787 the inti and tnpa genes are often used as markers for mges zhu et al 2013 the class 1 integron integrase gene inti detected in clinical settings is able to acquire and spread args and is found in over 70 of gram negative pathogens zhu et al 2017 this gene has also been suggested as a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 the correlation between inti 1 clinic and acrr 02 multidrug determined in this study suggested that the levels of multidrug resistance genes were enhanced by anthropogenic pollutants in the istp such as pb a relationship between tnpa and aacc2 resistance genes was reported by karah et al 2016 who showed that although horizontal gene transfer plays a major role in aacc2 dissemination to genetically diverse bacterial strains it is mediated not by class 1 integrons but rather by transposon structures therefore the dominance of aminoglycoside resistance genes in the xlw may have arisen via horizontal gene transfer by transposons bacterial diversity shannon index was significantly higher in the xlw influent than in the influents of either of the two mstps table s4 this may in part have been due to the introduction of microorganisms together with contaminants from diverse industrial wastewater sources szekeres et al 2018 however the high concentrations of heavy metals substantially reduced microbial diversity in the istp whereas in the two mstps bacterial diversity increased most likely because of higher concentrations of available nutrients sonthiphand et al 2019 previous research showed that akkermansia and prevotella are mostly encountered in domestic wastewater acidaminococcus cloacibacterim and megasphaera mostly in slaughterhouse wastewater and high levels of arcobacter in municipal wastewater containing petroleum products shchegolkova et al 2016 thus influent water quality may select for the dominant bacterial genera our results suggested that the most likely arb were prevotella 9 and bacteroides in the two mstps and thauera in the istp which may also be caused by the different water quality composition of the two stp types however besides the influence of influent water quality composition on the arg mge and bacterial profiles of the stps the diverse treatment processes including the applied disinfection methods may also have played a role based on a series of studies on the effects of wastewater treatment processes on microorganisms and args table s7 we concluded that the biological treatments of stps were effective in args and arb removal but their efficiencies varied due to different plant capacities design parameters and treatment procedures even though these stps adopted the same biological treatments this was also the case at the disinfection stage a higher hrt and solids load in the activated sludge have been shown to facilitate higher microbial removal lopez et al 2019 in this study the bacterial composition dramatically shifted during treatments in the two mstps while minimal changes occurred in the istp fig 5 this distinction can be attributed to the higher hrt in the two mstps 12 24h than in the istp 240 320 min despite comparable solid loads in all three stps table 1 furthermore the fc in arg and meg subtypes during treatment in the mstps and the istp were consistent with their shift in the bacterial composition table s8 and fig 5 these similarities suggest that bacterial communities affect the composition and distribution of arg hosts and further influence the characteristics of args and mges hu et al 2016 thus different hrts may also explain the higher removal of args during biological treatments in the two mstps than in the istp fig 3 this conjecture can also be verified by the different performance between the two mstps in arg removal the relative higher hrt in the gqw 24h than in the cyw 12 14h resulted in significant lower arg abundance in the gqw effluent compared with that of the cyw effluent p 0 05 although arg abundances in their influent samples did not significantly differ together these results indicate that a prolonged hrt in the cass process is a feasible strategy to achieve the removal of larger amounts of args and bacteria in the istps with similar treatment process considering the relatively high arg abundance in the sludge and effluent samples we also conducted a survey of the 107 mstps and 60 istps of the poyang lake basin data not shown among the mstps 94 88 adopt oxidation ditch treatment whereas among the istps 14 use sbr cass 13 anoxic oxic or anaerobic anoxic oxic processes 10 oxidation ditch process and 23 other kinds of treatment many of the istps also adopt combination processes to remove special pollutants and meet the required discharge standards in this study both of the selected mstps adopted oxidation ditch treatment while the istp used sbr cass treatment therefore the selected stps were representative of the two types of stps in the poyang lake region 5 conclusions in this study the characteristics of the args mges and bacterial communities in the selected istp and mstps were investigated using ht qpcr and high throughput illumina sequencing distinct arg mge and bacterial profiles were determined in the istp compared with the two mstps most likely due to the differences in influent water quality composition especially the pb pollution of the istp influent however the difference may also have been due to the different hrts of the two types of stps the results suggested that a prolonged hrt in the cass process offers a feasible strategy to achieve the removal of larger quantities of args and bacteria in istps with similar treatment process however as this research was only a case study in the poyang lake region additional monitoring data from similar types of stps in other regions are needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the different behavior patterns of args and bacterial community during sewage treatment the results will allow the development of targeted measures to control the propagation and diffusion of args and arb in the environment contributors the study was conceived by hd mq jz and yz hd and mq wrote the manuscript with contributions from all the authors

18048,sewage treatment plants stps are significant reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes args and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb municipal stps mstps and industrial stps istps are the two most important stp types in cities in this study the args mobile genetic elements mges and bacterial communities of selected stps including two mstps and one istp in the vicinity of poyang lake were comprehensively investigated through high throughput qpcr and high throughput illumina sequencing the results showed that the profiles of args mges and bacteria differed between the istp and the two mstps most likely due to differences in influent water quality such as the pb that characterized in the istp s influent the longer hydraulic retention times hrts of the two mstps than of the istp may also have accounted for the different profiles thus a prolonged hrt in the cass process seems to allow a more extensive removal of args and bacteria in istps with similar treatment process by providing comprehensive insights into the characteristics of args mges and the bacterial communities of the selected mstps and istp our study provides a scientific basis for controlling the propagation and diffusion of args and arb in different types of stps graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes mobile genetic elements sewage treatment plants industrial sewage

safety and to human health pruden et al 2006 suzuki et al 2008 chen et al 2013 jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2014 li et al 2018 sewage treatment plants stps continuously receive antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args kuemmerer 2009 gao et al 2012 with their high nutrient contents and subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics fungicides and metals in their inflows they are a favorable environment for the spread of args qiao et al 2018 in fact sewage treatment may result in higher arg percentages in the final effluents of stps than in the raw inflow higgins et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 stps discharge 109 1012 colony forming units per day to a receiving water body novo and manaia 2010 and are therefore also an important reservoir for args although traditional stps are not designed for args removal rizzo et al 2013 bacterial community succession and the characteristics of args will change in response to competition predation and the other ecological interactions that occur during biological treatments and depending on the different sensitivities of the bacteria to chemical or uv mediated disinfection di cesare et al 2016 higgins et al 2018 luo et al 2014 rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2019b args and bacterial community patterns in stps are also affected by environmental factors tang et al 2007 novo et al 2013 xu et al 2015 and wastewater treatment processes munir et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 the continuous inflow of wastewater containing different bacterial communities may affect the bacterial communities in the activated sludge of a wastewater treatment bioreactor however shchegolkova et al 2016 demonstrated that the chemical rather than the biological composition of the incoming wastewater is a major determinant of the taxonomic structure of activated sludge in stps similarly lee et al 2015 found only a weak influence of influent wastewater communities on the communities of activated sludge wastewater treatment generally involves three stages primary treatment by physical operations secondary treatment via biological and chemical processes and tertiary treatment by additional processes overall the three treatment levels result in a significant reduction of the number of bacteria including the total number of resistant bacteria bouki et al 2013 nonetheless although sewage treatment may be generally consistent worldwide differences in capacity treatment procedures disinfection doses and other factors may affect the microbial communities of stps in different ways and to different extents kistemann et al 2008 most studies have focused on municipal stps mstps corno et al 2019 luo et al 2014 novo et al 2013 which process anthropogenic waste from a variety of sources by contrast industrial stps istps manage industrial sewage such as the mixed sewage from different enterprises within industrial parks few studies have examined the args and bacterial communities of istps lee et al 2017 and to our knowledge the effects of different sewage sources on the fate of args has yet to be adequately addressed fiorentino et al 2019 in this study the characteristics of args mges and the bacterial communities in two mstps and one istp in the vicinity of poyang lake were investigated using high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ht qpcr and illumina sequencing the factors influencing the different characteristics of the args mges and bacterial community in the selected mstps and istp were also explored the comprehensive insights obtained in this study provide a scientific basis for controlling the propagation and diffusion of args and arb in different types of stps 2 materials and methods 2 1 site selection and sample collection sewage and activated sludge samples were collected from two mstps cyw and gqw and one istp xlw all three stps are located along poyang lake which is the largest freshwater lake in china and the ultimate receiving water body of the selected stps cyw processes municipal waste from nanchang city which is located on the southwest bank of poyang lake and is the capital of jiangxi province the residential population of nanchang was 5 460 000 in 2017 gqw is

classes of args were detected in each sample table s3 these included genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides beta lactamases fca mlsb multidrug sulfonamide tetracycline vancomycin not in the gqw effluent sample and others among the 283 targeted arg subtypes 207 were detected in the three stps this result was comparable with ht qpcr data obtained in previous studies zheng et al 2017 guo et al 2017 hu et al 2016 zhao et al 2019b the total arg numbers detected in the influent sludge and effluent samples from the selected stps are shown in fig 2 in each stp arg numbers were highest in the influent samples followed by the effluent samples and lowest in the activated sludge samples both in the oxidation ditch sludge of the two mstps and in the cass sludge of the istp the total arg numbers in both the influent and the effluent samples of the two mstps gqw and cyw were similar and significantly higher p 0 05 than in the respective istp xlw samples by contrast the sludge samples of the two types of stps did not significantly differ p 0 05 in the selected stps aminoglycoside 15 35 26 41 average of 20 89 beta lactamase 15 58 24 07 20 41 and tetracycline 16 45 20 59 18 27 resistance genes were the three dominant arg classes based on their proportions of detected numbers fig s1 antibiotic deactivation average of 52 44 was the most dominant resistance mechanism followed by efflux pump 28 67 and cellular protection 16 53 fig s2 3 1 2 abundance of args the relative abundances target gene copies 16s rrna gene of the nine major classes of args in each sample are shown in fig 3 the dominant args in the three stps were aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes with average abundances of 0 32 and 0 22 copies 16s rrna gene respectively this result is comparable with the results of su et al 2017 who reported relative abundances of args in summer and in winter were 1 73 and 1 15 copies cell respectively based on 116 summer and winter sewage samples collected from the influents of 32 wastewater treatment plants in 17 major chinese cities in our study the xlw influent sample contained the highest relative abundances of aminoglycoside genes and multidrug resistance genes 0 77 and 0 61 copies 16s rrna gene respectively arg abundances in the influent samples of the three stps did not significantly differ however among the sludge samples arg abundance was significantly higher p 0 05 in xlw than in either gqw or cyw by 7 7 and 6 9 fold respectively fig 3 this implied a higher removal efficiency of args during biological treatments in the two mstps than in the istp in addition arg abundance in the effluent samples of the two mstps differed significantly p 0 05 with significant lower arg abundance in the gqw effluent arg abundance in the two mstps showed the pattern influent effluent sludge consistent with the corresponding arg diversity profiles a study of a full scale stp in hong kong has reported similar results that is arg abundance was highest in the influent samples followed by effluent anaerobic digestion sludge and activated sludge samples yang et al 2014 in our istp samples the arg abundance followed the pattern influent sludge effluent fig 3 3 1 3 characterization of mges twelve mges were targeted in our study their total numbers detected in the gqw influent gqw sludge gqw effluent were 9 8 8 0 4 and 9 respectively in the cyw influent cyw sludge and cyw effluent 9 8 3 0 5 7 7 0 6 respectively and in the xlw influent xlw sludge and xlw effluent 9 7 0 6 7 7 0 6 and 8 respectively data not shown the corresponding mge abundances are shown in fig s3 the highest mge abundance 0 52 copies 16s rrna gene was detected in the xlw influent sample mge abundance was significantly higher in the sludge sample of xlw than in the sludges from gqw and cyw p 0 05 for all three stps mge abundance decreased significantly from the influent to the effluent fig s3 the profiles of the arg and mge subtypes and the changes in the levels of those subtypes during the stp treatments are shown in the supplementary information fig s5 and fig s6 3 2 characterization of bacterial communities in the selected stps 3 2 1 diversity of bacterial communities the shannon and simpson indices were used to evaluate the bacterial diversity and the chao1 and ace indices to assess bacterial richness in each of the samples table s4 among the three stps the average bacterial α diversity determined using the shannon index all samples included was 5 27 in xlw 5 12 in cyw and 5 03 in gqw bacterial diversity was significantly higher welch t test p 0 01 in the influent of xlw than in the influents of the two mstps in the effluent and sludge samples of the two mstps bacterial diversity and richness were significantly higher than in the respective influent samples as indicated by the shannon welch t test p 0 01 and chao1 welch t test p 0 05 indices respectively whereas there was no comparable significant difference in the istp samples 3 2 2 bacterial community composition based on a 97 sequence similarity 5433 otu clusters were identified in the selected stps and classified in 17 phyla fig 4 proteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi firmicutes and acidobacteria were the most common phyla with proteobacteria accounting for the largest contribution average of 53 62 followed by bacteroidetes 17 44 and chloroflexi 9 86 less abundant phyla were firmicutes 4 23 and acidobacteria 2 93 previous studies have shown that at the phylum level the bacterial community composition of domestic wastewater is fairly similar worldwide with proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and firmicutes among the major groups narciso da rocha et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a xia et al 2010 quintela baluja et al 2019 in this study proteobacteria 64 51 and chloroflexi 11 39 were dominant in xlw proteobacteria 47 80 and bacteroidetes 27 00 in cyw and proteobacteria 49 71 and bacteroidetes 24 24 in gqw this result also showed that the bacterial community composition of the istp differed from that of the two mstps and the consistency between the two mstps bacterial community abundance at the class and genus levels are shown in fig s4 and table s5 at the otu level the bacterial community distribution of the selected stps revealed the clustering of the respective influent sludge and effluent samples of the two mstps fig 5 this indicated the structural similarity of the bacterial communities of the gqw and cyw despite differences in their treatment capacity hrts and other operating parameters by contrast the influent sludge and effluent samples of xlw tended to cluster together forming a xlw cluster the bray curtis distance of the xlw cluster differed significantly from that of the other three clusters adonis p 0 001 fig 5 which indicated that the clustering pattern was mainly affected by the stp type 3 3 factors influencing the abundance of args and mges in the selected stps due to the complexity of the influencing factors of the args in the stps we employed rda to evaluate the influence of bacterial community abundance and water quality on the arg and mge abundance in the selected stps fig 6 for the eight major bacterial genera in the stps bacteroidetes monte carlo permutation tests p 0 008 and prevotella 9 p 0 046 both members of the phylum bacteroidetes and thauera p 0 024 member of the phylum proteobacteria were the three significant bacterial genera that affected the abundance of args fig 6a these correlations between genera and arg types suggested that genus was the major factor driving the arg distribution pattern su et al 2017 a significant influence was also found in mges on the abundance of args p 0 002 fig 6a which indicated the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer in the selected stps and a role for mges in the persistence and proliferation of the related resistance phenotypes szekeres et al 2018 this was consistent with the dominance of proteobacteria which among bacterial phyla has been shown to harbor most of the investigated plasmids and chromosomal integrons gillings 2014 the analysis of the correlation between conventional water quality indicators and args and mges showed that significant water quality indicators included ec p 0 002 tn p 0 004 po4 3 p 0 006 and orp p 0 028 fig 6b fig 6b also showed that the influent samples of the two mstps were mainly influenced by tn and po4 3 and the samples of xlw were closely related to ec and orp because the selected stps have been operating for many years and their water inflows are relatively stable we also conducted a correlation analysis between specific indicators determined in supplementary monitoring and args and mges in order to better understand the influence of water quality indicators on the args and mges of the two stps fig 6c heavy metal was found to have influence on the abundance of args and mges a significant influence of pb was shown on the abundance of args and mges p 0 002 pb was mainly existed in xlw influent fig 6c which is consistent with the result that ec was closely related to the xlw influent because metal ions are closely related to ec however antibiotics showed insignificant influence on the arg and mge abundance that had been expected p 0 05 3 4 tracking of potential arb in the two mstps and the istp as noted above arg diversity and abundance were significantly lower in the effluent and sludge samples than in the influent samples of each stp figs 2 and 3 accordingly bacteria whose relative abundances were significantly reduced during sewage treatment in the three stps were considered potential arb as also done in other studies narciso da rocha et al 2018 zhao et al 2019a the 15 bacterial genera with the highest abundances were subjected to multiple statistical tests and pairwise comparisons to identify the potential arb in the selected istp and mstps tables s5 and s6 show that the abundances of prevotella 9 and bacteroides were significantly lower in the sludge samples multiple test kruskal wallis h test and pairwise comparisons dunn s test p 0 05 than in the influent samples of cyw and gqw thus these two bacterial genera were considered potential arb in the two mstps in the xlw there was no significant reduction in the abundance of bacterial genera between the influent and effluent or between the influent and sludge samples however the abundances of several bacterial genera including norank f anaerolineaceae thauera denitratisoma norank f nitrosomonadaceae and candidatus competibacter were significantly reduced between the sludge and effluent samples multiple test kruskal wallis h test and pairwise comparisons dunn s test p 0 05 considering the abundances of these bacterial genera and the rda analysis of their influences on the arg and mge abundance fig 6a thauera should be considered the main potential arb in xlw according to these results different arb communities dominated the different types of stps 4 discussion advanced monitoring methods such as ht qpcr and metagenomics analysis have demonstrated that args are ubiquitous in the environment liu et al 2019 lu and lu 2019 in our study while the treatment processes in the three stps were effective in reducing arg abundance most of the arg subtypes were detected in both their influents and their effluents fig 2 indicating that treatment had little effect in reducing arg diversity chen et al 2019 the dominant args in the stps were aminoglycoside beta lactamases and tetracycline resistance genes as reported for other wastewater treatment plants across china su et al 2017 these results reflect the high prevalence of args in the environment the absence of vancomycin resistance genes in the gqw effluent is consistent with the overall low numbers and abundances of these genes in this study and the low level usage of vancomycin in the region of the stps the arg mge and bacterial profiles of the istp were distinct from those of the two mstps however aminoglycoside and multidrug resistance genes were the two most abundant arg types in all of the stps with the highest levels detected in the influent of the istp figs 3 and 6c this finding can be explained by the production of aminoglycoside antibiotics micronomicin gentamicin etc by the pharmaceutical enterprises of the industrial park whose waste is processed by xlw zhu et al 2017 determined a significant correlation between socio economic parameters and the abundance of aminoglycoside multidrug and sulfonamide resistance genes previous studies have shown that multidrug resistance genes are closely related to heavy metal pollution levels hernandez et al 1998 chen et al 2015 furthermore antibiotic heavy metals and other environmental stressors may act in combination to influence the selection of multidrug resistance plasmids bacterial clones in complex multidrug environments gullberg et al 2014 in this study the distinct arg mge and bacterial profiles could be attributed to the differences in influent water quality composition between the two types of stps specifically the influents of the two mstps were more nutritious and that of the istp with its contamination by heavy metals such as pb more toxic fig 6b and c the influent of xlw also contained a high mge abundance fig s3 in accordance with recent research showing a positive correlation between chemical pollution and mges and between mges and arg abundance lu and lu 2020 in our study inti 1 and tnpa 04 were the two dominant mges in the selected stps table s3 and strong correlations were found between inti 1 clinic and acrr 02 multidrug all samples included pearson s r 0 9785 and between tnpa 04 and aacc2 aminoglycoside all samples included pearson s r 0 8787 the inti and tnpa genes are often used as markers for mges zhu et al 2013 the class 1 integron integrase gene inti detected in clinical settings is able to acquire and spread args and is found in over 70 of gram negative pathogens zhu et al 2017 this gene has also been suggested as a proxy for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 the correlation between inti 1 clinic and acrr 02 multidrug determined in this study suggested that the levels of multidrug resistance genes were enhanced by anthropogenic pollutants in the istp such as pb a relationship between tnpa and aacc2 resistance genes was reported by karah et al 2016 who showed that although horizontal gene transfer plays a major role in aacc2 dissemination to genetically diverse bacterial strains it is mediated not by class 1 integrons but rather by transposon structures therefore the dominance of aminoglycoside resistance genes in the xlw may have arisen via horizontal gene transfer by transposons bacterial diversity shannon index was significantly higher in the xlw influent than in the influents of either of the two mstps table s4 this may in part have been due to the introduction of microorganisms together with contaminants from diverse industrial wastewater sources szekeres et al 2018 however the high concentrations of heavy metals substantially reduced microbial diversity in the istp whereas in the two mstps bacterial diversity increased most likely because of higher concentrations of available nutrients sonthiphand et al 2019 previous research showed that akkermansia and prevotella are mostly encountered in domestic wastewater acidaminococcus cloacibacterim and megasphaera mostly in slaughterhouse wastewater and high levels of arcobacter in municipal wastewater containing petroleum products shchegolkova et al 2016 thus influent water quality may select for the dominant bacterial genera our results suggested that the most likely arb were prevotella 9 and bacteroides in the two mstps and thauera in the istp which may also be caused by the different water quality composition of the two stp types however besides the influence of influent water quality composition on the arg mge and bacterial profiles of the stps the diverse treatment processes including the applied disinfection methods may also have played a role based on a series of studies on the effects of wastewater treatment processes on microorganisms and args table s7 we concluded that the biological treatments of stps were effective in args and arb removal but their efficiencies varied due to different plant capacities design parameters and treatment procedures even though these stps adopted the same biological treatments this was also the case at the disinfection stage a higher hrt and solids load in the activated sludge have been shown to facilitate higher microbial removal lopez et al 2019 in this study the bacterial composition dramatically shifted during treatments in the two mstps while minimal changes occurred in the istp fig 5 this distinction can be attributed to the higher hrt in the two mstps 12 24h than in the istp 240 320 min despite comparable solid loads in all three stps table 1 furthermore the fc in arg and meg subtypes during treatment in the mstps and the istp were consistent with their shift in the bacterial composition table s8 and fig 5 these similarities suggest that bacterial communities affect the composition and distribution of arg hosts and further influence the characteristics of args and mges hu et al 2016 thus different hrts may also explain the higher removal of args during biological treatments in the two mstps than in the istp fig 3 this conjecture can also be verified by the different performance between the two mstps in arg removal the relative higher hrt in the gqw 24h than in the cyw 12 14h resulted in significant lower arg abundance in the gqw effluent compared with that of the cyw effluent p 0 05 although arg abundances in their influent samples did not significantly differ together these results indicate that a prolonged hrt in the cass process is a feasible strategy to achieve the removal of larger amounts of args and bacteria in the istps with similar treatment process considering the relatively high arg abundance in the sludge and effluent samples we also conducted a survey of the 107 mstps and 60 istps of the poyang lake basin data not shown among the mstps 94 88 adopt oxidation ditch treatment whereas among the istps 14 use sbr cass 13 anoxic oxic or anaerobic anoxic oxic processes 10 oxidation ditch process and 23 other kinds of treatment many of the istps also adopt combination processes to remove special pollutants and meet the required discharge standards in this study both of the selected mstps adopted oxidation ditch treatment while the istp used sbr cass treatment therefore the selected stps were representative of the two types of stps in the poyang lake region 5 conclusions in this study the characteristics of the args mges and bacterial communities in the selected istp and mstps were investigated using ht qpcr and high throughput illumina sequencing distinct arg mge and bacterial profiles were determined in the istp compared with the two mstps most likely due to the differences in influent water quality composition especially the pb pollution of the istp influent however the difference may also have been due to the different hrts of the two types of stps the results suggested that a prolonged hrt in the cass process offers a feasible strategy to achieve the removal of larger quantities of args and bacteria in istps with similar treatment process however as this research was only a case study in the poyang lake region additional monitoring data from similar types of stps in other regions are needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the different behavior patterns of args and bacterial community during sewage treatment the results will allow the development of targeted measures to control the propagation and diffusion of args and arb in the environment contributors the study was conceived by hd mq jz and yz hd and mq wrote the manuscript with contributions from all the authors

18049,a hierarchically assembled superomniphobic membrane with three levels of reentrant structure was designed and fabricated to enable effective treatment of low surface tension hypersaline oily wastewaters using direct contact membrane distillation dcmd the overall structure is a combination of macro corrugations obtained by surface imprinting with the micro spherulites morphology achieved through the applied phase inversion method and nano patterns obtained by fluorinated silica nanoparticles sinps coating this resulted in a superomniphobic membrane surface with remarkable anti wetting properties repelling both high surface tension water and low surface tension oils measurements of contact angle ca with di water an anionic surfactant oil and ethanol demonstrated a robust wetting resistance against low surface tension liquids showing both superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity ca values of 160 8 2 3 and 154 3 1 9 for water and oil were obtained respectively calculations revealed a high liquid vapor interface for the fabricated membrane with more than 89 of the water droplet contact area being with air pockets entrapped between adjacent sinps and only 11 come into contact with the solid membrane surface moreover the high liquid vapor interface imparts the membrane with high liquid repellency self cleaning and slippery effects characterized by a minimum droplet membrane interaction and complete water droplet bouncing on the surface within only 18 ms when tested in dcmd with synthetic hypersaline oily wastewaters the fabricated superomniphobic membrane demonstrated stable non wetting md operation over 24 h even at high concentrations of low surface tension 1 0 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate and 400 ppm oil potentially offering a sustainable option for

their adverse impacts on the environment and water bodies jamaly et al 2015 tanudjaja et al 2019 membrane distillation md a membrane based technology that utilizes low grade thermal energy waste heat or solar energy offers a viable option for treatment of industrial wastewaters an et al 2016 deka et al 2019b duong et al 2016 gryta et al 2001 huang et al 2017 tong and elimelech 2016 this is because md is not affected by the feed salt concentration and can achieve a theoretical 100 solute rejection with hypersaline feeds boo et al 2016a zheng et al 2018 however when treating feeds containing organic and low surface tension contaminants such as oils and surfactants wetting and fouling of traditional md membranes become inevitable leading to reduced vapor flux poor permeate quality and decreased energy efficiency restraining md s implementation for industrial wastewater reclamation boo et al 2016a lu et al 2019 wang et al 2016b low surface tension contaminants represent the primary cause for wetting in md particularly when treating challenging hypersaline and oily wastewaters deka et al 2019a rezaei et al 2018 in recent years superhydrophobic and omniphobic membranes gained substantial interest due to their ability to minimize the problems of wetting and fouling in md even when dealing with challenging wastewaters contaminated with low surface tension material chen et al 2018b j lee et al 2016 lin et al 2014 woo et al 2018 superhydrophobic membranes which are defined as membranes with a static water contact angle caw higher than 150 han et al 2012 were first developed to improve the fouling and wetting resistance of membranes lu et al 2017 meng et al 2015 2014 tian et al 2015a these membranes are inspired by the superhydrophobic self cleaning properties of the natural lotus leaf surface known as the lotus effect barthlott and neinhuis 1997 thereafter mimicking nature has inspired researchers to develop similar bio inspired superhydrophobic surfaces ahmmed et al 2017 das et al 2018 ghasemlou et al 2019 liu et al 2010 in doing so both surface chemistry and morphology are tackled hensel et al 2016 which particularly involve 1 lowering the membrane s surface energy by chemical modification through surface fluorination and silanisation figoli et al 2017 liu et al 2016 tian et al 2015a and 2 increasing surface roughness by different techniques such as electrospinning and electrospraying deka et al 2019b woo et al 2016 etching qian and shen 2005 and coating si and guo 2015 however and despite their improved wetting resistance lotus inspired superhydrophobic membranes still have limitations such as their low durability and insufficient repellence of low surface tension liquids hensel et al 2016 for instance superhydrophobic membranes are vulnerable to surfactants wetting si and guo 2015 to address these limitations omniphobic superomniphobic membranes being both hydrophobic superhydrophobic and oleophobic superoleophobic have been recently reported to mitigate membrane wetting salimi 2019 siyal et al 2019 of both high and low surface tension liquids including polar solvents e g toluene diiodomethane and non polar alkanes and

omniphobic membranes lu et al 2019 springtails a modern hexapod have the ability to breathe through their cuticle surface regardless of if it s under water oil or other liquids boban et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 the omniphobic property of the springtail s surface has been found to be due to its cuticle re entrant structure and a low surface energy lipids layer hensel et al 2016 for designing an omniphobic membrane that is repellent to not only high surface tension water but also low surface tension oils it is well agreed that a combination of both hierarchical re entrant surface curvature and the use of membrane materials of low surface energy or surface modification using such materials such as fluoropolymers and hydrocarbons mimicking springtail is needed chu and seeger 2014 various successful attempts to fabricate omniphobic membranes for md of low surface tension and oily wastewater feeds have been reported boo et al 2016b boo et al 2016a chen et al 2018a 2018b deka et al 2019a

water and polar and non polar low surface tension solvents chu and seeger 2014 an early study from 2007 on the design of superomniphobic surfaces reported a re entrant surface curvature design combined with membrane chemistry and rough textured surface tuteja et al 2007 in 2014 an omniphobic md membrane was fabricated by coating a hydrophilic glass fiber membrane with silica nanoparticles sinps to develop a re entrant structure followed by surface fluorination to lower the membrane surface energy lin et al 2014 the developed membrane showed a high ca of 140 and 110 for water and mineral oil respectively but below 90 for polar ethanol and non polar decane on another front corrugation or patterning as a physical modification of membrane surface topography have been applied to enhance the fouling and scaling resistance of membranes including in md armbruster et al 2018 choi et al 2017 ding et al 2017 kharraz et al 2015b 2015a kochkodan et al 2014 pawlowski et al 2019 2016 wiese et al 2019 won et al 2012 2016 xiao et al 2019b xie et al 2017 corrugated membranes were found to improve flux stabilization when tested with seawater and concentrated brine in dcmd kharraz et al 2015a the aforementioned studies attributed the enhanced fouling resistance of corrugated membranes to the improved feed hydrodynamics introduced by surface patterns however surface corrugations in md mainly improve flux and reduce fouling but do not reduce wetting by high or low surface tension liquids in a previous study kharraz and an 2019 we reported the fabrication of a superhydrophobic patterned membrane spm by combining macro surface patterns with surface fluorination to reduce the membrane s surface energy the combined physical and chemical modifications resulted in an spm with a high water ca of 155 we proved the advantage of surface patterns in inducing favorable flow hydrodynamics that increased surface area and highly enhanced fouling resistance when tested in extended md experiments with real seawater feed moreover the superhydrophobicity of spms resulted in an improved wetting resistance with a stable flux and salt rejection when the feed seawater was spiked with up to 0 4 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate sds however further addition of sds lowered the feed s surface tension to a limit that overcame the energy barrier for a transition from the metastable cassie state to the complete wetting of the wenzel state and consequently wetting was observed at 0 5 mm sds the spm wetting resistance was tested with low surface tension sds but not with non polar solvents such as oils building on our spm work in this study we report on a macro corrugated and nano patterned superomniphobic membrane som that can sustain the metastable cassie state even with non polar low surface tension oils instead of chemically breaking the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction by developing a hydrophilic layer that involves the usage of harmful chemicals with concerning environmental effects on the membrane surface as attempted by other researchers to tackle membrane fouling huang et al 2017 wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2013 breaking this interaction physically through the development of surface corrugations was herein adopted the macro corrugations are expected to improve fouling resistance while the nano patterns resulting from sinps deposition along with surface fluorination create a re entrant structure to reduce surface energy as a result a hierarchically structured som was created with improved wetting resistance to both high and low surface tension liquids the fabricated superomniphobic membrane was characterized and tested in low surface tension oily wastewater treatment in a dcmd system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf

imprint the surface macro corrugations a non woven polypropylene pp sheet novatexx 2471 freudenberg vilene germany was used as a support for membrane casting a commercial flat sheet pvdf membrane hereinafter referred to as commercial with a nominal pore size of 0 22 μm and thickness of 119 μm gvhp durapore was purchased from merck millipore and used for benchmarking 2 2 design of the superomniphobic membrane and reference membranes a negatively charged macro corrugated membrane hereinafter referred to as cm was first fabricated through a modified phase inversion process as described in the next section the cm was further treated with naoh and aptes to render it positively charged and was then coated by a negatively charged sinps through electrostatic interaction followed by fluorination of the sinps through immersion in fas n hexane solution the resultant is macro corrugated and sinps patterned superomniphobic membrane som as illustrated in fig 1 as a benchmark two additioanl membranes were tested in dcmd experiments against the som s performance a commercial hydrophobic membrane and a fabricated superhydrophobic corrugated membrane hereinafter referred to as scm the fabrication of the scm followed the same chemical treatment procedure as for the som i e treatment with naoh and aptes except that the surface was then fluorinated without sinps deposition 2 3 fabrication of the macro corrugated membrane the cm is comprised of two layers and was fabricated through a combination of non solvent induced phase separation nips and vapor induced phase separation vips techniques for the first and second layers respectively the cm was fabricated in two layers because introducing a spacer imprinting step to form the corrugations as discussed below into the fabrication of a single layer membrane resulted in large pores not suitable for md application nips was used for fabrication of the first layer to achieve a small mean pore size and a controlled pore size distribution while vips was used for fabrication of the second layer to form macro corrugations and achieve desirable hydrophobicity and roughness the cm was used as a base layer for the scm and som membranes an illustration of the cm fabrication procedure is presented in fig 2 with additional details included in our previous study kharraz and an 2019 briefly 12 wt pvdf solution in dmac was stirred at 60 c until the pvdf was completely dissolved and then left overnight to de gas the prepared solution was then cast on the pp support at a casting thickness of 200 μm followed by immediate immersion into deionized di water coagulation bath for 40 min then drying in ambient air overnight a second layer of 10 wt pvdf in dmac was cast at a casting thickness of 200 μm on top of the first layer while the second layer is still liquid a diamond shaped net spacer was used to make an imprint on top of the layer and its imprinting depth was fixed to 0 7 mm the spacer string thickness this was followed by 5 min exposure to 80 relative humidity rh then immersion in a di water coagulation bath after 1 min inside the bath the spacer was manually delaminated from the nascent membrane and the latter was left in the bath for 40 min followed by overnight drying in ambient air the resultant membrane appeared as negatively charged over the investigated 3 9 ph range 2 4 sinps deposition and surface fluorination to deposit the negatively charged sinps and subsequently apply fluorination on the membrane surface the negatively charged cm had to be first activated and made positively charged to do so the cm was wetted with ethanol and alkaline treated by immersion into a 7 5 m naoh aqueous solution at 70 c for 3 h to functionalize the surface with the necessary hydroxyl groups alkaline treated cm after that the membrane was immersed into a 3 v v aptes ethanol at 60 c for 1 h to functionalize the surface with amine groups which resulted in a positively charged cm amino functionalized cm the wetted positively charged cm was then immersed into a 0 03 wt sinps suspension prepared in a ph 6 acetate buffer for 1 h to reinforce an electrostatic attraction between the positively charged cm and the negatively charged sinps yielding an sinps patterned cm the membrane was then washed with acetate buffer and di water and dried at 80 c lastly the sinps were fluorinated by immersing the sinps patterned cm into a 1 v v fas n hexane at 60 c for 24 h where a hydrolysis reaction between the silica surface and fas resulted in an som with highly reduced surface energy the scm was achieved following the same procedure as described above but the surface was fluorinated without including the sinps deposition step i e the cm alkaline treated by naoh amino functionalized by aptes and surface fluorinated by fas 2 5 membrane characterization the surface morphology of the modified membranes was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem fei quanta feg 540 samples were first sputter coated with a gold layer for 100 s btt iv denton vacuum llc moorestown nj a fourier transform infrared ftir iraffinity 1 shimadzu spectrometer operated in attenuated total reflectance atr mode was used to analyse the elemental composition of the membrane samples for each sample the absorbance spectra of 50 scans taken with a resolution of 4 cm 1 were measured pore size and pore size distribution psd were measured using a capillary flow porometer porplux 1000 belgium supplementary information method s1 liquid entry pressure lep of the membrane samples was measured using an in house assembled gas liquid displacement setup supplementary information method s2 the zeta potential ζ potential of the membrane surface was measured based on the streaming current technique using a streaming potential analyzer surpass anton paar austria equipped with an adjustable gap cell 1 mm potassium chloride kcl solutions were used as the control electrolyte to perform measurements and adjusted with potassium hydroxide koh and hydrochloric acid hcl at each ph value the ζ potential of the sinps was measured using a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano malvern panalytical ltd with a range of ph values adjusted using acidic 0 1 m hcl and basic 0 1 m naoh solutions the samples were then placed in a pre rinsed folded capillary cell and the zeta potential values were measured the stability of the sinps coating was evaluated by measuring and comparing the ca of the som before and after exposure to physical and chemical stresses the physical stress included placing the som membrane in a sonication bath for 20 min while the chemical stress included immersion in highly acidic hcl ph 2 and highly basic naoh ph 12 solutions for 20 min the surface wetting properties of the membranes were evaluated through measurement of ca with liquids of different surface tension γ values including water γ 72 8 mn m 1 5 mm sds solution γ 34 9 mn m 1 vegetable oil γ 32 2 mn m 1 and ethanol γ 22 1 mn m 1 using a drop shape analyzer dsa25 kruss germany a 3 μl liquid droplet was used to measure the ca at 3 locations at least and for 3 different samples of each membrane the average ca value was reported the sliding angle sa of all membranes was measured by fixing a membrane sample on a glass slide using double sided tape and placing a 4 μl droplet of di water on the membrane surface the glass slide was then manually tilted and the tilt angle at which the water droplet started rolling off the membrane surface was recorded as the sliding angle the fractions of liquid solid fs i e water droplet in contact with the solid membrane surface and liquid gas fg i e water droplet in contact with entrapped air interfaces of the membranes were calculated based on the cassie baxter mode equation 1 cos θ f s cos θ f g cos θ g where ɵ is the measured or apparent contact angle ɵ and ɵg are the equilibrium contact angles of the liquid droplet on solid and gas respectively ɵg is usually approximated as 180 because of the low gas liquid molecules adhesion lu et al 2019 while fs fg 1 resulting in equation 1 to be simplified as 2 cos θ 1 f s 1 cos θ the intrinsic contact angle ɵ in equations 1 and 2 is that of the solid vapor liquid interface on surfaces that are non permeable chemically homogeneous and atomically smooth chu and seeger 2014 thus for the fabricated scm and som to measure ɵ a smooth flat and non permeable surface was obtained by melting the membrane that was fabricated using the same procedure as scm or som but without corrugations through heat pressing at 185 c for 5 min for the commercial membrane ɵ was measured after heat pressing the same membrane at 170 c for 5 min the first interaction of a water droplet with the som surface bouncing or slipping effect was analyzed by dropping a freely flowing water droplet from an accurate needle connected to a dual syringe infusion pump kds 200p kdscientific a high speed camera system memrecam hx 6e nac image technology with a frame rate of 5000 frame s was used to monitor and record the water contact behavior with the membrane surface for comparison the water droplet interaction with a flat surface omniphobic membrane fom fabricated the same way as the som but without surface corrugations was also analyzed 2 6 membrane distillation performance tests dcmd experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the commercial scm and som membranes with feed and permeate temperatures maintained at 60 and 20 c respectively the cumulative mass and conductivity of the permeate were constantly recorded and later used for calculations of water flux and salt rejection respectively a schematic diagram of the dcmd setup with details on operational parameters can be found in supplementary information fig s1 dcmd wetting and fouling experiments were performed by adding either sds surfactant as a wetting promoter or oil as a foulant to the saline feed feed and permeate flow rates for all md experiments were set at 400 and 200 ml min 1 respectively the dcmd performance of all three membranes commercial scm and som was then compared for the wetting experiments a low surface tension amphiphilic surfactant sds was incrementally added to a 1 m nacl feed solution to reduce the feed s surface tension and promote membrane wetting higher flowrate was applied on the feed side 400 ml min 1 in order to create a greater hydraulic pressure for the feed stream than that of the permeate stream 200 ml min 1 facilitating easier detection of membrane wetting as an increase in both water flux and permeate conductivity would be a sign of wetting occurrence the concentrations of sds used in these tests were 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 1 0 mm in fouling experiments vegetable oil a surrogate for a low surface tension foulant was used to prepare 1 v v oil in water emulsion under overnight strenuous mixing which was incrementally added to a 1 m nacl 0 05 mm sds feed solution as the dcmd feed the inclusion of sds in this oily feed was to mimic challenging wastewaters where both foulants and surfactants are presented and to test the membrane s behavior under these conditions the concentrations of oil used in these tests were 50 100 200 and 400 ppm 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and surface properties of the superomniphobic membrane the combination of nips and vips processes during the fabrication of the first and second layers of the corrugated membranes respectively has been chosen to control the pore size hydrophobicity roughness as well as to achieve the desired properties for a good base membrane as described in detail in our previous study kharraz and an 2019 while nips was used in fabricating the first layer mainly to control the pore size vips was used in fabricating the second layer because it results in membranes having an open porous structure and higher roughness surfaces with high ca and hydrophobicity peng et al 2012 tian et al 2015b showed that the water ca of membranes is closely related to the membrane surface morphology in which a higher water ca i e higher hydrophobicity is associated with a more open surface morphology in our study the applied relative humidity i e 80 and exposure time i e 5 min of the vips process for fabricating the second layer were selected in such a way to maximize the surface hydrophobicity and roughness the net spacer figs 3a 1 imprinting step resulted in the first macro level of the hierarchical structure that appeared as macro corrugations figs 3a 2 these macro corrugations are expected to increase the membrane surface area and promote flow turbulence near the surface which in return decreases the propensity for fouling kharraz et al 2015b won et al 2012 the extent of increase in surface area and decrease in fouling propensity were shown to be dependent on the shape of the spacer used based on our preliminary testing with different spacers which had different shapes and dimensions the net spacer used in this study was selected as it demonstrated the highest increase in surface area and lowest fouling propensity surface area of the cm membrane was increased by 42 compared to the commercial membrane i e flat membrane which was estimated by simple approximate calculations assuming a flat surface for the commercial membrane and a flat surface mounted by channel shape corrugations for the cm the dimensions and height of the channel shape corrugations were manually measured by a caliper and shown in figs 3a 2 the applied exposure to humidity during the vips step resulted in a rough and open surface morphology for the virgin cm fig 3a 3 the morphology shows the dominant presence of pvdf crystals spherulites as a result of a slower vapor uptake rate when pre exposed to humidity before immersion in the water bath giving the pvdf crystal nuclei time to grow radially and form such spherulites almarzooqi et al 2017 the micrometer sized pvdf spherulites constituted a micro level second step of the hierarchical structure when the amine functionalized cm was immersed in sinps suspension electrostatic attraction between the positively charged cm and negatively charged sinps promoted the deposition and coating of the sinps onto the surface of the cm fig 3a 4 shows the som completely covered with sinps while the inset shows the uniform distribution of sinps on an individual pvdf string the spherical geometry of the sinps provides the necessary re entrant structure boo et al 2016a and contributed to the formation of a nano level the third step of the hierarchical structure yielding a superomniphobic membrane som fig 3b shows the measured ζ potential values as a function of ph the virgin cm appeared as negatively charged throughout the whole tested ph range although pvdf does not show particular surface charge previous studies attributed this negative charge to the possible adsorption of cl and oh anions from the background electrolyte boo et al 2016a j lee et al 2016 when alkaline treated with a 7 5 m naoh solution the pvdf polymer of the cm was decorated with hydroxyl functional groups resulting in a hydrophilic surface and consequently showed more negative ζ potential over the whole ph range the membrane was then immersed in 3 v v aptes ethanol solution in which it reacted with the hydroxyl groups through hydrolysis and condensation the amine functionalized cm showed increased ζ potential value rendering it positively charged at ph values lower than 6 8 the sinps suspension showed negative ζ potential values within the ph range tested and accordingly an acetate buffer with ph 6 was chosen to act as the medium for the sinps suspension at which the amine functionalized cm is positively charged facilitating the electrostatic attraction of the sinps although zeta potential was not measured for the fabricated som but rather used as a characterization technique to decide at what ph the sinps suspension should be prepared to facilitate their electrostatic interaction with the positively charged amino functionalized cm it should be pointed out that previous studies showed the effect of membrane charge on membrane fouling and wetting an et al 2016 chen et al 2017 guo et al 2018 for instance testing of two negatively charged pvdf commercial membranes one being virgin while the other is modified to be superhydrophobic in dcmd using cationic anionic surfactant emulsified oil in water emulsions revealed severe membrane wetting for the virgin membrane with both surfactant emulsified emulsions on the other hand the superhydrophobic membrane showed a stable md performance when tested with the anionic surfactant emulsified emulsion but experienced severe membrane wetting with the cationic surfactant chen et al 2017 the presence of sinps coating as well as the subsequent fluorination was further confirmed by examining the ftir spectra of the cm sinps coated cm and som fig 3c shows the 800 1400 cm 1 wide view of the ftir spectra that covers the characteristic absorbances of the distinct functional groups a new peak at 1110 cm 1 that corresponds to the silanol groups on the sinps boo et al 2016a was observed after the amine functionalized cm was immersed and coated with sinps additionally after the cm was immersed in 1 v v fas n hexane a noticeable rise in absorbance intensity at 1140 cm 1 was observed which is a result of the cf2 symmetric stretching mode confirming successful surface fluorination boo et al 2016a in addition to the re entrant structure provided by the spherical sinps surface fluorination resulted in lower membrane surface energy ultimately achieving a superomniphobic surface all three membranes i e commercial scm and som show a narrow psd within the range that is favorable for md khayet and matsuura 2011 after sinps coating the som showed a reduction in mps 0 199 0 032 compared to the scm 0 224 0 023 which was mainly attributed to the sinps coating partially blocking some surface pores supplementary information fig s2 a summary of membrane properties is presented in table s1 supplementary information both scm and som showed relatively similar porosities 62 1 2 23 and 61 3 2 64 respectively to that of the commercial membrane 66 8 1 13 on the other hand thanks to their smaller pore size and higher hydrophobicity resulting from surface and sinps fluorination that led to reduced surface energy the scm and som showed 62 3 28 0 12 bars and 84 3 73 0 16 bars higher lep respectively than that of the commercial membrane 2 03 0 05 bars the first and second layers of the cm were each casted at a thickness of 200 μm however during solidification and gelation of the cast film in the coagulation bath as a result of the phase inversion mechanism the cast film experienced vertical shrinkage i e thickness reduction and thus the resulting membrane thickness was much thinner than that of the original cast film 183 2 2 and 185 2 6 μm for the scm and som respectively the trade off between mass and heat transfer resistances of md membranes was considered and casting thickness was chosen accordingly after a few trials in a way which would yield a membrane with a thickness in the range suitable for md application and comparable to that of the commercial membrane to allow for fair comparison 3 2 wetting properties and resistance of the superomniphobic membrane surface wetting properties of the commercial scm and som were characterized in terms of their contact angles with different liquids namely di water γ 72 8 mn m 1 5 mm sds γ 34 9 mn m 1 vegetable oil γ 32 2 mn m 1 and ethanol γ 22 1 mn m 1 the results are shown in fig 4 these particular liquids were chosen to evaluate the membranes wetting behavior with liquids of varying surface tensions as many industrial wastewater streams contain mixed and challenging wetting agents including both amphiphilic surfactants and hydrophobic oils the commercial membrane showed a hydrophobic interaction with water ca of 123 1 1 5 but a much lower contact angle with all the other three liquids while the membrane showed a relatively low and unstable ca with 5 mm sds 82 7 2 1 upon initial droplet contact and 70 5 1 6 3 min thereafter fig 4a and b both oil and ethanol completely wicked the commercial surface either within few seconds for oil or immediately for ethanol fig 4c the scm exhibited stable superhydrophobicity ca with water 152 4 2 3 due to its reduced surface energy as a result of surface fluorination it also demonstrated a wetting resistance to 5 mm sds high and stable ca of 143 1 1 9 but greater wetting propensity for both low surface tension liquids oil and ethanol in fact ethanol showed a very low ca of 23 6 2 0 upon droplet touch fig 4a but completely wicked the surface after a few minutes fig 4b and c the som on the other hand showed highly improved wetting resistance against all tested liquids superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity were achieved with water and oil having stable cas of 160 8 2 3 and 154 3 1 9 respectively while 5 mm sds and ethanol showed high and stable ca of 148 3 1 6 and 118 7 2 2 respectively although the measurement of ethanol ca after 3 min was not possible due to droplet evaporation it was still evident that none of the tested liquids was able to wick the som surface fig 4b and c the improved wetting resistance of the som surface against different high and low surface tension liquids is a result of a combination of hierarchical re entrant surface curvature and low membrane surface energy both of which are pre requisites for an omniphobic surface chu and seeger 2014 the low durability of the superhydrophobic nature of the membrane surfaces is a drawback hensel et al 2016 and one of the main reasons driving the development of omniphobic surfaces the durability of the nano patterns created by the sinps deposition on the som is critical to sustaining the cassie baxter state and the subsequent liquid repellency this durability mainly relies on the robustness of surface properties which in turn depends on the stability of sinps and fas coating to test this stability the som was subjected to physical and chemical stresses ca with the som for the same four liquids after these stresses were measured and compared to those with the som before being subjected to the stresses as shown in fig 4d immersion of the som in highly acidic and basic solutions or bath sonication for 20 min did not result in any significant change in the measured ca with any of the liquids water 5 mm sds oil and ethanol this observation confirms the presence of a stable cassie baxter state for the som as a result of robust sinps attachment and fas coating when the spherical sinps were attached to the membrane surface nano scale patterns were generated the gaps within these nano scale adjacent patterns are not easily filled by liquid but instead are filled with air that is trapped beneath the liquid in such a case the contact area between the liquid and the surface of the som is highly reduced resulting in very high ca values due to the repellence between the liquid and the hydrophobic air underneath it lu et al 2019 as evident in fig 5a1 2 both the commercial and the unmodified cm showed high adhesion to water droplets with no apparent repellency supplementary information video v1 the wetting behavior of the som in such a state falls under the cassie baxter regime the presence of nano patterns and the air entrapment as a result thereof maintain an energy barrier that is difficult to be overcome by the liquid even using low surface tension liquids such as oil and ethanol helbig et al 2011 additionally fluorination of sinps by fas coating contributted to the ultra low surface energy of the som such ultra low surface energy did not only contribute to the superhydrophobicity and surface repellence of the som but also yielded a self cleaning property i e slippery effect as shown in fig 5a3 4 see the video in supplementary information video v2 water droplets freely rolled on the som surface without any sticking mimicking the superhydrophobic and self cleaning surface of the lotus leaf where dust particles get attached to the freely rolling liquid droplets the solid vapor liquid interface in the case of scm and som follows a cassie baxter state which can be characterized by equation 2 as explained in section 2 5 based on that equation fig 5c shows an estimation of the area fractions of solid liquid and air liquid interfaces for all three membranes the area fraction of the solid liquid interface represents the fraction of the water droplet in contact with the solid membrane surface which had its highest value 0 789 for the commercial membrane followed by scm 0 620 and som 0 104 despite its hydrophobic nature the commercial membrane surface shows high adhesion to water droplets supplementary information video v1 with an area fraction of only 0 211 of a water droplet in contact with air fig 5c the introduction of macro corrugations resulted in a small increase of the liquid air fraction for the scm 0 380 however when coated with sinps the som showed a remarkable increase in the air liquid interface with approximately 89 6 of the water droplet area in contact with air fig 5c this high liquid air interface is attributed to the high amount of air entrapped between the adjacent sinps beneath the water droplet which was the main reason behind its superomniphobic surface property sliding angle measurements fig 5b showed good correlation with the estimated area fractions of the solid liquid and air liquid interfaces when a water droplet was placed on top of the commercial membrane surface the droplet was pinned to the surface and tilting the surface until it became perpendicular to the plane or even upside down still did not cause the droplet to roll off sa 90 such behavior was expected for the commercial membrane due to its large area fraction of the solid liquid interface the scm showed a much lower but relatively high sa of 22 4 3 2 due to its superhydrophobicity in contrast the som showed the lowest sa of 3 8 1 3 which also correlates to its high area fraction of the air liquid interface the ultralow sa of the som which is a result of the low surface free energy and the hierarchical structure created by dual scale roughness of micro morphology and sinps coating followed by fluorination is a direct cause for its slippery surface as explained below recent studies have introduced a slippery theory which relates a low sa to a slippery surface effect xiao et al 2020 2019a 2019b a surface with an sa higher than 90 such as the commercial membrane in our study is defined as a sticky surface causing a liquid to be non slip xiao et al 2019b this was the case for the commercial membrane where tilting the membrane surface at an angle of 90 or greater did not result in droplet slip off but rather the droplet was pinned to the surface for an sa lower than 10 a slippery surface was defined causing the liquid to float above the solid air interface xiao et al 2019b which is in good agreement with the slippery effect noticed for the som upon interaction with a falling water droplet as will be discussed in the following paragraph the scm had an sa of 22 4 away from the 90 limit of stickiness and was closer to the 10 limit of slipperiness accordingly moving its superhydrophobic surface more towards a slippery behavior to further understand the surface behavior a 5 μl water droplet was allowed to freely drop from 10 cm height through a fine stainless steel needle connected to an infusion syringe pump and its interaction with the surface of the som and fom was video recorded and analyzed from a broad view both membrane surfaces showed both repelling and slipping self cleaning effects with water droplets as discussed previously however the high speed video recording allowed the capture of the first moments of liquid interaction with the surface the fom showed high water repelling behavior characterized by its minimized adhesion and fast droplet bouncing effect upon first interaction with the surface with a complete droplet touching deforming and bouncing from the surface within 26 ms ms fig 6 a 1 7 after complete surface detachment the same departed droplet had another round of complete bouncing within 18 6 ms fig 6a 9 12 with the elimination of surface macro corrugation such behavior by the fom is primarily a result of the nano patterns formed by the sinps and the consequent air entrapment here most of the droplet area hitting the surface would be interacting with air as discussed above and a bouncing effect is accordingly captured supplementary information video v3 on the other hand the som with surface macro corrugations showed simultaneous bouncing repelling and slipping effects with slipperiness being more pronounced upon first interaction with the falling water droplet supplementary information video v4 and video v5 in one sample the falling droplet impinged on the membrane surface was deformed bounced and split into two smaller droplets both of which slipped on the surface moving at different directions while bouncing fig 6b 1 10 in a different som sample the droplet movement due to surface slipperiness was clearly observed fig 6c 1 7 3 3 dcmd wetting performance using high salinity and low surface tension wastewater to evaluate their wetting resistance all three membranes were tested under the same conditions in dcmd experiment with a 1 m nacl feed solution spiked with different sds concentrations to induce membrane wetting sds is an anionic surfactant with an amphiphilic nature that decreases the surface tension of liquids sds is used in different industries especially in pharmaceutical food cleaning and hygiene products and thus could be found in many industrial wastewaters sds was dosed at the point of time zero which corresponds to the time when initial steady state operating parameters were obtained this occurred 1 5 h after the start of the test during which the feed consisted of the saline water only without sds at point zero sds was added step wise to the feed every 1 5 h the feed solution was replenished when necessary to maintain constant salinity and sds concentration the normalized flux and salt rejection for the commercial scm and som membranes are shown in fig 7 the commercial membrane showed immediate deterioration in permeate quality associated with a steep increase in flux when the sds concentration was first increased from 0 to 0 1 mm fig 7 this shows poor wetting resistance of the unmodified pvdf membrane to low surface tension contaminants in the feed the presence of sds breaks the strong cohesive forces between the water molecules reducing the surface tension of the feed and consequently the membrane s lep to a point where the commercial membrane pores were flooded autopsy of the commercial membrane after the dcmd test shows clear pore wetting of the membrane as evidenced by its diaphanous appearance the 0 1 mm sds concentration however was not enough to wet neither scm nor som fig 7 the superhydrophobicity of both membranes as a result of their low surface energy granted them a higher wetting threshold than the commercial membrane stable performance in terms of water flux and salt rejection was recorded for both membranes up to the point where the concentration of sds in the feed reached 0 5 mm at that point wetting of the scm occurred evidenced by an increase in permeate water flux combined with a decrease in salt rejection in contrast the som was still demonstrating stable operation even after the concentration of sds in the feed was increased to 1 0 mm post mortem inspection of the membrane surface revealed a clean surface with no apparent pore wetting the complete salt rejection and stable water flux of the som over approximately 12 h of dcmd testing using 0 1 mm sds concentrations is a result of its hierarchically structured design the combination of macro corrugations micro morphology and nano patterns with a stable fluorinated sinps coating resulted in a robust som membrane that is able to sustain a stable cassie baxter state for a prolonged period under challenging conditions in this case the transition of the som from its stable cassie baxter state to the wenzel state was unfavorable as the system must overcome a high energy barrier for such a transition to happen maintaining a cassie baxter state is attributed to the re entrant hierarchically structure of the som membrane that also results in an omniphobic property to explain such an observation a schematic illustration of the som solid liquid air interface is presented in fig 8 the 2nd and 3rd levels of the som re entrant structure are achieved by the micro sized morphology of the membrane matrix pvdf spherulites fibers fig 8a and the nano sized spherical sinps fig 8b in a patterned textured surface the direction of capillary force i e the net traction on the liquid air interface as shown by the arrow in fig 8c is dependent on the pattern geometry i e the local geometrical angle of the pattern tuteja et al 2008 and for maintaining a cassie baxter state should be facing upward towards the de wetting direction the spherical shape of the sinps presents an ideal match for this requirement as it directed the net force upward and accordingly lifted the liquid air interface to the top of the sinp sphere creating an air gap with a height h fig 8c between the liquid and the solid which is also a requirement for maintain cassie baxter state i e h 0 boo et al 2016b the angle between the capillary force arrow and the surface curvature as represented by ɵ in fig 8c i e a tangent at the sinps water interface that intersect the capillary force direction is nothing but the intrinsic equilibrium ca of the solid vapor liquid interface of a smooth flat and non permeable surface of the same material which was earlier reported as ɵ in fig 5c if ɵ 90 for som ɵ was measured to be equal to 93 27 the liquid air interface is situated at the upper half of the sinps where a convex curvature occurs i e above the dashed line in fig 8c surfaces that show ɵ 90 but with re entrant structure can still maintain a cassie baxter state with the liquid air interface moving down into the bottom half of the sphere close to the solid surface but maintain an air gap with h 0 tuteja et al 2007 however one would expect that surfaces which show very low values of ɵ are not able to maintain an air gap and as a result wet the solid surface leading to a transition into the wenzel state the increased levels of the re entrant structure for the som i e 3 levels with two being at the micro and nano size achieves a higher air gap with a height for the som higher than that of membranes with single level re entrant structure such as electrospun fibres and as a result higher energy barrier for a transition into the wenzel wetting state i e more stable and robust in maintaining a cassie baxter state for validation of the above explanation the wetting state for the som was mathematically identified by calculating the wetting state factor ζ the wetting state factor represents the ratio between liquid air sagging depth represented by s in fig 8c and the pattern geometry height represented by d in fig 8c ζ has been recently reported in literature as a measurement for the wetting state factor of patterned surfaces grewal et al 2014 xiao et al 2019a and is given by 3 ζ 2 s f 2 a r tan θ a β where sf is the spacing factor p d ar is the aspect ratio height to diameter ratio i e d d for the sinps shape of the som and ɵa and β are the advancing contact angle and interior angle respectively previous evaluation of ζ for different topographies including cylindrical patterns with different geometrical parameters dome shaped patterns mushroom patterns as well as hierarchical micro and nano scale patterns which all showed similar limiting values with ζ 0 5 representing surfaces in a cassie baxter state suspended state ζ 0 75 representing surfaces in wenzel state pinned state and a metastable or transition state at 0 5 ζ 0 75 grewal et al 2014 nosonovsky and bhushan 2007 considering the size of the used commercial sinps in this study with diameter of 12 nm and by analysing the sem images of the som and referring to fig 8c the values of p and d are 18 and 12 nm respectively ɵa was measured using the same drop shape analyzer by advancing a liquid droplet and recording the highest measured ca which was found to be equal to 162 89 1 8 the interior angle β for the sinp sphere shape is 90 fig 8c accordingly ζ was calculated to be equal to 0 41 0 5 for the som confirming its cassie baxter state the calculated low wetting state factor for the som suggests a low liquid air sagging depth as illustrated in fig 8c according to equation 3 a lower ɵa for the scm would yield a higher sagging depth and accordingly moving closer to the transition state of wetting 3 4 dcmd fouling performance using high salinity and low surface tension oily wastewater in these experiments the membranes were tested with a saline oil in water emulsion composed of a 1 m nacl 0 05 mm sds aqueous feed spiked with different oil concentrations to represent challenging oily wastewaters where both surfactants and oils could be simultaneously present oil was dosed at the point of time zero which correspond to the time when initial steady state operating parameters were obtained this occurred 1 h after the start of the test during which the feed consisted of saline water containing 0 05 mm sds alone without any oil addition after that the 1 v v oil in water emulsion was added step wise to the feed every 2 h yielding oil concentrations in the feed of 50 100 200 and 400 ppm after the four consecutive oil additions the feed solution was continuously inspected and replenished when necessary to maintain constant salinity sds and oil concentration the normalized flux and salt rejection for the commercial scm and som membranes are shown in fig 9 the hydrophobic commercial membrane rapidly fouled upon the first oil addition i e at oil concentration of 50 ppm fig 9a the water flux gradually diminished and dropped to zero within 2 h of operation however the salt rejection was not affected suggesting that membrane fouling by oil not wetting was dominant after that the commercial experiment was allowed to continue for one more hour up to a total experiment time of 4 h during that time the flux remained zero and the sr remained constant the oil molecules being hydrophobic easily attached to and fouled the hydrophobic commercial membrane surface due to strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions in this case oil foulants did not only cover the membrane surface but also wicked into the pores blocking them and subsequently preventing vapor transfer and diminishing membrane flux this could be clearly seen from the post mortem membrane images where the membrane surface facing the feed was completely covered with oil stains figs 9b 2 while small areas on the bottom membrane surface i e facing the permeate were also fouled with what seemed to be oil which had wicked through the membrane pores figs 9b 3 both scm and som on the other hand demonstrated stable md operation during the first step of oil addition nevertheless when the oil concentration in the feed was increased to 100 ppm the scm experienced a small decrease in flux likely due to oil fouling within 2 h of operation at 100 ppm oil concertation the scm flux decreased by 25 of its initial value which was also accompanied by a slight reduction in its salt rejection sr fig 9a this decrease in sr is a sign of partial pore wetting which could be attributed to the absorbed surfactants on the oil surface suggesting that both fouling and partial wetting simultaneously occurred further addition of oil to a concentration of 200 ppm caused a significant deterioration in the scm s performance within 2 h the flux increased by approximately 3 folds of its initial value while the sr dropped to less than 40 suggesting wetting dominance rezaei et al 2018 mainly attributed fouling to membrane wetting in md while macro corrugations limited oil fouling in the case of scm to 25 flux decline as mentioned the scm could not resist the surfactant wetting induced by oil at high concentrations when both oil the foulant and sds surfactant the wetting agent are present in the feed wetting is expected to happen through two different mechanisms or the combination thereof huang et al 2016 the first mechanism is by bounding the oil soluble hydrophobic tails of the surfactants to the hydrophobic oil that is absorbed on the surface of the membrane pores the second mechanism is by bounding the hydrophobic tails of the surfactants to the membrane pores while its hydrophilic heads are in the water forming a bridge for the feed to permeate through the membrane wang and lin 2017 accordingly with such feeds as the one used in our experiment i e oil in water with surfactants the changes in flux and permeate quality could be used as indicators of which mechanism was dominant for pore wetting decreased permeate quality accompanied by flux decline is proof of both wetting and fouling which makes it more likely for the wetting to be induced because of the absorbed surfactants on the oil surface the first mechanism this was likely the case for the scm at 100 ppm oil concentration where both fouling and wetting were noticed with the former being more prevalent but still controlled thanks to the macro corrugations however a decreased salt rejection with flux increase or even with no change in flux would likely mean that wetting is mainly at play the second mechanism either by surfactants bounding to the membrane pores oil induced wetting bonding of the surfactant s hydrophobic tail to the hydrophobic oil that is absorbed on the surface of the membrane pores or the combination thereof this was likely the case for the scm at the 200 ppm oil concentration where the membrane experienced apparent and total membrane wetting nevertheless the exact mechanism or combination of mechanisms is difficult to determine and more experimentation would be required images of the scm after the test clearly show complete surface wetting with small areas being fouled by oil stains figs 9b 5 while feed penetration could also be spotted at the permeate side figs 9b 6 on the contrary the som maintained stable dcmd operation even at a high oil concentration of 400 ppm showing complete sr and enduring relatively stable water flux throughout the whole experiment time fig 9a moreover testing the som for an extended time period of 24 h with both feeds 1 m nacl with varying sds concentrations and 1 m nacl with 0 05 mm sds and varying oil concentrations still showed relatively stable dcmd performance confirming its robustness supplementary information fig s3 inspections of the som samples after the long term wetting and fouling md tests showed relatively clean membrane surfaces with minimal foulants deposition and the stability of sinps coating was confirmed by ca measurements of the used som supplementary information fig s3 the high cas measured after md testing of the som indicates its low adhesion to the used low surface tension feeds which was also confirmed by its very low sliding angle such robust operation for the som is a result of the developed hierarchical structure and stable sinps coating while the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between the membrane and oil might still exist for the som the propensity to wetting is highly minimized due to the effects of macro corrugations being more pronounced in this case instead of chemically breaking the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction by developing a hydrophilic layer on the membrane surface as attempted by other researchers huang et al 2017 c li et al 2019 wang et al 2016b breaking this interaction physically through the development of surface corrugations was herein adopted the local turbulence and hydrodynamic shear force developed by surface macro corrugations can minimize oil adhesion on the surface and prevent its accumulation leading to relatively small chances for oil fouling moreover the superomniphobicity of the som ensures oil induced wetting by surfactants bonding to the oil prevention in contrast to the commercial and scm membranes where wetting could be induced by oil due to the lack of omniphobicity and thus surfactant penetration the after test images of the som revealed a relatively clean surface on the feed side with minimal oil stains figs 9b 8 and a clean surface on the permeate side suggesting no wetting or oil penetration fig 9b 9 the slippery theory defined earlier also showed a good correlation between fouling scaling and the wetting state of the membrane xiao et al 2020 the slippery surface of the som is attributed by a suspended wetting state wetting state factor ζ 0 5 as explained earlier resulting from its dual scale roughness and ultrahigh ca where the liquid droplet is suspended on the sinps figs 5d and 8c during md testing such a suspended wetting state and the associated slippery surface significantly lowered scaling and fouling by reducing the direct contact between foulants and the som surface 4 conclusions the full implementation of md for treatment of low surface tension industrial oily wastewaters is still hindered mainly due to major membrane issues such as wetting and fouling in this study we fabricated a superomniphobic membrane with a carefully designed hierarchical structure comprising macro micro and nano reentrant curvatures and investigated its performance against one commercial and one fabricated superhydrophobic corrugated membranes different low surface tension contaminants which are usually found in industrial wastewater streams were used in the tests we captured the first moment of interaction between a liquid droplet and the membrane surfaces to better understand their behavior when in contact with challenging feeds while the hydrophobic commercial membrane and our fabricated superhydrophobic corrugated membrane showed deteriorated performance due to the oil and surfactant in the water a mixture of both contaminants presented an even more complicated feed and changed how the same membranes performed suggesting performance deterioration could be attributed to different mechanisms when tested with saline solution contaminated with sds surfactant both the commercial and fabricated superhydrophobic membranes suffered from full wetting at different sds concentrations moreover testing with saline oil in water emulsion stabilized by sds showed severe fouling for the commercial hydrophobic membrane and partial fouling followed by wetting for the superhydrophobic membrane the combination of partial fouling and full wetting for the superhydrophobic membrane is due to the complicated sds attachment mechanism either to the hydrophobic oil the hydrophobic membrane surface or the combination of both the superomniphobic membrane on the other hand outperformed the other membranes as a result of its hierarchical design and the subsequent very high liquid air interface fraction resisting both wetting and fouling and showing stable md performance with complicated feeds at high concentrations of low surface tension surfactant and oil and for extended operation time oil and sds were both unable to wick through the membrane pores due to its omniphobic anti wetting nature similarly the hydrophobic oil present in the feed was unable to attach to the membrane surface declaration of

18049,a hierarchically assembled superomniphobic membrane with three levels of reentrant structure was designed and fabricated to enable effective treatment of low surface tension hypersaline oily wastewaters using direct contact membrane distillation dcmd the overall structure is a combination of macro corrugations obtained by surface imprinting with the micro spherulites morphology achieved through the applied phase inversion method and nano patterns obtained by fluorinated silica nanoparticles sinps coating this resulted in a superomniphobic membrane surface with remarkable anti wetting properties repelling both high surface tension water and low surface tension oils measurements of contact angle ca with di water an anionic surfactant oil and ethanol demonstrated a robust wetting resistance against low surface tension liquids showing both superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity ca values of 160 8 2 3 and 154 3 1 9 for water and oil were obtained respectively calculations revealed a high liquid vapor interface for the fabricated membrane with more than 89 of the water droplet contact area being with air pockets entrapped between adjacent sinps and only 11 come into contact with the solid membrane surface moreover the high liquid vapor interface imparts the membrane with high liquid repellency self cleaning and slippery effects characterized by a minimum droplet

their adverse impacts on the environment and water bodies jamaly et al 2015 tanudjaja et al 2019 membrane distillation md a membrane based technology that utilizes low grade thermal energy waste heat or solar energy offers a viable option for treatment of industrial wastewaters an et al 2016 deka et al 2019b duong et al 2016 gryta et al 2001 huang et al 2017 tong and elimelech 2016 this is because md is not affected by the feed salt concentration and can achieve a theoretical 100 solute rejection with hypersaline feeds boo et al 2016a zheng et al 2018 however when treating feeds containing organic and low surface tension contaminants such as oils and surfactants wetting and fouling of traditional md membranes become inevitable leading to reduced vapor flux poor permeate quality and decreased energy efficiency restraining md s implementation for industrial wastewater reclamation boo et al 2016a lu et al 2019 wang et al 2016b low surface tension contaminants represent the primary cause for wetting in md particularly when treating challenging hypersaline and oily wastewaters deka et al 2019a rezaei et al 2018 in recent years superhydrophobic and omniphobic membranes gained substantial interest due to their ability to minimize the problems of wetting and fouling in md even when dealing with challenging wastewaters contaminated with low surface tension material chen et al 2018b j lee et al 2016 lin et al 2014 woo et al 2018 superhydrophobic membranes which are defined as membranes with a static water contact angle caw higher than 150 han et al 2012 were first developed to improve the fouling and wetting resistance of membranes lu et al 2017 meng et al 2015 2014 tian et al 2015a these membranes are inspired by the superhydrophobic self cleaning properties of the natural lotus leaf surface known as the lotus effect barthlott and neinhuis 1997 thereafter mimicking nature has inspired researchers to develop similar bio inspired superhydrophobic surfaces ahmmed et al 2017 das et al 2018 ghasemlou et al 2019 liu et al 2010 in doing so both surface chemistry and morphology are tackled hensel et al 2016 which particularly involve 1 lowering the membrane s surface energy by chemical modification through surface fluorination and silanisation figoli et al 2017 liu et al 2016 tian et al 2015a and 2 increasing surface roughness by different techniques such as electrospinning and electrospraying deka et al 2019b woo et al 2016 etching qian and shen 2005 and coating si and guo 2015 however and despite their improved wetting resistance lotus inspired superhydrophobic membranes still have limitations such as their low durability and insufficient repellence of low surface tension liquids hensel et al 2016 for instance superhydrophobic membranes are vulnerable to surfactants wetting si and guo 2015 to address these limitations omniphobic superomniphobic membranes being both hydrophobic superhydrophobic and oleophobic superoleophobic have been recently reported to mitigate membrane wetting salimi 2019 siyal et al 2019 of both high and low surface tension liquids including polar solvents e g toluene diiodomethane and non polar alkanes and

omniphobic membranes lu et al 2019 springtails a modern hexapod have the ability to breathe through their cuticle surface regardless of if it s under water oil or other liquids boban et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 the omniphobic property of the springtail s surface has been found to be due to its cuticle re entrant structure and a low surface energy lipids layer hensel et al 2016 for designing an omniphobic membrane that is repellent to not only high surface tension water but also low surface tension oils it is well agreed that a combination of both hierarchical re entrant surface curvature and the use of membrane materials of low surface energy or surface modification using such materials such as fluoropolymers and hydrocarbons mimicking springtail is needed chu and seeger 2014 various successful attempts to fabricate omniphobic membranes for md of low surface tension and oily wastewater feeds have been reported boo et al 2016b boo et al 2016a chen et al 2018a 2018b deka et al 2019a

water and polar and non polar low surface tension solvents chu and seeger 2014 an early study from 2007 on the design of superomniphobic surfaces reported a re entrant surface curvature design combined with membrane chemistry and rough textured surface tuteja et al 2007 in 2014 an omniphobic md membrane was fabricated by coating a hydrophilic glass fiber membrane with silica nanoparticles sinps to develop a re entrant structure followed by surface fluorination to lower the membrane surface energy lin et al 2014 the developed membrane showed a high ca of 140 and 110 for water and mineral oil respectively but below 90 for polar ethanol and non polar decane on another front corrugation or patterning as a physical modification of membrane surface topography have been applied to enhance the fouling and scaling resistance of membranes including in md armbruster et al 2018 choi et al 2017 ding et al 2017 kharraz et al 2015b 2015a kochkodan et al 2014 pawlowski et al 2019 2016 wiese et al 2019 won et al 2012 2016 xiao et al 2019b xie et al 2017 corrugated membranes were found to improve flux stabilization when tested with seawater and concentrated brine in dcmd kharraz et al 2015a the aforementioned studies attributed the enhanced fouling resistance of corrugated membranes to the improved feed hydrodynamics introduced by surface patterns however surface corrugations in md mainly improve flux and reduce fouling but do not reduce wetting by high or low surface tension liquids in a previous study kharraz and an 2019 we reported the fabrication of a superhydrophobic patterned membrane spm by combining macro surface patterns with surface fluorination to reduce the membrane s surface energy the combined physical and chemical modifications resulted in an spm with a high water ca of 155 we proved the advantage of surface patterns in inducing favorable flow hydrodynamics that increased surface area and highly enhanced fouling resistance when tested in extended md experiments with real seawater feed moreover the superhydrophobicity of spms resulted in an improved wetting resistance with a stable flux and salt rejection when the feed seawater was spiked with up to 0 4 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate sds however further addition of sds lowered the feed s surface tension to a limit that overcame the energy barrier for a transition from the metastable cassie state to the complete wetting of the wenzel state and consequently wetting was observed at 0 5 mm sds the spm wetting resistance was tested with low surface tension sds but not with non polar solvents such as oils building on our spm work in this study we report on a macro corrugated and nano patterned superomniphobic membrane som that can sustain the metastable cassie state even with non polar low surface tension oils instead of chemically breaking the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction by developing a hydrophilic layer that involves the usage of harmful chemicals with concerning environmental effects on the membrane surface as attempted by other researchers to tackle membrane fouling huang et al 2017 wang et al 2016a zhao et al 2013 breaking this interaction physically through the development of surface corrugations was herein adopted the macro corrugations are expected to improve fouling resistance while the nano patterns resulting from sinps deposition along with surface fluorination create a re entrant structure to reduce surface energy as a result a hierarchically structured som was created with improved wetting resistance to both high and low surface tension liquids the fabricated superomniphobic membrane was characterized and tested in low surface tension oily wastewater treatment in a dcmd system 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf

hereinafter referred to as commercial with a nominal pore size of 0 22 μm and thickness of 119 μm gvhp durapore was purchased from merck millipore and used for benchmarking 2 2 design of the superomniphobic membrane and reference membranes a negatively charged macro corrugated membrane hereinafter referred to as cm was first fabricated through a modified phase inversion process as described in the next section the cm was further treated with naoh and aptes to render it positively charged and was then coated by a negatively charged sinps through electrostatic interaction followed by fluorination of the sinps through immersion in fas n hexane solution the resultant is macro corrugated and sinps patterned superomniphobic membrane som as illustrated in fig 1 as a benchmark two additioanl membranes were tested in dcmd experiments against the som s performance a commercial hydrophobic membrane and a fabricated superhydrophobic corrugated membrane hereinafter referred to as scm the fabrication of the scm followed the same chemical treatment procedure as for the som i e treatment with naoh and aptes except that the surface was then fluorinated without sinps deposition 2 3 fabrication of the macro corrugated membrane the cm is comprised of two layers and was fabricated through a combination of non solvent induced phase separation nips and vapor induced phase separation vips techniques for the first and second layers respectively the cm was fabricated in two layers because introducing a spacer imprinting step to form the corrugations as discussed below into the fabrication of a single layer membrane resulted in large pores not suitable for md application nips was used for fabrication of the first layer to achieve a small mean pore size and a controlled pore size distribution while vips was used for fabrication of the second layer to form macro corrugations and achieve desirable hydrophobicity and roughness the cm was used as a base layer for the scm and som membranes an illustration of the cm fabrication procedure is presented in fig 2 with additional details included in our previous study kharraz and an 2019 briefly 12 wt pvdf solution in dmac was stirred at 60 c until the pvdf was completely dissolved and then left overnight to de gas the prepared solution was then cast on the pp support at a casting thickness of 200 μm followed by immediate immersion into deionized di water coagulation bath for 40 min then drying in ambient air overnight a second layer of 10 wt pvdf in dmac was cast at a casting thickness of 200 μm on top of the first layer while the second layer is still liquid a diamond shaped net spacer was used to make an imprint on top of the layer and its imprinting depth was fixed to 0 7 mm the spacer string thickness this was followed by 5 min exposure to 80 relative humidity rh then immersion in a di water coagulation bath after 1 min inside the bath the spacer was manually delaminated from the nascent membrane and the latter was left in the bath for 40 min followed by overnight drying in ambient air the resultant membrane appeared as negatively charged over the investigated 3 9 ph range 2 4 sinps deposition and surface fluorination to deposit the negatively charged sinps and subsequently apply fluorination on the membrane surface the negatively charged cm had to be first activated and made positively charged to do so the cm was wetted with ethanol and alkaline treated by immersion into a 7 5 m naoh aqueous solution at 70 c for 3 h to functionalize the surface with the necessary hydroxyl groups alkaline treated cm after that the membrane was immersed into a 3 v v aptes ethanol at 60 c for 1 h to functionalize the surface with amine groups which resulted in a positively charged cm amino functionalized cm the wetted positively charged cm was then immersed into a 0 03 wt sinps suspension prepared in a ph 6 acetate buffer for 1 h to reinforce an electrostatic attraction between the positively charged cm and the negatively charged sinps yielding an sinps patterned cm the membrane was then washed with acetate buffer and di water and dried at 80 c lastly the sinps were fluorinated by immersing the sinps patterned cm into a 1 v v fas n hexane at 60 c for 24 h where a hydrolysis reaction between the silica surface and fas resulted in an som with highly reduced surface energy the scm was achieved following the same procedure as described above but the surface was fluorinated without including the sinps deposition step i e the cm alkaline treated by naoh amino functionalized by aptes and surface fluorinated by fas 2 5 membrane characterization the surface morphology of the modified membranes was characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscopy

membrane samples was measured using an in house assembled gas liquid displacement setup supplementary information method s2 the zeta potential ζ potential of the membrane surface was measured based on the streaming current technique using a streaming potential analyzer surpass anton paar austria equipped with an adjustable gap cell 1 mm potassium chloride kcl solutions were used as the control electrolyte to perform measurements and adjusted with potassium hydroxide koh and hydrochloric acid hcl at each ph value the ζ potential of the sinps was measured using a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano malvern panalytical ltd with a range of ph values adjusted using acidic 0 1 m hcl and basic 0 1 m naoh solutions the samples were then placed in a pre rinsed folded capillary cell and the zeta potential values were measured the stability of the sinps coating was evaluated by measuring and comparing the ca of the som before and after exposure to physical and chemical stresses the physical stress included placing the som membrane in a sonication bath for 20 min while the chemical stress included immersion in highly acidic hcl ph 2 and highly basic naoh ph 12 solutions for 20 min the surface wetting properties of the membranes were evaluated through measurement of ca with liquids of different surface tension γ values including water γ 72 8 mn m 1 5 mm sds solution γ 34 9 mn m 1 vegetable oil γ 32 2 mn m 1 and ethanol γ 22 1 mn m 1 using a drop shape analyzer dsa25 kruss germany a 3 μl liquid droplet was used to measure the ca at 3 locations at least and for 3 different samples of each membrane the average ca value was reported the sliding angle sa of all membranes was measured by fixing a membrane sample on a glass slide using double sided tape and placing a 4 μl droplet of di water on the membrane surface the glass slide was then manually tilted and the tilt angle at which the water droplet started rolling off the membrane surface was recorded as the sliding angle the fractions of liquid solid fs i e water droplet in contact with the solid membrane surface and liquid gas fg i e water droplet in contact with entrapped air interfaces of the membranes were calculated based on the cassie baxter mode equation 1 cos θ f s cos θ f g cos θ g where ɵ is the measured or apparent contact angle ɵ and ɵg are the equilibrium contact angles of the liquid droplet on solid and gas respectively ɵg is usually approximated as 180 because of the low gas liquid molecules adhesion lu et al 2019 while fs fg 1 resulting in equation 1 to be simplified as 2 cos θ 1 f s 1 cos θ the intrinsic contact angle ɵ in equations 1 and 2 is that of the solid vapor liquid interface on surfaces that are non permeable chemically homogeneous and atomically smooth chu and seeger 2014 thus for the fabricated scm and som to measure ɵ a smooth flat and non permeable surface was obtained by melting the membrane that was fabricated using the same procedure as scm or som but without corrugations through heat pressing at 185 c for 5 min for the commercial membrane ɵ was measured after heat pressing the same membrane at 170 c for 5 min the first interaction of a water droplet with the som surface bouncing or slipping effect was analyzed by dropping a freely flowing water droplet from an accurate needle connected to a dual syringe infusion pump kds 200p kdscientific a high speed camera system memrecam hx 6e nac image technology with a frame rate of 5000 frame s was used to monitor and record the water contact behavior with the membrane surface for comparison the water droplet interaction with a flat surface omniphobic membrane fom fabricated the same way as the som but without surface corrugations was also analyzed 2 6 membrane distillation performance tests dcmd experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the commercial scm and som membranes with feed and permeate temperatures maintained at 60 and 20 c respectively the cumulative mass and conductivity of the permeate were constantly recorded and later used for calculations of water flux and salt rejection respectively a schematic diagram of the dcmd setup with details on operational parameters can be found in supplementary information fig s1 dcmd wetting and fouling experiments were performed by adding either sds surfactant as a wetting promoter or oil as a foulant to the saline feed feed and permeate flow rates for all md experiments were set at 400 and 200 ml min 1 respectively the dcmd performance of all three membranes commercial scm and som was then compared for the wetting experiments a low surface tension amphiphilic surfactant sds was incrementally added to a 1 m nacl feed solution to reduce the feed s surface tension and promote membrane wetting higher flowrate was applied on the feed side 400 ml min 1 in order to create a greater hydraulic pressure for the feed stream than that of the permeate stream 200 ml min 1 facilitating easier detection of membrane wetting as an increase in both water flux and permeate conductivity would be a sign of wetting occurrence the concentrations of sds used in these tests were 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 1 0 mm in fouling experiments vegetable oil a surrogate for a low surface tension foulant was used to prepare 1 v v oil in water emulsion under overnight strenuous mixing which was incrementally added to a 1 m nacl 0 05 mm sds feed solution as the dcmd feed the inclusion of sds in this oily feed was to mimic challenging wastewaters where both foulants and surfactants are presented and to test the membrane s behavior under these conditions the concentrations of oil used in these tests were 50 100 200 and 400 ppm 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and surface properties of the superomniphobic membrane the combination of nips and vips processes during the fabrication of the first and second layers of the corrugated membranes respectively has been chosen to control the pore size hydrophobicity roughness as well as to achieve the desired properties for a good base membrane as described in detail in our previous study kharraz and an 2019 while nips was used in fabricating the first layer mainly to control the pore size vips was used in fabricating the second layer because it results in membranes having an open porous structure and higher roughness surfaces with high ca and hydrophobicity peng et al 2012 tian et al 2015b showed that the water ca of membranes is closely related to the membrane surface morphology in which a higher water ca i e higher hydrophobicity is associated with a more open surface morphology in our study the applied relative humidity i e 80 and exposure time i e 5 min of the vips process for fabricating the second layer were selected in such a way to maximize the surface hydrophobicity and roughness the net spacer figs 3a 1 imprinting step resulted in the first macro level of the hierarchical structure that appeared as macro corrugations figs 3a 2 these macro corrugations are expected to increase the membrane surface area and promote flow turbulence near the surface which in return decreases the propensity for fouling kharraz et al 2015b won et al 2012 the extent of increase in surface area and decrease in fouling propensity were shown to be dependent on the shape of the spacer used based on our preliminary testing with different spacers which had different shapes and dimensions the net spacer used in this study was selected as it demonstrated the highest increase in surface area and lowest fouling propensity surface area of the cm membrane was increased by 42 compared to the commercial membrane i e flat membrane which was estimated by simple approximate calculations assuming a flat surface for the commercial membrane and a flat surface mounted by channel shape corrugations for the cm the dimensions and height of the channel shape corrugations were manually measured by a caliper and shown in figs 3a 2 the applied exposure to humidity during the vips step resulted in a rough and open surface morphology for the virgin cm fig 3a 3 the morphology shows the dominant presence of pvdf crystals spherulites as a result of a slower vapor uptake rate when pre exposed to humidity before immersion in the water bath giving the pvdf crystal nuclei time to grow radially and form such spherulites almarzooqi et al 2017 the micrometer sized pvdf spherulites constituted a micro level second step of the hierarchical structure when the amine functionalized cm was immersed in sinps suspension electrostatic attraction between the positively charged cm and negatively charged sinps promoted the deposition and coating of the sinps onto the surface of the cm fig 3a 4 shows the som completely covered with sinps while the inset shows the uniform distribution of sinps on an individual pvdf string the spherical geometry of the sinps provides the necessary re entrant structure boo et al 2016a and contributed to the formation of a nano level the third step of the hierarchical structure yielding a superomniphobic membrane som fig 3b shows the measured ζ potential values as a function of ph the virgin cm appeared as negatively charged throughout the whole tested ph range although pvdf does not show particular surface charge previous studies attributed this negative charge to the possible adsorption of cl and oh anions from the background electrolyte boo et al 2016a j lee et al 2016 when alkaline treated with a 7 5 m naoh solution the pvdf polymer of the cm was decorated with hydroxyl functional groups resulting in a hydrophilic surface and consequently showed more negative ζ potential over the whole ph range the membrane was then immersed in 3 v v aptes ethanol solution in which it reacted with the hydroxyl groups through hydrolysis and condensation the amine functionalized cm showed increased ζ potential value rendering it positively charged at ph values lower than 6 8 the sinps suspension showed negative ζ potential values within the ph range tested and accordingly an acetate buffer with ph 6 was chosen to act as the medium for the sinps suspension at which the amine functionalized cm is positively charged facilitating the electrostatic attraction of the sinps although zeta potential was not measured for the fabricated som but rather used as a characterization technique to decide at what ph the sinps suspension should be prepared to facilitate their electrostatic interaction with the positively charged amino functionalized cm it should be pointed out that previous studies showed the effect of membrane charge on membrane fouling and wetting an et al 2016 chen et al 2017 guo et al 2018 for instance testing of two negatively charged pvdf commercial membranes one being virgin while the other is modified to be superhydrophobic in dcmd using cationic anionic surfactant emulsified oil in water emulsions revealed severe membrane wetting for the virgin membrane with both surfactant emulsified emulsions on the other hand the superhydrophobic membrane showed a stable md performance when tested with the anionic surfactant emulsified emulsion but experienced severe membrane wetting with the cationic surfactant chen et al 2017 the presence of sinps coating as well as the subsequent fluorination was further confirmed by examining the ftir spectra of the cm sinps coated cm and som fig 3c shows the 800 1400 cm 1 wide view of the ftir spectra that covers the characteristic absorbances of the distinct functional groups a new peak at 1110 cm 1 that corresponds to the silanol groups on the sinps boo et al 2016a was observed after the amine functionalized cm was immersed and coated with sinps additionally after the cm was immersed in 1 v v fas n hexane a noticeable rise in absorbance intensity at 1140 cm 1 was observed which is a result of the cf2 symmetric stretching mode confirming successful surface fluorination boo et al 2016a in addition to the re entrant structure provided by the spherical sinps surface fluorination resulted in lower membrane surface energy ultimately achieving a superomniphobic surface all three membranes i e commercial scm and som show a narrow psd within the range that is favorable for md khayet and matsuura 2011 after sinps coating the som showed a reduction in mps 0 199 0 032 compared to the scm 0 224 0 023 which was mainly attributed to the sinps coating partially blocking some surface pores supplementary information fig s2 a summary of membrane properties is presented in table s1 supplementary information both scm and som showed relatively similar porosities 62 1 2 23 and 61 3 2 64 respectively to that of the commercial membrane 66 8 1 13 on the other hand thanks to their smaller pore size and higher hydrophobicity resulting from surface and sinps fluorination that led to reduced surface energy the scm and som showed 62 3 28 0 12 bars and 84 3 73 0 16 bars higher lep respectively than that of the commercial membrane 2 03 0 05 bars the first and second layers of the cm were each casted at a thickness of 200 μm however during solidification and gelation of the cast film in the coagulation bath as a result of the phase inversion mechanism the cast film experienced vertical shrinkage i e thickness reduction and thus the resulting membrane thickness was much thinner than that of the original cast film 183 2 2 and 185 2 6 μm for the scm and som respectively the trade off between mass and heat transfer resistances of md membranes was considered and casting thickness was chosen accordingly after a few trials in a way which would yield a membrane with a thickness in the range suitable for md application and comparable to that of the commercial membrane to allow for fair comparison 3 2 wetting properties and resistance of the superomniphobic membrane surface wetting properties of the commercial scm and som were characterized in terms of their contact angles with different liquids namely di water γ 72 8 mn m 1 5 mm sds γ 34 9 mn m 1 vegetable oil γ 32 2 mn m 1 and ethanol γ 22 1 mn m 1 the results are shown in fig 4 these particular liquids were chosen to evaluate the membranes wetting behavior with liquids of varying surface tensions as many industrial wastewater streams contain mixed and challenging wetting agents including both amphiphilic surfactants and hydrophobic oils the commercial membrane showed a hydrophobic interaction with water ca of 123 1 1 5 but a much lower contact angle with all the other three liquids while the membrane showed a relatively low and unstable ca with 5 mm sds 82 7 2 1 upon initial droplet contact and 70 5 1 6 3 min thereafter fig 4a and b both oil and ethanol completely wicked the commercial surface either within few seconds for oil or immediately for ethanol fig 4c the scm exhibited stable superhydrophobicity ca with water 152 4 2 3 due to its reduced surface energy as a result of surface fluorination it also demonstrated a wetting resistance to 5 mm sds high and stable ca of 143 1 1 9 but greater wetting propensity for both low surface tension liquids oil and ethanol in fact ethanol showed a very low ca of 23 6 2 0 upon droplet touch fig 4a but completely wicked the surface after a few minutes fig 4b and c the som on the other hand showed highly improved wetting resistance against all tested liquids superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity were achieved with water and oil having stable cas of 160 8 2 3 and 154 3 1 9 respectively while 5 mm sds and ethanol showed high and stable ca of 148 3 1 6 and 118 7 2 2 respectively although the measurement of ethanol ca after 3 min was not possible due to droplet evaporation it was still evident that none of the tested liquids was able to wick the som surface fig 4b and c the improved wetting resistance of the som surface against different high and low surface tension liquids is a result of a combination of hierarchical re entrant surface curvature and low membrane surface energy both of which are pre requisites for an omniphobic surface chu and seeger 2014 the low durability of the superhydrophobic nature of the membrane surfaces is a drawback hensel et al 2016 and one of the main reasons driving the development of omniphobic surfaces the durability of the nano patterns created by the sinps deposition on the som is critical to sustaining the cassie baxter state and the subsequent liquid repellency this durability mainly relies on the robustness of surface properties which in turn depends on the stability of sinps and fas coating to test this stability the som was subjected to physical and chemical stresses ca with the som for the same four liquids after these stresses were measured and compared to those with the som before being subjected to the stresses as shown in fig 4d immersion of the som in highly acidic and basic solutions or bath sonication for 20 min did not result in any significant change in the measured ca with any of the liquids water 5 mm sds oil and ethanol this observation confirms the presence of a stable cassie baxter state for the som as a result of robust sinps attachment and fas coating when the spherical sinps were attached to the membrane surface nano scale patterns were generated the gaps within these nano scale adjacent patterns are not easily filled by liquid but instead are filled with air that is trapped beneath the liquid in such a case the contact area between the liquid and the surface of the som is highly reduced resulting in very high ca values due to the repellence between the liquid and the hydrophobic air underneath it lu et al 2019 as evident in fig 5a1 2 both the commercial and the unmodified cm showed high adhesion to water droplets with no apparent repellency supplementary information video v1 the wetting behavior of the som in such a state falls under the cassie baxter regime the presence of nano patterns and the air entrapment as a result thereof maintain an energy barrier that is difficult to be overcome by the liquid even using low surface tension liquids such as oil and ethanol helbig et al 2011 additionally fluorination of sinps by fas coating contributted to the ultra low surface energy of the som such ultra low surface energy did not only contribute to the superhydrophobicity and surface repellence of the som but also yielded a self cleaning property i e slippery effect as shown in fig 5a3 4 see the video in supplementary information video v2 water droplets freely rolled on the som surface without any sticking mimicking the superhydrophobic and self cleaning surface of the lotus leaf where dust particles get attached to the freely rolling liquid droplets the solid vapor liquid interface in the case of scm and som follows a cassie baxter state which can be characterized by equation 2 as explained in section 2 5 based on that equation fig 5c shows an estimation of the area fractions of solid liquid and air liquid interfaces for all three membranes the area fraction of the solid liquid interface represents the fraction of the water droplet in contact with the solid membrane surface which had its highest value 0 789 for the commercial membrane followed by scm 0 620 and som 0 104 despite its hydrophobic nature the commercial membrane surface shows high adhesion to water droplets supplementary information video v1 with an area fraction of only 0 211 of a water droplet in contact with air fig 5c the introduction of macro corrugations resulted in a small increase of the liquid air fraction for the scm 0 380 however when coated with sinps the som showed a remarkable increase in the air liquid interface with approximately 89 6 of the water droplet area in contact with air fig 5c this high liquid air interface is attributed to the high amount of air entrapped between the adjacent sinps beneath the water droplet which was the main reason behind its superomniphobic surface property sliding angle measurements fig 5b showed good correlation with the estimated area fractions of the solid liquid and air liquid interfaces when a water droplet was placed on top of the commercial membrane surface the droplet was pinned to the surface and tilting the surface until it became perpendicular to the plane or even upside down still did not cause the droplet to roll off sa 90 such behavior was expected for the commercial membrane due to its large area fraction of the solid liquid interface the scm showed a much lower but relatively high sa of 22 4 3 2 due to its superhydrophobicity in contrast the som showed the lowest sa of 3 8 1 3 which also correlates to its high area fraction of the air liquid interface the ultralow sa of the som which is a result of the low surface free energy and the hierarchical structure created by dual scale roughness of micro morphology and sinps coating followed by fluorination is a direct cause for its slippery surface as explained below recent studies have introduced a slippery theory which relates a low sa to a slippery surface effect xiao et al 2020 2019a 2019b a surface with an sa higher than 90 such as the commercial membrane in our study is defined as a sticky surface causing a liquid to be non slip xiao et al 2019b this was the case for the commercial membrane where tilting the membrane surface at an angle of 90 or greater did not result in droplet slip off but rather the droplet was pinned to the surface for an sa lower than 10 a slippery surface was defined causing the liquid to float above the solid air interface xiao et al 2019b which is in good agreement with the slippery effect noticed for the som upon interaction with a falling water droplet as will be discussed in the following paragraph the scm had an sa of 22 4 away from the 90 limit of stickiness and was closer to the 10 limit of slipperiness accordingly moving its superhydrophobic surface more towards a slippery behavior to further understand the surface behavior a 5 μl water droplet was allowed to freely drop from 10 cm height through a fine stainless steel needle connected to an infusion syringe pump and its interaction with the surface of the som and fom was video recorded and analyzed from a broad view both membrane surfaces showed both repelling and slipping self cleaning effects with water droplets as discussed previously however the high speed video recording allowed the capture of the first moments of liquid interaction with the surface the fom showed high water repelling behavior characterized by its minimized adhesion and fast droplet bouncing effect upon first interaction with the surface with a complete droplet touching deforming and bouncing from the surface within 26 ms ms fig 6 a 1 7 after complete surface detachment the same departed droplet had another round of complete bouncing within 18 6 ms fig 6a 9 12 with the elimination of surface macro corrugation such behavior by the fom is primarily a result of the nano patterns formed by the sinps and the consequent air entrapment here most of the droplet area hitting the surface would be interacting with air as discussed above and a bouncing effect is accordingly captured supplementary information video v3 on the other hand the som with surface macro corrugations showed simultaneous bouncing repelling and slipping effects with slipperiness being more pronounced upon first interaction with the falling water droplet supplementary information video v4 and video v5 in one sample the falling droplet impinged on the membrane surface was deformed bounced and split into two smaller droplets both of which slipped on the surface moving at different directions while bouncing fig 6b 1 10 in a different som sample the droplet movement due to surface slipperiness was clearly observed fig 6c 1 7 3 3 dcmd wetting performance using high salinity and low surface tension wastewater to evaluate their wetting resistance all three membranes were tested under the same conditions in dcmd experiment with a 1 m nacl feed solution spiked with different sds concentrations to induce membrane wetting sds is an anionic surfactant with an amphiphilic nature that decreases the surface tension of liquids sds is used in different industries especially in pharmaceutical food cleaning and hygiene products and thus could be found in many industrial wastewaters sds was dosed at the point of time zero which corresponds to the time when initial steady state operating parameters were obtained this occurred 1 5 h after the start of the test during which the feed consisted of the saline water only without sds at point zero sds was added step wise to the feed every 1 5 h the feed solution was replenished when necessary to maintain constant salinity and sds concentration the normalized flux and salt rejection for the commercial scm and som membranes are shown in fig 7 the commercial membrane showed immediate deterioration in permeate quality associated with a steep increase in flux when the sds concentration was first increased from 0 to 0 1 mm fig 7 this shows poor wetting resistance of the unmodified pvdf membrane to low surface tension contaminants in the feed the presence of sds breaks the strong cohesive forces between the water molecules reducing the surface tension of the feed and consequently the membrane s lep to a point where the commercial membrane pores were flooded autopsy of the commercial membrane after the dcmd test shows clear pore wetting of the membrane as evidenced by its diaphanous appearance the 0 1 mm sds concentration however was not enough to wet neither scm nor som fig 7 the superhydrophobicity of both membranes as a result of their low surface energy granted them a higher wetting threshold than the commercial membrane stable performance in terms of water flux and salt rejection was recorded for both membranes up to the point where the concentration of sds in the feed reached 0 5 mm at that point wetting of the scm occurred evidenced by an increase in permeate water flux combined with a decrease in salt rejection in contrast the som was still demonstrating stable operation even after the concentration of sds in the feed was increased to 1 0 mm post mortem inspection of the membrane surface revealed a clean surface with no apparent pore wetting the complete salt rejection and stable water flux of the som over approximately 12 h of dcmd testing using 0 1 mm sds concentrations is a result of its hierarchically structured design the combination of macro corrugations micro morphology and nano patterns with a stable fluorinated sinps coating resulted in a robust som membrane that is able to sustain a stable cassie baxter state for a prolonged period under challenging conditions in this case the transition of the som from its stable cassie baxter state to the wenzel state was unfavorable as the system must overcome a high energy barrier for such a transition to happen maintaining a cassie baxter state is attributed to the re entrant hierarchically structure of the som membrane that also results in an omniphobic property to explain such an observation a schematic illustration of the som solid liquid air interface is presented in fig 8 the 2nd and 3rd levels of the som re entrant structure are achieved by the micro sized morphology of the membrane matrix pvdf spherulites fibers fig 8a and the nano sized spherical sinps fig 8b in a patterned textured surface the direction of capillary force i e the net traction on the liquid air interface as shown by the arrow in fig 8c is dependent on the pattern geometry i e the local geometrical angle of the pattern tuteja et al 2008 and for maintaining a cassie baxter state should be facing upward towards the de wetting direction the spherical shape of the sinps presents an ideal match for this requirement as it directed the net force upward and accordingly lifted the liquid air interface to the top of the sinp sphere creating an air gap with a height h fig 8c between the liquid and the solid which is also a requirement for maintain cassie baxter state i e h 0 boo et al 2016b the angle between the capillary force arrow and the surface curvature as represented by ɵ in fig 8c i e a tangent at the sinps water interface that intersect the capillary force direction is nothing but the intrinsic equilibrium ca of the solid vapor liquid interface of a smooth flat and non permeable surface of the same material which was earlier reported as ɵ in fig 5c if ɵ 90 for som ɵ was measured to be equal to 93 27 the liquid air interface is situated at the upper half of the sinps where a convex curvature occurs i e above the dashed line in fig 8c surfaces that show ɵ 90 but with re entrant structure can still maintain a cassie baxter state with the liquid air interface moving down into the bottom half of the sphere close to the solid surface but maintain an air gap with h 0 tuteja et al 2007 however one would expect that surfaces which show very low values of ɵ are not able to maintain an air gap and as a result wet the solid surface leading to a transition into the wenzel state the increased levels of the re entrant structure for the som i e 3 levels with two being at the micro and nano size achieves a higher air gap with a height for the som higher than that of membranes with single level re entrant structure such as electrospun fibres and as a result higher energy barrier for a transition into the wenzel wetting state i e more stable and robust in maintaining a cassie baxter state for validation of the above explanation the wetting state for the som was mathematically identified by calculating the wetting state factor ζ the wetting state factor represents the ratio between liquid air sagging depth represented by s in fig 8c and the pattern geometry height represented by d in fig 8c ζ has been recently reported in literature as a measurement for the wetting state factor of patterned surfaces grewal et al 2014 xiao et al 2019a and is given by 3 ζ 2 s f 2 a r tan θ a β where sf is the spacing factor p d ar is the aspect ratio height to diameter ratio i e d d for the sinps shape of the som and ɵa and β are the advancing contact angle and interior angle respectively previous evaluation of ζ for different topographies including cylindrical patterns with different geometrical parameters dome shaped patterns mushroom patterns as well as hierarchical micro and nano scale patterns which all showed similar limiting values with ζ 0 5 representing surfaces in a cassie baxter state suspended state ζ 0 75 representing surfaces in wenzel state pinned state and a metastable or transition state at 0 5 ζ 0 75 grewal et al 2014 nosonovsky and bhushan 2007 considering the size of the used commercial sinps in this study with diameter of 12 nm and by analysing the sem images of the som and referring to fig 8c the values of p and d are 18 and 12 nm respectively ɵa was measured using the same drop shape analyzer by advancing a liquid droplet and recording the highest measured ca which was found to be equal to 162 89 1 8 the interior angle β for the sinp sphere shape is 90 fig 8c accordingly ζ was calculated to be equal to 0 41 0 5 for the som confirming its cassie baxter state the calculated low wetting state factor for the som suggests a low liquid air sagging depth as illustrated in fig 8c according to equation 3 a lower ɵa for the scm would yield a higher sagging depth and accordingly moving closer to the transition state of wetting 3 4 dcmd fouling performance using high salinity and low surface tension oily wastewater in these experiments the membranes were tested with a saline oil in water emulsion composed of a 1 m nacl 0 05 mm sds aqueous feed spiked with different oil concentrations to represent challenging oily wastewaters where both surfactants and oils could be simultaneously present oil was dosed at the point of time zero which correspond to the time when initial steady state operating parameters were obtained this occurred 1 h after the start of the test during which the feed consisted of saline water containing 0 05 mm sds alone without any oil addition after that the 1 v v oil in water emulsion was added step wise to the feed every 2 h yielding oil concentrations in the feed of 50 100 200 and 400 ppm after the four consecutive oil additions the feed solution was continuously inspected and replenished when necessary to maintain constant salinity sds and oil concentration the normalized flux and salt rejection for the commercial scm and som membranes are shown in fig 9 the hydrophobic commercial membrane rapidly fouled upon the first oil addition i e at oil concentration of 50 ppm fig 9a the water flux gradually diminished and dropped to zero within 2 h of operation however the salt rejection was not affected suggesting that membrane fouling by oil not wetting was dominant after that the commercial experiment was allowed to continue for one more hour up to a total experiment time of 4 h during that time the flux remained zero and the sr remained constant the oil molecules being hydrophobic easily attached to and fouled the hydrophobic commercial membrane surface due to strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions in this case oil foulants did not only cover the membrane surface but also wicked into the pores blocking them and subsequently preventing vapor transfer and diminishing membrane flux this could be clearly seen from the post mortem membrane images where the membrane surface facing the feed was completely covered with oil stains figs 9b 2 while small areas on the bottom membrane surface i e facing the permeate were also fouled with what seemed to be oil which had wicked through the membrane pores figs 9b 3 both scm and som on the other hand demonstrated stable md operation during the first step of oil addition nevertheless when the oil concentration in the feed was increased to 100 ppm the scm experienced a small decrease in flux likely due to oil fouling within 2 h of operation at 100 ppm oil concertation the scm flux decreased by 25 of its initial value which was also accompanied by a slight reduction in its salt rejection sr fig 9a this decrease in sr is a sign of partial pore wetting which could be attributed to the absorbed surfactants on the oil surface suggesting that both fouling and partial wetting simultaneously occurred further addition of oil to a concentration of 200 ppm caused a significant deterioration in the scm s performance within 2 h the flux increased by approximately 3 folds of its initial value while the sr dropped to less than 40 suggesting wetting dominance rezaei et al 2018 mainly attributed fouling to membrane wetting in md while macro corrugations limited oil fouling in the case of scm to 25 flux decline as mentioned the scm could not resist the surfactant wetting induced by oil at high concentrations when both oil the foulant and sds surfactant the wetting agent are present in the feed wetting is expected to happen through two different mechanisms or the combination thereof huang et al 2016 the first mechanism is by bounding the oil soluble hydrophobic tails of the surfactants to the hydrophobic oil that is absorbed on the surface of the membrane pores the second mechanism is by bounding the hydrophobic tails of the surfactants to the membrane pores while its hydrophilic heads are in the water forming a bridge for the feed to permeate through the membrane wang and lin 2017 accordingly with such feeds as the one used in our experiment i e oil in water with surfactants the changes in flux and permeate quality could be used as indicators of which mechanism was dominant for pore wetting decreased permeate quality accompanied by flux decline is proof of both wetting and fouling which makes it more likely for the wetting to be induced because of the absorbed surfactants on the oil surface the first mechanism this was likely the case for the scm at 100 ppm oil concentration where both fouling and wetting were noticed with the former being more prevalent but still controlled thanks to the macro corrugations however a decreased salt rejection with flux increase or even with no change in flux would likely mean that wetting is mainly at play the second mechanism either by surfactants bounding to the membrane pores oil induced wetting bonding of the surfactant s hydrophobic tail to the hydrophobic oil that is absorbed on the surface of the membrane pores or the combination thereof this was likely the case for the scm at the 200 ppm oil concentration where the membrane experienced apparent and total membrane wetting nevertheless the exact mechanism or combination of mechanisms is difficult to determine and more experimentation would be required images of the scm after the test clearly show complete surface wetting with small areas being fouled by oil stains figs 9b 5 while feed penetration could also be spotted at the permeate side figs 9b 6 on the contrary the som maintained stable dcmd operation even at a high oil concentration of 400 ppm showing complete sr and enduring relatively stable water flux throughout the whole experiment time fig 9a moreover testing the som for an extended time period of 24 h with both feeds 1 m nacl with varying sds concentrations and 1 m nacl with 0 05 mm sds and varying oil concentrations still showed relatively stable dcmd performance confirming its robustness supplementary information fig s3 inspections of the som samples after the long term wetting and fouling md tests showed relatively clean membrane surfaces with minimal foulants deposition and the stability of sinps coating was confirmed by ca measurements of the used som supplementary information fig s3 the high cas measured after md testing of the som indicates its low adhesion to the used low surface tension feeds which was also confirmed by its very low sliding angle such robust operation for the som is a result of the developed hierarchical structure and stable sinps coating while the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between the membrane and oil might still exist for the som the propensity to wetting is highly minimized due to the effects of macro corrugations being more pronounced in this case instead of chemically breaking the hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction by developing a hydrophilic layer on the membrane surface as attempted by other researchers huang et al 2017 c li et al 2019 wang et al 2016b breaking this interaction physically through the development of surface corrugations was herein adopted the local turbulence and hydrodynamic shear force developed by surface macro corrugations can minimize oil adhesion on the surface and prevent its accumulation leading to relatively small chances for oil fouling moreover the superomniphobicity of the som ensures oil induced wetting by surfactants bonding to the oil prevention in contrast to the commercial and scm membranes where wetting could be induced by oil due to the lack of omniphobicity and thus surfactant penetration the after test images of the som revealed a relatively clean surface on the feed side with minimal oil stains figs 9b 8 and a clean surface on the permeate side suggesting no wetting or oil penetration fig 9b 9 the slippery theory defined earlier also showed a good correlation between fouling scaling and the wetting state of the membrane xiao et al 2020 the slippery surface of the som is attributed by a suspended wetting state wetting state factor ζ 0 5 as explained earlier resulting from its dual scale roughness and ultrahigh ca where the liquid droplet is suspended on the sinps figs 5d and 8c during md testing such a suspended wetting state and the associated slippery surface significantly lowered scaling and fouling by reducing the direct contact between foulants and the som surface 4 conclusions the full implementation of md for treatment of low surface tension industrial oily wastewaters is still hindered mainly due to major membrane issues such as wetting and fouling in this study we fabricated a superomniphobic membrane with a carefully designed hierarchical structure comprising macro micro and nano reentrant curvatures and investigated its performance against one commercial and one fabricated superhydrophobic corrugated membranes different low surface tension contaminants which are usually found in industrial wastewater streams were used in the tests we captured the first moment of interaction between a liquid droplet and the membrane surfaces to better understand their behavior when in contact with challenging feeds while the hydrophobic commercial membrane and our fabricated superhydrophobic corrugated membrane showed deteriorated performance due to the oil and surfactant in the water a mixture of both contaminants presented an even more complicated feed and changed how the same membranes performed suggesting performance deterioration could be attributed to different mechanisms when tested with saline solution contaminated with sds surfactant both the commercial and fabricated superhydrophobic membranes suffered from full wetting at different sds concentrations moreover testing with saline oil in water emulsion stabilized by sds showed severe fouling for the commercial hydrophobic membrane and partial fouling followed by wetting for the superhydrophobic membrane the combination of partial fouling and full wetting for the superhydrophobic membrane is due to the complicated sds attachment mechanism either to the hydrophobic oil the hydrophobic membrane surface or the combination of both the superomniphobic membrane on the other hand outperformed the other membranes as a result of its hierarchical design and the subsequent very high liquid air interface fraction resisting both wetting and fouling and showing stable md performance with complicated feeds at high concentrations of low surface tension surfactant and oil and for extended operation time oil and sds were both unable to wick through the membrane pores due to its omniphobic anti wetting nature similarly the hydrophobic oil present in the feed was unable to attach to the membrane surface declaration of
