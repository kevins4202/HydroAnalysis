1300,a field injection experiment was performed in an anoxic sandy aquifer over 6 days to assess sorption characteristics of 7 commonly applied pesticides in agriculture and 2 frequently detected metabolites pesticide use changed considerably in the last decades and there is insufficient knowledge of the fate of currently used pesticides in aquifers injected water arrival was monitored at 6 depth intervals of 1 m ranging from 11 4 to 32 2 m below surface level with varying organic carbon contents 0 057 0 91 d w to examine intra aquifer variations in sorption observed pesticide concentrations were fit using a non linear least squares routine to an advection dispersion equation from which retardation factors r were obtained pesticide degradation did not significantly influence the simulated r during the experiment we observed that bentazon and cycloxydim were most mobile with r 1 1 at all depths desphenyl chloridazon methyl desphenyl chloridazon and imidacloprid were on average less mobile with maximum r of 1 5 boscalid chloridazon fluopyram and flutolanil showed a larger range of r and r 2 0 were observed in the shallowest part of the aquifer largest r were observed at the top of the aquifer and decreased with depth koc values varied similarly which indicates that sorption is not only influenced by sedimentary organic matter som content but also by its sorption reactivity obtained sorption parameters were substantially lower than reported in a widely used pesticide sorption database which suggests that sorption parameters are influenced by methodological differences and variations in the sorption reactivity of som the large intra aquifer variations in pesticide sorption highlights that aquifer heterogeneity should be considered in

introduction pesticides and their metabolites are increasingly detected in groundwater systems over the last decades arias estevez et al 2008 burri et al 2019 heavy use of pesticides in agriculture adversely impacts groundwater resources understanding of pesticide transport processes is essential to assess the pesticide spreading risk through aquifers these insights are even more urgent as managed aquifer recharge mar technologies become more common sprenger et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 mar systems store freshwater in aquifers often for later re use dillon et al 2019 sprenger et al 2017 using available surface water or stormwater in mar can introduce pesticides directly into groundwater systems examples are i riverbank filtration where surface water infiltrates and flows towards groundwater abstraction wells hiscock and grischek 2002 ray 2008 and ii aquifer storage transfer and recovery as t r in which for example stormwater can be directly injected into an aquifer using wells page et al 2010 vanderzalm et al 2011 aquifer sorption parameters retardation factors partition coefficients kd and organic carbon water partition coefficients koc are commonly determined by batch experiments clausen et al 2004 de lipthay et al 2007 janniche et al 2011 kiecak et al 2019 madsen et al 2000 moreau and mouvet 1997 rae et al 1998 sediment water and pesticides are combined and mixed after which the pesticide decrease in the liquid phase is determined oecd 2000 limousin et al 2007 acknowledge the difficulty of translating batch experiment results to porous media as the solid solution ratio and the hydrodynamic conditions differ largely column experiments have the benefit that sorption during advective transport can be studied under controlled conditions although obtained results are mostly limited to the experiment scale and are not directly transferable to aquifers banzhaf and hebig 2016 in situ experiments in aquifer sediments hold substantial advantages over column experiments i experiments are done under field conditions and are therefore site specific ii often larger volumes of aquifer sediments are studied which make the results more representative and iii risks of disturbance or contamination of aquifer materials are smaller as no drilling and relocation of sediments is needed in situ pesticide sorption studies in aquifers are limited broholm et al 2001a broholm et al 2001b pang and close 2001 rügge et al 1999a rügge et al 1999b springer and bair 1998 widmer and spalding 1995 widmer et al 1995 živančev et al 2019 all these studies conducted a natural gradient experiment in which water which contained pesticides was injected into an aquifer after which the plume movement was monitored and analyzed aside of živančev et al 2019 the studies were all done more than 20 years ago and since then pesticide use changed greatly in europe this can be partly related to directive 2009 128 ec and ec 1107 2009 which both aim to achieve sustainable pesticide use of all pesticides examined in the previous in situ pesticides sorption studies only acetamiprid and bentazon are approved by the ec 1107 2009 regulation in our study we focus on the sorption of 6 commonly used present day approved agricultural pesticides bentazon boscalid chloridazon cycloxydim fluopyram flutolanil 2 regularly observed metabolites desphenyl chloridazon and methyl desphenyl chloridazon and the recently 2013 eu banned pesticide imidacloprid gross 2013 pesticide mobility is affected by aquifer heterogeneity during and after genesis intra aquifer variations are developed for example lithology mineral content and organic carbon content these variations result in fluctuations in pesticide sorption which can be crucial to assess potential groundwater contamination risks mar sites facilitate studying this heterogeneity during the injection of a new type of water into an aquifer to our knowledge only broholm et al 2001b studied in situ intra aquifer variations of 2 methyl 4 6 dinitrophenol dnoc sorption which was done in a low organic carbon aquifer during their field injection experiment they studied a relatively small layer of 1 m at 3 different depths furthermore they assessed a 3 5 m aquifer layer at 12 depths using batch experiments they observed spatially varying dnoc sorption related to variations in clay minerals and ph organic carbon content is often the most important factor related to pesticide sorption when available delle site 2001 fetter et al 1999 in the current research we examine an aquifer from 11 33 m below surface level with a wide range of organic carbon contents 0 057 0 91 d w at the 6 depth intervals studied this range is significantly larger than in the previous in situ pesticide sorption studies together broholm et al 2001a broholm et al 2001b pang and close 2001 rügge et al 1999a rügge et al 1999b springer and bair 1998 widmer and spalding 1995 widmer et al 1995 živančev et al 2019 where the aquifers examined had organic carbon contents ranging from 0 007 0 16 d w in the current study we assess pesticide sorption during the first operation of an astr system in which agricultural tile drainage water containing pesticides is injected in the aquifer for later re use as irrigation water we follow a similar set up as the previous mentioned in situ pesticide sorption studies with the key differences i tile drainage water tdw from an agricultural field was used as injection water ii intra aquifer variations were examined with monitoring wells at 6 different depths and iii an extensive sedimentological and geochemical characterization of the aquifer was performed the objectives of this study are to i determine sorption parameters of 7 commonly applied pesticides and 2 regularly detected metabolites injected during this in situ experiment at 6 different depths with a wide range of organic carbon content ii compare obtained sorption parameters to a widely used literature database and iii assess the effects and implications of intra aquifer variations with depth on sorption 2 material and methods 2 1 field site description the study site is located in an agricultural area in a polder in the north western part of the netherlands coordinates 52 8883 4 8221 here an aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr system stores water during wet periods in the underlying confined aquifer using wells and re uses this water in dry periods to irrigate flower bulbs for additional information about the field site see supplementary information 1 s1 tile drainage water tdw containing pesticides is collected from 10 ha of agricultural land and injected via a vertical well in a sandy anoxic aquifer 11 5 33 0 m below surface level b s l of late holocene and pleistocene origin below a confining holocene clay peat layer the aquifer studied consists of sediments from three different geological formations based on the dutch national database of subsurface information tno nitg 2021 the boxtel formation extends from approximately 8 19 m b s l and consists mostly of aeolian and fluvial sands deposited from early holocene untill middle pleistocene schokker et al 2005 the eem formation is situated below from about 20 28 m b s l and consists mostly of marine sands deposited during the early pleistocene bosch et al 2003 below the drenthe formation is situated from about 29 34 m b s l built up mostly from glacial sands in the middle pleistocene bakker et al 2003 a monitoring well screen is situated in the gravel pack of the injection well furthermore monitoring wells mw1 6 placed at 6 depths from 11 4 to 32 2 m b s l for specific depths see table 1 are distributed over 3 boreholes at 2 5 m distance from the injection well the three shallowest monitoring wells mw1 2 and 3 are situated in the boxtel formation mw4 and 5 in the eem formation and mw6 in the drenthe formation 2 2 description field injection experiment the field injection experiment took place from 1 to 6 november 2019 during which a total of about 440m3 tdw was injected during astr operation tdw contained pesticides originating from agriculture in environmental concentrations rather than elevated concentrations often used in laboratory experiments furthermore cl concentrations were notably lower in tdw in comparison to the native brackish groundwater injection occurred continuously during daytime water quality was monitored before during and after the arrival of the injected tdw at mw1 6 and at the injection well injected tdw was sampled with a peristaltic pump eijkelkamp the netherlands from the monitoring well in the gravel pack of this injection well every 30 min at the start of each day about 60 l was abstracted from this monitoring well to remove the standing volume of the well ca 11 l concurrently every 30 min a water sample was collected from a specific monitoring well such that each monitoring well was sampled every 3 h 6 monitoring wells x 30 min 3 h the standing volume of the wells max 17 l was removed before sampling by abstracting 30 l using a diaphragm pump liquiport nf1 100 knf verder the netherlands 2 3 estimation of longitudinal dispersivity longitudinal dispersivities were estimated independently for each well screen depth interval of mw1 6 we assumed that the major flow path between the injection well and the monitoring wells was radial 1 dimensional 1d as i the aquifer studied is anisotropic which means here that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity is significantly larger compared to the vertical and most importantly ii the model did simulate conservative transport remarkably well at all different depths as shown in fig 1 observed cl concentrations were fit to the approximate

injection d k n the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of layer n m d ε n the porosity of layer n and kd the transmissivity of the target aquifer m2 d k n ε n and kd are not exactly known but their combined value k n ε n kd was determined at the arrival of the spreading front breakthrough at this moment the r 50 and q are known and t can be estimated via eq 2 dispersivities were estimated separately for mw1 6 eq 1 was fit to observed chloride concentrations using a non linear least squares routine in python python v 3 6 4 furthermore the standard deviation of the dispersivity was calculated by taking the square root of the variance of the fit multiplied with 1 96 2 4 estimation of retardation factors a similar method was used to estimate retardation factors r of the pesticides assuming 1d transport and instantaneous equilibrium sorption periods without injection were disregarded as no additional sorption would occur eq 2 was adjusted to simulate retardation by dividing t time since start of injection by r r was estimated for the pesticides at the screen depths of mw1 6 the adjusted equation was fit to the observed pesticide concentrations to obtain r using a non linear least squares routine in python python v 3 6 4 2 5 determination of kd and koc r values obtained were converted to partition coefficients kd l kg and organic carbon water partition coefficients koc l kg with eq 3 appelo and postma 2004 fetter et al 1999 3 k d r 1 ε ρ b where k oc k d f oc where ρ b is the bulk density of the aquifer matrix kg l 1 calculated as 1 ε ρ s where ρ s is the density of mainly quartz solids in the aquifer matrix 2 65 kg l 1 and f oc is the fraction of organic carbon in the aquifer matrix at the well screen depths of mw1 6 the porosity ε is assumed to vary between 0 2 and 0 35 based on table 3 1 from appelo and postma 2004 a minimum and maximum kd and koc was calculated using ε 0 2 and 0 35 2 6 comparison obtained sorption parameters to literature data kd and koc values obtained in the current study were compared to values from the pesticides properties database ppdb this database is evidence based and contains data of for example the chemical identity physical chemistry human health and ecotoxicology of pesticides from regulatory dossiers peer reviewed publications and manufacturer datasheets therefore it provides an extensive dataset which can be used for pesticide risk assessments lewis et al 2016 the ppdb database contains information on linear sorption isotherms but most of the sorption parameters describes freundlich sorption isotherms the equation below shows the linear sorption isotherm 4 s k d c k d s c where s is the mass of solute sorbed per dry unit weight of solid mg mg and c is the pesticide concentration in solution mg m3 the equation below presents the freundlich sorption isotherm 5 s k f c n where kf is the freundlich constant and n a constant which describes the nonlinearity of the freundlich isotherm the kd value valid at a specific concentration can be derived from the freundlich parameters by combining eqs 4 and 5 k d k f c n c log k d log k f n log c log c 6 log k d log k f n 1 log c we calculated ranges of kd values for the concentration range in this study from kf and n values using eq 6 in order to compare the kd values obtained at our field site with the sorption data in the ppdb database the kd range was calculated for the pesticide concentration in tdw which represented the pesticide concentration after the full arrival of the injected tdw and the minimum kd to pesticide concentration is 0 005 μg l which represented the lowest pesticide detection limit and the maximum kd 2 7 hydrochemical analysis water quality was monitored in the field using a flow cell for ec c4e

drill aqualock system using a core catcher from 2 m to 36 m b s l at the location of mw4 and 6 s1 oele et al 1983 sediment was stored in pvc liners of 1 m length and 103 mm inner diameter slight variations in diameter of the thin wall tubes 103 mm internal diameter id and the sonic drill aqualock system 97 mm id resulted in compaction of the sediment a correction was applied to the core lengths and depths for this variation the top and bottom 20 cm of sediments were discarded due to possible contamination subsamples were taken of every 10 cm of each core from which a mixed sample was made representing depth intervals of about 1 0 m the representative contents of geochemical parameters at well screen depth screen length 100 cm were determined by multiplying the fraction of the well screen that overlapped the depth interval of a specific mixed sample with the geochemical content of that mixed sample the contributions of the two neighboring mixed samples were added together afterwards variations in the contents of reactive constituents are assumed to be small in lateral directions as the aquifer sediments are all deposited horizontally and the lateral scale of the

measurements 59 were below the limit of quantification loq in ambient groundwater before infiltration table 1 some pesticides were already observed in groundwater max 0 076 μg l resulting from previous push pull tests these traces do not result from agricultural practice at ground level because infiltration of water is negligible at the land surface as shown by the i groundwater seepage flux of about 4 7 mm year in the polder boekel et al 2014 and ii the negative base exchange index bex of the ambient groundwater which indicates that salinization is occurring by inflow of groundwater from larger depths stuyfzand 1993 groundwater was relatively fresh at the well screen depths of mw1 2 and 3 ec between 1850 and 2000 μs cm but got more saline deeper in the aquifer at mw4 5 and 6 ec 3280 5090 8930 μs cm respectively the redox state is anoxic with mostly mn iv and fe iii reducing conditions tile drainage water tdw contained 9 pesticides above loq of the 20 pesticides in our measurement method table 1 bentazon boscalid chloridazon desphenyl chloridazon d chloridazon methyl desphenyl chloridazon md chloridazon cycloxydim fluopyram flutolanil and imidacloprid boscalid chloridazon cycloxydim and fluopyram were applied in 2018 and or 2019 by the flower bulb grower observed concentrations were relatively low mostly in between 0 01 and 0 15 μg l exceptions were observed for fluopyram flutolanil and the metabolites d chloridazon and md chloridazon with concentrations between 0 15 and 12 μg l d chloridazon and md chloridazon concentrations were about 100 times larger than their parent compound chloridazon most pesticide concentrations were relatively stable over time in the injected tdw the 10 and 90 percentiles of the temporal pesticide concentrations in tdw did not deviate more than 25 from the mean concentrations except for boscalid and flutolanil boscalid showed a decreasing concentration during the first day of injection from about 0 15 to 0 05 μg l after which concentrations remained relatively stable in the following 4 days observed flutolanil concentrations were more scattered the 10 and 90 quantile deviated about 55 from the mean concentration tdw was relatively fresh average ec is 1440 μs cm oxic and had relatively high doc concentrations on average 26 3 mg l the contents of reactive constituents were relatively high in sediment samples of mw 1 and 3 table 1 mw 1 had the highest soc 0 91 d w and clay contents 5 5 d w and mw 3 the highest carbonate 11 0 d w and al fe contents 4 5 d w reactive constituents were relatively low in mw 2 e g soc 0 14 d w clay 1 1 d w and even lower in mw4 5 and 6 e g soc 0 057 0 066 d w clay 0 49 1 1 d w 3 2 simulation of conservative transport tdw had significantly lower cl concentrations compared to ambient groundwater from all monitoring wells at 2 5 m distance from the injection well table 1 which made cl an ideal conservative tracer for the dispersivity estimations the tracer curves showed that at least one pore volume had been injected at the well screen depths of mw1 6 fig 1 the earliest arrival occurred in mw 4 after about 110 m3 injection and the latest in mw 6 after 420 m3 injection longitudinal dispersivities αl were estimated at all well screen depths table 1 dispersivities fit well to the observed cl concentrations for the different monitoring wells fig 1 minimum r2 0 945 the αl values are all within 1 order of magnitude mw 2 and 4 excluded mw 4 shows the lowest αl 2 52 cm mw 2 the highest 31 1 cm 3 3 obtained retardation factors retardation factors were obtained by fitting the analytical equation to the observed pesticide concentrations generally good fits were obtained with 60 of the fits showing r2 0 7 and 40 of the fits r2 0 9 fits with r2 0 7 were discarded from further interpretation the experimental duration was too short to observe the arrival of all pesticides the delayed arrival of these pesticides is expected to be caused by sorption for these cases the minimum r was obtained for example see fig 2 subplot mw 1 in total 37 r values were obtained for further analysis with more than 80 below 2 0 pesticide degradation can influence pesticide arrival and consequently also the deduced r potential occurrence of degradation can most easily be determined in mw 3 4 and 5 where mostly complete break through curves were observed s3 note that sorption is not influencing observed concentrations after arrival and degradation is reflected by concentrations consistently lower than injected concentration levels degradation was only observed for chloridazon in mw 4 and probably also in mw 5 chloridazon concentrations decreased during aquifer transport to about the 10 percentile of the injection water concentrations the obtained r value was not significantly affected by degradation during the experiment as the fit to the observed concentrations during arrival was good fig 2 shows the observed concentrations the associated model fits and the obtained r for fluopyram at the different depths in the aquifer we show here only the results of fluopyram as example as it shows an interesting variation of r within the aquifer figures for the other pesticides can be observed in the supporting information s3 observed concentrations gradually increase in all monitoring wells during the experiment except for mw 1 the determined r values decrease with depth relatively high r values were observed at mw 1 2 and 3 2 0 1 64 and 1 52 respectively and low values at mw 4 r 1 09 and at mw 5 and mw 6 both close to 1 the deduced r values are not influenced by non equilibrium sorption as the center of mass of a breakthrough curve is independent of kinetic constraints brusseau 1994 brusseau et al 1989 whereas non equilibrium sorption results in fronting and tailing during arrival of tdw bouchard et al 1988 burke et al 2013 for fluopyram in fig 2 observed pesticide concentrations show no distinct tailing and fronting this suggests that retardation is resulting from equilibrium sorption a similar trend is observed for most other pesticides s3 exceptions hold for chloridazon in mw 3 and imidacloprid in mw 3 and 4 however prior investigations did not detect non equilibrium sorption of chloridazon sánchez martín and sánchez camazano 1991 and imidacloprid cox et al 1998a cox et al 1997 and could simulate their sorption with equilibrium sorption isotherms fig 3 shows the r values for all pesticides at all well screen depths large variations in r are observed between the different depths for most pesticides with r generally being largest in mw 1 and 2 and lowest in mw 4 5 and 6 bentazon and cycloxydim were the most mobile pesticides with r 1 2 at all depths d chloridazon md chloridazon and imidacloprid were slightly less mobile with r ranging between 0 8 and 1 5 boscalid chloridazon fluopyram and flutolanil show a larger range of r with maximum r 2 0 in mw 1 the largest r value was determined for boscalid in mw 2 r 3 5 r of all pesticides never exceeded r 1 2 in mw 4 5 and 6 except for imidacloprid in mw 5 3 4 retardation versus intra aquifer variations in geochemical properties pesticides observed during the experiment can be divided in 3 groups based on pka and isoelectric point calculations s2 i anionic pesticides which consists of bentazon and cycloxydim ii non ionic hydrophilic pesticides log dow 2 which consist of chloridazon plus its metabolites and imidacloprid and iii non ionic hydrophobic pesticides log dow between 2 and 4 5 which consist of boscalid fluopyram and flutolanil as bentazon and cycloxydim retardation was not significant al3 and fe3 hydroxide borggaard and gimsing 2008 or organic matter kah and brown 2006 tülp et al 2009 sorption of anionic pesticides appear subordinate mechanisms in the current study several prior researches studied sorption of polar pesticides to different soil sorbents sánchez martín and sánchez camazano 1991 studied chloridazon adsorption in 18 different natural soils soc content ranging from 0 05 to 7 70 d w calculated from sedimentary organic matter som content with a conversion factor of 2 0 pribyl 2010 they observed that organic matter content accounted for 72 of the variance in adsorption effects of clay content on extent of adsorption were relatively small cox et al 1997 studied imidacloprid sorption in soils they discovered a strong correlation between kf freundlich partition coefficient and soc content r2 0 995 3 soils soc content ranged from 1 4 4 1 d w cox et al 1998b observed a similar correlation between kf and soc content r2 0 94 for 7 natural soils soc content ranged from 0 29 3 95 d w these findings correspond with the higher r observed for chloridazon and imidacloprid in the current project at the depths with higher soc contents therefore we can assume that soc is the major sorbent for the hydrophilic pesticide group to our knowledge no relevant sorption studies were performed on the sorption of the specific compounds in the hydrophobic pesticide group soc is generally the main sorbent for hydrophobic pesticides fetter et al 1999 wauchope et al 2002 this corresponds with the observed r in this study which mostly increase when soc content increases in the current research pesticide r at the different depths showed the strongest correlations with soc contents compared to the other geochemical parameters table 2 nonetheless all observed geochemical parameters are positively correlated with pesticide r and are also positively correlated with each other we can safely assume that soc is the major sorbent for most pesticides studied as this corresponds with this and prior studies therefore we converted r to organic carbon water partition coefficients koc which are presented in fig 3 at shallow depths mw 1 2 and 3 koc values are remarkably higher than at the depths of mw 4 5 and 6 while koc would be expected in the same range because soc is the main soil sorption parameter therefore we can conclude that the content of soc is not the only factor controlling pesticide sorption the sorption reactivity of soc probably plays a role as well 3 5 in situ field sorption parameters versus literature parameters literature sorption parameters were not available from aquifer studies column or field studies for the pesticides examined except for bentazon e g tuxen et al 2000 r 1 00 madsen et al 2000 r 1 00 1 25 broholm et al 2001a r 1 1 instead obtained r values were compared to sorption parameters retrieved from the ppdb database lewis et al 2016 which is often used in pesticide transport studies e g lefrancq et al 2017 rouzies et al 2019 freundlich sorption parameters were converted to linear kd values applicable for a defined concentration range lowest detection limit 0 005 μg l to maximum concentration in tdw based on eq 6 these freundlich sorption parameters have mostly been obtained from batch experiments with topsoils performed for regulatory purposes kd and koc obtained in this study are both considerably lower for all pesticides than the range retrieved from the ppdb database fig 3 3 6 explanations for low kd and koc and intra aquifer variations temperature aquifer heterogeneity and doc associated transport seem not the cause of the relatively low kd and koc observed as argued in the following sorption generally decreases with increasing temperature delle site 2001 while aquifer temperatures 10 12 c were lower than applicable for standard batch experiments room temperature 20 c aquifer heterogeneity can cause lower sorption than expected clay and soc contents are significantly correlated in this study table 2 which reflects that less permeable and more clayey aquifer section contain the most soc the soc content in the more permeable parts of the aquifer is therefore probably lower than the average soc content determined for these aquifer layers consequently less sorption may be observed than expected based on the soc content of the entire layer we deem in unlikely that the lower sorption is caused by aquifer heterogeneity as small clay layers were only observed at the well screen depth of mw 2 and mw 3 for more information see s4 and relatively low koc were observed at all depths doc associated transport is an additional and often rapid transport pathway for pesticides which can result in an increased mobility fetter et al 1999 it can be indicated by larger velocities of the pesticides than the average groundwater which can result in r 1 0 enfield et al 1989 fetter et al 1999 the larger velocities are resulting from size exclusion effects which are observed as molecules or ions are restricted to travel through larger pores due to their size where groundwater velocities are greater than average fetter et al 1999 this is observed for bentazon d chloridazon md chloridazon and cycloxydim at mw 5 6 and for cycloxydim at mw 3 which could suggest the occurrence of doc associated transport however we deem it unlikely that doc associated transport has more than a minor control at this site as first doc itself does not show r 1 0 while pesticides sorbed to the doc travel with the same speed fig 4 during the field injection experiment sorption and or degradation of doc is suggested by the lower concentrations compared to the conservative concentrations during and after the breakthrough at all depths two analytical solutions were fitted to the observed doc concentrations one simulating only retardation and the other only degradation a clearly better fit was observed for the solution simulating degradation only which suggests that retardation of doc is limited but not 1 0 in this aquifer for more information see s5 second doc associated transport is only likely when a substantial fraction of the pesticide is bound to doc which is unlikely as the pesticides with r 1 0 are the most hydrophilic of those pesticides studied s2 it is therefore unclear which mechanism caused the observed r 1 0 methodological differences and a low sedimentary organic matter som sorption reactivity probably caused the lower sorption observed in this study compared to the ppdb database batch experiments can result in outcomes unrealistic for aquifers as they are often performed with different solid solution ratios and or dissimilar hydrodynamic conditions banzhaf and hebig 2016 limousin et al 2007 a low som sorption reactivity can also result in less sorption and can have different causes such as the oxygen exposure extent of som during and after deposition grathwohl 1990 hartog et al 2004 som chemical composition ahmad et al 2001 karapanagioti et al 2000 coating and masking of som el arfaoui et al 2012 and som aging weber and huang 1996 it is therefore possible that the som sorption reactivity of the aquifer sediments is generally lower than from the experiments performed for the sorption parameters in the ppdb database furthermore we observed remarkably lower koc values at shallow depths mw 4 5 and 6 compared to mw 1 2 and 3 the higher koc at shallower depths correspond to the aeolian and fluvial aquifer sediments of the boxtel formation we assume that the higher koc at the shallow depths are mainly caused by a higher som sorption reactivity in these aquifer sediments compared to the marine and glacial sediments from the other formations eems and drenthe composing the aquifer 3 7 insights on mar operation and groundwater risk management obtaining in situ r is only possible while performing a field injection experiment if there is a distinct difference in pesticide concentration between the infiltrated water and ambient groundwater and if degradation can be ruled out the easiest and often only possibility to perform this experiment is at the start of mar operation although r does not necessarily stay constant afterwards pesticides were more mobile in this aquifer than expected based on literature sorption parameters from the ppdb database this shows the large uncertainty which is involved by using literature sorption parameters to assess pesticide transport in aquifers the relatively low r observed in this study can both be a positive and negative outcome for as t r operation at this location low r simplifies restoration of the aquifer to native conditions after as t r operation is stopped as it is easier to reclaim the injected pesticides contrarily injected pesticides travel further within the aquifer which increases the risk of groundwater contamination in the current study the pesticides examined were originating from agricultural use pesticide legislation changed considerably in the last decades which resulted in a large group of new pesticides applied there is insufficient knowledge of the fate of currently used pesticides in aquifers more field pesticide sorption studies are needed to better understand transport of these present day approved pesticides in aquifers we show the large impacts of aquifer heterogeneity on pesticide mobility in the current study intra aquifer variations in hydraulic conductivity resulted in large variations in pesticide mobility for example in mw 6 almost 4 the water volume was injected before arrival occurred compared to mw 4 these variations in mobility were strengthened by pesticide sorption a low permeability is related to a higher clay content and clay content is here significantly positively correlated with soc therefore aquifer parts with high permeability show often less pesticide sorption than low permeability parts taking aquifer heterogeneity in account is essential for an appropriate groundwater risk assessment as pesticide mobility can vary substantially within an aquifer 4 conclusion in this study we determined sorption parameters of 7 commonly applied pesticides and 2 regularly detected metabolites during a field injection experiment in an aquifer with a wide range of sedimentary organic carbon contents this experiment was performed at 6 depths which enabled us to assess the effects and implications of variations in sorption lastly we compared the obtained sorption parameters to a widely used literature database retardation factors r were obtained by fitting observed pesticide concentrations to an advection dispersion equation using a non linear least squares routine at each depth the results were not influenced by pesticide degradation during the experiment the most mobile pesticides were bentazon and cycloxydim with r 1 1 at all depths the pesticides desphenyl chloridazon methyl desphenyl chloridazon and imidacloprid were generally less mobile with a maximum r observed of 1 5 least mobile were the pesticides boscalid chloridazon fluopyram and flutolanil which showed a larger range of r with a maximum of r 2 0 pesticide retardation was largest in the shallow aquifer and decreased in the deeper aquifer the comparison of the pesticide sorption parameters with the literature database showed that sorption in the currently researched aquifer was remarkably lower than expected based on the sorption parameters obtained mostly from batch experiments in the pesticide sorption database the lower sorption observed in this research was most likely resulting from a lower sorption reactivity of sedimentary organic matter in the studied aquifer and or a dissimilar solid solution ratio and hydrodynamic conditions during the batch experiments compared to the aquifer studied the relatively low r observed can be positive for aquifer storage transfer and recovery as it is easier to reclaim all injected pesticides after operation on the other hand pesticides advance further into the aquifer which increases the risk of groundwater contamination besides the decreasing r with depth we also observed a decrease of koc with depth we think it is likely that the variation in koc results from variations in sorption reactivity of the sedimentary organic matter this study shows large intra aquifer variations in pesticide sorption which demonstrates the importance of taking aquifer heterogeneity in account for appropriate groundwater risk assessments credit authorship

1300,a field injection experiment was performed in an anoxic sandy aquifer over 6 days to assess sorption characteristics of 7 commonly applied pesticides in agriculture and 2 frequently detected metabolites pesticide use changed considerably in the last decades and there is insufficient knowledge of the fate of currently used pesticides in aquifers injected water arrival was monitored at 6 depth intervals of 1 m ranging from 11 4 to 32 2 m below surface level with varying organic carbon contents 0 057 0 91 d w to examine intra aquifer variations in sorption observed pesticide concentrations were fit using a non linear least squares routine to an advection dispersion equation from which retardation factors r were obtained pesticide degradation did not significantly influence the simulated r during the experiment we observed that bentazon and cycloxydim were most mobile with r 1 1 at all depths desphenyl chloridazon methyl desphenyl chloridazon and imidacloprid were on average less mobile with maximum r of 1 5 boscalid chloridazon fluopyram and flutolanil showed a larger range of r and r 2 0 were observed in the shallowest part of the aquifer largest r were observed at the top of the aquifer and decreased with depth koc values varied similarly which indicates that sorption is not only influenced by sedimentary organic matter som content but also by its sorption reactivity obtained sorption parameters were substantially lower than reported in a widely used pesticide sorption database which suggests that sorption parameters are influenced by methodological differences and variations in the sorption reactivity of som the large intra aquifer variations in pesticide sorption highlights that aquifer heterogeneity should be considered in

introduction pesticides and their metabolites are increasingly detected in groundwater systems over the last decades arias estevez et al 2008 burri et al 2019 heavy use of pesticides in agriculture

mixed after which the pesticide decrease in the liquid phase is determined oecd 2000 limousin et al 2007 acknowledge the difficulty of translating batch experiment results to porous media as the solid solution ratio and the hydrodynamic conditions differ largely column experiments have the benefit that sorption during advective transport can be studied under controlled conditions although obtained results are mostly limited to the experiment scale and are not directly transferable to aquifers banzhaf and hebig 2016 in situ experiments in aquifer sediments hold substantial advantages over column experiments i experiments are done under field conditions and are therefore site specific ii often larger volumes of aquifer sediments are studied which make the results more representative and iii risks of disturbance or contamination of aquifer materials are smaller as no drilling and relocation of sediments is needed in situ pesticide sorption studies in aquifers are limited broholm et al

natural gradient experiment in which water which contained pesticides was injected into an aquifer after which the plume movement was monitored and analyzed aside of živančev et al 2019 the studies were all done more than 20 years ago and since then pesticide use changed greatly in europe this can be partly related to directive 2009 128 ec and ec 1107 2009 which both aim to achieve sustainable pesticide use of all pesticides examined in the previous in situ pesticides sorption studies only acetamiprid and bentazon are approved by the ec 1107 2009 regulation in our study we focus on the sorption of 6 commonly used present day approved agricultural pesticides bentazon boscalid chloridazon cycloxydim fluopyram flutolanil 2 regularly observed metabolites desphenyl chloridazon and methyl desphenyl chloridazon and the recently 2013 eu banned pesticide imidacloprid gross 2013 pesticide mobility is affected by aquifer heterogeneity during and after genesis intra aquifer variations are developed for example lithology mineral content and organic carbon content these variations result in fluctuations in pesticide sorption which can be crucial to assess potential groundwater contamination risks mar sites facilitate studying this heterogeneity during the injection of a new type of water into an aquifer to our knowledge only broholm et al 2001b studied in situ intra aquifer variations of 2 methyl 4 6 dinitrophenol dnoc sorption which was done in a low organic carbon aquifer during their field injection experiment they studied a relatively small layer of 1 m at 3 different depths furthermore they assessed a 3 5 m aquifer layer at 12 depths using batch experiments they observed spatially varying dnoc sorption related to variations in clay minerals and ph organic carbon content is often the most important factor related to pesticide sorption when available delle site 2001 fetter et al 1999 in the current research we examine an aquifer from 11 33 m

where the aquifers examined had organic carbon contents ranging from 0 007 0 16 d w in the current study we assess pesticide sorption during the first operation of an astr system in which agricultural tile drainage water containing pesticides is injected in the aquifer for later re use as irrigation water we follow a similar set up as the previous mentioned in situ pesticide sorption studies with the key differences i tile drainage water tdw from an agricultural field was used as injection water ii intra aquifer variations were examined with monitoring wells at 6 different depths and iii an extensive sedimentological and geochemical characterization of the aquifer was performed the objectives of this study are to i determine sorption parameters of 7 commonly applied pesticides and 2 regularly detected metabolites injected during this in situ experiment at 6 different depths with a wide range of organic carbon content ii compare obtained sorption parameters to a widely used literature database and iii assess the effects and implications of intra aquifer variations with depth on sorption 2 material and methods 2 1 field site description the study site is located in an agricultural area in a polder in the north western part of the netherlands coordinates 52 8883 4 8221 here an aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr system stores water during wet periods in the underlying confined aquifer using wells and re uses this water in dry periods to irrigate flower bulbs for additional information about the field site see supplementary information 1 s1 tile drainage water tdw containing pesticides is collected from 10 ha of agricultural land and injected via a vertical well in a sandy anoxic aquifer 11 5 33 0 m below surface level b s l of late holocene and pleistocene origin below a confining holocene clay peat layer the aquifer studied consists of sediments from three different geological formations based on the dutch national database of subsurface information tno nitg 2021 the boxtel formation extends from approximately 8 19 m b s l and consists mostly of aeolian and fluvial sands deposited from early holocene untill middle pleistocene schokker et al 2005 the eem formation is situated below from about 20 28 m b s l and consists mostly of marine sands deposited during the early pleistocene bosch et al 2003 below the drenthe formation is situated from about 29 34 m b s l built up mostly from glacial sands in the middle pleistocene bakker et al 2003 a monitoring well screen is situated in the gravel pack of the injection well furthermore monitoring wells mw1 6 placed at 6 depths from 11 4 to 32 2 m b s l for specific depths see table 1 are distributed over 3 boreholes at 2 5 m distance from the injection well the three shallowest monitoring wells mw1 2 and 3 are situated in the boxtel formation mw4 and 5 in the eem formation and mw6 in the drenthe formation 2 2 description field injection experiment the field injection experiment took place from 1 to 6 november 2019 during which a total of about 440m3 tdw was injected during astr operation tdw contained pesticides originating from agriculture in environmental concentrations rather than elevated concentrations often used in laboratory experiments furthermore cl concentrations were notably lower in tdw in comparison to the native brackish groundwater injection occurred continuously during daytime water quality was monitored before during and after the arrival of the injected tdw at mw1 6 and at the injection well injected tdw was sampled with a peristaltic pump eijkelkamp the netherlands from the monitoring well in the gravel pack of this injection well every 30 min at the start of each day about 60 l was abstracted from this monitoring well to remove the standing volume of the well ca 11 l concurrently every 30 min a water sample was collected from a specific monitoring well such that each monitoring well was sampled every 3 h 6 monitoring wells x 30 min 3 h the standing volume of the wells max 17 l was removed before sampling by abstracting 30 l using a diaphragm pump liquiport nf1 100 knf verder the netherlands 2 3 estimation of longitudinal dispersivity longitudinal dispersivities were estimated independently for each well screen depth interval of mw1 6 we assumed that the major flow path between the injection well and the monitoring wells was radial 1 dimensional 1d as i the aquifer studied is anisotropic which means here that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity is significantly larger compared to the vertical and most importantly ii the model did simulate conservative transport remarkably well at all different depths as shown in fig 1 observed cl concentrations were fit to the approximate

combined value k n ε n kd was determined at the arrival of the spreading front breakthrough at this moment the r 50 and q are known and t can be estimated via eq 2 dispersivities were estimated separately for mw1 6 eq 1 was fit to observed chloride concentrations using a non linear least squares routine in python python v 3 6 4 furthermore the standard deviation of the dispersivity was calculated by taking the square root of the variance of the fit multiplied with 1 96 2 4 estimation of retardation factors a similar method was used to estimate retardation factors r of the pesticides assuming 1d transport and instantaneous equilibrium sorption periods without injection were disregarded as no additional sorption would occur eq 2 was adjusted to simulate retardation by dividing t time since start of injection by r r was estimated for the pesticides at the screen depths of mw1 6 the adjusted equation was fit to the observed pesticide concentrations to obtain r using a non linear least squares routine in python python v 3 6 4 2 5 determination of kd and koc r values obtained were converted to partition coefficients kd l kg and organic carbon water partition coefficients

density of mainly quartz solids in the aquifer matrix 2 65 kg l 1 and f oc is the fraction of organic carbon in the aquifer matrix at the well screen depths of mw1 6 the porosity ε is assumed to vary between 0 2 and 0 35 based on table 3 1 from appelo and postma 2004 a minimum and maximum kd and koc was calculated using ε 0 2 and 0 35 2 6 comparison obtained sorption parameters to literature data kd and koc values obtained in the current study were compared to values from the pesticides properties database ppdb this database is evidence based and contains data of for example the chemical identity physical chemistry human health and ecotoxicology of pesticides from regulatory dossiers peer reviewed publications and manufacturer datasheets therefore it provides an extensive dataset which can be used for pesticide risk assessments lewis et al 2016 the ppdb database contains information on linear sorption isotherms but most of the sorption parameters describes freundlich sorption isotherms the equation below shows the linear sorption isotherm 4 s k d c k d s c where s is the mass of solute sorbed per dry unit weight of solid mg mg and c is the pesticide concentration in solution mg m3 the equation below presents the freundlich sorption isotherm 5 s k f c n where kf is the freundlich constant and n a constant which describes the nonlinearity of the freundlich isotherm the kd value valid at a specific concentration can be derived from the freundlich parameters by combining eqs 4 and 5 k d k f c n c log k d log k f n log c log c 6 log k d log k f n 1 log c we calculated ranges of kd values for the concentration range in this study from kf and n values using eq 6 in order to compare the kd values obtained at our field site with the sorption data in the ppdb database the kd range was calculated for the pesticide concentration in tdw which represented the pesticide concentration after the full arrival of the injected tdw and the minimum kd to pesticide concentration is 0 005 μg l which represented the lowest pesticide detection limit and the maximum kd 2 7 hydrochemical analysis water quality was monitored in the field using a flow cell for ec c4e

drill aqualock system using a core catcher from 2 m to 36 m b s l at the location of mw4 and 6 s1 oele et al 1983 sediment was stored in pvc liners of 1 m length and 103 mm inner diameter slight variations in diameter of the thin wall tubes 103 mm internal diameter id and the sonic drill aqualock system 97 mm id resulted in compaction of the sediment a correction was applied to the core lengths and depths for this variation the top and bottom 20 cm of sediments were discarded due to possible contamination subsamples were taken of every 10 cm of each core from which a mixed sample was made representing depth intervals of about 1 0 m the representative contents of geochemical parameters at well screen depth screen length 100 cm were determined by multiplying the fraction of the well screen that overlapped the depth interval of a specific mixed sample with the geochemical content of that mixed sample the contributions of the two neighboring mixed samples were added together

measurements 59 were below the limit of quantification loq in ambient groundwater before infiltration table 1 some pesticides were already observed in groundwater max 0 076 μg l resulting from previous push pull tests these traces do not result from agricultural practice at ground level because infiltration of water is negligible at the land surface as shown by the i groundwater seepage flux of about 4 7 mm year in the polder boekel et al 2014 and ii the negative base exchange index bex of the ambient groundwater which indicates that salinization is occurring by inflow of groundwater from larger depths stuyfzand 1993 groundwater was relatively fresh at the well screen depths of mw1 2 and 3 ec between 1850 and 2000 μs cm but got more saline deeper in the aquifer at mw4 5 and 6 ec

measurement method table 1 bentazon boscalid chloridazon desphenyl chloridazon d chloridazon methyl desphenyl chloridazon md chloridazon cycloxydim fluopyram flutolanil and imidacloprid boscalid chloridazon cycloxydim and fluopyram were applied in 2018 and or 2019 by the flower bulb grower observed concentrations were relatively low mostly in between 0 01 and 0 15 μg l exceptions were observed for fluopyram flutolanil and the metabolites d chloridazon and md chloridazon with concentrations between 0 15 and 12 μg l d chloridazon and md chloridazon concentrations were about 100 times larger than their parent compound chloridazon most pesticide concentrations were relatively stable over time in the injected tdw the 10 and 90 percentiles of the temporal pesticide concentrations in tdw did not deviate more than 25 from the mean concentrations except for boscalid and flutolanil boscalid showed a decreasing concentration during the first day of injection from about 0 15 to 0 05 μg l after which concentrations remained relatively stable in the following 4 days observed flutolanil concentrations were more scattered the 10 and 90 quantile deviated about 55 from the mean concentration tdw was relatively fresh average ec is 1440 μs cm oxic and had relatively high doc concentrations on average 26 3 mg l the contents of reactive constituents were relatively high in sediment samples of mw 1 and 3 table 1 mw 1 had the highest soc 0 91 d w and clay contents 5 5 d w and mw 3 the highest carbonate 11 0 d w and al fe contents 4 5 d w reactive constituents were

concentrations compared to ambient groundwater from all monitoring wells at 2 5 m distance from the injection well table 1 which made cl an ideal conservative tracer for the dispersivity estimations the tracer curves showed that at least one pore volume had been injected at the well screen depths of mw1 6 fig 1 the earliest arrival occurred in mw 4 after about 110 m3 injection and the latest in mw 6 after 420 m3 injection longitudinal dispersivities αl were estimated at all well screen depths table 1 dispersivities fit well to the observed cl concentrations for the different monitoring wells fig 1 minimum r2 0 945 the αl values are all within 1 order of magnitude mw 2 and 4 excluded mw 4 shows the lowest αl 2 52 cm mw 2 the highest 31 1 cm 3 3 obtained retardation factors retardation factors were obtained by fitting the analytical equation to the observed pesticide concentrations generally good fits were obtained with 60 of the fits showing r2 0 7 and 40 of the fits r2 0 9 fits with r2 0 7 were discarded from further interpretation the experimental duration was too short to observe the arrival of all pesticides the delayed arrival of these pesticides is expected to be caused by sorption for these cases the minimum r was obtained for example see fig 2 subplot mw 1 in total 37 r values were obtained for further analysis with more than 80 below 2 0 pesticide degradation can influence pesticide arrival and consequently also the deduced r potential occurrence of degradation can most easily be determined in mw 3 4 and 5 where mostly complete break through curves were observed s3 note that sorption is not influencing observed concentrations after arrival and degradation is reflected by concentrations consistently lower than injected concentration levels degradation was only observed for chloridazon in mw 4 and probably also in mw 5 chloridazon concentrations decreased during aquifer transport to about the 10 percentile of the injection water concentrations the obtained r value was not significantly affected by degradation during the experiment as the fit to the observed concentrations during arrival was good fig 2 shows the observed concentrations the associated model fits and the obtained r for fluopyram at the different depths in the aquifer we show here only the results of fluopyram as example as it shows an interesting variation of r within the aquifer figures for the other pesticides can be observed in the supporting information s3 observed concentrations gradually increase in all monitoring wells during the experiment except for mw 1 the determined r values decrease with depth relatively high r values were observed at mw 1 2 and 3 2 0 1 64 and 1 52 respectively and low values at mw 4 r 1 09 and at mw 5 and mw 6 both close to 1 the deduced r values are not influenced by non equilibrium sorption as the center of mass of a breakthrough curve is independent of kinetic constraints brusseau 1994 brusseau et al 1989 whereas non equilibrium sorption results in fronting and tailing during arrival of tdw bouchard et al 1988 burke et al 2013 for fluopyram in fig 2 observed pesticide concentrations show no distinct tailing and fronting this suggests that retardation is resulting from equilibrium sorption a similar trend is observed for most other pesticides s3 exceptions hold for chloridazon in mw 3 and imidacloprid in mw 3 and 4 however prior investigations did not detect non equilibrium sorption of chloridazon sánchez martín and sánchez camazano 1991 and imidacloprid cox et al 1998a cox et al 1997 and could simulate their sorption with equilibrium sorption isotherms fig 3 shows the r values for all pesticides at all well screen depths large variations in r are observed between the different depths for most pesticides with r generally being largest in mw 1 and 2 and lowest in mw 4 5 and 6 bentazon and cycloxydim were the most mobile pesticides with r 1 2 at all depths d chloridazon md chloridazon and imidacloprid were slightly less mobile with r ranging between 0 8 and 1 5 boscalid chloridazon fluopyram and flutolanil show a larger range of r with maximum r 2 0 in mw 1 the largest r value was determined for boscalid in mw 2 r 3 5 r of all pesticides never exceeded r 1 2 in mw 4 5 and 6 except for imidacloprid in mw 5 3 4 retardation versus intra aquifer variations in geochemical properties pesticides observed during the experiment can be divided in 3 groups based on pka and isoelectric point calculations s2 i anionic pesticides which consists of bentazon and cycloxydim ii non ionic hydrophilic pesticides log dow 2 which consist of chloridazon plus its metabolites and imidacloprid and iii non ionic hydrophobic pesticides log dow between 2 and 4 5 which consist of boscalid fluopyram and flutolanil as bentazon and cycloxydim retardation was not significant al3 and fe3 hydroxide borggaard and gimsing 2008 or organic matter kah and brown 2006 tülp et al 2009 sorption of anionic pesticides appear subordinate mechanisms in the current study several prior researches studied sorption of polar pesticides to different soil sorbents sánchez martín and sánchez camazano 1991 studied chloridazon adsorption in 18 different natural soils soc content ranging from 0 05 to 7 70 d w calculated from sedimentary organic matter som content with a conversion factor of 2 0 pribyl 2010 they observed that organic matter content accounted for 72 of the variance in adsorption effects of clay content on extent of adsorption were relatively small cox et al 1997 studied imidacloprid sorption in soils they discovered a strong correlation between kf freundlich partition coefficient and soc content r2 0 995 3 soils soc content ranged from 1 4 4 1 d w cox et al 1998b observed a similar correlation between kf and soc content r2 0 94 for 7 natural soils soc content ranged from 0 29 3 95 d w these findings correspond with the higher r observed for chloridazon and imidacloprid in the current project at the depths with higher soc contents therefore we can assume that soc is the major sorbent for the hydrophilic pesticide group to our knowledge no relevant sorption studies were performed on the sorption of the specific compounds in the hydrophobic pesticide group soc is generally the main sorbent for hydrophobic pesticides fetter et al 1999 wauchope et al 2002 this corresponds with the observed r in this study which mostly increase when soc content increases in the current research pesticide r at the different depths showed the strongest correlations with soc contents compared to the other geochemical parameters table 2 nonetheless all observed geochemical parameters are positively correlated with pesticide r and are also positively correlated with each other we can safely assume that soc is the major sorbent for most pesticides studied as this corresponds with this and prior studies therefore we converted r to organic carbon water partition coefficients koc which are presented in fig 3 at shallow depths mw 1 2 and 3 koc values are remarkably higher than at the depths of mw 4 5 and 6 while koc would be expected in the same range because soc is the main soil sorption parameter therefore we can conclude that the content of soc is not the only factor controlling pesticide sorption the sorption reactivity of soc probably plays a role as well 3 5 in situ field sorption parameters versus literature parameters literature sorption parameters were not available from aquifer studies column or field studies for the pesticides examined except for bentazon e g tuxen et al 2000 r 1 00 madsen et al 2000 r 1 00 1 25 broholm et al 2001a r 1 1 instead obtained r values were compared to sorption parameters retrieved from the ppdb database lewis et al 2016 which is often used in pesticide transport studies e g lefrancq et al 2017 rouzies et al 2019 freundlich sorption parameters were converted to linear kd values applicable for a defined concentration range lowest detection limit 0 005 μg l to maximum concentration in tdw based on eq 6 these freundlich sorption parameters have mostly been obtained from batch experiments with topsoils performed for regulatory purposes kd and koc obtained in this study are both considerably lower for all pesticides than the range retrieved from the ppdb database fig 3 3 6 explanations for low kd and koc and intra aquifer variations temperature aquifer heterogeneity and doc associated transport seem not the cause of the relatively low kd and koc observed as argued in the following sorption generally decreases with increasing temperature delle site 2001 while aquifer temperatures 10 12 c were lower than applicable for standard batch experiments room temperature 20 c aquifer heterogeneity can cause lower sorption than expected clay and soc contents are significantly correlated in this study table 2 which reflects that less permeable and more clayey aquifer section contain the most soc the soc content in the more permeable parts of the aquifer is therefore probably lower than the average soc content determined for these aquifer layers consequently less sorption may be observed than expected based on the soc content of the entire layer we deem in unlikely that the lower sorption is caused by aquifer heterogeneity as small clay layers were only observed at the well screen depth of mw 2 and mw 3 for more information see s4 and relatively low koc were observed at all depths doc associated transport is an additional and often rapid transport pathway for pesticides which can result in an increased mobility fetter et al 1999 it can be indicated by larger velocities of the pesticides than the average groundwater which can result in r 1 0 enfield et al 1989 fetter et al 1999 the larger velocities are resulting from size exclusion effects which are observed as molecules or ions are restricted to travel through larger pores due to their size where groundwater velocities are greater than average fetter et al 1999 this is observed for bentazon d chloridazon md chloridazon and cycloxydim at mw 5 6 and for cycloxydim at mw 3 which could suggest the occurrence of doc associated transport however we deem it unlikely that doc associated transport has more than a minor control at this site as first doc itself does not show r 1 0 while pesticides sorbed to the doc travel with the same speed fig 4 during the field injection experiment sorption and or degradation of doc is suggested by the lower concentrations compared to the conservative concentrations during and after the breakthrough at all depths two analytical solutions were fitted to the observed doc concentrations one simulating only retardation and the other only degradation a clearly better fit was observed for the solution simulating degradation only which suggests that retardation of doc is limited but not 1 0 in this aquifer for more information see s5 second doc associated transport is only likely when a substantial fraction of the pesticide is bound to doc which is unlikely as the pesticides with r 1 0 are the most hydrophilic of those pesticides studied s2 it is therefore unclear which mechanism caused the observed r 1 0 methodological differences and a low sedimentary organic matter som sorption reactivity probably caused the lower sorption observed in this study compared to the ppdb database batch experiments can result in outcomes unrealistic for aquifers as they are often performed with different solid solution ratios and or dissimilar hydrodynamic conditions banzhaf and hebig 2016 limousin et al 2007 a low som sorption reactivity can also result in less sorption and can have different causes such as the oxygen exposure extent of som during and after deposition grathwohl 1990 hartog et al 2004 som chemical composition ahmad et al 2001 karapanagioti et al 2000 coating and masking of som el arfaoui et al 2012 and som aging weber and huang 1996 it is therefore possible that the som sorption reactivity of the aquifer sediments is generally lower than from the experiments performed for the sorption parameters in the ppdb database furthermore we observed remarkably lower koc values at shallow depths mw 4 5 and 6 compared to mw 1 2 and 3 the higher koc at shallower depths correspond to the aeolian and fluvial aquifer sediments of the boxtel formation we assume that the higher koc at the shallow depths are mainly caused by a higher som sorption reactivity in these aquifer sediments compared to the marine and glacial sediments from the other formations eems and drenthe composing the aquifer 3 7 insights on mar operation and groundwater risk management obtaining in situ r is only possible while performing a field injection experiment if there is a distinct difference in pesticide concentration between the infiltrated water and ambient groundwater and if degradation can be ruled out the easiest and often only possibility to perform this experiment is at the start of mar operation although r does not necessarily stay constant afterwards pesticides were more mobile in this aquifer than expected based on literature sorption parameters from the ppdb database this shows the large uncertainty which is involved by using literature sorption parameters to assess pesticide transport in aquifers the relatively low r observed in this study can both be a positive and negative outcome for as t r operation at this location low r simplifies restoration of the aquifer to native conditions after as t r operation is stopped as it is easier to reclaim the injected pesticides contrarily injected pesticides travel further within the aquifer which increases the risk of groundwater contamination in the current study the pesticides examined were originating from agricultural use pesticide legislation changed considerably in the last decades which resulted in a large group of new pesticides applied there is insufficient knowledge of the fate of currently used pesticides in aquifers more field pesticide sorption studies are needed to better understand transport of these present day approved pesticides in aquifers we show the large impacts of aquifer heterogeneity on pesticide mobility in the current study intra aquifer variations in hydraulic conductivity resulted in large variations in pesticide mobility for example in mw 6 almost 4 the water volume was injected before arrival occurred compared to mw 4 these variations in mobility were strengthened by pesticide sorption a low permeability is related to a higher clay content and clay content is here significantly positively correlated with soc therefore aquifer parts with high permeability show often less pesticide sorption than low permeability parts taking aquifer heterogeneity in account is essential for an appropriate groundwater risk assessment as pesticide mobility can vary substantially within an aquifer 4 conclusion in this study we determined sorption parameters of 7 commonly applied pesticides and 2 regularly detected metabolites during a field injection experiment in an aquifer with a wide range of sedimentary organic carbon contents this experiment was performed at 6 depths which enabled us to assess the effects and implications of variations in sorption lastly we compared the obtained sorption parameters to a widely used literature database retardation factors r were obtained by fitting observed pesticide concentrations to an advection dispersion equation using a non linear least squares routine at each depth the results were not influenced by pesticide degradation during the experiment the most mobile pesticides were bentazon and cycloxydim with r 1 1 at all depths the pesticides desphenyl chloridazon methyl desphenyl chloridazon and imidacloprid were generally less mobile with a maximum r observed of 1 5 least mobile were the pesticides boscalid chloridazon fluopyram and flutolanil which showed a larger range of r with a maximum of r 2 0 pesticide retardation was largest in the shallow aquifer and decreased in the deeper aquifer the comparison of the pesticide sorption parameters with the literature database showed that sorption in the currently researched aquifer was remarkably lower than expected based on the sorption parameters obtained mostly from batch experiments in the pesticide sorption database the lower sorption observed in this research was most likely resulting from a lower sorption reactivity of sedimentary organic matter in the studied aquifer and or a dissimilar solid solution ratio and hydrodynamic conditions during the batch experiments compared to the aquifer studied the relatively low r observed can be positive for aquifer storage transfer and recovery as it is easier to reclaim all injected pesticides after operation on the other hand pesticides advance further into the aquifer which increases the risk of groundwater contamination besides the decreasing r with depth we also observed a decrease of koc with depth we think it is likely that the variation in koc results from variations in sorption reactivity of the sedimentary organic matter this study shows large intra aquifer variations in pesticide sorption which demonstrates the importance of taking aquifer heterogeneity in account for appropriate groundwater risk assessments credit authorship

1301,pathogenic bacteria can be discharged in the environment through natural as well as anthropogenic activities once in the environment they may contaminate soil and sediments and migrate towards water bodies transient chemical conditions may occur in soil sediments and favor mobilization of bacteria e g upon the reduction of salinity or ionic strength however the magnitude of this phenomenon and its relationship with particle size is not well understood yet in this work we investigated the transport of escherichia coli under variable salinity conditions between 1 and 20 part per thousand ppt and for different soil grain sizes between 150 and 710 μm a model developed in our group was applied in this work it couples bacteria and salinity transport equations in order to account for transient water composition in the description of bacteria migration the model was calibrated and validated with laboratory experiments the tests were monitored continuously with uv vis spectroscopy which allowed to record highly resolved concentration fronts the results show that salinity increases the retardation of the bacteria upon salinity drop a release of bacteria occurs forming a peak whose magnitude increases with salinity change this effect becomes more important as the grain size decreases simulations suggest that the dominant retention mechanism is attachment for coarse sand and straining for fine sand the retention can be reversed as the salinity is reduced causing a sudden bacteria mobilization such a behaviour may have important implications on microbial contamination of water bodies when soil sediments undergo transient chemical conditions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bacteria escherichia coli microbial contamination modeling transport in porous media salinity 1 introduction the understanding of the effect of salinity on the transport behaviour of pathogenic bacteria in porous media is relevant to a large variety of problems in engineering and science e g wastewater use in crop irrigation verbyla et al 2016 ibekwe et al 2018 liang et al 2020 drainage of sewage and stormwater dila et al 2018 wolfand et al 2018 carney et al 2020 and groundwater and river sediment contamination bravo et al 2017 jurado et al 2019 murphy et al 2020 reynolds et al 2020 stokdyk et al 2020 for instance studies in urbanized wetlands have shown the evidence of accumulation and growth of pathogens within the sediments upon a rain event or during high tide which change the water chemistry a microbial contamination was observed within the water column solo gabriele et al 2000 desmarais et al 2002 evanson and ambrose 2006 byappanahalli et al 2012 pathogenic bacteria comprise microorganisms such as e coli enterococci fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci which live in the lower intestine of animals and humans and can become harmful to human health if ingested through contaminated water or food once released into the environment they may accumulate grow die off and mobilize the controlling mechanisms of bacteria transport in porous media are advection dispersion attachment detachment onto a surface straining at a constriction and decay attachment detachment relates to the interfacial forces between the microorganisms and the porous media surface ginn et al 2002 redman et al 2004 bradford et al 2014 while straining refers to the trapping of the bacteria cells in down gradient pore throats that are too narrow to allow microbial passage mcdowell boyer et al 1986 the magnitude of retention within a porous medium is regulated by several biological and physico chemical factors such as microorganism species and concentration fluid velocity grain size and type and thermodynamic conditions temperature and solution composition chen and zhu 2004 kim et al 2009 kim and walker 2009 li et al 2017 in this work we focus on the study of the effect of grain size and salinity on the transport of e coli the former may vary across the domain of interest due to soil heterogeneity the latter may change over time because of e g weather intermittent watering and tide small grain size can favor attachment because of the large surface available for adhesion as well as it may favor straining due to the small aspect ratio between the pore throat size and the bacteria and or bacteria clusters size bradford et al 2003 foppen and schijven 2005 bradford and bettahar 2006 foppen et al 2007 bai et al 2016 in the presence of high salinity or ionic strength attachment and straining are expected to increase due to the electrostatic interactions between the bacteria and the porous medium surface and among the bacteria cells jewett et al 1995 torkzaban et al 2008 redman et al 2004 e coli is used as indicator of fecal contamination and model bacteria in several studies because e coli can survive for few days when released into the environment earlier studies bradford and bettahar 2006 foppen et al 2007 chen and walker 2012 mitropoulou et al 2013 bai et al 2016 on e coli transport in saturated and unsaturated porous media focused either on grain size or on salinity in isolated manner few works torkzaban et al 2008 díaz et al 2010 have coupled experimental observations with modeling for instance in the work by massoudieh et al 2013 the authors used the a step wise bayesian hierarchical method to estimate model parameters from experiments and evaluate the adequacy of different model structures however in all these studies the salinity has often been maintained constant throughout the tests and the conditions applied did not resemble the salinity change potentially occurring in agricultural fields or coastal areas where microbial contamination may be critical tosco et al 2009 studied the effect of variable salinity on particle transport in their work they did not use bacteria but rather latex microparticles functionalized with negatively charged carboxyl groups moreover they did not investigate the effect of sand size bradford et al 2015 studied the effect of variable salinity on bacteria transport but they did not consider the effect of sand size and the salinity was changed within the narrow range of 0 7 part per thousand ppt our work aimed at filling this gap while applying a modeling approach developed in our group where the mass conservation equations are coupled mathematically through the constitutive equations such a coupling provides more sensitivity to the model towards the change of the chemical conditions as it was demonstrated in our earlier paper where uncoupled and coupled models were compared zhang et al 2019 in this paper an experimental and modeling work is presented to investigate the transport of bacteria through quartz sand in various size ranges and for a salinity change up to 20 ppt which resembles salinity in coastal aquifers jiao and post 2019 laboratory experiments continuously monitored with uv vis spectroscopy were run a model developed in our group zhang et al 2019 which couples mathematically bacteria and salinity mass conservation laws was used the attachment detachment and straining processes were treated explicitly by two distinct constitutive equations to identify the dominant mechanism of retention and the role of salinity and grain size on bacteria transport behaviour 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacteria suspension and characterization e coli is a proteobacteria characterized by a rod shape of 0 5 2 μm width and 1 5 μm length attached to their cytoplasmic membrane they have pili which help their attachment onto surfaces pepper et al 2011 some strains of e coli e g o157 h7 and o104 h4 are pathogenic and have caused in the past serious outbreaks those with flagella are also motile pepper et al 2011 in this work a non pathogenic strain of escherichia coli atcc 13706 was selected as representative bacteria for this work e coli atcc 13706 is a gram negative and a non motile bacterial strain the cells are rod shaped non flagellated and with a z average diameter between 0 9 and 2 3 μm measured using dynamic light scattering dls method zetasizer nano zs zen 3600 malvern panalytical in disposable 120 μl cuvettes the measurement was repeated at least three times the measurement of the zeta potential ζ v of the bacteria was carried out using micro electrophoresis zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd to this aim a suspension of e coli with concentration equal to 4 107 cfu ml and salinity varied between 5 and 15 ppt was created the ph was adjusted between 5 and 9 using either hydrochloric acid hcl sigma aldrich u s a or sodium hydroxide naoh sigma aldrich u s a 2 2 quartz sand ottawa sand sigma aldrich u s a with average particle size of 150 350 and 710 μm determined by sieving was used in this work the values of ζ were measured upon pulverization of the sand in a planetary ball mill fritsch u s a then an amount of 0 4 g of grounded ottawa sand was suspended in 10 ml of the electrolyte nacl solution the ph was adjusted between 5 and 9 2 3 uv vis spectroscopic measurements optical density od measurements are the standard approach used in microbiology for the characterization of bacteria suspensions uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent u s a was used in this work to determine the concentration of bacteria during the experiments the accuracy of the device is 10 as reported in the technical manual the intensity of the absorbance at 600 nm was used generally identifies as od600 i e optical density 600 different wavelength values have been selected to measure bacteria concentration in suspensions namely 600 nm biesta peters et al 2010 schinner et al 2010 wang et al 2013 shao et al 2016 460 nm sasidharan et al 2016 240 nm torkzaban et al 2008 and 280 nm redman et al 2004 however wavelength in the range of 400 470 nm has been observed to inactivate several bacteria species wang et al 2017b dai et al 2012 and short wavelengths such as 240 nm may damage the cell tissue masuma et al 2013 therefore we performed preliminary tests to measure the absorption spectrum of e coli at various salinity in order to understand the sensitivity of the absorbance to bacteria in suspension in the presence of salt comparing the absorbance at selected wavelengths namely 240 400 and 600 nm together with the calculated area of the spectrum between 210 and 800 nm we observed that at 600 nm the absorbance was sensitive to the bacteria in suspension with no disturbance by the salt and that around 200 nm there was a significant influence of nacl concentration therefore in this work we selected a wavelength of 600 nm to determine the concentration of e coli in suspension in all the experiments prior to the experiment a calibration curve was determined to convert absorbance into concentration at salinity values as in the injected solutions used in the experiments described below section 1 of the supporting information si document reports the uv vis measurements taken during these preliminary tests together with the calibration curves 2 4 determination of the decay rate of bacteria measurements of the decay rate of e coli for 1 10 15 and 20 ppt over 18 h were carried out which is approximately the duration of the experiments four bacterial suspensions with salinity equal to 1 10 15 and 20 ppt were prepared the samples were taken from the suspensions every two hours and the concentration of e coli was determined by the epa standard method 1604 usepa 2002 the single laboratory precision coefficient of variation ranged from 3 3 to 27 3 as reported in the method protocol usepa 2002 2 5 sep up and column flood experiments a set up was built to perform column flood experiments to investigate the transport behaviour of e coli under the influence of salinity and particle size a scheme of the set up is shown in fig 1 we used a chromatography column omnifit u k of length 12 cm and with an inner diameter equal to 1 6 cm before each test the column was dry packed with ottawa sand sigma aldrich u s a of homogeneous properties online sensors endress hauser u s a to measure conductivity ph and temperature were installed along the inlet and outlet tubes the suspension composition in terms of e coli concentration was continuously characterized using a uv vis spectrophotometer located downstream of the phmeter a flow through cell of 10 mm pathlength and volume of 0 46 cm3 was placed in the instrument and the sample scanned to determine the absorbance within 200 and 800 nm the measurement was recorded every 30 s a fraction collector was used to collect grab samples and measure the e coli using the epa standard method 1604 usepa 2002 the average flow velocity v was always set equal to 0 5 ml min around 4 107 cfu ml concentration of e coli atcc 13706 was dispersed in a solution of sodium chloride nacl sigma aldrich u s a with salinity equal to 1 10 15 and 20 ppt adjusted by adding known amounts of nacl and considering c s 1 81 10 3 c cl with c s salinity ppt and c cl chloride concentration mg l more in detail prior to an experiment a suspension of bacterial colony was taken from a pure culture plate and inoculated into 50 ml of tryptic soya broth thermofisher u s a the inoculated suspension was grown at 37 c for 15 18 h while mixed on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm cells were then separated from the suspension using a centrifuge at 3500g for 30 min at 4 c the pellet formed upon centrifuge was re suspended in a solution of nacl and centrifuged again bacterial cells were double washed with the electrolyte solution to ensure removal of the medium used for growth the bacterial pellet was then re suspended into a solution of nacl to achieve a final absorbance of 0 12 counts at a wavelength of 600 nm determined with a spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent u s a this absorbance corresponds to an initial bacterial influent concentration of approximately 4 107 cfu ml two types of experiments were run namely i experiments at constant salinity to derive concentration fronts of e coli to be used in the calibration of the model and ii experiments at variable salinity to verify the calibrated model in the constant salinity experiments the column was flooded with a solution containing selected concentrations of nacl resulting in salinity values between 1 and 20 ppt corresponding to ionic strength between 0 02 and 0 31 mol kg initially the brine was injected until the values of conductivity and ph measured in the outlet stream equaled those in the inlet stream once the system reached equilibrium a suspension brine with a concentration of e coli equal to 4 107 cfu ml and salinity equal to that of the initial injected solution was supplied to the column the injection of the brine lasted approximately 175 pv i e pv qt nv where q is the flow rate m3 s t is the time s n is the porosity and v is the total volume of the porous medium within the column m3 the value of 175 pv corresponds to 17 h approximately once the system stabilized under this condition the initial brine was supplied again to the column until the bacteria concentration reached zero the experiments under constant salinity were conducted with sand of average grain size equal to 150 350 and 710 μm in the experiments where salinity was varied the column was initially stabilized with a brine of 1 ppt salinity until the values of conductivity and ph measured at the outlet equaled those in the inlet after the system reached equilibrium a suspension brine with a concentration of e coli equal to 4 107 cfu ml and salinity between 5 and 20 ppt was injected into the column for approximately 175 pv then the initial solution was injected again 3 transport model the mass conservation laws for bacteria and solute transport in porous media for one dimensional 1d single phase flow write herzig et al 1970 matthess and pekdeger 1981 powelson and mills 2001 bradford et al 2003 bradford and bettahar 2006 1 c t ρ n s att t s str t v c x d 2 c x 2 0 2 c s t v c s x d 2 c s x 2 0 where 0 x l is the longitudinal coordinate m with l the length of the domain c is the bacteria concentration given in colony forming unit per unit volume cfu ml c s is the salinity ppt ρ is the bulk density of the porous medium g cm3 s att and s str are the concentrations of microorganisms retained within the porous medium surface cfu g due to attachment detachment and straining respectively which control the bacteria mass transfer at the solid liquid interface bos et al 1999 and the mechanical retention at the pore throat adamczyk et al 1994 johnson and elimelech 1995 the constitutive equations for these processes write respectively as herzig et al 1970 matthess and pekdeger 1981 powelson and mills 2001 bradford et al 2003 bradford and bettahar 2006 3 ρ n s att t k att c ρ n k det s att 4 ρ n s str t k str 1 s str s max c where k att and k det represent correspondingly the attachment and detachment coefficients 1 min k str is the straining coefficient 1 min and s max is the maximum concentration that can be retained by straining in the porous medium cfu g eq 1 through 4 were discretized using an implicit finite difference method backward in space and forward in time and then implemented in matlab matlab 2020 the discretized system of equations was solved iterativelly using the newton raphson method further details about the numerical discretization implementation numerical coupling as well as the verification of the numerics with analytical solution are reported in our earlier work zhang et al 2019 the attachment detachment and straining processes are affected by the type of bacteria aqueous chemistry and the type and size of the granular material bai et al 2016 wang et al 2013 foppen et al 2007 therefore the values of the model parameters namely k att k det k str and s max may change accordingly in this work we estimated the values of the model parameters by inverting the model on the measurements carried out during experiments run at constant salinity in this way mathematical relationships between the estimated parameters and the salinity could be determined at each selected grain size the inversion of the transport model eq 1 through 4 on the measurements was carried out using the matlab function nlinfit matlab 2020 to the best of our knowledge there are only few works where bacteria and solute transport equations have been combined mathematically bradford et al 2015 tosco et al 2009 in order to describe the dynamics of the bacteria concentration under variable chemical conditions these works have a different approach for model calibration and no validation was performed in this work the model was instead calibrated under controlled conditions of grain size and salinity and then verified with experiments under variable salinity 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization and calibration the size of the bacteria was determined with dls measurements the average diameter was 1 42 0 07 μm the values of ζ for the bacteria and the ottawa sand were measured at ph and salinity within the intervals employed in this work the measured values were always negative and varied between 7 and 20 mv for the bacteria and 7 and 35 mv for the sand fig 2 prior to the experiments a calibration curve was built to convert absorbance into concentration since the relationship between optical density 600 nm od600 and biomass concentration is not linear it only approximates to linearity at low od values therefore the calibration was determined by using bacteria concentration with od less than 1 the results are shown in fig 3 4 2 decay rate of bacteria the work by carlucci and pramer carlucci and pramer 1960 reports that in 48 h approximately 90 of the bacteria can decay in seawater salinity 35 ppt therefore we run tests to analyze the decay rate by measuring the bacteria concentration using the epa standard method 1604 usepa 2002 that allows to quantify the alive bacteria fraction the results are reported in fig 4 assuming first order kinetics and the rate constants were determined upon fitting and they correspond to 0 028 0 019 0 045 and 0 059 h 1 for the tests at 1 10 15 and 20 ppt respectively the decay starts to become important around 15 and 20 ppt therefore giving the literature and our calculations we selected 20 ppt as the maximum salinity for our tests 4 3 transport experiments table 1 lists all the conditions applied in the transport experiments specifically the table reports the values of the average particle size of the sand ψ μm the initial and the injected concentration of salt c s ini and c s inj respectively the injected concentration of bacteria c inj cells ml and the ph in the initial solution and in the injected suspension the average flow velocity v m s and the hydrodynamic dispersion d m2 s were estimated with tracer tests prior each injection and their values were equal to respectively 3 10 4 1 2 10 5 m s and 5 10 6 2 2 10 6 m2 s the porosity n of the medium was determined gravimetrically and it was between 0 35 and 0 40 the temperature of the injected and withdrawn fluids were controlled by the a c system of the laboratory room and maintained around 22 c 4 3 1 constant salinity the bacteria and salinity concentrations are reported in fig 5 in conjunction with the model upon optimization here the normalized effluent concentration of e coli is plotted against the number of pvs as it possible to see in fig 5 the larger the salinity the lower the normalized concentration at the outlet this is because as salinity increases the attachment of bacteria onto the porous medium surface is favored torkzaban et al 2008 as well as the aggregation of bacteria that are retained by mechanical straining at the pore throats kim et al 2009 jagmann et al 2015 resulting in a greater retention of e coli within the porous medium at given salinity e g 10 ppt parts g h and f the maximum normalized concentration at the outlet increases from approximately 0 2 to 0 8 0 9 as the sand size increases from 150 to 710 μm this is because as the particle size increases there is a smaller surface area available for attachment and larger permeability of the medium wang et al 2017a causing lower filter capacity of the porous medium all the measurements performed at constant salinity were used to determine the parameter values namely k att k str k det and s max n inj with n inj the bacteria count per unit volume of injected suspension and identify their relationship with the salinity fig 6 shows the estimates the parameters related to attachment and straining i e k att k str and s max n inj increase with salinity and decreasing grain size while those related to detachment i e k det decreases with salinity and with decreasing particle size simple mathematical relationships were formulated to describe the trend of the parameters 5 k att α 1 c s c s α 2 6 k det α 3 c s α 4 7 k str α 5 c s 8 s max n inj α 6 c s 1 α 7 c s where α 1 through α 7 are positive numbers these relationships couple mathematically the transport equation of bacteria eq 1 and salinity eq 2 the r2 calculated upon the fitting of the parameters is between 0 78 and 0 99 the estimated model parameters compare well to those in the literature foppen et al 2007 bai et al 2016 at similar salinity section 4 of the si document except for the attachment coefficient which is much smaller than that in this work this is because attachment is the most sensitive to salinity and becomes negligible as salinity vanishes 4 3 2 variable salinity in this section the experimental results from experiments run at variable salinity table 1 are reported and discussed figs 7 through 9 show the experimental results together with simulations using the calibrated model for each test reported in the figures the top diagram reports the measured bacteria and salinity concentrations in conjunction with model simulation results while the bottom diagram shows the trend of the pressure difference i e δp p i p o where p i and p o are the pressure at the inlet and the outlet respectively and the ph at the outlet in all tests the ph varies within a narrow range i e 5 and 6 fig 7 shows that as the salinity increases from 5 to 15 ppt the normalized concentration c c inj at the outlet decreases and the bacteria concentration front becomes more retarded at salinity equal to 15 ppt c c inj is nearly zero suggesting almost complete retention of the bacteria in the porous medium however despite of the significant bacteria retention the pressure difference is almost constant indicating that attachment and straining do not affect the permeability of the porous medium upon salinity drop two concentration peaks form we believe that they are due to two mechanisms of bacteria mobilization namely a rapid reverse straining process followed by slower detachment overall the bacteria concentration increase due to the injection of low salinity brine reaching values up to 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the injected fluid this observation confirms that a significant amount of bacteria was retained in the porous medium even if the pressure across the column remained almost constant release due to salinity drop can be explained by the trend of the zeta potential of the bacteria and sand as the salinity decreases the zeta potential increases resulting in a greater surface charge that inhibits inter particle attraction due to van der walls forces and therefore less retention of the bacteria in the porous medium shen et al 2018 fig 8 reports the results from tests run with sand of average grain size equal to 350 μm here no retardation in the bacteria concentration fronts can be observed the fronts breakthrough at 1 pv and reach a plateau soon afterwards however the normalized concentration does not reach 1 in all cases because of the slow attachment process that has not reach equilibrium yet for salinity of the injected suspension equal to 15 ppt a concentration peak starts to appear in the measurements as the conditions are reversed the model predicts a peak formation already for the injected suspension equal to 10 ppt this discrepancy could be due to the detection method it is important to point out that the magnitude of the peaks measured and predicted in exp 21 and 22 are much smaller than those in exp 6 and 7 at the same conditions but performed using finer sand finally fig 9 reports the results from tests run with sand of average grain size equal to 710 μm similar observations can be made regarding the effect of salinity on bacteria transport as those made for the tests run using sand of 350 μ m grain size no retardation in the concentration front was recorded and a peak upon salinity reduction was measured and predicted for injected salinity larger than 10 ppt no peak is observed at the lowest injected salinity value due to the negligible concentration of the retained bacteria in the column effluents during the experiments run at the largest salinity were also characterized using the plating method epa standard method 1604 usepa 2002 to verify the decay during the tests during the mobilization it is possible to see in fig 10 the concentrations determined with the two methods agree very well confirming overall the calibrated model predicts well the overall concentration front and to the best of our knowledge this is the first work where bacteria and solute transport equations have been coupled mathematically through the constitutive equations in order to describe the dynamics of the bacteria concentration under variable chemical conditions however in few cases the magnitude of the peak is either under predicted e g part c of fig 7 or over predicted e g part e of fig 8 improvement in the predictions could be made by calibrating the model over a larger dataset the calculated r2 is between 0 6 and 0 85 4 4 total mass of bacteria retained the reversibility of the retention of bacteria inside the column was calculated through mass balance of the measurements and model data the process was not completely reversible as the calculated accumulation varies between 0 and 98 with the largest value calculated for exp 4 where the finest sand and the largest salinity were used moreover using the calibrated model we determined the diagrams of the total mass of bacteria retained into the column and released from the column as a function of grain size and salinity as it possible to see in fig 11 both the retained and the detached mass increase with salinity and they reach a maximum at the smallest particle size retention in fine soil is generally associated to a larger surface area of the particles that favors attachment balkhair 2017 moreover the pore structure may play an important role in the bacteria retention process torkzaban et al 2008 suggested that increasing ionic strength causes larger retention of bacteria due to the increase of attraction forces between bacteria and the surface favoring adhesion at stagnant points within the pores in addition considering a characteristic length of e coli equal to 2 0 μm and an average pore throat size of 5 20 100 μm for 150 350 and 710 μm respectively nelson 2009 straining process is expected to become more important with decreasing size moreover at high salinity bacteria may agglomerate flocculate creating large clusters enhancing even further straining mcgregor and finn 1969 zita and hermansson 1994 4 5 parametric analysis of the model to understand which of the two mechanisms dominate retention under the applied conditions we performed a parametric analysis of the model eq 5 through 8 were multiplied to highlight the change in the behaviour of bacteria upon amplification of one model parameter at the time the results are shown in fig 12 here the parameter functions for the 350 μm size sand were changed one at the time to analyze the influence of a parameter on the bacteria transport behaviour for instance in part a of this figure eq 5 was scaled by a factor of 2 5 and 4 while eq 6 through 8 were maintained same increasing k att the only major effect is the magnitude of the peak upon salinity drop which increases up to almost 4 fold part c of this figure shows the results when changing k str as the parameter value increases the retardation of the normalized concentration decreases and the peak magnitude increases similar analysis was carried out by foppen et al 2007 through t value statistic they observed the t values of the k a were the highest suggesting that the major retention mechanism was attachment in our work contrarily by comparing the effect of parameter change on concentration profile we can notice that straining is the mechanism responsible for the strong retardation and the high peak formation in particular during experiments run using the finest sand and applying the largest salinity drop the change of the other two model parameters does not influence significantly the concentration fronts overall this indicates that attachment and straining are dominant processes under different conditions i e in the presence of coarse and fine sand respectively 5 conclusions this paper presents an experimental and modeling work to understand the effect of variable salinity conditions between 1 and 20 ppt on escherichia coli transport through fine and coarse sand a coupled mathematical model developed earlier in our group was used to describe the transport behaviour under variable salinity conditions a column flood system was built to run experiments using sand of difference grain size the model was calibrated with experiments at constant salinity and validated with tests where salinity was changed the model compares well with the experimental results and shows that salinity increases the retardation of the bacteria concentration front and the larger the drop of salinity the larger the released bacteria concentration this effect becomes more important as the grain size decreases and at the smallest size and at the largest tested salinity value the dominant mechanism of retention appears to be straining which is completely reversed as the salinity is reduced such a behaviour may be common in other bacterial phenotypes with a different extent however this was not investigated in this work this work suggests that mathematical coupling of transport equations for bacteria and salinity helps predict important features of bacteria migration in porous media such as sharp concentration peaks

1301,pathogenic bacteria can be discharged in the environment through natural as well as anthropogenic activities once in the environment they may contaminate soil and sediments and migrate towards water bodies transient chemical conditions may occur in soil sediments and favor mobilization of bacteria e g upon the reduction of salinity or ionic strength however the magnitude of this phenomenon and its relationship with particle size is not well understood yet in this work we investigated the transport of escherichia coli under variable salinity conditions between 1 and 20 part per thousand ppt and for different soil grain sizes between 150 and 710 μm a model developed in our group was applied in this work it couples bacteria and salinity transport equations in order to account for transient water composition in the description of bacteria migration the model was calibrated and validated with laboratory experiments the tests were monitored continuously with uv vis spectroscopy which allowed to record highly resolved concentration fronts the results show that salinity increases the retardation of the bacteria upon salinity drop a release of bacteria occurs forming a peak whose magnitude increases with salinity change this effect becomes more important as the grain size decreases simulations suggest that the dominant retention mechanism is attachment for coarse sand and straining for fine sand the retention can be reversed as the salinity is reduced causing a sudden bacteria mobilization such a behaviour may have important implications on microbial contamination of water bodies when soil sediments undergo transient chemical conditions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords bacteria escherichia coli microbial contamination modeling transport in porous

and science e g wastewater use in crop irrigation verbyla et al 2016 ibekwe et al 2018 liang et al 2020 drainage of sewage and stormwater dila et al 2018 wolfand et al 2018 carney et al 2020 and groundwater and river sediment contamination bravo et al 2017 jurado et al 2019 murphy et al 2020 reynolds et al 2020 stokdyk et al 2020 for instance studies in urbanized wetlands have shown the evidence of accumulation and growth of pathogens within the sediments upon a rain event or during high tide which change the water chemistry a microbial contamination was observed within the water column solo gabriele et al 2000 desmarais et al 2002 evanson and ambrose 2006 byappanahalli et al 2012 pathogenic bacteria comprise microorganisms such as e coli enterococci fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci which live in the lower intestine of animals and humans and can become harmful to human health if ingested through contaminated water or food once released into the environment they may accumulate grow die off and mobilize the controlling mechanisms of bacteria transport in porous media are advection dispersion attachment detachment onto a surface straining at a constriction and decay attachment detachment relates to the interfacial forces between the microorganisms and the porous media surface ginn et al 2002 redman et al 2004 bradford et al 2014 while straining refers to the trapping of the bacteria cells in down gradient pore throats that are too narrow to allow microbial passage mcdowell boyer et al 1986 the magnitude of retention within a porous medium is regulated by several biological and physico chemical factors such as microorganism species and concentration fluid velocity grain size and type and thermodynamic conditions temperature and solution composition chen and zhu 2004 kim et al 2009 kim and walker 2009 li et al 2017 in this work we focus on the study of the effect of grain size and salinity on the transport of e coli the former may vary across the domain of interest due to soil heterogeneity the latter may change over time because of e g weather intermittent watering and tide small grain size can favor attachment because of the large surface available for adhesion as well as it may favor straining due to the small aspect ratio between the pore throat size and the bacteria and or bacteria clusters size bradford et al 2003 foppen and schijven 2005 bradford and bettahar 2006 foppen et al 2007 bai et al 2016 in the presence of high salinity or ionic strength attachment and straining are expected to increase due to the electrostatic interactions between the bacteria and the porous medium surface and among the bacteria cells jewett et al 1995 torkzaban et al 2008 redman et al 2004 e coli is used as indicator of fecal contamination and model bacteria in several studies because e coli can survive for few days when released into the environment earlier studies bradford and bettahar 2006 foppen et al 2007 chen and walker 2012 mitropoulou et al 2013 bai et al 2016 on e coli transport in saturated and unsaturated porous media focused either on grain size or on salinity in isolated manner few works torkzaban et al 2008 díaz et al 2010 have coupled experimental observations with modeling for instance in the work by massoudieh et al 2013 the authors used the a step wise bayesian hierarchical method to estimate model parameters from experiments and evaluate the adequacy of different model structures however in all these studies the salinity has often been maintained constant throughout the tests and the conditions applied did not resemble the salinity change potentially occurring in agricultural fields or coastal areas where microbial contamination may be critical tosco et al 2009 studied the effect of variable salinity on particle transport in their work they did not use bacteria but rather latex microparticles functionalized with negatively charged carboxyl groups moreover they did not investigate the effect of sand size bradford et al 2015 studied the effect of variable salinity on bacteria transport but they did not consider the effect of sand size and the salinity was changed within the narrow range of 0 7 part per thousand ppt our work aimed at filling this gap while applying a modeling approach developed in our group where the mass conservation equations are coupled mathematically through the constitutive equations such a coupling provides more sensitivity to the model towards the change of the chemical conditions as it was demonstrated in our earlier paper where uncoupled and coupled models were compared zhang et al 2019 in this paper an experimental and modeling work is presented to investigate the transport of bacteria through quartz sand in various size ranges and for a salinity change up to 20 ppt which resembles salinity in coastal aquifers jiao and post 2019 laboratory experiments continuously monitored with uv vis spectroscopy were run a model developed in our group zhang et al 2019 which couples mathematically bacteria and salinity mass conservation laws was used the attachment detachment and straining processes were treated explicitly by two distinct constitutive equations to identify the dominant mechanism of retention and the role of salinity and grain size on bacteria transport behaviour 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacteria suspension and characterization e coli is a proteobacteria characterized by a rod shape of 0 5 2 μm width and 1 5 μm length attached to their cytoplasmic membrane they have pili which help their attachment onto surfaces pepper et al 2011 some strains of e coli e g o157 h7 and o104 h4 are pathogenic and have caused in the past serious outbreaks those with flagella are also motile pepper et al 2011 in this work a non pathogenic strain of escherichia coli atcc 13706 was selected as representative bacteria for this work e coli atcc 13706 is a gram negative and a non motile bacterial strain the cells are rod shaped non flagellated and with a z average diameter between 0 9 and 2 3 μm measured using dynamic light scattering dls method zetasizer nano zs zen 3600 malvern panalytical in disposable 120 μl cuvettes the measurement was repeated at least three times the measurement of the zeta potential ζ v of the bacteria was carried out using micro electrophoresis zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd to this aim a suspension of e coli with concentration equal to 4 107 cfu ml and salinity varied between 5 and 15 ppt was created the ph was adjusted between 5 and 9 using either hydrochloric acid hcl sigma aldrich u s a or sodium hydroxide naoh sigma aldrich u s a 2 2 quartz sand ottawa sand sigma aldrich u s a with average particle size of 150 350 and 710 μm determined by sieving was used in this work the values of ζ were measured upon pulverization of the sand in a planetary ball mill fritsch u s a then an amount of 0 4 g of grounded ottawa sand was suspended in 10 ml of the electrolyte nacl solution the ph was adjusted between 5 and 9 2 3 uv vis spectroscopic measurements optical density od measurements are the standard approach used in microbiology for the characterization of bacteria suspensions uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent u s a was used in this work to determine the concentration of bacteria during the experiments the accuracy of the device is 10 as reported in the technical manual the intensity of the absorbance at 600 nm was used generally identifies as od600 i e optical density 600 different wavelength values have been selected to measure bacteria concentration in suspensions namely 600 nm biesta peters et al 2010 schinner et al 2010 wang et al 2013 shao et al 2016 460 nm sasidharan et al 2016 240 nm torkzaban et al 2008 and 280 nm redman et al 2004 however wavelength in the range of 400 470 nm has been observed to inactivate several bacteria species wang et al 2017b dai et al 2012 and short wavelengths such as 240 nm may damage the cell tissue masuma et al 2013 therefore we performed preliminary tests to measure the absorption spectrum of e coli at various salinity in order to understand the sensitivity of the absorbance to bacteria in suspension in the presence of salt comparing the absorbance at selected wavelengths namely 240 400 and 600 nm together with the calculated area of the spectrum between 210 and 800 nm we observed that at 600 nm the absorbance was sensitive to the bacteria in suspension with no disturbance by the salt and that around 200 nm there was a significant influence of nacl concentration therefore in this work we selected a wavelength of 600 nm to determine the concentration of e coli in suspension in all the experiments prior to the experiment a calibration curve was determined to convert absorbance into concentration at salinity values as in the injected solutions used in the experiments described below section 1 of the supporting information si document reports the uv vis measurements taken during these preliminary tests together with the calibration curves 2 4 determination of the decay rate of bacteria measurements of the decay rate of e coli for 1 10 15 and 20 ppt over 18 h were carried out which is approximately the duration of the experiments four bacterial suspensions with salinity equal to 1 10 15 and 20 ppt were prepared the samples were taken from the suspensions every two hours and the concentration of e coli was determined by the epa standard method 1604 usepa 2002 the single laboratory precision coefficient of variation ranged from 3 3 to 27 3 as reported in the method protocol usepa 2002 2 5 sep up and column flood experiments a set up was built to perform column flood experiments to investigate the transport behaviour of e coli under the influence of salinity and particle size a scheme of the set up is shown in fig 1 we used a chromatography column omnifit u k of length 12 cm and with an inner diameter equal to 1 6 cm before each test the column was dry packed with ottawa sand sigma aldrich u s a of homogeneous properties online sensors endress hauser u s a to measure conductivity ph and temperature were installed along the inlet and outlet tubes the suspension composition in terms of e coli concentration was continuously characterized using a uv vis spectrophotometer located downstream of the phmeter a flow through cell of 10 mm pathlength and volume of 0 46 cm3 was placed in the instrument and the sample scanned to determine the absorbance within 200 and 800 nm the measurement was recorded every 30 s a fraction collector was used to collect grab samples and measure the e coli using the epa standard method 1604 usepa 2002 the average flow velocity v was always set equal to 0 5 ml min around 4 107 cfu ml concentration of e coli atcc 13706 was dispersed in a solution of sodium chloride nacl sigma aldrich u s a with salinity equal to 1 10 15 and 20 ppt adjusted by adding known amounts of nacl and considering c s 1 81 10 3 c cl with c s salinity ppt and c cl chloride concentration mg l more in detail prior to an experiment a suspension of bacterial colony was taken from a pure culture plate and inoculated into 50 ml of tryptic soya broth thermofisher u s a the inoculated suspension was grown at 37 c for 15 18 h while mixed on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm cells were then separated from the suspension using a centrifuge at 3500g for 30 min at 4 c the pellet formed upon centrifuge was re suspended in a solution of nacl and centrifuged again bacterial cells were double washed with the electrolyte solution to ensure removal of the medium used for growth the bacterial pellet was then re suspended into a solution of nacl to achieve a final absorbance of 0 12 counts at a wavelength of 600 nm determined with a spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent u s a this absorbance corresponds to an initial bacterial influent concentration of approximately 4 107 cfu ml two types of experiments were run namely i experiments at constant salinity to derive concentration fronts of e coli to be used in the calibration of the model and ii experiments at variable salinity to verify the calibrated model in the constant salinity experiments the column was flooded with a solution containing selected concentrations of nacl resulting in salinity values between 1 and 20 ppt corresponding to ionic strength between 0 02 and 0 31 mol kg initially the brine was injected until the values of conductivity and ph measured in the outlet stream equaled those in the inlet stream once the system reached equilibrium a suspension brine with a concentration of e coli equal to 4 107 cfu ml and salinity equal to that of the initial injected solution was supplied to the column the injection of the brine lasted approximately 175 pv i e pv qt nv where q is the flow rate m3 s t is the time s n is the porosity and v is the total volume of the porous medium within the column m3 the value of 175 pv corresponds to 17 h approximately once the system stabilized under this condition the initial brine was supplied again to the column until the bacteria concentration reached zero the experiments under constant salinity were conducted with sand of average grain size equal to 150 350 and 710 μm in the experiments where salinity was varied the column was initially stabilized with a brine of 1 ppt salinity until the values of conductivity and ph measured at the outlet equaled those in the inlet after the system reached equilibrium a suspension brine with a concentration of e coli equal to 4 107 cfu ml and salinity between 5 and 20 ppt was injected into the column for approximately 175 pv then the initial solution was injected again 3 transport model the mass conservation laws for bacteria and solute transport in porous media for one dimensional 1d single phase flow write herzig et al 1970 matthess and pekdeger 1981 powelson and mills 2001 bradford et al 2003 bradford and bettahar 2006 1 c t ρ n s att t s str t v c x d 2 c x 2 0 2 c s t v c s x d 2 c s x 2 0 where 0 x l is the longitudinal coordinate m with l the length of the domain c is the bacteria concentration given in colony forming unit per unit volume cfu ml c s is the salinity ppt ρ is the bulk density of the porous medium g cm3 s att and s str are the concentrations of microorganisms retained within the porous medium surface cfu g due to attachment detachment and straining respectively which control the bacteria mass transfer at the solid liquid interface bos et al 1999 and the mechanical retention at the pore throat adamczyk et al 1994 johnson and elimelech 1995 the constitutive equations for these processes write respectively as herzig et al 1970 matthess and pekdeger 1981 powelson and mills 2001 bradford et al 2003 bradford and bettahar 2006 3 ρ n s att t k att c ρ n k det s att 4 ρ n s str t k str 1 s str s max c where k att and k det represent correspondingly the attachment and detachment coefficients 1 min k str is the straining coefficient 1 min and s max is the maximum concentration that can be retained by straining in the porous medium cfu g eq 1 through 4 were discretized using an implicit finite difference method backward in space and forward in time and then implemented in matlab matlab 2020 the discretized system of equations was solved iterativelly using the newton raphson method further details about the numerical discretization implementation numerical coupling as well as the verification of the numerics with analytical solution are reported in our earlier work zhang et al 2019 the attachment detachment and straining processes are affected by the type of bacteria aqueous chemistry and the type and size of the granular material bai et al 2016 wang et al 2013 foppen et al 2007 therefore the values of the model parameters namely k att k det k str and s max may change accordingly in this work we estimated the values of the model parameters by inverting the model on the measurements carried out during experiments run at constant salinity in this way mathematical relationships between the estimated parameters and the salinity could be determined at each selected grain size the inversion of the transport model eq 1 through 4 on the measurements was carried out using the matlab function nlinfit matlab 2020 to the best of our knowledge there are only few works where bacteria and solute transport equations have been combined mathematically bradford et al 2015 tosco et al 2009 in order to describe the dynamics of the bacteria concentration under variable chemical conditions these works have a different approach for model calibration and no validation was performed in this work the model was instead calibrated under controlled conditions of grain size and salinity and then verified with experiments under variable salinity 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization and calibration the size of the bacteria was determined with dls measurements the average diameter was 1 42 0 07 μm the values of ζ for the bacteria and the ottawa sand were measured at ph and salinity within the intervals employed in this work the measured values were always negative and varied between 7 and 20 mv for the bacteria and 7 and 35 mv for the sand fig 2 prior to the experiments a calibration curve was built to convert absorbance into concentration since the relationship between optical density 600 nm od600 and biomass concentration is not linear it only approximates to linearity at low od values therefore the calibration was determined by using bacteria concentration with od less than 1 the results are shown in fig 3 4 2 decay rate of bacteria the work by carlucci and pramer carlucci and pramer 1960 reports that in 48 h approximately 90 of the bacteria can decay in seawater salinity 35 ppt therefore we run tests to analyze the decay rate by measuring the bacteria concentration using the epa standard method 1604 usepa 2002 that allows to quantify the alive bacteria fraction the results are reported in fig 4 assuming first order kinetics and the rate constants were determined upon fitting and they correspond to 0 028 0 019 0 045 and 0 059 h 1 for the tests at 1 10 15 and 20 ppt respectively the decay starts to become important around 15 and 20 ppt therefore giving the literature and our calculations we selected 20 ppt as the maximum salinity for our tests 4 3 transport experiments table 1 lists all the conditions applied in the transport experiments specifically the table reports the values of the average particle size of the sand ψ μm the initial and the injected concentration of salt c s ini and c s inj respectively the injected concentration of bacteria c inj cells ml and the ph in the initial solution and in the injected suspension the average flow velocity v m s and the hydrodynamic dispersion d m2 s were estimated with tracer tests prior each injection and their values were equal to respectively 3 10 4 1 2 10 5 m s and 5 10 6 2 2 10 6 m2 s the porosity n of the medium was determined gravimetrically and it was between 0 35 and 0 40 the temperature of the injected and withdrawn fluids were controlled by the a c system of the laboratory room and maintained around 22 c 4 3 1 constant salinity the bacteria and salinity concentrations are reported in fig 5 in conjunction with the model upon optimization here the normalized effluent concentration of e coli is plotted against the number of pvs as it possible to see in fig 5 the larger the salinity the lower the normalized concentration at the outlet this is because as salinity increases the attachment of bacteria onto the porous medium surface is favored torkzaban et al 2008 as well as the aggregation of bacteria that are retained by mechanical straining at the pore throats kim et al 2009 jagmann et al 2015 resulting in a greater retention of e coli within the porous medium at given salinity e g 10 ppt parts g h and f the maximum normalized concentration at the outlet increases from approximately 0 2 to 0 8 0 9 as the sand size increases from 150 to 710 μm this is because as the particle size increases there is a smaller surface area available for attachment and larger permeability of the medium wang et al 2017a causing lower filter capacity of the porous medium all the measurements performed at constant salinity were used to determine the parameter values namely k att k str k det and s max n inj with n inj the bacteria count per unit volume of injected suspension and identify their relationship with the salinity fig 6 shows the estimates the parameters related to attachment and straining i e k att k str and s max n inj increase with salinity and decreasing grain size while those related to detachment i e k det decreases with salinity and with decreasing particle size simple mathematical relationships were formulated to describe the trend of the parameters 5 k att α 1 c s c s α 2 6 k det α 3 c s α 4 7 k str α 5 c s 8 s max n inj α 6 c s 1 α 7 c s where α 1 through α 7 are positive numbers these relationships couple mathematically the transport equation of bacteria eq 1 and salinity eq 2 the r2 calculated upon the fitting of the parameters is between 0 78 and 0 99 the estimated model parameters compare well to those in the literature foppen et al 2007 bai et al 2016 at similar salinity section 4 of the si document except for the attachment coefficient which is much smaller than that in this work this is because attachment is the most sensitive to salinity and becomes negligible as salinity vanishes 4 3 2 variable salinity in this section the experimental results from experiments run at variable salinity table 1 are reported and discussed figs 7 through 9 show the experimental results together with simulations using the calibrated model for each test reported in the figures the top diagram reports the measured bacteria and salinity concentrations in conjunction with model simulation results while the bottom diagram shows the trend of the pressure difference i e δp p i p o where p i and p o are the pressure at the inlet and the outlet respectively and the ph at the outlet in all tests the ph varies within a narrow range i e 5 and 6 fig 7 shows that as the salinity increases from 5 to 15 ppt the normalized concentration c c inj at the outlet decreases and the bacteria concentration front becomes more retarded at salinity equal to 15 ppt c c inj is nearly zero suggesting almost complete retention of the bacteria in the porous medium however despite of the significant bacteria retention the pressure difference is almost constant indicating that attachment and straining do not affect the permeability of the porous medium upon salinity drop two concentration peaks form we believe that they are due to two mechanisms of bacteria mobilization namely a rapid reverse straining process followed by slower detachment overall the bacteria concentration increase due to the injection of low salinity brine reaching values up to 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the injected fluid this observation confirms that a significant amount of bacteria was retained in the porous medium even if the pressure across the column remained almost constant release due to salinity drop can be explained by the trend of the zeta potential of the bacteria and sand as the salinity decreases the zeta potential increases resulting in a greater surface charge that inhibits inter particle attraction due to van der walls forces and therefore less retention of the bacteria in the porous medium shen et al 2018 fig 8 reports the results from tests run with sand of average grain size equal to 350 μm here no retardation in the bacteria concentration fronts can be observed the fronts breakthrough at 1 pv and reach a plateau soon afterwards however the normalized concentration does not reach 1 in all cases because of the slow attachment process that has not reach equilibrium yet for salinity of the injected suspension equal to 15 ppt a concentration peak starts to appear in the measurements as the conditions are reversed the model predicts a peak formation already for the injected suspension equal to 10 ppt this discrepancy could be due to the detection method it is important to point out that the magnitude of the peaks measured and predicted in exp 21 and 22 are much smaller than those in exp 6 and 7 at the same conditions but performed using finer sand finally fig 9 reports the results from tests run with sand of average grain size equal to 710 μm similar observations can be made regarding the effect of salinity on bacteria transport as those made for the tests run using sand of 350 μ m grain size no retardation in the concentration front was recorded and a peak upon salinity reduction was measured and predicted for injected salinity larger than 10 ppt no peak is observed at the lowest injected salinity value due to the negligible concentration of the retained bacteria in the column effluents during the experiments run at the largest salinity were also characterized using the plating method epa standard method 1604 usepa 2002 to verify the decay during the tests during the mobilization it is possible to see in fig 10 the concentrations determined with the two methods agree very well confirming overall the calibrated model predicts well the overall concentration front and to the best of our knowledge this is the first work where bacteria and solute transport equations have been coupled mathematically through the constitutive equations in order to describe the dynamics of the bacteria concentration under variable chemical conditions however in few cases the magnitude of the peak is either under predicted e g part c of fig 7 or over predicted e g part e of fig 8 improvement in the predictions could be made by calibrating the model over a larger dataset the calculated r2 is between 0 6 and 0 85 4 4 total mass of bacteria retained the reversibility of the retention of bacteria inside the column was calculated through mass balance of the measurements and model data the process was not completely reversible as the calculated accumulation varies between 0 and 98 with the largest value calculated for exp 4 where the finest sand and the largest salinity were used moreover using the calibrated model we determined the diagrams of the total mass of bacteria retained into the column and released from the column as a function of grain size and salinity as it possible to see in fig 11 both the retained and the detached mass increase with salinity and they reach a maximum at the smallest particle size retention in fine soil is generally associated to a larger surface area of the particles that favors attachment balkhair 2017 moreover the pore structure may play an important role in the bacteria retention process torkzaban et al 2008 suggested that increasing ionic strength causes larger retention of bacteria due to the increase of attraction forces between bacteria and the surface favoring adhesion at stagnant points within the pores in addition considering a characteristic length of e coli equal to 2 0 μm and an average pore throat size of 5 20 100 μm for 150 350 and 710 μm respectively nelson 2009 straining process is expected to become more important with decreasing size moreover at high salinity bacteria may agglomerate flocculate creating large clusters enhancing even further straining mcgregor and finn 1969 zita and hermansson 1994 4 5 parametric analysis of the model to understand which of the two mechanisms dominate retention under the applied conditions we performed a parametric analysis of the model eq 5 through 8 were multiplied to highlight the change in the behaviour of bacteria upon amplification of one model parameter at the time the results are shown in fig 12 here the parameter functions for the 350 μm size sand were changed one at the time to analyze the influence of a parameter on the bacteria transport behaviour for instance in part a of this figure eq 5 was scaled by a factor of 2 5 and 4 while eq 6 through 8 were maintained same increasing k att the only major effect is the magnitude of the peak upon salinity drop which increases up to almost 4 fold part c of this figure shows the results when changing k str as the parameter value increases the retardation of the normalized concentration decreases and the peak magnitude increases similar analysis was carried out by foppen et al 2007 through t value statistic they observed the t values of the k a were the highest suggesting that the major retention mechanism was attachment in our work contrarily by comparing the effect of parameter change on concentration profile we can notice that straining is the mechanism responsible for the strong retardation and the high peak formation in particular during experiments run using the finest sand and applying the largest salinity drop the change of the other two model parameters does not influence significantly the concentration fronts overall this indicates that attachment and straining are dominant processes under different conditions i e in the presence of coarse and fine sand respectively 5 conclusions this paper presents an experimental and modeling work to understand the effect of variable salinity conditions between 1 and 20 ppt on escherichia coli transport through fine and coarse sand a coupled mathematical model developed earlier in our group was used to describe the transport behaviour under variable salinity conditions a column flood system was built to run experiments using sand of difference grain size the model was calibrated with experiments at constant salinity and validated with tests where salinity was changed the model compares well with the experimental results and shows that salinity increases the retardation of the bacteria concentration front and the larger the drop of salinity the larger the released bacteria concentration this effect becomes more important as the grain size decreases and at the smallest size and at the largest tested salinity value the dominant mechanism of retention appears to be straining which is completely reversed as the salinity is reduced such a behaviour may be common in other bacterial phenotypes with a different extent however this was not investigated in this work this work suggests that mathematical coupling of transport equations for bacteria and salinity helps predict important features of bacteria migration in porous media such as sharp concentration peaks which are critical for the description of microbial contamination where transient salinity conditions may be established author statement dong zhang experiments modeling simulations visualization and

undertaken to investigate the variations of bacterial community and alkane monooxygenase alkb gene abundance in these zones due to water table fluctuations the n alkanes formed a layer immediately above the water table and when this was raised they were carried upwards through the fluctuating zone into the vadose zone water content and n alkanes component c10 c12 are main factors influencing bacterial community variation in the vadose zone while c10 c12 is a key driving factor shaping bacterial community in the fluctuating zone the most abundant bacterial phyla at all three zones were proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria but moisture niche selection determined their relative abundance the intermittent wetting cycle resulted in higher abundance of proteobacteria and lower abundance of actinobacteria in the vadose and fluctuating zones in comparison to the control column with a static water table the abundances of the alkb gene variants were relatively uniform in different zones probably because the bacterial populations harboring alkb gene are habituated to biogenic n alkanes rather than responding to diesel fuel contamination the variation in the bacterial populations with height due to moisture niche selection had very little effect on the alkb gene abundance possibly because numerous species in both phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria carry an alkb gene variant nevertheless the drop in the water table caused a short term spike in alkb gene abundance in the saturated zone which is most likely associated with transport of solutes or colloids from the fluctuating zone to bacteria species in the saturated zone so a fluctuating water table could potentially increase n alkane biodegradation function keywords water table fluctuations moisture n alkane bacterial community alkane monooxygenase gene 1 introduction petroleum is an important chemical raw material that is widely used to generate energy to support the demands of modern living all over the world gkorezis et al 2016 however leaks inevitably occur during production processing transportation storage and usage frequently resulting in contamination of the subsurface environment with petroleum hydrocarbons zhu et al 2017 after petroleum hydrocarbons enter the soil groundwater system they will undergo a series of complex physical chemical and microbiological reaction processes and exhibit composition and concentration changes bauer et al 2008 many factors affect the environmental behavior of petroleum hydrocarbons but water table fluctuations caused by hydrological dynamics such as rainfall infiltration and regional groundwater extraction rühle et al 2015 mossmark et al 2008 will have a significant impact on their migration transformation and redistribution dobson et al 2007 sinke et al 1998 during the water table fluctuations a zone of fluctuating saturation is produced between the continuously unsaturated vadose zone and continuously saturated zone below the lowest water table xia et al 2020a water table fluctuations promote the migration of petroleum hydrocarbons stafford and rixey 2011 change the spatial distribution of soil moisture and its corresponding pore air haberer et al 2015 and to some extent cause changes in microbial community diversity and structure borer et al 2018 the response of different microorganisms within a community depends on their ability to adapt to a changing environment however selection for adaptability tends to produce microbial communities with greater functional diversity and can result in the co existence of species that are seemingly adapted to different ecological niches pett ridge and firestone 2005 there have been many studies of the shifts in microbial communities of aquifers with varying water tables but most have only focused on the fluctuating zone rezanezhad et al 2014 rühle et al 2015 van driezum et al 2018 gupta et al 2020 however the vadose zone fluctuating zone saturated zone form a continuum in the vertical direction and petroleum hydrocarbons dissolved species and colloidal matter can migrate upward and downward within that continuum as the water table fluctuates meanwhile the bacterial community composition must be zone specific due to the differences in the geochemistry that persists between the vadose fluctuating and saturated zones xiu et al 2020 sheng et al 2021 improved understanding of the redistribution of petroleum hydrocarbons and responses of microbial composition and function in different zones may help assess petroleum hydrocarbon natural attenuation and optimize remediation technologies for petroleum leakages microorganisms play many crucial roles in the natural attenuation of petroleum hydrocarbons in an aquifer but adaptation of the microbial community to the prevailing geochemical conditions will determine which degradation pathways are active in which zones of an aquifer ning et al 2018 for n alkanes the main component of petroleum hydrocarbons gkorezis et al 2016 bacterial communities harboring alkane monooxygenase genes alkb can mediate alkane single terminal oxidation which is the most effective pathway of n alkane aerobic biodegradation lee et al 2021b tourova et al 2016 there are a variety of alkb genes that share homologous sequences and encode alkane monooxygenase jurelevicius et al 2013 among them the alk a alk r and alk p genes are three major types of alkb genes which have been identified to degrade different carbon chain lengths of n alkane the alk r and alk p genes are more effective with short and medium chain n alkanes from c7 c20 while the alk a gene is more responsible for medium and long chain n alkanes from c13 c44 wang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 however it is currently not known if the spatial and temporal variations in the microbial community within an aquifer affects the distribution of these three genes and thus the pathway and biodegradation rate in the vadose fluctuating and saturated zones of an aquifer recent developments in molecular technology make it feasible not only to map spatial variations in microbial communities and functional gene abundances but also to track their temporal variations gonzalez et al 2012 for example a recent study of a hydrologically dynamic alpine oligotrophic aquifer showed dramatic seasonal decreases in the diversity of microbial communities between the relatively nutrient rich period following recharge by summer rains and the nutrient poor period follow recharge by snow melt water zhou et al 2012 separately it has been shown that the abundances of alk a alk r and alk p genes in hydrocarbon contaminated soil exhibit diverse changes over time due to different n alkane contamination level liu et al 2018 however tracking temporal variations in microbial communities and functional gene abundances is a recent innovation and little other temporal data has been published on n alkane contaminated vadose zone fluctuating zone saturated zone continua temporal variations of microbial community structure and alk a alk r and alk p gene abundances in different zones of an aquifer is still very poorly understood so the functional roles within and the ecosystem services provided by a microbial population cannot be identified and thus the impacts from changing groundwater resource use cannot be predicted griebler et al 2014 in the present study the main component of petroleum hydrocarbons n alkane was chosen as the targeted contaminant the variation of environmental characteristics n alkane bacterial community and alkb gene abundance in a simulated vadose zone fluctuating zone saturated zone continuum subjected to seasonal water table fluctuations were determined the spatial patterns of correlation between environmental characteristics n alkane and bacterial communities were analyzed and then the driving factors of shaping bacterial community composition were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design two nominally identical pilot scale aquifer columns were established in the water sciences laboratory at beijing normal university ambient temperature typically 28 0 5 c the columns consist of cylindrical acrylic vessels with a length of 120 cm and an internal diameter of 24 cm see fig 1a the outer wall of each column was wrapped in black cloth to avoid any light entry each column had three lateral ports at depths of 90 cm 60 cm and 30 cm above the base for dissolved oxygen sensors the sensors were inserted into the column through a teflon lined septum nut a 0 2 mm stainless mesh screen was laid on the bottom of each column to prevent clogging the columns were filled with fine grained natural river sand that was collected for this study from a river floodplain near cihe shijiazhuang china the columns were filled to a height of 110 cm using a wet packing procedure to ensure no entrapment of air bubbles xia et al 2020a a 4 cm layer of coarse grained natural river sand also collected from cihe was placed over the fine river sand leaving 6 cm of open headspace at the top of the column the upper surface of the coarse river sand surface was exposed to air to replicate natural conditions the ends of 16 capillary tubes connected to a single manifold were inserted in the coarse river sand distributed evenly over the cross section so that simulated rainfall could be introduced at the top of the column the pretreatment of the river sand is described in the supplementary material and the initial n alkane composition of the fine river sand are reported in the fig s1 after packing the column was drained of water through the bottom drainage port the dry density was 1 60 g cm 3 and the effective porosity was 0 35 o2 depleted tap water before use the tap water was allowed to stand in an open container for several days to release any free chlorine in the water before it was sparged with n2 gas was then injected from the bottom using a peristaltic pump until the water table reached a position 40 cm above the base of the columns the water table in both columns was then held static for 10 days after 10 days 90 ml diesel oil obtained from a gas station china petroleum was injected into each column at the water table through three viton tubes buried in the columns 30 ml through each tube to simulate subsurface leakage if this oil had completely saturated the sand it would have formed a layer approximately 5 mm thick immediately above the water table the water table in both columns was then maintained for 10 days the water table was then slowly varied following a pattern representative of rainfall infiltration followed by regional extraction the ri column while the water table in the other column was held static for the entire experiment the st column in the first stage of the ri experiment two episodes of rainfall infiltration were simulated the water table was raised by 20 cm to 60 cm above the base over a period of 50 h by injecting tap water into the top of the column using a peristaltic pump the simulated rainfall was not de aired at a flow rate of 1 06 ml min 1 see the supplementary material then held static for 16 days and then raised to 80 cm above the base over a second 50 h period in the second stage the water table was held static for 50 days in the third stage representing the impact of regional extraction the water table was lowered to 60 cm above the base over a period of 50 h by pumping groundwater out of the bottom of the column at a flow rate of 1 06 ml min 1 held static for 16 days and then lowered to 40 cm above the base at the same flow rate finally the water table was held static for 10 days the intended pattern of the water table during the first 120 days in the ri experiment can be seen from fig 1b it has similar characteristics to the variations that occur in most agricultural regions of china in response to seasonal rainfall and irrigation finally the water table was held static for an extended period of 90 days to examine whether changes in the bacterial community that resulted from the seasonal water table fluctuations persisted in the long term the process of water table fluctuations created three vertically separated zones within the ri column a continuously saturated zone from 0 to 40 cm above the base a zone of fluctuating saturation from 40 to 80 cm and a continuously unsaturated vadose zone from 80 to 110 cm 2 2 in situ monitoring and sand sampling the volumetric water contents in the vadose and fluctuating zones were monitored by tdr315l probes acclima usa that were embedded vertically at depths of about 80 100 cm and 50 70 cm above the base which were connected to a data logger cr300 campbell usa the dissolved oxygen in the vadose fluctuating and saturated zones were monitored by dp pst3 probes presens germany that were installed at depths of 90 cm 60 cm and 30 cm above the base which were connected to an oxy 10 trace sma meter presens germany sand samples from depths of 89 91 cm 59 61 cm and 29 31 cm above the base were collected after 20 40 90 110 120 and 210 days time points 1 6 using a 120 cm long 1 25 cm diameter direct push manual sampler ams usa further experimental details can be found in the supplementary material these samples were from the vadose zone v fluctuating zone f and saturated zone s respectively the sand samples were stored at 20 c for n alkane and biological analyses jurelevicius et al 2012 chen et al 2018 patil et al 2022 2 3 n alkane analysis the protocol for n alkane extraction and purification from the sand was based on previous studies liu et al 2018 after freeze drying approximately 1 0 g of sand sample was spiked with 0 5 ml 1 chlorooctadecane 0 0018 mg l 1 as a surrogate standard then extracted with 10 ml hexane using ultrasound at 80 khz for 40 min the supernatant was fractionalized by chromatographic column details in the supplementary material the fractions containing n alkane were reduced to less than 2 ml using rotary evaporation transferred to a 2 ml vial evaporated using nitrogen gas flow and then re dissolved in 1 ml hexane with phenanthrene 0 0004 mg l 1 as an internal standard the n alkanes were analyzed using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 6890 gas chromatograph with a 5975c mass selective detector agilent usa the gc was equipped with a capillary column j w hp 5 j w scientific inc usa more details can be found in the supplementary material 2 4 biological analysis total dna was extracted using powersoil dna kits mobio usa in accordance with the manufacturer s instruction the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using the 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 primers details in the supplementary material xia et al 2020b the purified amplicons were subjected to sequencing on an illumina miseq pe300 sequencer illumina usa at allwegene technology co ltd beijing china using standard protocols raw sequence reads were processed using the qiime version 1 2 1 see the supplementary material processed reads were assigned to operational defined taxonomic units otus using usearch version 10 edgar 2017 where otus were defined by minimum of 97 sequence identity between the putative otu members otus containing only one read singletons were not included in downstream analysis other otus were used to annotate the taxonomic information using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier version 2 2 wang et al 2007 against the silva128 16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 70 zhang et al 2020 mothur version 1 34 4 xi et al 2019 was used to conduct the alpha diversity analysis including rarefaction good s coverage observed species chao 1 and shannon index quantitative pcr qpcr was used on triplicate sub samples of each sand sample to measure the abundances of three alkb genes alk a alk r and alk p using 2 x taq mastermix cwbio china three separate primer pairs were used for each gene targeted see table s3 in the supplementary material kuhn et al 2009 marchant et al 2006 wang et al 2016 each reaction mixture contained 10 μl of sybr premix ex taq ii tli rnaseh plus roxplus takara china 0 5 μl each of the forward and reverse primers for the target gene table s3 2 μl of template dna and

transformed for the rda 3 results 3 1 environmental characteristics 3 1 1 water content in the st column the volumetric water content at 50 cm above the water table the vadose zone gradually increased from 4 7 to 8 0 over the experiment fig 2 at the same location in the ri column the initial volumetric water content was similar to that in the st column but it increased rapidly each time the water table was raised to a maximum value of 34 8 on day 42 2 days after the water table reached its maximum but it then decreased while the water table was maintained at its highest level to a value of 27 2 when water table was lowered to its original level there was an 8 10 day lag in the response of volumetric water content in the vadose zone to each of the two decrements but it was 13 4 10 days after the water table was returned to its baseline level and then gradually decreased to 12 2 by the end of the experiment the volumetric water content at 20 cm above the baseline water table in the st column the mid point of the fluctuating zone in the ri column gradually decreased from 33 5 to 13 5 over the course of the experiment at the same location in the ri column the volumetric water content was initially 31 0 but decreased over the first 20 days while the water table was static to 24 2 introduction of the oil had only a small effect on this trend the volumetric water content then increased as the water table was raised to 28 5 when the water table was approximately at the level of the probe and 33 9 when the water table reached its highest level 20 cm above the probe the volumetric water content exhibited only minor variations when the water table was static at its highest level when water table in the ri column was lowered the response at the mid height in the fluctuating zone to the first decrement was very small it decreased to 32 7 and this response lagged 10 days behind the change in the water table there was a larger response to the second decrement with the volumetric water content decreasing rapidly to 25 0 after a lag of 10 days before gradually decreasing further to 17 1 by the end of the experiment 3 1 2 dissolved oxygen the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the vadose zone exhibited essentially the same response in the ri experiment and the st control with the initial value of about 8 7 mg l 1 close to equilibrium with atmosphere gradually decreasing over the course of the experiments to about 7 1 mg l 1 fig 3 at the mid point of the fluctuating zone 20 cm above the baseline water table the do concentration in the st column exhibited essentially the same response as in the vadose zone it decreased gradually from an initial value of 8 4 mg l 1 to 7 0 mg l 1 at the end of the experiment in contrast the do concentration in the ri column initially 8 6 mg l 1 remained similar to that value in the vadose zone only for the first 50 days the water table was raised to its highest level on day 40 but it then decayed to 0 mg l 1 over the next 20 days and maintained that value until about day 100 the water table was lowered to roughly the sensor level on day 92 the do concentration in the fluctuating zone of the ri column then gradually increased to a value of 7 5 mg l 1 over a period of 20 day and remained relatively steady at that value for the remaining 90 days of the experiments fig 3 the do concentration at 10 cm below the baseline water table the saturated zone exhibited essentially the same response in the st and ri columns with the initial value of 3 6 mg l 1 gradually decreasing to 0 mg l 1 over a period of 20 day and the do concentrations in the saturated zones of the columns did not increase again during the experiments fig 3 3 2 n alkane composition and concentration the total n alkane concentration in the ri column and st control varied with the sampling location relative the baseline water table see fig 4 which also shows the distribution of n alkanes by alkane chain length the total n alkane concentration in the st control varied principally with position relative to the water table the time averaged total n alkane concentration in the saturated zone 10 cm below the static water table was 12 0 mg kg 1 whereas it was 7 1 mg kg 1 at 20 cm above and 2 9 mg kg 1 at 50 cm above the static water table whilst these values which are the average from six time points show a consistent trend it is noted that they are similar in magnitude to the background total n alkane concentration in the aquifer sand 8 5 mg kg 1 see fig s1 so the difference may simply reflect natural variability in the sand in the ri column the time averaged total n alkane concentration in the fluctuating and vadose zones 10 9 mg kg 1 and 13 1 mg kg 1 respectively were both generally higher than those in the equivalent zones of the st control whereas in the saturated zone it was similar to the st control 9 7 mg kg 1 also the total n alkane concentrations in the ri column exhibited a temporal pattern that can be attributed to the change in the water table when the water table was raised the total n alkane concentration in the saturated and fluctuating zones progressively decreased from 19 7 mg kg 1 and 24 5 mg kg 1 to 3 0 mg kg 1 and 4 0 mg kg 1 respectively while the total n alkane concentration in the vadose zone increased from 9 4 mg kg 1 to 28 2 mg kg 1 however the pattern in the total n alkane concentrations in the ri column was less clear after the water table was lowered again but total n alkane concentration in the saturated fluctuating and vadose zones were all relatively low by the end of the experiment 3 6 mg kg 1 2 2 mg kg 1 and 2 6 mg kg 1 respectively 3 3 bacterial community diversity and structure the alpha diversity analysis indicates that the sequencing depth was sufficient to characterize the variations in the bacterial populations fig s2 and table s4 the good s coverage index 0 96 for all populations both measures of otu richness observed species and chao 1 index indicate that average otu richness over the duration of the experiments was slightly higher in the ri column than in the st control at all three locations table s4 however this difference may represent replicate variation between the columns as it is present in the first time point before the water table history differed and does not increase over time at phylum level the bacterial populations of the saturated and vadose zones of the st column exhibited only small variations with time in samples from the saturated zone about 40 of sequence reads were assigned to the bacterial phylum proteobacteria nearly a quarter were assigned to firmicutes and about 15 were assigned to actinobacteria fig 5 whereas in samples from the vadose zone 20 of sequence reads were assigned to the bacterial phylum proteobacteria 15 were assigned to firmicutes and nearly half were assigned to actinobacteria there was more variation between the samples taken from 20 cm above the water table in the st column the equivalent zone to fluctuating zone in the ri column but proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria were in all cases the three most abundant phyla the bacterial populations of the saturated zone of the ri column were broadly similar at phylum level to those in the saturated zone of the st column i e proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria were the three most abundant phyla however the proportion of the population assigned to the phylum proteobacteria increased to 60 immediately after simulated rainfall raised the water table and despite decreasing back to 40 with time and remaining at that level while the water table was lowered the proportion of the population assigned to proteobacteria increased to 50 in the long term after the simulated rainfall raised the water table the bacterial populations of the vadose zone of the ri column differed markedly even at phylum level from those of the vadose zone of the st column and were actually more comparable with the bacterial populations of samples taken from 20 cm above the water table in the st column over this period a third of sequences were assigned to proteobacteria and 20 were assigned to each of firmicutes and actinobacteria the proportion that were proteobacteria was highest immediately after the simulated rain event perhaps surprisingly the bacterial populations of the fluctuating zone of the ri column remained fairly constant with time despite the period of saturation during the experiment with about a third of sequences assigned to the phylum proteobacteria 20 assigned to actinobacteria and 15 assigned to firmicutes 3 4 alkane monooxygenase gene abundance in both the ri and st columns the abundance of the three alkb gene variants generally decreased in the order alk p alk r alk a fig 6 interestingly while there were only small variations in the abundance of these genes between the triplicate measurements from the same location suggesting good analytical repeatability there were considerable temporal variations in the abundance of each gene at each location however despite this temporal variability there are some patterns to gene abundance the abundance of the alk p gene generally decreased between sample locations in the order st vadose zone ri vadose zone st fluctuating zone equivalent zone of ri fluctuating zone ri fluctuating zone the saturated zones thus the time averaged abundance of the alk p gene was roughly correlated with the distance of the sample location from the water table although the differences in the time averaged abundance of the alk p gene in the st column were small the notable exception to this pattern was a very high abundance of the alk p gene in the saturated zone of the ri column immediately after the water table had been lowered the time averaged abundance of the alk r gene exhibited a similar pattern with sample locations and again showed a high abundance in the saturated zone of the ri column only for the single time point immediately after the water table had been lowered the abundance of the alk a gene was generally about two orders of magnitude lower than the alk p gene and it was generally slightly higher in saturated zone than the vadose and fluctuating zones especially at the time point immediately after the water table had been lowered 3 5 relationship among environmental characteristics n alkane bacterial communities and alkane monooxygenase genes rda analysis was performed to identify the factors driving temporal variations in bacterial community structure in different zones fig 7 for the vadose zone the first and second rda axes explained 52 and 19 of the variance respectively the water content had the largest significant effect on the bacterial community p 0 001 explaining 38 of the community variation table s5 the c10 c12 concentration had the second largest significant effect on community variation p 0 038 moreover multiple correlation analysis indicates that the total n alkane c10 c12 c17 c20 and c21 c25 concentrations have a significant positive correlation with water content table s6 the relative abundance of proteobacteria has a significant positive correlation with water content whereas the actinobacteria has a significant negative correlation with water content for the fluctuating zone the first two axes explained 49 of the variance and the c10 c12 concentration explained 22 of the community variation p 0 022 for the saturated zone the first two axes together explained 55 of the variance the c21 c25 concentration explained 20 of the community variation but with a lower degree of significance p 0 053 multiple correlation analysis also indicates the relationship between the alkb genes and dominant phyla but these are either localized to only one aquifer zone or suggest a correlation between an alkb gene variant and a bacterial phylum that does not contain genera reported to contain the gene table s7 so these correlations are unlikely to indicate causality 4 discussion 4 1 effects of water table fluctuations on environmental characteristics once the static water table was established there were only minor relatively slow changes in the geochemical conditions within the st column there was a very small gradual increase in the volumetric water content at 50 cm vadose zone and a decrease at 20 cm above the water table the fluctuating zone as a steady state pattern of decreasing volumetric water content with height above the water table was established in the absence of rainfall infiltration hou et al 2019 the do concentrations in both these unsaturated zones had a slight downward gradient but were at values close to equilibrium with atmospheric o2 at the laboratory temperature patel and vashi 2015 in contrast the do concentration in the saturated zone decreased steadily from the start of the experiment reaching zero shortly after time point 1 when the water table was raised in the ri column with the injection of the diesel fuel having little impact on the rate of decrease thus the influx of oxygen to the saturated zone was less than the rate of consumption and the saturated zone was essential anoxic xia et al 2020a importantly from time point 1 the geochemical conditions were essential steady in the st column in contrast the geochemical conditions in the vadose and fluctuating zones of the ri column varied with the water table after simulated rainfall saturation in the vadose zone peaked at about 80 shortly after the water table reached its highest level but dropped quickly to about 70 despite this high degree of saturation the do concentration was indistinguishable from that in the equivalent zone of the st column i e it was close to equilibrium with atmospheric o2 saturation decreased again as the water table was lowered and it was only slightly higher than that in the st column at the end of the experiment saturation in the fluctuating zone of the ri column also reached 80 saturation shortly after the water table reached its highest level but remained at that level whilst the water table was high and after a short delay the do concentration decreased to below the detection limit this suggests that the remaining pore air in the fluctuating zone is trapped in discrete bubbles which can persist for significant periods of time in shallow groundwater mcleod et al 2015 and as a result the do consumption by microbial respiration exceeded the rate of diffusion from above robinson 2019 højberg and sørensen 1993 there was less change in the geochemical conditions in the ri column below the initial water table the do concentration remained below the detection limit from shortly after time point 1 despite the translation of the simulated rainwater into this zone from the fluctuating zone when the water table was lowered 4 2 redistributions of n alkane caused by water table fluctuations diesel is a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl so it will have formed a 5 mm thick layer just above the water table it is also a non wetting liquid so negligible capillary rise would be expected and n alkanes c10 and above have negligible solubility in water therefore the modest concentrations of n alkanes in the fluctuating and vadose zones of the st column are probably mainly biogenic in origin produced by plants and associated with the soil organic matter this assumption is supported by the majority being longer n alkanes c17 c25 longer chain length n alkanes are waxes at or below room temperature nist 2021 and can cause diesel fuel to gel at lower temperatures whereas typically 90 of the n alkanes in diesel fuel are c10 c17 liang et al 2005 thus the time averaged n alkane concentrations in these zones of the st column which are very similar to the n alkane concentration in the fine river sand fig s1 represent the typical background levels in the columns in the saturated zone of the ri column the time averaged total n alkane concentration was similar to that in the saturated zone of the st column however the time averaged total n alkane concentration in the vadose and fluctuating zones were higher than those in the equivalent zones of the st column moreover when the water table was raised the total n alkane concentration in the ri column decreased in the saturated zone but increased in the fluctuating and vadose zones various n alkane components were significantly and positively correlated with water content in the vadose zone this suggests that the increase in water content led to increase of n alkane concentration under water table fluctuation previous studies kechavarzi et al 2005 have also shown that the n alkanes migrate upwards when the water table rises this is because diesel is a non polar liquid so mineral surfaces were strongly water wetted water will have readily displaces diesel from surfaces and so the diesel layer will have risen with the water table although a residual amount may have remained trapped in fine pores or associated with organic matter powers et al 1996 4 3 variations in bacterial community during water table fluctuations the bacterial communities in the st column exhibited only small variations with time but there is a progressive change in bacterial community with increasing height due to the decreasing availability of water and possibly the increasing availability of oxygen at all three locations the three most abundant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes however the proteobacteria which were dominant in the saturated zone were less abundant in the vadose zone 40 and 20 relative abundance respectively whereas actinobacteria which were third most abundant in the saturated zone were dominant in the vadose zone 15 and 50 relative abundance respectively there was also a slight trend of decreasing firmicutes relative abundance with height 25 in the saturated zone and 15 in the vadose zone at phylum level the bacterial populations in the fluctuating zone were more like those in the saturated zone than those in the vadose zone suggesting that the availability of water has a bigger impact on the populations than the availability of oxygen the do concentration in both the vadose and fluctuating zones were close to equilibrium with atmosphere whereas the saturated zone was anoxic similar moisture niche selection among these common soil phyla with actinobacteria more abundant at low and proteobacteria more abundant at high moisture values has been observed in fine sandy loam from a semi arid site evans et al 2014 bacterial communities dominated by proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes are found at other petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated soils gao et al 2014 lu et al 2014 liu et al 2020 and these populations have been identified as the dominant bacterial phyla with the capability of hydrocarbon metabolism smith et al 2015 shahi et al 2016 yang et al 2014 at phylum level the bacterial community in the saturated zone of the ri column was like that in the saturated zone of the st column when averaged over the experiment the relative abundance of the proteobacteria 45 was slightly higher and the firmicutes 15 was slightly lower than in the st column but the relative abundance of the actinobacteria was 15 in the saturated zone of both columns the modest differences in time averaged communities between the saturated zones were associated with temporal changes in the population of the ri column associated with movement of the water table there was an increase in the relative abundance of the proteobacteria and a decrease in the relative abundance of the firmicutes both at the end of the period when simulated rainfall raised the water table and 10 days after simulated regional extraction lowered the water table it is initially surprising that both raising and lowering the water table resulted in similar shifts in the bacterial populations but the causal process may be the same as rainfall infiltration results in downward percolation of water through unsaturated soil and contaminated capillary fringe to the edge of the saturated zone whereas drawdown carries accumulated rainwater from the fluctuating zone to the saturated zone these two processes delivered water bodies with similar geochemistry to the saturated zone most probably by introducing oxygen into the saturated zone due to the infiltration of oxygen containing rainwater and entrapment of oxygen from the fluctuating zone as the water table was decreased at phylum level the bacterial communities in the fluctuating and vadose zones of the ri column were obviously different from those in the st column water content was identified as the key factor shaping temporal variations in bacterial community in the vadose zone and c10 c12 was the driving factor of bacterial community in both the vadose and fluctuating zones moreover they were like that in the saturated zone although there is a decrease in the average relative abundance of the proteobacteria with height within the column 35 and 30 in the fluctuating and vadose zones respectively and a very small increase in the relative abundance of the actinobacteria 20 in both the fluctuating and vadose zones thus the higher average water content at both locations due to the variation in the water table moderated the moisture niche selective pressure that favoured proteobacteria species evans et al 2014 also the general similarity of the bacterial populations in the three zones may be an indication that fluctuations in the water table reduce the hydrological and geochemical differences between saturated fluctuating and vadose zones and smears the hydrocarbons between the zones leading to less difference in bacterial habitats provided hamamura et al 2013 4 4 variations in abundance of alkane monooxygenase gene during water table fluctuations bacterial degradation of n alkanes can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions but is much faster under aerobic conditions widdel and rabus 2001 kloos et al 2006 the alkane monooxygenase a rubredoxin dependent enzyme kloos et al 2006 has been shown to be a key enzyme in the degradation of n alkanes in aerobic systems jurelevicius et al 2013 mckenna and coon 1970 three variants of the alkb gene that encodes the enzyme alkane monooxygenase were tracked in the column experiments these variants have been identified in the genome of hundreds of different bacterial species primarily from phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and spirochaetes jurelevicius et al 2013 yakimov et al 2004 wentzel et al 2007 kim et al 2021 nie et al 2014 in each zone of both the st and ri columns the abundance of three variants decreased in the order alk p alk r alk a in just one of the 36 samples alk a was slightly more abundant than alk r and overall alk p was 1000 more abundant than alk a in the st column the time averaged gene abundances show only modest differences with height in the column further there is no clear temporal pattern in the gene abundances in the fluctuating and vadose zones of this column given that soil organic matter usually contains low levels of n alkanes from plants these are probably the background abundances of the alkb gene variants in the bacterial populations of the soil however the abundance of all three gene variants exhibited a similar temporal pattern in the saturated zone of the st column first there was an increase in gene variant abundance between time points 1 and 2 then a decrease until time point 4 and only minor variations thereafter the initial increase in gene abundance may have been a response to the introduction of the diesel while the pore water still contained low levels of dissolved oxygen followed by a decrease in gene abundances once the system was fully anoxic thapa 2012 in the vadose zone of the ri column the time averaged abundances of all three gene variants were similar to the mean value in the st column whereas in the fluctuating zone they were slightly lower in the saturated zone of the ri column the time averaged abundances of all three gene variants were an order of magnitude higher than the mean value in the st column however this difference is associated with a 100 increase in the abundance of all three gene variants when the water table was lowered from its highest position time point 4 which was then not sustained once the water table was stable in its lower position if time point 4 is ignored the time averaged abundances of all three gene variants in the saturated zone of the ri column were similar to the mean value in the st column thus without spike when the water table was lowered the time averaged abundances of all three gene variants were very similar in the equivalent zones of the ri and st columns the increase in alkb gene variants in the saturated zone when the water table was lowered is most likely associated with transport of solutes or colloids from the fluctuating zone to bacteria species in saturated zone but it is unclear what that species might be trace dissolved oxygen dissolved organic matter nutrients etc however rapid changes in the bacterial community in the saturated zone due to infiltration of geochemically different water has been observed in other systems fillinger et al 2021 4 5 implications of the alkane monooxygenase gene distribution while elevated alkane concentrations in the subsurface environment are usually the result of contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons rojo 2009 alkanes are also produced by many living organisms such as plants and cyanobacteria and form part of the biomass in soil bush and mcinerney 2013 blumer et al 1971 schirmer et al 2010 kloos et al 2006 as a result alkanes are present at low concentrations in most soil and water environments brassell et al 1978 lee et al 2021a this is why alkane degrading microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature wentzel et al 2007 it is also why the abundance of the alkb gene variants was relatively uniform in the columns reported here with the exception of the ri column after the water table was lowered this suggests that the introduction of the diesel fuel into the columns generally had very little effect on the alkb gene abundance probably because the bacterial populations harboring alkb gene were habituated to biogenic alkanes associated with the soil organic matter and the abundances of bacteria carrying this gene were limited by factors other than the n alkane concentration more surprisingly the variation in the bacterial populations with height due to moisture niche selection with actinobacteria more abundant at low and proteobacteria more abundant at high moisture values also had very little effect on the alkb gene abundance possibly because numerous species in both phyla carry one or other alkb gene variant table s7 and references therein whilst there was little spatial variation in the abundance of the alkb gene variants despite differences in the bacterial populations with height in the column suggesting that moisture niche selection does not affect the alkb gene abundance there was a dramatic 100 increase in the abundance of all three alkb gene variants in the saturated zone of the ri column after the water table was lowered this was not directly associated with transfer of bacteria from a zone where the alkb gene abundance was high alkb gene abundance was not higher in the fluctuating zone or with an increase the n alkane concentration so it is inferred that it associated with some other factor affecting the growth of bacteria carrying the alkb gene this may be associated with the transport of a limiting factor to the saturated zone trace dissolved oxygen organic matter nutrients etc or equally may have been the result of mixing due to the water flow n alkanes are largely insoluble but reaction with a cell surface associated oxygenase requires cell contact wentzel et al 2007 so flow induced mixing may be an important factor whatever the cause it clearly demonstrates that a varying water table can significantly impact on the genetic potential to degrade n alkane in a system representative of a shallow unconfined aquifer 5 conclusions this study proposed that the vadose zone fluctuating zone saturated zone in a soil column must be considered as a continuum it reports the spatio temporal distribution of bacterial community and alkb gene abundance in a simulated diesel fuel lnapl contaminated aquifer during water table fluctuations alkb is an important gene for bacterial degradation of n alkanes the main component of diesel fuel it found by rda analysis that water content and n alkanes c10 c12 were the driver of temporal distribution of community structure in the vadose zone and c10 c12 was the driver of temporal distribution of community structure in the fluctuating zones meanwhile the community structure in the saturated zone shared a similar temporal trend with that in the static condition we found that moisture niches selection accounted for the vertical distribution of community structure in subsurface with relative abundance of proteobacteria increasing and actinobacteria decreasing with water content but seasonal water table fluctuations led to less difference between different zones in the continuum the abundances of the alkb gene variants were relatively uniform in different zones however variation in the water table caused a short term spike in alkb gene abundance in the saturated zone after the water table was lowered suggesting a fluctuating water table could increase functional potential to degrade n alkane in the shallow

1302,n alkanes the main component of diesel fuel are common light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls that threaten ecological security the subsurface from vadose zone through fluctuating zone to saturated zone is a critical multi interface earth layer which significantly affects the biodegradation processes of n alkanes a pilot scale diesel contaminated aquifer column experiment has been undertaken to investigate the variations of bacterial community and alkane monooxygenase alkb gene abundance in these zones due to water table fluctuations the n alkanes formed a layer immediately above the water table and when this was raised they were carried upwards through the fluctuating zone into the vadose zone water content and n alkanes component c10 c12 are main factors influencing bacterial community variation in the vadose zone while c10 c12 is a key driving factor shaping bacterial community in the fluctuating zone the most abundant bacterial phyla at all three zones were proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria but moisture niche selection determined their relative abundance the intermittent wetting cycle resulted in higher abundance of proteobacteria and lower abundance of actinobacteria in the vadose and fluctuating zones in comparison to the control column with a static water table the abundances of the alkb gene variants were relatively uniform in different zones probably because the bacterial populations harboring alkb gene are habituated to biogenic n alkanes rather than responding to diesel fuel contamination the variation in the bacterial populations with height due to moisture niche selection had very little effect on the alkb gene abundance possibly because numerous species in both phyla proteobacteria and actinobacteria carry an alkb gene variant nevertheless the drop in the water table caused a short term spike in alkb gene abundance in the saturated zone which is most likely associated with transport of solutes or colloids from the fluctuating zone to bacteria species in the saturated zone so a fluctuating water table could potentially increase n alkane biodegradation function keywords water table fluctuations moisture n alkane bacterial community alkane monooxygenase gene 1 introduction petroleum is an important chemical raw material that is widely used to generate energy to support the demands of modern living all over the world gkorezis et al 2016 however leaks inevitably occur during production processing transportation storage and usage frequently resulting in contamination of the subsurface environment with petroleum hydrocarbons zhu et al 2017 after petroleum hydrocarbons enter the soil groundwater system they will undergo a series of complex physical chemical and microbiological reaction processes and exhibit composition and concentration changes bauer et al 2008 many factors affect the environmental behavior of petroleum hydrocarbons but water table fluctuations caused by hydrological dynamics such as rainfall infiltration and regional groundwater extraction rühle et al 2015 mossmark et al 2008 will have a significant impact on their migration transformation and redistribution dobson et al 2007 sinke et al 1998 during the water table fluctuations a zone of fluctuating saturation is produced between the continuously unsaturated vadose zone and continuously saturated zone below the lowest water table xia et al 2020a water table fluctuations promote the migration of petroleum hydrocarbons stafford and rixey 2011 change the spatial distribution of soil moisture and its corresponding pore air haberer et al 2015 and to some extent cause changes in microbial community diversity and structure borer et al 2018 the response of different microorganisms within a community depends on their ability to adapt to a changing environment however selection for adaptability tends to produce microbial communities with greater functional diversity and can result in the co existence of species that are seemingly adapted to different ecological niches pett ridge and firestone 2005 there have been many studies of the shifts in microbial communities of aquifers with varying water tables but most have only focused on the fluctuating zone rezanezhad et al 2014 rühle et al 2015 van driezum et al 2018 gupta et al 2020 however the vadose zone fluctuating zone saturated zone form a continuum in the vertical direction and petroleum hydrocarbons dissolved species and colloidal matter can migrate upward and downward within that continuum as the water table fluctuates meanwhile the bacterial community composition must be zone specific due to the differences in the geochemistry that persists between the vadose fluctuating and saturated zones xiu et al 2020 sheng et al 2021 improved understanding of the redistribution of petroleum hydrocarbons and responses of microbial composition and function in different zones may help assess petroleum hydrocarbon natural attenuation and optimize remediation technologies for petroleum leakages microorganisms play many crucial roles in the natural attenuation of petroleum hydrocarbons in an aquifer but adaptation of the microbial community to the prevailing geochemical conditions will determine which degradation pathways are active in which zones of an aquifer ning et al 2018 for n alkanes the main component of petroleum hydrocarbons gkorezis et al 2016 bacterial communities harboring alkane monooxygenase genes alkb can mediate alkane single terminal oxidation which is the most effective pathway of n alkane aerobic biodegradation lee et al 2021b tourova et al 2016 there are a variety of alkb genes that share homologous sequences and encode alkane monooxygenase jurelevicius et al 2013 among them the alk a alk r and alk p genes are three major types of alkb genes which have been identified to degrade different carbon chain lengths of n alkane the alk r and alk p genes are more effective with short and medium chain n alkanes from c7 c20 while the alk a gene is more responsible for medium and long chain n alkanes from c13 c44 wang et al 2016 liu et al 2018 however it is currently not known if the spatial and temporal variations in the microbial community within an aquifer affects the distribution of these three genes and thus the pathway and biodegradation rate in the vadose fluctuating and saturated zones of an aquifer recent developments in molecular technology make it feasible not only to map spatial variations in microbial communities and functional gene abundances but also to track their temporal variations gonzalez et al 2012 for example a recent study of a hydrologically dynamic alpine oligotrophic aquifer showed dramatic seasonal decreases in the diversity of microbial communities between the relatively nutrient rich period following recharge by summer rains and the nutrient poor period follow recharge by snow melt water zhou et al 2012 separately it has been shown that the abundances of alk a alk r and alk p genes in hydrocarbon contaminated soil exhibit diverse changes over time due to different n alkane contamination level liu et al 2018 however tracking temporal variations in microbial communities and functional gene abundances is a recent innovation and little other temporal data has been published on n alkane contaminated vadose zone fluctuating zone saturated zone continua temporal variations of microbial community structure and alk a alk r and alk p gene abundances in different zones of an aquifer is still very poorly understood so the functional roles within and the ecosystem services provided by a microbial population cannot be identified and thus the impacts from changing groundwater resource use cannot be predicted griebler et al 2014 in the present study the main component of petroleum hydrocarbons n alkane was chosen as the targeted contaminant the variation of environmental characteristics n alkane bacterial community and alkb gene abundance in a simulated vadose zone fluctuating zone saturated zone continuum subjected to seasonal water table fluctuations were determined the spatial patterns of correlation between environmental characteristics n alkane and bacterial communities were analyzed and then the driving factors of shaping bacterial community composition were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design two nominally identical pilot scale aquifer columns were established in the water sciences laboratory at beijing normal university ambient temperature typically 28 0 5 c the columns consist of cylindrical acrylic vessels with a length of 120 cm and an internal diameter of 24 cm see fig 1a the outer wall of each column was wrapped in black cloth to avoid any light entry each column had three lateral ports at depths of 90 cm 60 cm and 30 cm above the base for dissolved oxygen sensors the sensors were inserted into the column through a teflon lined septum nut a 0 2 mm stainless mesh screen was laid on the bottom of each column to prevent clogging the columns were filled with fine grained natural river sand that was collected for this study from a river floodplain near cihe shijiazhuang china the columns were filled to a height of 110 cm using a wet packing procedure to ensure no entrapment of air bubbles xia et al 2020a a 4 cm layer of coarse grained natural river sand also collected from cihe was placed over the fine river sand leaving 6 cm of open headspace at the top of the column the upper surface of the coarse river sand surface was exposed to air to replicate natural conditions the ends of 16 capillary tubes connected to a single manifold were inserted in the coarse river sand distributed evenly over the cross section so that simulated rainfall could be introduced at the top of the column the pretreatment of the river sand is described in the supplementary material and the initial n alkane composition of the fine river sand are reported in the fig s1 after packing the column was drained of water through the bottom drainage port the dry density was 1 60 g cm 3 and the effective porosity was 0 35 o2 depleted tap water before use the tap water was allowed to stand in an open container for several days to release any free chlorine in the water before it was sparged with n2 gas was then injected from the bottom using a peristaltic pump until the water table reached a position 40 cm above the base of the columns the water table in both columns was then held static for 10 days after 10 days 90 ml diesel oil obtained from a gas station china petroleum was injected into each column at the water table through three viton tubes buried in the columns 30 ml through each tube to simulate subsurface leakage if this oil had completely saturated the sand it would have formed a layer approximately 5 mm thick immediately above the water table the water table in both columns was then maintained for 10 days the water table was then slowly varied following a pattern representative of rainfall infiltration followed by regional extraction the ri column while the water table in the other column was held static for the entire experiment the st column in the first stage of the ri experiment two episodes of rainfall infiltration were simulated the water table was raised by 20 cm to 60 cm above the base over a period of 50 h by injecting tap water into the top of the column using a peristaltic pump the simulated rainfall was not de aired at a flow rate of 1 06 ml min 1 see the supplementary material then held static for 16 days and then raised to 80 cm above the base over a second 50 h period in the second stage the water table was held static for 50 days in the third stage representing the impact of regional extraction the water table was lowered to 60 cm above the base over a period of 50 h by pumping groundwater out of the bottom of the column at a flow rate of 1 06 ml min 1 held static for 16 days and then lowered to 40 cm above the base at the same flow rate finally the water table was held static for 10 days the intended pattern of the water table during the first 120 days in the ri experiment can be seen from fig 1b it has similar characteristics to the variations that occur in most agricultural regions of china in response to seasonal rainfall and irrigation finally the water table was held static for an extended period of 90 days to examine whether changes in the bacterial community that resulted from the seasonal water table fluctuations persisted in the long term the process of water table fluctuations created three vertically separated zones within the ri column a continuously saturated zone from 0 to 40 cm above the base a zone of fluctuating saturation from 40 to 80 cm and a continuously unsaturated vadose zone from 80 to 110 cm 2 2 in situ monitoring and sand sampling the volumetric water contents in the vadose and fluctuating zones were monitored by tdr315l probes acclima usa that were embedded vertically at depths of about 80 100 cm and 50 70 cm above the base which were connected to a data logger cr300 campbell usa the dissolved oxygen in the vadose fluctuating and saturated zones were monitored by dp pst3 probes presens germany that were installed at depths of 90 cm 60 cm and 30 cm above the base which were connected to an oxy 10 trace sma meter presens germany sand samples from depths of 89 91 cm 59 61 cm and 29 31 cm above the base were collected after 20 40 90 110 120 and 210 days time points 1 6 using a 120 cm long 1 25 cm diameter direct push manual sampler ams usa further experimental details can be found in the supplementary material these samples were from the vadose zone v fluctuating zone f and saturated zone s respectively the sand samples were stored at 20 c for n alkane and biological analyses jurelevicius et al 2012 chen et al 2018 patil et al 2022 2 3 n alkane analysis the protocol for n alkane extraction and purification from the sand was based on previous studies liu et al 2018 after freeze drying approximately 1 0 g of sand sample was spiked with 0 5 ml 1 chlorooctadecane 0 0018 mg l 1 as a surrogate standard then extracted with 10 ml hexane using ultrasound at 80 khz for 40 min the supernatant was fractionalized by chromatographic column details in the supplementary material the fractions containing n alkane were reduced to less than 2 ml using rotary evaporation transferred to a 2 ml vial evaporated using nitrogen gas flow and then re dissolved in 1 ml hexane with phenanthrene 0 0004 mg l 1 as an internal standard the n alkanes were analyzed using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 6890 gas chromatograph with a 5975c mass selective detector agilent usa the gc was equipped with a capillary column j w hp 5 j w scientific inc usa more details can be found in the supplementary material 2 4 biological analysis total dna was extracted using powersoil dna kits mobio usa in accordance with the manufacturer s instruction the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr using the 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r

allwegene technology co ltd beijing china using standard protocols raw sequence reads were processed using the qiime version 1 2 1 see the supplementary material processed reads were assigned to operational defined taxonomic units otus using usearch version 10 edgar 2017 where otus were defined by minimum of 97 sequence identity between the putative otu members otus containing only one read singletons were not included in downstream analysis other otus were used to annotate the taxonomic information using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier version 2 2 wang et al 2007 against the silva128 16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 70 zhang et al 2020 mothur version 1 34 4 xi et al 2019 was used to conduct the alpha diversity analysis including rarefaction good s coverage observed species chao 1 and shannon index quantitative pcr qpcr was used on triplicate sub samples of each sand sample to measure the abundances of three alkb genes alk a alk r and alk p using 2 x taq mastermix cwbio china three separate primer pairs were used for each gene targeted see table s3 in the supplementary material kuhn et al 2009 marchant et al 2006 wang et al 2016 each reaction mixture contained 10 μl of sybr premix ex taq ii tli rnaseh plus roxplus takara china 0 5 μl each of the forward and reverse primers for the target gene table s3 2 μl of template dna and double distilled water to yield a total volume of 20 μl the pcr protocol was 95 c for 30 s 45 cycles at 95 c for 5 s and 60 c for 40 s then an increase of 0 05 c s 1 from 60 to 99 was performed to obtain the melting curve analysis of pcr products the standard curves were constructed with serial dilutions 10 fold of quantified plasmid dna containing the fragment of the alk a alk r and alk p

transformed for the rda 3 results 3 1 environmental characteristics 3 1 1 water content in the st column the volumetric water content at 50 cm above the water table the vadose zone gradually increased from 4 7 to 8 0 over the experiment fig 2 at the same location in the ri column the initial volumetric water content was similar to that in the st column but it increased rapidly each time the water table was raised to a maximum value of 34 8 on day 42 2 days after the water table reached its maximum but it then decreased while the water table was maintained at its highest level to a value of 27 2 when water table was lowered to its original level there was an 8 10 day lag in the response of volumetric water content in the vadose zone to each of the two decrements but it was 13 4 10 days after the water table was returned to its baseline level and then gradually decreased to 12 2 by the end of the experiment the volumetric water content at 20 cm above the baseline water table in the st column the mid point of the fluctuating zone in the ri column gradually decreased from 33 5 to 13 5 over the course of the experiment at the same location in the ri column the volumetric water content was initially 31 0 but decreased over the first 20 days while the water table was static to 24 2 introduction of the oil had only a small effect on this trend the volumetric water content then increased as the water table was raised to 28 5 when the water table was approximately at the level of the probe and 33 9 when the water table reached its highest level 20 cm above the probe the volumetric water content exhibited only minor variations when the water table was static at its highest level when water table in the ri column was lowered the response at the mid height in the fluctuating zone to the first decrement was very small it decreased to 32 7 and this response lagged 10 days behind the change in the water table there was a larger response to the second decrement with the volumetric water content decreasing rapidly to 25 0 after a lag of 10 days before gradually decreasing further to 17 1 by the end of the experiment 3 1 2 dissolved oxygen the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the vadose zone exhibited essentially the same response in the ri experiment and the st control with the initial value of about 8 7 mg l 1 close to equilibrium with atmosphere gradually decreasing over the course of the experiments to about 7 1 mg l 1 fig 3 at the mid point of the fluctuating zone 20 cm above the baseline water table the do concentration in the st column exhibited essentially the same response as in the vadose zone it decreased gradually from an initial value of 8 4 mg l 1 to 7 0 mg l 1 at the end of the experiment in contrast the do concentration in the ri column initially 8 6 mg l 1 remained similar to that value in the vadose zone only for the first 50 days the water table was raised to its highest level on day 40 but it then decayed to 0 mg l 1 over the next 20 days and maintained that value until about day 100 the water table was lowered to roughly the sensor level on day 92 the do concentration in the fluctuating zone of the ri column then gradually increased to a value of 7 5 mg l 1 over a period of 20 day and remained relatively steady at that value for the remaining 90 days of the experiments fig 3 the do concentration at 10 cm below the baseline water table the saturated zone exhibited essentially the same response in the st and ri columns with the initial value of 3 6 mg l 1 gradually decreasing to 0 mg l 1 over a period of 20 day and the do concentrations in the saturated zones of the columns did not increase again during the experiments fig 3 3 2 n alkane composition and concentration the total n alkane concentration in the ri column and st control varied with the sampling location relative the baseline water table see fig 4 which also shows the distribution of n alkanes by alkane chain length the total n alkane concentration in the st control varied principally with position relative to the water table the time averaged total n alkane concentration in the saturated zone 10 cm below the static water table was 12 0 mg kg 1 whereas it was 7 1 mg kg 1 at 20 cm above and 2 9 mg kg 1 at 50 cm above the static water table whilst these values which are the average from six time points show a consistent trend it is noted that they are similar in magnitude to the background total n alkane concentration in the aquifer sand 8 5 mg kg 1 see fig s1 so the difference may simply reflect natural variability in the sand in the ri column the time averaged total n alkane concentration in the fluctuating and vadose zones 10 9 mg kg 1 and 13 1 mg kg 1 respectively were both generally higher than those in the equivalent zones of the st control whereas in the saturated zone it was similar to the st control 9 7 mg kg 1 also the total n alkane concentrations in the ri column exhibited a temporal pattern that can be attributed to the change in the water table when the water table was raised the total n alkane concentration in the saturated and fluctuating zones progressively decreased from 19 7 mg kg 1 and 24 5 mg kg 1 to 3 0 mg kg 1 and 4 0 mg kg 1 respectively while the total n alkane concentration in the vadose zone increased from 9 4 mg kg 1 to 28 2 mg kg 1 however the pattern in the total n alkane concentrations in the ri column was less clear after the water table was lowered again but total n alkane concentration in the saturated fluctuating and vadose zones were all relatively low by the end of the experiment 3 6 mg kg 1 2 2 mg kg 1 and 2 6 mg kg 1 respectively 3 3 bacterial community diversity and structure the alpha diversity analysis indicates that the sequencing depth was sufficient to characterize the variations in the bacterial populations fig s2 and table s4 the good s coverage index 0 96 for all populations both measures of otu richness observed species and chao 1 index indicate that average otu richness over the duration of the experiments was slightly higher in the ri column than in the st control at all three locations table s4 however this difference may represent replicate variation between the columns as it is present in the first time point before the water table history differed and does not increase over time at phylum level the bacterial populations of the saturated and vadose zones of the st column exhibited only small variations with time in samples from the saturated zone about 40 of sequence reads were assigned to the bacterial phylum proteobacteria nearly a quarter were assigned to firmicutes and about 15 were assigned to actinobacteria fig 5 whereas in samples from the vadose zone 20 of sequence reads were assigned to the bacterial phylum proteobacteria 15 were assigned to firmicutes and nearly half were assigned to actinobacteria there was more variation between the samples taken from 20 cm above the water table in the st column the equivalent zone to fluctuating zone in the ri column but proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria were in all cases the three most abundant phyla the bacterial populations of the saturated zone of the ri column were broadly similar at phylum level to those in the saturated zone of the st column i e proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria were the three most abundant phyla however the proportion of the population assigned to the phylum proteobacteria increased to 60 immediately after simulated rainfall raised the water table and despite decreasing back to 40 with time and remaining at that level while the water table was lowered the proportion of the population assigned to proteobacteria increased to 50 in the long term after the simulated rainfall raised the water table the bacterial populations of the vadose zone of the ri column differed markedly even at phylum level from those of the vadose zone of the st column and were actually more comparable with the bacterial populations of samples taken from 20 cm above the water table in the st column over this period a third of sequences were assigned to proteobacteria and 20 were assigned to each of firmicutes and actinobacteria the proportion that were proteobacteria was highest immediately after the simulated rain event perhaps surprisingly the bacterial populations of the fluctuating zone of the ri column remained fairly constant with time despite the period of saturation during the experiment with about a third of sequences assigned to the phylum proteobacteria 20 assigned to actinobacteria and 15 assigned to firmicutes 3 4 alkane monooxygenase gene abundance in both the ri and st columns the abundance of the three alkb gene variants generally decreased in the order alk p alk r alk a fig 6 interestingly while there were only small variations in the abundance of these genes between the triplicate measurements from the same location suggesting good analytical repeatability there were considerable temporal variations in the abundance of each gene at each location however despite this temporal variability there are some patterns to gene abundance the abundance of the alk p gene generally decreased between sample locations in the order st vadose zone ri vadose zone st fluctuating zone equivalent zone of ri fluctuating zone ri fluctuating zone the saturated zones thus the time averaged abundance of the alk p gene was roughly correlated with the distance of the sample location from the water table although the differences in the time averaged abundance of the alk p gene in the st column were small the notable exception to this pattern was a very high abundance of the alk p gene in the saturated zone of the ri column immediately after the water table had been lowered the time averaged abundance of the alk r gene exhibited a similar pattern with sample locations and again showed a high abundance in the saturated zone of the ri column only for the single time point immediately after the water table had been lowered the abundance of the alk a gene was generally about two orders of magnitude lower than the alk p gene and it was generally slightly higher in saturated zone than the vadose and fluctuating zones especially at the time point immediately after the water table had been lowered 3 5 relationship among environmental characteristics n alkane bacterial communities and alkane monooxygenase genes rda analysis was performed to identify the factors driving temporal variations in bacterial community structure in different zones fig 7 for the vadose zone the first and second rda axes explained 52 and 19 of the variance respectively the water content had the largest significant effect on the bacterial community p 0 001 explaining 38 of the community variation table s5 the c10 c12 concentration had the second largest significant effect on community variation p 0 038 moreover multiple correlation analysis indicates that the total n alkane c10 c12 c17 c20 and c21 c25 concentrations have a significant positive correlation with water content table s6 the relative abundance of proteobacteria has a significant positive correlation with water content whereas the actinobacteria has a significant negative correlation with water content for the fluctuating zone the first two axes explained 49 of the variance and the c10 c12 concentration explained 22 of the community variation p 0 022 for the saturated zone the first two axes together explained 55 of the variance the c21 c25 concentration explained 20 of the community variation but with a lower degree of significance p 0 053 multiple correlation analysis also indicates the relationship between the alkb genes and dominant phyla but these are either localized to only one aquifer zone or suggest a correlation between an alkb gene variant and a bacterial phylum that does not contain genera reported to contain the gene table s7 so these correlations are unlikely to indicate causality 4 discussion 4 1 effects of water table fluctuations on environmental characteristics once the static water table was established there were only minor relatively slow changes in the geochemical conditions within the st column there was a very small gradual increase in the volumetric water content at 50 cm vadose zone and a decrease at 20 cm above the water table the fluctuating zone as a steady state pattern of decreasing volumetric water content with height above the water table was established in the absence of rainfall infiltration hou et al 2019 the do concentrations in both these unsaturated zones had a slight downward gradient but were at values close to equilibrium with atmospheric o2 at the laboratory temperature patel and vashi 2015 in contrast the do concentration in the saturated zone decreased steadily from the start of the experiment reaching zero shortly after time point 1 when the water table was raised in the ri column with the injection of the diesel fuel having little impact on the rate of decrease thus the influx of oxygen to the saturated zone was less than the rate of consumption and the saturated zone was essential anoxic xia et al 2020a importantly from time point 1 the geochemical conditions were essential steady in the st column in contrast the geochemical conditions in the vadose and fluctuating zones of the ri column varied with the water table after simulated rainfall saturation in the vadose zone peaked at about 80 shortly after the water table reached its highest level but dropped quickly to about 70 despite this high degree of saturation the do concentration was indistinguishable from that in the equivalent zone of the st column i e it was close to equilibrium with atmospheric o2 saturation decreased again as the water table was lowered and it was only slightly higher than that in the st column at the end of the experiment saturation in the fluctuating zone of the ri column also reached 80 saturation shortly after the water table reached its highest level but remained at that level whilst the water table was high and after a short delay the do concentration decreased to below the detection limit this suggests that the remaining pore air in the fluctuating zone is trapped in discrete bubbles which can persist for significant periods of time in shallow groundwater mcleod et al 2015 and as a result the do consumption by microbial respiration exceeded the rate of diffusion from above robinson 2019 højberg and sørensen 1993 there was less change in the geochemical conditions in the ri column below the initial water table the do concentration remained below the detection limit from shortly after time point 1 despite the translation of the simulated rainwater into this zone from the fluctuating zone when the water table was lowered 4 2 redistributions of n alkane caused by water table fluctuations diesel is a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl so it will have formed a 5 mm thick layer just above the water table it is also a non wetting liquid so negligible capillary rise would be expected and n alkanes c10 and above have negligible solubility in water therefore the modest concentrations of n alkanes in the fluctuating and vadose zones of the st column are probably mainly biogenic in origin produced by plants and associated with the soil organic matter this assumption is supported by the majority being longer n alkanes c17 c25 longer chain length n alkanes are waxes at or below room temperature nist 2021 and can cause diesel fuel to gel at lower temperatures whereas typically 90 of the n alkanes in diesel fuel are c10 c17 liang et al 2005 thus the time averaged n alkane concentrations in these zones of the st column which are very similar to the n alkane concentration in the fine river sand fig s1 represent the typical background levels in the columns in the saturated zone of the ri column the time averaged total n alkane concentration was similar to that in the saturated zone of the st column however the time averaged total n alkane concentration in the vadose and fluctuating zones were higher than those in the equivalent zones of the st column moreover when the water table was raised the total n alkane concentration in the ri column decreased in the saturated zone but increased in the fluctuating and vadose zones various n alkane components were significantly and positively correlated with water content in the vadose zone this suggests that the increase in water content led to increase of n alkane concentration under water table fluctuation previous studies kechavarzi et al 2005 have also shown that the n alkanes migrate upwards when the water table rises this is because diesel is a non polar liquid so mineral surfaces were strongly water wetted water will have readily displaces diesel from surfaces and so the diesel layer will have risen with the water table although a residual amount may have remained trapped in fine pores or associated with organic matter powers et al 1996 4 3 variations in bacterial community during water table fluctuations the bacterial communities in the st column exhibited only small variations with time but there is a progressive change in bacterial community with increasing height due to the decreasing availability of water and possibly the increasing availability of oxygen at all three locations the three most abundant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes however the proteobacteria which were dominant in the saturated zone were less abundant in the vadose zone 40 and 20 relative abundance respectively whereas actinobacteria which were third most abundant in the saturated zone were dominant in the vadose zone 15 and 50 relative abundance respectively there was also a slight trend of decreasing firmicutes relative abundance with height 25 in the saturated zone and 15 in the vadose zone at phylum level the bacterial populations in the fluctuating zone were more like those in the saturated zone than those in the vadose zone suggesting that the availability of water has a bigger impact on the populations than the availability of oxygen the do concentration in both the vadose and fluctuating zones were close to equilibrium with atmosphere whereas the saturated zone was anoxic similar moisture niche selection among these common soil phyla with actinobacteria more abundant at low and proteobacteria more abundant at high moisture values has been observed in fine sandy loam from a semi arid site evans et al 2014 bacterial communities dominated by proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes are found at other petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated soils gao et al 2014 lu et al 2014 liu et al 2020 and these populations have been identified as the dominant bacterial phyla with the capability of hydrocarbon metabolism smith et al 2015 shahi et al 2016 yang et al 2014 at phylum level the bacterial community in the saturated zone of the ri column was like that in the saturated zone of the st column when averaged over the experiment the relative abundance of the proteobacteria 45 was slightly higher and the firmicutes 15 was slightly lower than in the st column but the relative abundance of the actinobacteria was 15 in the saturated zone of both columns the modest differences in time averaged communities between the saturated zones were associated with temporal changes in the population of the ri column associated with movement of the water table there was an increase in the relative abundance of the proteobacteria and a decrease in the relative abundance of the firmicutes both at the end of the period when simulated rainfall raised the water table and 10 days after simulated regional extraction lowered the water table it is initially surprising that both raising and lowering the water table resulted in similar shifts in the bacterial populations but the causal process may be the same as rainfall infiltration results in downward percolation of water through unsaturated soil and contaminated capillary fringe to the edge of the saturated zone whereas drawdown carries accumulated rainwater from the fluctuating zone to the saturated zone these two processes delivered water bodies with similar geochemistry to the saturated zone most probably by introducing oxygen into the saturated zone due to the infiltration of oxygen containing rainwater and entrapment of oxygen from the fluctuating zone as the water table was decreased at phylum level the bacterial communities in the fluctuating and vadose zones of the ri column were obviously different from those in the st column water content was identified as the key factor shaping temporal variations in bacterial community in the vadose zone and c10 c12 was the driving factor of bacterial community in both the vadose and fluctuating zones moreover they were like that in the saturated zone although there is a decrease in the average relative abundance of the proteobacteria with height within the column 35 and 30 in the fluctuating and vadose zones respectively and a very small increase in the relative abundance of the actinobacteria 20 in both the fluctuating and vadose zones thus the higher average water content at both locations due to the variation in the water table moderated the moisture niche selective pressure that favoured proteobacteria species evans et al 2014 also the general similarity of the bacterial populations in the three zones may be an indication that fluctuations in the water table reduce the hydrological and geochemical differences between saturated fluctuating and vadose zones and smears the hydrocarbons between the zones leading to less difference in bacterial habitats provided hamamura et al 2013 4 4 variations in abundance of alkane monooxygenase gene during water table fluctuations bacterial degradation of n alkanes can occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions but is much faster under aerobic conditions widdel and rabus 2001 kloos et al 2006 the alkane monooxygenase a rubredoxin dependent enzyme kloos et al 2006 has been shown to be a key enzyme in the degradation of n alkanes in aerobic systems jurelevicius et al 2013 mckenna and coon 1970 three variants of the alkb gene that encodes the enzyme alkane monooxygenase were tracked in the column experiments these variants have been identified in the genome of hundreds of different bacterial species primarily from phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and spirochaetes jurelevicius et al 2013 yakimov et al 2004 wentzel et al 2007 kim et al 2021 nie et al 2014 in each zone of both the st and ri columns the abundance of three variants decreased in the order alk p alk r alk a in just one of the 36 samples alk a was slightly more abundant than alk r and overall alk p was 1000 more abundant than alk a in the st column the time averaged gene abundances show only modest differences with height in the column further there is no clear temporal pattern in the gene abundances in the fluctuating and vadose zones of this column given that soil organic matter usually contains low levels of n alkanes from plants these are probably the background abundances of the alkb gene variants in the bacterial populations of the soil however the abundance of all three gene variants exhibited a similar temporal pattern in the saturated zone of the st column first there was an increase in gene variant abundance between time points 1 and 2 then a decrease until time point 4 and only minor variations thereafter the initial increase in gene abundance may have been a response to the introduction of the diesel while the pore water still contained low levels of dissolved oxygen followed by a decrease in gene abundances once the system was fully anoxic thapa 2012 in the vadose zone of the ri column the time averaged abundances of all three gene variants were similar to the mean value in the st column whereas in the fluctuating zone they were slightly lower in the saturated zone of the ri column the time averaged abundances of all three gene variants were an order of magnitude higher than the mean value in the st column however this difference is associated with a 100 increase in the abundance of all three gene variants when the water table was lowered from its highest position time point 4 which was then not sustained once the water table was stable in its lower position if time point 4 is ignored the time averaged abundances of all three gene variants in the saturated zone of the ri column were similar to the mean value in the st column thus without spike when the water table was lowered the time averaged abundances of all three gene variants were very similar in the equivalent zones of the ri and st columns the increase in alkb gene variants in the saturated zone when the water table was lowered is most likely associated with transport of solutes or colloids from the fluctuating zone to bacteria species in saturated zone but it is unclear what that species might be trace dissolved oxygen dissolved organic matter nutrients etc however rapid changes in the bacterial community in the saturated zone due to infiltration of geochemically different water has been observed in other systems fillinger et al 2021 4 5 implications of the alkane monooxygenase gene distribution while elevated alkane concentrations in the subsurface environment are usually the result of contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons rojo 2009 alkanes are also produced by many living organisms such as plants and cyanobacteria and form part of the biomass in soil bush and mcinerney 2013 blumer et al 1971 schirmer et al 2010 kloos et al 2006 as a result alkanes are present at low concentrations in most soil and water environments brassell et al 1978 lee et al 2021a this is why alkane degrading microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature wentzel et al 2007 it is also why the abundance of the alkb gene variants was relatively uniform in the columns reported here with the exception of the ri column after the water table was lowered this suggests that the introduction of the diesel fuel into the columns generally had very little effect on the alkb gene abundance probably because the bacterial populations harboring alkb gene were habituated to biogenic alkanes associated with the soil organic matter and the abundances of bacteria carrying this gene were limited by factors other than the n alkane concentration more surprisingly the variation in the bacterial populations with height due to moisture niche selection with actinobacteria more abundant at low and proteobacteria more abundant at high moisture values also had very little effect on the alkb gene abundance possibly because numerous species in both phyla carry one or other alkb gene variant table s7 and references therein whilst there was little spatial variation in the abundance of the alkb gene variants despite differences in the bacterial populations with height in the column suggesting that moisture niche selection does not affect the alkb gene abundance there was a dramatic 100 increase in the abundance of all three alkb gene variants in the saturated zone of the ri column after the water table was lowered this was not directly associated with transfer of bacteria from a zone where the alkb gene abundance was high alkb gene abundance was not higher in the fluctuating zone or with an increase the n alkane concentration so it is inferred that it associated with some other factor affecting the growth of bacteria carrying the alkb gene this may be associated with the transport of a limiting factor to the saturated zone trace dissolved oxygen organic matter nutrients etc or equally may have been the result of mixing due to the water flow n alkanes are largely insoluble but reaction with a cell surface associated oxygenase requires cell contact wentzel et al 2007 so flow induced mixing may be an important factor whatever the cause it clearly demonstrates that a varying water table can significantly impact on the genetic potential to degrade n alkane in a system representative of a shallow unconfined aquifer 5 conclusions this study proposed that the vadose zone fluctuating zone saturated zone in a soil column must be considered as a continuum it reports the spatio temporal distribution of bacterial community and alkb gene abundance in a simulated diesel fuel lnapl contaminated aquifer during water table fluctuations alkb is an important gene for bacterial degradation of n alkanes the main component of diesel fuel it found by rda analysis that water content and n alkanes c10 c12 were the driver of temporal distribution of community structure in the vadose zone and c10 c12 was the driver of temporal distribution of community structure in the fluctuating zones meanwhile the community structure in the saturated zone shared a similar temporal trend with that in the static condition we found that moisture niches selection accounted for the vertical distribution of community structure in subsurface with relative abundance of proteobacteria increasing and actinobacteria decreasing with water content but seasonal water table fluctuations led to less difference between different zones in the continuum the abundances of the alkb gene variants were relatively uniform in different zones however variation in the water table caused a short term spike in alkb gene abundance in the saturated zone after the water table was lowered suggesting a fluctuating water table could increase functional potential to degrade n alkane in the shallow

1303,industrial contaminants and chemicals adversely impact surface water quality and may lead to serious health risks to human and ecosystems rivers as one of the major surface water resources receive wastewaters and transport dissolved pollutions in water through advection dispersion processes a minimum distance known as the mixing length is required for complete mixing and dispersion of the pollutants since the concentration of pollutants often exceeds the self purification capacity of rivers within this distance reducing it decreases the negative impacts on the aquatic ecosystems creating turbulent flows with inherent mixing characteristics is an efficient measure in decreasing the mixing length spur dikes that are widely used in river engineering are able to reduce the mixing length by virtue of the turbulence made in a stream given the fact that entry of pollutants into the surface water is inevitable and the influence of spur dikes on the characteristics of pollution transport has not been meticulously investigated this study aimed at the numerical simulation of pollution transport in a rectangular channel adjacent to a spur dike we thus invoked flow 3d to simulate flow and transport characteristics around an impermeable and non submerged rectangular spur dike the findings of this study enhance our understanding of spur dike effects on pollution transport notwithstanding the fact that the spur dike effectively decreased the mixing length of the pollution the location of the pollutant entry also played a prominent role in reducing the length

rather than groundwater in the recent decades more wastewater produced by municipal industrial and agricultural activities is discharged into surface waters and rivers this not only decreases the quality of water resources but also results in irreparable environmental damages when the concentration of pollutants exceeds the self purification capacity of rivers the aquatic ecosystem is drastically affected barry and sposito 1989 yadav et al 2010 chao et al 2004 toth et al 2019 there have been numerous researches on the fate and movement of hazardous pollutants such as microplastics and active metals in rivers and aquatic ecosystems studies reveal that anthropogenic activities are largely responsible for the abundance of these pollutants in rivers larkins et al 2018 transport of dissolved pollutants in a stream is primarily governed by a combination of advection dispersion and diffusion processes that contribute to decreasing the concentration based upon the characteristics of flow and pollutant the mentioned processes are typically affected by turbulence velocity fields and secondary flows which are mainly determined by morphology bed form flow rate and sometimes vegetation condition toprak and cigizoglu 2008 sokáč et al 2019 guleria et al 2020 baek and seo 2016 moro et al 2021 park and song 2018 changing the bed form in rivers and natural channels could significantly affect transport characteristics for instance it is feasible to accelerate reduction in the concentration of pollutants in water by providing or intensifying the mixing in the flow considering the rather high cost of mechanical induced mixing using the natural potential of rivers contributing to the mixing processes has drawn the attentions spur dikes are structures that prevent beach erosion by causing separation and directing flow from the shores to the middle of rivers or channels such structures could potentially enhance the dispersion of pollutants by providing a natural mixing sukhodolov and uijttewaal 2002 downstream of the structure higher velocity and closer streamlines around the spur dike would lead to flow separation and a rotational flow field duan et al 2010 cui et al 2008 hua et al 2008 nazari giglou et al 2018a 2018b jeon et al 2018 choufu et al 2019 in fact higher turbulence intensity affects the transport of dissolved pollutants and thus changes in the geometry of the spur dike may alter the flow and transport patterns effects of spur dike on flow patterns and turbulent characteristics in rivers and channels and consequently the sediment transport rates have been widely investigated azinfar and kells 2009 yu et al 2010 han et al 2018 gualtieri 2008 koken and gogus 2015 mccoy et al 2008 nepf and yang 2019 grant et al 2020 these studies have mainly discussed the scouring process sedimentation patterns and erosion in the vicinity of spur dikes ghodsian and vaghefi 2009 lodhi et al 2021 al khateeb et al 2016 radan and vaghefi 2016 zhang and nakagawa 2009 the exploitation of spur dikes in stream corridor restoration projects has gained a lot of attention in recent years as well within successive spur dikes i e the dead water zone particulate matter is held for a longer period of time and mean velocities are lower than the ones in the main channel engelhard et al 2004 furthermore the alteration in bathymetry engenders stable ponds and scour holes delivering habitats for aquatic organisms koken and constantinescu 2008 owing to the intrinsic limitations of laboratory measurements and analytical methods there is a growing interest in numerical techniques for solving complex flow problems with associated impacts on transport processes for instance hamza et al 2017 numerically modeled the sediment transport in two phase turbulent flows around an obstacle and proposed a commensurate hydrodynamic model precisely investigating pollution distribution around the obstacle and at the free surface despite the broad application of numerical modeling in simulating transport of pollutants in different flow regimes iqbal et al 2018 lack of research on the effect of spur dikes on the transport of point source pollutants in surface flows and self purification capacity of rivers is evident considering the 3d nature of the flow in the vicinity of spur dikes chen et al 2012 the flow modeling around them requires a 3d approach the main objective of the present study is modeling water flow and solute transport around a non submerged spur dike using the flow 3d software and providing design guidelines for structural parameters such as spur dike s length and also the optimum location for pollutants entry the effect of hydraulic parameters such as flow rate on pollution transport is then investigated we first explain the governing equations and basis of the numerical model next numerically simulated flows around a spur dike are compared with available experimental results from literature finally the pollutant entry into the flow is simulated and variations in spur dike structural parameters and hydraulic conditions of the flow on transport characteristics and mixing length are addressed fig 1 presents the general sketch of the problem under study 2 methodology 2 1 flow 3d model flow 3d software has been recognized as a robust computational fluid dynamics platform simulating flow turbulence bedload and suspended load subjected to various boundary conditions this software using a finite difference algorithm can resolve 3d navier stokes equations under nonhydrostatic conditions making it well suited to study free surface flows and sediment transport xie 2011 besides this such simulation software is also capable of representing various modules such as markers and particles of mass 2 2 governing equations 2 2 1 continuity and momentum equations mass conservation and momentum equations are governing equations of fluid motion in flow 3d eqs 1 to 4 in addition flow 3d uses volume of fluid vof and fractional area volume obstacle representation favor for indicating the fluid behavior at the free surface and simulating complicated geometries respectively to determine the free surface and boundary conditions some simplifications are made in the given partial equations the advantage of vof method is the fact that fluid is inside a constant flow network with no deformations or displacements substitution of the gas filled volume with a space filled volume further improves computational efficiency accordingly the governing equations of fluid flow are written as 1 v f ρ t x

used available experimental results of yu et al 2010 for validation of flow simulation by flow 3d next chen et al s 2012 experimental results were used to evaluate performance of flow 3d in simulating transport of dissolved pollutants around a non submerged spur dike 3 2 simulation of flow around the spur dike 3 2 1 experimental study of yu et al 2010 yu et al 2010 studied flow around a spur dike through the use of a glass laboratory flume with rectangular cross section and smooth bed and walls a single impermeable and non submerged spur dike with dimensions of 0 1 m in flow direction and 0 5 m perpendicular to the flow direction was installed in a flume that was 30 m in length 2 m in width and 0 12 m in height the spur dike was placed at a distance of 3 8 m from the beginning of the flume seeking to provide a constant flow depth a tailgate was exploited at the flume downstream the mean water depth and flow rate at steady flow condition were measured as 0 1024 m and 0 0661 m3 s respectively the velocity distribution around the structure was measured in both longitudinal and lateral directions by a ldv with stated accuracy of 1 there were four measurement points in each vertical line to obtain velocity distribution in depth also the water depth was recorded by a point gauge with less than 0 5 error 3 2 2 numerical simulation of flow the flow field was calculated by solving reynolds averaged navier stokes and large eddy simulation of turbulence the simulation in flow 3d commenced based on the measurements of yu et al 2010 with water depth of 0 1024 m and constant inlet flow rate of 0 0661 m3 s also fixed boundary conditions were assumed at the channel outlet by which the flow characteristics at this point were kept unchanged and thereby assigned to the outside of the solution field the wall boundary condition was applied to the sidewalls and the channel bed while symmetric boundary condition was considered for the upper face of the solution field table 1 represents list of parameters in numerical simulation of flow based on yu et al s 2010 experimental study also fig 2 indicates characteristics of the solution field in flow 3d numerical model for simulation water was considered as a completely incompressible fluid the kinematic viscosity of water was set to 10 6 m2 s at 20 c same conditions used by yu et al 2010 also no slip condition was assumed at the boundary of the fluid and the channel due to the presence of high pressure gradient and momentum fields the ratio of adjacent cells is considered close to 1 in all mesh blocks of the solution domain especially in the areas close to the spur dike a rectangular channel with respective length width and height along the x y and z axes of 13 8 m 2 m and 0 12 m was modeled in flow 3d as seen in fig 2 the spur dike was placed at a distance of 3 8 m from the channel inlet the numerical model consisted of 188 700 coarse cells 2 cm in all directions and 943 500 fine cells a distance of 1 cm in all directions add to that a very fine mesh was considered around the spur dike providing higher accuracy in results this numerical simulation was carried out by a core i7 5720 kghz processor and 12 gb ram 3 3 simulation of dissolved pollution transport 3 3 1 experimental study of chen et al 2012 chen et al 2012 experimentally investigated the pollution transport using a laboratory flume with 0 4 m width and depth and 14 m length with a slope of 3 700 a rectangular spur dike with dimensions of 0 1 m perpendicular to the flow direction 0 1 m in the vertical direction and 0 015 m in the flow direction was installed in the middle of channel the angles of spur dike were set to 60o 90o and 120o with respect to the upstream the flow rate was 0 0036 m3 s and details of velocity field were monitored using a ldv the continuous entry of pollution was mimicked by potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 with an initial concentration of 2 g lit marked with a red dot in fig 3 the initial location of pollutant entry was at x 0 1 m and y 0 05 m upstream of the structure a spectral photometer was used to measure the pollutant concentration 3 3 2 numerical simulation of pollutant entry into the flow since this study is aimed at studying the transport of dissolved pollution around a spur dike installed perpendicular to the wall our simulation results are only compared with those corresponding to 90o spur dike in chen et al 2012 the pollutant is entered near the channel wall upstream the spur dike as marked in fig 3 the flow rate average flow depth channel length width and height were set in the numerical solution as 0 0036 m3 s 0 087 m 14 m and 0 4 m respectively also in accordance with chen et al 2012 the spur dike is 0 015 m thick with a length and height of 0 1 m located at the distance of 1 m from the channel inlet the computational zone around the spur dike is 3 m long 0 4 m wide and 0 2 m high to simulate the pollutant entry into the channel a dissolved pollutant with physical and chemical properties of potassium dihydrogen phosphate with an initial concentration of 2 g lit was released on the water surface at 0 1 m upstream the structure the parameters used in numerical simulation of pollution transport based on chen et al s 2012 experimental study are listed in table 2 3 4 investigating the effects of spur dike length pollutant entry point and flow rate on transport processes we designed different scenarios in flow 3d to numerically investigate the effects of spur dike s length and entry point of pollutant on transport and distribution of dissolved matter within the flow hence different cases of pollutant entry into the flow with respect to the different lengths of the dike i e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 m were considered note that these scenarios were investigated in a channel with characteristics similar to the one in yu et al 2010 see fig 2 for details different scenarios of the pollution entry depicted in fig 4 are summarized as case a pollution entry before the spur dike from the center of channel case b pollution entry at the beginning of spur dike case c pollution entry from the center of rotational zone determined by the velocity filed case d pollution entry from the middle of channel width between the nose of spur dike and the opposing wall case e pollution entry from the point located 0 5 m before the structure on the sidewall we first simulate cases a to e and then discuss the effect of hydraulic flow rate and depth of pollution entry on transport processes 4 results and discussion 4 1 flow simulation around the spur dike as mentioned in section 3 1 we first investigated the flow problem around the spur dike by checking the velocity distribution and water level profiles to find the appropriate length of the channel in numerical simulation of flow the channel length was first reduced to 9 m compared to the channel length of 13 8 m it was understood that errors of water surface level and velocity distribution are larger for the length of 9 m moreover we found that channel length more than 13 8 m could lead to a pointless increase in the solution

profile in x direction u x around the spur dike by flow 3d with experimental findings of yu et al 2010 the presence of flow around the spur dike increases the velocity and thereby the maximum calculated and experimental velocities are 0 51 m s and 0 62 m s respectively the existing difference between maximum numerical and experimental velocities 0 11 m s could be partly attributed to the computational errors and also the errors of data processing techniques the mentioned difference is highest at the final section x 4 03 m where the computational velocity is less than experimental values for most points in x direction fig 6 provides a comparison between the computed water depth at different cross sections around the spur dike and the experimental values of yu et al 2010 as seen compared to downstream of the spur dike the water level is higher at its upstream i e x 3 8 m in addition a gradual increase in water level nicely captured by flow 3d is observed as moving away from the spur dike according to fig 6 a reasonable agreement is observed between flow 3d and experimental results with a relative difference of less than 0 5 the maximum water depth near the spur dike downstream was calculated 10 74 cm highlighting a good agreement with the measured 10 80 cm 4 2 simulation of pollution transport to evaluate performance of flow 3d in modeling dissolved pollution transport around the spur dike experimental findings of chen et al 2012 at x 1 12 m and 1 27 m were used note that the pollution distribution around the spur dike is intricate due to its 3d nature the pollution concentration varies as moving away from the spur dike located at x 1 m fig 7a illustrates the variations in the dissolved pollutant concentration at a distance of 0 12 m x 1 12 m from the spur dike for the given section the pollutant concentration within the rotational flow zone y 0 01 m and 0 09 m was smoothly raised to a peak value due to the less pollution transport by the flow compared to the mentioned section the concentration was sharply increased in the rotational zone for the section placed at 0 27 m from the spur dike x 1 27 m due to stronger advection flows fig 7b the time series of dissolved pollution concentration around the spur dike at the cross section of x 1 27 m is shown in fig 7b the point of y 0 17 m lies within the main flow whereas y 0 01 m and y 0 09 m are positioned in the rotational flow zone the concentration at y 0 01 m and y 0 09 m would be zero once the concentration of dissolved pollution reaches a maximum at y 0 17 m on the other hand the concentration at y 0 01 m and y 0 09 m gradually increased while in the meantime the pollution concentration at y 0 17 m drastically decreased also the pollution concentration at t 10 s is the same for all three points however the concentration within the rotational flow zone is higher than the main flow shortly after this time it can be observed in fig 6b that for the main flow zone the concentration initially reached a maximum value and thereafter rapidly decreased on the other hand for the rotational zone variation in the concentration prior to the maximum value and consequently its reduction is much slower 4 3 the effects of dike length location of pollution entry and changes in hydraulic parameters the agreement between simulation results of flow and solute transport with experimental findings highlights the potential applicability of flow 3d in design considerations see table 5 we thus employed flow 3d to systematically address the effect of spur dike length perpendicular to the flow direction the position of pollution entry and hydraulic parameters on the extent of pollution zone within the flow accordingly different entry points and different spur dike lengths were primarily studied note that cases a to e were investigated with different spur dike lengths ranging from 0 to 0 7 m steps of 0 1 m table 6 represents all scenarios regarding the length of the pollution zone in the channel the length of pollution zone is defined as the distance from the pollutant entry where concentration of dissolved pollution reaches an allowable value here 0 1 of the initial concentration the height of the spur dike and the flow rate in the channel were kept constant in all scenarios as 0 12 m and 0 0661 m3 s respectively according to table 6 the minimum length of the polluted zone is obtained in case c with the spur dike length of 0 1 m therefore this case is considered as the optimum case to further investigate the effect of flow rate on the extent of pollution zone the entry coordinates of the pollutant in case c obtained from the velocity field are given in table 7 fig 8 displays the pollution distribution in case c for different lengths of the spur dike i e 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 m the x axis is directed in channel length and the transverse axis indicates the channel width of 2 m the results are shown within the range of x 3 38 m before the spur dike and x 7 54 m to focus on the details of the pollution zone i e the mixing length note that the length of the spur dike is indicated for each case as seen without spur dike the pollutant transports a long distance 3 241 m from the entry point to reach the allowable concentration for the spur dike with the length of 0 1 m the pollutant concentration reaches the allowable concentration after 0 355 m fig 9 depicts the maximum relative pollution concentration along the channel for different flow rates in case c fig 9a shows the pollution distribution for the flow rate of 0 0661 m3 s the pollutant needs a distance of 3 241 m in a channel without spur dike and 0 355 m in a channel with 0 1 m spur dike to reach allowable concentration the simulation results of case c based on the constant water depth and doubled flow rate 0 1322 m3 s are depicted in fig 9b the increase in flow rate i e flow velocity increases mixing and effectively decreases pollution concentration accordingly this would reduce the required distance reaching the allowable concentration due to the enhancement of the dispersion coefficients fig 10 demonstrates the pollution distribution in the x z plane in which the pollutant entry is at the bottom of the channel at depth of z 0 06 m and at the surface marked with red points the length of the pollution zone in the above mentioned cases was obtained as 0 217 m 0 254 m and 0 355 m respectively these results highlight that the shortest length of the pollution zone is obtained when pollutant entry is at the bottom of the channel 5 summary and conclusions in this study the effect of a single non submerged spur dike on pollution transport within water channels was numerically investigated using flow 3d results revealed better mixing of pollution and reduction in the length of the pollution zone due to the mixings caused in the presence of spur dike the main findings of the numerical simulations can be summarized as exploitation of spur dike could reduce the length of the pollution zone notwithstanding this fact the pollutant entry point also plays a prominent role for different scenarios of the case c with pollutant entry near the rotational zone of the flow decreasing the length of spur dike reduces the length of pollution zone aiming at providing the most appropriate results the pollutant entry points must be set at the location of rotation zone in the flow in order to reduce the extent of the pollution zone it is recommended to enter the pollution from lower water depths authorship statement all persons who meet authorship

1303,industrial contaminants and chemicals adversely impact surface water quality and may lead to serious health risks to human and ecosystems rivers as one of the major surface water resources receive wastewaters and transport dissolved pollutions in water through advection dispersion processes a minimum distance known as the mixing length is required for complete mixing and dispersion of the pollutants since the concentration of pollutants often exceeds the self purification capacity of rivers within this distance reducing it decreases the negative impacts on the aquatic ecosystems creating turbulent flows with inherent mixing characteristics is an efficient measure in decreasing the mixing length spur dikes that are widely used in river engineering are able to reduce the mixing length by virtue of the turbulence made in a stream given the fact that entry of pollutants into the surface water is inevitable and the influence of spur dikes on the characteristics of pollution transport has not been meticulously investigated this study aimed at the numerical simulation of pollution transport in a rectangular channel adjacent to a spur dike we thus invoked flow 3d to simulate flow and transport characteristics around an impermeable and non submerged rectangular spur dike the findings of this study enhance our understanding of spur dike effects on pollution transport notwithstanding the fact that the spur dike effectively decreased the mixing length of the pollution the location of the pollutant entry also played a prominent role in reducing the length

rather than groundwater in the recent decades more wastewater produced by municipal industrial and agricultural activities is discharged into surface waters and rivers this not only decreases the quality of water resources but also results in irreparable environmental damages when the concentration of pollutants exceeds the self purification capacity of rivers the aquatic ecosystem is drastically affected barry and sposito 1989 yadav et al 2010 chao et al 2004 toth et al 2019 there have been numerous researches on the fate and movement of hazardous pollutants such as microplastics and active metals in rivers and aquatic ecosystems studies reveal that anthropogenic activities are largely responsible for the abundance of these pollutants in rivers larkins et al 2018 transport of dissolved pollutants in a stream is primarily governed by a combination of advection dispersion and diffusion processes that contribute to decreasing the concentration based upon the characteristics of flow and pollutant the mentioned processes are typically affected by turbulence velocity fields and secondary flows which are mainly determined by morphology bed form flow rate and sometimes vegetation condition toprak and cigizoglu 2008 sokáč et al 2019 guleria et al 2020 baek and seo 2016 moro et al 2021 park and song 2018 changing the bed form in rivers and natural channels could significantly affect transport characteristics for instance it is feasible to accelerate reduction in the concentration of pollutants in water by providing or intensifying the mixing in the flow considering the rather high cost of mechanical induced mixing using the natural potential of rivers contributing to the mixing processes has drawn the attentions spur dikes are structures that prevent beach erosion by causing separation and directing flow from the shores to the middle of rivers or channels such structures could potentially enhance the dispersion of pollutants by providing a natural mixing sukhodolov and uijttewaal 2002 downstream of the structure higher velocity and closer streamlines around the spur dike would lead to flow separation and a rotational flow field duan et al 2010 cui et al 2008 hua et al 2008 nazari giglou et al 2018a 2018b jeon et al 2018 choufu et al 2019 in fact higher turbulence intensity affects the transport of dissolved pollutants and thus changes in the geometry of the spur dike may alter the flow and transport patterns effects of spur dike on flow patterns and turbulent characteristics in rivers and channels and consequently the sediment transport rates have been widely investigated azinfar and kells 2009 yu et al 2010 han et al 2018 gualtieri 2008 koken and gogus 2015 mccoy et al 2008 nepf and yang 2019 grant et al 2020 these studies have mainly discussed the scouring process sedimentation patterns and erosion in the vicinity of spur dikes ghodsian and vaghefi 2009 lodhi et al 2021 al khateeb et al 2016 radan and vaghefi 2016 zhang and nakagawa 2009 the exploitation of spur dikes in stream corridor restoration projects has gained a lot of attention in recent years as well within successive spur dikes i e the dead water zone particulate matter is held for a longer period of time and mean velocities are lower than the ones in the main channel engelhard et al 2004 furthermore the alteration in bathymetry engenders stable ponds and scour holes delivering habitats for aquatic organisms koken and constantinescu 2008 owing to the intrinsic limitations of laboratory measurements and analytical methods there is a growing interest in numerical techniques for solving complex flow problems with associated impacts on transport processes for instance hamza et al 2017 numerically modeled the sediment transport in two phase turbulent flows around an obstacle and proposed a commensurate hydrodynamic model precisely investigating pollution distribution around the obstacle and at the free surface despite the broad application of numerical modeling in simulating transport of pollutants in different flow regimes iqbal et al 2018 lack of research on the effect of spur dikes on the transport of point source pollutants in surface flows and self purification capacity of rivers is evident considering the 3d nature of the flow in the vicinity of spur dikes chen et al 2012 the flow modeling around them requires a 3d approach the main objective of the present study is modeling water flow and solute transport around a non submerged spur dike using the flow 3d software and providing design guidelines for structural parameters such as spur dike s length and also the optimum location for pollutants entry the effect of hydraulic parameters such as flow rate on pollution transport is then investigated we first explain the governing equations and basis of the numerical model next numerically simulated flows around a spur dike are compared with available experimental results from literature finally the pollutant entry into the flow is simulated and variations in spur dike structural parameters and hydraulic conditions of the flow on transport characteristics and mixing length are addressed fig 1 presents the general sketch of the problem under study 2 methodology 2 1 flow 3d model flow 3d software has been recognized as a robust computational fluid dynamics platform simulating flow turbulence bedload and suspended load subjected to various boundary conditions this software using a finite difference algorithm can resolve 3d navier stokes equations under nonhydrostatic conditions making it well suited to study free surface flows and sediment transport xie 2011 besides this such simulation software is also capable of representing various modules such as markers and particles of mass 2 2 governing equations 2 2 1 continuity and momentum equations mass conservation and momentum equations are governing equations of fluid motion in flow 3d eqs 1 to 4 in addition flow 3d uses volume of fluid vof and fractional area volume obstacle representation favor for indicating the fluid behavior at the free surface and simulating complicated geometries respectively to determine the free surface and boundary conditions some simplifications are made in the given partial equations the advantage of vof method is the fact that fluid is inside a constant flow network with no deformations or displacements substitution of the gas filled volume with a space filled volume further improves computational efficiency accordingly the governing equations of fluid flow are written as 1 v f ρ t x

coefficient pletcher et al 2012 3 materials and methods 3 1 numerical model development considering that correct simulation of flow is the key for resolving the pollution transport problem we first used available experimental results of yu et al 2010 for validation of flow simulation by flow 3d next chen et al s 2012 experimental results were used to evaluate performance of flow 3d in simulating transport of dissolved pollutants around a non submerged spur dike 3 2 simulation of flow around the spur dike 3 2 1 experimental study of yu et al 2010 yu et al 2010 studied flow around a spur dike through the use of a glass laboratory flume with rectangular cross section and smooth bed and walls a single impermeable and non submerged spur dike with dimensions of 0 1 m in flow direction and 0 5 m perpendicular to the flow direction was installed in a flume that was 30 m in length 2 m in width and 0 12 m in height the spur dike was placed at a distance of 3 8 m from the beginning of the flume seeking to provide a constant flow depth a tailgate was exploited at the flume downstream the mean water depth and flow rate at steady flow condition were measured as 0 1024 m and 0 0661 m3 s respectively the velocity distribution around the structure was measured in both longitudinal and lateral directions by a ldv with stated accuracy of 1 there were four measurement points in each vertical line to obtain velocity distribution in depth also the water depth was recorded by a point gauge with less than 0 5 error 3 2 2 numerical simulation of flow the flow field was calculated by solving reynolds averaged navier stokes and large eddy simulation of turbulence the simulation in flow 3d commenced based on the measurements of yu et al 2010 with water depth of 0 1024 m and constant inlet flow rate of 0 0661 m3 s also fixed boundary conditions were assumed at the channel outlet by which the flow characteristics at this point were kept unchanged and thereby assigned to the outside of the solution field the wall boundary condition was applied to the sidewalls and the channel bed while symmetric boundary condition was considered for the upper face of the solution field table 1 represents list of parameters in numerical simulation of flow based on yu et al s 2010 experimental study also fig 2 indicates characteristics of the solution field in flow 3d numerical model for simulation water was considered as a completely incompressible fluid the kinematic viscosity of water was set to 10 6 m2 s at 20 c same conditions used by yu et al 2010 also no slip condition was assumed at the boundary of the fluid and the channel due to the presence of high pressure gradient and momentum fields the ratio of adjacent cells is considered close to 1 in all mesh blocks of the solution domain especially in the areas close to the spur dike a rectangular channel with respective length width and height along the x y and z axes of 13 8 m 2 m and 0 12 m was modeled in flow 3d as seen in fig 2 the spur dike was placed at a distance of 3 8 m from the channel inlet the numerical model consisted of 188 700 coarse cells 2 cm in all directions and 943 500 fine cells a distance of 1 cm in all directions add to that a very fine mesh was considered around the spur dike providing higher accuracy in results this numerical simulation was carried out by a core i7 5720 kghz processor and 12 gb ram 3 3 simulation of dissolved pollution transport 3 3 1 experimental study of chen et al 2012 chen et al 2012 experimentally investigated the pollution transport using a laboratory flume with 0 4 m width and depth and 14 m length with a slope of 3 700 a rectangular spur dike with dimensions of 0 1 m perpendicular to the flow direction 0 1 m in the vertical direction and 0 015 m in the flow direction was installed in the middle of channel the angles of spur dike were set to 60o 90o and 120o with respect to the upstream the flow rate was 0 0036 m3 s and details of velocity field were monitored using a ldv the continuous entry of pollution was mimicked by potassium dihydrogen phosphate kh2po4 with an initial concentration of 2 g lit marked with a red dot in fig 3 the initial location of pollutant entry was at x 0 1 m and y 0 05 m upstream of the structure a spectral photometer was used to measure the pollutant concentration 3 3 2 numerical simulation of pollutant entry into the flow since this study is aimed at studying the transport of dissolved pollution around a spur dike installed perpendicular to the wall our simulation results are only compared with those corresponding to 90o spur dike in chen et al 2012 the pollutant is entered near the channel wall upstream the spur dike as marked in fig 3 the flow rate average flow depth channel length width and height were set in the numerical solution as 0 0036 m3 s 0 087 m 14 m and 0 4 m respectively also in accordance with chen et al 2012 the spur dike is 0 015 m thick with a length and height of 0 1 m located at the distance of 1 m from the channel inlet the computational zone around the spur dike is 3 m long 0 4 m wide and 0 2 m high to simulate the pollutant entry into the channel a dissolved pollutant with physical and chemical properties of potassium dihydrogen phosphate with an initial concentration of 2 g lit was released on the water surface at 0 1 m upstream the structure the parameters used in numerical simulation of pollution transport based on chen et al s 2012 experimental study are listed in table 2 3 4 investigating the effects of spur dike length pollutant entry point and flow rate on transport processes we designed different scenarios in flow 3d to numerically investigate the effects of spur dike s length and entry point of pollutant on transport and distribution of dissolved matter within the flow hence different cases of pollutant entry into the flow with respect to the different lengths of the dike i e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 and 0 7 m were considered note that these scenarios were investigated in a channel with characteristics similar to the one in yu et al 2010 see fig 2 for details different scenarios of the pollution entry depicted in fig 4 are summarized as case a pollution entry before the spur dike from the center of channel case b pollution entry at the beginning of spur dike case c pollution entry from the center of rotational zone determined by the velocity filed case d pollution entry from the middle of channel width between the nose of spur dike and the opposing wall case e pollution entry from the point located 0 5 m before the structure on the sidewall we first simulate cases a to e and then discuss the effect of hydraulic flow rate and depth of pollution entry on transport processes 4 results and discussion 4 1 flow simulation around the spur dike as mentioned in section 3 1 we first investigated the flow problem around the spur dike by checking the velocity distribution and water level

in this study the effect of a single non submerged spur dike on pollution transport within water channels was numerically investigated using flow 3d results revealed better mixing of pollution and reduction in the length of the pollution zone due to the mixings caused in the presence of spur dike the main findings of the numerical simulations can be summarized as exploitation of spur dike could reduce the length of the pollution zone notwithstanding this fact the pollutant entry point also plays a prominent role for different scenarios of the case c with pollutant entry near the rotational zone of the flow decreasing the length of spur dike reduces the length of pollution zone aiming at providing the most appropriate results the pollutant entry points must be set at the location of rotation zone in the flow in order to reduce the extent of the pollution zone it is recommended to enter the pollution from lower water depths authorship statement all persons who meet authorship

1304,the provision of clean water is still a major challenge in developing parts of the world as emphasized by the united nation sustainable development goals sdg 6 and has remained a subject of extensive research globally advancements in science and industry have resulted in a massive surge in the amount of industrial chemicals produced within the last few decades persistent and emerging organic pollutants are detected in aquatic environments and conventional wastewater treatment plants have ineffectively handled these trace bioaccumulative and toxic compounds therefore we have conducted an extensive bibliometric analysis of different materials utilized to combat organic pollutants via adsorption and photocatalysis the classes of pollutants material synthesis mechanisms of interaction merits and challenges were comprehensively discussed the paper highlights the advantages of various materials used in the removal of hazardous pollutants from wastewater with activated carbon having the highest adsorption capacity dyes pharmaceuticals endocrine disrupting chemicals pesticides and other recalcitrant organic pollutants have been successfully removed at high degradation efficiencies through the photocatalytic process the photocatalytic degradation and adsorption processes were compared by considering factors such as cost efficiency ease of application and reusability this review will be good resource material for water treatment professionals scientists who may be interested in adsorptive and photocatalytic remediation of organic chemicals pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorbent photocatalyst carbon based material organic chemical pollutant water treatment 1 introduction the presence of chemical pollutants in water bodies has raised global concern emerging contaminants are various unregulated or newly regulated compounds and their transformation products with the potential to have adverse impacts on environmental and human health adeola et al 2022a 2022b tavengwa and dalu 2021 these contaminants include micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products surfactants biocides plasticizers dyes illicit drugs endocrine disruptors pesticides and herbicides sanganyado 2021 khan et al 2022a mashile et al 2022 it was reported that an estimated 350 000 chemicals are in use and an alarming amount of waste of roughly over 1 8 billion kg waste are released daily into aquatic bodies worldwide wang et al 2020 the estimated volume of wastewater generated annually is not less than six times the volume of global aquatic freshwater furthermore acute and chronic exposure to chemical pollutants has reportedly led to diverse toxicological effects for both humans and aquatic fauna even at trace concentrations ng l to μg l concentrations in fluids or ng kg to μg kg in solid matrices sanganyado 2021 the provision of clean water as emphasized by the united nation sustainable development goals un sdgs is still a major challenge especially in developing parts of the world unsdg 2018 therefore concerted and extensive efforts have been directed globally towards the development of suitable efficient and ecofriendly remediation strategies for persistent and emerging chemical pollutants various techniques have been employed in the removal of toxic compounds from wastewater including phytoremediation masinire et al 2021 advanced oxidation processes khan et al 2014 khan et al 2021a adsorption wang et al 2019 2022a adeola and forbes 2019 2020 membrane treatments laqbaqbi et al 2019 coagulation dotto et al 2019 biological treatment goswami et al 2018 khan et al 2022b some of these technologies have drawbacks such as high cost of operation complex operation and production of high quantity of sludge adeola and forbes 2021 iqbal et al 2022 mashile et al 2022 among such technologies adsorption and photocatalysis have received vast attention due to their potential for practical application with advantages such as low cost safety and reliability khan et al 2021b adsorption is regarded as a surface phenomenon where organic and inorganic compounds adhere to an adsorbent s surface via physical or and chemical attractive forces while photocatalytic degradation involves the use of a catalyst often a semiconductor to accelerate the chemical transformation of pollutants via ultraviolet or visible light radiation li et al 2021a 2021b bayode et al 2021a the concept of green chemistry includes a reduction in waste generation secondary pollutants safer chemical syntheses development of less hazardous products chemicals development of regenerable renewable materials ensuring degradability of products materials after use to prevent pollution etc anastas and eghbali 2010 wang et al 2022a it also involves the conversion of waste such as volcanic ashes and sludge based materials into value added materials like adsorbents for the removal of pollutants from the environment mu azu et al 2022 liadi et al 2021 adopting a green synthesis approach in the development of adsorbents and photocatalysts could break the vicious cycle of replacing hazardous substances with an equally toxic and bioaccumulative compound the decision to explore carbon based materials for water treatment was driven by the concept of sustainable chemistry and the need to address waste management challenges and the conversion of waste to wealth is a cost effective path to proper waste management malik et al 2015 vishnu et al 2021 therefore green chemistry techniques can be employed as a viable and eco friendly alternative for water purification this comprehensive review provides a status report on adsorbents and photocatalysts as combatants of chemical pollutants worldwide discussing various synthetic approaches applications merits limitations and drawing comparisons between both core techniques of environmental remediation the aquatic environment is interconnected globally thus water treatment challenges in developing countries and prospects were discussed the literature scope of this review is based on scopus and web of science published articles and books while the search keywords are adsorbents photocatalyst emerging chemical pollutants ecp persistent organic pollutants pop photocatalytic degradation adsorption and remediation 2 chemical pollutants as the enemy there is a massive surge in the amount of industrial chemicals produced within the last century between 1 and 400 million tons in the year 2000 unep 2019 furthermore the manufacturing capacity of industries globally improved from 1 2 billion tons to 2 3 billion tons between the years 2000 and 2017 sanganyado 2021 however this staggering increase in production capacity which is currently experienced in the fourth industrial revolution as a result of advancement in science has also resulted in emerging worrisome realities the world health organization who reported that chemical pollution resulted in 1 6 million deaths in 2018 worldwide das and horton 2018 naidu et al 2021 pharmaceuticals and personal care products such as antiretroviral drugs antidepressants anti cancer drugs antibiotics etc are detected in municipal hospital and industrial wastewater effluent adeola et al 2022b adeola and forbes 2022 battell et al 2022 they are toxic to the environment and human health even at low concentrations and are a result of discharge from urban and farm wastewater as well as partially treated water from pharmaceutical industries ihsanullah et al 2022 on the other hand pesticides and veterinary drugs are frequently detected in agriculture runoff and urban stormwater casado et al 2019 landfill leachate and industrial wastewater often convey indiscriminately released chemicals such as flame retardants dyes surfactants and toxic heavy metals gwenzi and chaukura 2018 ibigbami et al 2022 chemical pollutants are ubiquitous in aquatic systems due to various anthropogenic applications and the interconnected nature of various aquatic systems table 1 over 5000 drugs are in use currently and as many as 631 have been detected in freshwater aquatic systems in various parts of the world aus der beek et al 2016 the presence of different antimicrobial and antiviral drugs has been reported in several african and european aquatic systems funke et al 2016 kairigo et al 2020 sixty eight chemical pollutants including antimicrobial agents and pesticides that have never been detected in kenyan water bodies were reported in a recent study kandie et al 2020 in eastern nigeria toxic organic compounds with high risk quotients such as bisphenol a erythromycin chloramphenicol triclosan and triclocarban were found in rivers used as water sources by rural dwellers inam et al 2015 in african and latin american countries the inability to report the presence of many persistent and emerging chemical pollutants pops ecps may be due to the lack of advanced analytical instruments such as chromatographic and mass spectrometry equipment suitable for the analysis of trace contaminants in multi contaminated environmental matrices sanganyado 2021 adeola et al 2022a 2022b aravind kumar et al 2022 several factors influence the fate distribution and ecotoxicology of chemical pollutants in aquatic systems however factors such as discharge mechanism and the physicochemical property of the chemical pollutant seem to play a dominant role aquatic pollution could result from a point source where contaminants originate from a single discharge point while nonpoint source contamination is also possible where pollutants enter the environment through diffuse sources such as runoffs atmospheric deposition rainfall leachates eroded dump sites vehicular emission etc sanganyado 2021 while point source pollution can be easily regulated and remediated via proper waste management strategies it is more tedious to manage nonpoint source pollution malkoske et al 2016 the number of chemical industries is expected to double by 2030 in comparison to 2017 unep 2019 hence there is a need for public sensitization on the ecological and health risks of synthetic chemicals and the need for advancement in waste management and pollution mitigation 3 green synthesis of carbon based adsorbents the adoption of eco friendly synthetic routes has been a burning topic in material development for environmental applications essentially to avoid the generation of harmful secondary pollutants the cost associated with the management of toxic chemicals wastes and existing shortcomings in waste management abdel shafy and mansour 2018 hao et al 2021 synthetic methods that reduce the exploitation of non renewable resources and conversion of waste material to useful adsorbents can be regarded as a greener approach taha et al 2020 premised on these principles carbon based adsorbents as presented in fig 1 are advantageous as they are often retrievable regenerable reusable and eco friendly mudhoo et al 2019 ahmed et al 2020 gopinath et al 2020 therefore this section provides an overview of the green synthetic methods employed for the preparation of the widely utilized carbon based adsorbents more so these methods and materials have also found global scientific applications 3 1 activated carbon and biochar activated carbon biosorbents and biochars are generated from carbon rich materials which include agricultural wastes biomass wood carbohydrates starch sludge etc fig 2 abatan et al 2019 qiu et al 2021 while biochar is synthesized via facile protocols involving raw material preparation size reduction pelletizing crushing and carbonization the activation process of biochar result in the formation of activated carbon jjagwe et al 2021 the carbonization of wet raw materials using an energy efficient technique 180 250 c called hydrothermal carbonization produces a type of biochar called hydrochar the surface functionalities such as oxygen and hydrogen containing acidic groups of the raw material remain fairly unchanged in hydrochars and this enhances adsorption performance against polar and ionic pollutants in water sabzehmeidani et al 2021 char is also produced as a by product through a thermochemical process known as gasification it involves the conversion of substances like biomass into syngas tar and char in the presence of a gasifying agent benedetti et al 2018 research into its use as an adsorbent is still in the developmental phase but reports show that it holds great potential in wastewater treatment jung et al 2019 liang et al 2021a similarly microwave irradiation is another way of preparing porous carbon materials because it is known to be a fast energy saving method that excludes interaction with the substance baytar et al 2018 activated carbon produced using this method has various advantages which include its shorter production time quicker cooling superior surface area and pore size and overall quality kumar et al 2020a biochar formed at low heating temperatures of 200 300 c through the torrefaction treatment process has continued to generate interest for their adsorption performance liang et al 2021a hu et al 2022 the biochar produced from this process under atmospheric pressure is said to have high oxygen rich functioning groups which aid efficient adsorption of heavy metals ions shen et al 2021 carbon can be activated thermally or chemically to produce activated carbon the concept of activation is to develop a porous carbonaceous material with a high surface area and this can be by gasification with the aid of oxidizing gas co2 or steam at a temperature between 800 and 1000 c thermal physical activation or chemically via the acid treatment with the aid of sulfuric or phosphoric acid at a temperature of 500 c tounsadi et al 2016 rahman et al 2019 the nature of raw material pollutant of interest and certain physicochemical properties such as specific surface area ssa pore size volume and distribution and the presence of surface functional moieties generally influences the method adopted for the synthesis of activated carbon and biochars menya et al 2020 recently an interesting porous carbon based material called cafe was prepared from coffee residues chen et al 2022 the coffee residues were dried carbonized in a tube furnace at 673 k amended with 1 1 koh and heated further at 1073 k under a constant stream of n2 gas the resultant cafe was acidified washed and dried in an oven a composite was also generated from café via plasma induced grafting with o phosphorylethanolamine o pea to form cafe o pea which was used for pollutant removal chen et al 2022 although the synthesis of biochar and activated carbon does not require extensive use of chemicals carrying out the carbonization process can result in the release of gaseous toxicants such as pahs pathak et al 2022 therefore a greener approach to carbonization has been developed which involved closed systems such as chemical vapor deposition cvd instruments mugadza et al 2019 waste valorization towards generating useful materials without extensive use of chemicals supports sustainable chemistry and presents a greener approach to waste management globally 3 2 graphene and carbon nanotubes cnt graphene and carbon nanotubes have been identified to have interesting physicochemical properties which are responsible for their various applications in biomedicine polymer composites biosensors and as adsorbents lee et al 2019 in recent years there have been various reports discussing the synthesis and properties of graphene coroş et al 2019 lin et al 2019 they have a large surface area high porosity and functional groups to aid their application in wastewater treatment hiew et al 2018 graphene can be prepared via a top down or bottom up approach the top down approach involves the delamination of graphite or graphitic compounds while the bottom up approach involves the growth assemblage of graphene from gaseous hydrocarbon or smaller units mbayachi et al 2021 most top down methods involve reduction and exfoliation processes while bottom up schemes include pyrolysis chemical vapor deposition and epitaxial growth schoonraad et al 2020 baig et al 2021 the reduction process involves the use of hydrazine monohydrate hydroquinone and sodium borohydride which are hazardous to humans and the environment they present inhalation risks and corrosive tendencies therefore an exodus towards more cost effective less hazardous and environmentally friendly plant based solutions is being investigated olorunkosebi et al 2021 several plants such as neem azadirachta indica pumpkin telfairia occidentalis rooibos aspalathus linearis sunflower helianthus annuus l sorghum sorghum bicolor l hibiscus flower hibiscus subdariffa etc have been reported by african researchers to contain reducing agents such as flavonoid tannin alkaloid amino acid and vitamin c suitable for the synthesis of graphene and composites fig 3 khenfouch et al 2016 ismail et al 2017 carbon nanomaterials especially carbon nanotubes have garnered wide environmental attention due to their peculiar characteristics of high surface area non corrosive property high stability and surface chemistry xu et al 2018 they are synthesized through various methods which include arc evaporation methods electrolysis flame synthesis laser ablation and chemical vapor deposition mashkoor et al 2020 they derive most of their properties from graphene as they have a structure similar to graphene sheets rolled into a tube gupta et al 2019 4 synthesis of various photocatalysts there is a significant number of techniques available for the synthesis of photocatalyst and they include solvothermal hydrothermal microwave one pot synthesis chemical vapor deposition etc the methods play a key role in the physical properties i e physical properties shape size and photochemical properties of the photocatalyst 4 1 sol gel method the sol gel method is a wet chemical technique it is the most widely used method for the synthesis of semiconductor photocatalyst the method is beneficial for tuning metal oxide to fit specific particular applications because many operational variables like ph temperature time of reaction the concentration of reagents nature of the catalyst and amount of water added can be regulated medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b this process involves several steps as shown in fig 4 the formation of sol from homogeneously mixed solution converting the solution into a gel by poly condensation process and heating of the product to get a different desired final product levy and zayat 2015 thiagarajan et al 2017 the final products like crystalline and non crystalline materials nanoparticles ceramics aerosols xerosols are dependent on the final heat treatment step the precursor sol can be deposited on a substrate by spin coating technique the gel formed after condensation processes is used to develop materials like nanoparticles ceramics aerogels and xerogels when further treatment steps occur jamjoum et al 2021 nanoparticles and xerogels can be obtained by evaporation of the solvent the obtained xerogels can be treated with heat to form ceramic and their greasy nature can be induced by melting techniques medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b thiagarajan et al 2017 some of the many advantages of the sol gel method are the method is cheap dopants can be incorporated into the solution at some stage of the process and it allows the fine control of the final product s chemical composition fornasiero and cargnello 2017 yilmaz and soylak 2020 gombac and his co workers described co doping of tio2 with boron and nitrogen by the sol gel method to obtain b n tio2 which has been used for the degradation of methyl orange mo an anionic dye the result indicated that the b and n doping enhanced the performance towards mo degradation with the k1 1 24 10 2 and k2 3 03 10 2 min almost two times the value of k1 gombac et al 2007 bui and his co workers synthesized mgac fe2o3 tio2 hybrid nanocomposite via sol gel for the removal of methylene blue and phenol in water using different ratios of the precursor mgac fe2o3 and tio2 the mgac fe2o3 005 g tio2 showed the best photocatalytic and photo fenton activities leading to the removal of 95 mb photo fenton reaction and 80 phenol photocatalytic reaction after 20 and 80 min respectively bui et al 2019 coupled heterojunction semiconductor oxides have been reported severally over the years to be prepared by sol gel method zno go p n heterojunction bayode et al 2020 fe2o3 go bayode et al 2021a zno cuo gajendiran and rajendran 2014 nb2o5 tio2 arbuj et al 2013a ta2o5 tio2 arbuj et al 2013b sno2 tio2 nur et al 2007 for the synthesis precursors of the metal oxides were hydrolyzed together under stirring allowing the formation of the coupled oxides the surface area of the synthesized coupled metal oxide using the sol gel method enhances the surface area of the product which improves the photocatalytic activities of the metal oxide medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b 4 2 hydrothermal method this method is one of the most popular used for the synthesis of nanomaterials medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b gan et al 2020 it refers to heterogeneous reactions under high pressure and temperature conditions in the presence of solvents making it a solution reaction based approach the formation of the nanomaterials can occur at any temperature ranging from a very high temperature to room temperature this method is usually conducted in a closed reaction chamber called an autoclave with or without the teflon lining lee et al 2012 fig 5 shows a schematic representation of the general steps of the hydrothermal process the autoclave creates a high temperature and pressure reaction environment by heating and pressuring the reaction system yang and park 2019 gan et al 2020 tio2 nanorods have been synthesized with the hydrothermal method muduli et al 2011 this method has been employed over the years for the synthesis of simple oxides yang and park 2019 such as cuo outokesh et al 2011 prathap et al 2012 zno liu and zeng 2003 gerbreders et al 2020 mno2 subramanian et al 2005 chu et al 2017 tio2 gao et al 2015 etc abdelraheem et al 2019 synthesized nitrogen and boron co doped tio2 nanoparticles to degrade bisphenol a using the hydrothermal method and a similar structure of one dimensional tio2 bi2wo6 hollow superstructures was synthesized to degrade rhodamine blue rhb it showed high photocatalytic activity over different cycles hou et al 2014 abdelraheem et al 2019 perera et al carried out the hydrothermal synthesis of graphene tio2 nanotube composite perera et al 2012 4 3 sonochemical method this method utilizes the sonochemistry principle making molecules undergo chemical reactions upon applying ultrasonic radiation ranging from 20 khz to 10 mhz ramirez corredores 2017 ghaedi 2021 it is now well recognized as a technique for the fabrication of nanomaterials gedanken and perelshtein 2015 ghaedi 2021 the chemical and physical effect of the ultrasound stems from a physical phenomenon known as acoustic cavitation xu et al 2013 this phenomenon leads to the formation growth and implosive collapse of the bubbles formed in liquid the collapse leads to intense local heat of approximately 500 k xu et al 2013 vabbina et al 2014 gedanken and perelshtein 2015 this process is considered to be environmentally benign and economical the shape and size of nanomaterials can be controlled using this method abbas et al 2014 ali dheyab et al 2021 the sonochemical method has been employed to synthesize nanometals carbides oxides semiconductors carbons metallic alloys etc xu et al 2013 medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b one of the main mechanisms behind the sonochemical methods is the generation rate of oh as confirmed by weissler 1959 through detecting the recombination of h2o2 weissler 1950 1959 hodnett 2015 the combination of the free radicals ḣ and oḣ produced during the sonochemical process combines with the strong oxidants h2 and h2o2 to facilitate the sonochemical process and remove the need to degrade the toxic reducing and oxidizing agents used the synthesis of cdo nanorods and cd oh 2 ag core satellite nanorods using the sonochemical method has been reported to be straightforward cost effective and eco friendly abbas et al 2014 the cd oh 2 ag core satellite nanorods were formed under thirty minutes of ultrasonication cdo nanorods in the presence of the ag precursor which led to phase transformation from the cubic structure of cdo to the monoclinic crystalline structure of cd oh 2 with ag nanodot deposited on the surface abbas et al 2014 other conventional methods like the hydrothermal method and chemical precipitation have been used successfully have been used for the synthesis of na2ti6o13 for the first time it was synthesized in a novel way using the sonochemical method fagundes et al 2019 bhatte and his co worker synthesized nano sized zinc oxide by sonochemical method the process involves using a precursor zinc acetate and a solvent 1 3 propanediol acting as the base stabilizer promoter and template for the nano sized zno synthesis bhatte et al 2012 4 4 chemical vapor deposition method cvd the chemical vapor deposition method is one of the extensively used material technology sun et al 2021 it involves the formation of thin film on the surface of a substrate by chemical reactions using gaseous compounds and substances containing film elements schoonraad et al 2020 xia 2021 cvd requires volatile molecular precursors as the source for film growth the precursor molecules are further transported in a carrier gas stream which may be chemically inert or reactive they are converted by chemical reactions in the gas phase near the surface to form intermediates reactants and by products that are gaseous or directly diffuse to the substrate through the boundary layer the reaction at the gas solid interface leads to the formation of a thin solid film of the desired material in cvd processes heated carrier gases drive the deposition reaction de macias 2005 medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b schoonraad et al 2020 sun et al 2021 the synthesis of nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes has been reported using ferrocene and aniline mixtures nxumalo et al 2008 the cvd method has been considered to grow graphene carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibre shah and tali 2016 ghaemi et al 2019 different researchers over the years have reported the synthesis of graphene using the cvd methods xu et al 2017 hsu et al 2018 moreno bárcenas et al 2018 yin et al 2018 it has also been reported for the synthesis of carbon nano horns sabarish kumar et al 2021 and carbon nanowalls wu et al 2002 synthesized carbon nanowall in a pecvd environment and it was reported as a surface bound material wu et al 2002 4 5 microwave method the microwave method has attracted attention as an efficient method for the synthesis of photocatalyst pan et al 2013 the electromagnetic radiation frequency of microwave ranges from 0 3 to 300 ghz corresponding to a wavelength range of 1 mm to 1 m this method has a lot of advantages such as less energy is required for synthesis increased yield cost efficient and it gives an edge over the sol gel and solvothermal method kitchen et al 2014 in the microwave method chemical reactions depend on the ability of the mixture to absorb microwave energy efficiently the component of the mixture might either disrupt or interact with the electromagnetic field velempini et al 2021 liu et al 2020 synthesized g c3n4 nano ribbon assembled seaweed like architecture which was reported to have a high surface area liu et al 2020 microwave synthesis of ag2s nanoparticles was reported by al shehri et al 2020 and the xrd characterization confirms the formation of monoclinic ag2s of space group p21 n and also indicates the crystalline nature of the photocatalyst al shehri et al 2020 the major disadvantage of the microwave method is that the metal oxide solely depends on the precursor 5 water treatment application of adsorbents and photocatalysts 5 1 mitigation of pops and ecps using adsorbents persistent organic pollutants pops are hazardous compounds that are recalcitrant to various forms of degradation and thereby remain in the environment for a long period aravind kumar et al 2022 dyes and pesticides are widely studied due to their occurrence in water bodies via several pathways which include textile wastewater and sewage effluent discharge rainfall irrigation induced leaching and erosion from agricultural farms etc akhtar et al 2021 they are regarded as carcinogenic and are associated with acute and chronic toxicities upon exposure in humans terrestrial animals and aquatic fauna srivatsav et al 2020 khalid et al 2017 emerging chemical pollutants ecps are compounds that are not routinely monitored parent compounds their metabolites and transformation products and may pose health threats to the environment adeola et al 2022b ecps include pharmaceuticals and personal care products pcpp illicit drugs gasoline additives siloxanes surfactants steroids and hormones flame retardants endocrine disrupting compounds perfluorinated compounds artificial sweeteners industrial additives archer et al 2017 patel et al 2019 the utilization of adsorbents for the treatment of wastewater and potable water has attracted significant attention for several decades mitigation of existing shortcomings such as the difficulty of regeneration low efficiencies sludge generation difficulty in adsorbent recovery etc are being addressed with smart solutions such as advances in composite material designs different materials with different textures structures and physiochemical are combined to produce composites using suitable and eco friendly synthetic routes and the resultant composites possess attributes of their constituents table 2 revealed that several agricultural wastes plant materials and specialized 2d carbon based materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have been utilized as adsorbents for the removal of these selected pops and ecps however as shown in table 2 activated carbon has the highest adsorption capacity for most target pollutants with regard to the studies presented these can be attributed to the large surface area and abundant binding sites pores and cavities for the removal of a wide range of organic pollutants abdel ghani et al 2015 the factors influencing the efficiency of the adsorbents for removal of dyes cationic anionic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pharmaceuticals and pesticides herbicides include contact time adsorbent dosage ph initial concentration temperature and molecular properties of the target compound ololade et al 2018 ore and adeola 2021 adeola and forbes 2021 pathak et al 2022 although biosorbent and activated carbon are regarded as less selective adsorbents because the pore distribution or surface morphology can barely be controlled or tuned unlike more specialized materials such as graphene carbon nanotubes and other 2d materials however biosorbent remains a suitable alternative adsorbent as they show great potential in eliminating persistent and emerging organic pollutants in polluted water and are readily available cheap and regenerable mugadza et al 2019 vishnu et al 2021 furthermore the separation and recovery of adsorbents for possible regeneration and reuse is an integral part of sustainability and cost reduction which is still a challenge in addition to the tuning of the physicochemical properties of the fabricated carbon for water treatment applications however the recovery of spent adsorbent can be achieved by incorporating magnetic properties in the fabrication of the adsorbent which facilitates easy separation of external magnetic field ahamad et al 2019 in summary it can be observed that there is wide variation between adsorption capacity for different materials used for various contaminants which can be attributed to variation in the physicochemical properties of both sorbents and sorbates however there is some degree of consistency in the dominant mechanism of interaction as pseudo second order kinetic models best described the adsorption kinetics and most contaminants were either adsorbed via monolayer adsorption langmuir or multilayer adsorption mechanism freundlich model 5 2 mitigation of organic chemical pollutants using photocatalysts organic chemical pollutants are currently a menace in the environment and water bodies due to globalization and industrialization bayode et al 2021a these pollutants are dangerous to aquatic lives and human health because they are carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic calling for their removal from water bodies meng et al 2016 zhu and zhou 2019 several methods have been explored and photocatalysis has proven to be one of the best methods for the degradation of these organic pollutants qiu et al 2021 this is due to their simplicity high efficiency rate destruction of toxic organic compounds without transferring the pollution from one phase to another reproducibility environmentally benign and easy handling soltani et al 2014 sudhaik et al 2018 hao et al 2021 bayode et al 2021a the backbone of the photocatalysis technique is the photocatalyst which drives the operation 5 2 1 photocatalytic degradation process and mode of action mechanism the photocatalysis technique is based on the reaction between organic pollutants and powerful oxidizing and reducing agents h and e generated by the light irradiation uv or visible on the surface of photocatalysts hasija et al 2019 2021 qiu et al 2021 the photocatalytic processes mainly use semiconductors catalysts such as cuo sno2 tio2 fe2o3 fe3o4 wo4 zno under light exposure uv visible or solar light to degrade the organic and inorganic contaminants kuriakose et al 2015 mohamed et al 2019 upon light irradiation the photocatalyst becomes activated forming electron hole pairs e h by migrating photogenerated electrons from the valence band to the conduction band raizada et al 2017 sharma et al 2019 zhu and zhou 2019 sharma et al 2021b raizada et al 2017 the electron hole pair generated after the initial excitation of the electron imitate reduction at the surface of the photocatalyst by the photogenerated electron e and oxidation at the surface of the photocatalyst by the photogenerated hole h and the generation of heat by recombination of the electron hole pairs at the surface of the photocatalyst reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 radicals are formed when the donor molecule is oxidized by the photogenerated holes present in the valence band vb and react with the water molecules to produce hydroxyl radical oh while the reaction between electrons from the conduction band and the dissolved oxygen specie form superoxide ion the electron induces redox reactions the h vb and e cb are powerful oxidizing and reducing agents respectively the photogenerated holes in the valence band react with organic compounds which results in their oxidation and mineralization with co2 and water as the end product the hvb can also react with water to generate hydroxyl radicals to oxidize organic chemical pollutants a general summary of possible reactions

as shown in fig 7 these organic contaminants differ from one another and some are present at trace levels 5 2 2 1 dyes a wide range of commercially available dyes is essential in most industrial processes as coloring agents for different products from food cosmetics pulp mills leather and plastic paint to textile seow and lim 2016 bayode et al 2020 most dyes are water soluble not readily biodegradable and potentially harmful to the ecosystem such as congo red cr rhodamine b rhb methyl orange mo and methylene blue mb victoria blue rose bengal alizarine green carmine red 120 eriochrome malachite green etc over the years different photocatalysts have been explored to degrade dyes in water li et al 2021a 2021b prakash et al 2016 explored the photocatalytic activity of sno2

that 99 9 of the dye was degraded in 60 min it was also confirmed that the doping of the zno with sn influenced the photodegradation of the dye bhatia et al 2017 alansi et al 2018 reported using 50 mg of g biobr nanocomposite photocatalyst to degrade 100 ml 10 ppm rhodamine blue the result showed that the pristine biobr had 80 degradation and g biobr had 100 degradation after 60 min this indicates the doping of the biobr with graphene improved the photocatalytic ability due to its large surface area and ability to delay recombination it was also reported that oxidizing radicals such as h o2 and oh were formed during the process and they are capable of oxidizing the rhb dye to co2 and h2o alansi et al 2018 in yet another exciting study not using the common dyes like methyl orange methylene

reported by phan et al 2019 for the degradation of rhb it showed that lfo mms and lfo mms removed 88 and 61 9 and 96 6 rhb in 90 min the performance showed that the low degradation efficiency suggests that mms could not work as the photo fenton catalyst under visible light in contrast the binary combination of lfo mms worked better as a photo fenton catalyst under visible light phan et al 2019 in a natural life system simulated wastewater containing 100 ppm of rhb mo and mb respectively was degraded using bi2o2co3 and ag2co3 synthesized photocatalysts after 180 min under visible light

six polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs pcb 28 pcb 52 pcb 118 pcb 153 pcb 180 pcb 194 wang et al 2022b the degradation of the six pcbs was between 77 98 within 55 min and the kinetic followed the pseudo first order with the rate ranging between 2 7 10 2 to 6 5 10 2 min 1 it was reported that the oh radical played a major role in the degradation process wang et al 2022b went further to study the efficiency of the fe3o4 β cd g c3n4 on real life effluent and it was efficient with degradation of 69 89 the photocatalyst was stable after six degradation cycles the synergistic effect between the fe3o4 β cd and g c3n4 played a vital role in the efficiency of the photocatalyst as shown in fig 13 wang et al 2022b metals and metal oxides are widely for the preparation of photocatalysts used in water splitting co2 reduction clean energy production environmental remediation and other industrial processes however these metal based catalysts are expensive have poor durability are susceptible to poisoning deactivation and pose an environmental risk liu and dai 2016 therefore carbon based photocatalysts were explored as an efficient low cost metal free alternative that has shown great potential in catalytic processes and proffers solutions to some of the limitations of metal based catalysts the synthesis of g c3n4 goaded z scheme photocatalytic systems has proffer solutions to optical absorption deficiency and faster recombination the selection of suitable supporting semiconductor material for g c3n4 which possesses a strong visible light response high stability and oxidation potential can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity kumar et al 2020b bankole et al 2022 potentially g c3n4 based z scheme photocatalyst can significantly enhance processes required for decontamination of pollutants as well as air clean up water splitting nitrogen fixation and co2 reduction kumar et al 2020b 2021 bankole et al 2022 however the practical application of g c3n4 is still limited due to the need for appropriate semiconductor material as an anchor insufficient visible light absorption and low quantum yield generally the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the materials discussed in this review varied between 81 and 100 and most photocatalysts performed best at acidic ph between 3 and 7 table 3 the ph plays a vital role in the photocatalytic degradation of contaminants in an aqueous medium it influences the binding of pollutants to catalytic surface and dissociation from material affects the surface charge of catalysts which could lead to electrostatic attraction or repulsion and alters the oxidation potential of valance band and process variables it is also interesting to note that photocatalytic degradation yielded optimal performance between minutes and few hours 3 h or less 6 comparison between adsorption and photocatalytic remediation approaches the two different approaches adsorption and photocatalytic degradation for the removal of organic chemical contaminants in water are both efficient and fast photocatalytic degradation is an eco friendly approach as the photocatalysts are environmentally benign and it takes care of the shortcoming of adsorption which is the transfer of contaminant from one phase to another which results in the generation of secondary waste after the adsorption process prompting the major concern of disposal of the spent adsorbents zhao et al 2018 mashile et al 2022 the photocatalytic degradation remediation approach converts or destroys the organic chemical contaminant into less toxic harmful by products or completely mineralizes it to obtain co2 and water as end products the co2 can be trapped and used as a clean source of energy and the water can also undergo further reactions for oxygen and hydrogen evolution which gives this approach more edge over adsorption photocatalytic degradation has proven to be more efficient than adsorption by the complete removal of the organic chemical pollutant for sustainable engineering t materials utilized in wastewater treatment must have potential for reuse for adsorption processes desorption has been identified as a method for regeneration it is important to identify an elutant that is eco friendly and cost effective and one that will not damage the adsorbent material lata et al 2014 ahamad et al 2020b vakili et al 2019 listed desorption agents such as salts alkalis acids and chelating acids and concluded that acid eluents have the highest desorption efficiency for regeneration other techniques for regenerating spent adsorbents include chemical thermal and biological methods momina et al 2018 the reuse of the adsorbents over different cycles can result in the leaching of some of the organic chemical molecules that were not desorbed into the solution thereby reducing the efficiency of the adsorbent which is not the case for photocatalyst as the organic chemical molecule has been mineralized gusain et al 2019 various studies have reported the regeneration and reuse potential of photocatalysts over numerous cycles in the degradation of organic pollutants adenuga et al 2021 reported 79 degradation of tetracycline even after three cycles when using agcl bi24o31cl10 as a visible light photocatalyst similarly the recyclability of titanium dioxide p25 and titanium dioxide grafted β cyclodextrin p25 β cd used for the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid have been reported they report between 82 6 and 84 efficiency of the photocatalytic materials after five cycles of irradiation safa et al 2019 interestingly in most photocatalytic degradation adsorption plays a vital role as the contaminants are first adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst and the photodegradation takes place on the surface through the hole or the active species so many researchers have reported that adsorption enhances photodegradation as the surface area of the photocatalyst plays a big role in electron injection some studies have synthesized materials with adsorptive and photocatalytic potential chitin cl poly itaconic acid co acrylamide zirconium tungstate nanocomposite hydrogel was developed for the removal of sulphon black dye with 92 66 removal under adsorptional photocatalysis conditions sharma et al 2021a wei et al 2021 also established that the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue using ceo2 g c3n4 was enhanced by adsorption and that through photodegradation the adsorption sites on the photocatalyst were regenerated table 4 entails a further comparison between the two remediation techniques 7 water treatment challenges and prospects in developing countries most developing countries do not have extensive environmental monitoring programs for emerging chemical pollutants and lack strict legislative guidelines for several chemical wastes resulting in the inability to set the maximum permissible levels for several hazardous compounds in water bodies adeola and forbes 2022 therefore there is a need to carry out detailed risk assessments of several emerging chemical pollutants in water bodies and set permissible levels in terms of concentrations in effluents discharged into water bodies several adsorbents and photocatalysts described in this survey are still prototypes that have not undergone field applications while a handful has been applied on an industrial scale and proved efficient however there are drawbacks such as high operational cost fouling difficulty in regeneration long treatment time generation of a large amount of sludge or secondary pollutants etc adeola and forbes 2021 adeola et al 2022b bayode et al 2021a pathak et al 2022 there is an urgent need for the development of more efficient wastewater sewage and drinking water treatment methods in developing countries to reduce the risk and adverse effects of exposure to these pollutants the lack of advanced analytical facilities in most countries has constrained research and development efforts the synthesis of green nanomaterials and specialized materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have been limited to countries with research facilities that can purchase advanced equipment such as the cvd instrument used for eco friendly preparation of these adsorbents and photocatalysts therefore there is a need for more research funding through public private partnerships between government agencies and industries in both developing and developed countries towards improving existing water treatment strategies and preventing the destruction of our ecosystem more compact cost effective robust and efficient water treatment technologies such as membrane technology and integrated systems combination of two or more techniques hold great potential for pollution remediation without the extensive use of chemicals initial hype about photocatalytic treatment was based on outstanding performance under unrealistic lab settings that allowed treating small volumes of water with high energy intensive lamps major challenges were identified in real water matrices in which degradation kinetics had decelerated due to the presence of scavengers and competing species gauging the effectiveness of photocatalysts thus needs to occur in more realistic environments and consider the influence of natural organic matter and inorganic species further research to improve even optimize the photocatalyst performance in complex environments and large volumes as well as mimicking natural water in real world environments is also urgently needed understanding the effects of water matrices can aid in strategizing novel materials or at least identifying niche applications of photocatalytic processes considering the true scale of environmental pollution a prominent challenge to the translation of photocatalytic technology is the inability to design a reactor and the cost of manufacturing reactors that can treat large volumes of water e g lakes and reservoirs reactor design and techno economic evaluation remain an enormous challenge to the practicality of photocatalytic degradation of pollutants in real life water systems future studies should focus on the development of benchmark reactors and compare passive and active treatment technologies towards harnessing a promising photocatalytic treatment approach for organic pollutants 8 conclusion the occurrence of chemical pollutants in water bodies raises concern due to their bioaccumulation potential non target exposures and adverse health effects water reusability must be considered due to the increasing demand for clean water thus wastewater treatment plants should be improved to handle the fast growing environmental and economic demands for safe water in this article an extensive bibliometric analysis was carrried out on adsorption and photocatalysis as remediation strategies for organic pollutants in water the synthesis of various photocatalysts and carbon based adsorbents were briefly discussed furthermore the mechanism of degradation of different classes of pollutants was evaluated while considering the removal efficiencies and process variables for optimal performance the use of cheap and eco friendly carbon based adsorbents and semiconductor photocatalysts remains the most cost effective and widely utilized remedial approach to date with green photocatalysts and nanocomposites holding immense potential for future practical applications as shown in this review most studies focused mainly on single pollutant degradation or adsorption for future studies it will be beneficial to evaluate the adsorption and photocatalytic remediation of polluted water with multiple contaminants and establish the effect of natural organic matter on photocatalytic processes in real water samples also more robust efficient and eco friendly nano adsorbents and photocatalysts are required over the years ease of industrial application of carbon based materials for industrial municipal water treatment and operational cost of photoreactors has offered considerable limitations therefore emerging technologies must seek to surmount these challenges and proffer solutions more adaptable for large scale practical applications in developing countries of the world credit

1304,the provision of clean water is still a major challenge in developing parts of the world as emphasized by the united nation sustainable development goals sdg 6 and has remained a subject of extensive research globally advancements in science and industry have resulted in a massive surge in the amount of industrial chemicals produced within the last few decades persistent and emerging organic pollutants are detected in aquatic environments and conventional wastewater treatment plants have ineffectively handled these trace bioaccumulative and toxic compounds therefore we have conducted an extensive bibliometric analysis of different materials utilized to combat organic pollutants via adsorption and photocatalysis the classes of pollutants material synthesis mechanisms of interaction merits and challenges were comprehensively discussed the paper highlights the advantages of various materials used in the removal of hazardous pollutants from wastewater with activated carbon having the highest adsorption capacity dyes pharmaceuticals endocrine disrupting chemicals pesticides and other recalcitrant organic pollutants have been successfully removed at high degradation efficiencies through the photocatalytic process the photocatalytic degradation and adsorption processes were compared by considering factors such as cost efficiency ease of application and reusability this review will be good resource material for water treatment professionals scientists who may be interested in adsorptive and photocatalytic remediation of organic chemicals pollutants graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorbent photocatalyst carbon based material organic chemical pollutant water treatment 1 introduction the presence of chemical pollutants in water bodies has raised global concern emerging contaminants are various unregulated or newly regulated compounds and their transformation products with the potential to have adverse impacts on environmental and human health adeola et al 2022a 2022b tavengwa and dalu 2021 these contaminants include micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products surfactants biocides plasticizers dyes illicit drugs endocrine disruptors pesticides and herbicides sanganyado 2021 khan et al 2022a mashile et al 2022 it was reported that an estimated 350 000 chemicals are in use and an alarming amount of waste of roughly over 1 8 billion kg waste are released daily into aquatic bodies worldwide wang et al 2020 the estimated volume of wastewater generated annually is not less than six times the volume of global aquatic freshwater furthermore acute and chronic exposure to chemical pollutants has reportedly led to diverse toxicological effects for both humans and aquatic fauna even at trace concentrations ng l to μg l concentrations in fluids or ng kg to μg kg in solid matrices sanganyado 2021 the provision of clean water as emphasized by the united nation sustainable development goals un sdgs is still a major challenge especially in developing parts of the world unsdg 2018 therefore concerted and extensive efforts have been directed globally towards the development of suitable efficient and ecofriendly remediation strategies for persistent and emerging chemical pollutants various techniques have been employed in the removal of toxic compounds from wastewater including phytoremediation masinire et al 2021 advanced oxidation processes khan et al 2014 khan et al 2021a adsorption wang et al 2019 2022a adeola and forbes 2019 2020 membrane treatments laqbaqbi et al 2019 coagulation dotto et al 2019 biological treatment goswami et al 2018 khan et al 2022b some of these technologies have drawbacks such as high cost of operation complex operation and production of high quantity of sludge adeola and forbes 2021 iqbal et al 2022 mashile et al 2022 among such technologies adsorption and photocatalysis have received vast attention due to their potential for practical application with advantages such as low cost safety and reliability khan et al 2021b adsorption is regarded as a surface phenomenon where organic and inorganic compounds adhere to an adsorbent s surface via physical or and chemical attractive forces while photocatalytic degradation involves the use of a catalyst often a semiconductor to accelerate the chemical transformation of pollutants via ultraviolet or visible light radiation li et al 2021a 2021b bayode et al 2021a the concept of green chemistry includes a reduction in waste generation secondary pollutants safer chemical syntheses development of less hazardous products chemicals development of regenerable renewable materials ensuring degradability of products materials after use to prevent pollution etc anastas and eghbali 2010 wang et al 2022a it also involves the conversion of waste such as volcanic ashes and sludge based materials into value added materials like adsorbents for the removal of pollutants from the environment mu azu et al 2022 liadi et al 2021 adopting a green synthesis approach in the development of adsorbents and photocatalysts could break the vicious cycle of replacing hazardous substances with an equally toxic and bioaccumulative compound the decision to explore carbon based materials for water treatment was driven by the concept of sustainable chemistry and the need to address waste management challenges and the conversion of waste to wealth is a cost effective path to proper waste management malik et al 2015 vishnu et al 2021 therefore green chemistry techniques can be employed as a viable and eco friendly alternative for water purification this comprehensive review provides a status report on adsorbents and photocatalysts as combatants of chemical pollutants worldwide discussing various synthetic approaches applications merits limitations and drawing comparisons between both core techniques of environmental remediation the aquatic environment is interconnected globally thus water treatment challenges in developing countries and prospects were discussed the literature scope of this review is based on scopus and web of science published articles and books while the search keywords are adsorbents photocatalyst emerging chemical pollutants ecp persistent organic pollutants pop photocatalytic degradation adsorption and remediation 2 chemical pollutants as the enemy there is a massive surge in the amount of industrial chemicals produced within the last century between 1 and 400 million tons in the year 2000 unep 2019 furthermore the manufacturing capacity of industries globally improved from 1 2 billion tons to 2 3 billion tons between the years 2000 and 2017 sanganyado 2021 however this staggering increase in production capacity which is currently experienced in the fourth industrial revolution as a result of advancement in science has also resulted in emerging worrisome realities the world health organization who reported that chemical pollution resulted in 1 6 million deaths in 2018 worldwide das and horton 2018 naidu et al 2021 pharmaceuticals and personal care products such as antiretroviral drugs antidepressants anti cancer drugs antibiotics etc are detected in municipal hospital and industrial wastewater effluent adeola et al 2022b adeola and forbes 2022 battell et al 2022 they are toxic to the environment and human health even at low concentrations and are a result of discharge from urban and farm wastewater as well as partially treated water from pharmaceutical industries ihsanullah et al 2022 on the other hand pesticides and veterinary drugs are frequently detected in agriculture runoff and urban stormwater casado et al 2019 landfill leachate and industrial wastewater often convey indiscriminately released chemicals such as flame retardants dyes surfactants and toxic heavy metals gwenzi and chaukura 2018 ibigbami et al 2022 chemical pollutants are ubiquitous in aquatic systems due to various anthropogenic applications and the interconnected nature of various aquatic systems table 1 over 5000 drugs are in use currently and as many as 631 have been detected in freshwater aquatic systems in various parts of the world aus der beek et al 2016 the presence of different antimicrobial and antiviral drugs has been reported in several african and european aquatic systems funke et al 2016 kairigo et al 2020 sixty eight chemical pollutants including antimicrobial agents and pesticides that have never been detected in kenyan water bodies were reported in a recent study kandie et al 2020 in eastern nigeria toxic organic compounds with high risk quotients such as bisphenol a erythromycin chloramphenicol triclosan and triclocarban were found in rivers used as water sources by rural dwellers inam et al 2015 in african and latin american countries the inability to report the presence of many persistent and emerging chemical pollutants pops ecps may be due to the lack of advanced analytical instruments such as chromatographic and mass spectrometry equipment suitable for the analysis of trace contaminants in multi contaminated environmental matrices sanganyado 2021 adeola et al 2022a 2022b aravind kumar et al 2022 several factors influence the fate distribution and ecotoxicology of chemical pollutants in aquatic systems however factors such as discharge mechanism and the physicochemical property of the chemical pollutant seem to play a dominant role aquatic pollution could result from a point source where contaminants originate from a single discharge point while nonpoint source contamination is also possible where pollutants enter the environment through diffuse sources such as runoffs atmospheric deposition rainfall leachates eroded dump sites vehicular emission etc sanganyado 2021 while point source pollution can be easily regulated and remediated via proper waste management strategies it is more tedious to manage nonpoint source pollution malkoske et al 2016 the number of chemical industries is expected to double by 2030 in comparison to 2017 unep 2019 hence there is a need for public sensitization on the ecological and health risks of synthetic chemicals and the need for advancement in waste management and pollution mitigation 3 green synthesis of carbon based adsorbents the adoption of eco friendly synthetic routes has been a burning topic in material development for environmental applications essentially to avoid the generation of harmful secondary pollutants the cost associated with the management of toxic chemicals wastes and existing shortcomings in waste management abdel shafy and mansour 2018 hao et al 2021 synthetic methods that reduce the exploitation of non renewable resources and conversion of waste material to useful adsorbents can be regarded as a greener approach taha et al 2020 premised on these principles carbon based adsorbents as presented in fig 1 are advantageous as they are often retrievable regenerable reusable and eco friendly mudhoo et al 2019 ahmed et al 2020 gopinath et al 2020 therefore this section provides an overview of the green synthetic methods employed for the preparation of the widely utilized carbon based adsorbents more so these methods and materials have also found global scientific applications 3 1 activated carbon and biochar activated carbon biosorbents and biochars are generated from carbon rich materials which include agricultural wastes biomass wood carbohydrates starch sludge etc fig 2 abatan et al 2019 qiu et al 2021 while biochar is synthesized via facile protocols involving raw material preparation size reduction pelletizing crushing and carbonization the activation process of biochar result in the formation of activated carbon jjagwe et al 2021 the carbonization of wet raw materials using an energy efficient technique 180 250 c called hydrothermal carbonization produces a type of biochar called hydrochar the surface functionalities such as oxygen and hydrogen containing acidic groups of the raw material remain fairly unchanged in hydrochars and this enhances adsorption performance against polar and ionic pollutants in water sabzehmeidani et al 2021 char is also produced as a by product through a thermochemical process known as gasification it involves the conversion of substances like biomass into syngas tar and char in the presence of a gasifying agent benedetti et al 2018 research into its use as an adsorbent is still in the developmental phase but reports show that it holds great potential in wastewater treatment jung et al 2019 liang et al 2021a similarly microwave irradiation is another way of preparing porous carbon materials because it is known to be a fast energy saving method that excludes interaction with the substance baytar et al 2018 activated carbon produced using this method has various advantages which include its shorter production time quicker cooling superior surface area and pore size and overall quality kumar et al 2020a biochar formed at low heating temperatures of 200 300 c through the torrefaction treatment process has continued to generate interest for their adsorption performance liang et al 2021a hu et al 2022 the biochar produced from this process under atmospheric pressure is said to have high oxygen rich functioning groups which aid efficient adsorption of heavy metals ions shen et al 2021 carbon can be activated thermally or chemically to produce activated carbon the concept of activation is to develop a porous carbonaceous material with a high surface area and this can be by gasification with the aid of oxidizing gas co2 or steam at a temperature between 800 and 1000 c thermal physical activation or chemically via the acid treatment with the aid of sulfuric or phosphoric acid at a temperature of 500 c tounsadi et al 2016 rahman et al 2019 the nature of raw material pollutant of interest and certain physicochemical properties such as specific surface area ssa pore size volume and distribution and the presence of surface functional moieties generally influences the method adopted for the synthesis of activated carbon and biochars menya et al 2020 recently an interesting porous carbon based material called cafe was prepared from coffee residues chen et al 2022 the coffee residues were dried carbonized in a tube furnace at 673 k amended with 1 1 koh and heated further at 1073 k under a constant stream of n2 gas the resultant cafe was acidified washed and dried in an oven a composite was also generated from café via plasma induced grafting with o phosphorylethanolamine o pea to form cafe o pea which was used for pollutant removal chen et al 2022 although the synthesis of biochar and activated carbon does not require extensive use of chemicals carrying out the carbonization process can result in the release of gaseous toxicants such as pahs pathak et al 2022 therefore a greener approach to carbonization has been developed which involved closed systems such as chemical vapor deposition cvd instruments mugadza et al 2019 waste valorization towards generating useful materials without extensive use of chemicals supports sustainable chemistry and presents a greener approach to waste management globally 3 2 graphene and carbon nanotubes cnt graphene and carbon nanotubes have been identified to have interesting physicochemical properties which are responsible for their various applications in biomedicine polymer composites biosensors and as adsorbents lee et al 2019 in recent years there have been various reports discussing the synthesis and properties of graphene coroş et al 2019 lin et al 2019 they have a large surface area high porosity and functional groups to aid their application in wastewater treatment hiew et al 2018 graphene can be prepared via a top down or bottom up approach the top down approach involves the delamination of graphite or graphitic compounds while the bottom up approach involves the growth assemblage of graphene from gaseous hydrocarbon or smaller units mbayachi et al 2021 most top down methods involve reduction and exfoliation processes while bottom up schemes include pyrolysis chemical vapor deposition and epitaxial growth schoonraad et al 2020 baig et al 2021 the reduction process involves the use of hydrazine monohydrate hydroquinone and sodium borohydride which are hazardous to humans and the environment they present inhalation risks and corrosive tendencies therefore an exodus towards more cost effective less hazardous and environmentally friendly plant based solutions is being investigated olorunkosebi et al 2021 several plants such as neem azadirachta indica pumpkin telfairia occidentalis rooibos aspalathus linearis sunflower helianthus annuus l sorghum sorghum bicolor l hibiscus flower hibiscus subdariffa etc have been reported by african researchers to contain reducing agents such as flavonoid tannin alkaloid amino acid and vitamin c suitable for the synthesis of graphene and composites fig 3 khenfouch et al 2016 ismail et al 2017 carbon nanomaterials especially carbon nanotubes have garnered wide environmental attention due to their peculiar characteristics of high surface area non corrosive property high stability and surface chemistry xu et al 2018 they are synthesized through various methods which include arc evaporation methods electrolysis flame synthesis laser ablation and chemical vapor deposition mashkoor et al 2020 they derive most of their properties from graphene as they have a structure similar to graphene sheets rolled into a tube gupta et al 2019 4 synthesis of various photocatalysts there is a significant number of techniques available for the synthesis of photocatalyst and they include solvothermal hydrothermal microwave one pot synthesis chemical vapor deposition etc the methods play a key role in the physical properties i e physical properties shape size and photochemical properties of the photocatalyst 4 1 sol gel method the sol gel method is a wet chemical technique it is the most widely used method for the synthesis of semiconductor photocatalyst the method is beneficial for tuning metal oxide to fit specific particular applications because many operational variables like ph temperature time of reaction the concentration of reagents nature of the catalyst and amount of water added can be regulated medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b this process involves several steps as shown in fig 4 the formation of sol from homogeneously mixed solution converting the solution into a gel by poly condensation process and heating of the product to get a different desired final product levy and zayat 2015 thiagarajan et al 2017 the final products like crystalline and non crystalline materials nanoparticles ceramics aerosols xerosols are dependent on the final heat treatment step the precursor sol can be deposited on a substrate by spin coating technique the gel formed after condensation processes is used to develop materials like nanoparticles ceramics aerogels and xerogels when further treatment steps occur jamjoum et al 2021 nanoparticles and xerogels can be obtained by evaporation of the solvent the obtained xerogels can be treated with heat to form ceramic and their greasy nature can be induced by melting techniques medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b thiagarajan et al 2017 some of the many advantages of the sol gel method are the method is cheap dopants can be incorporated into the solution at some stage of the process and it allows the fine control of the final product s chemical composition fornasiero and cargnello 2017 yilmaz and soylak 2020 gombac and his co workers described co doping of tio2 with boron and nitrogen by the sol gel method to obtain b n tio2 which has been used for the degradation of methyl orange mo an anionic dye the result indicated that the b and n doping enhanced the performance towards mo degradation with the k1 1 24 10 2 and k2 3 03 10 2 min almost two times the value of k1 gombac et al 2007 bui and his co workers synthesized mgac fe2o3 tio2 hybrid nanocomposite via sol gel for the removal of methylene blue and phenol in water using different ratios of the precursor mgac fe2o3 and tio2 the mgac fe2o3 005 g tio2 showed the best photocatalytic and photo fenton activities leading to the removal of 95 mb photo fenton reaction and 80 phenol photocatalytic reaction after 20 and 80 min respectively bui et al 2019 coupled heterojunction semiconductor oxides have been reported severally over the years to be prepared by sol gel method zno go p n heterojunction bayode et al 2020 fe2o3 go bayode et al 2021a zno cuo gajendiran and rajendran 2014 nb2o5 tio2 arbuj et al 2013a ta2o5 tio2 arbuj et al 2013b sno2 tio2 nur et al 2007 for the synthesis precursors of the metal oxides were hydrolyzed together under stirring allowing the formation of the coupled oxides the surface area of the synthesized coupled metal oxide using the sol gel method enhances the surface area of the product which improves the photocatalytic activities of the metal oxide medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b 4 2 hydrothermal method this method is one of the most popular used for the synthesis of nanomaterials medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b gan et al 2020 it refers to heterogeneous reactions under high pressure and temperature conditions in the presence of solvents making it a solution reaction based approach the formation of the nanomaterials can occur at any temperature ranging from a very high temperature to room temperature this method is usually conducted in a closed reaction chamber called an autoclave with or without the teflon lining lee et al 2012 fig 5 shows a schematic representation of the general steps of the hydrothermal process the autoclave creates a high temperature and pressure reaction environment by heating and pressuring the reaction system yang and park 2019 gan et al 2020 tio2 nanorods have been synthesized with the hydrothermal method muduli et al 2011 this method has been employed over the years for the synthesis of simple oxides yang and park 2019 such as cuo outokesh et al 2011 prathap et al 2012 zno liu and zeng 2003 gerbreders et al 2020 mno2 subramanian et al 2005 chu et al 2017 tio2 gao et al 2015 etc abdelraheem et al 2019 synthesized nitrogen and boron co doped tio2 nanoparticles to degrade bisphenol a using the hydrothermal method and a similar structure of one dimensional tio2 bi2wo6 hollow superstructures was synthesized to degrade rhodamine blue rhb it showed high photocatalytic activity over different cycles hou et al 2014 abdelraheem et al 2019 perera et al carried out the hydrothermal synthesis of graphene tio2 nanotube composite perera et al 2012 4 3 sonochemical method this method utilizes the sonochemistry principle making molecules undergo chemical reactions upon applying ultrasonic radiation ranging from 20 khz to 10 mhz ramirez corredores 2017 ghaedi 2021 it is now well recognized as a technique for the fabrication of nanomaterials gedanken and perelshtein 2015 ghaedi 2021 the chemical and physical effect of the ultrasound stems from a physical phenomenon known as acoustic cavitation xu et al 2013 this phenomenon leads to the formation growth and implosive collapse of the bubbles formed in liquid the collapse leads to intense local heat of approximately 500 k xu et al 2013 vabbina et al 2014 gedanken and perelshtein 2015 this process is considered to be environmentally benign and economical the shape and size of nanomaterials can be controlled using this method abbas et al 2014 ali dheyab et al 2021 the sonochemical method has been employed to synthesize nanometals carbides oxides semiconductors carbons metallic alloys etc xu et al 2013 medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b one of the main mechanisms behind the sonochemical methods is the generation rate of oh as confirmed by weissler 1959 through detecting the recombination of h2o2 weissler 1950 1959 hodnett 2015 the combination of the free radicals ḣ and oḣ produced during the sonochemical process combines with the strong oxidants h2 and h2o2 to facilitate the sonochemical process and remove the need to degrade the toxic reducing and oxidizing agents used the synthesis of cdo nanorods and cd oh 2 ag core satellite nanorods using the sonochemical method has been reported to be straightforward cost effective and eco friendly abbas et al 2014 the cd oh 2 ag core satellite nanorods were formed under thirty minutes of ultrasonication cdo nanorods in the presence of the ag precursor which led to phase transformation from the cubic structure of cdo to the monoclinic crystalline structure of cd oh 2 with ag nanodot deposited on the surface abbas et al 2014 other conventional methods like the hydrothermal method and chemical precipitation have been used successfully have been used for the synthesis of na2ti6o13 for the first time it was synthesized in a novel way using the sonochemical method fagundes et al 2019 bhatte and his co worker synthesized nano sized zinc oxide by sonochemical method the process involves using a precursor zinc acetate and a solvent 1 3 propanediol acting as the base stabilizer promoter and template for the nano sized zno synthesis bhatte et al 2012 4 4 chemical vapor deposition method cvd the chemical vapor deposition method is one of the extensively used material technology sun et al 2021 it involves the formation of thin film on the surface of a substrate by chemical reactions using gaseous compounds and substances containing film elements schoonraad et al 2020 xia 2021 cvd requires volatile molecular precursors as the source for film growth the precursor molecules are further transported in a carrier gas stream which may be chemically inert or reactive they are converted by chemical reactions in the gas phase near the surface to form intermediates reactants and by products that are gaseous or directly diffuse to the substrate through the boundary layer the reaction at the gas solid interface leads to the formation of a thin solid film of the desired material in cvd processes heated carrier gases drive the deposition reaction de macias 2005 medina ramírez et al 2015a 2015b schoonraad et al 2020 sun et al 2021 the synthesis of nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes has been reported using ferrocene and aniline mixtures nxumalo et al 2008 the cvd method has been considered to grow graphene carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibre shah and tali 2016 ghaemi et al 2019 different researchers over the years have reported the synthesis of graphene using the cvd methods xu et al 2017 hsu et al 2018 moreno bárcenas et al 2018 yin et al 2018 it has also been reported for the synthesis of carbon nano horns sabarish kumar et al 2021 and carbon nanowalls wu et al 2002 synthesized carbon nanowall in a pecvd environment and it was reported as a surface bound material wu et al 2002 4 5 microwave method the microwave method has attracted attention as an efficient method for the synthesis of photocatalyst pan et al 2013 the electromagnetic radiation frequency of microwave ranges from 0 3 to 300 ghz corresponding to a wavelength range of 1 mm to 1 m this method has a lot of advantages such as less energy is required for synthesis increased yield cost efficient and it gives an edge over the sol gel and solvothermal method kitchen et al 2014 in the microwave method chemical reactions depend on the ability of the mixture to absorb microwave energy efficiently the component of the mixture might either disrupt or interact with the electromagnetic field velempini et al 2021 liu et al 2020 synthesized g c3n4 nano ribbon assembled seaweed like architecture which was reported to have a high surface area liu et al 2020 microwave synthesis of ag2s nanoparticles was reported by al shehri et al 2020 and the xrd characterization confirms the formation of monoclinic ag2s of space group p21 n and also indicates the crystalline nature of the photocatalyst al shehri et al 2020 the major disadvantage of the microwave method is that the metal oxide solely depends on the precursor 5 water treatment application of adsorbents and photocatalysts 5 1 mitigation of pops and ecps using adsorbents persistent organic pollutants pops are hazardous compounds that are recalcitrant to various forms of degradation and thereby remain in the environment for a long period aravind kumar et al 2022 dyes and pesticides are widely studied due to their occurrence in water bodies via several pathways which include textile wastewater and sewage effluent discharge rainfall irrigation induced leaching and erosion from agricultural farms etc akhtar et al 2021 they are regarded as carcinogenic and are associated with acute and chronic toxicities upon exposure in humans terrestrial animals and aquatic fauna srivatsav et al 2020 khalid et al 2017 emerging chemical pollutants ecps are compounds that are not routinely monitored parent compounds their metabolites and transformation products and may pose health threats to the environment adeola et al 2022b ecps include pharmaceuticals and personal care products pcpp illicit drugs gasoline additives siloxanes surfactants steroids and hormones flame retardants endocrine disrupting compounds perfluorinated compounds artificial sweeteners industrial additives archer et al 2017 patel et al 2019 the utilization of adsorbents for the treatment of wastewater and potable water has attracted significant attention for several decades mitigation of existing shortcomings such as the difficulty of regeneration low efficiencies sludge generation difficulty in adsorbent recovery etc are being addressed with smart solutions such as advances in composite material designs different materials with different textures structures and physiochemical are combined to produce composites using suitable and eco friendly synthetic routes and the resultant composites possess attributes of their constituents table 2 revealed that several agricultural wastes plant materials and specialized 2d carbon based materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have been utilized as adsorbents for the removal of these selected pops and ecps however as shown in table 2 activated carbon has the highest adsorption capacity for most target pollutants with regard to the studies presented these can be attributed to the large surface area and abundant binding sites pores and cavities for the removal of a wide range of organic pollutants abdel ghani et al 2015 the factors influencing the efficiency of the adsorbents for removal of dyes cationic anionic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pharmaceuticals and pesticides herbicides include contact time adsorbent dosage ph initial concentration temperature and molecular properties of the target compound ololade et al 2018 ore and adeola 2021 adeola and forbes 2021 pathak et al 2022 although biosorbent and activated carbon are regarded as less selective adsorbents because the pore distribution or surface morphology can barely be controlled or tuned unlike more specialized materials such as graphene carbon nanotubes and other 2d materials however biosorbent remains a suitable alternative adsorbent as they show great potential in eliminating persistent and emerging organic pollutants in polluted water and are readily available cheap and regenerable mugadza et al 2019 vishnu et al 2021 furthermore the separation and recovery of adsorbents for possible regeneration and reuse is an integral part of sustainability and cost reduction which is still a challenge in addition to the tuning of the physicochemical properties of the fabricated carbon for water treatment applications however the recovery of spent adsorbent can be achieved by incorporating magnetic properties in the fabrication of the adsorbent which facilitates easy separation of external magnetic field ahamad et al 2019 in summary it can be observed that there is wide variation between adsorption capacity for different materials used for various contaminants which can be attributed to variation in the physicochemical properties of both sorbents and sorbates however there is some degree of consistency in the dominant mechanism of interaction as pseudo second order kinetic models best described the adsorption kinetics and most contaminants were either adsorbed via monolayer adsorption langmuir or multilayer adsorption mechanism freundlich model 5 2 mitigation of organic chemical pollutants using photocatalysts organic chemical pollutants are currently a menace in the environment and water bodies due to globalization and industrialization bayode et al 2021a these pollutants are dangerous to aquatic lives and human health because they are carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic calling for their removal from water bodies meng et al 2016 zhu and zhou 2019 several methods have been explored and photocatalysis has proven to be one of the best methods for the degradation of these organic pollutants qiu et al 2021 this is due to their simplicity high efficiency rate destruction of toxic organic compounds without transferring the pollution from one phase to another reproducibility environmentally benign and easy handling soltani et al 2014 sudhaik et al 2018 hao et al 2021 bayode et al 2021a the backbone of the photocatalysis technique is the photocatalyst which drives the operation 5 2 1 photocatalytic degradation process and mode of action mechanism the photocatalysis technique is based on the reaction between organic pollutants and powerful oxidizing and reducing agents h and e generated by the light irradiation uv or visible on the surface of photocatalysts hasija et al 2019 2021 qiu et al 2021 the photocatalytic processes mainly use semiconductors catalysts such as cuo sno2 tio2 fe2o3 fe3o4 wo4 zno under light exposure uv visible or solar light to degrade the organic and inorganic contaminants kuriakose et al 2015 mohamed et al 2019 upon light irradiation the photocatalyst becomes activated forming electron hole pairs e h by migrating photogenerated electrons from the valence band to the conduction band raizada et al 2017 sharma et al 2019 zhu and zhou 2019 sharma et al 2021b raizada et al 2017 the electron hole pair generated after the initial excitation of the electron imitate reduction at the surface of the photocatalyst by the photogenerated electron e and oxidation at the surface of the photocatalyst by the photogenerated hole h and the generation of heat by recombination of the electron hole pairs at the surface of the photocatalyst reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl oh and superoxide o2 radicals are formed when the donor molecule is oxidized by the photogenerated holes present in the valence band vb and react with the water molecules to produce hydroxyl radical oh while the reaction between electrons from the conduction band and the dissolved oxygen specie form superoxide ion the electron induces redox reactions the h vb and e cb are powerful oxidizing and reducing agents respectively the photogenerated holes in the valence band react with organic compounds which results in their oxidation and mineralization with co2 and water as the end product the hvb can also react with water to generate hydroxyl radicals to oxidize organic chemical pollutants a general summary of possible reactions

as shown in fig 7 these organic contaminants differ from one another and some are present at trace levels 5 2 2 1 dyes a wide range of commercially available dyes is essential in most industrial processes as coloring agents for different products from food cosmetics pulp mills leather and plastic paint to textile seow and lim 2016 bayode et al 2020 most dyes are water soluble not readily biodegradable and potentially harmful to the ecosystem such as congo red cr rhodamine b rhb methyl orange mo and methylene blue mb victoria blue rose bengal alizarine green carmine red 120 eriochrome malachite green etc over the years different photocatalysts have been explored to degrade dyes in water li et al 2021a 2021b prakash et al 2016 explored the photocatalytic activity of sno2

of g biobr nanocomposite photocatalyst to degrade 100 ml 10 ppm rhodamine blue the result showed that the pristine biobr had 80 degradation and g biobr had 100 degradation after 60 min this indicates the doping of the biobr with graphene improved the photocatalytic ability due to its large surface area and ability to delay recombination it was also reported that oxidizing radicals such as h o2 and oh were formed during the process and they are capable of oxidizing the rhb dye to co2 and h2o alansi et al 2018 in yet another exciting study not using the common dyes like methyl orange methylene

reported by phan et al 2019 for the degradation of rhb it showed that lfo mms and lfo mms removed 88 and 61 9 and 96 6 rhb in 90 min the performance showed that the low degradation efficiency suggests that mms could not work as the photo fenton catalyst under visible light in contrast the binary combination of lfo mms worked better as a photo fenton catalyst under visible light phan et al 2019 in a natural life system simulated wastewater containing 100 ppm of rhb mo and mb respectively was degraded using bi2o2co3 and ag2co3 synthesized photocatalysts after 180 min under visible light

six polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs pcb 28 pcb 52 pcb 118 pcb 153 pcb 180 pcb 194 wang et al 2022b the degradation of the six pcbs was between 77 98 within 55 min and the kinetic followed the pseudo first order with the rate ranging between 2 7 10 2 to 6 5 10 2 min 1 it was reported that the oh radical played a major role in the degradation process wang et al 2022b went further to study the efficiency of the fe3o4 β cd g c3n4 on real life effluent and it was efficient with degradation of 69 89 the photocatalyst was stable after six degradation cycles the synergistic effect between the fe3o4 β cd and g c3n4 played a vital role in the efficiency of the photocatalyst as shown in fig 13 wang et al 2022b metals and metal oxides are widely for the preparation of photocatalysts used in water splitting co2 reduction clean energy production environmental remediation and other industrial processes however these metal based catalysts are expensive have poor durability are susceptible to poisoning deactivation and pose an environmental risk liu and dai 2016 therefore carbon based photocatalysts were explored as an efficient low cost metal free alternative that has shown great potential in catalytic processes and proffers solutions to some of the limitations of metal based catalysts the synthesis of g c3n4 goaded z scheme photocatalytic systems has proffer solutions to optical absorption deficiency and faster recombination the selection of suitable supporting semiconductor material for g c3n4 which possesses a strong visible light response high stability and oxidation potential can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity kumar et al 2020b bankole et al 2022 potentially g c3n4 based z scheme photocatalyst can significantly enhance processes required for decontamination of pollutants as well as air clean up water splitting nitrogen fixation and co2 reduction kumar et al 2020b 2021 bankole et al 2022 however the practical application of g c3n4 is still limited due to the need for appropriate semiconductor material as an anchor insufficient visible light absorption and low quantum yield generally the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the materials discussed in this review varied between 81 and 100 and most photocatalysts performed best at acidic ph between 3 and 7 table 3 the ph plays a vital role in the photocatalytic degradation of contaminants in an aqueous medium it influences the binding of pollutants to catalytic surface and dissociation from material affects the surface charge of catalysts which could lead to electrostatic attraction or repulsion and alters the oxidation potential of valance band and process variables it is also interesting to note that photocatalytic degradation yielded optimal performance between minutes and few hours 3 h or less 6 comparison between adsorption and photocatalytic remediation approaches the two different approaches adsorption and photocatalytic degradation for the removal of organic chemical contaminants in water are both efficient and fast photocatalytic degradation is an eco friendly approach as the photocatalysts are environmentally benign and it takes care of the shortcoming of adsorption which is the transfer of contaminant from one phase to another which results in the generation of secondary waste after the adsorption process prompting the major concern of disposal of the spent adsorbents zhao et al 2018 mashile et al 2022 the photocatalytic degradation remediation approach converts or destroys the organic chemical contaminant into less toxic harmful by products or completely mineralizes it to obtain co2 and water as end products the co2 can be trapped and used as a clean source of energy and the water can also undergo further reactions for oxygen and hydrogen evolution which gives this approach more edge over adsorption photocatalytic degradation has proven to be more efficient than adsorption by the complete removal of the organic chemical pollutant for sustainable engineering t materials utilized in wastewater treatment must have potential for reuse for adsorption processes desorption has been identified as a method for regeneration it is important to identify an elutant that is eco friendly and cost effective and one that will not damage the adsorbent material lata et al 2014 ahamad et al 2020b vakili et al 2019 listed desorption agents such as salts alkalis acids and chelating acids and concluded that acid eluents have the highest desorption efficiency for regeneration other techniques for regenerating spent adsorbents include chemical thermal and biological methods momina et al 2018 the reuse of the adsorbents over different cycles can result in the leaching of some of the organic chemical molecules that were not desorbed into the solution thereby reducing the efficiency of the adsorbent which is not the case for photocatalyst as the organic chemical molecule has been mineralized gusain et al 2019 various studies have reported the regeneration and reuse potential of photocatalysts over numerous cycles in the degradation of organic pollutants adenuga et al 2021 reported 79 degradation of tetracycline even after three cycles when using agcl bi24o31cl10 as a visible light photocatalyst similarly the recyclability of titanium dioxide p25 and titanium dioxide grafted β cyclodextrin p25 β cd used for the photocatalytic degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid have been reported they report between 82 6 and 84 efficiency of the photocatalytic materials after five cycles of irradiation safa et al 2019 interestingly in most photocatalytic degradation adsorption plays a vital role as the contaminants are first adsorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst and the photodegradation takes place on the surface through the hole or the active species so many researchers have reported that adsorption enhances photodegradation as the surface area of the photocatalyst plays a big role in electron injection some studies have synthesized materials with adsorptive and photocatalytic potential chitin cl poly itaconic acid co acrylamide zirconium tungstate nanocomposite hydrogel was developed for the removal of sulphon black dye with 92 66 removal under adsorptional photocatalysis conditions sharma et al 2021a wei et al 2021 also established that the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue using ceo2 g c3n4 was enhanced by adsorption and that through photodegradation the adsorption sites on the photocatalyst were regenerated table 4 entails a further comparison between the two remediation techniques 7 water treatment challenges and prospects in developing countries most developing countries do not have extensive environmental monitoring programs for emerging chemical pollutants and lack strict legislative guidelines for several chemical wastes resulting in the inability to set the maximum permissible levels for several hazardous compounds in water bodies adeola and forbes 2022 therefore there is a need to carry out detailed risk assessments of several emerging chemical pollutants in water bodies and set permissible levels in terms of concentrations in effluents discharged into water bodies several adsorbents and photocatalysts described in this survey are still prototypes that have not undergone field applications while a handful has been applied on an industrial scale and proved efficient however there are drawbacks such as high operational cost fouling difficulty in regeneration long treatment time generation of a large amount of sludge or secondary pollutants etc adeola and forbes 2021 adeola et al 2022b bayode et al 2021a pathak et al 2022 there is an urgent need for the development of more efficient wastewater sewage and drinking water treatment methods in developing countries to reduce the risk and adverse effects of exposure to these pollutants the lack of advanced analytical facilities in most countries has constrained research and development efforts the synthesis of green nanomaterials and specialized materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have been limited to countries with research facilities that can purchase advanced equipment such as the cvd instrument used for eco friendly preparation of these adsorbents and photocatalysts therefore there is a need for more research funding through public private partnerships between government agencies and industries in both developing and developed countries towards improving existing water treatment strategies and preventing the destruction of our ecosystem more compact cost effective robust and efficient water treatment technologies such as membrane technology and integrated systems combination of two or more techniques hold great potential for pollution remediation without the extensive use of chemicals initial hype about photocatalytic treatment was based on outstanding performance under unrealistic lab settings that allowed treating small volumes of water with high energy intensive lamps major challenges were identified in real water matrices in which degradation kinetics had decelerated due to the presence of scavengers and competing species gauging the effectiveness of photocatalysts thus needs to occur in more realistic environments and consider the influence of natural organic matter and inorganic species further research to improve even optimize the photocatalyst performance in complex environments and large volumes as well as mimicking natural water in real world environments is also urgently needed understanding the effects of water matrices can aid in strategizing novel materials or at least identifying niche applications of photocatalytic processes considering the true scale of environmental pollution a prominent challenge to the translation of photocatalytic technology is the inability to design a reactor and the cost of manufacturing reactors that can treat large volumes of water e g lakes and reservoirs reactor design and techno economic evaluation remain an enormous challenge to the practicality of photocatalytic degradation of pollutants in real life water systems future studies should focus on the development of benchmark reactors and compare passive and active treatment technologies towards harnessing a promising photocatalytic treatment approach for organic pollutants 8 conclusion the occurrence of chemical pollutants in water bodies raises concern due to their bioaccumulation potential non target exposures and adverse health effects water reusability must be considered due to the increasing demand for clean water thus wastewater treatment plants should be improved to handle the fast growing environmental and economic demands for safe water in this article an extensive bibliometric analysis was carrried out on adsorption and photocatalysis as remediation strategies for organic pollutants in water the synthesis of various photocatalysts and carbon based adsorbents were briefly discussed furthermore the mechanism of degradation of different classes of pollutants was evaluated while considering the removal efficiencies and process variables for optimal performance the use of cheap and eco friendly carbon based adsorbents and semiconductor photocatalysts remains the most cost effective and widely utilized remedial approach to date with green photocatalysts and nanocomposites holding immense potential for future practical applications as shown in this review most studies focused mainly on single pollutant degradation or adsorption for future studies it will be beneficial to evaluate the adsorption and photocatalytic remediation of polluted water with multiple contaminants and establish the effect of natural organic matter on photocatalytic processes in real water samples also more robust efficient and eco friendly nano adsorbents and photocatalysts are required over the years ease of industrial application of carbon based materials for industrial municipal water treatment and operational cost of photoreactors has offered considerable limitations therefore emerging technologies must seek to surmount these challenges and proffer solutions more adaptable for large scale practical applications in developing countries of the world credit
