10750,a 3 yr field study was conducted in semiarid areas of the loess plateau to investigate the effects of different planting densities on the soil water potato growth yield and wue during the normal year 2015 relatively dry year 2016 and relatively wet year 2017 the five potato planting densities were 3 75 104 a traditional local planting density as a control 4 50 104 b 5 25 104 c 6 00 104 d and 6 75 104 plants ha 1 e during the three years the differences in soil water storage among the five planting densities were significant in the early and middle potato growth stages when the soil water storage levels in treatments b and c were 8 8 and 10 8 higher p 0 05 than those in a treatments b and c significantly p 0 05 increased the potato emergence rate by 12 5 and 7 5 to promote growth in the early and middle stages the planting density had a decreasing parabolic relationship with the potato yield after fitting a function to the three years of data the highest tuber potato yield varied with the amount of rainfall and the optimum level was 5 12 5 58 104 plants ha 1 the wue and rainwater use efficiency rwue were significantly higher under b and c compared with a in the normal and relatively dry years wue and rwue were significantly higher in b c and d compared with a in the relatively wet year the optimum planting density with treatments b and c obtained higher net profits thus the recommended optimum planting density should be 4 50 5 12 104 plants ha 1 in relatively dry years and 5 13 5 58 104 plants ha 1 in normal and relatively wet years to increase dryland potato production and water use efficiency in the semiarid regions of the loess plateau china keywords planting density potato growth rainfall soil water water use efficiency yield 1 introduction in the dryland farming region of southern ningxia located in the arid and semiarid areas of the loess plateau the average annual rainfall is 450 mm but the distribution of the rainfall is uneven where 70 occurs during july september and thus the lack of rainfall is the primary factor that limits potato production in this area hou et al 2013 hou and li 2018 reducing the evaporation of water can improve the water use efficiency wue in addition the planting density is one of the most important factors that affect the crop yield and wue ren et al 2016 particularly in semiarid areas such as ningxia where water losses via evaporation are high jia et al 2017 adjusting the planting density is an important agronomic practice that can increase the tuber yield of potato vasilyev 2014 thus zheng et al 2016 showed that a lower potato yield was positively correlated with the planting density the potato yield can increase as the planting density increase over a certain range bussan et al 2007 however if the planting density is excessively high the competition between plants for solar radiation water and nutrients will ultimately lead to lower potato tuber yield allen and wurr 1992 therefore screening the optimum planting density to fully utilize limited precipitation is very important for increasing the potato yield and wue ren et al 2016 and it is beneficial for reducing competition among plants for nutrients and water to increase vegetative growth thereby enhancing photoassimilate partitioning into the potato tuber formation jin et al 2013 dryland agro ecosystems are affected by precipitation in arid and semiarid regions of southern ningxia where agricultural production is completely dependent on natural precipitation the instability and uneven distribution of the inter annual and seasonal precipitation lead to different seasonal precipitation patterns and high volatility in the crop yield hou et al 2013 the crop yield is negatively correlated with precipitation with the highest yield in dry years followed by normal years and the lowest in humid years ye and liu 2012 gao et al 2015 however wang et al 2018 reported that the crop yield was positively related with seasonal precipitation patterns where the highest average crop yield was obtained in a humid year followed by a normal year and dry year the interannual variations in precipitation differ greatly among different seasonal precipitation patterns but the local crops are suitable for the water environment due to long term ecological adaptation wang et al 2007 tokatlidis 2013 concluded that the optimum planting density varies significantly according to the climate in the loess plateau area with annual precipitation of 600 mm liu et al 2014a found that the maize yield increased as the planting density increased in two out of three years but the planting density did not significantly affect the grain yield when the three years of data were pooled together in this water limited area zhang et al 2019 also reported that increasing the planting density did not necessarily increase the crop yield but maintaining the planting density at an intermediate level could maximize the crop yield many studies have investigated the planting density for various crops but there is a lack of detailed information regarding the appropriate planting density for potatoes in the dryland farming region of southern ningxia moreover short term field experiments are unlikely to allow the optimum potato planting density to be determined in a reliable manner especially in this region with highly variable annual precipitation thus it is important to determine the most suitable planting density of potato in a changeable climatic environment in order to improve the potato yield and wue in the loess plateau area of china therefore we tested different potato planting densities under three annual rainfall conditions comprising a relatively dry year normal year and relatively wet year the objectives of our study were 1 to determine the appropriate planting density for spring potato and 2 to investigate the effects of different planting densities on the soil water crop growth tuber yield wue and rainwater use efficiency rwue the results obtained in this study provide a theoretical basis for determining a reasonable planting density during dryland potato farming in the loess plateau region in years with variable rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted during the growing season in 2015 2017 at the special industry base of

of the people s republic of china 2008 the annual precipitation patterns can be divided into normal precipitation anomaly percentage pap actual precipitation average precipitation average precipitation 100 relative dry pap 15 and relative wet pap 15 patterns according to the 20 year precipitation 305 5 mm and growing season precipitation 232 2 mm data the potato growing season was relatively dry in 2016 normal in 2015 and relatively wet in 2017 at the experimental site the experimental field was flat and the soil was a calcic chernozem sand 0 05 2 0 mm 26 silt 0 002 0 05 mm 42 5 and clay 0 002 mm 21 5 with a mean bulk density of 1 34 g cm 3 ph of 8 2 field water holding capacity of 37 3 and permanent wilting point of 9 8 according to the fao unesco soil classification fao unesco 1993 the organic matter content and available n p and k in the 0 to 0 30 m soil layer were 10 3 g kg 1 50 0 mg kg 1 42 6 mg kg 1 and 330 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment tested five treatment groups with potato planting densities of 3 75 104 a the local traditional planting density used as the control 4 50 104 b 5 25 104 c 6 00 104 d and 6 75 104 tubers or plants ha 1 e the experiment had a randomized complete block design with four replicates and each plot measured 10 m long 4 0 m wide one week before sowing the experimental site was leveled fertilized ridged and mulched in a single day adjacent plots were separated by a 1 m gap chemical fertilizer comprising 96 6 kg n ha 1 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 60 kg k2o ha 1 was spread and incorporated into the top 30 cm soil layer with rotary tillage and harrowing an additional 90 kg n ha 1 was applied as a top dressing in the potato seedling stage the white polyethylene film was used to fully cover the ridges and furrows in the plots 1 2 m wide and 8 Î¼m thick immediately after preparation potato tubers were planted in ridges where the ridge 60 cm wide and 15 cm high surface width was arched with a slope angle of about 40 and the width of the furrow was about 0 40 m all of the treatments had the same row spacing 0 6 m and plant spacing 0 40 m the potatoes cv qingshu no 8 late maturity variety were planted on may 8 2015 may 1 2016 and may 9 2017 and the corresponding harvest dates were october 12 2015 october 16 2016 and october 15 2017 no irrigation was applied during the study period for each crop cycle manual weeding was undertaken as required during the experimental period 2 3 sampling and analysis the monthly meteorological data precipitation air temperature and humidity radiation wind speed during the 3 year study were obtained from the automatic weather station trm zs2 produced by jinzhou meteorological sci tech co ltd liaoning china at the experimental site the growth period of potato was recorded in the key growing stages seedling early florescence tuber expansion and maturity during the study the maximum root depth of potato was at the 60 cm soil layer and the crop development phases and growth are listed in table 1 2 3 1 soil water and evapotranspiration the soil water content was determined in each plot by taking three random soil core samples using a 54 mm diameter steel core sampling tube which was driven manually to a depth of 1 0 m during each key growing season seedling early florescence tuber expansion and maturity in 2015 2016 and 2017 the soil cores were weighed wet dried in a fan assisted oven at 105 c for 48 h and weighed again to determine the soil water content and bulk density the gravimetric water content was multiplied by the soil bulk density to determine the volumetric water content soil water storage mm was calculated for a 1 0 m profile by multiplying the mean soil volumetric water content by the soil profile depth evapotranspiration et was calculated as huang et al 2005 1 et p i c d r w where p is the rainfall during the crop growing season i is the irrigation c is the upward flow into the root zone d is the downward drainage out of the root zone r is the surface runoff from each plot and w is the change in water content of the soil profile 0 1 0 m depth between planting and harvest period or between the growth stages in this experiment there is no irrigation so i in eq 1 was zero for all plots the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible runoff was never observed as the experimental field was flat there were no heavy rains or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant consequently et 1 can be reduced to et p Î´w 2 3 2 crop establishment and growth crop establishment was determined as the percentage of tubers planted for which seedlings emerged in each plot the number of plants per plot was counted frequently during emergence ten potato plants were selected randomly and marked to measure their height and stem diameter zhang and tian 2007 the total tubers per plot were weighed to determine the tuber yield of potato tuber yield data were calculated and reported on an area basis kg ha 1 for all treatments hou and li 2018 2 3 3 water use efficiency wue and rainwater use efficiency rwue the wue kg mm 1 ha 1 and rwue kg mm 1 ha 1 were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 respectively as described by hussain and al jaloud 1995 and hou et al 2011 2 wue y et 3 rwue y r where y is the crop yield et is the evapotranspiration during the entire growth period and r is the rainfall amount during the potato growing season 2 4 statistical analysis the data were analyzed by analysis of variance anova using the sas 8 01 package sas institute inc nc usa the significance of f values was determined from anova tables multiple comparisons of the annual mean values were performed using duncan s multiple range tests in all of the analyses p 0 05 was considered to indicate a significant difference regression analysis was used to test the relationship between the potato tuber yield and planting density graphs were prepared using excel 2003 3 results 3 1 soil water storage significant differences were found in the soil water storage 0 1 0 m under the planting density treatments during the three key potato growth stages in 2015 2017 fig 2 during the potato growth period the soil water storage decreased initially and then increased in all of the treatments the soil water storage levels were higher during the key potato growth periods in 2015 and 2017 compared with 2016 which was related to the fact that the precipitation was higher in 2015 and 2017 during the different growth stages than that in 2016 the treatments with b and c treatments significantly p 0 05 improved the soil water storage by 8 8 and 10 8 in the early and middle growth stages but no differences were found among all the treatments in the later growth period however there were no significant differences in the soil water levels between a and e during the key potato growing season during the early florescence stage ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rfpfm cultivation increased the soil water storage in the 0 1 0 m soil layer under different planting densities the soil water storage level increased initially in all of the treatments but then decreased as the planting density increased in 2015 the soil water storage was the highest in treatment c and the lowest in e compared with a the soil water storage levels were 7 2 and 8 3 higher p 0 05 in the b and c treatments respectively the highest soil water storage level occurred in b during 2016 and it was 7 0 higher compared with a during 2017 the maximum soil water storage was obtained in b followed by c the soil water storage levels in b and c were 11 9 and 16 8 higher p 0 05 respectively compared with a however the mean soil water storage in e treatments during 2015 2017 was 5 7 lower p 0 05 compared with that in a during the potato tuber expansion stage a vigorous period of growth occurs and the crop water consumption increases greatly thus the soil water storage decreased rapidly under all the treatments in this stage the soil water varied with the annual differences in precipitation during the growing season and there were significant differences among the planting density treatments the soil water storage levels with b and c during 2015 were 6 8 and 5 7 higher compared with a p 0 05 respectively but 5 3 lower p 0 05 in e during 2016 2017 the soil water storage levels were 7 2 and 8 3 higher in b and c respectively compared with a p 0 05 these differences were related to neighborhood competition under all of the treatments the potatoes entered the maturity stage during mid june as the rainfall increased and the soil water content recovered in all of the treatments during 2015 the soil water storage did not differ significantly under all of the treatments during 2016 and 2017 the mean soil water storage were 10 5 14 6 and 16 4 higher in b c and d respectively compared with a p 0 05 but there were no significant differences between a and e 3 2 crop establishment the emergence rate for potatoes is relatively sensitive to the soil water content during the seedling stage and thus studying changes in the water content of the topsoil 0 0 20 m during the seedling stage is helpful for understanding the relationship between the soil water content and crop establishment fig 3 the rfpfm cultivation improved the water status in the topsoil and the various planting densities had significantly different effects on the crop emergence rates during the three year study the highest potato emergence rate was obtained under rfpfm when the planting density was 4 50 104 plants ha 1 during 2015 the emergence rate was not affected significantly by the planting density because the base topsoil water status was the same in all of the treatments fig 3a during 2016 and 2017 the rainfall was low from may to june and the difference in the soil water content under rfpfm cultivation meant that the planting density had a significant effect on the potato emergence rate fig 3b c the highest potato emergence rate was obtained in b and the lowest in a the emergence rates under b c d and e differed significantly from that under a but there were no significant differences between those in b and c and in c d and e compared with that under a the potato emergence rates were 34 2 27 7 15 3 and 12 9 higher p 0 05 under b c d and e respectively in 2016 the significant differences in potato emergence rate were found among the five treatments during 2017 which they were related to the water content of the topsoil in the seedling stage the emergence rate was 4 6 higher p 0 05 under b than a however the differences between the potato emergence rates in a c d and e were not significant 3 3 crop growth the plant height and stem diameter are important indicators for measuring potato development and growth the rainfall distribution differed among the three years thus during 2016 the plant height and stem diameter increased slowly during the early florescence stage but increased rapidly during the middle and later growth stages by contrast the plant height and stem diameter exhibited the opposite trends during 2015 and 2017 table 2 there were differences in the plant height and stem diameter among the planting density treatments which were related to the different amounts of rainfall in the early florescence and tuber expansion stages the highest plant height and stem diameter were obtained under c in 2015 and 2017 however the maximum plant height and stem diameter were achieved under b in 2016 the lowest plant height and stem diameter were obtained with e during the 3 year study during the early florescence stage the mean plant heights in 2015 and 2017 were 11 1 15 3 and 8 3 higher p 0 05 under b c and d than a and the plant height in 2016 was 15 3 higher p 0 05 with b than a but 13 8 lower p 0 05 in e compared with a in 2017 during the potato tuber expansion stage the mean plant heights in 2015 and 2016 were 17 4 and 14 2 higher p 0 05 under b and c than a and the plant height in 2017 was 8 2 13 5 and 17 9 higher p 0 05 with b c d than a while the differences between e and a were not significant in 2015 2017 the general trend of the stem diameter in the early florescence and tuber expansion stages during 2015 and 2017 from highest to lowest was c b d a e while the order of the differences in the stem diameter during 2016 was b c d e a the mean stem diameters were 9 2 and 10 3 higher p 0 05 in b and c than a during the three study years but no significant differences were found between d e and a at the maturity stage there were no significant differences in the plant height and stem diameter among the planting density treatments during the three years of the study 3 4 tuber yield the potato tuber yields were higher during 2015 and 2017 than 2016 fig 4 which correlated with the different amounts of rainfall in each growing season i e the rainfall was much higher during the growing seasons in 2015 and 2017 than that in 2016 as the planting density increased the tuber yield increased initially and then decreased and the planting density had a declining parabolic relationship with the potato yield during the study period significant differences in potato yield were observed between b c and a during 2015 and 2016 but the yield differed significantly in b c d e and a during 2017 however the differences in the 3 year potato yield between e and a were not significant the mean potato yield in 2015 and 2016 were 12 6 and 16 6 higher under b and c than a and the potato yield in 2017 was 12 6 12 8 and 24 4 higher p 0 05 with b c d than a after plotting the potato tuber yield against the planting density during the three year study we determined a highly significant linear relationship with a mean r 2 value of 0 7637 in the normal year of 2015 fig 4a the potato tuber yield and planting density had a quadratic relationship where the regression equation was y 0 000002316x 2 0 23766x 20710 r 2 0 8018 the highest yield was calculated at 5 13 104 plants ha 1 in 2015 for the relatively dry year of 2016 fig 4b the regression equation for the potato tuber yield and planting density was determined as y 0 000002005x 2 0 20525x 10412 r 2 0 7449 the highest yield was calculated at 5 12 104 plants ha 1 in 2016 however for the relatively wet year of 2017 fig 4c the regression equation for the potato yield and planting density was obtained as y 0 0000028765x 2 0 32077x 18480 r 2 0 7443 and the highest yield was calculated at 5 58 104 plants ha 1 therefore after fitting functions to the data the highest potato yield among the different seasonal precipitation patterns was calculated as occurring with 5 12 5 58 104 plants ha 1 3 5 crop et and wue et and wue of potato crops were affected by different planting density treatments and precipitation amounts and distribution during the growing season in each year as shown in table 3 in the relatively dry growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 more than 50 of the total water consumed by the crop came from the stored soil water at planting whereas less came from the stored soil water at planting in the relatively wet growing seasons of 2017 the amounts of rainfall during the potato growing seasons were 180 2 mm in 2015 162 1 mm in 2016 and 282 1 mm in 2017 and the average rainfall in the growing season over the previous 20 years was 232 2 mm the et in the different years followed the order 2017 relatively wet year 2016 normal year 2015 relatively dry year during 2015 and 2016 the et values were slightly higher with b and c than a and the et values were slightly lower with d and e than a however the significant differences were not found between b c d e and a during 2017 the et values were 5 7 8 5 and 9 8 lower p 0 05 with b c and d than a but there was no difference between e and a the maximum average wue and rwue values occurred in the normal year of 2015 followed by the relatively wet year of 2017 whereas the minimum values were recorded in the relatively dry year of 2016 table 3 the average wue and rwue values were 58 7 and 38 9 higher p 0 05 in 2015 respectively than in 2016 and the average rwue in 2017 was 34 7 higher p 0 05 than that in 2016 however there was no difference in the wue between 2015 and 2017 and no difference in the rwue between 2016 and 2017 anova indicated significant effects of the planting density on wue and rwue in the seasonal precipitation patterns during 2015 and 2016 wue and rwue were significantly higher under b and c than a during 2017 wue and rwue were significantly higher under b c and d than a but there were no significant differences in wue and rwue between e and a the 3 year mean wue values were 12 1 15 9 and 9 7 higher p 0 05 under b c and d than a and the 3 year mean rwue values were 14 5 17 8 and 14 3 higher p 0 05 with b c d than a 3 6 economic benefits the seed cost and total net benefit are important factors that can affect the optimum planting density there were obvious differences in the seed costs for the various treatments where the mean seed costs based on market conditions were 6180 6450 6720 6990 and 7260 chinese yuan ha 1 for a b c d and e respectively table 4 during 2015 c increased the net income by 15 5 compared with a but e decreased the net income by 23 4 p 0 05 during 2016 compared with a the net incomes with b and c were increased by 28 8 and 23 7 p 0 05 respectively and the differences among these treatments were significant however during 2017 b c and d obtained higher net income levels compared with a and the highest net income was achieved with c the net incomes under b c and d were increased by 14 9 14 0 and 27 7 p 0 05 respectively compared with that under a thus the optimum planting density was about 5 25 104 plants ha 1 according to our three year study which is similar to the empirical planting densities used by local farmers to obtain the best economic return 4 discussion 4 1 soil water storage increasing the planting density per unit area in a potato field normally enhances the competition between plants for production inputs such as solar radiation water and nutrients supra optimal densities lead to these inputs being wasted allen and wurr 1992 bavec and bavec 2002 but this could be alleviated by increasing the soil moisture under rfpfm cultivation liu et al 2014b jia et al 2018a found that under the ridge furrow planting system a medium planting density 7 50 104 plants ha 1 for maize with limited irrigation 375 m3 ha 1 in the silking stage could increase the soil water storage and crop yield our results showed that as the planting density increased the soil water storage during the key potato growth stage decreased initially and then increased the treatments at 4 50 104 and 5 25 104 plants ha 1 significantly improved the soil water status in the early and middle growth stages but no differences were found among the five planting density treatments in the later growth period these differences occurred because the water consumption was lower under low density planting during the early growth stage but the surface area exposed under rfpfm cultivation was larger and the evaporation of water was affected more greatly by the sunlight and wind jia et al 2018a by contrast increasing the planting density led to increased competition for space thereby enhancing the competition for light moisture and nutrients among the crop plants jia et al 2018b 4 2 crop establishment and growth film mulching increases the soil water content during the early growth stage for potatoes to promote crop development hou and li 2018 plant vigor in terms of the height and stem diameter per plant also varies significantly at different planting densities sharma and singh 2010 yue et al 2017 reported that an excessively high planting density affected the emergence of potatoes where the emergence rates decreased significantly at 4 50 104 and 5 25 104 plants ha 1 and a planting density higher than 5 25 104 plants ha 1 resulted in only a slight increase in the plant height however zhang 2012 showed that the plant height increased with the planting density for potatoes whereas the stem diameter decreased as the planting density increased in the present study we found that the planting density affected the emergence rate plant height and stem diameter where a planting density of 4 50 104 plants ha 1 decreased the emergence rate and a planting density higher than 5 25 104 plants ha 1 greatly affected the plant height and stem diameter the significant increase in plant growth and development as the planting density increased could be attributed to the adequate availability of space and nutrients to allow the plants to develop to their full vigor singh et al 1997 by contrast a high planting density increased plant stress as well as modifying the plant morphology and development to reduce the yield testa et al 2016 and the competition between plants was exacerbated rossini et al 2011 4 3 tuber yield in the range of the planting density the potato tuber yield had a convex quadratic relationship with the planting density where the maximum value was reached at the medium planting density level lei et al 2013 zhang 2012 wang et al 2015 and zheng et al 2016 also determined a convex quadratic relationship between the potato tuber yield and planting density in an eco region on the plains of southwest china where the highest yield was obtained when the density was 15 75 104 plants ha 1 however ma et al 2011 observed that excessively high and low planting densities were not favorable for improving the potato tuber yield where a density of 5 25 104 plants ha 1 obtained the highest yield when planting densities ranging from 3 75 104 plants ha 1 to 7 50 104 plants ha 1 were tested in the southern mountainous area of ningxia we found that as the planting density increased the potato yield increased initially and then decreased where the relationship was parabolic after fitting a function the highest potato yield was predicted to occur at 5 12 5 58 104 plants ha 1 which agrees with the values reported by he et al 2012 and ma et al 2011 increasing the planting density probably decreased the tuber yield because of the reduced availability of nutrient elements enhanced interspecies competition and the large number of tubers produced by the higher number of stems beraga and caeser 1990 the amount of water and nutrients available for tuber growth decreased when the potato plants grew excessively esmaielpour et al 2011 wang et al 2017 showed that the effect of the row spacing was highest in a normal year followed by humid and dry years the planting density was smaller in the dry year but greater in the humid year yue et al 2017 concluded that a high yield could be obtained with a planting density of 3 75 104 plants ha 1 in an area where the rainfall was below 350 mm but 4 5 104 plants ha 1 in an area where the rainfall was above 350 mm we also found that the optimum planting density for potato was 4 5 104 plants ha 1 to obtain a high yield in a relatively dry year 2016 whereas the optimum planting density was 5 25 104 plants ha 1 in a normal year 2015 and 6 00 104 plants ha 1 in a relatively wet year 2017 thus the optimum planting density varied according to climatic factors rainfall amount as well as study area soil fertility cultivar employed and planting pattern nistor et al 2011 wang et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 jia et al 2018c 4 4 crop et and wue rainfall is the only source of water for crop production in dryland farming li et al 2004 reducing the ineffective evaporation of water can improve the crop wue but the contribution of a reasonable potato planting density to the crop wue is also important liang et al 2015 the actual field water consumption by crops includes stored soil water and rainfall kang et al 2003 and the relationship between et and the planting density depends on precipitation zhang et al 2019 ren et al 2016 found that the planting density had no effect on the et in extremely dry years dry years and mild wet years but a significant influence in normal and extremely wet years zhang et al 2014 detected no significant difference in the et among different planting densities in normal years but significant increases in et as the density increased in a high rainfall year our results are similar to those obtained by zhang et al 2014 and kang et al 2003 thus in this rainfed agricultural region the limited water supply constrained the maximum et and thus the et did not increase significantly at a higher planting density we also found that the treatments at 4 50 104 and 5 25 104 plants ha 1 maintained the relative balance between water consumption and losses because the soil under the reasonable population density retained more water liu et al 2014a however the high planting densities consumed more soil water in the later crop stage jia et al 2018c and the amount of water stored in the topsoil decreased it was because that rfpfm cultivation reduced the evaporation by about 90 but transpiration is the major component of et liu et al 2014b and thus the total available water limited the total transpiration and intraspecific competition increased with the planting density zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 found that the maximum average wue occurred in a dry year and the minimum in a humid year jia et al 2018c showed that in a normal year wue and rwue increased significantly with the planting density but not in a dry year however ren et al 2016 reported that in extremely dry years wue decreased significantly as the planting density increased in the present study the maximum average wue and rwue values occurred in the normal year whereas the minimum values were recorded in the relatively dry year because wue had a positive correlation with the potato yield under rfpfm cultivation zhao et al 2005 and the potato yield was correlated with the different amounts of precipitation in each growing season hou and li 2018 in addition wue and rwue under moderate 4 50 104 and 5 25 104 plants ha 1 and high 6 0 104 plants ha 1 planting densities were significantly higher than those under a low planting density 3 75 104 plants ha 1 because a reasonable planting density could balance the competition for soil water by adjusting the crop population structure zhou et al 2015 5 conclusion in rfpfm cultivation with the moderate planting density 4 50 104 and 5 25 104 plants ha 1 average soil water storage the potato emergence rate plant height and stem diameter during the key growing stage potato yield wue or rwue were significantly higher than those obtained through conventional planting density 3 75 104 plants ha 1 considering the high potato production and water use efficiency in the loess plateau region in years with variable rainfall the planting density of 4 50 5 12 104 plants ha 1 may be better in relatively dry year 2016 however a planting density of 5 13 5 58 104 plants ha 1 is recommended as the optimum value in normal years 2015 and relatively wet years 2017 in the loess plateau with annual rainfall ranges between 300 and 700 mm dryland agriculture is frequently encountered with low and unreliable rainfall and the distribution of precipitation can vary each year the critical planting densities required obtaining the maximum crop yield and wue varied with variable rainfall and the optimum planting density would increase with higher levels of precipitation however the results may be different if the rainfall distribution during the growing season and each year changes substantially therefore it is necessary to consider the long term variations in annual precipitation which requires further study declaration of competing interest no potential conflict of interest

10750,a 3 yr field study was conducted in semiarid areas of the loess plateau to investigate the effects of different planting densities on the soil water potato growth yield and wue during the normal year 2015 relatively dry year 2016 and relatively wet year 2017 the five potato planting densities were 3 75 104 a traditional local planting density as a control 4 50 104 b 5 25 104 c 6 00 104 d and 6 75 104 plants ha 1 e during the three years the differences in soil water storage among the five planting densities were significant in the early and middle potato growth stages when the soil water storage levels in treatments b and c were 8 8 and 10 8 higher p 0 05 than those in a treatments b and c significantly p 0 05 increased the potato emergence rate by 12 5 and 7 5 to promote growth in the early and middle stages the planting density had a decreasing parabolic relationship with the potato yield after fitting a function to the three years of data the highest tuber potato yield varied with the amount of rainfall and the optimum level was 5 12 5 58 104 plants ha 1 the wue and rainwater use efficiency rwue were significantly higher under b and c compared with a in the normal and relatively dry years wue and rwue were significantly higher in b c and d compared with a in the relatively wet year the optimum planting density with treatments b and c obtained higher net profits thus the recommended optimum planting density should be 4 50 5 12 104 plants ha 1 in relatively dry years and 5 13 5 58 104 plants ha 1 in normal and relatively wet years to increase dryland potato production and water use efficiency in the semiarid regions of the loess plateau china keywords planting density potato growth rainfall soil water water use efficiency yield 1 introduction in the dryland farming region of southern ningxia located in the arid and semiarid areas of the loess plateau the average annual rainfall is 450 mm but the distribution of the rainfall is uneven where 70 occurs during july september and thus the lack of rainfall is the primary factor that limits potato production in this area hou et al 2013 hou and li 2018 reducing the evaporation of water can improve the water use efficiency wue in addition the planting density is one of the most important factors that affect the crop yield and wue ren et al 2016 particularly in semiarid areas such as ningxia where water losses via evaporation are high jia et al 2017 adjusting the planting density is an important agronomic practice that can increase the tuber yield of potato vasilyev 2014 thus zheng et al 2016 showed that a lower potato yield was positively correlated with the planting density the potato yield can increase as the planting density increase over a certain range bussan et al 2007 however if the planting density is excessively high the competition between plants for solar radiation water and nutrients will ultimately lead to lower potato tuber yield allen and wurr 1992 therefore screening the optimum planting density to fully utilize limited precipitation is very important for increasing the potato yield and wue ren et al 2016 and it is beneficial for reducing competition among plants for nutrients and water to increase vegetative growth thereby enhancing photoassimilate partitioning into the potato tuber formation jin et al 2013 dryland agro ecosystems are affected by precipitation in arid and semiarid regions of southern ningxia where agricultural production is completely dependent on natural precipitation the instability and uneven distribution of the inter annual and seasonal precipitation lead to different seasonal precipitation patterns and high volatility in the crop yield hou et al 2013 the crop yield is negatively correlated with precipitation with the highest yield in dry years followed by normal years and the lowest in humid years ye and liu 2012 gao et al 2015 however wang et al 2018 reported that the crop yield was positively related with seasonal precipitation patterns where the highest average crop yield was obtained in a humid year followed by a normal year and dry year the interannual variations in precipitation differ greatly among different seasonal precipitation patterns but the local crops are suitable for the water environment due to long term ecological adaptation wang et al 2007 tokatlidis 2013 concluded that the optimum planting density varies significantly according to the climate in the loess plateau area with annual precipitation of 600 mm liu et al 2014a found that the maize yield increased as the planting density increased in two out of three years but the planting density did not significantly affect the grain yield when the three years of data were pooled together in this water limited area zhang et al 2019 also reported that increasing the planting density did not necessarily increase the crop yield but maintaining the planting density at an intermediate level could maximize the crop yield many studies have investigated the planting density for various crops but there is a lack of detailed information regarding the appropriate planting density for potatoes in the dryland farming region of southern ningxia moreover short term field experiments are unlikely to allow the optimum potato planting density to be determined in a reliable manner especially in this region with highly variable annual precipitation thus it is important to determine the most suitable planting density of potato in a changeable climatic environment in order to improve the potato yield and wue in the loess plateau area of china therefore we tested different potato planting densities under three annual rainfall conditions comprising a relatively dry year normal year and relatively wet year the objectives of our study were 1 to determine the appropriate planting density for spring potato and 2 to investigate the effects of different planting densities on the soil water crop growth tuber yield wue and rainwater use efficiency rwue the results obtained in this study provide a theoretical basis for determining a reasonable planting density during dryland potato farming in the loess plateau region in years with variable rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description field experiments were conducted during the growing season in 2015 2017 at the special industry base of

growing season may september were 215 8 162 1 and 282 1 mm table 1 according to the precipitation year classification method in chinese national standard gb t 21986 2008 standardization administration of the people s republic of china 2008 the annual precipitation patterns can be divided into normal precipitation anomaly percentage pap actual precipitation average precipitation average precipitation 100 relative dry pap 15 and relative wet pap 15 patterns according to the 20 year precipitation 305 5 mm and growing season precipitation 232 2 mm data the potato growing season was relatively dry in 2016 normal in 2015 and relatively wet in 2017 at the experimental site the experimental field was flat and the soil was a calcic chernozem sand 0 05 2 0 mm 26 silt 0 002 0 05 mm 42 5 and clay 0 002 mm 21 5 with a mean bulk density of 1 34 g cm 3 ph of 8 2 field water holding capacity of 37 3 and permanent wilting point of 9 8 according to the fao unesco soil classification fao unesco 1993 the organic matter content and available n p and k in the 0 to 0 30 m soil layer were 10 3 g kg 1 50 0 mg kg 1 42 6 mg kg 1 and 330 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design and field management the field experiment tested five treatment groups with potato planting densities of 3 75 104 a the local traditional planting density used as the control 4 50 104 b 5 25 104 c 6 00 104 d and 6 75 104 tubers or plants ha 1 e the experiment had a randomized complete block design with four replicates and each plot measured 10 m long 4 0 m wide one week before sowing the experimental site was leveled fertilized ridged and mulched in a single day adjacent plots were separated by a 1 m gap chemical fertilizer comprising 96 6 kg n ha 1 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 60 kg k2o ha 1 was spread and incorporated into the top 30 cm soil layer with rotary tillage and harrowing an additional 90 kg n ha 1 was applied as a top dressing in the potato seedling stage the white polyethylene film was used to fully cover the ridges and furrows in the plots 1 2 m wide and 8 Î¼m thick immediately after preparation potato tubers were planted in ridges where the ridge 60 cm wide and 15 cm high surface width was arched with a slope angle of about 40 and the width of the furrow was about 0 40 m all of the treatments had the same row spacing 0 6 m and plant spacing 0 40 m the potatoes cv qingshu no 8 late maturity variety were planted on may 8 2015 may 1 2016 and may 9 2017 and the corresponding harvest dates were october 12 2015 october 16 2016 and october 15 2017 no irrigation was applied during the study period for each crop cycle manual weeding was undertaken as required during the experimental period 2 3 sampling and analysis the monthly meteorological data precipitation air temperature and humidity radiation wind speed during the 3 year study were obtained from the automatic weather station trm zs2 produced by jinzhou meteorological sci tech co ltd liaoning china at the experimental site the growth period of potato was recorded in the key growing stages seedling early florescence tuber expansion and maturity during the study the maximum root depth of potato was at the 60 cm soil layer and the crop development phases and growth are listed in table 1 2 3 1 soil water and evapotranspiration the soil water content was determined in each plot by taking three random soil core samples using a 54 mm diameter steel core sampling tube which was driven manually to a depth of 1 0 m during each key growing season seedling early florescence tuber expansion and maturity in 2015 2016 and 2017 the soil cores were weighed wet dried in a fan assisted oven at 105 c for 48 h and weighed again to determine the soil water content and bulk density the gravimetric water content was multiplied by the soil bulk density to determine the volumetric water content soil water storage mm was calculated for a 1 0 m profile by multiplying the mean soil volumetric water content by the soil profile depth evapotranspiration et was calculated as huang et al 2005 1 et p i c d r w where p is the rainfall during the crop growing season i is the irrigation c is the upward flow into the root zone d is the downward drainage out of the root zone r is the surface runoff from each plot and w is the change in water content of the soil profile 0 1 0 m depth between planting and harvest period or between the growth stages in this experiment there is no irrigation so i in eq 1 was zero for all plots the groundwater table remained at a depth of about 50 m below the surface so the upward flow into the root was negligible runoff was never observed as the experimental field was flat there were no heavy rains or water logging events during the growing season so the drainage was assumed to be insignificant consequently et 1 can be reduced to et p Î´w 2 3 2 crop establishment and growth crop establishment was determined as the percentage of tubers planted for which seedlings emerged in each plot the number of plants per plot was counted frequently during emergence ten potato plants were selected randomly and marked to measure their height and stem diameter zhang and tian 2007 the total tubers per plot were weighed to determine the tuber yield of potato tuber yield data were calculated and reported on an area basis kg ha 1 for all treatments hou and li 2018 2 3 3 water use efficiency wue and rainwater use efficiency rwue the wue kg mm 1 ha 1 and rwue kg mm 1 ha 1 were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 respectively as described by hussain and al jaloud 1995 and hou et al 2011 2 wue y et 3 rwue y r where y is the crop yield et is the evapotranspiration during the entire growth period and r is the rainfall amount during the potato growing season 2 4 statistical analysis the data were analyzed by analysis of variance anova using the sas 8 01 package sas institute inc nc usa the significance of f values was determined from anova tables multiple comparisons of the annual mean values were performed using duncan s multiple range tests in all of the analyses p 0 05 was considered to indicate a significant difference regression analysis was used to test the relationship between the potato tuber yield and planting density graphs were prepared using excel 2003 3 results 3 1 soil water storage significant differences were found in the soil water storage 0 1 0 m under the planting density treatments during the three key potato growth stages in 2015 2017 fig 2 during the potato growth period the soil water storage decreased initially and then increased in all of the treatments the soil water storage levels were higher during the key potato growth periods in 2015 and 2017 compared with 2016 which was related to the fact that the precipitation was higher in 2015 and 2017 during the different growth stages than that in 2016 the treatments with b and c treatments significantly p 0 05 improved the soil water storage by 8 8 and 10 8 in the early and middle growth stages but no differences were found among all the treatments in the later growth period however there were no significant differences in the soil water levels between a and e during the key potato growing season during the early florescence stage ridge furrow with plastic film mulching rfpfm cultivation increased the soil water storage in the 0 1 0 m soil layer under different planting densities the soil water storage level increased initially in all of the treatments but then decreased as the planting density increased in 2015 the soil water storage was the highest in treatment c and the lowest in e compared with a the soil water storage levels were 7 2 and 8 3 higher p 0 05 in the b and c treatments respectively the highest soil water storage level occurred in b during 2016 and it was 7 0 higher compared with a during 2017 the maximum soil water storage was obtained in b followed by c the soil water storage levels in b and c were 11 9 and 16 8 higher p 0 05 respectively compared with a however the mean soil water storage in e treatments during 2015 2017 was 5 7 lower p 0 05 compared with that in a during the potato tuber expansion stage a vigorous period of growth occurs and the crop water consumption increases greatly thus the soil water storage decreased rapidly under all the treatments in this stage the soil water varied with the annual differences in precipitation during the growing season and there were significant differences among the planting density treatments the soil water storage levels with b and c during 2015 were 6 8 and 5 7 higher compared with a p 0 05 respectively but 5 3 lower p 0 05 in e during 2016 2017 the soil water storage levels were 7 2 and 8 3 higher in b and c respectively compared with a p 0 05 these differences were related to neighborhood competition under all of the treatments the potatoes entered the maturity stage during mid june as the rainfall increased and the soil water content recovered in all of the treatments during 2015 the soil water storage did not differ significantly under all of the treatments during 2016 and 2017 the mean soil water storage were 10 5 14 6 and 16 4 higher in b c and d respectively compared with a p 0 05 but there were no significant differences between a and e 3 2 crop establishment the emergence rate for potatoes is relatively sensitive to the soil water content during the seedling stage and thus studying changes in the water content of the topsoil 0 0 20 m during the seedling stage is helpful for understanding the relationship between the soil water content and crop establishment fig 3 the rfpfm cultivation improved the water status in the topsoil and the various planting densities had significantly different effects on the crop emergence rates during the three year study the highest potato emergence rate was obtained under rfpfm when the planting density was 4 50 104 plants ha 1 during 2015 the emergence rate was not affected significantly by the planting density because the base topsoil water status was the same in all of the treatments fig 3a during 2016 and 2017 the rainfall was low from may to june and the difference in the soil water content under rfpfm cultivation meant that the planting density had a significant effect on the potato emergence rate fig 3b c the highest potato emergence rate was obtained in b and the lowest in a the emergence rates under b c d and e differed significantly from that under a but there were no significant differences between those in b and c and in c d and e compared with that under a the potato emergence rates were 34 2 27 7 15 3 and 12 9 higher p 0 05 under b c d and e respectively in 2016 the significant differences in potato emergence rate were found among the five treatments during 2017 which they were related to the water content of the topsoil in the seedling stage the emergence rate was 4 6 higher p 0 05 under b than a however the differences between the potato emergence rates in a c d and e were not significant 3 3 crop growth the plant height and stem diameter are important indicators for measuring potato development and growth the rainfall distribution differed among the three years thus during 2016 the plant height and stem diameter increased slowly during the early florescence stage but increased rapidly during the middle and later growth stages by contrast the plant height and stem diameter exhibited the opposite trends during 2015 and 2017 table 2 there were differences in the plant height and stem diameter among the planting density treatments which were related to the different amounts of rainfall in the early florescence and tuber expansion stages the highest plant height and stem diameter were obtained under c in 2015 and 2017 however the maximum plant height and stem diameter were achieved under b in 2016 the lowest plant height and stem diameter were obtained with e during the 3 year study during the early florescence stage the mean plant heights in 2015 and 2017 were 11 1 15 3 and 8 3 higher p 0 05 under b c and d than a and the plant height in 2016 was 15 3 higher p 0 05 with b than a but 13 8 lower p 0 05 in e compared with a in 2017 during the potato tuber expansion stage the mean plant heights in 2015 and 2016 were 17 4 and 14 2 higher p 0 05 under b and c than a and the plant height in 2017 was 8 2 13 5 and 17 9 higher p 0 05 with b c d than a while the differences between e and a were not significant in 2015 2017 the general trend of the stem diameter in the early florescence and tuber expansion stages during 2015 and 2017 from highest to lowest was c b d a e while the order of the differences in the stem diameter during 2016 was b c d e a the mean stem diameters were 9 2 and 10 3 higher p 0 05 in b and c than a during the three study years but no significant differences were found between d e and a at the maturity stage there were no significant differences in the plant height and stem diameter among the planting density treatments during the three years of the study 3 4 tuber yield the potato tuber yields were higher during 2015 and 2017 than 2016 fig 4 which correlated with the different amounts of rainfall in each growing season i e the rainfall was much higher during the growing seasons in 2015 and 2017 than that in 2016 as the planting density increased the tuber yield increased initially and then decreased and the planting density had a declining parabolic relationship with the potato yield during the study period significant differences in potato yield were observed between b c and a during 2015 and 2016 but the yield differed significantly in b c d e and a during 2017 however the differences in the 3 year potato yield between e and a were not significant the mean potato yield in 2015 and 2016 were 12 6 and 16 6 higher under b and c than a and the potato yield in 2017 was 12 6 12 8 and 24 4 higher p 0 05 with b c d than a after plotting the potato tuber yield against the planting density during the three year study we determined a highly significant linear relationship with a mean r 2 value of 0 7637 in the normal year of 2015 fig 4a the potato tuber yield and planting density had a quadratic relationship where the regression equation was y 0 000002316x 2 0 23766x 20710 r 2 0 8018 the highest yield was calculated at 5 13 104 plants ha 1 in 2015 for the relatively dry year of 2016 fig 4b the regression equation for the potato tuber yield and planting density was determined as y 0 000002005x 2 0 20525x 10412 r 2 0 7449 the highest yield was calculated at 5 12 104 plants ha 1 in 2016 however for the relatively wet year of 2017 fig 4c the regression equation for the potato yield and planting density was obtained as y 0 0000028765x 2 0 32077x 18480 r 2 0 7443 and the highest yield was calculated at 5 58 104 plants ha 1 therefore after fitting functions to the data the highest potato yield among the different seasonal precipitation patterns was calculated as occurring with 5 12 5 58 104 plants ha 1 3 5 crop et and wue et and wue of potato crops were affected by different planting density treatments and precipitation amounts and distribution during the growing season in each year as shown in table 3 in the relatively dry growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 more than 50 of the total water consumed by the crop came from the stored soil water at planting whereas less came from the stored soil water at planting in the relatively wet growing seasons of 2017 the amounts of rainfall during the potato growing seasons were 180 2 mm in 2015 162 1 mm in 2016 and 282 1 mm in 2017 and the average rainfall in the growing season over the previous 20 years was 232 2 mm the et in the different years followed the order 2017 relatively wet year 2016 normal year 2015 relatively dry year during 2015 and 2016 the et values were slightly higher with b and c than a and the et values were slightly lower with d and e than a however the significant differences were not found between b c d e and a during 2017 the et values were 5 7 8 5 and 9 8 lower p 0 05 with b c and d than a but there was no difference between e and a the maximum average wue and rwue values occurred in the normal year of 2015 followed by the relatively wet year of 2017 whereas the minimum values were recorded in the relatively dry year of 2016 table 3 the average wue and rwue values were 58 7 and 38 9 higher p 0 05 in 2015 respectively than in 2016 and the average rwue in 2017 was 34 7 higher p 0 05 than that in 2016 however there was no difference in the wue between 2015 and 2017 and no difference in the rwue between 2016 and 2017 anova indicated significant effects of the planting density on wue and rwue in the seasonal precipitation patterns during 2015 and 2016 wue and rwue were significantly higher under b and c than a during 2017 wue and rwue were significantly higher under b c and d than a but there were no significant differences in wue and rwue between e and a the 3 year mean wue values were 12 1 15 9 and 9 7 higher p 0 05 under b c and d than a and the 3 year mean rwue values were 14 5 17 8 and 14 3 higher p 0 05 with b c d than a 3 6 economic benefits the seed cost and total net benefit are important factors that can affect the optimum planting density there were obvious differences in the seed costs for the various treatments where the mean seed costs based on market conditions were 6180 6450 6720 6990 and 7260 chinese yuan ha 1 for a b c d and e respectively table 4 during 2015 c increased the net income by 15 5 compared with a but e decreased the net income by 23 4 p 0 05 during 2016 compared with a the net incomes with b and c were increased by 28 8 and 23 7 p 0 05 respectively and the differences among these treatments were significant however during 2017 b c and d obtained higher net income levels compared with a and the highest net income was achieved with c the net incomes under b c and d were increased by 14 9 14 0 and 27 7 p 0 05 respectively compared with that under a thus the optimum planting density was about 5 25 104 plants ha 1 according to our three year study which is similar to the empirical planting densities used by local farmers to obtain the best economic return 4 discussion 4 1 soil water storage increasing the planting density per unit area in a potato field normally enhances the competition between plants for production inputs such as solar radiation water and nutrients supra optimal densities lead to these inputs being wasted allen and wurr 1992 bavec and bavec 2002 but this could be alleviated by increasing the soil moisture under rfpfm cultivation liu et al 2014b jia et al 2018a found that under the ridge furrow planting system a medium planting density 7 50 104 plants ha 1 for maize with limited irrigation 375 m3 ha 1 in the silking stage could increase the soil water storage and crop yield our results showed that as the planting density increased the soil water storage during the key potato growth stage decreased initially and then increased the treatments at 4 50 104 and 5 25 104 plants ha 1 significantly improved the soil water status in the early and middle growth stages but no differences were found among the five planting density treatments in the later growth period these differences occurred because the water consumption was lower under low density planting during the early growth stage but the surface area exposed under rfpfm cultivation was larger and the evaporation of water was affected more greatly by the sunlight and wind jia et al 2018a by contrast increasing the planting density led to increased competition for space thereby enhancing the competition for light moisture and nutrients among the crop plants jia et al 2018b 4 2 crop establishment and growth film mulching increases the soil water content during the early growth stage for potatoes to promote crop development hou and li 2018 plant vigor in terms of the height and stem diameter per plant also varies significantly at different planting densities sharma and singh 2010 yue et al 2017 reported that an excessively high planting density affected the emergence of potatoes where the emergence rates decreased significantly at 4 50 104 and 5 25 104 plants ha 1 and a planting density higher than 5 25 104 plants ha 1 resulted in only a slight increase in the plant height however zhang 2012 showed that the plant height increased with the planting density for potatoes whereas the stem diameter decreased as the planting density increased in the present study we found that the planting density affected the emergence rate plant height and stem diameter where a planting density of 4 50 104 plants ha 1 decreased the emergence rate and a planting density higher than 5 25 104 plants ha 1 greatly affected the plant height and stem diameter the significant increase in plant growth and development as the planting density increased could be attributed to the adequate availability of space and nutrients to allow the plants to develop to their full vigor singh et al 1997 by contrast a high planting density increased plant stress as well as modifying the plant morphology and development to reduce the yield testa et al 2016 and the competition between plants was exacerbated rossini et al 2011 4 3 tuber yield in the range of the planting density the potato tuber yield had a convex quadratic relationship with the planting density where the maximum value was reached at the medium planting density level lei et al 2013 zhang 2012 wang et al 2015 and zheng et al 2016 also determined a convex quadratic relationship between the potato tuber yield and planting density in an eco region on the plains of southwest china where the highest yield was obtained when the density was 15 75 104 plants ha 1 however ma et al 2011 observed that excessively high and low planting densities were not favorable for improving the potato tuber yield where a density of 5 25 104 plants ha 1 obtained the highest yield when planting densities ranging from 3 75 104 plants ha 1 to 7 50 104 plants ha 1 were tested in the southern mountainous area of ningxia we found that as the planting density increased the potato yield increased initially and then decreased where the relationship was parabolic after fitting a function the highest potato yield was predicted to occur at 5 12 5 58 104 plants ha 1 which agrees with the values reported by he et al 2012 and ma et al 2011 increasing the planting density probably decreased the tuber yield because of the reduced availability of nutrient elements enhanced interspecies competition and the large number of tubers produced by the higher number of stems beraga and caeser 1990 the amount of water and nutrients available for tuber growth decreased when the potato plants grew excessively esmaielpour et al 2011 wang et al 2017 showed that the effect of the row spacing was highest in a normal year followed by humid and dry years the planting density was smaller in the dry year but greater in the humid year yue et al 2017 concluded that a high yield could be obtained with a planting density of 3 75 104 plants ha 1 in an area where the rainfall was below 350 mm but 4 5 104 plants ha 1 in an area where the rainfall was above 350 mm we also found that the optimum planting density for potato was 4 5 104 plants ha 1 to obtain a high yield in a relatively dry year 2016 whereas the optimum planting density was 5 25 104 plants ha 1 in a normal year 2015 and 6 00 104 plants ha 1 in a relatively wet year 2017 thus the optimum planting density varied according to climatic factors rainfall amount as well as study area soil fertility cultivar employed and planting pattern nistor et al 2011 wang et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 jia et al 2018c 4 4 crop et and wue rainfall is the only source of water for crop production in dryland farming li et al 2004 reducing the ineffective evaporation of water can improve the crop wue but the contribution of a reasonable potato planting density to the crop wue is also important liang et al 2015 the actual field water consumption by crops includes stored soil water and rainfall kang et al 2003 and the relationship between et and the planting density depends on precipitation zhang et al 2019 ren et al 2016 found that the planting density had no effect on the et in extremely dry years dry years and mild wet years but a significant influence in normal and extremely wet years zhang et al 2014 detected no significant difference in the et among different planting densities in normal years but significant increases in et as the density increased in a high rainfall year our results are similar to those obtained by zhang et al 2014 and kang et al 2003 thus in this rainfed agricultural region the limited water supply constrained the maximum et and thus the et did not increase significantly at a higher planting density we also found that the treatments at 4 50 104 and 5 25 104 plants ha 1 maintained the relative balance between water consumption and losses because the soil under the reasonable population density retained more water liu et al 2014a however the high planting densities consumed more soil water in the later crop stage jia et al 2018c and the amount of water stored in the topsoil decreased it was because that rfpfm cultivation reduced the evaporation by about 90 but transpiration is the major component of et liu et al 2014b and thus the total available water limited the total transpiration and intraspecific competition increased with the planting density zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 found that the maximum average wue occurred in a dry year and the minimum in a humid year jia et al 2018c showed that in a normal year wue and rwue increased significantly with the planting density but not in a dry year however ren et al 2016 reported that in extremely dry years wue decreased significantly as the planting density increased in the present study the maximum average wue and rwue values occurred in the normal year whereas the minimum values were recorded in the relatively dry year because wue had a positive correlation with the potato yield under rfpfm cultivation zhao et al 2005 and the potato yield was correlated with the different amounts of precipitation in each growing season hou and li 2018 in addition wue and rwue under moderate 4 50 104 and 5 25 104 plants ha 1 and high 6 0 104 plants ha 1 planting densities were significantly higher than those under a low planting density 3 75 104 plants ha 1 because a reasonable planting density could balance the competition for soil water by adjusting the crop population structure zhou et al 2015 5 conclusion in rfpfm cultivation with the moderate planting density 4 50 104 and 5 25 104 plants ha 1 average soil water storage the potato emergence rate plant height and stem diameter during the key growing stage potato yield wue or rwue were significantly higher than those obtained through conventional planting density 3 75 104 plants ha 1 considering the high potato production and water use efficiency in the loess plateau region in years with variable rainfall the planting density of 4 50 5 12 104 plants ha 1 may be better in relatively dry year 2016 however a planting density of 5 13 5 58 104 plants ha 1 is recommended as the optimum value in normal years 2015 and relatively wet years 2017 in the loess plateau with annual rainfall ranges between 300 and 700 mm dryland agriculture is frequently encountered with low and unreliable rainfall and the distribution of precipitation can vary each year the critical planting densities required obtaining the maximum crop yield and wue varied with variable rainfall and the optimum planting density would increase with higher levels of precipitation however the results may be different if the rainfall distribution during the growing season and each year changes substantially therefore it is necessary to consider the long term variations in annual precipitation which requires further study declaration of competing interest no potential conflict of interest

10751,diversifying the summer fallow f winter wheat triticum aestivum l w cropping system by replacing summer fallow with forage crops could increase forage yield and precipitation use efficiency in the loess plateau region of china however its influence on protein productivity is unclear and it is unknown whether improvement in protein productivity will increase soil water extraction and economic input a three year 2011 2013 field experiment was conducted to investigate the rotational effect on system productivity economic benefit and sustainability when summer fallow was replaced with forage rape brassica napus l r and common vetch vicia sativa l v results showed that the rotation system with forage crops did not alter soil water storage of subsequent winter wheat compared with the fwfw rotation system the rotation system with forage crops improved precipitation use efficiency of crude protein yield puecp and system water use efficiency of crude protein yield wuecp by 20 and 28 respectively the greatest crude protein productivity cpyield was achieved with the rwrw rotation system followed by the fwrw and rwvw systems and cpyield with these systems was 51 21 and 36 greater than that with the fwfw system respectively p 0 05 in contrast net income in the fwfw rotation system had the greatest value u s 2 005 ha 1 27 20 34 and 29 greater than that in the fwvw rwvw fwrw and rwrw systems respectively p 0 05 consequently the alternate rotation system of fwfw and rwrw is recommended for local farmers when considering both profitability and sustainability keywords summer fallow annual forage water use yield net income rainfed farming systems 1 introduction water is the primary limiting factor for agriculture and forage production in the rainfed regions in the loess plateau of northwestern china ding et al 2018 li et al 2018 traditionally winter wheat triticum aestivum l monoculture has been a popular cropping practice in this region karlen et al 1994 summer fallow is usually used to lower the risk of loss in crop production by abandoning production in one season to guarantee crop productive potential of the next season nielsen and vigil 2010 and reduce material and energy input greb 1979 however previous studies have reported that summer fallowing had a negative impact on the environment unger et al 1997 farahani et al 1998 there were more weeds growing in the field during the fallow period which increased chemical input norwood and dhuyvetter 1993 more importantly the summer fallow period decreases system water use efficiency wue and precipitation use efficiency pue kang et al 2001 resulting in a substantial waste of water therefore it is necessary to explore suitable cropping systems to improve crop and forage production planting cover crops in the summer fallow period has been an effective technique to guarantee both crop and forage production gardner 1993 thorup kristensen et al 2003 garcia et al 2008 which increased crop productivity potential and pue peterson and westfall 2015 li et al 2002 nielsen and vigil 2005reported that reducing the fallow frequency with legume crops generally resulted in higher wheat yield and forage production which was attributed to greater amounts of surface crop residues remaining nielsen and calderÃ³n 2011reported that replacing a summer fallow period with a cover crop could increase pue by 17 while kaan et al 2002 found that the use of cover crops increased economic net income by 36 therefore it is particularly urgent to select suitable cover crops for local crop and forage production with the characteristics of rapid growth and flexible usage during the growing season annual forage crops with high quality that are considered to be ideal candidates to diversify and optimize local farming systems include common vetch vicia sativa l and forage rape brassica napus l abate et al 2003 reported that planting forage vetch in a short fallow period could increase forage yield by 2 0 t ha 1 and that forage rape as an annual forage produced relatively large amounts of forage in the short term liu et al 2014 furthermore planting forage as cover crops could also produce considerable crude protein yield cpyield due to common vetch and forage rape having high protein content zhang et al 2018 reported that legumes had higher crude protein cp concentration and produced equivalent or greater cpyield compared to the grasses forage rape has high crude protein concentration which is similar to that of legume crops yang et al 2003 although planting forages as cover crops in the summer fallow period could effectively promote forage production it has a potential risk on sustainability if the availability of soil water and precipitation cannot meet crop demand in addition since cp is an important evaluation indicator for forage quality as well as livestock production coleman and moore 2003 it is necessary to evaluate the production and wue of crude protein yield wuecp for selecting suitable cropping systems to resolve the high quality forage feed deficit for local sustainable livestock production in the loess plateau of china however previous research in this region has primarily focused on crop biomass and less attention has been given to cp production plaza bonilla et al 2017 only gan et al 2015 reported that eliminating summer fallow with forage crops could enhance system cpyield by 18 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the sustainability of crop rotation systems by comparing soil water storage at sowing and harvest for each crop in all rotation systems 2 investigate the variation of wuecp and precipitation use efficiency puecp among rotation systems when summer fallow was replaced with forage crops and 3 evaluate change of cpyield and net income in the different rotation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this field study was conducted at the loess plateau research station of lanzhou

2013 there were five crop rotations summer fallow winter wheat summer fallow winter wheat fwfw summer fallow winter wheat common vetch winter wheat fwvw forage rape winter wheat common vetch winter wheat rwvw summer fallow winter wheat forage rape winter wheat fwrw and forage rape winter wheat forage rape winter wheat rwrw fig 1 the experiment was conducted by using a randomized complete block design with four replications 2 3 crop and field management the experiment was conducted in a rainfed farming system with a plot area of 20 m2 4 m 5 m the distance between adjacent plots was 1 m all plots were moldboard plowed to a depth of 30 cm followed by harrowing and culti packing just prior to sowing details regarding the crop cultivars sowing and fertilization are provided in table 1 winter wheat common vetch and forage rape seeds were sown by hand at a rate of 225 120 and 15 kg ha 1 respectively winter wheat and common vetch were sown at 30 mm depth using a drill while forage rape seed was surface broadcast winter wheat and common vetch were sown with 15 and 20 cm row spacing respectively at sowing fertilization included the application of 225 kg ha 1 of triple superphosphate for all species and 150 kg ha 1 urea at the regreening stage for winter wheat and at the sowing stage for forage rape based on local practices table 1 weeds were controlled manually during the growing season 2 4 data collection and measurement 2 4 1 meteorological condition air temperature and precipitation were recorded daily using a pc200w automatic meteorological station campbell scientific placed within 50 m of the experimental field 2 4 2 crop yield and n content of crop winter wheat was sampled at physiological maturity from three randomly placed quadrats within each plot to calculate grain yield each quadrat covered a 1 m length of two rows and had an area of 0 3 m2 forage rape and common vetch were harvested when approximately 50 of the plants were in the flowering stage from three randomly placed quadrats 1 1 m within each plot to determine forage yield for all crops a distance of at least 50 cm was left between sampling areas all samples were oven dried at 80 c to a constant weight prior to calculation of yield and subsequent analysis of n concentration which was determined using the kjeldahl method bremner 1965 2 4 3 soil water content soil water content was measured using the gravimetric method in each plot at sowing and harvest of each crop in all years during 2011 2013 soil samples were collected in 10 cm increments in the 0 30 cm soil layer in 30 cm increments in the 30 150 cm soil layer and in a 50 cm increment for the 150 200 cm soil layer the samples were oven dried at 105 c for 48 h to determine soil water content soil water storage sws mm was calculated using the following equation dam et al 2005 1 sws h w b 10 where sws is soil water storage mm h is the thickness of a measured soil layer cm w is the mass soil water content of a given soil layer g g 1 and b is soil bulk density of a given soil layer g cm 3 2 5 indicator calculation 2 5 1 cpyield crude protein concentration was calculated by multiplying the n concentration by 6 25 horwitz 1980 tian et al 2012 crude protein yield was calculated using the following equation 2 cpyield y cpc where cpyield is the yield of crude protein kg ha 1 y is crop yield winter wheat grain yield at maturity and forage yield at the flowering stage kg ha 1 and cpc is crude protein concentration of the crop grain cpc for winter wheat at maturity and whole plant cpc for forage at the flowering stage g g 1 2 5 2 wue and pue seasonal evapotranspiration et mm was calculated for each growing season using the field water balance equation lenssen et al 2007 huang et al 2005 shen et al 2009 3 et p s r dp cr where p is the total seasonal precipitation mm s is the change in stored soil water of the soil profile mm from sowing to harvest r is surface runoff mm dp is the deep percolation of the soil water in the root zone mm and cr is the capillary rise of water surface runoff was not considered since the experimental site had a flat topography deep percolation of soil water was neglected in our calculations since we assumed that precipitation water rarely infiltrated to the depth of 200 cm in the short term the groundwater table of the experimental field is approximately 50 m below the surface so cr to the root was considered negligible water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated for cpyield wuecp yield wueyield and precipitation use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated for cpyield puecp as follows zhang et al 2017 4 wuecp cpyield et 5 wueyield yield et 6 puecp cpyield pg where yield is for the grain of winter wheat and dry matter of forage crops respectively pg is the total precipitation during the crop growing season mm 2 5 3 economic analysis the economic analysis was conducted by calculating net income for the different rotation systems using production costs and crop prices obtained from the chinese national agricultural market service database http datacenter cngrain com for the experimental period 2011 2013 tables 2 and 3 the cost of sowing included labor seed and tillage and the cost of tillage included fuel repair and maintenance of the equipment additional production costs included urea and triple superphosphate fertilizers weed management and harvest the costs of weed management and harvest were labor net income of each crop rotation system was calculated as the difference between the gross income and production costs u s dollars 2 6 statistical analysis data was analyzed by analysis of variance at p 0 05 using genstat 17 0 software lawes agricultural trust roth amsted experimental station oxford uk replication and year were considered as random effects differences among means of rotation systems were compared using fisher s protected least significant difference test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 meteorological characteristics the long term average annual precipitation at the experimental site from 1961 to 2010 was 546 mm during the experimental years 10 and 26 more precipitation occurred in 2011 and 2013 compared with long term average value respectively while 14 less occurred in 2012 table 4 in 2012 the winter wheat growing season had 26 more precipitation than long term average 239 mm and precipitation during winter wheat growing season in 2013 228 mm was similar to the long term average precipitation in the forage crops growing season was 34 lower than the long term average 306 mm in 2012 and the value 332 mm was 8 higher than the long term average in 2011 during the experimental years monthly average air temperature ranged from 3 to 23 c fig 2 the overall average annual air temperature 11 c was consistent with the long term average 14 c the maximum monthly average air temperature occurred in july 3 2 the effects of forage crops on cpyield and yield significant differences appeared in cpyield of the rotation systems p 0 01 with the lowest value in the fwvw rotation system 1309 kg ha 1 and the greatest value in the rwrw rotation system 2833 kg ha 1 table 5 fig 3 replacing fallow with forage rape in 2011 improved the system cpyield by 40 averaged over the rwrw and rwvw rotation systems compared with the average of the fwrw and fwvw rotation systems the rwrw rotation system produced 15 35 42 and 50 more system cpyield than the rwvw fwrw fwfw and fwvw rotation systems respectively there was no rotation effect on cpyield and yield of forage rape in 2011 or forage rape and common vetch in 2012 fig 4 winter wheat cpyield and yield of grain exhibited significant interaction between rotation system and year p 0 01 table 5 the average cpyield and grain yield of the winter wheat over the fwvw fwrw and fwfw rotation systems was743 and 5534 kg ha 1 in 2012 respectively fig 4 the rotations with common vetch averaged over the fwvw and rwvw rotation systems produced 20 and 27 more winter wheat cpyield and grain yield than the rotations with forage rape averaged over the fwrw and rwrw rotation systems in 2013 respectively p 0 05 the fwfw rotation system produced 39 44 54 and 53 more winter wheat cpyield in 2013 than the fwvw rwvw fwrw and rwrw rotation systems respectively p 0 05 and the fwfw rotation system produced 37 41 55 and 55 more winter wheat grain yield in 2013 than the fwvw rwvw fwrw and rwrw rotation systems respectively p 0 05 3 3 the effects of forage crops on swss swsh and wue soil water storage at sowing swss of winter wheat and forage rape was affected by year p 0 01 table 6 rotation had no influence on the swss in each crop during the experimental period no significant difference was found in the soil water storage at harvest swsh in 2011 and 2012 fig 5 however in 2013 there was significant difference among the rotation systems in swsh p 0 05 the fwfw rotation system had the lower swsh of winter wheat 243 mm than other rotation systems there was no significant interaction effect between year and rotation system for swsh table 6 water use wu of winter wheat and forage rape was affected by year p 0 01 table 6 there was no rotational effect on wu in 2011 and 2012 fig 5 however in 2013 there was a significant difference in wu p 0 05 and the fwfw rotation system had the highest value for wu 371 mm fig 6 shows the volumetric water content distribution in the 0 200 cm soil profile at different sampling dates during experimental period soil water content in the 0 30 cm layer was around 15 at the beginning of the experiment on 25 july 2011 and that in the deeper layers was around 20 and there was no significant difference in soil water among treatments in each layer soil water content was increased after a summer fallow 25 july 2011 through 23 september 2011 which in the 0 30 cm was around 27 but the difference among treatments was still not significant in all of the layers there was also no significant difference in all of the layers at 4 july 2012 but soil water content in the 0 30 cm layer was reduced during winter wheat growing season a significant difference in soil water was found on 14 september 2012 and soil water content in the fwfw rotation system was significantly greater than that in other rotation systems in the 0 40 cm layer p 0 05 at harvest stage of winter wheat soil water content in the 0 30 cm layer was around 13 with no significant difference but soil water content was lower than other rotation systems below the 30 cm depth p 0 05 fig 7 presents water use efficiency of yield wueyield for each crop in the different rotation systems during the experimental period there was no rotational effect on wueyield for each crop in the whole test year and wueyield for forage rape was affected by year table 7 the average of wueyield for forage rape common vetch and winter wheat was 19 7 9 1 and 10 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively system water use efficiency of crude protein yield wuecp and precipitation use efficiency of crude protein yield puecp were significantly different and showed a similar trend among the rotation systems p 0 01 table 7 fig 8 the rwrw rotation system had the greatest wuecp 2 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was 36 42 20 and 15 greater than that of the fwfw fwvw rwvw and fwrw rotation systems respectively p 0 05 the puecp in the rwrw rotation system had the greatest value 2 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was 51 56 24 and 28 greater than that in the fwfw fwvw rwvw and fwrw rotation systems respectively p 0 05 3 4 the effects of forage crops on system net income significant differences in system net income occurred among the rotation systems p 0 05 table 8 system net income ranged from 1325 ha 1 with the fwrw rotation system to 2005 ha 1 with the fwfw rotation system the averaged system net income 1514 ha 1 over the rotation systems with forage crops rwrw and rwvw was 8 greater than that 1392 ha 1 over the rotation systems with fallow fwrw and fwvw the net income for the winter wheat 423 ha 1 with common vetch as the preceding crop averaged over the fwvw and rwvw rotation systems was 47 greater than the value of 225 ha 1 with forage rape as the preceding crop averaged over the fwrw and rwrw rotation systems in 2013 the net income of common vetch 64 ha 1 averaged over the fwvw and rwvw rotation systems was 65 lower than that 23 ha 1 over the fwrw and rwrw rotation systems in 2012 4 discussion as an important evaluation indicator to ensure the sustainability of water resources for crop rotation system soil water storage is crucial for crop establishment particularly in water limited environments zheng et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 soil water storage at sowing swss plays a critical role in crop production nielsen et al 2002 aiken et al 2013 nielsen et al 2017a has showed that subsequent winter wheat yield was reduced by 17 and the yield reduction was in response to a 47 mm reduction of swss in a wheat maize zea mays l triticale x triticosecale rimpaui wittm rotation system compared with that in a wheat maize fallow rotation system this was likely because triticale water use wu was not offset by precipitation between triticale harvest and winter wheat sowing in arid and semi arid areas precipitation during the fallow period is vital to replenish the depleted soil water and conserve water for the next crop in this study there was a similar result for subsequent winter wheat in 2013 as cpyield and grain yield were reduced by 46 and 47 respectively when summer fallow was replaced with forage rape and common vetch fig 4 it is worth noting that the reduction of subsequent winter wheat production was not caused by swss but was likely influenced by the soil profile water content in the shallow layer at sowing soil water in the 0 80 cm layer was mainly depleted by forage crops which resulted from precipitation in the summer fallow season in 2012 being 34 less than long term average so soil water was not well recharged fig 6 however in 2011 due to precipitation in the summer fallow season being 7 higher than the long term average fig 2 soil water was recharged rather than depleted under fallow fig 6 therefore replacing fallow with forage rape had no effect on swss cpyield and grain yield of subsequent winter wheat in 2012 fig 4 fig 5 furthermore there was no significant difference in the soil water storage at harvest swsh among rotation systems in 2011 and 2012 and the swsh of subsequent winter wheat in 2013 was improved when summer fallow was replaced with forage rape and common vetch fig 5 indicating that planting forage crops instead of summer fallow is a feasible way to maintain a sustainable farming system in the loess plateau and other places with similar climatic conditions li et al 2000 also showed that fallow crops such as common vetch and soybean glycine max l merr from early july to late september had little effect on soil water storage since their growth depended mainly on in season precipitation in this study the average subsequent winter wheat cpyield over the fwrw and rwrw rotation systems was 26 less than the average over the fwvw and rwvw rotation systems and the cpyield reduction was in response to a 30 mm reduction in wu in 2013 fig 4 fig 5 this was likely because crop wu was affected by the preceding crop in the rotation system nielsen and vigil 2018 in addition in this study crude protein yield and yield for each crop were affected by year with a similar trend fig 4 table 5 this was mainly because precipitation during the growing season fig 2 crude protein yield is the product of crude protein concentration and crop yield but there was no rotational effect on the crude protein concentration of winter wheat and forage crops in the study data not presented here knowledge on the distribution of roots is essential for consumptive use of water and nutrient uptake by crops lynch 2007 and a larger root system can make the crop more adapt to the semiarid environments due to the ability to take up more water available in deeper soil layers fageria 2004 liu et al 2012 reported that oilseed and legume crops had about 80 of root dry weight in the soil layer above 40 cm and that root weight density decreased substantially with soil depth in our study the water depletion characteristic was similar to the distribution of roots which mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm soil layers during the experimental period but also occurred in the 40 100 cm soil layers in water stress conditions fig 6 li et al 2000 reported that the water consuming depth for wheat was deeper than 1 m in a dry year in our study a similar result was found as there was a significant difference in soil profile water content below a depth of 40 cm in 2013 when summer fallow was replaced by forage crops fig 6 improving the pue is crucial to the sustainable development of agricultural production peterson et al 1996 compared with winter wheat monoculture all crop rotation can significantly increase the duration of crop coverage during the rainy season and system pue huang et al 2003 in the current study adding a forage crop to the rotation system in two seasons rwrw and rwvw in place of the fallow phase improved system puecp by 45 fig 8 the puecp improvement was in response to a 1354 kg ha 1 improvement in system cpyield and a 1543 kg ha 1 improvement in system forage cpyield fig 3 which indicates that the increase in system puecp resulted from the system forage cpyield improvement adding common vetch fwvw to the rotation system in just one season fwvw in place of the fallow phase did not alter the system puecp compared with the fwfw system but increased system puecp occurred by adding forage rape to the rotation system in one season fwrw fig 8 this was primary because common vetch cpyield 127 15 kg ha 1 in the fwvw rotation system was 82 less than that of forage rape 737 29 kg ha 1 in the fwrw rotation system in a growing season with 210 mm precipitation fig 2 fig 4 nielsen and vigil 2017balso reported that replacing a fallow phase with pea pisum sativum l in 4 yr rotation did not alter system pue of dry matter due to reductions in wheat and maize dry matter that were a result of lower swss due to pea production which were compensated by pea production higher water productivity or efficiency is an important criterion for selecting sustainable rotation systems for water limited environments neal et al 2011 previous studies have examined wue of dry matter in the loess plateau deng et al 2006 jin et al 2007 in the current study the differences in system wue of dry matter among crop rotation systems was less evident when summer fallow was replaced with forage crops fig s1 however the wuecp in rotation systems with forage crops was higher than that in the fwfw rotation system fig 8 which was mainly related to crop production miller et al 2001 nielsen and vigil 2017breported that it is not appropriate to directly compare system yield between a fwfw rotation system and a rotation consists of grains and forage crop in the current study rotation systems with forage crops resulted in greater system cpyield when compared to the fwfw rotation system the greatest system cpyield 2833 kg ha 1 occurred with the rwrw rotation system and there was no significant difference between the fwfw and fwvw rotation systems this was likely because adding one season of common vetch in 2012 113 95 kg ha 1 to the fwfw rotation system was able to offset the cpyield reduction of subsequent winter wheat in 2013 246 98 kg ha 1 fig 3 in contrast the system net income was lower in rotation systems with forage crops table 8 this was likely due to differences in the market price between winter wheat and forage crops as the average price for winter wheat and forage crops price forage rape and common vetch was 0 289 and 0 115 kg 1 respectively across the experimental years table 2 similarly when compared to a winter wheat fallow rotation system nielsen et al 2016 showed that system net income was reduced by 72 ha 1 yr 1 when fallow was replaced with millet setaria italic l and attributed this to high year to year variability in forage produced in the continuously cropping system however system net income in the rwvw rotation system was 11 more than that in the rwrw rotation system and system net income in the fwvw rotation system was 9 more than that in the fwrw rotation system table 8 this was primary because the grain yield of winter wheat with common vetch as the preceding crop was 33 higher than that with forage rape as the preceding crop fig 4 and because the market price of winter wheat was 42 higher than that of common vetch table 2 so the net income generated by winter wheat production was able to compensate the economic loss caused by the production of common vetch similar results was reported by lyon et al 2004 who found that system net income was improved when fallow was replaced with pea forage production but net income was greatly reduced when fallow was replaced with canola brassica napus l they attributed this to an earlier harvest date for forage pea resulting in a longer soil water recharge period prior to wheat sowing however nielsen et al 2016 reported that although greater net income could be achieved by a continuous grain forage cropping system compared with a fallow grain rotation system use of forages in dryland cropping systems is not widespread because the factors influencing system net income are complex and may include greater labor requirements transportation costs and market challenges for forage production in the current study the net income generated by forage production was negative especially for common vetch table 8 and this was primary because there was an unequal relationship between economic input and output in forage crop production therefore farmers should be aware of the risks of crop annual forage rotation systems associated with variation in market prices and growing season precipitation when summer fallow is replaced by forage rape and common vetch considering the impact of precipitation variability a long term crop rotation experiment needs to be conducted to better understand these risks and the growing environments that are best suited for specific rotation systems 5 conclusions inserting forage rape and common vetch into a fallow winter wheat rotation system i e fwfw could increase the summer july through september puecp and wuecp by 20 and 28 respectively replacing fallow with an annual forage crop could improve cpyield of rotation systems to support livestock production compared with the fwfw rotation system rotation systems with forage crops increased cpyield by an average of 31 and the rwrw increased cpyield by 51 however rotation system with forage crops decreased net income by 25 compared with the fwfw rotation system due to the failure of the net income generated by forage production to offset the reduction in net income resulting from lower yield of the subsequent winter wheat however rotation system with forage crops could effectively increase cpyield by improving wue and water storage compared to fwfw rotation system in a semi arid environment the index of wuecp might be more appropriate than wuedm when evaluating the performance in animal husbandry production of crop annual forage rotation system consequently we recommend an alternate rotation system of fwfw and rwrw for local farmers when considering both

10751,diversifying the summer fallow f winter wheat triticum aestivum l w cropping system by replacing summer fallow with forage crops could increase forage yield and precipitation use efficiency in the loess plateau region of china however its influence on protein productivity is unclear and it is unknown whether improvement in protein productivity will increase soil water extraction and economic input a three year 2011 2013 field experiment was conducted to investigate the rotational effect on system productivity economic benefit and sustainability when summer fallow was replaced with forage rape brassica napus l r and common vetch vicia sativa l v results showed that the rotation system with forage crops did not alter soil water storage of subsequent winter wheat compared with the fwfw rotation system the rotation system with forage crops improved precipitation use efficiency of crude protein yield puecp and system water use efficiency of crude protein yield wuecp by 20 and 28 respectively the greatest crude protein productivity cpyield was achieved with the rwrw rotation system followed by the fwrw and rwvw systems and cpyield with these systems was 51 21 and 36 greater than that with the fwfw system respectively p 0 05 in contrast net income in the fwfw rotation system had the greatest value u s 2 005 ha 1 27 20 34 and 29 greater than that in the fwvw rwvw fwrw and rwrw systems respectively p 0 05 consequently the alternate rotation system of fwfw and rwrw is recommended for local farmers when considering both profitability and sustainability keywords summer fallow annual forage water use yield net income rainfed farming systems 1 introduction water is the primary limiting factor for agriculture and forage production in the rainfed regions in the loess plateau of northwestern china ding et al 2018 li et al 2018 traditionally winter wheat triticum aestivum l monoculture has been a popular cropping practice in this region karlen et al 1994 summer fallow is usually used to lower the risk of loss in crop production by abandoning production in one season to guarantee crop productive potential of the next season nielsen and vigil 2010 and reduce material and energy input greb 1979 however previous studies have reported that summer fallowing had a negative impact on the environment unger et al 1997 farahani et al 1998 there were more weeds growing in the field during the fallow period which increased chemical input norwood and dhuyvetter 1993 more importantly the summer fallow period decreases system water use efficiency wue and precipitation use efficiency pue kang et al 2001 resulting in a substantial waste of water therefore it is necessary to explore suitable cropping systems to improve crop and forage production planting cover crops in the summer fallow period has been an effective technique to guarantee both crop and forage production gardner 1993 thorup kristensen et al 2003 garcia et al 2008 which increased crop productivity potential and pue peterson and westfall 2015 li et al 2002 nielsen and vigil 2005reported that reducing the fallow frequency with legume crops generally resulted in higher wheat yield and forage production which was attributed to greater amounts of surface crop residues remaining nielsen and calderÃ³n 2011reported that replacing a summer fallow period with a cover crop could increase pue by 17 while kaan et al 2002 found that the use of cover crops increased economic net income by 36 therefore it is particularly urgent to select suitable cover crops for local crop and forage production with the characteristics of rapid growth and flexible usage during the growing season annual forage crops with high quality that are considered to be ideal candidates to diversify and optimize local farming systems include common vetch vicia sativa l and forage rape brassica napus l abate et al 2003 reported that planting forage vetch in a short fallow period could increase forage yield by 2 0 t ha 1 and that forage rape as an annual forage produced relatively large amounts of forage in the short term liu et al 2014 furthermore planting forage as cover crops could also produce considerable crude protein yield cpyield due to common vetch and forage rape having high protein content zhang et al 2018 reported that legumes had higher crude protein cp concentration and produced equivalent or greater cpyield compared to the grasses forage rape has high crude protein concentration which is similar to that of legume crops yang et al 2003 although planting forages as cover crops in the summer fallow period could effectively promote forage production it has a potential risk on sustainability if the availability of soil water and precipitation cannot meet crop demand in addition since cp is an important evaluation indicator for forage quality as well as livestock production coleman and moore 2003 it is necessary to evaluate the production and wue of crude protein yield wuecp for selecting suitable cropping systems to resolve the high quality forage feed deficit for local sustainable livestock production in the loess plateau of china however previous research in this region has primarily focused on crop biomass and less attention has been given to cp production plaza bonilla et al 2017 only gan et al 2015 reported that eliminating summer fallow with forage crops could enhance system cpyield by 18 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the sustainability of crop rotation systems by comparing soil water storage at sowing and harvest for each crop in all rotation systems 2 investigate the variation of wuecp and precipitation use efficiency puecp among rotation systems when summer fallow was replaced with forage crops and 3 evaluate change of cpyield and net income in the different rotation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description this field study was conducted at the loess plateau research station of lanzhou

wheat rwvw summer fallow winter wheat forage rape winter wheat fwrw and forage rape winter wheat forage rape winter wheat rwrw fig 1 the experiment was conducted by using a randomized complete block design with four replications 2 3 crop and field management the experiment was conducted in a rainfed farming system with a plot area of 20 m2 4 m 5 m the distance between adjacent plots was 1 m all plots were moldboard plowed to a depth of 30 cm followed by harrowing and culti packing just prior to sowing details regarding the crop cultivars sowing and fertilization are provided in table 1 winter wheat common vetch and forage rape seeds were sown by hand at a rate of 225 120 and 15 kg ha 1 respectively winter wheat and common vetch were sown at 30 mm depth using a drill while forage rape seed was surface broadcast winter wheat and common vetch were sown with 15 and 20 cm row spacing respectively at sowing fertilization included the application of 225 kg ha 1 of triple superphosphate for all species and 150 kg ha 1 urea at the regreening stage for winter wheat and at the sowing stage for forage rape based on local practices table 1 weeds were controlled manually during the growing season 2 4 data collection and measurement 2 4 1 meteorological condition air temperature and precipitation were recorded daily using a pc200w automatic meteorological station campbell scientific placed within 50 m of the experimental field 2 4 2 crop yield and n content of crop winter wheat was sampled at physiological maturity from three randomly placed quadrats within each plot to calculate grain yield each quadrat covered a 1 m length of two rows and had an area of 0 3 m2 forage rape and common vetch were harvested when approximately 50 of the plants were in the flowering stage from three randomly placed quadrats 1 1 m within each plot to determine forage yield for all crops a distance of at least 50 cm was left between sampling areas all samples were oven dried at 80 c to a constant weight prior to calculation of yield and subsequent analysis of n concentration which was determined using the kjeldahl method bremner 1965 2 4 3 soil water content soil water content was measured using the gravimetric method in each plot at sowing and harvest of each crop in all years during 2011 2013 soil samples were collected in 10 cm increments in the 0 30 cm soil layer in 30 cm increments in the 30 150 cm soil layer and in a 50 cm increment for the 150 200 cm soil layer the samples were oven dried at 105 c for 48 h to determine soil water content soil water storage sws mm was calculated using the following equation dam et al 2005 1 sws h w b 10 where sws is soil water storage mm h is the thickness of a measured soil layer cm w is the mass soil water content of a given soil layer g g 1 and b is soil bulk density of a given soil layer g cm 3 2 5 indicator calculation 2 5 1 cpyield crude protein concentration was calculated by multiplying the n concentration by 6 25 horwitz 1980 tian et al 2012 crude protein yield was calculated using the following equation 2 cpyield y cpc where cpyield is the yield of crude protein kg ha 1 y is crop yield winter wheat grain yield at maturity and forage yield at the flowering stage kg ha 1 and cpc is crude protein concentration of the crop grain cpc for winter wheat at maturity and whole plant cpc for forage at the flowering stage g g 1 2 5 2 wue and pue seasonal evapotranspiration et mm was calculated for each growing season using the field water balance equation lenssen et al 2007 huang et al 2005 shen et al 2009 3 et p s r dp cr where p is the total seasonal precipitation mm s is the change in stored soil water of the soil profile mm from sowing to harvest r is surface runoff mm dp is the deep percolation of the soil water in the root zone mm and cr is the capillary rise of water surface runoff was not considered since the experimental site had a flat topography deep percolation of soil water was neglected in our calculations since we assumed that precipitation water rarely infiltrated to the depth of 200 cm in the short term the groundwater table of the experimental field is approximately 50 m below the surface so cr to the root was considered negligible water use efficiency kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated for cpyield wuecp yield wueyield and precipitation use efficiency kg

crops respectively pg is the total precipitation during the crop growing season mm 2 5 3 economic analysis the economic analysis was conducted by calculating net income for the different rotation systems using production costs and crop prices obtained from the chinese national agricultural market service database http datacenter cngrain com for the experimental period 2011 2013 tables 2 and 3 the cost of sowing included labor seed and tillage and the cost of tillage included fuel repair and maintenance of the equipment additional production costs included urea and triple superphosphate fertilizers weed management and harvest the costs of weed management and harvest were labor net income of each crop rotation system was calculated as the difference between the gross income and production costs u s dollars 2 6 statistical analysis data was analyzed by analysis of variance at p 0 05 using genstat 17 0 software lawes agricultural trust roth amsted experimental station oxford uk replication and year were considered as random effects differences among means of rotation systems were compared using fisher s protected least significant difference test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 meteorological characteristics the long term average annual precipitation at the experimental site from 1961 to 2010 was 546 mm during the experimental years 10 and 26 more precipitation occurred in 2011 and 2013 compared with long term average value respectively while 14 less occurred in 2012 table 4 in 2012 the winter wheat growing season had 26 more precipitation than long term average 239 mm and precipitation during winter wheat growing season in 2013 228 mm was similar to the long term average precipitation in the forage crops growing season was 34 lower than the long term average 306 mm in 2012 and the value 332 mm was 8 higher than the long term average in 2011 during the experimental years monthly average air temperature ranged from 3 to 23 c fig 2 the overall average annual air temperature 11 c was consistent with the long term average 14 c the maximum monthly average air temperature occurred in july 3 2 the effects of forage crops on cpyield and yield significant differences appeared in cpyield of the rotation systems p 0 01 with the lowest value in the fwvw rotation system 1309 kg ha 1 and the greatest value in the rwrw rotation system 2833 kg ha 1 table 5 fig 3 replacing fallow with forage rape in 2011 improved the system cpyield by 40 averaged over the rwrw and rwvw rotation systems compared with the average of the fwrw and fwvw rotation systems the rwrw rotation system produced 15 35 42 and 50 more system cpyield than the rwvw fwrw fwfw and fwvw rotation systems respectively there was no rotation effect on cpyield and yield of forage rape in 2011 or forage rape and common vetch in 2012 fig 4 winter wheat cpyield and yield of grain exhibited significant interaction between rotation system and year p 0 01 table 5 the average cpyield and grain yield of the winter wheat over the fwvw fwrw and fwfw rotation systems was743 and 5534 kg ha 1 in 2012 respectively fig 4 the rotations with common vetch averaged over the fwvw and rwvw rotation systems produced 20 and 27 more winter wheat cpyield and grain yield than the rotations with forage rape averaged over the fwrw and rwrw rotation systems in 2013 respectively p 0 05 the fwfw rotation system produced 39 44 54 and 53 more winter wheat cpyield in 2013 than the fwvw rwvw fwrw and rwrw rotation systems respectively p 0 05 and the fwfw rotation system produced 37 41 55 and 55 more winter wheat grain yield in 2013 than the fwvw rwvw fwrw and rwrw rotation systems respectively p 0 05 3 3 the effects of forage crops on swss swsh and wue soil water storage at sowing swss of winter wheat and forage rape was affected by year p 0 01 table 6 rotation had no influence on the swss in each crop during the experimental period no significant difference was found in the soil water storage at harvest swsh in 2011 and 2012 fig 5 however in 2013 there was significant difference among the rotation systems in swsh p 0 05 the fwfw rotation system had the lower swsh of winter wheat 243 mm than other rotation systems there was no significant interaction effect between year and rotation system for swsh table 6 water use wu of winter wheat and forage rape was affected by year p 0 01 table 6 there was no rotational effect on wu in 2011 and 2012 fig 5 however in 2013 there was a significant difference in wu p 0 05 and the fwfw rotation system had the highest value for wu 371 mm fig 6 shows the volumetric water content distribution in the 0 200 cm soil profile at different sampling dates during experimental period soil water content in the 0 30 cm layer was around 15 at the beginning of the experiment on 25 july 2011 and that in the deeper layers was around 20 and there was no significant difference in soil water among treatments in each layer soil water content was increased after a summer fallow 25 july 2011 through 23 september 2011 which in the 0 30 cm was around 27 but the difference among treatments was still not significant in all of the layers there was also no significant difference in all of the layers at 4 july 2012 but soil water content in the 0 30 cm layer was reduced during winter wheat growing season a significant difference in soil water was found on 14 september 2012 and soil water content in the fwfw rotation system was significantly greater than that in other rotation systems in the 0 40 cm layer p 0 05 at harvest stage of winter wheat soil water content in the 0 30 cm layer was around 13 with no significant difference but soil water content was lower than other rotation systems below the 30 cm depth p 0 05 fig 7 presents water use efficiency of yield wueyield for each crop in the different rotation systems during the experimental period there was no rotational effect on wueyield for each crop in the whole test year and wueyield for forage rape was affected by year table 7 the average of wueyield for forage rape common vetch and winter wheat was 19 7 9 1 and 10 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively system water use efficiency of crude protein yield wuecp and precipitation use efficiency of crude protein yield puecp were significantly different and showed a similar trend among the rotation systems p 0 01 table 7 fig 8 the rwrw rotation system had the greatest wuecp 2 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was 36 42 20 and 15 greater than that of the fwfw fwvw rwvw and fwrw rotation systems respectively p 0 05 the puecp in the rwrw rotation system had the greatest value 2 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 which was 51 56 24 and 28 greater than that in the fwfw fwvw rwvw and fwrw rotation systems respectively p 0 05 3 4 the effects of forage crops on system net income significant differences in system net income occurred among the rotation systems p 0 05 table 8 system net income ranged from 1325 ha 1 with the fwrw rotation system to 2005 ha 1 with the fwfw rotation system the averaged system net income 1514 ha 1 over the rotation systems with forage crops rwrw and rwvw was 8 greater than that 1392 ha 1 over the rotation systems with fallow fwrw and fwvw the net income for the winter wheat 423 ha 1 with common vetch as the preceding crop averaged over the fwvw and rwvw rotation systems was 47 greater than the value of 225 ha 1 with forage rape as the preceding crop averaged over the fwrw and rwrw rotation systems in 2013 the net income of common vetch 64 ha 1 averaged over the fwvw and rwvw rotation systems was 65 lower than that 23 ha 1 over the fwrw and rwrw rotation systems in 2012 4 discussion as an important evaluation indicator to ensure the sustainability of water resources for crop rotation system soil water storage is crucial for crop establishment particularly in water limited environments zheng et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 soil water storage at sowing swss plays a critical role in crop production nielsen et al 2002 aiken et al 2013 nielsen et al 2017a has showed that subsequent winter wheat yield was reduced by 17 and the yield reduction was in response to a 47 mm reduction of swss in a wheat maize zea mays l triticale x triticosecale rimpaui wittm rotation system compared with that in a wheat maize fallow rotation system this was likely because triticale water use wu was not offset by precipitation between triticale harvest and winter wheat sowing in arid and semi arid areas precipitation during the fallow period is vital to replenish the depleted soil water and conserve water for the next crop in this study there was a similar result for subsequent winter wheat in 2013 as cpyield and grain yield were reduced by 46 and 47 respectively when summer fallow was replaced with forage rape and common vetch fig 4 it is worth noting that the reduction of subsequent winter wheat production was not caused by swss but was likely influenced by the soil profile water content in the shallow layer at sowing soil water in the 0 80 cm layer was mainly depleted by forage crops which resulted from precipitation in the summer fallow season in 2012 being 34 less than long term average so soil water was not well recharged fig 6 however in 2011 due to precipitation in the summer fallow season being 7 higher than the long term average fig 2 soil water was recharged rather than depleted under fallow fig 6 therefore replacing fallow with forage rape had no effect on swss cpyield and grain yield of subsequent winter wheat in 2012 fig 4 fig 5 furthermore there was no significant difference in the soil water storage at harvest swsh among rotation systems in 2011 and 2012 and the swsh of subsequent winter wheat in 2013 was improved when summer fallow was replaced with forage rape and common vetch fig 5 indicating that planting forage crops instead of summer fallow is a feasible way to maintain a sustainable farming system in the loess plateau and other places with similar climatic conditions li et al 2000 also showed that fallow crops such as common vetch and soybean glycine max l merr from early july to late september had little effect on soil water storage since their growth depended mainly on in season precipitation in this study the average subsequent winter wheat cpyield over the fwrw and rwrw rotation systems was 26 less than the average over the fwvw and rwvw rotation systems and the cpyield reduction was in response to a 30 mm reduction in wu in 2013 fig 4 fig 5 this was likely because crop wu was affected by the preceding crop in the rotation system nielsen and vigil 2018 in addition in this study crude protein yield and yield for each crop were affected by year with a similar trend fig 4 table 5 this was mainly because precipitation during the growing season fig 2 crude protein yield is the product of crude protein concentration and crop yield but there was no rotational effect on the crude protein concentration of winter wheat and forage crops in the study data not presented here knowledge on the distribution of roots is essential for consumptive use of water and nutrient uptake by crops lynch 2007 and a larger root system can make the crop more adapt to the semiarid environments due to the ability to take up more water available in deeper soil layers fageria 2004 liu et al 2012 reported that oilseed and legume crops had about 80 of root dry weight in the soil layer above 40 cm and that root weight density decreased substantially with soil depth in our study the water depletion characteristic was similar to the distribution of roots which mainly occurred in the 0 40 cm soil layers during the experimental period but also occurred in the 40 100 cm soil layers in water stress conditions fig 6 li et al 2000 reported that the water consuming depth for wheat was deeper than 1 m in a dry year in our study a similar result was found as there was a significant difference in soil profile water content below a depth of 40 cm in 2013 when summer fallow was replaced by forage crops fig 6 improving the pue is crucial to the sustainable development of agricultural production peterson et al 1996 compared with winter wheat monoculture all crop rotation can significantly increase the duration of crop coverage during the rainy season and system pue huang et al 2003 in the current study adding a forage crop to the rotation system in two seasons rwrw and rwvw in place of the fallow phase improved system puecp by 45 fig 8 the puecp improvement was in response to a 1354 kg ha 1 improvement in system cpyield and a 1543 kg ha 1 improvement in system forage cpyield fig 3 which indicates that the increase in system puecp resulted from the system forage cpyield improvement adding common vetch fwvw to the rotation system in just one season fwvw in place of the fallow phase did not alter the system puecp compared with the fwfw system but increased system puecp occurred by adding forage rape to the rotation system in one season fwrw fig 8 this was primary because common vetch cpyield 127 15 kg ha 1 in the fwvw rotation system was 82 less than that of forage rape 737 29 kg ha 1 in the fwrw rotation system in a growing season with 210 mm precipitation fig 2 fig 4 nielsen and vigil 2017balso reported that replacing a fallow phase with pea pisum sativum l in 4 yr rotation did not alter system pue of dry matter due to reductions in wheat and maize dry matter that were a result of lower swss due to pea production which were compensated by pea production higher water productivity or efficiency is an important criterion for selecting sustainable rotation systems for water limited environments neal et al 2011 previous studies have examined wue of dry matter in the loess plateau deng et al 2006 jin et al 2007 in the current study the differences in system wue of dry matter among crop rotation systems was less evident when summer fallow was replaced with forage crops fig s1 however the wuecp in rotation systems with forage crops was higher than that in the fwfw rotation system fig 8 which was mainly related to crop production miller et al 2001 nielsen and vigil 2017breported that it is not appropriate to directly compare system yield between a fwfw rotation system and a rotation consists of grains and forage crop in the current study rotation systems with forage crops resulted in greater system cpyield when compared to the fwfw rotation system the greatest system cpyield 2833 kg ha 1 occurred with the rwrw rotation system and there was no significant difference between the fwfw and fwvw rotation systems this was likely because adding one season of common vetch in 2012 113 95 kg ha 1 to the fwfw rotation system was able to offset the cpyield reduction of subsequent winter wheat in 2013 246 98 kg ha 1 fig 3 in contrast the system net income was lower in rotation systems with forage crops table 8 this was likely due to differences in the market price between winter wheat and forage crops as the average price for winter wheat and forage crops price forage rape and common vetch was 0 289 and 0 115 kg 1 respectively across the experimental years table 2 similarly when compared to a winter wheat fallow rotation system nielsen et al 2016 showed that system net income was reduced by 72 ha 1 yr 1 when fallow was replaced with millet setaria italic l and attributed this to high year to year variability in forage produced in the continuously cropping system however system net income in the rwvw rotation system was 11 more than that in the rwrw rotation system and system net income in the fwvw rotation system was 9 more than that in the fwrw rotation system table 8 this was primary because the grain yield of winter wheat with common vetch as the preceding crop was 33 higher than that with forage rape as the preceding crop fig 4 and because the market price of winter wheat was 42 higher than that of common vetch table 2 so the net income generated by winter wheat production was able to compensate the economic loss caused by the production of common vetch similar results was reported by lyon et al 2004 who found that system net income was improved when fallow was replaced with pea forage production but net income was greatly reduced when fallow was replaced with canola brassica napus l they attributed this to an earlier harvest date for forage pea resulting in a longer soil water recharge period prior to wheat sowing however nielsen et al 2016 reported that although greater net income could be achieved by a continuous grain forage cropping system compared with a fallow grain rotation system use of forages in dryland cropping systems is not widespread because the factors influencing system net income are complex and may include greater labor requirements transportation costs and market challenges for forage production in the current study the net income generated by forage production was negative especially for common vetch table 8 and this was primary because there was an unequal relationship between economic input and output in forage crop production therefore farmers should be aware of the risks of crop annual forage rotation systems associated with variation in market prices and growing season precipitation when summer fallow is replaced by forage rape and common vetch considering the impact of precipitation variability a long term crop rotation experiment needs to be conducted to better understand these risks and the growing environments that are best suited for specific rotation systems 5 conclusions inserting forage rape and common vetch into a fallow winter wheat rotation system i e fwfw could increase the summer july through september puecp and wuecp by 20 and 28 respectively replacing fallow with an annual forage crop could improve cpyield of rotation systems to support livestock production compared with the fwfw rotation system rotation systems with forage crops increased cpyield by an average of 31 and the rwrw increased cpyield by 51 however rotation system with forage crops decreased net income by 25 compared with the fwfw rotation system due to the failure of the net income generated by forage production to offset the reduction in net income resulting from lower yield of the subsequent winter wheat however rotation system with forage crops could effectively increase cpyield by improving wue and water storage compared to fwfw rotation system in a semi arid environment the index of wuecp might be more appropriate than wuedm when evaluating the

10752,spring maize is one of the major cereal crops in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china but limited water resources and low water fertilizer use efficiency largely restrict the sustainable development of local agriculture a two year ï¬eld experiment was conducted to explore the effects of water fertilizer interaction on aboveground biomass grain yield crop water productivity cwp partial factor productivity pfp and economic benefits of spring maize particularly the optimized combination of drip irrigation and fertilization regimes for high grain yield cwp and economic benefits were attained by multiple regression analysis and likelihood estimation the irrigation levels included i60 60 etc etc is the crop evapotranspiration i75 i90 and i105 in 2015 and i60 i80 i100 and i120 in 2016 the n p2o5 k2o fertilization levels kg ha 1 consisted of f60 60 30 30 f120 120 60 60 f180 180 90 90 and f240 240 120 120 corresponding to low medium medium high and normal high fertilization rates respectively aboveground biomass grain yield cwp pfp and net returns generally increased as irrigation and fertilization amount increased except for that cwp and pfp constantly decreased with increasing irrigation and fertilizer amounts respectively there were significant interaction effects on these indexes in both years the highest yields were 18 81 mg ha 1 at i105f180 and 20 53 mg ha 1 at i100f180 the highest cwp were 3 32 kg m 3 at i90f180 and 3 99 kg m 3 at i100f180 and the highest net returns were 17 482 cny ha 1 at i105f180 and 20 174 cny ha 1 at i100f180 in 2015 and 2016 respectively maize yield cwp and net returns reached 95 of their maximum values simultaneously when irrigation amount ranged 93 126 etc and fertilizer n p2o5 k2o amount ranged 124 62 62 228 114 114 kg ha 1 the overall benefits of maize yield cwp and net returns were finally maximized with irrigation amount of 109 etc 474 mm and medium high fertilizer n p2o5 k2o amount of 184 92 92 kg ha 1 this study can provide a guideline for appropriate water and fertilizer management for sustainable spring maize production in the semi arid region of northwest china keywords drip fertigation spring maize grain yield crop water productivity partial factor productivity economic benefits 1 introduction the maize planting area in china has exceeded 35 45 mha no 1 globally while the annual production is 2 18 pg and accounts for 22 0 of the world s total production but this is still 13 4 less than that in the united states fao 2016 therefore a huge potential in yield increase is possible for maize production in china liu and zhang 2007 xiong et al 2010 zheng et al 2018a in 2020 the food production in china should exceed 5 50 pg of which maize accounts for 53 1 hence crop yields per unit of water and land must be further improved however sustainable food production is limited by various factors such as climate irrigation and fertilization maize is one of the major cereal crops planted in the arid and semi arid areas of northwest china guo et al 2009 piao et al 2010 tao and zhang 2011 in 2017 the maize planting area in these regions reached 3 58 mha accounting for 12 5 of the national maize planting area china national bureau of statistics previous studies have showed that crop yields can be effectively improved by optimizing water and fertilization management elhendawy and schmidhalter 2010 mueller et al 2012 wang et al 2018 yan et al 2019 in practice however farmers tend to choose over irrigation and over fertilization to maximize grain yields based on their experiences which actually results in decreased use efficiency of water and fertilizer and reduced economic efficiency owing to the recent rapid agricultural modernization in china drip fertigation has been widely applied in agricultural production wang et al 2014 fan et al 2017 wang et al 2019 this technology can increase crop yields and significantly improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizers marra et al 2003 gheysari et al 2015 fan et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 in the arid areas of northwest china water is the limiting factor for agricultural production and cwp needs to be continuously improved the effects of irrigation amount on maize yield popova and pereira 2011 ma et al 2012 water productivity payero et al 2009 kafetzis et al 2010 and economic returns rodrigues and pereira 2009 abdel wahed and ali 2012 domÃ­nguez et al 2012 sihlongonyane et al 2014 have been well assessed for instance rodrigues et al 2013 evaluated the effects of irrigation amount on maize production in terms of economic efficiency and cwp they found that adequate irrigation led to high maize yields and economic benefits but it reduced cwp brennan 2008 claimed that the amount of irrigation water required could be reduced by increasing the capital expenditure on equipment thus balancing the economic benefits therefore an optimized irrigation regime that balances crop water productivity fertilization efficiency and maize production is highly required to optimize the economic benefits with limited water resources kampas et al 2012 montero et al 2012 khan et al 2009 and fan et al 2005 claimed that crop productivity can be significantly enhanced by increasing fertilization amount despite the key role of fertilizers in food security over application of chemical fertilizers may lead to a decline in crop production balasubramanian et al 1998 zheng et al 2017 accelerated acidification of farmland guo et al 2010 increased greenhouse gas emissions smil 1999 damages to water quality and aquatic eco systems and thus decline economic returns diaz and rosenberg 2008 an appropriate combination of irrigation and fertilizer management can increase

nitrogen leaching through optimization of farm management zhang et al 2017a investigated the single factor effects marginal effects and interaction effects of nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer potash fertilizer and irrigation amount on the photosynthetic rate of maize based on a quadruple quadratic regression model it was found that the most suitable combination of irrigation water and fertilizer amounts was as follows irrigation amount of 700 m3 ha 1 and the fertilizer amounts of 270 0 kg ha 1 n 60 26 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 60 02 kg ha 1 k2o as the relatively high maize production level in china is resulted from high consumption high costs and high environmental pollution the development of sustainable agriculture in china has been severely limited the single objective optimization of water and fertilizer use efficiency grain yield and economic efficiency is usually not enough for sustainable agricultural development an effective irrigation and fertilization scheduling is urgently needed to guarantee sufficient food production good environmental protection and increased farmer income spring maize is a main crop in the arid and semi arid region of northwest china where the maize yield accounts for about 10 of the national production although previous studies have optimized water supply and fertilizer input for maximized maize production cwp pfp or net returns few studies have focused on the optimal management of water and fertilizer that can comprehensively improve grain yield cwp pfp and economic benefits of spring maize in this study quantitative correlations between aboveground biomass grain yield cwp pfp and net returns against water and fertilizer inputs were established to obtain an optimized water and fertilizer management strategy for spring maize yield in northwest china its economic efficiency water and fertilizer use efficiency based on multiple regression analysis and likelihood estimation 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental plots field experiments were conducted during the growing seasons of spring maize april to september in 2015 and 2016 at the agricultural and ecological water saving experimental station of china agricultural university 37 50 n 102 51 e on the edge of the tengger desert with an altitude of 1584 m the local arid climate is continental with an annual average temperature of 8 c the total precipitation at the experimental site during the spring maize growth season was 141 mm in 2015 and the corresponding value was 115 mm in 2016 however the total amounts of effective rainfall events 5 mm were 120 mm in 2015 and 86 mm in 2016 the soil in the 0 1 2 m layer was characterized as clay soil with an average soil bulk density of 1 52 g cm 3 water holding capacity of 32 9 volumetric water content and saturated water content of 42 6 the soil contained 50 3 mg kg 1 alkaline hydrolysable nitrogen 3 82 mg kg 1 effective phosphorus and 8 9 g kg 1 organic matter with a ph of 8 22 the groundwater used for irrigation was extracted from a depth of 40 m with a mineralization degree of 0 71 g l 1 2 2 experimental design the spring maize variety qiangsheng 51 shanxi qiangsheng seeds co ltd was tested in the present study the applied fertilizers were urea phosphate and potassium sulphate according to local practice transparent polyethylene film was used as cover film with a width of 1 2 m and a thickness of 8 Î¼m the drip fertilization equipment consisted of water source water pump proportional fertilizer pump and pipeline system for water transport and distribution the drip irrigation belt was patch type with a dripper spacing of 0 2 m a dripper flow rate of 2 3 l h 1 and a working pressure of 0 2 mpa four irrigation levels including 60 75 90 and 105 of etc i60 i75 i90 and i105 respectively were used in 2015 however it was found that maize yield continued to increase with increasing irrigation level until i105 in 2015 therefore the four irrigation levels were further increased to i60 i80 i100 and i120 in 2016 to verify if near 100 etc was best for maize production etc was the actual crop evapotranspiration mm m 2 d 1 1 e t c e t 0 k c where kc is the maize crop coefficient which was selected as 0 7 at the seeding stage 1 2 at the jointing stage to grain filling stage and 0 6 at the milky to maturity stage allen et al 1998 and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm m 2 d 1 calculated according to the fao penman monteith equation fan et al 2018 the variations of meteorological variables during the two seasons are shown in fig s1 the sixteen treatments were replicated three times in a randomized complete factorial block design the experimental plots had a length of 6 m and a width of 5 m including 11 maize rows in the length direction of the plot with a plant spacing of 0 2 m wide 0 8 m and narrow 0 4 m rows were alternated one drip irrigation belt located in the middle of the narrow rows with a distance of 0 2 m from each row was used to irrigate the 50 maize plants in two maize rows each dripper corresponded to two maize plants and the maize plant density was 76 500 91 8 emergence rate plants per ha more planting details are shown in fig s2 the maize was irrigated at 10 day intervals but the date of irrigation was postponed to the next day in case of rainfall etc used to calculate irrigation amount during each event was the sum of daily etc during the 10 days before irrigation the actual irrigation amount excluded the water loss in irrigation pipelines and the coefficient of irrigation water use was taken as 0 95 wu et al 2014 in 2015 the initial soil water content of the experimental plots was high so no irrigation water was applied for seedling emergence irrigation was started when maize plants had three leaves and ended in both years 15 20 days before harvest four fertilization levels of n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 were applied as low medium medium high and normal high fertilization rates i e f60 60 30 30 f120 120 60 60 f180 180 90 90 and f240 240 120 120 therefore a total of 16 treatments were tested in triplicate maize plants were fertilized on four occasions along with drip irrigation based on their growth condition as shown in fig s3 20 of fertilizers at the seeding stage may 13rd 2015 and may 17th 2016 30 at the six leaf collar stage june 12th 2015 and june 6th 2016 30 at the tasseling stage july 5th 2015 and july 7th 2016 and 20 at the grain filling stage july 24th 2015 and july 37th 2016 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 soil water content soil samples were collected before irrigation and two days after irrigation using a soil auger starting from the middle point of two drippers on one drip irrigation belt soil samples were collected at 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 6 m distances to the drip irrigation belt the soil layers were 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 0 8 1 0 and 1 0 1 2 m three replicates were conducted at each sampling location soil samples were dried at 105 c until their weights were constant and soil water content was calculated by the weight difference of fresh and dried soils the average weight of three replicates was used 2 3 2 aboveground biomass four maize plants were randomly selected from each plot and cut off from the base of the stem at the seeding six collars twelve collars tasseling filling milky and maturity stages surface dirt was removed and the plant was then separated into stem leaves roots and grains the maize plants were put in an oven at 105 c for 1 h and at 75 c to constant weight and the mass was weighed using an electronic balance the population dry mass kg ha 1 was obtained by multiplying the average dry mass of the four maize plants sampled in each plot by the planting density 2 3 3 grain yield when maize entered the ripening stage 20 maize plants were randomly selected in each plot and the maize ear was harvested after completely removing the bracts the kernels were bagged naturally dried and weighed the 100 grain weight was obtained and the individual plant yield and yield per ha were then calculated 2 3 4 crop water productivity cwp the crop water productivity was calculated using the following equation zheng et al 2018b 2 cwp y et where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 and et is the crop evapotranspiration which is calculated as 3 et pe u i d r Î´w where pe is the effective rainfall u is the groundwater recharge i is the amount of irrigation r is the surface runoff d is the deep drainage and Î´w is the change in soil moisture from the beginning to the end of the experiment oweis et al 2011 according to the actual conditions during the experiments the contributions of groundwater recharge and surface runoff were negligible due to the deep groundwater table and leveled land surface besides soil water content in the 1 0 1 2 m soil layer constantly declined or slightly fluctuated over the growing season indicating that no or minimal deep drainage occurred in the experiments 2 3 5 partial factor productivity pfp the partial factor productivity was calculated using the following equation ierna et al 2011 pfp y ft 4 where ft is the total applied n p2o5 and k2o kg ha 1 2 3 6 economic benefit eb the economic benefit was calculated as follows 5 eb gp iw fw o where gp is the gross profit iw is the water fee fw is the fertilizer inputs and o are other inputs 2 3 7 likelihood

three types of the combined likelihood functions i e weighted addition zak et al 1997 with the weighting coefficients of all terms as 1 k bayes multiplication beven and binley 1992 and aggregated function suggested by wang et al 2005 with the weighting coefficients of all terms as 1 k respectively 2 3 8 optimization of drip irrigation and fertilization grain yield cwp and net returns were considered for optimizing the combination of irrigation and fertilization in this study binary quadratic regression equations of aboveground biomass grain yield cwp pfp and net return with irrigation or fertilization amount as independent variables were established using the mathematicals 9 0 software grain yield cwp and net return were further normalized since they could not be maximized simultaneously and thus could not be directly compared with each other due to the differences in dimensions specifically relative yield cwp and net return were obtained by grain yield cwp and net returns for each treatment divided by the corresponding maximum 2 3 9 data analysis data processing and analysis of variance were conducted using excel 2010 and spss12 0 software multiple comparisons were adopted using the ssr method the significant difference was 0 05 Î± 0 05 the figures were plotted by sigmaplot10 0 3 results 3 1 aboveground biomass fig 1 shows the accumulation of aboveground biomass of spring maize under different drip fertigation conditions in 2015 and 2016 the aboveground biomass showed negligible variations before 50 d after sowing from the booting stage 65 75 d after sowing the accumulation of aboveground biomass differed among various treatments and the accumulation rate of aboveground biomass was maximized during the milk ripening period the accumulation rate of aboveground biomass tailed off during the maturation period the aboveground biomass was maximized at f180 treatment in 2016 at i60 and i120 the aboveground biomass was reduced by increasing fertilizer amount above f180 indicating that excessive fertilizer application hinders the accumulation of aboveground biomass in all the fertilization treatments the aboveground biomass accumulation increased with increasing irrigation amount from i60 to i105 in 2015 while it first increased as the irrigation amount increased from i60 to i100 and then decreased when the irrigation amount was above i100in 2016 as for grain yield the maximized biomass yield was achieved at i105 and i100 in 2015 and 2016 respectively in terms of interaction effects of water and fertilizers on aboveground biomass accumulation the maximized biomass yield was achieved at i105f180 and i100f240 in 2015 42 1 mg ha 1 and 2016 38 9 mg ha 1 respectively 3 2 grain yield and its components table 1 summarizes the spring maize yield and its corresponding yield components in 2015 and 2016 the interaction between irrigation and fertilization was significant for spring maize yield and its components p 0 05 except grain free length in 2015 by increasing irrigation and fertilization amounts the weight of 100 grains of spring maize was generally enhanced however over fertilization had a negative effect on the yield as it caused a decrease in the grain number per spike under the same fertilization level grain yield increased with the increasing irrigation amount in 2015 compared with the i105 treatment the i60 i75 and i90 treatments reduced grain yields by 29 2 16 1 and 3 9 respectively in 2016 grain yield first increased and then decreased as the irrigation amount increased compared with i100 treatment i60 i80 and i120 treatments reduced grain yields by 28 2 12 9 and 7 2 respectively the difference can be attributed to the fact that the i120 irrigation amount applied in 2016 exceeded that required by spring maize under the same irrigation amount grain yield increased and then decreased maximized in the f180 treatment as the fertilizer amount increased in both years this study indicated that the yield of spring maize can be enhanced by increasing irrigation and fertilization within a certain range while excessive irrigation and fertilization led to a decline in grain yield in terms of water and fertilizer interactions grain yield was maximized at i105f180 in 2015 18 81 mg ha 1 and at i100f180 in 2016 20 53 mg ha 1 3 3 soil water content cwp and pfp swc values in different soil layers averaged over the growing seasons of spring maize in 2015 and 2016 in different treatments are shown in table 2 the average soil water content of the 0 1 2 m soil layer was first increased and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount in both years compared with the i75 treatment i60 i90 and i105 treatments reduced swc by 2 6 13 8 and 2 0 in 2015 respectively compared with the i80 treatment the i60 i100 and i120 treatments reduced swc by 2 0 5 5 and 1 3 in 2016 respectively average soil water content in the 0 0 8 m soil layer was the lowest at i90 in 2015 and at i100 2016 with average values of 0 181 and 0 188 cm3 cm 3 respectively average soil water content in the deeper soil layer 0 8 1 2 m was higher than that in the 0 0 8 m soil layer but no obvious trend was observed among the four irrigation levers an accumulative irrigation amount of 245 mm 306 mm 368 mm and 430 mm was applied at i60 i75 i90 and i105 in 2015 respectively while the corresponding values were 290 mm 370 mm 450 mm and 530 mm in 2016 fig 2 shows the effects of drip fertigation level on cwp of spring maize in 2015 and 2016 the effects of fertilization on cwp were significant in 2015 p 0 01 while the effects of irrigation and fertilization on cwp were significant in 2016 p 0 01 the effects of water and fertilizer interaction on cwp were significant in both years p 0 05 under the same fertilization amount cwp increased and then decreased as the irrigation amount increased in both years and maximized at i90 in 2015 and i100 in 2016 hence the excessive reduction in irrigation amount had a negative effect on cwp grain yield at i60 was 11 6 lower than that at i90 in 2015 and grain yield at i60 was 15 6 lower than that at i100 in 2016 under the same irrigation amount cwp increased and then decreased as the fertilizer amount increased in both years and maximized at f240 compared to grain yield at f180 the yields at f60 f120 and f240 were reduced by 18 2 6 4 and 4 2 in 2015 respectively while the corresponding values were 16 3 6 4 and 3 9 in 2016 respectively in terms of the interaction effects of water and fertilizers on cwp the maximum cwp 3 32 kg m 3 in 2015 was achieved at i90f180 and the maximum cwp 3 99 kg m 3 in 2016 was achieved at i100f180 as shown in fig 2 irrigation and fertilization as well as their interaction had significant effects on pfp in both years p 0 01 under the same fertilization amount pfp increased as the irrigation amount increased in 2015 but it increased and then decreased in 2016 under the same irrigation amount pfp decreased as the fertilization amount increased and was maximized at f60 in both years 3 4 economic benefits as shown in table 3 the gross profits were 18 492 30 103 cny ha 1 in 2015 and 20 164 32 843 cny ha 1 in 2016 the maximum gross profit was increased by 62 8 compared with the minimum gross profit in 2016 while the corresponding value was 62 9 in 2015 the net returns were 6274 17 482 cny ha 1 in 2015 and 8211 20 174 cny ha 1 in 2016 and the differences in net returns were up to 11 208 cny ha 1 in 2015 and 11 963 cny ha 1 in 2016 indicating that inappropriate irrigation and fertilization management led to significantly reduced net returns of spring maize the maximum loss of net returns caused by reduced irrigation and fertilization amounts was 7649 cny ha 1 in 2015 and 3214 cny ha 1 in 2016 which was considered as the main obstacle for the reduction of water and fertilizers at i60 the net returns at f120 and f180 were increased by 15 0 24 7 compared to that at f60 in both years but the net returns at f240 decreased due to the increased costs and reduced gross profits at other irrigation levels the net return was increased by 21 1 on average due to increasing fertilization amounts therefore the net return increased significantly as fertilization amount increased at low irrigation levels although the benefits may not be maximized table 3 3 5 water fertilizer interaction effect in drip irrigation in this study high yield high efficiency and sustainable production of drip fertigated spring maize under plastic film cover were the ultimate objectives according to table 4 these binary quadratic regression equations reached highly significant levels p 0 01 with the coefficients of determination above 0 81 fig 3 shows the relationships between irrigation and fertilization regimes and spring maize grain yield aboveground biomass cwp pfp and net returns as observed the interaction effects of irrigation and fertilization on spring maize yield aboveground biomass cwp and net return were convex downwards fig 3a b c f while the interaction effect on pfp was concave upwards fig 3d the irrigation and fertilization amounts corresponding to maximum spring maize yield aboveground biomass cwp and net return were consistent while those corresponding to maximum pfp were significantly different 3 6 evaluation of optimized water fertilizer combination to obtain the optimized inputs of water and fertilizers for drip fertigated spring maize under plastic film cover the lower limits of irrigation and fertilization were set as 60 etc and 60 30 30 mg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o respectively while the upper limits were extended to 140 etc and 300 150 150 to include the optimal value respectively the irrigation and fertilization amounts corresponding to the maximum value of each index are summarized in table 5 as observed it is impossible to maximize all the five indexes at any combinations of irrigation and fertilization and a trade off is thus required aboveground biomass had a very good correlation with grain yield and grain yield was more preferred instead of biomass accumulation in addition as we mentioned earlier pfp had the opposing change trends to grain yield water use efficiency and economic benefits as shown in fig 4 the quadratic curves of relative yield relative cwp and relative net return against water and fertilizer inputs were elliptic curves with identical center point which was the maximum value of the objective function a contour map of the 95 maximum of the three indexes of grain yield crop water productivity and net returns was further projected to obtain a comprehensive analysis fig 5 when the irrigation amount ranged 404 2 547 6 mm 93 126 etc and the fertilizer n p2o5 k2o amount varied 124 62 62 to 228 114 114 kg ha 1 the spring maize yield crop water productivity and net returns reached 95 of their maximum values simultaneously the optimal water and fertilizer inputs obtained by the likelihood estimation can be seen in table 5 c1 had the lowest irrigation amount but the fertilization amount was increased by 32 and 40 kg ha 1 compared with c2 and c3 respectively the corresponding net return was reduced by more than 5 compared with c2 and c3 the net returns of c2 and c3 were similar the fertilization amount of c2 was only increased by 8 kg ha 1 compared with that of c3 but the irrigation amount of c2 was 28 mm lower than that of c3 on the whole c2 can ensure high grain yield with relatively low irrigation and fertilization inputs which is thus considered as the optimized water and fertilizer combination in this study in summary the overall benefits of grain yield cwp and net returns of spring maize were maximized with irrigation amount of 474 mm 109 etc and medium high fertilizer amount of 184 92 92 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 the optimized fertilizer amount of 184 92 92 kg ha 1 saved fertilization input by about 25 compared to the normal high fertilization rate of 240 120 120 kg ha 1 4 discussion as demonstrated previously payero et al 2006 pampolino et al 2012 djaman et al 2013 xu et al 2014 kresoviÄ et al 2016 and in this study the maize grain yield was quadratically correlated to irrigation and fertilization amounts this study showed that the highest yields were achieved at i105f180 in 2015 and i100f180 in 2016 the high yields can be attributed to the appropriate irrigation and fertilization amounts wang et al 2011 chilundo et al 2017 the arid areas in northwest china are characterized by abundant light and heat resources which facilitate the accumulation of photosynthetic products and thus increase grain yield nevertheless excessive water and fertilizers may lead to rapid growth of plants resulting in excessive leaf area index that affects the use of light energy by crops and effective distribution of photosynthetic products therefore reasonable irrigation and fertilization can ensure that crops make full use of light energy resources to improve photosynthetic efficiency in our arid area irrigation had a significant effect on spring maize yield the average yield at i60 was decreased by 28 7 compared to that at i100 and i105 for effects of fertilization on grain yield fertilization amount at f60 was reduced by 66 7 compared with that at f180 while the average grain yield was reduced by 16 3 in the two years indicating that the spring maize in this area was more sensitive to the reduction of irrigation amount irrigation reduction had negative effects on crop yields paredes et al 2014 di paolo and rinaldi 2008 and the effects were closely related to water deficits during different growth periods and the deficit duration cakir 2004 on the other hand appropriate fertilization reduction had negligible effects on grain yield jin et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 this study showed that irrigation reduction led to a significant reduction in aboveground biomass as reported elsewhere stone et al 2001 farrÃ© and faci 2006 cakir 2004 reported that short term dehydration at the fast growing stage of maize led to 28 32 reduction in the aboveground biomass on the other hand over irrigation will also lead to a reduction in the aboveground dry mass in 2016 aboveground biomass at i120 was reduced by 5 2 compared with that at i100 some previous studies claimed that the maize biomass increased with the increasing fertilization amount fan et al 2005 however this study found that the aboveground biomass first increased and then decreased as the fertilization amount increased and the reduction was related to the irrigation amount in 2015 the aboveground biomass at f240 was reduced by 15 3 7 1 6 1 and 0 2 compared with that at i60 i75 i90 and i105 respectively indicating that the loss of the aboveground biomass at high fertilization levels was proportional to water deficit which is consistent with previous studies ogola et al 2002 the ultimate objective of agricultural irrigation is to maximize the production per unit water consumption and this shall be achieved by establishing an appropriate irrigation system zhang et al 2008 it has been reported that cwp is negatively correlated to the irrigation amount kuscu and demir 2013 kresoviÄ et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b nevertheless our study showed that cwp first increased and then decreased as irrigation amount increased under the same fertilization amount the highest cwp was achieved at 90 etc in 2015 2 90 kg m 3 and 100 etc in 2016 3 29 kg m 3 this may be due to the fact that increased irrigation amount can facilitate the full use of light and heat resources fan et al 2018a b resulting in increased accumulation of dry mass and yield however excessive water supply may lead to excessive light and heat utilization and result in extended vegetative growth and delayed reproductive growth for instance the booting stage of i120 treatment was postponed by 3 d relative to that of the i100 treatment besides over irrigation may have caused some deep drainage and associated leaching of nutrients in the soil thereby reducing maize yield when the temperature decreased drastically during the late mature period fig s1 the accumulation of aboveground biomass was terminated before grain maturing resulting in reduced cwp payero et al 2008 reported that cwp increased nonlinearly with seasonal etc and grain yield and cwp was more sensitive to irrigation in drought years the cwp obtained in this study was higher than the global average 1 80 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and significantly higher than the average cwp 0 46 kg m 3 measured in northwest china deng et al 2006 this can be attributed to the film covered drip irrigation technology employed in this study which improves the cwp of spring maize by reducing soil evaporation and deep leakage and enables uniform distribution of water and nutrients in the tillage layer also the cwp was affected by the fertilizer application under the same irrigation amount cwp was maximized at a fertilization rate of 180 90 90 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 the effects of irrigation and fertilization amounts on cwp have been well investigated mahdi et al 2003 reported that cwp was maximized with irrigation amount of 80 etc and 140 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen application rate lamm et al 2004 reported that the cwp of maize at 75 etc irrigation amount was maximized with 180 kg n ha 1 nitrogen application rate this study demonstrated that pfp first increased and then decreased as the irrigation amount increased in 2016 which is consistent with previous studies caviglia et al 2014 jia et al 2014 however pfp decreased as the fertilization increased in this study which was not consistent with previous studies this may be attributed to the difference in sensitivity of maize growth to the irrigation amount across different climatic areas in agriculture economic benefits are the ultimate goal quadratic correlations of economic benefits against irrigation and fertilization amount except for irrigation in 2015 were shown under the same fertilization amount irrigation reduction could cause severe economic losses indeed the average economic benefit corresponding to 105 etc was 94 higher than that corresponding to 60 etc in 2015 and the average economic benefit corresponding to 100 etc was 82 higher than that corresponding to 60 etc in 2016 under the same irrigation amount the economic benefits first increased and then decreased as the fertilization amount increased indicating that economic benefits are not always proportional to fertilization amount in all cases which is consistent with previous studies he et al 2014 in jingtai area of gansu province li 2014 found that the economic benefit of spring maize increased with the increase of irrigation amount under the fertilization level of 450 225 150 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 and the maximum economic benefit of 20 790 cny ha 1 was obtained at the irrigation level of 468 mm in the sandy area of egypt the maximum economic benefit was only 4890 cny ha 1 with the fertilization level of 180 72 36 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 and the irrigation amount of 680 mm xiang et al 2015 it can be seen that the economic benefits of spring maize are affected by both the amounts of irrigation fertilizer applied as well as the soil texture and the price of maize in different years which is a problem worthy of further discussion this study found that the three dimensional relationships of grain yield aboveground biomass cwp and net returns against water and fertilizer inputs exhibited a downward convex shape fig 3 these four indexes generally first increased and then decreased as the irrigation and fertilization amounts increased which further confirmed the interaction effect of water and fertilizer on maize production cwp and net returns as shown in tables 1 and 2 in our study the maximum net return of 17 935 cny ha 1 was achieved with irrigation amount of 474 mm 109 etc and fertilization amount of 184 92 92 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 in other words an increase of 1391 cny ha 1 in economic benefit was achieved with a reduction of 66 mm in irrigation amount this can be attributed to the effective fertilization system involved in this study which facilitates the accumulation of dry mass in maize kernels and reduces irrigation and fertilization amounts therefore effective irrigation and fertilization management can reduce water and fertilizer consumption and increase economic benefits in arid areas 5 conclusions appropriate reduction of fertilization did not significantly reduce the grain yield of spring maize but low irrigation and fertilization amounts significantly reduced economic benefits the highest yields were obtained at i105f180 18 81 mg ha 1 and at i100f180 20 53 mg ha 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the average yield was decreased by 28 7 and the net return was decreased by 45 6 when the irrigation amount was decreased from 100 to 105 etc to 60 etc the average yield was reduced by 16 3 and the net return was reduced by 21 3 when the fertilization amount was decreased from 180 90 90 to 60 30 30 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 maize yield cwp and net returns reached 95 of their maximum values simultaneously when the irrigation amount varied 93 126 etc and fertilizer n p2o5 k2o amount ranged 124 62 62 228 114 114 kg ha 1 in the two years this study can provide a guideline for appropriate water and

10752,spring maize is one of the major cereal crops in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china but limited water resources and low water fertilizer use efficiency largely restrict the sustainable development of local agriculture a two year ï¬eld experiment was conducted to explore the effects of water fertilizer interaction on aboveground biomass grain yield crop water productivity cwp partial factor productivity pfp and economic benefits of spring maize particularly the optimized combination of drip irrigation and fertilization regimes for high grain yield cwp and economic benefits were attained by multiple regression analysis and likelihood estimation the irrigation levels included i60 60 etc etc is the crop evapotranspiration i75 i90 and i105 in 2015 and i60 i80 i100 and i120 in 2016 the n p2o5 k2o fertilization levels kg ha 1 consisted of f60 60 30 30 f120 120 60 60 f180 180 90 90 and f240 240 120 120 corresponding to low medium medium high and normal high fertilization rates respectively aboveground biomass grain yield cwp pfp and net returns generally increased as irrigation and fertilization amount increased except for that cwp and pfp constantly decreased with increasing irrigation and fertilizer amounts respectively there were significant interaction effects on these indexes in both years the highest yields were 18 81 mg ha 1 at i105f180 and 20 53 mg ha 1 at i100f180 the highest cwp were 3 32 kg m 3 at i90f180 and 3 99 kg m 3 at i100f180 and the highest net returns were 17 482 cny ha 1 at i105f180 and 20 174 cny ha 1 at i100f180 in 2015 and 2016 respectively maize yield cwp and net returns reached 95 of their maximum values simultaneously when irrigation amount ranged 93 126 etc and fertilizer n p2o5 k2o amount ranged 124 62 62 228 114 114 kg ha 1 the overall benefits of maize yield cwp and net returns were finally maximized with irrigation amount of 109 etc 474 mm and medium high fertilizer n p2o5 k2o

keywords drip fertigation spring maize grain yield crop water productivity partial factor productivity economic benefits 1 introduction the maize planting area in china has exceeded 35 45 mha no 1 globally while the annual production is 2 18 pg and accounts for 22 0 of the world s total production but this is still 13 4 less than that in the united states fao 2016 therefore a huge potential in yield increase is possible for maize production in china liu and zhang 2007 xiong et al 2010 zheng et al 2018a in 2020 the food production in china should exceed 5 50 pg of which maize accounts for 53 1 hence crop yields per unit of water and land must be further improved however sustainable food production is limited by various factors such as climate irrigation and fertilization maize is one of the major cereal crops planted in the arid and semi arid areas of northwest china guo et al 2009 piao et al 2010 tao and zhang 2011 in 2017 the maize planting area in these regions reached 3 58 mha accounting for 12 5 of the national maize planting area china national bureau of statistics previous studies have showed that crop yields can be effectively improved by optimizing water and fertilization management elhendawy and schmidhalter 2010 mueller et al 2012 wang et al 2018 yan et al 2019 in practice however farmers tend to choose over irrigation and over fertilization to maximize grain yields based on their experiences which actually results in decreased use efficiency of water and fertilizer and reduced economic efficiency owing to the recent rapid agricultural modernization in china drip fertigation has been widely applied in agricultural production wang et al 2014 fan et al 2017 wang et al 2019 this technology can increase crop yields and significantly improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizers marra et al 2003 gheysari et al 2015 fan et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 in the arid areas of northwest china water is the limiting factor for agricultural production and cwp needs to be continuously improved the effects of irrigation amount on maize yield popova and pereira 2011 ma et al 2012 water productivity payero et al 2009 kafetzis et al 2010 and economic returns rodrigues and pereira 2009 abdel wahed and ali 2012 domÃ­nguez et al 2012 sihlongonyane et al 2014 have been well assessed for instance rodrigues et al 2013 evaluated the effects of irrigation amount on maize production in terms of economic efficiency and cwp they found that adequate irrigation led to high maize yields and economic benefits but it reduced cwp brennan 2008 claimed that the amount of irrigation water required could be reduced by increasing the capital expenditure on equipment thus balancing the economic benefits therefore an optimized irrigation regime that balances crop water productivity fertilization efficiency and maize production is highly required to optimize the economic benefits with limited water resources kampas et al 2012 montero et al 2012 khan et al 2009 and fan et al 2005 claimed that crop productivity can be significantly enhanced by increasing fertilization amount despite the key role of fertilizers in food security over application of chemical fertilizers may lead to a decline in crop production balasubramanian et al 1998 zheng et al 2017 accelerated acidification of farmland guo et al 2010 increased greenhouse gas emissions

nitrogen leaching through optimization of farm management zhang et al 2017a investigated the single factor effects marginal effects and interaction effects of nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer potash fertilizer and irrigation amount on the photosynthetic rate of maize based on a quadruple quadratic regression model it was found that the most suitable combination of irrigation water and fertilizer amounts was as follows irrigation amount of 700 m3 ha 1 and the fertilizer amounts of 270 0 kg ha 1 n 60 26 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 60 02 kg ha 1 k2o as the relatively high maize production level in china is resulted from high consumption high costs and high environmental pollution the development of sustainable agriculture in china has been severely limited the single objective optimization of water and fertilizer use efficiency grain yield and economic efficiency is usually not enough for sustainable agricultural development an effective irrigation and fertilization scheduling is urgently needed to guarantee sufficient food production good environmental protection and increased farmer income spring maize is a main crop in the arid and semi arid region of northwest china where the maize yield accounts for about 10 of the national production although previous studies have optimized water supply and fertilizer input for maximized maize production cwp pfp or net returns few studies have focused on the optimal management of water and fertilizer that can comprehensively improve grain yield cwp pfp and economic benefits of spring maize in this study quantitative correlations between aboveground biomass grain yield cwp pfp and net returns against water and fertilizer inputs were established to obtain an optimized water and fertilizer management strategy for spring maize yield in northwest china its economic efficiency water and fertilizer use efficiency based on multiple regression analysis and likelihood estimation 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental plots field experiments were conducted during the growing seasons of spring maize april to september in 2015 and 2016 at the agricultural and ecological water saving experimental station of china agricultural university 37 50 n 102 51 e on the edge of the tengger desert with an altitude of 1584 m the local arid climate is continental with an annual average temperature of 8 c the total precipitation at the experimental site during the spring maize growth season was 141 mm in 2015 and the corresponding value was 115 mm in 2016 however the total amounts of effective rainfall events 5 mm were 120 mm in 2015 and 86 mm in 2016 the soil in the 0 1 2 m layer was characterized as clay soil with an average soil bulk density of 1 52 g cm 3 water holding capacity of 32 9 volumetric water content and saturated water content of 42 6 the soil contained 50 3 mg kg 1 alkaline hydrolysable nitrogen 3 82 mg kg 1 effective phosphorus and 8 9 g kg 1 organic matter with a ph of 8 22 the groundwater used for irrigation was extracted from a depth of 40 m with a mineralization degree of 0 71 g l 1 2 2 experimental design the spring maize variety qiangsheng 51 shanxi qiangsheng seeds co ltd was tested in the present study the applied fertilizers were urea phosphate and potassium sulphate according to local practice transparent polyethylene film was used as cover film with a width of 1 2 m and a thickness of 8 Î¼m the drip fertilization equipment consisted of water source water pump proportional fertilizer pump and pipeline system for water transport and distribution the drip irrigation belt was patch type with a dripper spacing of 0 2 m a dripper flow rate of 2 3 l h 1 and a working pressure of 0 2 mpa four irrigation levels including 60 75 90 and 105 of etc i60 i75 i90 and i105 respectively were used in 2015 however it was found that maize yield continued to increase with increasing irrigation level until i105 in 2015 therefore the four irrigation levels were further increased to i60 i80 i100 and i120 in 2016 to verify if near 100 etc was best for maize production etc was the actual crop evapotranspiration mm m 2 d 1 1 e t c e t 0 k c where kc is the maize crop coefficient which was selected as 0 7 at the seeding stage 1 2 at the jointing stage to grain filling stage and 0 6 at the milky to maturity stage allen et al 1998 and et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm m 2 d 1 calculated according to the fao penman monteith equation fan et al 2018 the variations of meteorological variables during the two seasons are shown in fig s1 the sixteen treatments were replicated three times in a randomized complete factorial block design the experimental plots had a length of 6 m and a width of 5 m including 11 maize rows in the length direction of the plot with a plant spacing of 0 2 m wide 0 8 m and narrow 0 4 m rows were alternated one drip irrigation belt located in the middle of the narrow rows with a distance of 0 2 m from each row was used to irrigate the 50 maize plants in two maize rows each dripper corresponded to two maize plants and the maize plant density was 76 500 91 8 emergence rate plants per ha more planting details are shown in fig s2 the maize was irrigated at 10 day intervals but the date of irrigation was postponed to the next day in case of rainfall etc used to calculate irrigation amount during each event was the sum of daily etc during the 10 days before irrigation the actual irrigation amount excluded the water loss in irrigation pipelines and the coefficient of irrigation water use was taken as 0 95 wu et al 2014 in 2015 the initial soil water content of the experimental plots was high so no irrigation water was applied for seedling emergence irrigation was started when maize plants had three leaves and ended in both years 15 20 days before harvest four fertilization levels of n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 were applied as low medium medium high and normal high fertilization rates i e f60 60 30 30 f120 120 60 60 f180 180 90 90 and f240 240 120 120 therefore a total of 16 treatments were tested in triplicate maize plants were fertilized on four occasions along with drip irrigation based on their growth condition as shown in fig s3 20 of fertilizers at the seeding stage may 13rd 2015 and may 17th 2016 30 at the six leaf collar stage june 12th 2015 and june 6th 2016 30 at the tasseling stage july 5th 2015 and july 7th 2016 and 20 at the grain filling stage july 24th 2015 and july 37th 2016 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 soil water content soil samples were collected before irrigation and two days after irrigation using a soil auger starting from the middle point of two drippers on one drip irrigation belt soil samples were collected at 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 6 m distances to the drip irrigation belt the soil layers were 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 0 8 1 0 and 1 0 1 2 m three replicates were conducted at each sampling location soil samples were dried at 105 c until their weights were constant and soil water content was calculated by the weight difference of fresh and dried soils the average weight of three replicates was used 2 3 2 aboveground biomass four maize plants were randomly selected from each plot and cut off from the base of the stem at the seeding six collars twelve collars tasseling filling milky and maturity stages surface dirt was removed and the plant was then separated into stem leaves roots and grains the maize plants were put in an oven at 105 c for 1 h and at 75 c to constant weight and the mass was weighed using an electronic balance the population dry mass kg ha 1 was obtained by multiplying the average dry mass of the four maize plants sampled in each plot by the planting density 2 3 3 grain yield when maize entered the ripening stage 20 maize plants were randomly selected in each plot and the maize ear was harvested after completely removing the bracts the kernels were bagged naturally dried and weighed the 100 grain weight was obtained and the individual plant yield and yield per ha were then calculated 2 3 4 crop water productivity cwp the crop water productivity was calculated using the following equation zheng et al 2018b 2 cwp y et where y is the grain yield kg ha 1 and et is the crop evapotranspiration which is calculated as 3 et pe u i d r Î´w where pe is the effective rainfall u is the groundwater recharge i is the amount of irrigation r is the surface runoff d is the deep drainage and Î´w is the change in soil moisture from the beginning to the end of the experiment oweis et al 2011 according to the actual conditions during the experiments the contributions of groundwater recharge and surface runoff were negligible due to the deep groundwater table and leveled land surface besides soil water content in the 1 0 1 2 m soil layer constantly declined or slightly fluctuated over the growing season indicating that no or minimal deep drainage occurred in the experiments 2 3 5 partial factor productivity pfp the partial factor productivity was calculated using the following equation ierna et al 2011 pfp y ft 4 where ft is the total applied n p2o5 and k2o kg ha 1 2 3 6 economic benefit eb the economic benefit was calculated as follows 5 eb gp iw fw o where gp is the gross profit iw is the water fee fw is the fertilizer inputs and o are other inputs 2 3 7 likelihood

three types of the combined likelihood functions i e weighted addition zak et al 1997 with the weighting coefficients of all terms as 1 k bayes multiplication beven and binley 1992 and aggregated function suggested by wang et al 2005 with the weighting coefficients of all terms as 1 k respectively 2 3 8 optimization of drip irrigation and fertilization grain yield cwp and net returns were considered for optimizing the combination of irrigation and fertilization in this study binary quadratic regression equations of aboveground biomass grain yield cwp pfp and net return with irrigation or fertilization amount as independent variables were established using the mathematicals 9 0 software grain yield cwp and net return were further normalized since they could not be maximized simultaneously and thus could not be directly compared with each other due to the differences in dimensions specifically relative yield cwp and net return were obtained by grain yield cwp and net returns for each treatment divided by the corresponding maximum 2 3 9 data analysis data processing and analysis of variance were conducted using excel 2010 and spss12 0 software multiple comparisons were adopted using the ssr method the significant difference was 0 05 Î± 0 05 the figures were plotted by sigmaplot10 0 3 results 3 1 aboveground biomass fig 1 shows the accumulation of aboveground biomass of spring maize under different drip fertigation conditions in 2015 and 2016 the aboveground biomass showed negligible variations before 50 d after sowing from the booting stage 65 75 d after sowing the accumulation of aboveground biomass differed among various treatments and the accumulation rate of aboveground biomass was maximized during the milk ripening period the accumulation rate of aboveground biomass tailed off during the maturation period the aboveground biomass was maximized at f180 treatment in 2016 at i60 and i120 the aboveground biomass was reduced by increasing fertilizer amount above f180 indicating that excessive fertilizer application hinders the accumulation of aboveground biomass in all the fertilization treatments the aboveground biomass accumulation increased with increasing irrigation amount from i60 to i105 in 2015 while it first increased as the irrigation amount increased from i60 to i100 and then decreased when the irrigation amount was above i100in 2016 as for grain yield the maximized biomass yield was achieved at i105 and i100 in 2015 and 2016 respectively in terms of interaction effects of water and fertilizers on aboveground biomass accumulation the maximized biomass yield was achieved at i105f180 and i100f240 in 2015 42 1 mg ha 1 and 2016 38 9 mg ha 1 respectively 3 2 grain yield and its components table 1 summarizes the spring maize yield and its corresponding yield components in 2015 and 2016 the interaction between irrigation and fertilization was significant for spring maize yield and its components p 0 05 except grain free length in 2015 by increasing irrigation and fertilization amounts the weight of 100 grains of spring maize was generally enhanced however over fertilization had a negative effect on the yield as it caused a decrease in the grain number per spike under the same fertilization level grain yield increased with the increasing irrigation amount in 2015 compared with the i105 treatment the i60 i75 and i90 treatments reduced grain yields by 29 2 16 1 and 3 9 respectively in 2016 grain yield first increased and then decreased as the irrigation amount increased compared with i100 treatment i60 i80 and i120 treatments reduced grain yields by 28 2 12 9 and 7 2 respectively the difference can be attributed to the fact that the i120 irrigation amount applied in 2016 exceeded that required by spring maize under the same irrigation amount grain yield increased and then decreased maximized in the f180 treatment as the fertilizer amount increased in both years this study indicated that the yield of spring maize can be enhanced by increasing irrigation and fertilization within a certain range while excessive irrigation and fertilization led to a decline in grain yield in terms of water and fertilizer interactions grain yield was maximized at i105f180 in 2015 18 81 mg ha 1 and at i100f180 in 2016 20 53 mg ha 1 3 3 soil water content cwp and pfp swc values in different soil layers averaged over the growing seasons of spring maize in 2015 and 2016 in different treatments are shown in table 2 the average soil water content of the 0 1 2 m soil layer was first increased and then decreased with the increase of irrigation amount in both years compared with the i75 treatment i60 i90 and i105 treatments reduced swc by 2 6 13 8 and 2 0 in 2015 respectively compared with the i80 treatment the i60 i100 and i120 treatments reduced swc by 2 0 5 5 and 1 3 in 2016 respectively average soil water content in the 0 0 8 m soil layer was the lowest at i90 in 2015 and at i100 2016 with average values of 0 181 and 0 188 cm3 cm 3 respectively average soil water content in the deeper soil layer 0 8 1 2 m was higher than that in the 0 0 8 m soil layer but no obvious trend was observed among the four irrigation levers an accumulative irrigation amount of 245 mm 306 mm 368 mm and 430 mm was applied at i60 i75 i90 and i105 in 2015 respectively while the corresponding values were 290 mm 370 mm 450 mm and 530 mm in 2016 fig 2 shows the effects of drip fertigation level on cwp of spring maize in 2015 and 2016 the effects of fertilization on cwp were significant in 2015 p 0 01 while the effects of irrigation and fertilization on cwp were significant in 2016 p 0 01 the effects of water and fertilizer interaction on cwp were significant in both years p 0 05 under the same fertilization amount cwp increased and then decreased as the irrigation amount increased in both years and maximized at i90 in 2015 and i100 in 2016 hence the excessive reduction in irrigation amount had a negative effect on cwp grain yield at i60 was 11 6 lower than that at i90 in 2015 and grain yield at i60 was 15 6 lower than that at i100 in 2016 under the same irrigation amount cwp increased and then decreased as the fertilizer amount increased in both years and maximized at f240 compared to grain yield at f180 the yields at f60 f120 and f240 were reduced by 18 2 6 4 and 4 2 in 2015 respectively while the corresponding values were 16 3 6 4 and 3 9 in 2016 respectively in terms of the interaction effects of water and fertilizers on cwp the maximum cwp 3 32 kg m 3 in 2015 was achieved at i90f180 and the maximum cwp 3 99 kg m 3 in 2016 was achieved at i100f180 as shown in fig 2 irrigation and fertilization as well as their interaction had significant effects on pfp in both years p 0 01 under the same fertilization amount pfp increased as the irrigation amount increased in 2015 but it increased and then decreased in 2016 under the same irrigation amount pfp decreased as the fertilization amount increased and was maximized at f60 in both years 3 4 economic benefits as shown in table 3 the gross profits were 18 492 30 103 cny ha 1 in 2015 and 20 164 32 843 cny ha 1 in 2016 the maximum gross profit was increased by 62 8 compared with the minimum gross profit in 2016 while the corresponding value was 62 9 in 2015 the net returns were 6274 17 482 cny ha 1 in 2015 and 8211 20 174 cny ha 1 in 2016 and the differences in net returns were up to 11 208 cny ha 1 in 2015 and 11 963 cny ha 1 in 2016 indicating that inappropriate irrigation and fertilization management led to significantly reduced net returns of spring maize the maximum loss of net returns caused by reduced irrigation and fertilization amounts was 7649 cny ha 1 in 2015 and 3214 cny ha 1 in 2016 which was considered as the main obstacle for the reduction of water and fertilizers at i60 the net returns at f120 and f180 were increased by 15 0 24 7 compared to that at f60 in both years but the net returns at f240 decreased due to the increased costs and reduced gross profits at other irrigation levels the net return was increased by 21 1 on average due to increasing fertilization amounts therefore the net return increased significantly as fertilization amount increased at low irrigation levels although the benefits may not be maximized table 3 3 5 water fertilizer interaction effect in drip irrigation in this study high yield high efficiency and sustainable production of drip fertigated spring maize under plastic film cover were the ultimate objectives according to table 4 these binary quadratic regression equations reached highly significant levels p 0 01 with the coefficients of determination above 0 81 fig 3 shows the relationships between irrigation and fertilization regimes and spring maize grain yield aboveground biomass cwp pfp and net returns as observed the interaction effects of irrigation and fertilization on spring maize yield aboveground biomass cwp and net return were convex downwards fig 3a b c f while the interaction effect on pfp was concave upwards fig 3d the irrigation and fertilization amounts corresponding to maximum spring maize yield aboveground biomass cwp and net return were consistent while those corresponding to maximum pfp were significantly different 3 6 evaluation of optimized water fertilizer combination to obtain the optimized inputs of water and fertilizers for drip fertigated spring maize under plastic film cover the lower limits of irrigation and fertilization were set as 60 etc and 60 30 30 mg ha 1 n p2o5 k2o respectively while the upper limits were extended to 140 etc and 300 150 150 to include the optimal value respectively the irrigation and fertilization amounts corresponding to the maximum value of each index are summarized in table 5 as observed it is impossible to maximize all the five indexes at any combinations of irrigation and fertilization and a trade off is thus required aboveground biomass had a very good correlation with grain yield and grain yield was more preferred instead of biomass accumulation in addition as we mentioned earlier pfp had the opposing change trends to grain yield water use efficiency and economic benefits as shown in fig 4 the quadratic curves of relative yield relative cwp and relative net return against water and fertilizer inputs were elliptic curves with identical center point which was the maximum value of the objective function a contour map of the 95 maximum of the three indexes of grain yield crop water productivity and net returns was further projected to obtain a comprehensive analysis fig 5 when the irrigation amount ranged 404 2 547 6 mm 93 126 etc and the fertilizer n p2o5 k2o amount varied 124 62 62 to 228 114 114 kg ha 1 the spring maize yield crop water productivity and net returns reached 95 of their maximum values simultaneously the optimal water and fertilizer inputs obtained by the likelihood estimation can be seen in table 5 c1 had the lowest irrigation amount but the fertilization amount was increased by 32 and 40 kg ha 1 compared with c2 and c3 respectively the corresponding net return was reduced by more than 5 compared with c2 and c3 the net returns of c2 and c3 were similar the fertilization amount of c2 was only increased by 8 kg ha 1 compared with that of c3 but the irrigation amount of c2 was 28 mm lower than that of c3 on the whole c2 can ensure high grain yield with relatively low irrigation and fertilization inputs which is thus considered as the optimized water and fertilizer combination in this study in summary the overall benefits of grain yield cwp and net returns of spring maize were maximized with irrigation amount of 474 mm 109 etc and medium high fertilizer amount of 184 92 92 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 the optimized fertilizer amount of 184 92 92 kg ha 1 saved fertilization input by about 25 compared to the normal high fertilization rate of 240 120 120 kg ha 1 4 discussion as demonstrated previously payero et al 2006 pampolino et al 2012 djaman et al 2013 xu et al 2014 kresoviÄ et al 2016 and in this study the maize grain yield was quadratically correlated to irrigation and fertilization amounts this study showed that the highest yields were achieved at i105f180 in 2015 and i100f180 in 2016 the high yields can be attributed to the appropriate irrigation and fertilization amounts wang et al 2011 chilundo et al 2017 the arid areas in northwest china are characterized by abundant light and heat resources which facilitate the accumulation of photosynthetic products and thus increase grain yield nevertheless excessive water and fertilizers may lead to rapid growth of plants resulting in excessive leaf area index that affects the use of light energy by crops and effective distribution of photosynthetic products therefore reasonable irrigation and fertilization can ensure that crops make full use of light energy resources to improve photosynthetic efficiency in our arid area irrigation had a significant effect on spring maize yield the average yield at i60 was decreased by 28 7 compared to that at i100 and i105 for effects of fertilization on grain yield fertilization amount at f60 was reduced by 66 7 compared with that at f180 while the average grain yield was reduced by 16 3 in the two years indicating that the spring maize in this area was more sensitive to the reduction of irrigation amount irrigation reduction had negative effects on crop yields paredes et al 2014 di paolo and rinaldi 2008 and the effects were closely related to water deficits during different growth periods and the deficit duration cakir 2004 on the other hand appropriate fertilization reduction had negligible effects on grain yield jin et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 this study showed that irrigation reduction led to a significant reduction in aboveground biomass as reported elsewhere stone et al 2001 farrÃ© and faci 2006 cakir 2004 reported that short term dehydration at the fast growing stage of maize led to 28 32 reduction in the aboveground biomass on the other hand over irrigation will also lead to a reduction in the aboveground dry mass in 2016 aboveground biomass at i120 was reduced by 5 2 compared with that at i100 some previous studies claimed that the maize biomass increased with the increasing fertilization amount fan et al 2005 however this study found that the aboveground biomass first increased and then decreased as the fertilization amount increased and the reduction was related to the irrigation amount in 2015 the aboveground biomass at f240 was reduced by 15 3 7 1 6 1 and 0 2 compared with that at i60 i75 i90 and i105 respectively indicating that the loss of the aboveground biomass at high fertilization levels was proportional to water deficit which is consistent with previous studies ogola et al 2002 the ultimate objective of agricultural irrigation is to maximize the production per unit water consumption and this shall be achieved by establishing an appropriate irrigation system zhang et al 2008 it has been reported that cwp is negatively correlated to the irrigation amount kuscu and demir 2013 kresoviÄ et al 2016 zhang et al 2017b nevertheless our study showed that cwp first increased and then decreased as irrigation amount increased under the same fertilization amount the highest cwp was achieved at 90 etc in 2015 2 90 kg m 3 and 100 etc in 2016 3 29 kg m 3 this may be due to the fact that increased irrigation amount can facilitate the full use of light and heat resources fan et al 2018a b resulting in increased accumulation of dry mass and yield however excessive water supply may lead to excessive light and heat utilization and result in extended vegetative growth and delayed reproductive growth for instance the booting stage of i120 treatment was postponed by 3 d relative to that of the i100 treatment besides over irrigation may have caused some deep drainage and associated leaching of nutrients in the soil thereby reducing maize yield when the temperature decreased drastically during the late mature period fig s1 the accumulation of aboveground biomass was terminated before grain maturing resulting in reduced cwp payero et al 2008 reported that cwp increased nonlinearly with seasonal etc and grain yield and cwp was more sensitive to irrigation in drought years the cwp obtained in this study was higher than the global average 1 80 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and significantly higher than the average cwp 0 46 kg m 3 measured in northwest china deng et al 2006 this can be attributed to the film covered drip irrigation technology employed in this study which improves the cwp of spring maize by reducing soil evaporation and deep leakage and enables uniform distribution of water and nutrients in the tillage layer also the cwp was affected by the fertilizer application under the same irrigation amount cwp was maximized at a fertilization rate of 180 90 90 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 the effects of irrigation and fertilization amounts on cwp have been well investigated mahdi et al 2003 reported that cwp was maximized with irrigation amount of 80 etc and 140 250 kg ha 1 nitrogen application rate lamm et al 2004 reported that the cwp of maize at 75 etc irrigation amount was maximized with 180 kg n ha 1 nitrogen application rate this study demonstrated that pfp first increased and then decreased as the irrigation amount increased in 2016 which is consistent with previous studies caviglia et al 2014 jia et al 2014 however pfp decreased as the fertilization increased in this study which was not consistent with previous studies this may be attributed to the difference in sensitivity of maize growth to the irrigation amount across different climatic areas in agriculture economic benefits are the ultimate goal quadratic correlations of economic benefits against irrigation and fertilization amount except for irrigation in 2015 were shown under the same fertilization amount irrigation reduction could cause severe economic losses indeed the average economic benefit corresponding to 105 etc was 94 higher than that corresponding to 60 etc in 2015 and the average economic benefit corresponding to 100 etc was 82 higher than that corresponding to 60 etc in 2016 under the same irrigation amount the economic benefits first increased and then decreased as the fertilization amount increased indicating that economic benefits are not always proportional to fertilization amount in all cases which is consistent with previous studies he et al 2014 in jingtai area of gansu province li 2014 found that the economic benefit of spring maize increased with the increase of irrigation amount under the fertilization level of 450 225 150 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 and the maximum economic benefit of 20 790 cny ha 1 was obtained at the irrigation level of 468 mm in the sandy area of egypt the maximum economic benefit was only 4890 cny ha 1 with the fertilization level of 180 72 36 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 and the irrigation amount of 680 mm xiang et al 2015 it can be seen that the economic benefits of spring maize are affected by both the amounts of irrigation fertilizer applied as well as the soil texture and the price of maize in different years which is a problem worthy of further discussion this study found that the three dimensional relationships of grain yield aboveground biomass cwp and net returns against water and fertilizer inputs exhibited a downward convex shape fig 3 these four indexes generally first increased and then decreased as the irrigation and fertilization amounts increased which further confirmed the interaction effect of water and fertilizer on maize production cwp and net returns as shown in tables 1 and 2 in our study the maximum net return of 17 935 cny ha 1 was achieved with irrigation amount of 474 mm 109 etc and fertilization amount of 184 92 92 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 in other words an increase of 1391 cny ha 1 in economic benefit was achieved with a reduction of 66 mm in irrigation amount this can be attributed to the effective fertilization system involved in this study which facilitates the accumulation of dry mass in maize kernels and reduces irrigation and fertilization amounts therefore effective irrigation and fertilization management can reduce water and fertilizer consumption and increase economic benefits in arid areas 5 conclusions appropriate reduction of fertilization did not significantly reduce the grain yield of spring maize but low irrigation and fertilization amounts significantly reduced economic benefits the highest yields were obtained at i105f180 18 81 mg ha 1 and at i100f180 20 53 mg ha 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively the average yield was decreased by 28 7 and the net return was decreased by 45 6 when the irrigation amount was decreased from 100 to 105 etc to 60 etc the average yield was reduced by 16 3 and the net return was reduced by 21 3 when the fertilization amount was decreased from 180 90 90 to 60 30 30 n p2o5 k2o kg ha 1 maize yield cwp and net returns reached 95 of their maximum values simultaneously when the irrigation amount varied 93 126 etc and fertilizer n p2o5 k2o amount ranged 124 62 62 228 114 114 kg ha 1 in the two years this study can provide a guideline for appropriate water and

10753,canopy water interception is an important factor in water use efficiency analysis and sprinkler based fertigation technique development in the present study alfalfa canopy water interception and its influence factors were assessed under low wind conditions the canopy interception capacity for three growth stages of alfalfa s1 early vegetative stage s2 late vegetative stage s3 bud stage were measured under two types of low pressure spray sprinklers the dynamics of canopy interception and interception ratio with irrigation depth were also observed the total irrigation depth for all measurements was around 8 mm a weight based canopy interception measurement device was installed outdoors and integrated with a 20 psi sprinkler at 1 m above the canopy the alfalfa canopy interception first increased rapidly with irrigation depth but then stabilized and reached canopy interception capacity i m the minimum irrigation depths to achieve the i m values were 2 mm 3 mm and 4 mm at the s1 s2 and s3 stages respectively i m increased significantly across growth stages and ranged from 0 46 mm to 1 49 mm interception ratio decreased gradually as irrigation depth increased with an approximately 8 mm total irrigation depth interception ratio ranged from 5 27 to 17 59 over all growth stages water application rate had no effect on i m and i m decreased with droplet diameter generally i m was higher and reached more quickly with the r3000 sprinkler compared to the d3000 sprinkler fresh weight plant height and lai of alfalfa had significant positive correlations with canopy interception capacity and a quadratic regression model was developed with using plant height as a factor this study provides valuable and basic information for irrigation schedules and fertigation in alfalfa cultivation keywords canopy interception alfalfa growth stage irrigation depth low pressure sprinkler 1 introduction alfalfa a major forage crop has been increasingly planted in the arid and semi arid regions of northern china li and su 2017 in these areas water resources and soil nutrient content are too low to meet the high demands of alfalfa lamm et al 2012 to efficiently supply water and nutrients center pivot irrigation systems have been widely applied to alfalfa agriculture in these areas owing to their advantages in irrigation efficiency fertigation coverage area application uniformity and labor costs gascho and hook 1991 li et al 2017 o shaughnessy et al 2016 under sprinkler irrigation systems canopy interception of water mostly evaporates into the atmosphere manifests as interception losses which plays an important role in water use efficiency and parameter determination for irrigation scheduling dunkerley 2000 seginer 1967 uddin et al 2016 however other research has indicated that canopy interception will lead to the reduction of crop transpiration rate compared with non wetted canopies burgy and pomeroy 1958 tolk et al 1995 water evaporation from canopy interception can also reduce the vapor pressure deficit and air temperature thereby modifying field microclimates liu and kang 2006 additionally canopy interception plays an important role in developing foliar fertilization techniques because the volume of water stored by crop leaves can influence total fertilization amounts and fertilizer solution concentrations maximizing fertilizer solution interception is a primary requisite to ensure the effectiveness of the foliar fertilization application and the maximum canopy interception can be used to advice about the adequate foliar fertilization spray amount besides the higher salt solution concentration can sometimes result in leaf damage fageria et al 2009 and the canopy interception combined with fertilizer amount can be applied to determine the fertilizer solution concentrations therefore understanding canopy interception can inform both irrigation and fertigation practices lamm and manges 2000 canopy interception is the amount of water temporarily remaining on plants after irrigation or rainfall lamm and manges 2000 generally water intercepted by the canopy will subsequently evaporate into the atmosphere which is considered as the gross interception loss tolk et al 1995 uddin et al 2016 while the suppression of crop transpiration from the wetted canopy as compared to a non wetted canopy can be subtracted from the gross interception loss to calculate the net interception loss tolk et al 1995 during a long period of rainfall or irrigation canopy interception gradually tends to stabilize burgy and pomeroy 1958 jiao et al 2016 the maximum static value of canopy interception after cessation of sprinkler irrigation or rainfall is referred to as canopy interception capacity uddin et al 2016 most research about canopy interception has mainly focused on forest ecosystems and shrubs in order to analyze the hydrologic cycle carlyle moses 2004 gavazzi et al 2016 and zhang et al 2015 studies on canopy interception of field crops have seldom been published and the existing studies have mainly focused on corn and wheat most results have shown that the average amount of corn canopy interception ranged from 1 8 mm to 2 7 mm during the whole growth stages under sprinkler irrigation system with an average gross interception loss of approximately 12 23 lamm and manges 2000 seginer 1967 steiner et al 1983 zheng et al 2018 while another research has indicated that the net interception loss for corn averaged only 0 2 mm and 0 1 mm per irrigation event averaged 21 5 mm during daytime and nighttime irrigation respectively martÃ­nez cob et al 2008 some studies on wheat have shown that the water interception ratio of wheat across the whole irrigation season was between 24 and 28 li and rao 2000 and the ratio of rainfall interception was 10 25 kontorshchikov and eremina 1963 kang et al 2005 found that wheat canopy interception was relatively low during the growing season between 0 3 mm and 1 0 mm per irrigation event 38 54 mm wang et al 2006 reported that canopy interception capacity of wheat ranged from 0 68 mm to 1 47 mm under different growth stages like wheat canopy interception capacity of alfalfa was reported to be 0 29 1 26 mm during a period of 5 45 days after regrowth jiao et al 2016 the total gross interception loss of alfalfa canopies for rainfall has been estimated at 21 6 of the total rainfall for the full growing season haynes 1940 and the average net interception loss during the irrigation season for alfalfa has been estimated around 2 9 of the total water supplied by a solid set sprinkler irrigation system stambouli et al 2013 however the aforementioned studies on alfalfa canopy interception were commonly conducted under rainfall and only a few was carried out under the solid set sprinkler irrigation accordingly the quantification of alfalfa canopy interception under center pivot irrigation systems still requires further research in sprinkler irrigation systems crop canopy interception can vary across conditions for example it strongly depends on 1 crop type growth stage planting density and other factors that can impact the leaf area index lai and plant height kozak et al 2007 2 meteorological factors such as wind speed temperature vapor pressure deficit and so on kang et al 2005 lockwood 1990 3 sprinkler type and irrigation duration which affect water application rate droplet diameter and irrigation depth kang et al 2005 lamm and manges 2000 in general crop canopy interception increases with plant height and lai canopy interception prediction models based on growth indices are effective jiao et al 2016 kang et al 2005 the impact of meteorological factors on canopy interception has been relative difficult to determine but some research has concluded that canopy interception decreases with wind speed kang et al 2005 and with temperature at least under certain conditions lockwood 1990 however most experiments have been conducted under windless low temperature conditions in order to eliminate the influence of in canopy evaporation the effects of water application rate on canopy interception are however different for example wang et al 2006 reported that application rate had no significant effect on canopy interception however jiao et al 2016 determined that canopy interception capacity increased with application rate and zhang et al 2015 confirmed that lower rainfall intensity increased the amount of rainfall intercepted in addition most research has indicated that the water partitioning process through the canopy can be affected by sprinkler type lamm and manges 2000 thompson et al 1997 lamm and manges 2000 reported that corn interception storage for a high pressure impact irrigation system was 2 06 mm which was higher than that of 1 85 mm for low pressure spray heads most center pivot irrigation systems in china use two kinds of low pressure sprinklers i e nelson r3000 and d3000 sprinklers which are classified as rotating spray plate sprinklers rsps and fixed spray plate sprinklers fsps respectively water jets hit a rotating deflector plate with grooves of multiple shapes angles and depth in the r3000 sprinkler while they hit a fixed deflector plate with grooves of a relatively uniform shape and angles in the d3000 sprinkler jiao et al 2017 the distinct spray plates can result in very different water application patterns and droplet size distributions of the sprinklers but how the two sprinklers affect the canopy interception has not yet been determined therefore studying the effects of sprinkler types on canopy interception remains an important research objective the objectives of this study were 1 to assess alfalfa canopy interception capacity and the dynamics of canopy interception across irrigation depths and 2 to determine how the sprinkler types nelson r3000 and d3000 sprinklers and crop growth indices impact canopy interception capacity together the fulfillment of these goals will help to develop better canopy interception prediction models 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at china agricultural university experimental station in 2017 and 2018 the station is located in the semi humid region of the north china plain in zhuozhou hebei province 39 27 n 115 51 e and has a typical temperate continental monsoon climate with a summer precipitation pattern the annual precipitation is about 560 mm 50 75 of which falls between july and august alfalfa cultivar wl363hq seed was sown on august 28 2015 with a row spacing of 30 cm and sowing rate of 22 5 kg ha 1 the spring green up began on march 27 2017 and april 5 2018 2 2 experimental design the alfalfa was irrigated with a center pivot irrigation system the experiment was conducted during the regrowth period of the fourth cutting of alfalfa from august 30 to september 27 2017 and over the whole growth season from april 5 to september 20 2018 in order to determine the influence of growth indices on canopy interception three alfalfa growth stages s1 early vegetative stage s2 late vegetative stage s3 bud stage were selected for measurement owing to the difficulty of measuring alfalfa canopy interception using the weighing method under an actual center pivot irrigation system with multiple sprinklers overlapping as potential water supplies canopy interception was measured under only a single sprinkler fixed at a position outdoors the effects of two sprinkler types on canopy interception both of which are commonly used sprinklers in china the nelson r3000 sprinkler equipped with a 12 groove brown plate and the d3000 sprinkler equipped with a 36 groove blue plate were assessed application rate and droplet diameter distribution characteristics of the two sprinklers were measured indoors before the field tests several researchers have shown that the water distribution for the d3000 sprinkler had very large variability in both circular and radial directions and most of water landed at the edge of the wetted area sayyadi et al 2014 yan et al 2010 whereas water was relatively more uniformly distributed for the r3000 sprinkler and mainly landed around the sprinkler jiao et al 2017 faci et al 2001 based on the results of previous studies and preliminary indoor tests typical interception measuring positions were chosen for both sprinklers to study the influence of sprinkler types on alfalfa canopy interception specifically measuring points were uniformly arranged radiating outwards 3 5 and 7 m from the r3000 sprinkler measurements that were referred to as r3000 3 m r3000 5 m and r3000 7 m respectively as the water was mainly distributed between 5 5 m and 7 5 m from the d3000 sprinkler details in section 3 1 distances of 6 m and 7 m from the sprinkler were selected referred to as d3000 6 m and d3000 7 m respectively the average of the canopy interception at typical positions was used to represent the canopy interception for the measured sprinkler during each measurement canopy interception was recorded for every 1 mm of irrigation depth and the total irrigation depth was set at 8 mm because canopy interception for alfalfa which regrew for 5 45 days tends to stabilize after the irrigation depth exceeds 6 8 mm jiao et al 2016 2 3 measurement parameters 2 3 1 application rate and droplet diameter of sprinklers the water distributions of the two types of sprinkler were measured using the automatic testing system catch cans were arranged in a ray centered on the sprinkler the horizontal spacing between the first catch can and the tested sprinkler was 1 m other catch cans were spaced 0 5 m apart the weight of water in catch cans can be automatically collected and the instantaneous application rates can be generated subsequently the duration of application rate measurement was half an hour the droplet diameters of the sprinkler were measured using the two dimensional video disdrometer 2dvd joanneum research graz austria which worked on a three dimensional video particle measurement principle the measurement points of water droplet diameter were also set along the radial lines with 1 m intervals for each sprinkler the number of water droplets assessed was no less than 1000 for each measurement point and the droplet diameter was calculated using the volume weighted average method both sprinklers were equipped with 20 psi pressure regulators and 35 nozzles diameter 6 95 mm and were assessed at a 1 m height above the measuring device in addition water flow from the d3000 sprinkler was divided into 36 fixed discrete streams the water distribution patterns for different streams were similar in order to easily conduct the measurements one typical water stream was chosen to measure the application rate droplet diameter and the canopy interception all catch cans and 2dvd measurement points were located along the center line of the water stream 2 3 2 canopy interception a canopy interception measurement system based on the weighing method described by wang et al 2006 and mauch et al 2008 was constructed adjacent to the tested center pivot irrigation system in this study as shown in fig 1 a this system mainly consisted of four elements sprinkler alfalfa sample electronic balance and data collection system the studied sprinkler was installed at 1 m above the top of the alfalfa canopy a valve was installed at the inlet of the water supply meanwhile a pressure gauge was installed downstream of the valve to monitor the working pressure the alfalfa samples were composed of alfalfa plants inserted into a roof shaped 40 cm 40 cm foam board that was designed to be high in the middle and low on the both sides in order to drain the stemflow and throughfall during the measurements a row of holes was punched into the foam for the insertion of alfalfa plants along the edge with a spacing of about 5 cm of the lower side of the foam board the alfalfa sample was weighed using an electronic balance with a maximum measuring range of 30 kg and an accuracy of 0 1 g the data collection system consisted of a wireless data receiver and a computer which could transmit and record data in real time in addition the actual application rate for each measuring position was observed outdoors using 21 5 cm diameter catch cans owing to differences in water distribution between d3000 and r3000 sprinklers the arrangement of catch cans varied between the two sprinkler types considering the uniform distribution of water along the circumference for the r3000 sprinkler three catch cans were arranged along the sprinkler s circumference near the canopy interception measuring area as shown in fig 1 b meanwhile the water collection by catch cans was conducted simultaneously with the canopy interception measurements however water from the d3000 sprinkler was divided into several discrete streams a single water stream can only cover an area of 0 20 to 0 3 m wide yan et al 2010 which results in no water being distributed on some parts of the 40 cm 40 cm interception measuring area thus two adjacent catch cans were arranged in the measuring area in order to avoid the overestimation of application rate by arranging one catch can under the water stream fig 1 c furthermore because the arrangement of catch cans coincided with the canopy interception measuring area application rates could only be measured after canopy interception experiments were concluded to avoid the impact of in canopy evaporation on canopy interception measurements experiments were conducted either before 8 30 or after 17 30 during the measurement period wind speed was no more than 0 5 m s 1 the average temperature was 22 3 c and the average reference evapotranspiration et o was only 0 06 mm h 1 especially after 17 30 the mean et o was only 0 014 mm h 1 in addition each measurement was 0 5 2 h in duration most of the longer duration tests were conducted after 17 30 and some 0 5 h experiments were conducted before 8 30 consequently the total et o was less than 0 03 mm during the experiment and the in canopy evaporation could be neglected all of the measurements were repeated three times alfalfa samples were prepared before each test initially the foam board was fully soaked in water in order to make the weight of board consistent before and after irrigation and to keep alfalfa plants fresh during the measurements next alfalfa plants were sampled from the field using scissors to cut all the plant material above 3 cm from ground level the sampling area was 30 cm 40 cm all of the sampled alfalfa plants were inserted immediately into the saturated foam board besides water should be sprayed around the foam board and not be sprayed on the plants before we measure the canopy interception then the foam board with alfalfa plants was promptly placed on an electronic balance which was connected to a computer through the wireless data receiver to observe the weight of the sample in real time subsequently the experimental irrigation was started and the initial weight of the foam board with alfalfa plants was recorded as w 0 before irrigation after the irrigation depth was increased by an increment of 1 mm the water supply was temporarily stopped for 1 min in order to eliminate the impact of the droplet kinetic energy and discharge the throughfall and stemflow and then the weight of alfalfa samples at irrigation depth i mm was recorded as wi for i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 owing to the neglect of in canopy evaporation as well as the loss of the throughfall and stemflow changes in the weight of alfalfa samples consisted only of the weight of water intercepted by the alfalfa canopy the canopy interception was calculated using the following equation 1 i i Î´ w a Ï w w i w 0 30 40 10 here ii is the alfalfa canopy interception mm at irrigation depth i mm Î´w

tend to be stable and reach the maximum with the increase of irrigation depth the maximum value of canopy interception is recorded as im which is also considered as the canopy interception capacity to evaluate the variation in canopy interception for a given irrigation depth the proportion of canopy interception at irrigation depth i mm to the maximum canopy interception was defined as pi which is calculated as follows 2 p i i i i m 100 the interception ratio is calculated as follows 3 i r i i i i 100 here iri is the alfalfa canopy interception ratio at irrigation depth i mm 2 3 3 growth indices the plant height and leaf area index lai of alfalfa were measured after each experiment ten plants were selected randomly from the sampled alfalfa plants for measurement with a ruler lai was measured according to the principle of specific gravity after each measurement all sampled alfalfa plants were allowed to air dry in a cool place to evaporate the water from them within 1 2 h then the fresh weight of the total sampled alfalfa plants was recorded as m 1 subsequently ten plants were randomly selected and their stems and leaves were separated in order to calculate the stem to leaf ratio r thirty randomly selected leaves from ten plants were weighted to determine m 2 referred to below lastly thirty leaves were scanned to obtain the total leaf area of 30 leaves a 1 below using the image processing software adobe photoshop cc the total leaf area la cm2 of alfalfa can be calculated as follows 4 l a m 1 1 r a 1 m 2 the leaf area index can be calculated as follows 5 l a i l a a here la is the total leaf area cm2 and a is the sampling area of alfalfa cm2 2 4 statistical analysis the differences in alfalfa canopy interception capacity im under different growth stages and at different measurement positions were tested using one way analysis of variance anova assessed as significant at the p 0 05 level however the differences in im values under different application rates and droplet diameters were subjected to independent sample t tests again assessed as significant at the p 0 05 level the correlation between alfalfa canopy interception capacity and each variable plant height lai plant fresh weight etc was analyzed using pearson correlation in order to establish a model for predicting im and iri multiple regression analysis was applied with a stepwise regression model the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse between the predicted and observed values were used to test the goodness of fit of the regression models higher values of r 2 and lower values of rmse and nrmse correspond to higher accuracy of the model in predicting im and iri zheng et al 2018 the statistical data analyses and graphs were prepared with spss 20 0 analytical software ibm corp armonk ny usa and origin 8 1 software originlab northampton ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance of sprinklers application rates and droplet diameter distributions differed dramatically between the r3000 and d3000 sprinklers fig 2 the indoor testing results demonstrated that the r3000 instantaneous application rate increased with distance until 2 5 m maximum of 23 8 mm h 1 from the sprinkler and then decreased gradually with the distance to the sprinkler 0 6 mm h 1 the d3000 instantaneous application rate remained constant and very low minimum of 0 4 mm h 1 until 6 m from the sprinkler and then rapidly increased until 7 5 m from the sprinkler to get the maximum around 312 6 mm h 1 and then sharply decreased again to the minimum 0 41 mm h 1 at 8 m remaining to approximately 10 m with constant and low values water sprayed by the d3000 sprinkler was mainly concentrated within between 5 5 m and 7 5 m from the sprinkler which was similar to the water distribution reported by yan et al 2010 consistent with results reported by faci et al 2001 and jiao et al 2017 water was distributed more uniformly along the radius for the r3000 sprinkler compared with the d3000 sprinkler the different characteristics of the r3000 and d3000 sprinklers in application rate could be explained by the divergent droplet size distributions of the two sprinklers as shown in fig 2 b the volume mean droplet diameters of both sprinklers increased with distance from the sprinkler meanwhile the volume mean droplet diameter of the r3000 was slightly higher than that of the d3000 between 1 and 5 m from the sprinkler and became similar to that of the d3000 at a range of 5 7 m from the sprinkler to better understand the droplet diameter distributions the percentage of droplets smaller than a given diameter was previously assessed and fitted with the following model li et al 1994 6 p v 100 1 exp a d d 50 n here pv represents the cumulative volume percentage of droplets less than a given diameter of d d represents an individual droplet diameter mm d50 represents the median droplet diameter which is droplet diameter corresponding to the pv of 50 mm and a and n represent regression parameters as shown in fig 2 c the d3000 sprinkler s range of droplet diameter variation was much smaller than that of the r3000 sprinkler in agreement with results reported by faci et al 2001 the pv values corresponding to droplet diameters of 2 mm and 3 5 mm for the d3000 sprinkler were 8 69 and 96 25 respectively this indicated that the volume of droplets with diameters of 2 3 5 mm which were mainly distributed across distances of 5 7 m from the sprinkler fig 2 b accounted for 87 56 of the total volume thus the application rate for the d3000 sprinkler was considerable in that narrow sector however the pv value corresponding to a droplet diameter of 2 mm for the r3000 sprinkler was 82 62 which indicated that most water was distributed at a distance within 5 m of the sprinkler when combined with the result illustrated in fig 2 b in addition the median droplet diameter and the volume mean droplet diameter for the r3000 sprinkler were 1 2 mm and 1 6 mm respectively both of which were smaller than the corresponding 2 86 mm and 2 96 mm values for the d3000 sprinkler in order to determine the actual irrigation depth during the canopy interception measurement the application rates for all selected positions were measured outdoors table 1 the d3000 7 m application rate measured outdoors was lower than that measured indoors fig 2 a which was partly due to some water evaporation outdoors on the other hand it demonstrated that application rate over the whole measuring area could be overestimated with only one catch can placed under the water stream in this study only outdoor application rates were used for analyses as shown in table 1 application rates were significantly different among the measuring positions except for r3000 3 m and d3000 6 m similarly a remarkable difference was found in the droplet diameters among the measuring positions except for r3000 7 m and d3000 7 m consequently the r3000 3 m and d3000 6 m measurements were chosen to assess the effect of droplet diameter on canopy interception and the r3000 7 m and d3000 7 m measurements were chosen to study the influence of application rate 3 2 dynamics of alfalfa canopy interception across irrigation depths the alfalfa canopy interception for the two sprinklers at the observed positions changed similarly with irrigation depth across the different growth stages fig 3 generally the alfalfa canopy interception had an initial rapid increase and then stabilized as irrigation depth increased which was consistent with the results of previous studies wang et al 2006 jiao et al 2016 in the rapid growth phase when the irrigation depth reached 2 mm pi values reached 75 66 81 00 as the irrigation depth continued to increase the alfalfa canopy reached saturation and maximum canopy interception im was obtained after irrigation depth exceeded 2 mm 3 mm and 4 mm at the s1 s2 and s3 stages respectively the irrigation depths of 2 mm 3 mm and 4 mm were the minimum irrigation depths for achieving the alfalfa canopy capacity at the s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively which have been suggested for foliar fertilization via a sprinkler systems in order to deliver more fertilizer that is essentially stored on the leaves water was more likely to be intercepted by the canopy in the initial period of irrigation probably owing to the discrete distribution of the small water droplets on the initially dry leaves and stems which was conductive to water retention as progressively more small droplets landed on the leaves or stems and accumulated into large droplets some water fell from the canopy leading to a reduction in the rate of increase of canopy interception to better quantify the dynamic process of alfalfa canopy interception a nonlinear regression analysis of alfalfa canopy interception ii and irrigation depth i was conducted the ii value may be zero at an irrigation depth of zero since irrigation has not occurred at an irrigation depth of zero as the irrigation depth approaches infinity however ii tends toward im based on the variation characteristics the following exponential model was developed 7 i i i m 1 e k i here ii represents the canopy interception at irrigation depth i mm and im is the maximum canopy interception mm this model was similar to the models presented by merriam 1960 and jiao et al 2016 fig 4 demonstrated that eq 7 fitted well with measurement data for all cases and the r 2 value of this model ranged from 0 615 to 0 976 furthermore the calculated im value was very similar to the measured maximum canopy interception with the relative error between 0 06 and 6 47 in this model coefficient k represents the variation in canopy interception according to eqs 2 and 7 pi can be calculated as follow 8 p i 1 e k i eq 8 indicated that pi increased with k thus for larger k values canopy interception capacity is more easily reached and im can be reached at lower irrigation depths meanwhile k was affected by the hydraulic performance of sprinklers and alfalfa growth stage jiao et al 2016 the average k value for the r3000 sprinkler 0 902 was 1 27 times larger than that for the d3000 sprinkler 0 713 this illustrated that water emitted by r3000 sprinklers was more prone to be intercepted by canopies than that by d3000 sprinklers that might be because the droplet diameter from r3000 sprinklers was smaller than that for d3000 sprinklers and the rate of wetting was greater for small volume droplets calder 1996 additionally the average k value of the alfalfa growth stages s1 s2 and s3 were 0 713 0 977 and 0 790 respectively thus the rate of increase for canopy interception at the s2 growth stage was largest a possible result of the canopy structure with large and sparse leaves however the exact relationship between k and the hydraulic performance of sprinklers or alfalfa growth stage could not be determined in this study 3 3 dynamics of canopy interception ratio across irrigation depths the interception ratio of alfalfa canopies decreased as irrigation depth increased across growth stages and measuring positions fig 4 which indicated that lower irrigation depths or smaller rainfall events contributed to a higher percentage of canopy interception as previously reported by zheng et al 2018 and zhang et al 2015 across all measurements the maximum interception ratio irm was reached at a minimum irrigation depth of 1 mm which increased with the growth stage of the alfalfa with irm values of 18 3 31 42 42 86 56 48 and 66 26 94 80 for the s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively this indicated that during the initial irrigation little water was intercepted by early vegetation stage canopies with low canopy coverage resulting in high stemflow and throughfall percentages conversely because the canopy coverage was nearly full at the bud stage little water passed through the canopy immediately and was intercepted by it across the different measuring positions the interception ratio at the r3000 3 m position was remarkably higher than that at other positions probably owing to the smallest droplet diameters being observed at this position furthermore according to eq 7 the interception ratio iri could be calculated using the following function model 9 i r i i m 1 e k i i 100 here i represents irrigation depth mm im represents canopy interception capacity mm and k is a coefficient for each alfalfa growth stage and measuring position assessed in this study the im and k values were known and the interception ratio for each irrigation depth was calculated using eq 9 the actual measured interception ratio across the different growth stages and measuring positions were used to validate the accuracy of the model comparisons revealed that this model agreed well with the measured results rmse 1 44 nrmse 4 96 and the average relative error was 2 66 accordingly interception ratio across different irrigation depths could be predicted using eq 9 for alfalfa under the experimental conditions of this study generally the irrigation depth applied for alfalfa ranged from 10 to 40 mm by the center pivot irrigation system in this study the interception ratio calculated with eq 9 across irrigation depths of 10 20 30 40 mm ranged from 2 2 8 9 and averaged 4 63 which was higher than the net interception loss averaged 2 9 of 21 1 mm reported by stambouli et al 2013 and similar to the gross interception loss averaged 7 2 of 10 mm reported by jiao et al 2016 however compared with the gross interception loss of corn averaged 21 6 of 23 08 mm reported previously by zheng et al 2018 the gross interception loss for alfalfa in the present study was much lower which might be owing to the low wettability of alfalfa leaf surface urrego pereira et al 2013 weiss 1988 3 4 canopy interception capacity of alfalfa at different growth stages canopy interception measurement was stopped when the irrigation depth reached 8 mm and the canopy interception capacity had been obtained under different measurement positions and sprinklers fig 3 consequently the canopy interception capacity and interception ratio at an irrigation depth of 8 mm were further analyzed as growth stage increased the canopy interception capacity and interception ratio of alfalfa significantly increased p 0 05 table 2 the im values were 0 46 mm 0 81 mm and 1 49 mm for the s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively the fresh weight of alfalfa plant height and lai also increased significantly with the growth stages p 0 05 table 2 the fresh weight and plant height were both the important indices to characterize the lai actually the increase in im as alfalfa grew can be mainly ascribed to the significant increase in lai overall the alfalfa canopy interception capacity range was in accordance with the results 0 29 1 26 mm of previous studies jiao et al 2016 which was much smaller than interception loss estimated in forests 0 31 5 14 mm for pine or shrubs 0 36 4 50 mm for caragana korshinskii or 0 75 5 29 mm for artemisia ordosica crockford and richardson 2000 zhang et al 2015 the canopy interception capacity of alfalfa was similar to that of winter wheat using the same weighing method 0 68 1 47 mm but was lower than that of corn 1 8 2 7 mm this variation in interception capacity between alfalfa and other plants might be owing to obvious differences in canopy characteristics the plant height of forest or shrubs was much higher than that of alfalfa which might increase water interception by stems kang et al 2005 the maize leaf surface corrugated waxy and covered with tomentum was more wettable water contact angles from 60 80 the alfalfa leaf surface relatively smooth and waxy was more hydrophobic water contact angles 120 urrego pereira et al 2013 weiss 1988 the higher leaf wettability and plant height of maize resulted in higher interception although the lai of alfalfa in this study was higher than that of maize zheng et al 2018 winter wheat a small densely planted crop has a canopy structure lai of 3 5 8 cm2 cm 2 plant height of 42 78 cm water contact angles 120 similar to that of alfalfa which appears to have resulted in similar canopy interception capacities kang et al 2005 netting and von 1973 in addition the interception ratio of alfalfa with the total irrigation depth around 8 mm was 5 27 9 15 and 17 59 for the s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively the interception ratio at stage of s3 was lower than that of forests 33 12 higher than that of shrubs 11 3 and similar to that of corn 17 1 at the gross precipitation or irrigation depth of 8 mm crockford and richardson 2000 carlyle moses 2004 zheng et al 2018 the difference in interception ratio among plants might be related to the dynamics of canopy interception across irrigation depths or cumulative precipitation levels for example the interception loss for shrubs was higher than that for alfalfa but the precipitation level needed to reach im was higher than that for alfalfa leading to the lower interception ratio observed for shrubs overall the canopy interception capacity of alfalfa at the bud growth stage is higher than that of the other two stages 3 5 effect of hydraulic performance of sprinklers on canopy interception capacity the alfalfa canopy interception capacity of different growth stages all decreased with the distance from sprinklers table 3 the largest im value for the d3000 sprinkler appeared 6 m from the sprinkler 0 45 mm 1 57 mm and that of r3000 appeared 3 m from the sprinkler 0 54 mm 1 61 mm however the im values at different measuring positions differed non significantly during the early vegetative stage p 0 05 but differed remarkably during the late vegetative stage and bud stage p 0 05 and the r3000 3 m im value was uniformly highest in order to determine the effects of application rate and droplet diameter on canopy interception capacity the im value for r3000 3 m r3000 7 m d3000 6 m and d3000 7 m were chosen for further analysis table 4 based on the comparison of the im values between r3000 7 m and d3000 7 m application rate had no significant influence on alfalfa canopy capacity p 0 05 this was in accordance with results reported by wang et al 2006 and kang et al 2005 but this contrasted with results from other studies jiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 the differences among the results might be attributed to the complex influence of application rate on canopy interception the kinetic energy intensity on leaf surface increased with the application rate which can result in the observed decrease in canopy interception however the increase of measuring duration as application rate decreased may provide more time for droplets to fall from the canopy which can also reduce canopy interception these conflicting tendencies lead to insignificant effects of application rate on canopy interception furthermore the comparison of im values between r3000 3 m and d3000 6 m showed that im decreased as droplet diameter increased but the difference was only significant at the s2 growth stage p 0 05 in agreement with results reported by kang et al 2005 meanwhile calder 1996 pointed out that the reduction in maximum canopy storage with increasing drop size can be attributed to drop kinetic energy thus droplet diameter appears to have been a main factor influencing the canopy interception capacity owing to hydraulic performance differences between d3000 and r3000 sprinklers the canopy capacity under the two types of sprinkler also differed as shown in table 3 the average im of the r3000 sprinkler was significantly greater than that of the d3000 sprinkler in the early vegetative and bud stages p 0 05 however no significant difference existed among the average im values of the two sprinklers at the late vegetative stage this might due to the significant decrease of im at r3000 7 m 0 62 mm which reduced the average im for r3000 sprinklers at the s2 stage table 3 the reduction of im at r3000 7 m was owing to the larger water droplet 2 79 mm on one hand on the other hand the lower application rate 5 16 mm h 1 at this position resulted in longer measuring duration 98 min due to the lower content of cellulose and lignin alfalfa stems were relatively weaker at the vegetative stage bozickovic et al 2014 kokubo et al 1991 the weaker stems and the higher plant height 0 47 m relative to the 0 11 m at early vegetative stage led to the slight bending of the upper part of alfalfa stems at late vegetative stage during the long time measurement this change of canopy structure also reduced the im to some extent actually the measured im at r3000 7 m for the s2 stage would be slightly lower than that of the original canopy structure however considering that the alfalfa lodging would also occur during long time irrigation in the real world and the measuring error of im due to the stem bending could be acceptable in fact there will be physiological wilting once alfalfa plants were cut however the alfalfa plants were immediately inserted into the saturated foam board and the wilting was unobservable generally there would be little difference between the measured canopy interception and that in the real world with the low speed wind and temperature wind speed less than 0 5 m s the average temperature of 22 3 overall the canopy interception capacity of alfalfa under the r3000 springer was larger than that under the d3000 sprinkler which might be owing to the smaller volume mean droplet diameter produced by the r3000 sprinkler in addition the results in the present study were obtained based on the assessment of the individual fixed sprinkler which might be slightly different from those under the moving sprinkler irrigation system in the real world therefore more subsequent research should be conducted with the actual center pivot irrigation systems using the two types of sprinklers 3 6 effect of alfalfa growth indices on canopy interception capacity the fresh weight lai and plant height of alfalfa had significant p 0 01 positive correlations with canopy interception capacity at different measuring positions table 5 in good agreement with results reported by wang et al 2006 zheng et al 2018 and kang et al 2005 this confirmed that alfalfa canopy interception capacity was closely related to canopy structure with alfalfa growth stage development plant height leaf area and fresh weight all increased resulting in more water being intercepted by larger leaves and higher stems overall the correlation coefficients describing the relationships of canopy interception capacity with fresh weight lai and plant height were 0 873 0 863 and 0 906 respectively portions of the measurement results were used for quadratic multiple regression analysis a stepwise regression model was also applied at the beginning of the regression analysis the total fresh weight plant height and lai were all considered to conduct the regression however the growth indices were related to each other and some of the variables were not independent after removal of the insignificant independent variables using a stepwise regression procedure the regression equation with only plant height was generated as shown in the following equation 10 i m 4 682 h 2 1 711 h 0 597 r 2 0 912 here im represents the alfalfa canopy capacity mm and h is the plant height m h 0 05 m plant height was the only main factor in the regression model resembling the result of the regression analysis between corn stemflow and other plant variables reported by lamm et al 2000 meanwhile plant height as a more readily available indicator was quite suitable for the prediction of the canopy interception capacity generally alfalfa stubble height was no less than 5 cm after each harvest monson 1966 sparrow and masiak 2008 therefore plant height applicable to the eq 10 should exceed 5 cm as shown in fig 5 the im value calculated using eq 10 agreed well with the measured data and the r 2 rmse and nrmse values were 0 912 0 09 mm and 9 10 respectively consequently the predicted model based only on plant height was relatively reliable and eq 10 is therefore recommended for predicting alfalfa im values 4 conclusions alfalfa canopy interception initially increased rapidly and then stabilized across irrigation depths irrigation depths of 2 mm 3 mm and 4 mm were the minimum irrigation depths for achieving alfalfa canopy capacity im at s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively both alfalfa canopy interception capacity and interception ratio significantly increased as growth stage developed p 0 05 the im values were 0 46 mm 0 81 mm and 1 49 mm for s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively at an irrigation depth of about 8 mm the interception rates of alfalfa were 5 27 9 15 and 17 59 for the three growth stages respectively application rate had no significant effect on the im p 0 05 while im decreased as droplet diameter increased overall the im of alfalfa was reached more quickly when the r3000 sprinkler was used and im was smaller for the d3000 sprinkler however the results were conducted with single sprinkler under the static conditions and more research should be carried out under the moving sprinkler irrigation system to verify it fresh weight plant height and lai had significantly p 0 01 positive correlations with canopy interception capacity the models for the dynamics of alfalfa canopy interception and interception ratio across irrigation depths were developed and fitted well with the actual empirical results accordingly a reliable model that included only the primary factor of plant height was also demonstrated to predict canopy interception capacity well because the canopy interception capacity has important influence on the water use efficiency and the foliar fertilization application effects the quantitative analysis of the alfalfa canopy interception under different low pressure sprinklers in this study can provide valuable and basic information for irrigation schedules and fertigation in alfalfa

10753,canopy water interception is an important factor in water use efficiency analysis and sprinkler based fertigation technique development in the present study alfalfa canopy water interception and its influence factors were assessed under low wind conditions the canopy interception capacity for three growth stages of alfalfa s1 early vegetative stage s2 late vegetative stage s3 bud stage were measured under two types of low pressure spray sprinklers the dynamics of canopy interception and interception ratio with irrigation depth were also observed the total irrigation depth for all measurements was around 8 mm a weight based canopy interception measurement device was installed outdoors and integrated with a 20 psi sprinkler at 1 m above the canopy the alfalfa canopy interception first increased rapidly with irrigation depth but then stabilized and reached canopy interception capacity i m the minimum irrigation depths to achieve the i m values were 2 mm 3 mm and 4 mm at the s1 s2 and s3 stages respectively i m increased significantly across growth stages and ranged from 0 46 mm to 1 49 mm interception ratio decreased gradually as irrigation depth increased with an approximately 8 mm total irrigation depth interception ratio ranged from 5 27 to 17 59 over all growth stages water application rate had no effect on i m and i m decreased with droplet diameter generally i m was higher and reached more quickly with the r3000 sprinkler compared to the d3000 sprinkler fresh weight plant height and lai of alfalfa had significant positive correlations with canopy interception capacity and a quadratic regression model was developed with using plant height as a factor this study provides valuable and basic information for irrigation schedules and fertigation in alfalfa cultivation keywords canopy interception alfalfa growth stage irrigation depth low pressure sprinkler 1 introduction alfalfa a major forage crop has been increasingly planted in the arid and semi arid regions of northern china li and su 2017 in these areas water resources and soil nutrient content are too low to meet the high demands of alfalfa lamm et al 2012 to efficiently supply water and nutrients center pivot irrigation systems have been widely applied to alfalfa agriculture in these areas owing to their advantages in irrigation efficiency fertigation coverage area application uniformity and labor costs gascho and hook 1991 li et al 2017 o shaughnessy et al 2016 under sprinkler irrigation systems canopy interception of water mostly evaporates into the atmosphere manifests as interception losses which plays an important role in water use efficiency and parameter determination for irrigation scheduling dunkerley 2000 seginer 1967 uddin et al 2016 however other research has indicated that canopy interception will lead to the reduction of crop transpiration rate compared with non wetted canopies burgy and pomeroy 1958 tolk et al 1995 water evaporation from canopy interception can also reduce the vapor pressure deficit and air temperature thereby modifying field microclimates liu and kang 2006 additionally canopy interception plays an important role in developing foliar fertilization techniques because the volume of water stored by crop leaves can influence total fertilization amounts and fertilizer solution concentrations maximizing fertilizer solution interception is a primary requisite to ensure the effectiveness of the foliar fertilization application and the maximum canopy interception can be used to advice about the adequate foliar fertilization spray amount besides the higher salt solution concentration can sometimes result in leaf damage fageria et al 2009 and the canopy interception combined with fertilizer amount can be applied to determine the fertilizer solution concentrations therefore understanding canopy interception can inform both irrigation and fertigation practices lamm and manges 2000 canopy interception is the amount of water temporarily remaining on plants after irrigation or rainfall lamm and manges 2000 generally water intercepted by the canopy will subsequently evaporate into the atmosphere which is considered as the gross interception loss tolk et al 1995 uddin et al 2016 while the suppression of crop transpiration from the wetted canopy as compared to a non wetted canopy can be subtracted from the gross interception loss to calculate the net interception loss tolk et al 1995 during a long period of rainfall or irrigation canopy interception gradually tends to stabilize burgy and pomeroy 1958 jiao et al 2016 the maximum static value of canopy interception after cessation of sprinkler irrigation or rainfall is referred to as canopy interception capacity uddin et al 2016 most research about canopy interception has mainly focused on forest ecosystems and shrubs in order to analyze the hydrologic cycle carlyle moses 2004 gavazzi et al 2016 and zhang et al 2015 studies on canopy interception of field crops have seldom been published and the existing studies have mainly focused on corn and wheat most results have shown that the average amount of corn canopy interception ranged from 1 8 mm to 2 7 mm during the whole growth stages under sprinkler irrigation system with an average gross interception loss of approximately 12 23 lamm and manges 2000 seginer 1967 steiner et al 1983 zheng et al 2018 while another research has indicated that the net interception loss for corn averaged only 0 2 mm and 0 1 mm per irrigation event averaged 21 5 mm during daytime and nighttime irrigation respectively martÃ­nez cob et al 2008 some studies on wheat have shown that the water interception ratio of wheat across the whole irrigation season was between 24 and 28 li and rao 2000 and the ratio of rainfall interception was 10 25 kontorshchikov and eremina 1963 kang et al 2005 found that wheat canopy interception was relatively low during the growing season between 0 3 mm and 1 0 mm per irrigation event 38 54 mm wang et al 2006 reported that canopy interception capacity of wheat ranged from 0 68 mm to 1 47 mm under different growth stages like wheat canopy interception capacity of alfalfa was reported to be 0 29 1 26 mm during a period of 5 45 days after regrowth jiao et al 2016 the total gross interception loss of alfalfa canopies for rainfall has been estimated at 21 6 of the total rainfall for the full growing season haynes 1940 and the average net interception loss during the irrigation season for alfalfa has been estimated around 2 9 of the total water supplied by a solid set sprinkler irrigation system stambouli et al 2013 however the aforementioned studies on alfalfa canopy interception were commonly conducted under rainfall and only a few was carried out under the solid set sprinkler irrigation accordingly the quantification of alfalfa canopy interception under center pivot irrigation systems still requires further research in sprinkler irrigation systems crop canopy interception can vary across conditions for example it strongly depends on 1 crop type growth stage planting density and other factors that can impact the leaf area index lai and plant height kozak et al 2007 2 meteorological factors such as wind speed temperature vapor pressure deficit and so on kang et al 2005 lockwood 1990 3 sprinkler type and irrigation duration which affect water application rate droplet diameter and irrigation depth kang et al 2005 lamm and manges 2000 in general crop canopy interception increases with plant height and lai canopy interception prediction models based on growth indices are effective jiao et al 2016 kang et al 2005 the impact of meteorological factors on canopy interception has been relative difficult to determine but some research has concluded that canopy interception decreases with wind speed kang et al 2005 and with temperature at least under certain conditions lockwood 1990 however most experiments have been conducted under windless low temperature conditions in order to eliminate the influence of in canopy evaporation the effects of water application rate on canopy interception are however different for example wang et al 2006 reported that application rate had no significant effect on canopy interception however jiao et al 2016 determined that canopy interception capacity increased with application rate and zhang et al 2015 confirmed that lower rainfall intensity increased the amount of rainfall intercepted in addition most research has indicated that the water partitioning process through the canopy can be affected by sprinkler type lamm and manges 2000 thompson et al 1997 lamm and manges 2000 reported that corn interception storage for a high pressure impact irrigation system was 2 06 mm which was higher than that of 1 85 mm for low pressure spray heads most center pivot irrigation systems in china use two kinds of low pressure sprinklers i e nelson r3000 and d3000 sprinklers which are classified as rotating spray plate sprinklers rsps and fixed spray plate sprinklers fsps respectively water jets hit a rotating deflector plate with grooves of multiple shapes angles and depth in the r3000 sprinkler while they hit a fixed deflector plate with grooves of a relatively uniform shape and angles in the d3000 sprinkler jiao et al 2017 the distinct spray plates can result in very different water application patterns and droplet size distributions of the sprinklers but how the two sprinklers affect the canopy interception has not yet been determined therefore studying the effects of sprinkler types on canopy interception remains an important research objective the objectives of this study were 1 to assess alfalfa canopy interception capacity and the dynamics of canopy interception across irrigation depths and 2 to determine how the sprinkler types nelson r3000 and d3000 sprinklers and crop growth indices impact canopy interception capacity together the fulfillment of these goals will help to develop better canopy interception prediction models 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at china agricultural university experimental station in 2017 and 2018 the station is located in the semi humid region of the north china plain in zhuozhou hebei province 39 27 n 115 51 e and has a typical temperate continental monsoon climate with a summer precipitation pattern the annual precipitation is about 560 mm 50 75 of which falls between july and august alfalfa cultivar wl363hq seed was sown on august 28 2015 with a row spacing of 30 cm and sowing rate of 22 5 kg ha 1 the spring green up began on march 27 2017 and april 5 2018 2 2 experimental design the alfalfa was irrigated with a center pivot irrigation system the experiment was conducted during the regrowth period of the fourth cutting of alfalfa from august 30 to september 27 2017 and over the whole growth season from april 5 to september 20 2018 in order to determine the influence of growth indices on canopy interception three alfalfa growth stages s1 early vegetative stage s2 late vegetative stage s3 bud stage were selected for measurement owing to the difficulty of measuring alfalfa canopy interception using the weighing method under an actual center pivot irrigation system with multiple sprinklers overlapping as potential water supplies canopy interception was measured under only a single sprinkler fixed at a position outdoors the effects of two sprinkler types on canopy interception both of which are commonly used sprinklers in china the nelson r3000 sprinkler equipped with a 12 groove brown plate and the d3000 sprinkler equipped with a 36 groove blue plate were assessed application rate and droplet diameter distribution characteristics of the two sprinklers were measured indoors before the field tests several researchers have shown that the water distribution for the d3000 sprinkler had very large variability in both circular and radial directions and most of water landed at the edge of the wetted area sayyadi et al 2014 yan et al 2010 whereas water was relatively more uniformly distributed for the r3000 sprinkler and mainly landed around the sprinkler jiao et al 2017 faci et al 2001 based on the results of previous studies and preliminary indoor tests typical interception measuring positions were chosen for both sprinklers to study the influence of sprinkler types on alfalfa canopy interception specifically measuring points were uniformly arranged radiating outwards 3 5 and 7 m from the r3000 sprinkler measurements that were referred to as r3000 3 m r3000 5 m and r3000 7 m respectively as the water was mainly distributed between 5 5 m and 7 5 m from the d3000 sprinkler details in section 3 1 distances of 6 m and 7 m from the sprinkler were selected referred to as d3000 6 m and d3000 7 m respectively the average of the canopy interception at typical positions was used to represent the canopy interception for the measured sprinkler during each measurement canopy interception was recorded for every 1 mm of irrigation depth and the total irrigation depth was set at 8 mm because canopy interception for alfalfa which regrew for 5 45 days tends to stabilize after the irrigation depth exceeds 6 8 mm jiao et al 2016 2 3 measurement parameters 2 3 1 application rate and droplet diameter of sprinklers the water distributions of the two types of sprinkler were measured using the automatic testing system catch cans were arranged in a ray centered on the sprinkler the horizontal spacing between the first catch can and the tested sprinkler was 1 m other catch cans were spaced 0 5 m apart the weight of water in catch cans can be automatically collected and the instantaneous application rates can be generated subsequently the duration of application rate measurement was half an hour the droplet diameters of the sprinkler were measured using the two dimensional video disdrometer 2dvd joanneum research graz austria which worked on a three dimensional video particle measurement principle the measurement points of water droplet diameter were also set along the radial lines with 1 m intervals for each sprinkler the number of water droplets assessed was no less than 1000 for each measurement point and the droplet diameter was calculated using the volume weighted average method both sprinklers were equipped with 20 psi pressure regulators and 35 nozzles diameter 6 95 mm and were assessed at a 1 m height above the measuring device in addition water flow from the d3000 sprinkler was divided into 36 fixed discrete streams the water distribution patterns for different streams were similar in order to easily conduct the measurements one typical water stream was chosen to measure the application rate droplet diameter and the canopy interception all catch cans and 2dvd measurement points were located along the center line of the water stream 2 3 2 canopy interception a canopy interception measurement system based on the weighing method described by wang et al 2006 and mauch et al 2008 was constructed adjacent to the tested center pivot irrigation system in this study as shown in fig 1 a this system mainly consisted of four elements sprinkler alfalfa sample electronic balance and data collection system the studied sprinkler was installed at 1 m above the top of the alfalfa canopy a valve was installed at the inlet of the water supply meanwhile a pressure gauge was installed downstream of the valve to monitor the working pressure the alfalfa samples were composed of alfalfa plants inserted into a roof shaped 40 cm 40 cm foam board that was designed to be high in the middle and low on the both sides in order to drain the stemflow and throughfall during the measurements a row of holes was punched into the foam for the insertion of alfalfa plants along the edge with a spacing of about 5 cm of the lower side of the foam board the alfalfa sample was weighed using an electronic balance with a maximum measuring range of 30 kg and an accuracy of 0 1 g the data collection system consisted of a wireless data receiver and a computer which could transmit and record data in real time in addition the actual application rate for each measuring position was observed outdoors using 21 5 cm diameter catch cans owing to differences in water distribution between d3000 and r3000 sprinklers the arrangement of catch cans varied between the two sprinkler types considering the uniform distribution of water along the circumference for the r3000 sprinkler three catch cans were arranged along the sprinkler s circumference near the canopy interception measuring area as shown in fig 1 b meanwhile the water collection by catch cans was conducted simultaneously with the canopy interception measurements however water from the d3000 sprinkler was divided into several discrete streams a single water stream can only cover an area of 0 20 to 0 3 m wide yan et al 2010 which results in no water being distributed on some parts of the 40 cm 40 cm interception measuring area thus two adjacent catch cans were arranged in the measuring area in order to avoid the overestimation of application rate by arranging one catch can under the water stream fig 1 c furthermore because the arrangement of catch cans coincided with the canopy interception measuring area application rates could only be measured after canopy interception experiments were concluded to avoid the impact of in canopy evaporation on canopy interception measurements experiments were conducted either before 8 30 or after 17 30 during the measurement period wind speed was no more than 0 5 m s 1 the average temperature was 22 3 c and the average reference evapotranspiration et o was only 0 06 mm h 1 especially after 17 30 the mean et o was only 0 014 mm h 1 in addition each measurement was 0 5 2 h in duration most of the longer duration tests were conducted after 17 30 and some 0 5 h experiments were conducted before 8 30 consequently the total et o was less than 0 03 mm during the experiment and the in canopy evaporation could be neglected all of the measurements were repeated three times alfalfa samples were prepared before each test initially the foam board was fully soaked in water in order to make the weight of board consistent before and after irrigation and to keep alfalfa plants fresh during the measurements next alfalfa plants were sampled from the field using scissors to cut all the plant material above 3 cm from ground level the sampling area was 30 cm 40 cm all of the sampled alfalfa plants were inserted immediately into the saturated foam board besides water should be sprayed around the foam board and not be sprayed on the plants before we measure the canopy interception then the foam board with alfalfa plants was promptly placed on an electronic balance which was connected to a computer through the wireless data receiver to observe the weight of the sample in real time subsequently the experimental irrigation was started and the initial weight of the foam board with alfalfa plants was recorded as w 0 before irrigation after the irrigation depth was increased by an increment of 1 mm the water supply was temporarily stopped for 1 min in order to eliminate the impact of the droplet kinetic energy and discharge the throughfall and stemflow and then the weight of alfalfa samples at irrigation depth i mm was recorded as wi for i 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 owing to the neglect of in canopy evaporation as well as the loss of the throughfall and stemflow changes in the weight of alfalfa samples consisted only of the weight of water intercepted by the alfalfa canopy the canopy interception was calculated using the following equation 1 i i Î´ w a Ï w w i w 0 30 40 10 here ii is the alfalfa canopy interception mm at irrigation depth i mm Î´w g is the change in weight of the alfalfa sample a cm2 is the sampling area of alfalfa i e 30 cm 40 cm 1200 cm2 Ï w g cm 3 is the water density i e 1 g cm 3 generally the canopy interception ii will tend to be stable and reach the maximum with the increase of irrigation depth the maximum value of canopy interception is recorded as im which is also considered as the canopy interception capacity to evaluate the variation in canopy interception for a given irrigation depth the proportion of canopy interception at irrigation depth i mm to the maximum canopy interception was defined as pi which is calculated as follows 2 p i i i i m 100 the interception ratio is calculated as follows 3 i r i i i i 100 here iri is the alfalfa canopy interception ratio at irrigation depth i mm 2 3 3 growth indices the plant height and leaf area index lai of alfalfa were measured after each experiment ten plants were selected randomly from the sampled alfalfa plants for measurement with a ruler lai was measured according to the principle of specific gravity after each measurement all sampled alfalfa plants were allowed to air dry in a cool place to evaporate the water from them within 1 2 h then the fresh weight of the total sampled alfalfa plants was recorded as m 1 subsequently ten plants were randomly selected and their stems and leaves were separated in order to calculate the stem to leaf ratio r thirty randomly selected leaves from ten plants were weighted to determine m 2 referred to below lastly thirty leaves were scanned to obtain the total leaf area of 30 leaves a 1 below using the image processing software adobe photoshop cc the total leaf area la cm2 of alfalfa can be calculated as follows 4 l a m 1 1 r a 1 m 2 the leaf area index can be calculated as follows 5 l a i l a a here la is the total leaf area cm2 and a is the sampling area of alfalfa cm2 2 4 statistical analysis the differences in alfalfa canopy interception capacity im under different growth stages and at different measurement positions were tested using one way analysis of variance anova assessed as significant at the p 0 05 level however the differences in im values under different application rates and droplet diameters were subjected to independent sample t tests again assessed as significant at the p 0 05 level the correlation between alfalfa canopy interception capacity and each variable plant height lai plant fresh weight etc was analyzed using pearson correlation in order to establish a model for predicting im and iri multiple regression analysis was applied with a stepwise regression model the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and normalized root mean square error nrmse between the predicted and observed values were used to test the goodness of fit of the regression models higher values of r 2 and lower values of rmse and nrmse correspond to higher accuracy of the model in predicting im and iri zheng et al 2018 the statistical data analyses and graphs were prepared with spss 20 0 analytical software ibm corp armonk ny usa and origin 8 1 software originlab northampton ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydraulic performance of sprinklers application rates and droplet diameter distributions differed dramatically between the r3000 and d3000 sprinklers fig 2 the indoor testing results demonstrated that the r3000 instantaneous application rate increased with distance until 2 5 m maximum of 23 8 mm h 1 from the sprinkler and then decreased gradually with the distance to the sprinkler 0 6 mm h 1 the d3000 instantaneous application rate remained constant and very low minimum of 0 4 mm h 1 until 6 m from the sprinkler and then rapidly increased until 7 5 m from the sprinkler to get the maximum around 312 6 mm h 1 and then sharply decreased again to the minimum 0 41 mm h 1 at 8 m remaining to approximately 10 m with constant and low values water sprayed by the d3000 sprinkler was mainly concentrated within between 5 5 m and 7 5 m from the sprinkler which was similar to the water distribution reported by yan et al 2010 consistent with results reported by faci et al 2001 and jiao et al 2017 water was distributed more uniformly along the radius for the r3000 sprinkler compared with the d3000 sprinkler the different characteristics of the r3000 and d3000 sprinklers in application rate could be explained by the divergent droplet size distributions of the two sprinklers as shown in fig 2 b the volume mean droplet diameters of both sprinklers increased with distance from the sprinkler meanwhile the volume mean droplet diameter of the r3000 was slightly higher than that of the d3000 between 1 and 5 m from the sprinkler and became similar to that of the d3000 at a range of 5 7 m from the sprinkler to better understand the droplet diameter distributions the percentage of droplets smaller than a given diameter was previously assessed and fitted with the following model li et al 1994 6 p v 100 1 exp a d d 50 n here pv represents the cumulative volume percentage of droplets less than a given diameter of d d represents an individual droplet diameter mm d50 represents the median droplet diameter which is droplet diameter corresponding to the pv of 50 mm and a and n represent regression parameters as shown in fig 2 c the d3000 sprinkler s range of droplet diameter variation was much smaller than that of the r3000 sprinkler in agreement with results reported by faci et al 2001 the pv values corresponding to droplet diameters of 2 mm and 3 5 mm for the d3000 sprinkler were 8 69 and 96 25 respectively this indicated that the volume of droplets with diameters of 2 3 5 mm which were mainly distributed across distances of 5 7 m from the sprinkler fig 2 b accounted for 87 56 of the total volume thus the application rate for the d3000 sprinkler was considerable in that narrow sector however the pv value corresponding to a droplet diameter of 2 mm for the r3000 sprinkler was 82 62 which indicated that most water was distributed at a distance within 5 m of the sprinkler when combined with the result illustrated in fig 2 b in addition the median droplet diameter and the volume mean droplet diameter for the r3000 sprinkler were 1 2 mm and 1 6 mm respectively both of which were smaller than the corresponding 2 86 mm and 2 96 mm values for the d3000 sprinkler in order to determine the actual irrigation depth during the canopy interception measurement the application rates for all selected positions were measured outdoors table 1 the d3000 7 m application rate measured outdoors was lower than that measured indoors fig 2 a which was partly due to some water evaporation outdoors on the other hand it demonstrated that application rate over the whole measuring area could be overestimated with only one catch can placed under the water stream in this study only outdoor application rates were used for analyses as shown in table 1 application rates were significantly different among the measuring positions except for r3000 3 m and d3000 6 m similarly a remarkable difference was found in the droplet diameters among the measuring positions except for r3000 7 m and d3000 7 m consequently the r3000 3 m and d3000 6 m measurements were chosen to assess the effect of droplet diameter on canopy interception and the r3000 7 m and d3000 7 m measurements were chosen to study the influence of application rate 3 2 dynamics of alfalfa canopy interception across irrigation depths the alfalfa canopy interception for the two sprinklers at the observed positions changed similarly with irrigation depth across the different growth stages fig 3 generally the alfalfa canopy interception had an initial rapid increase and then stabilized as irrigation depth increased which was consistent with the results of previous studies wang et al 2006 jiao et al 2016 in the rapid growth phase when the irrigation depth reached 2 mm pi values reached 75 66 81 00 as the irrigation depth continued to increase the alfalfa canopy reached saturation and maximum canopy interception im was obtained after irrigation depth exceeded 2 mm 3 mm and 4 mm at the s1 s2 and s3 stages respectively the irrigation depths of 2 mm 3 mm and 4 mm were the minimum irrigation depths for achieving the alfalfa canopy capacity at the s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively which have been suggested for foliar fertilization via a sprinkler systems in order to deliver more fertilizer that is essentially stored on the leaves water was more likely to be intercepted by the canopy in the initial period of irrigation probably owing to the discrete distribution of the small water droplets on the initially dry leaves and stems which was conductive to water retention as progressively more small droplets landed on the leaves or stems and accumulated into large droplets some water fell from the canopy leading to a reduction in the rate of increase of canopy interception to better quantify the dynamic process of alfalfa canopy interception a nonlinear regression analysis of alfalfa canopy interception ii and irrigation depth i was conducted the ii value may be zero at an irrigation depth of zero since irrigation has not occurred at an irrigation depth of zero as the irrigation depth approaches infinity however ii tends toward im based on the variation characteristics the following exponential model was developed 7 i i i m 1 e k i here ii represents the canopy interception at irrigation depth i mm and im is the maximum canopy interception mm this model was similar to the models presented by merriam 1960 and jiao et al 2016 fig 4 demonstrated that eq 7 fitted well with measurement data for all cases and the r 2 value of this model ranged from 0 615 to 0 976 furthermore the calculated im value was very similar to the measured maximum canopy interception with the relative error between 0 06 and 6 47 in this model coefficient k represents the variation in canopy interception according to eqs 2 and 7 pi can be calculated as follow 8 p i 1 e k i eq 8 indicated that pi increased with k thus for larger k values canopy interception capacity is more easily reached and im can be reached at lower irrigation depths meanwhile k was affected by the hydraulic performance of sprinklers and alfalfa growth stage jiao et al 2016 the average k value for the r3000 sprinkler 0 902 was 1 27 times larger than that for the d3000 sprinkler 0 713 this illustrated that water emitted by r3000 sprinklers was more prone to be intercepted by canopies than that by d3000 sprinklers that might be because the droplet diameter from r3000 sprinklers was smaller than that for d3000 sprinklers and the rate of wetting was greater for small volume droplets calder 1996 additionally the average k value of the alfalfa growth stages s1 s2 and s3 were 0 713 0 977 and 0 790 respectively thus the rate of increase for canopy interception at the s2 growth stage was largest a possible result of the canopy structure with large and sparse leaves however the exact relationship between k and the hydraulic performance of sprinklers or alfalfa growth stage could not be determined in this study 3 3 dynamics of canopy interception ratio across irrigation depths the interception ratio of alfalfa canopies decreased as irrigation depth increased across growth stages and measuring positions fig 4 which indicated that lower irrigation depths or smaller rainfall events contributed to a higher percentage of canopy interception as previously reported by zheng et al 2018 and zhang et al 2015 across all measurements the maximum interception ratio irm was reached at a minimum irrigation depth of 1 mm which increased with the growth stage of the alfalfa with irm values of 18 3 31 42 42 86 56 48 and 66 26 94 80 for the s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively this indicated that during the initial irrigation little water was intercepted by early vegetation stage canopies with low canopy coverage resulting in high stemflow and throughfall percentages conversely because the canopy coverage was nearly full at the bud stage little water passed through the canopy immediately and was intercepted by it across the different measuring positions the interception ratio at the r3000 3 m position was remarkably higher than that at other positions probably owing to the smallest droplet diameters being observed at this position furthermore according to eq 7 the interception ratio iri could be calculated using the following function model 9 i r i i m 1 e k i i 100 here i represents irrigation depth mm im represents canopy interception capacity mm and k is a coefficient for each alfalfa growth stage and measuring position assessed in this study the im and k values were known and the interception ratio for each irrigation depth was calculated using eq 9 the actual measured interception ratio across the different growth stages and measuring positions were used to validate the accuracy of the model comparisons revealed that this model agreed well with the measured results rmse 1 44 nrmse 4 96 and the average relative error was 2 66 accordingly interception ratio across different irrigation depths could be predicted using eq 9 for alfalfa under the experimental conditions of this study generally the irrigation depth applied for alfalfa ranged from 10 to 40 mm by the center pivot irrigation system in this study the interception ratio calculated with eq 9 across irrigation depths of 10 20 30 40 mm ranged from 2 2 8 9 and averaged 4 63 which was higher than the net interception loss averaged 2 9 of 21 1 mm reported by stambouli et al 2013 and similar to the gross interception loss averaged 7 2 of 10 mm reported by jiao et al 2016 however compared with the gross interception loss of corn averaged 21 6 of 23 08 mm reported previously by zheng et al 2018 the gross interception loss for alfalfa in the present study was much lower which might be owing to the low wettability of alfalfa leaf surface urrego pereira et al 2013 weiss 1988 3 4 canopy interception capacity of alfalfa at different growth stages canopy interception measurement was stopped when the irrigation depth reached 8 mm and the canopy interception capacity had been obtained under different measurement positions and sprinklers fig 3 consequently the canopy interception capacity and interception ratio at an irrigation depth of 8 mm were further analyzed as growth stage increased the canopy interception capacity and interception ratio of alfalfa significantly increased p 0 05 table 2 the im values were 0 46 mm 0 81 mm and 1 49 mm for the s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively the fresh weight of alfalfa plant height and lai also increased significantly with the growth stages p 0 05 table 2 the fresh weight and plant height were both the important indices to characterize the lai actually the increase in im as alfalfa grew can be mainly ascribed to the significant increase in lai overall the alfalfa canopy interception capacity range was in accordance with the results 0 29 1 26 mm of previous studies jiao et al 2016 which was much smaller than interception loss estimated in forests 0 31 5 14 mm for pine or shrubs 0 36 4 50 mm for caragana korshinskii or 0 75 5 29 mm for artemisia ordosica crockford and richardson 2000 zhang et al 2015 the canopy interception capacity of alfalfa was similar to that of winter wheat using the same weighing method 0 68 1 47 mm but was lower than that of corn 1 8 2 7 mm this variation in interception capacity between alfalfa and other plants might be owing to obvious differences in canopy characteristics the plant height of forest or shrubs was much higher than that of alfalfa which might increase water interception by stems kang et al 2005 the maize leaf surface corrugated waxy and covered with tomentum was more wettable water contact angles from 60 80 the alfalfa leaf surface relatively smooth and waxy was more hydrophobic water contact angles 120 urrego pereira et al 2013 weiss 1988 the higher leaf wettability and plant height of maize resulted in higher interception although the lai of alfalfa in this study was higher than that of maize zheng et al 2018 winter wheat a small densely planted crop has a canopy structure lai of 3 5 8 cm2 cm 2 plant height of 42 78 cm water contact angles 120 similar to that of alfalfa which appears to have resulted in similar canopy interception capacities kang et al 2005 netting and von 1973 in addition the interception ratio of alfalfa with the total irrigation depth around 8 mm was 5 27 9 15 and 17 59 for the s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively the interception ratio at stage of s3 was lower than that of forests 33 12 higher than that of shrubs 11 3 and similar to that of corn 17 1 at the gross precipitation or irrigation depth of 8 mm crockford and richardson 2000 carlyle moses 2004 zheng et al 2018 the difference in interception ratio among plants might be related to the dynamics of canopy interception across irrigation depths or cumulative precipitation levels for example the interception loss for shrubs was higher than that for alfalfa but the precipitation level needed to reach im was higher than that for alfalfa leading to the lower interception ratio observed for shrubs overall the canopy interception capacity of alfalfa at the bud growth stage is higher than that of the other two stages 3 5 effect of hydraulic performance of sprinklers on canopy interception capacity the alfalfa canopy interception capacity of different growth stages all decreased with the distance from sprinklers table 3 the largest im value for the d3000 sprinkler appeared 6 m from the sprinkler 0 45 mm 1 57 mm and that of r3000 appeared 3 m from the sprinkler 0 54 mm 1 61 mm however the im values at different measuring positions differed non significantly during the early vegetative stage p 0 05 but differed remarkably during the late vegetative stage and bud stage p 0 05 and the r3000 3 m im value was uniformly highest in order to determine the effects of application rate and droplet diameter on canopy interception capacity the im value for r3000 3 m r3000 7 m d3000 6 m and d3000 7 m were chosen for further analysis table 4 based on the comparison of the im values between r3000 7 m and d3000 7 m application rate had no significant influence on alfalfa canopy capacity p 0 05 this was in accordance with results reported by wang et al 2006 and kang et al 2005 but this contrasted with results from other studies jiao et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 the differences among the results might be attributed to the complex influence of application rate on canopy interception the kinetic energy intensity on leaf surface increased with the application rate which can result in the observed decrease in canopy interception however the increase of measuring duration as application rate decreased may provide more time for droplets to fall from the canopy which can also reduce canopy interception these conflicting tendencies lead to insignificant effects of application rate on canopy interception furthermore the comparison of im values between r3000 3 m and d3000 6 m showed that im decreased as droplet diameter increased but the difference was only significant at the s2 growth stage p 0 05 in agreement with results reported by kang et al 2005 meanwhile calder 1996 pointed out that the reduction in maximum canopy storage with increasing drop size can be attributed to drop kinetic energy thus droplet diameter appears to have been a main factor influencing the canopy interception capacity owing to hydraulic performance differences between d3000 and r3000 sprinklers the canopy capacity under the two types of sprinkler also differed as shown in table 3 the average im of the r3000 sprinkler was significantly greater than that of the d3000 sprinkler in the early vegetative and bud stages p 0 05 however no significant difference existed among the average im values of the two sprinklers at the late vegetative stage this might due to the significant decrease of im at r3000 7 m 0 62 mm which reduced the average im for r3000 sprinklers at the s2 stage table 3 the reduction of im at r3000 7 m was owing to the larger water droplet 2 79 mm on one hand on the other hand the lower application rate 5 16 mm h 1 at this position resulted in longer measuring duration 98 min due to the lower content of cellulose and lignin alfalfa stems were relatively weaker at the vegetative stage bozickovic et al 2014 kokubo et al 1991 the weaker stems and the higher plant height 0 47 m relative to the 0 11 m at early vegetative stage led to the slight bending of the upper part of alfalfa stems at late vegetative stage during the long time measurement this change of canopy structure also reduced the im to some extent actually the measured im at r3000 7 m for the s2 stage would be slightly lower than that of the original canopy structure however considering that the alfalfa lodging would also occur during long time irrigation in the real world and the measuring error of im due to the stem bending could be acceptable in fact there will be physiological wilting once alfalfa plants were cut however the alfalfa plants were immediately inserted into the saturated foam board and the wilting was unobservable generally there would be little difference between the measured canopy interception and that in the real world with the low speed wind and temperature wind speed less than 0 5 m s the average temperature of 22 3 overall the canopy interception capacity of alfalfa under the r3000 springer was larger than that under the d3000 sprinkler which might be owing to the smaller volume mean droplet diameter produced by the r3000 sprinkler in addition the results in the present study were obtained based on the assessment of the individual fixed sprinkler which might be slightly different from those under the moving sprinkler irrigation system in the real world therefore more subsequent research should be conducted with the actual center pivot irrigation systems using the two types of sprinklers 3 6 effect of alfalfa growth indices on canopy interception capacity the fresh weight lai and plant height of alfalfa had significant p 0 01 positive correlations with canopy interception capacity at different measuring positions table 5 in good agreement with results reported by wang et al 2006 zheng et al 2018 and kang et al 2005 this confirmed that alfalfa canopy interception capacity was closely related to canopy structure with alfalfa growth stage development plant height leaf area and fresh weight all increased resulting in more water being intercepted by larger leaves and higher stems overall the correlation coefficients describing the relationships of canopy interception capacity with fresh weight lai and plant height were 0 873 0 863 and 0 906 respectively portions of the measurement results were used for quadratic multiple regression analysis a stepwise regression model was also applied at the beginning of the regression analysis the total fresh weight plant height and lai were all considered to conduct the regression however the growth indices were related to each other and some of the variables were not independent after removal of the insignificant independent variables using a stepwise regression procedure the regression equation with only plant height was generated as shown in the following equation 10 i m 4 682 h 2 1 711 h 0 597 r 2 0 912 here im represents the alfalfa canopy capacity mm and h is the plant height m h 0 05 m plant height was the only main factor in the regression model resembling the result of the regression analysis between corn stemflow and other plant variables reported by lamm et al 2000 meanwhile plant height as a more readily available indicator was quite suitable for the prediction of the canopy interception capacity generally alfalfa stubble height was no less than 5 cm after each harvest monson 1966 sparrow and masiak 2008 therefore plant height applicable to the eq 10 should exceed 5 cm as shown in fig 5 the im value calculated using eq 10 agreed well with the measured data and the r 2 rmse and nrmse values were 0 912 0 09 mm and 9 10 respectively consequently the predicted model based only on plant height was relatively reliable and eq 10 is therefore recommended for predicting alfalfa im values 4 conclusions alfalfa canopy interception initially increased rapidly and then stabilized across irrigation depths irrigation depths of 2 mm 3 mm and 4 mm were the minimum irrigation depths for achieving alfalfa canopy capacity im at s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively both alfalfa canopy interception capacity and interception ratio significantly increased as growth stage developed p 0 05 the im values were 0 46 mm 0 81 mm and 1 49 mm for s1 s2 and s3 growth stages respectively at an irrigation depth of about 8 mm the interception rates of alfalfa were 5 27 9 15 and 17 59 for the three growth stages respectively application rate had no significant effect on the im p 0 05 while im decreased as droplet diameter increased overall the im of alfalfa was reached more quickly when the r3000 sprinkler was used and im was smaller for the d3000 sprinkler however the results were conducted with single sprinkler under the static conditions and more research should be carried out under the moving sprinkler irrigation system to verify it fresh weight plant height and lai had significantly p 0 01 positive correlations with canopy interception capacity the models for the dynamics of alfalfa canopy interception and interception ratio across irrigation depths were developed and fitted well with the actual empirical results accordingly a reliable model that included only the primary factor of plant height was also demonstrated to predict canopy interception capacity well because the canopy interception capacity has important influence on the water use efficiency and the foliar fertilization application effects the quantitative analysis of the alfalfa canopy interception under different low pressure sprinklers in this study can provide valuable and basic information for irrigation schedules and fertigation in alfalfa

10754,australia s sophisticated and advanced water market legislation has allowed direct investment by non landholder stakeholders in water ownership which over time has increased the volume of water entitlements owned by government non governmental organisations and non landholder investors e g superannuation companies trade speculators the growing market value of australian water entitlements driven by increased water scarcity and international commodity prices has meant that water is now one of the most valuable assets owned by many irrigators however to date there is no standard practise of financial water valuation and accounting nor is there an understanding of the most common methods used by various stakeholders we report information from 63 in depth expert interviews with bankers environmental water holders financial investors agri corporates property evaluators and water brokers in the murray darling basin to establish the current practices employed the most common valuation methods used current market prices based on water register and water broker data water entitlements were valued with historical cost or fair value water accounting depending on the stakeholder however

market development in the mdb is now very advanced fig 1 illustrates water entitlement and allocation trade over time in the southern mdb smdb and high reliability entitlement and allocation prices in victoria s 1a goulburn one of the most active water trading regions in the southern mdb combined with the removal of barriers to ownership e g 10 limit on entitlement ownership not tied to land in victoria accc 2010 non landholder ownership e g superannuation companies trade speculators and arbitragers ngos of water entitlements in the mdb has been growing this has been shown by delwp 2019a as increasing ownership of entitlements held by the non user group estimated at around 12 in northern victoria water also attracts international investment with 9 4 of mdb water entitlements held by companies with a level 2 2 the ato 2019 defines companies with a level of foreign ownership as 1 owned by an individual not ordinarily a resident of australia 2 owned by a foreign government or government investor 3 a company or trust where an individual not ordinarily resident in australia a foreign corporation or government holds a substantial interest of at least 20 or 4 a company or trust where two or more foreign persons hold an aggregate substantial interest of at least 40 of foreign ownership ato 2019 however without publicly available non landholder ownership data seidl et al 2019 and with a significant proportion of entitlements in the non user group held by irrigators i e in self managed superannuation accounts discerning the volume of entitlements owned by non landholders is challenging the importance of the value of water entitlements to irrigators can be illustrated with an example an average sized victorian irrigation farm with average water entitlement ownership in 2015 16 held land and water assets worth about aud 2 285 000 with water entitlements representing around 41 of the combined land and water value 3 3 average farm land value aud 1 360 000 and average water holding 370 ml of high security and 160 ml of low security was based on centre for global food and resources 2015 16 survey data for a victorian farm see wheeler et al 2018 for detail on survey water value aud 925 000 was based on revenue of selling entitlements before costs and fees at 2015 16 median entitlement prices for zone 1a goulburn delwp 2019b the same water portfolio would be worth aud 1 315 000 under 2018 19 prices almost the same as their land value the importance of water and its financial value combined with the emergence of non landholder water entitlement owners such as financial investors or ewhs has led to the following issues 1 how irrigators can borrow against their water entitlements and the credit for corporates versus family farms 4 4 family farms are said to be disadvantaged in comparison to corporate actors when borrowing against their water entitlements waterfind 2019 australian property institute 2016 2 how there is different access to information for various irrigators 5 5 loch et al 2018 found irrigators on average spent 5 2 hours per transaction searching for trade opportunities intuitively smaller non corporate farms have less time available disadvantaging them when water trading and 3 how water assets are valued by different stakeholders the lack of standard practice and consistency in valuing water can have many financial and political ramifications in conjunction with this reform in water property rights there has been a large scale effort to achieve environmental sustainability in the basin to deal with issues such as water scarcity drought water over allocation and severe environmental degradation the water act 2007 cwlth and the mdb plan 2012 basin plan aimed to return 2750 gl of water from consumptive to environmental use by mid 2019 the existence of water markets and the unbundling of water from land allowed the australian federal government commonwealth to purchase water entitlements from willing sellers as a result the commonwealth now owns a large amount of environmental water entitlements grafton and wheeler 2018 estimated at around 20 at mid 2019 there are three main ways the commonwealth has acquired water entitlements for the environment under the basin plan 1 through open reverse auction tenders buying water entitlements directly off willing sellers in various regions from 2007 08 to 2012 13 2 through subsidising upgrades of irrigation and supply infrastructure both on and off farm from 2008 onwards and 3 through closed tenders strategic purchases buying water entitlements and occasionally land from large sellers mainly from 2013 14 onwards grafton and wheeler 2018 the commonwealth states that strategic purchases target water entitlements with substantial ecological or hydrological importance for the mdb that are difficult to acquire with buybacks or infrastructure upgrades dawr 2018 however many strategic purchases have been heavily criticised for being inefficient and costly with little environmental water received for the dollars spent productivity commission 2018 slattery and campbell 2019 the senate 2018 for example water recovered through one such strategic purchase from a queensland property in 2017 kia ora has come under public scrutiny receiving significant media attention regarding the fair value of the recovered entitlements e g davies 2019 as non landholder water investment is increasing and with strong public interest in commonwealth water investment activities the methods used to assess and report water value are therefore highly relevant while improvements in physical water accounting was a key requirement under the national water initiative nwi coag 2004 there has been very little work done to date on ensuring consistency in how different stakeholders assess and account for financial water value in practice tingey holyoak 2019 indeed there is a lack of understanding about what water market valuation practices are actually used by organisations such as banks brokers governments non governmental organisations superannuation companies and large corporates water accounting and valuation is especially relevant as governments around the globe spend considerable resources to improve irrigation efficiency with the aim of reducing water consumption with the need to demonstrate value for money on the expenditure however without comprehensive physical water accounting increased irrigation efficiency can actually lead to more water consumption grafton et al 2018 whereas flawed financial water accounting can lead to overpayments for water licences and budget blowouts with australia at the forefront of both water commodification through water markets and extensive resources spent on water recovery through irrigation infrastructure efficiencies grafton and wheeler 2018 learnings from australian water accounting and valuation practices have valuable insights for the approaches in other countries this study identifies the valuation methods and accounting practices used for mdb water entitlements drawing on 63 in depth interviews with bankers environmental water holders investors property evaluators and water brokers in particular it seeks to address the following research questions 1 what accounting practices and valuation methods are used by different mdb stakeholders and 2 how does the employment of various valuation methods significantly impact water entitlement actual values we provide lessons for water accounting and water entitlement valuation in the mdb the lessons learned from the mdb can provide key insights for water accounting and water valuation in other countries 2 water accounting and valuation principles literature this background literature section is structured in three parts 1 a review of international water accounting systems and frameworks 2 a discussion of water financial valuation methods and 3 an overview of the current practice of water valuation and accounting in australia 2 1 international water accounting systems water accounting systems or frameworks report water related data for a number of different purposes and areas there are a variety of water accounting frameworks used globally all differing in purpose and scope godfrey and chalmers 2012 the majority focus on physical water accounting the reporting of volumes and quality of water on different scales each framework has a particular purpose for example the system of environmental economic accounting for water and the international water management institute water accounting framework report on water flows water stocks water use and consumption and water quality on the basin scale karimi et al 2012 vardon et al 2012 on the company or product level water footprint accounting shows the water volume necessary to manufacture a unit of product and water management accounting aims to increase businesses water management by illustrating water use and associated costs in production and supply chains christ and burritt 2017a hoekstra 2012 a common trait of water accounting frameworks is their limited capacity to incorporate financial monetary water data the system of environmental economic accounting for water attempts to include monetary flows that correspond to water flows by linking into a country s system of national accounts mainly for delivery and treatment cost and by having dedicated water valuation accounts however due to data limitations water valuation accounts remain experimental and unimplemented vardon et al 2012 the international water management institute water accounting framework attempts to capture water value by relating water use to agricultural output yet this is of minor consideration in the framework and seldom implemented godfrey and chalmers 2012 additionally in this framework water is only valuable as a function of agriculture ignoring the potential value to non agricultural water users karimi et al 2012 water value in water management accounting is highly dependent on the costs of water supply and wastewater treatment these are determined by water utilities tariffs often set low for political reasons in many countries mungatana and hassan 2012 limiting the benefit of financial water management accounting and its implementation water accounting frameworks describe what data ought to be reported but rarely provide guidance on how this data should be measured and compiled this is particularly true for data concerning monetary financial valuation of water assets 2 2 financial valuation for water assets in the absence of international agreement on how to value water resources the system of environmental economic accounting for water suggests water valuation methods commonly applied in economics e g residual methods revealed and stated preferences production functions should act as the default approach alternatively asset valuation methods from finance and accounting could also be used economic tools based on the concept of total economic value can be applied to the valuation of water resources based on their direct indirect and non use value united nations 2012 as the aforementioned water accounting frameworks focus mostly on direct water use water as an investment asset receives no mention and therefore no corresponding water valuation technique is discussed however a mainstay of finance and accounting is the valuation and reporting of asset value therefore financial asset valuation techniques could be applied for water rights financial asset valuation follows three approaches 1 discounted cash flows e g ascertains value based on an asset s fundamentals such as associated cash flows expected growth of the asset associated risk to cash flows and the asset s terminal value 2 value of comparable assets relative valuation price of comparable assets in the market place adjusting for difference in asset characteristics or cost of replacing the asset and 3 option pricing models contingent claim valuation dependent upon the occurrence of a particular event damodaran 2012b 2012c in contrast to financial valuation accounting determines the value of an asset as the historical cost of the asset less its accumulated depreciation or fair value if historical cost accounting is used this can result in significantly different book and market values for an asset especially for assets such as water which can move in value very quickly damodaran 2012a if fair value is used water market prices need to be readily available hence although possible financial water valuation and financial water accounting in the absence of readily available water market prices is difficult 2 3 water accounting and valuation in australia although australia has employed continuous water accounting since 1983 connell 2007 water accounts were primarily used for internal agency management purposes from 2004 the national water initiative coag 2004 required a water accounting framework to be developed which provides information for internal and external stakeholders to facilitate planning monitoring trading and environmental and farm management this led to the australian water accounting standards for general purpose water accounting gpwa currently used at the basin scale around australia including in the mdb water accounting standards board 2012a gpwa employs water accounts to report physical levels of water assets water liabilities net water assets changes in water assets and changes in water liabilities with application mainly on the catchment basin country scale although the framework was intended to be used also by companies businesses water accounting standards board 2012b on the basin catchment scale these water accounts underpin water sharing plans and water market activity in the mdb providing transparent information on how much water is managed how much is extracted and how much is traded chalmers et al 2012 the implementation of gpwa remains challenging the definition of relevant water assets is not standardised and often left to practitioners leading to inconsistencies between regions another significant methodological challenge is poor quality and lack of hydrological data tello and hazelton 2018 due to this lack of data gpwa assumes water extraction equals consumption this approach ignores return flows back to the river and hence has the potential to overestimate consumption and underestimate negative externalities which has been widely canvassed in the international literature grafton et al 2018 perry et al 2017 reflecting global practice gpwa also focuses on physical water accounting and does not incorporate economic financial data 6 6 the framework theoretically allows for monetary values to be used if appropriate for users information needs this is not implemented in practice godfrey and chalmers 2012 while basin level physical water accounting has dramatically improved with gpwa monetary water accounting is still underdeveloped the only monetary data readily available is water market data either an abridged version of the trade in state water registers and the bureau of meteorology water dashboard or analysed in report form abares 2018 however reviews have highlighted a number of issues with water register data deloitte 2019 mdba 2019b first there is no mandatory price reporting leading to a large number of trades without price or with a price of zero second entitlement transactions as a part of a land transaction are not always identified potentially skewing reported prices and this is a particular problem in the queensland water register third even if reporting errors have been identified they are either not corrected or a correct transaction gets inserted into the data without removing the erroneous transaction record mdba 2019b additionally and in contrast to land registers water ownership registers are not accessible publicly individual water licence information is often behind a pay per record paywall making it difficult to discern the size and value of various water holdings this is complicated by the fact that authorities often require stakeholders permission to share water licence information even in case of paid requests at the individual business level water accounting is voluntary and not standardised christ 2014 tingey holyoak 2019 for financial reporting the australian accounting standards board aasb recommends treating unbundled water rights as intangible assets with an indefinite lifespan water rights get valued at initial cost or purchase price less impairment contingent upon an active market a fair value assessment is undertaken at revaluation aasb 1995 2019b 2019c the aasb 2019a recommends three techniques for fair valuation 1 market namely relative valuation 2 replacement cost amount required to replace the asset and 3 income discounted cash flow however it does not provide a detailed valuation method for water entitlements nor does it recommend any of the fair valuation techniques there is also no industry recommended water valuation method although the australian property institute 2017 touches on water valuation in its guidelines for rural and agribusiness property valuation and runs water evaluator courses it only advises evaluators to understand water trade and budget issues similarly how to value water entitlements is only sparsely addressed in legislation if at all the water act 2007 cwlth mentions the market value of entitlements and that methods to establish this value are subject to regulations these regulations seem not to exist on the commonwealth level on the state level there is a similar but nuanced picture prior to unbundling water entitlements were valued as part of the land and governed by the relevant acts in every basin state and the australian capital territory act rates act 2004 act valuation of land act 1916 nsw land valuation bill 2010 qld valuation of land act 1971 sa valuation of land act 1960 vic since unbundling no state in the mdb has passed a legislative instrument dedicated to financial water valuation while some states refer to land valuation in their water legislation others make no mention of the issue nsw excludes water entitlements as part of land valuation but prescribes no methods for valuation in the water management act 2000 nsw the queensland water act 2000 qld mentions the market value of entitlements for compensation purposes but does not identify a corresponding valuation method it seems that the victorian water act 1989 vic addressed financial water valuation the most comprehensively requiring water entitlements to be valued by a certified valuer and exit fees in irrigation districts should represent the present value of all future fees payable but while the act prescribes discounted cash flow valuation for exit fees it provides no guidance on water entitlement valuation in contrast the act and sa have no provisions for water valuation in their legislation water resources act 2007 act natural resources management act 2004 sa for an overview of relevant water valuation legislation see appendix table a2 hence in the absence of dedicated guidelines in the mdb the choice of water valuation and financial water accounting practice lies with the evaluator and raises the research question of what methods are stakeholders applying and what are the potential consequences that arise from various valuation methods 3 data collection and analysis a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to explore a variety of water trade water ownership strategic risk management water valuation and accounting methods issues in the mdb this paper reports the findings from 64 semi structured interviews conducted with bankers evaluators ewhs investors and water brokers across the mdb given the fact that there are 1 no standard industry and legislative valuation methods 2 no publicly available register of water entitlement valuations and 3 the commercial in confidence practise of valuations we chose a qualitative method of data collection to understand these stakeholders water valuation strategies to specifically target large and prominent organisations with expert knowledge in water entitlement valuation water trading and agri business lending in the southern mdb such as banks evaluators and water brokers we used publicly available information to first identify relevant organisations and individuals within and as a second step a chain referral approach to recruit additional interview participants biernacki and waldorf 1981 consequently the qualitative interviews focussed on the views and valuation approaches of large and corporatised organisations given that the common approach to valuation employed both by government and industry is to contract large evaluation firms to undertake water entitlement valuations then our method of recruitment was aimed at understanding the methods by these firms the interviews were conducted mostly face to face in mid to late 2018 at times and locations convenient for respondents with 25 of interviews undertaken by phone and two respondents provided written submissions overall we approached 83 eligible individuals or organisations for interview and hence obtained a response rate of 77 recruitment continued until saturation was reached namely when no new information and themes were identified the incompleteness of one written submission meant it was excluded hence only 63 responses are included here interview recordings and transcripts were compiled into nvivo11 a qualitative data analysis software package and manually coded into major themes the interviews had a median length of 60 min and comprised three main stakeholder groups namely 1 15 ewh employees 2 27 water market investors financial investors and agri corporates and 3 21 bankers 6 water brokers 6 and water evaluators 10 7 7 note we interviewed a few respondents who worked for the same organisation this was because some ewhs and evaluators operate across multiple states with water management or valuation decisions made at the local level making it necessary to interview a variety of local representatives we grouped bankers water brokers and water evaluators together in the analysis as they do not own water and base their income on water related services rather than primary production ewhs are public or private entities owning or delivering water entitlements or allocations for environmental purposes investors own and or trade water to generate non commission income from water trading or revenues from growing crops the majority e g 20 of these were investors and agri corporates very large landholders owning and or trading water but generated their main income from farming while 7 were financial investors non landholders trading water for financial gain bankers represent financial institutions with significant portfolios in agribusiness and water entitlement lending water brokers generated commission based revenue from water market transactions evaluators are specialised in rural agribusiness and water valuations the socio economics were that 84 of our respondents were male with 70 of the female respondents working for ewhs and 75 of respondents have had experience in their current or a similar previous role for more than 10 years however our analysis suggested responses were mainly driven by the stakeholder group rather than by job experience or gender in addition this study applied a quantitative case study methodology to illustrate the monetary impact of using different water valuation methods the case study was the strategic water purchase by the commonwealth from kia ora a queensland property owned by eastern australian agriculture for the purpose of returning water from consumptive to environmental use we collected relevant water register data and used various water valuation methods to illustrate the differences in water values from different techniques applied 4 results and discussion the results are broken down into two main themes water valuation methods and water accounting methods over two thirds 68 of all participants discussed water valuation and water accounting in detail during the interviews with most comments respectively provided by bankers evaluators and water brokers investors and then ewhs 4 1 water valuation methods table 1 summarises the valuation methods and data sources considered by respondents 43 respondents commented on water valuation methods relative valuation methods based on current water market entitlement prices and transaction data were most commonly used other methods included adopting the broker price purchase price or using volume weighted average prices based on different lengths of data 6 18 months respondents explained that only transaction data between non distressed at arms length counterparties 8 8 there is no standard legal definition of non distressed counterparties rather evaluators apply an economic definition similar to the definition in land valuation bill 2010 qld meaning a transaction under reasonable terms without time pressure this is a core principle of commercial valuation is considered excluding transactions resulting from liquidation or bankruptcy 9 9 this stems from land valuation practices where transactions from liquidation are significantly discounted the nsw water register tracks water trades as a result of liquidation as 71x trades but they are unidentified in other state registers and 19 of respondents mentioned other valuation methods these alternative methods included 1 valuations based on historic and future allocation volume 2 associated production 3 long term average annual yield ltaay e g see cheesman and wheeler 2012 p 68 4 statistical and time series analysis and 5 capital asset pricing type valuation models in the stakeholder interviews respondents discussed in depth some water valuation challenges in particular comments were made in regards to thin water markets also called illiquid markets which refers to areas of trade with only a small number of market participants or very few trade transactions over multiple years tisdell 2011 the biggest challenge with thin markets was the absence of high quality data stakeholders addressed this gap by using water trade data from comparable water products in other regions based on reliability or property sales data for example evaluators consulted stock and station agents for the water value proportion of a property transaction we take out the value of the land structures apportion value to all those things and then work back to what an in situ value of water might be but it can be very difficult in those instances and people can have a wide variety of opinions as to what they think it might be worth evaluator only very rarely is a competing valuation undertaken by a different company to negotiate a valuation outcome or an entitlement valued at a discount to the market in an attempt to adjust for scarce or biased data there is a fair amount of discretionary space to choose data sources and methods for valuation but strong personal contacts in the real estate sector and to other evaluators are considered paramount to improve data availability on the other hand in a highly liquid water market respondents rate data quality and availability less of a concern for water valuation there are components of the water market that are still immature but largely across the southern connected system i think it s a very dynamic very well informed market evaluator however table 1 highlights there is still an element of discretion even for liquid markets particularly around data cleaning and data sources used another area of discretion is the time period all participants used entitlement trade data from the relevant state water registers but problems with data reported meant the need to clean data sets for example there are a large number of zero priced transactions representing either trades without a valid contract e g ewh trade or transfer or price not reported low and high outlier prices and data reporting lags of up to a few months de bonviller et al 2019 mdba 2019b it is common practice to exclude zero price trades from valuation or use median prices but adjustment for outlier values is less straight forward especially in less liquid markets abnormally high prices for water entitlements can appear for a number of reasons in nsw for example there is incentive to over value the water component of a bigger land transaction in order to minimise stamp duty fees given water s exempt status revenue nsw personal communication 11 11 2019 the act nsw queensland and sa water registers currently do not contain information on combined land water transactions allowing inflated water prices to enter unrecognised mdba 2019b water registers also do not contain information on whether an entitlement transaction included allocation or carry over volume deloitte 2019 these are called dry and wet water sales with wet sales containing allocation or carry over volume prices of wet entitlement sales are higher as a portion of the value is in the form of water allocations some respondents adjust their valuation by referring back to a dry entitlement price others implicitly assume that entitlements are wet dry at certain times of the year and this reflects in market prices i try and go back to a dry value if i can but obviously our evaluations are at a certain period of time we re taking it as at that date and if you re selling water that s got a bit of temporary water included then you re going to get a little bit of a premium evaluator the scale of a particular water entitlement transaction can also lead to outlier prices referred to as scalability by respondents the issue arises from water entitlements trading at a premium or discount corresponding to its transaction size some respondents argued that larger parcels of water trade for a premium with the buyer paying for the convenience and lower transaction costs of not having to aggregate the volume from smaller parcels 10 10 entitlement transactions require on average 13 2 hours per trade to finalize can include trading fees of on average aud 24 1064 transfer when crossing irrigation infrastructure operator boundaries and water broker commission of 1 5 or 3 0 of transaction value for sellers and buyers respectively loch et al 2018 a single large transaction can also incur a premium due to perceived less reputational risk and backlash in rural communities compared to many small transactions i think a continuing trend that s witnessed is that we typically see a premium of some sort for a larger parcel when compared to a smaller parcel evaluator on the other hand some respondents noted that smaller parcels of water trade at a premium because they are more affordable and attract a bigger pool of buyers smaller parcels have the higher premium someone has got 100 ml and they buy this 10 ml parcel for 4 100 ml all they ve done is made the average cost of their water go from 2200 ml to 2300 ml and the addition of throwing in 10 ml and they slowly accumulate on the basis of being able to afford it investor bankers evaluators and water brokers pointed to water broker data as an important source of information to mitigate shortcomings in the water registers particularly to address time lags while some respondents rely on a single broker many consult a number of water broker platforms in order to get a comprehensive market picture evaluators use property sales data sourced from real estate agents or the parties involved to identify the value apportioned to water in land water transactions some organisations also maintain internal databases on transactions or valuations undertaken our best evidence is what our clients are actually selling and buying i see every formal valuation that s done so we have a big database of what other valuers are putting on water banker respondents also discussed the time period used to value water entitlements while some include data from the last month only others consider up to the previous 18 months of data investors seem to prefer more recent data whereas bankers and ewhs use longer periods we tend to have a rolling benchmark so that looks back 18 months what the price has been doing another way in which we look at it we look at the last six to twelve months banker while most mdb water valuations use relative valuation methods in liquid markets discretion is exercised around what periods of data and what data sources to draw upon and around water value assumptions this often makes it difficult to compare different valuations as assumptions and methodology are often scarcely documented or commercial in confidence although some valuations contain explanatory footnotes these likely do not attract much attention as managers fixate on the valuation number as the main source of information briers et al 1997 while variations in valuations based on different approaches might be minor in liquid markets and where water values are not rapidly increasing it can have a substantial impact for thin markets as demonstrated in the following case study 4 1 1 case study strategic purchase of water from eastern australian agriculture the strategic purchase of water from eastern australian agriculture by the commonwealth department of agriculture and water resources dawr and now titled the department of agriculture as part of the basin plan to return water from consumptive to environmental use illustrates the impact of different valuation methods assumptions and evaluators discretion the dawr acquired 28 740 ml of overland flow water entitlements in the condamine balonne region from eastern australian agriculture s properties kia ora and clyde via a strategic purchase in august 2017 dawr 2018 for a definition of overland flow licences and their difference to unbundled water entitlements see the glossary in appendix table a1 the purchase included the condition that eastern australian agriculture must decommission levee banks and structures which allowed it to harvest the overland flows for the licences in question the publicly available documents state that this removal is done by the company at no cost the senate 2018 p 412 of the purchase value of aud 78 9 million aud 38 95 million was apportioned to 14 190 ml of unsupplemented condamine balonne water entitlements overland flow licences from kia ora while the purchase received initial attention in the senate in 2018 slattery and campbell 2018 the senate 2018 it attracted major public interest in the 2019 federal election campaign west 2019 wroe 2019 one key issue was whether the price paid by strategic purchase namely in negotiation with the company not on the open market was value for money for the type of water entitlements acquired davies 2019 given the relevant water valuation documentation was not publicly available dawr 2019 the senate 2018 grafton and williams 2019 have argued that the kia ora purchase in particular was an example of rent seeking behaviour by vested irrigation and corporate agriculture interests seeking to benefit from unduly high water entitlement valuations although government policy regarding strategic purchases is meant to give regard to socio economic impacts 11 11 the government has stated it prefers strategic water purchases over voluntary water buybacks as they are believed to have less socio economic consequences dawr 2018 part of a strategic purchase application is to demonstrate that the purchase has no or negligible socio economic impacts the senate 2018 pp 369 371 however socio economic impacts on a farm level are then used to justify a particular water price by evaluators based on the in production value of water and its impact on farm viability if the farm is less viable a higher price is seen as justified the senate 2018 p 389 dawr 2018 a government commissioned assessment by nceconomics deemed the kia ora water purchase to have negligible socio economic impacts for the region 12 12 the nceconomics assessment established that the strategic purchase 1 has a negligible impact on regional production and employment 2 would reduce eastern australian agriculture s land under irrigation by only 9 in higher flow years and less in normal years without adverse impacts on farm viability and 3 would constrain regional peak production higher flow years by 2 3 or 14 900 19 100 bales of cotton and 8 10 seasonal labour positions offset by alternative dryland cropping the senate 2018 the senate 2018 in 2017 an evaluator estimated a value for kia ora water entitlements based on 1 historic sales evidence 2 an estimation of the ltaay based on 1922 1995 data and 3 the difference in property value with and without water leading to a negotiated price of aud 2745 ml the government s competing valuation by nceconomics reduced the estimated ltaay of kia ora water from 14 190 ml to 12 983 ml based on 1985 2009 data leading to a 9 difference in purchase cost the senate 2018 to illustrate the impact of an evaluator s discretion and the implications for water prices we undertook a relative valuation of comparable water products such as unregulated water licences in the gwydir the barwon darling and the nsw intersecting streams and the more reliable 13 13 goulburn high security water yields a full allocation 95 years out of 100 with this allocation supported by storage infrastructure it also provides access to carry over a gwydir general security entitlement yields a full allocation 36 years out of 100 a kia ora unregulated overland flow licence 12 years out of 100 and are not supported by storage infrastructure this makes goulburn hs reg a more valuable entitlement cheesman and wheeler 2012 hargraves et al 2013 the senate 2018 water entitlement of regulated high security hs reg 1a goulburn in victoria for the given time period fig 2 it would have been within the evaluator s discretion to value the water at the median of condamine balonne or comparable overland flow licences as it was also in their discretion to choose 1922 1995 or 1985 2009 as the ltaay base given the lack of transparency and information regarding the purchase price of kia ora it is not possible to state why the value seemed higher than what could be expected however what can be verified is that if the commonwealth paid the median market price the purchase cost would have been around 42 97 less depending on the unregulated reference licence see table 2 while kia ora water could have traded at a premium due to its size 14 190 ml given government does prefer larger parcels to decrease its transaction costs per water transfer other aspects of its unregulated nature arguably do not warrant a price premium to the extent of making the water more expensive than the more reliable entitlement of goulburn high security 4 1 2 water valuation summary this study is limited by its focus on primarily qualitative data which hinder attempts at quantifying the impacts of different valuation methods future studies should analyse a dataset of real water valuations which was not available for this study 14 14 water entitlement valuations are often commercially in confidence and not publicly available if available valuation methodology and assumptions sections are usually redacted there is no register containing water valuations while a public central register for land and property valuations exists in some states it contains only the final value but not the actual valuation report however having access to the valuation report in particularly the valuation methods and assumptions sections is necessary to quantify the impact of evaluators discretion to quantify the monetary impacts of different assumptions and methods data cleaning and evaluators discretion on water entitlement valuations nevertheless our results provide a useful illustration of water valuation practices and their challenges while water valuation follows similar processes to the valuation of agricultural land i e market value of the asset at valuation date which may be due to continuation of the practice of irrigated land valuation prior to unbundling the assets are arguably very different water entitlements are more volatile than land and in many cases extremely liquid traded routinely in large volumes on active markets despite these differences a dedicated water valuation methodology has yet to emerge the current legislative and valuation industry s guidelines are fairly inconclusive on the treatment of water assets leaving much to evaluators discretion there is a lack of clearly defined methodologies and guidelines in the current practice of water valuation and accounting in the mdb confirming the findings of other studies christ and burritt 2017b tingey holyoak 2019 insights from the case study and respondents water valuation comments highlight how the valuation process can be sensitive to bias as it relies heavily on secondary data that is not always reported correctly nor transparent this is particularly pronounced in thin markets where data scarcity and quality arguably require the use of longer time periods and multiple data sources in addition commercial valuation relies on the notion of non distressed counterparties an interesting application of this involves government water recovery with environmental water recovery targets for each catchment and the corresponding deadline in form of the requirements of the basin plan public knowledge this condition is arguably violated hence the government could be seen as a distressed buyer under a strategic purchase regime particularly in thin markets with a high concentration of water entitlement ownership market power and a significant portion of the environmental water recovery still to recover various interests may be able to extract unduly high water entitlement prices due to government distress similarly evaluators method choices and assumptions could drive valuation outcomes and hence provides opportunities for rent seeking 4 2 water accounting systems the other major theme identified by our respondents was how water value was reported in accounting systems with distinct practices identified for banks ewhs and investors 4 2 1 accounting by banks water as collateral security bankers explained a mdb water entitlement can be accepted as a security for a loan or mortgage the value of this security is a function of the entitlements market value established by water valuation and a risk adjustment 15 15 banks adjust for the risk of the mortgagor defaulting the liquidity and collateral security bankers explained that standard lending risk metrics such as debt equity ratio historic income and cash flow are considered as well as the agribusiness banker s expertise and judgement about the farm enterprise otherwise known as an internal lending margin or extension rate some banks undertake water valuation in house others contract external valuation services due to conflict of interest larger or more complex valuations tend to be done externally whereas simpler valuation tasks stay in house most banker respondents conceded that experience with water as a security is limited and banks therefore employ a more conservative extension rate for water than for land in addition some banks reduce the valuation amount by 10 before applying the extension rate most also prefer to mortgage against a mix of water and land assets leading to a higher extension rate for water as part of an asset mix and to not lend against water entitlements alone it is known that water entitlements are less protected than land in legal terms first water entitlements are a statutory property right making them less protected from regulatory change than a land title fisher 2010 second banks can directly access the money from a land sale to satisfy their mortgage whereas such a provision does not exist in every state for water entitlement sales as the money can go straight to the seller 16 16 nsw qld and vic legislation rule that caveats can be placed on water entitlements entitlements can only be transferred if agreed by the mortgagee and in the case of default proceeds of water sales need to satisfy mortgages first water act 1989 vic water act 2000 qld water management act 2000 nsw in contrast sa legislation allows for caveats to be placed on water entitlements but does not provide mortgagees with veto powers nor does it dictate the use of proceeds from water sales in case of default natural resources management act 2004 sa there are cases where the water owner took the money defaulted on the mortgage and disappeared leaving it to the bank to chase the money through litigation although one third of the bankers interviewed accepted water entitlements as security by themselves they are subject to lower extension rates ranging between 50 70 representing a 10 20 discount as compared to agricultural land extension rates note that banks still negotiate the terms of the mortgage and extension rates only determine securities value if it s part of a wider transaction that involves farming land so dirt and water and water being used on the land then we ll lend up to 70 of the water value if it s a transaction where it s not being used specifically by the owner or a related party of the owner for farming purposes so it s more of a speculative investment type purchase then we reduce that to 50 banker once a mortgage has been negotiated banks do not adjust the value of the water asset until revaluation again revaluation periods depend on the bank they may for example be yearly every three years or only for intended re mortgage 4 2 2 accounting by ewh water as environmental asset ewh respondents account for the value of their water assets at historic cost less impairment aasb 2019b the relevant cost is heavily influenced by the way water was initially acquired purchase price if the water was bought on the market or the value apportioned to water recovered as part of a strategic purchase or infrastructure upgrade dawr 2018 for strategic purchases the water value relies heavily on external valuation for water entitlements acquired through infrastructure upgrades they can cost a premium of up to 7 1 times the market price once transaction program costs are taken into account productivity commission 2018 finally for water entitlements transferred from another entity for free e g gift of environmental water entitlements by the victorian government to the victorian environmental water holder vewh 2018 the cost is aud 0 ml 17 17 this is generally the case for ewhs when no cost purchase price or cost of infrastructure efficiency program can be attributed to a particular water entitlement e g bulk water entitlements outside of the mdb these costs remain unadjusted in ewh accounts save annual impairment testing until revaluation which only occurs in active markets however ewh respondents often argue that there is no active market for environmental water since it is never to be sold in practice this leads to environmental water assets being massively undervalued most water entitlements have appreciated considerably from the time the majority of ewhs acquired their portfolios and impairment adjustment cannot exceed the initial cost the practice of claiming no active market to avoid revaluation has likely evolved within public ewhs with the aim to avoid treasury calls for revenue from water assets although most public ewhs are not required to recover costs or create revenue but rather manage their water for environmental benefit o donnell 2013 2018 this is not the case for all and subject to regulatory change one respondent explained that as water entitlements are listed on a state s asset register they reported that the treasury argues that water assets are contributing to a state s bottom line and need to be valued at market value there is then perhaps an argument that they should therefore recover the associated costs of holding and using the asset licencing and trading fees requiring ewhs to create a monetary return through allocation sales however ewhs prefer to manage water for environmental benefits not cost recovery the model where government absorbs the costs in some other mechanism and the ewh just has to go about their business as managing the water is the preferred model ewh there are some ewhs that employ a market valuation approach for entitlements acquired through direct purchase although water recovered through infrastructure upgrades remains at cost this approach allows ewhs to represent water ownership value closer to the current market better informing water portfolio rebalancing decisions 4 2 3 accounting by financial investors and agri corporates all businesses list their water portfolio value in their balance sheets but the accounting framework differs for entitlements held for production or as part of an investment asset portfolio when water entitlements govern water held for production water entitlements are treated as intangible assets with an indefinite life span accounted for at historic cost less impairment with the purchase price as the historic cost aasb 2019b in contrast to ewhs investors agri corporates revalue their entitlements at fair market value however this often occurs infrequently for example family farms tend to account for entitlements at cost for multiple years without revaluing and only revalue if required by their bank while some investors revalue their water assets annually this was not standard process amongst our respondents non landholder financial investors hold water entitlements as part of a real asset investment portfolio they value water entitlements at current market prices and revalue at a high frequency sometimes every month making sure the market asset value is represented at all times this provides transparency and enables shareholders to make swift decisions about portfolio restructure we are an investment fund we have to hold water at its fair market value based on aasb13 fair value measurement in our books rather than historic cost that s important for us because our members can trade in and out of our product daily we need to have an up to date market valuation so that we can ensure they re trading in and out at fair market value financial investor historical cost accounting has implications for investors agri corporates having a significant part of their asset value not reflected in financial statements can make communication with shareholders difficult as well as not reflecting the true value of the company my previous employer had water that was at about a tenth of its value on the books that just suggests that the accounting standards are back to front investor by accounting for water at fair value aasb 2019a financial investors have stronger balance sheets which is advantageous when trying to attract investor interest and credit opportunities however one banker respondent claimed that the balance sheet value of water has no bearing on credit decisions financial institutions take no notice of the value in the balance sheet when it comes to property and that s why they do valuations on water and at the end of the day the bank manager and the customer know the true value of the asset banker one potential reason for this may be the difference between the market value of water as represented by comparative valuations versus the value of the water used by the business all businesses will have differing marginal values of water e g see wheeler et al 2014b estimates for differing buy and sell water trade values for various irrigation industries the true value the respondent refers to is likely the marginal value of water for a particular business which can be different to the book value 18 18 however due to accounting treatment under aasb138 intangible assets aasb 2019b book value is impaired when water prices fall below the initial purchase price therefore the current market value can only ever be equal or larger than the book value and different to the current market value 4 2 4 accounting framework summary financial water accounting practice in australia broadly follows historical cost or fair value accounting practices set out by the aasb aasb 2019a 2019b however as aasb standards only have to be used by reporting entities such as asx200 listed or companies with significant external stakeholders water accounting by smaller businesses is not impacted this leads to a wide variety of water values being reported without much transparency about assumptions or the accounting framework used this is exasperated by the sometimes poor quality of water entitlement ownership data misreporting the location and security of stakeholders water entitlement ownership consequently comparing different water asset portfolios is challenging at best historical cost accounting particularly has been criticised as obscuring real performance providing largely irrelevant information and leading to poorer business decision making argilÃ©s bosch et al 2012 barlev and haddad 2003 this resonates with the concern that smaller businesses are disadvantaged in accessing capital since an important part of their asset base namely water entitlements are often undervalued due to historical cost accounting and infrequent re evaluation given the maturity of southern mdb water markets fair value accounting for water assets is possibly more transparent more reflective of economic realities and arguably easier than historical cost accounting more transparent water accounting frameworks reflecting the current value of water provide important information for stakeholders and may enable better water management transparency in accounting can also build trust in the water market system wheeler et al 2017 the mdb case points to important aspects for water valuation and accounting globally current water accounting initiatives on the business scale are not standardized they focus mainly on physical water information and water use but do not pay attention to water asset values burritt and christ 2017 tingey holyoak 2019 future studies should pay more attention to financial water values and attempt to incorporate these values better into existing accounting frameworks with water increasingly becoming a sought after investment asset with increased non landholder ownernership plus being an important part of irrigators assets water accounting needs to adequately reflect the fair value of the asset rather than its historic cost or just the cost of provision and physical volumes while some basin scale water accounting frameworks envision financial water accounting conceptually they provide little instruction on best practice water valuation methods clear standards and methodologies for both accounting and valuation are necessary to enable transparent and comparable assessment of financial water asset value for diverse stakeholders to underpin the hydrological integrity and financial water asset values physical accounting considering net water consumption on a basin scale grafton et al 2018 and financial fair value accounting of water rights reflecting current market values are paramount transparent valuation of water resources should follow a standardised approach in regards to data cleaning data sources considered and valuation methods employed in addition governance regulation and corruption have been identified as important issues for water markets globally o donnell and garrick 2019 therefore when water valuations concern government expenditure we suggest that methods data and assumptions used should be publicly available rather than commercial in confidence to 1 increase accountability 2 demonstrate value for money 3 discourage rent seeking by vested interests and 4 engender trust in government processes grafton and williams 2019 wheeler et al 2017 furthermore in situations where the government is perhaps classified as a distressed buyer to recover water standard commercial valuation methodology might not be appropriate to discern the value of water rights 5 conclusion this study used qualitative information from 63 interviews with water experts banks evaluators ewhs investors and water brokers and case study quantitative information to highlight issues associated with 1 water entitlement valuation and 2 water accounting frameworks the majority of respondents used relative valuation namely current market value to value water entitlements as well as other methods such as purchase price and volume weighted average price bankers value water on a longer period of water market data 6 18 months whereas evaluators largely rely on information within the last six months water register and water broker data were the most commonly used data sources issues associated with valuation include transparency and accuracy of water market data larger versus smaller water parcels transaction costs and fees and wet versus dry trades these are particularly impactful in thin water markets where data availability and quality are poor we show that the use of different data and methods can have a meaningful impact on valuation values as demonstrated in the kia ora commonwealth s strategic purchase case study where the same water entitlement could have been valued anywhere between aud 95 2745 per ml and it is highly likely that the commonwealth paid considerably more up to 97 more than they should have due to evaluator discretion in the mdb physical water accounting is limited by its focus on gross extraction rather than net consumption of water financial water accounting frameworks value water at historical cost less impairment or fair value bankers stated they applied extension rates between 50 60 to water valuations whereas rates between 60 70 apply to agricultural land for mortgage and security purposes on the other hand financial investors owning water as part of a real asset investment portfolio revalue assets monthly at current market prices ewhs undertake yearly impairment testing but do not revalue their portfolio as they claim there is no active market for environmental water the difference in accounting can lead to a material divergence in reported water portfolio values between stakeholders making comparisons challenging the predominant use of historical cost accounting by small businesses could disadvantage them in regards to access to capital these findings highlight that there are no clear standards for water valuation and financial water accounting and we illustrated this impact on water asset values physical water accounting does not report real availability of water resources as it is based on an assessment of gross extractions there is a need for proper water accounting across the whole basin accounting for return flows and all water consumed the processes of financial water valuation and accounting are confusing and potentially obfuscating enabling rent seeking by various interests as illustrated by a series of inquiries a mdb royal commission and considerable public interest in government water valuation of strategic environmental water purchases there is a compelling need for transparent and open water management valuation and financial water accounting greater transparency and a standardised water valuation method clearly identifying assumptions made would reinforce the development of water markets both in the mdb and worldwide proper accounting practice is important to discharge organisations responsibilities for water management and purchase against its stakeholders contributing to greater trust in institutions and governance which is a vital issue for all water

10754,australia s sophisticated and advanced water market legislation has allowed direct investment by non landholder stakeholders in water ownership which over time has increased the volume of water entitlements owned by government non governmental organisations and non landholder investors e g superannuation companies trade speculators the growing market value of australian water entitlements driven by increased water scarcity and international commodity prices has meant that water is now one of the most valuable assets owned by many irrigators however to date there is no standard practise of financial water valuation and accounting nor is there an understanding of the most common methods used by various stakeholders we report information from 63 in depth expert interviews with bankers environmental water holders financial investors agri corporates property evaluators and water brokers in the murray darling basin to establish the current practices employed the most common valuation methods used current market prices based on water register and water broker data water entitlements were valued with historical cost or fair value water accounting depending on the stakeholder however given the lack of standardised methodology evaluator discretion and fast moving or thin markets can lead to considerable divergence in water valuation values recommendations are made for the need for greater transparency and standardised water valuation methods keywords water asset water rights water value water markets australia 1 introduction much of the world s agricultural systems and regions face a drier future with increased frequency of extreme events such as droughts ipcc 2019 this is especially true for australia s murray darling basin mdb a region already experiencing a highly variable climate much of south eastern australia has been experiencing drought from 2017 onwards leading to a rapid increase in permanent and temporary water prices albeit temporary prices have still not reached the heights of the millennium drought time period from 2001 02 to 2009 10 delwp 2019a the rapid rise of water prices means that sometimes water is one of the most valuable commodities owned by an irrigation farmer in the mdb water ownership has been separated from land allowing non landholders like financial investors and environmental water holders ewhs direct ownership of water rights via water markets grafton and horne 2014a with mdb water markets routinely recognized as the most advanced water markets globally grafton et al 2011 their challenges and best practice solutions are highly relevant for other water market systems world wide water markets have existed formally in the mdb since the 1980s but developed more rapidly since water entitlement otherwise known as rights ownership was separated from land from 2004 onwards coag 2004 the further unbundling of water rights in use and delivery rights nwc 2011b and the stepwise reduction in trade limits and barriers across the mdb accc 2010 although there now is a large variety of tradable water rights e g more than 150 different tradeable entitlements mdba 2019a trade concentrates in two main products 1 water entitlements permanent water a right to extract water from a watercourse body and 2 water allocations temporary water the seasonal allocation received by a given water entitlement from a watercourse body wheeler et al 2014a water entitlements come in three main forms high general and low security reflecting the probability of receiving a full water allocation for example a high security entitlement is meant to yield on average a full allocation in 90 95 out of 100 years zuo et al 2016 mdb water markets seek to allocate water to its highest and best use and have historically provided significant economic and drought adaptation benefits grafton and horne 2014b kirby et al 2015 yet a number of rights such as water use licences are still tied to land ownership and not fully unbundled similarly trading rural water for urban use is restricted although with some exceptions such as irrigation infrastructure organisations and water utilities purchasing water entitlements to support country towns or adelaide s water supply during the millennium drought nwc 2012 from 2007 onwards an organisation can buy water rights in the southern mdb 1 1 unbundling has been slower in the northern mdb with some systems entitlements still linked to land however greater institutional and regulatory reform is required before increased trade can occur without causing additional negative externalities on the market place without owning any land and achieve a return by selling water through the market to end users like irrigators nwc 2011b seidl et al 2019 wheeler et al 2016 water market development in the mdb is now very advanced fig 1 illustrates water entitlement and allocation trade over time in the southern mdb smdb and high reliability entitlement and allocation prices in victoria s 1a goulburn one of the most active water trading regions in the southern mdb combined with the removal of barriers to ownership e g 10 limit on entitlement ownership not tied to land in victoria accc 2010 non landholder ownership e g superannuation companies trade speculators and arbitragers ngos of water entitlements in the mdb has been growing this has been shown by delwp 2019a as increasing ownership of entitlements held by the non user group estimated at around 12 in northern victoria water also attracts international investment with 9 4 of mdb water entitlements held by companies with a level 2 2 the ato 2019 defines companies with a level of foreign ownership as 1 owned by an individual not ordinarily a resident of australia 2 owned by a foreign government or government investor 3 a company or trust where an individual not ordinarily resident in australia a foreign corporation or government holds a substantial interest of at least 20 or 4 a company or trust where two or more foreign persons hold an aggregate substantial interest of at least 40 of foreign ownership ato 2019 however without publicly available non landholder ownership data seidl et al 2019 and with a significant proportion of entitlements in the non user group held by irrigators i e in self managed superannuation accounts discerning the volume of entitlements owned by non landholders is challenging the importance of the value of water entitlements to irrigators can be illustrated with an example an average sized victorian irrigation farm with average water entitlement ownership in 2015 16 held land and water assets worth about aud 2 285 000 with water entitlements representing around 41 of the combined land and water value 3 3 average farm land value aud 1 360 000 and average water holding 370 ml of high security and 160 ml of low security was based on centre for global food and resources 2015 16 survey data for a victorian farm see wheeler et al 2018 for detail on survey water value aud 925 000 was based on revenue of selling entitlements before costs and fees at 2015 16 median entitlement prices for zone 1a goulburn delwp 2019b the same water portfolio would be worth aud 1 315 000 under 2018 19 prices almost the same as their land value the importance of water and its financial value combined with the emergence of non landholder water entitlement owners such as financial investors or ewhs has led to the following issues 1 how irrigators can borrow against their water entitlements and the credit for corporates versus family farms 4 4 family farms are said to be disadvantaged in comparison to corporate actors when borrowing against their water entitlements waterfind 2019 australian property institute 2016 2 how there is different access to information for various irrigators 5 5 loch et al 2018 found irrigators on average spent 5 2 hours per transaction searching for trade opportunities intuitively smaller non corporate farms have less time available disadvantaging them when water trading and 3 how water assets are valued by different stakeholders the lack of standard practice and consistency in valuing water can have many financial and political ramifications in conjunction with this reform in water property rights there has been a large scale effort to achieve environmental sustainability in the basin to deal with issues such as water scarcity drought water over allocation and severe environmental degradation the water act 2007 cwlth and the mdb plan 2012 basin plan aimed to return 2750 gl of water from consumptive to environmental use by mid 2019 the existence of water markets and the unbundling of water from land allowed the australian federal government commonwealth to purchase water entitlements from willing sellers as a result the commonwealth now owns a large amount of environmental water entitlements grafton and wheeler 2018 estimated at around 20 at mid 2019 there are three main ways the commonwealth has acquired water entitlements for the environment under the basin plan 1 through open reverse auction tenders buying water entitlements directly off willing sellers in various regions from 2007 08 to 2012 13 2 through subsidising upgrades of irrigation and supply infrastructure both on and off farm from 2008 onwards and 3 through closed tenders strategic purchases buying water entitlements and occasionally land from large sellers mainly from 2013 14 onwards grafton and wheeler 2018 the commonwealth states that strategic purchases target water entitlements with substantial ecological or hydrological importance for the mdb that are difficult to acquire with buybacks or infrastructure upgrades dawr 2018 however many strategic purchases have been heavily criticised for being inefficient and costly with little environmental water received for the dollars spent productivity commission 2018 slattery and campbell 2019 the senate 2018 for example water recovered through one such strategic purchase from a queensland property in 2017 kia ora has come under public scrutiny receiving significant media attention regarding the fair value of the recovered entitlements e g davies 2019 as non landholder water investment is increasing and with strong public interest in commonwealth water investment activities the methods used to assess and report water value are therefore highly relevant while improvements in physical water accounting was a key requirement under the national water initiative nwi coag 2004 there has been very little work done to date on ensuring consistency in how different stakeholders assess and account for financial water value in practice tingey holyoak 2019 indeed there is a lack of understanding about what water market valuation practices are actually used by organisations such as banks brokers governments non governmental organisations superannuation companies and large corporates water accounting and valuation is especially relevant as governments around the globe spend considerable resources to improve irrigation efficiency with the aim of reducing water consumption with the need to demonstrate value for money on the expenditure however without comprehensive physical water accounting increased irrigation efficiency can actually lead to more water consumption grafton et al 2018 whereas flawed financial water accounting can lead to overpayments for water licences and budget blowouts with australia at the forefront of both water commodification through water markets and extensive resources spent on water recovery through irrigation infrastructure efficiencies grafton and wheeler 2018 learnings from australian water accounting and valuation practices have valuable insights for the approaches in other countries this study identifies the valuation methods and accounting practices used for mdb water entitlements drawing on 63 in depth interviews with bankers environmental water holders investors property evaluators and water brokers in particular it seeks to address the following research questions 1 what accounting practices and valuation methods are used by different mdb stakeholders and 2 how does the employment of various valuation methods significantly impact water entitlement actual values we provide lessons for water accounting and water entitlement valuation in the mdb the lessons learned from the mdb can provide key insights for water accounting and water valuation in other countries 2 water accounting and valuation principles literature this background literature section is structured in three parts 1 a review of international water accounting systems and frameworks 2 a discussion of water financial valuation methods and 3 an overview of the current practice of water valuation and accounting in australia 2 1 international water accounting systems water accounting systems or frameworks report water related data for a number of different purposes and areas there are a variety of water accounting frameworks used globally all differing in purpose and scope godfrey and chalmers 2012 the majority focus on physical water accounting the reporting of volumes and quality of water on different scales each framework has a particular purpose for example the system of environmental economic accounting for water and the international water management institute water accounting framework report on water flows water stocks water use and consumption and water quality on the basin scale karimi et al 2012 vardon et al 2012 on the company or product level water footprint accounting shows the water volume necessary to manufacture a unit of product and water management accounting aims to increase businesses water management by illustrating water use and associated costs in production and supply chains christ and burritt 2017a hoekstra 2012 a common trait of water accounting frameworks is their limited capacity to incorporate financial monetary water data the system of environmental economic accounting for water attempts to include monetary flows that correspond to water flows by linking into a country s system of national accounts mainly for delivery and treatment cost and by having dedicated water valuation accounts however due to data limitations water valuation accounts remain experimental and unimplemented vardon et al 2012 the international water management institute water accounting framework attempts to capture water value by relating water use to agricultural output yet this is of minor consideration in the framework and seldom implemented godfrey and chalmers 2012 additionally in this framework water is only valuable as a function of agriculture ignoring the potential value to non agricultural water users karimi et al 2012 water value in water management accounting is highly dependent on the costs of water supply and wastewater treatment these are determined by water utilities tariffs often set low for political reasons in many countries mungatana and hassan 2012 limiting the benefit of financial water management accounting and its implementation water accounting frameworks describe what data ought to be reported but rarely provide guidance on how this data should be measured and compiled this is particularly true for data concerning monetary financial valuation of water assets 2 2 financial valuation for water assets in the absence of international agreement on how to value water resources the system of environmental economic accounting for water suggests water valuation methods commonly applied in economics e g residual methods revealed and stated preferences production functions should act as the default approach alternatively asset valuation methods from finance and accounting could also be used economic tools based on the concept of total economic value can be applied to the valuation of water resources based on their direct indirect and non use value united nations 2012 as the aforementioned water accounting frameworks focus mostly on direct water use water as an investment asset receives no mention and therefore no corresponding water valuation technique is discussed however a mainstay of finance and accounting is the valuation and reporting of asset value therefore financial asset valuation techniques could be applied for water rights financial asset valuation follows three approaches 1 discounted cash flows e g ascertains value based on an asset s fundamentals such as associated cash flows expected growth of the asset associated risk to cash flows and the asset s terminal value 2 value of comparable assets relative valuation price of comparable assets in the market place adjusting for difference in asset characteristics or cost of replacing the asset and 3 option pricing models contingent claim valuation dependent upon the occurrence of a particular event damodaran 2012b 2012c in contrast to financial valuation accounting determines the value of an asset as the historical cost of the asset less its accumulated depreciation or fair value if historical cost accounting is used this can result in significantly different book and market values for an asset especially for assets such as water which can move in value very quickly damodaran 2012a if fair value is used water market prices need to be readily available hence although possible financial water valuation and financial water accounting in the absence of readily available water market prices is difficult 2 3 water accounting and valuation in australia although australia has employed continuous water accounting since 1983 connell 2007 water accounts were primarily used for internal agency management purposes from 2004 the national water initiative coag 2004 required a water accounting framework to be developed which provides information for internal and external stakeholders to facilitate planning monitoring trading and environmental and farm management this led to the australian water accounting standards for general purpose water accounting gpwa currently used at the basin scale around australia including in the mdb water accounting standards board 2012a gpwa employs water accounts to report physical levels of water assets water liabilities net water assets changes in water assets and changes in water liabilities with application mainly on the catchment basin country scale although the framework was intended to be used also by companies businesses water accounting standards board 2012b on the basin catchment scale these water accounts underpin water sharing plans and water market activity in the mdb providing transparent information on how much water is managed how much is extracted and how much is traded chalmers et al 2012 the implementation of gpwa remains challenging the definition of relevant water assets is not standardised and often left to practitioners leading to inconsistencies between regions another significant methodological challenge is poor quality and lack of hydrological data tello and hazelton 2018 due to this lack of data gpwa assumes water extraction equals consumption this approach ignores return flows back to the river and hence has the potential to overestimate consumption and underestimate negative externalities which has been widely canvassed in the international literature grafton et al 2018 perry et al 2017 reflecting global practice gpwa also focuses on physical water accounting and does not incorporate economic financial data 6 6 the framework theoretically allows for monetary values to be used if appropriate for users information needs this is not implemented in practice godfrey and chalmers 2012 while basin level physical water accounting has dramatically improved with gpwa monetary water accounting is still underdeveloped the only monetary data readily available is water market data either an abridged version of the trade in state water registers and the bureau of meteorology water dashboard or analysed in report form abares 2018 however reviews have highlighted a number of issues with water register data deloitte 2019 mdba 2019b first there is no mandatory price reporting leading to a large number of trades without price or with a price of zero second entitlement transactions as a part of a land transaction are not always identified potentially skewing reported prices and this is a particular problem in the queensland water register third even if reporting errors have been identified they are either not corrected or a correct transaction gets inserted into the data without removing the erroneous transaction record mdba 2019b additionally and in contrast to land registers water ownership registers are not accessible publicly individual water licence information is often behind a pay per record paywall making it difficult to discern the size and value of various water holdings this is complicated by the fact that authorities often require stakeholders permission to share water licence information even in case of paid requests at the individual business level water accounting is voluntary and not standardised christ 2014 tingey holyoak 2019 for financial reporting the australian accounting standards board aasb recommends treating unbundled water rights as intangible assets with an indefinite lifespan water rights get valued at initial cost or purchase price less impairment contingent upon an active market a fair value assessment is undertaken at revaluation aasb 1995 2019b 2019c the aasb 2019a recommends three techniques for fair valuation 1 market namely relative valuation 2 replacement cost amount required to replace the asset and 3 income discounted cash flow however it does not provide a detailed valuation method for water entitlements nor does it recommend any of the fair valuation techniques there is also no industry recommended water valuation method although the australian property institute 2017 touches on water valuation in its guidelines for rural and agribusiness property valuation and runs water evaluator courses it only advises evaluators to understand water trade and budget issues similarly how to value water entitlements is only sparsely addressed in legislation if at all the water act 2007 cwlth mentions the market value of entitlements and that methods to establish this value are subject to regulations these regulations seem not to exist on the commonwealth level on the state level there is a similar but nuanced picture prior to unbundling water entitlements were valued as part of the land and governed by the relevant acts in every basin state and the australian capital territory act rates act 2004 act valuation of land act 1916 nsw land valuation bill 2010 qld valuation of land act 1971 sa valuation of land act 1960 vic since unbundling no state in the mdb has passed a legislative instrument dedicated to financial water valuation while some states refer to land valuation in their water legislation others make no mention of the issue nsw excludes water entitlements as part of land valuation but prescribes no methods for valuation in the water management act 2000 nsw the queensland water act 2000 qld mentions the market value of entitlements for compensation purposes but does not identify a corresponding valuation method it seems that the victorian water act 1989 vic addressed financial water valuation the most comprehensively requiring water entitlements to be valued by a certified valuer and exit fees in irrigation districts should represent the present value of all future fees payable but while the act prescribes discounted cash flow valuation for exit fees it provides no guidance on water entitlement valuation in contrast the act and sa have no provisions for water valuation in their legislation water resources act 2007 act natural resources management act 2004 sa for an overview of relevant water valuation legislation see appendix table a2 hence in the absence of dedicated guidelines in the mdb the choice of water valuation and financial water accounting practice lies with the evaluator and raises the research question of what methods are stakeholders applying and what are the potential consequences that arise from various valuation methods 3 data collection and analysis a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to explore a variety of water trade water ownership strategic risk management water valuation and accounting methods issues in the mdb this paper reports the findings from 64 semi structured interviews conducted with bankers evaluators ewhs investors and water brokers across the mdb given the fact that there are 1 no standard industry and legislative valuation methods 2 no publicly available register of water entitlement valuations and 3 the commercial in confidence practise of valuations we chose a qualitative method of data collection to understand these stakeholders water valuation strategies to specifically target large and prominent organisations with expert knowledge in water entitlement valuation water trading and agri business lending in the southern mdb such as banks evaluators and water brokers we used publicly available information to first identify relevant organisations and individuals within and as a second step a chain referral approach to recruit additional interview participants biernacki and waldorf 1981 consequently the qualitative interviews focussed on the views and valuation approaches of large and corporatised organisations given that the common approach to valuation employed both by government and industry is to contract large evaluation firms to undertake water entitlement valuations then our method of recruitment was aimed at understanding the methods by these firms the interviews were conducted mostly face to face in mid to late 2018 at times and locations convenient for respondents with 25 of interviews undertaken by phone and two respondents provided written submissions overall we approached 83 eligible individuals or organisations for interview and hence obtained a response rate of 77 recruitment continued until saturation was reached namely when no new information and themes were identified the incompleteness of one written submission meant it was excluded hence only 63 responses are included here interview recordings and transcripts were compiled into nvivo11 a qualitative data analysis software package and manually coded into major themes the interviews had a median length of 60 min and comprised three main stakeholder groups namely 1 15 ewh employees 2 27 water market investors financial investors and agri corporates and 3 21 bankers 6 water brokers 6 and water evaluators 10 7 7 note we interviewed a few respondents who worked for the same organisation this was because some ewhs and evaluators operate across multiple states with water management or valuation decisions made at the local level making it necessary to interview a variety of local representatives we grouped bankers water brokers and water evaluators together in the analysis as they do not own water and base their income on water related services rather than primary production ewhs are public or private entities owning or delivering water entitlements or allocations for environmental purposes investors own and or trade water to generate non commission income from water trading or revenues from growing crops the majority e g 20 of these were investors and agri corporates very large landholders owning and or trading water but generated their main income from farming while 7 were financial investors non landholders trading water for financial gain bankers represent financial institutions with significant portfolios in agribusiness and water entitlement lending water brokers generated commission based revenue from water market transactions evaluators are specialised in rural agribusiness and water valuations the socio economics were that 84 of our respondents were male with 70 of the female respondents working for ewhs and 75 of respondents have had experience in their current or a similar previous role for more than 10 years however our analysis suggested responses were mainly driven by the stakeholder group rather than by job experience or gender in addition this study applied a quantitative case study methodology to illustrate the monetary impact of using different water valuation methods the case study was the strategic water purchase by the commonwealth from kia ora a queensland property owned by eastern australian agriculture for the purpose of returning water from consumptive to environmental use we collected relevant water register data and used various water valuation methods to illustrate the differences in water values from different techniques applied 4 results and discussion the results are broken down into two main themes water valuation methods and water accounting methods over two thirds 68 of all participants discussed water valuation and water accounting in detail during the interviews with most comments respectively provided by bankers evaluators and water brokers investors and then ewhs 4 1 water valuation methods table 1 summarises the valuation methods and data sources considered by respondents 43 respondents commented on water valuation methods relative valuation methods based on current water market entitlement prices and transaction data were most commonly used other methods included adopting the broker price purchase price or using volume weighted average prices based on different lengths of data 6 18 months respondents explained that only transaction data between non distressed at arms length counterparties 8 8 there is no standard legal definition of non distressed counterparties rather evaluators apply an economic definition similar to the definition in land valuation bill 2010 qld meaning a transaction under reasonable terms without time pressure this is a core principle of commercial valuation is considered excluding transactions resulting from liquidation or bankruptcy 9 9 this stems from land valuation practices where transactions from liquidation are significantly discounted the nsw water register tracks water trades as a result of liquidation as 71x trades but they are unidentified in other state registers and 19 of respondents mentioned other valuation methods these alternative methods included 1 valuations based on historic and future allocation volume 2 associated production 3 long term average annual yield ltaay e g see cheesman and wheeler 2012 p 68 4 statistical and time series analysis and 5 capital asset pricing type valuation models in the stakeholder interviews respondents discussed in depth some water valuation challenges in particular comments were made in regards to thin water markets also called illiquid markets which refers to areas of trade with only a small number of market participants or very few trade transactions over multiple years tisdell 2011 the biggest challenge with thin markets was the absence of high quality data stakeholders addressed this gap by using water trade data from comparable water products in other regions based on reliability or property sales data for example evaluators consulted stock and station agents for the water value proportion of a property transaction we take out the value of the land structures apportion value to all those things and then work back to what an in situ value of water might be but it can be very difficult in those instances and people can have a wide variety of opinions as to what they think it might be worth evaluator only very rarely is a competing valuation undertaken by a different company to negotiate a valuation outcome or an entitlement valued at a discount to the market in an attempt to adjust for scarce or biased data there is a fair amount of discretionary space to choose data sources and methods for valuation but strong personal contacts in the real estate sector and to other evaluators are considered paramount to improve data availability on the other hand in a highly liquid water market respondents rate data quality and availability less of a concern for water valuation there are components of the water market that are still immature but largely across the southern connected system i think it s a very dynamic very well informed market evaluator however table 1 highlights there is still an element of discretion even for liquid markets particularly around data cleaning and data sources used another area of discretion is the time period all participants used entitlement trade data from the relevant state water registers but problems with data reported meant the need to clean data sets for example there are a large number of zero priced transactions representing either trades without a valid contract e g ewh trade or transfer or price not reported low and high outlier prices and data reporting lags of up to a few months de bonviller et al 2019 mdba 2019b it is common practice to exclude zero price trades from valuation or use median prices but adjustment for outlier values is less straight forward especially in less liquid markets abnormally high prices for water entitlements can appear for a number of reasons in nsw for example there is incentive to over value the water component of a bigger land transaction in order to minimise stamp duty fees given water s exempt status revenue nsw personal communication 11 11 2019 the act nsw queensland and sa water registers currently do not contain information on combined land water transactions allowing inflated water prices to enter unrecognised mdba 2019b water registers also do not contain information on whether an entitlement transaction included allocation or carry over volume deloitte 2019 these are called dry and wet water sales with wet sales containing allocation or carry over volume prices of wet entitlement sales are higher as a portion of the value is in the form of water allocations some respondents adjust their valuation by referring back to a dry entitlement price others implicitly assume that entitlements are wet dry at certain times of the year and this reflects in market prices i try and go back to a dry value if i can but obviously our evaluations are at a certain period of time we re taking it as at that date and if you re selling water that s got a bit of temporary water included then you re going to get a little bit of a premium evaluator the scale of a particular water entitlement transaction can also lead to outlier prices referred to as scalability by respondents the issue arises from water entitlements trading at a premium or discount corresponding to its transaction size some respondents argued that larger parcels of water trade for a premium with the buyer paying for the convenience and lower transaction costs of not having to aggregate the volume from smaller parcels 10 10 entitlement transactions require on average 13 2 hours per trade to finalize can include trading fees of on average aud 24 1064 transfer when crossing irrigation infrastructure operator boundaries and water broker commission of 1 5 or 3 0 of transaction value for sellers and buyers respectively loch et al 2018 a single large transaction can also incur a premium due to perceived less reputational risk and backlash in rural communities compared to many small transactions i think a continuing trend that s witnessed is that we typically see a premium of some sort for a larger parcel when compared to a smaller parcel evaluator on the other hand some respondents noted that smaller parcels of water trade at a premium because they are more affordable and attract a bigger pool of buyers smaller parcels have the higher premium someone has got 100 ml and they buy this 10 ml parcel for 4 100 ml all they ve done is made the average cost of their water go from 2200 ml to 2300 ml and the addition of throwing in 10 ml and they slowly accumulate on the basis of being able to afford it investor bankers evaluators and water brokers pointed to water broker data as an important source of information to mitigate shortcomings in the water registers particularly to address time lags while some respondents rely on a single broker many consult a number of water broker platforms in order to get a comprehensive market picture evaluators use property sales data sourced from real estate agents or the parties involved to identify the value apportioned to water in land water transactions some organisations also maintain internal databases on transactions or valuations undertaken our best evidence is what our clients are actually selling and buying i see every formal valuation that s done so we have a big database of what other valuers are putting on water banker respondents also discussed the time period used to value water entitlements while some include data from the last month only others consider up to the previous 18 months of data investors seem to prefer more recent data whereas bankers and ewhs use longer periods we tend to have a rolling benchmark so that looks back 18 months what the price has been doing another way in which we look at it we look at the last six to twelve months banker while most mdb water valuations use relative valuation methods in liquid markets discretion is exercised around what periods of data and what data sources to draw upon and around water value assumptions this often makes it difficult to compare different valuations as assumptions and methodology are often scarcely documented or commercial in confidence although some valuations contain explanatory footnotes these likely do not attract much attention as managers fixate on the valuation number as the main source of information briers et al 1997 while variations in valuations based on different approaches might be minor in liquid markets and where water values are not rapidly increasing it can have a substantial impact for thin markets as demonstrated in the following case study 4 1 1 case study strategic purchase of water from eastern australian agriculture the strategic purchase of water from eastern australian agriculture by the commonwealth department of agriculture and water resources dawr and now titled the department of agriculture as part of the basin plan to return water from consumptive to environmental use illustrates the impact of different valuation methods assumptions and evaluators discretion the dawr acquired 28 740 ml of overland flow water entitlements in the condamine balonne region from eastern australian agriculture s properties kia ora and clyde via a strategic purchase in august 2017 dawr 2018 for a definition of overland flow licences and their difference to unbundled water entitlements see the glossary in appendix table a1 the purchase included the condition that eastern australian agriculture must decommission levee banks and structures which allowed it to harvest the overland flows for the licences in question the publicly available documents state that this removal is done by the company at no cost the senate 2018 p 412 of the purchase value of aud 78 9 million aud 38 95 million was apportioned to 14 190 ml of unsupplemented condamine balonne water entitlements overland flow licences from kia ora while the purchase received initial attention in the senate in 2018 slattery and campbell 2018 the senate 2018 it attracted major public interest in the 2019 federal election campaign west 2019 wroe 2019 one key issue was whether the price paid by strategic purchase namely in negotiation with the company not on the open market was value for money for the type of water entitlements acquired davies 2019 given the relevant water valuation documentation was not publicly available dawr 2019 the senate 2018 grafton and williams 2019 have argued that the kia ora purchase in particular was an example of rent seeking behaviour by vested irrigation and corporate agriculture interests seeking to benefit from unduly high water entitlement valuations although government policy regarding strategic purchases is meant to give regard to socio economic impacts 11 11 the government has stated it prefers strategic water purchases over voluntary water buybacks as they are believed to have less socio economic consequences dawr 2018 part of a strategic purchase application is to demonstrate that the purchase has no or negligible socio economic impacts the senate 2018 pp 369 371 however socio economic impacts on a farm level are then used to justify a particular water price by evaluators based on the in production value of water and its impact on farm viability if the farm is less viable a higher price is seen as justified the senate 2018 p 389 dawr 2018 a government commissioned assessment by nceconomics deemed the kia ora water purchase to have negligible socio economic impacts for the region 12 12 the nceconomics assessment established that the strategic purchase 1 has a negligible impact on regional production and employment 2 would reduce eastern australian agriculture s land under irrigation by only 9 in higher flow years and less in normal years without adverse impacts on farm viability and 3 would constrain regional peak production higher flow years by 2 3 or 14 900 19 100 bales of cotton and 8 10 seasonal labour positions offset by alternative dryland cropping the senate 2018 the senate 2018 in 2017 an evaluator estimated a value for kia ora water entitlements based on 1 historic sales evidence 2 an estimation of the ltaay based on 1922 1995 data and 3 the difference in property value with and without water leading to a negotiated price of aud 2745 ml the government s competing valuation by nceconomics reduced the estimated ltaay of kia ora water from 14 190 ml to 12 983 ml based on 1985 2009 data leading to a 9 difference in purchase cost the senate 2018 to illustrate the impact of an evaluator s discretion and the implications for water prices we undertook a relative valuation of comparable water products such as unregulated water licences in the gwydir the barwon darling and the nsw intersecting streams and the more reliable 13 13 goulburn high security water yields a full allocation 95 years out of 100 with this allocation supported by storage infrastructure it also provides access to carry over a gwydir general security entitlement yields a full allocation 36 years out of 100 a kia ora unregulated overland flow licence 12 years out of 100 and are not supported by storage infrastructure this makes goulburn hs reg a more valuable entitlement cheesman and wheeler 2012 hargraves et al 2013 the senate 2018 water entitlement of regulated high security hs reg 1a goulburn in victoria for the given time period fig 2 it would have been within the evaluator s discretion to value the water at the median of condamine balonne or comparable overland flow licences as it was also in their discretion to choose 1922 1995 or 1985 2009 as the ltaay base given the lack of transparency and information regarding the purchase price of kia ora it is not possible to state why the value seemed higher than what could be expected however what can be verified is that if the commonwealth paid the median market price the purchase cost would have been around 42 97 less depending on the unregulated reference licence see table 2 while kia ora water could have traded at a premium due to its size 14 190 ml given government does prefer larger parcels to decrease its transaction costs per water transfer other aspects of its unregulated nature arguably do not warrant a price premium to the extent of making the water more expensive than the more reliable entitlement of goulburn high security 4 1 2 water valuation summary this study is limited by its focus on primarily qualitative data which hinder attempts at quantifying the impacts of different valuation methods future studies should analyse a dataset of real water valuations which was not available for this study 14 14 water entitlement valuations are often commercially in confidence and not publicly available if available valuation methodology and assumptions sections are usually redacted there is no register containing water valuations while a public central register for land and property valuations exists in some states it contains only the final value but not the actual valuation report however having access to the valuation report in particularly the valuation methods and assumptions sections is necessary to quantify the impact of evaluators discretion to quantify the monetary impacts of different assumptions and methods data cleaning and evaluators discretion on water entitlement valuations nevertheless our results provide a useful illustration of water valuation practices and their challenges while water valuation follows similar processes to the valuation of agricultural land i e market value of the asset at valuation date which may be due to continuation of the practice of irrigated land valuation prior to unbundling the assets are arguably very different water entitlements are more volatile than land and in many cases extremely liquid traded routinely in large volumes on active markets despite these differences a dedicated water valuation methodology has yet to emerge the current legislative and valuation industry s guidelines are fairly inconclusive on the treatment of water assets leaving much to evaluators discretion there is a lack of clearly defined methodologies and guidelines in the current practice of water valuation and accounting in the mdb confirming the findings of other studies christ and burritt 2017b tingey holyoak 2019 insights from the case study and respondents water valuation comments highlight how the valuation process can be sensitive to bias as it relies heavily on secondary data that is not always reported correctly nor transparent this is particularly pronounced in thin markets where data scarcity and quality arguably require the use of longer time periods and multiple data sources in addition commercial valuation relies on the notion of non distressed counterparties an interesting application of this involves government water recovery with environmental water recovery targets for each catchment and the corresponding deadline in form of the requirements of the basin plan public knowledge this condition is arguably violated hence the government could be seen as a distressed buyer under a strategic purchase regime particularly in thin markets with a high concentration of water entitlement ownership market power and a significant portion of the environmental water recovery still to recover various interests may be able to extract unduly high water entitlement prices due to government distress similarly evaluators method choices and assumptions could drive valuation outcomes and hence provides opportunities for rent seeking 4 2 water accounting systems the other major theme identified by our respondents was how water value was reported in accounting systems with distinct practices identified for banks ewhs and investors 4 2 1 accounting by banks water as collateral security bankers explained a mdb water entitlement can be accepted as a security for a loan or mortgage the value of this security is a function of the entitlements market value established by water valuation and a risk adjustment 15 15 banks adjust for the risk of the mortgagor defaulting the liquidity and collateral security bankers explained that standard lending risk metrics such as debt equity ratio historic income and cash flow are considered as well as the agribusiness banker s expertise and judgement about the farm enterprise otherwise known as an internal lending margin or extension rate some banks undertake water valuation in house others contract external valuation services due to conflict of interest larger or more complex valuations tend to be done externally whereas simpler valuation tasks stay in house most banker respondents conceded that experience with water as a security is limited and banks therefore employ a more conservative extension rate for water than for land in addition some banks reduce the valuation amount by 10 before applying the extension rate most also prefer to mortgage against a mix of water and land assets leading to a higher extension rate for water as part of an asset mix and to not lend against water entitlements alone it is known that water entitlements are less protected than land in legal terms first water entitlements are a statutory property right making them less protected from regulatory change than a land title fisher 2010 second banks can directly access the money from a land sale to satisfy their mortgage whereas such a provision does not exist in every state for water entitlement sales as the money can go straight to the seller 16 16 nsw qld and vic legislation rule that caveats can be placed on water entitlements entitlements can only be transferred if agreed by the mortgagee and in the case of default proceeds of water sales need to satisfy mortgages first water act 1989 vic water act 2000 qld water management act 2000 nsw in contrast sa legislation allows for caveats to be placed on water entitlements but does not provide mortgagees with veto powers nor does it dictate the use of proceeds from water sales in case of default natural resources management act 2004 sa there are cases where the water owner took the money defaulted on the mortgage and disappeared leaving it to the bank to chase the money through litigation although one third of the bankers interviewed accepted water entitlements as security by themselves they are subject to lower extension rates ranging between 50 70 representing a 10 20 discount as compared to agricultural land extension rates note that banks still negotiate the terms of the mortgage and extension rates only determine securities value if it s part of a wider transaction that involves farming land so dirt and water and water being used on the land then we ll lend up to 70 of the water value if it s a transaction where it s not being used specifically by the owner or a related party of the owner for farming purposes so it s more of a speculative investment type purchase then we reduce that to 50 banker once a mortgage has been negotiated banks do not adjust the value of the water asset until revaluation again revaluation periods depend on the bank they may for example be yearly every three years or only for intended re mortgage 4 2 2 accounting by ewh water as environmental asset ewh respondents account for the value of their water assets at historic cost less impairment aasb 2019b the relevant cost is heavily influenced by the way water was initially acquired purchase price if the water was bought on the market or the value apportioned to water recovered as part of a strategic purchase or infrastructure upgrade dawr 2018 for strategic purchases the water value relies heavily on external valuation for water entitlements acquired through infrastructure upgrades they can cost a premium of up to 7 1 times the market price once transaction program costs are taken into account productivity commission 2018 finally for water entitlements transferred from another entity for free e g gift of environmental water entitlements by the victorian government to the victorian environmental water holder vewh 2018 the cost is aud 0 ml 17 17 this is generally the case for ewhs when no cost purchase price or cost of infrastructure efficiency program can be attributed to a particular water entitlement e g bulk water entitlements outside of the mdb these costs remain unadjusted in ewh accounts save annual impairment testing until revaluation which only occurs in active markets however ewh respondents often argue that there is no active market for environmental water since it is never to be sold in practice this leads to environmental water assets being massively undervalued most water entitlements have appreciated considerably from the time the majority of ewhs acquired their portfolios and impairment adjustment cannot exceed the initial cost the practice of claiming no active market to avoid revaluation has likely evolved within public ewhs with the aim to avoid treasury calls for revenue from water assets although most public ewhs are not required to recover costs or create revenue but rather manage their water for environmental benefit o donnell 2013 2018 this is not the case for all and subject to regulatory change one respondent explained that as water entitlements are listed on a state s asset register they reported that the treasury argues that water assets are contributing to a state s bottom line and need to be valued at market value there is then perhaps an argument that they should therefore recover the associated costs of holding and using the asset licencing and trading fees requiring ewhs to create a monetary return through allocation sales however ewhs prefer to manage water for environmental benefits not cost recovery the model where government absorbs the costs in some other mechanism and the ewh just has to go about their business as managing the water is the preferred model ewh there are some ewhs that employ a market valuation approach for entitlements acquired through direct purchase although water recovered through infrastructure upgrades remains at cost this approach allows ewhs to represent water ownership value closer to the current market better informing water portfolio rebalancing decisions 4 2 3 accounting by financial investors and agri corporates all businesses list their water portfolio value in their balance sheets but the accounting framework differs for entitlements held for production or as part of an investment asset portfolio when water entitlements govern water held for production water entitlements are treated as intangible assets with an indefinite life span accounted for at historic cost less impairment with the purchase price as the historic cost aasb 2019b in contrast to ewhs investors agri corporates revalue their entitlements at fair market value however this often occurs infrequently for example family farms tend to account for entitlements at cost for multiple years without revaluing and only revalue if required by their bank while some investors revalue their water assets annually this was not standard process amongst our respondents non landholder financial investors hold water entitlements as part of a real asset investment portfolio they value water entitlements at current market prices and revalue at a high frequency sometimes every month making sure the market asset value is represented at all times this provides transparency and enables shareholders to make swift decisions about portfolio restructure we are an investment fund we have to hold water at its fair market value based on aasb13 fair value measurement in our books rather than historic cost that s important for us because our members can trade in and out of our product daily we need to have an up to date market valuation so that we can ensure they re trading in and out at fair market value financial investor historical cost accounting has implications for investors agri corporates having a significant part of their asset value not reflected in financial statements can make communication with shareholders difficult as well as not reflecting the true value of the company my previous employer had water that was at about a tenth of its value on the books that just suggests that the accounting standards are back to front investor by accounting for water at fair value aasb 2019a financial investors have stronger balance sheets which is advantageous when trying to attract investor interest and credit opportunities however one banker respondent claimed that the balance sheet value of water has no bearing on credit decisions financial institutions take no notice of the value in the balance sheet when it comes to property and that s why they do valuations on water and at the end of the day the bank manager and the customer know the true value of the asset banker one potential reason for this may be the difference between the market value of water as represented by comparative valuations versus the value of the water used by the business all businesses will have differing marginal values of water e g see wheeler et al 2014b estimates for differing buy and sell water trade values for various irrigation industries the true value the respondent refers to is likely the marginal value of water for a particular business which can be different to the book value 18 18 however due to accounting treatment under aasb138 intangible assets aasb 2019b book value is impaired when water prices fall below the initial purchase price therefore the current market value can only ever be equal or larger than the book value and different to the current market value 4 2 4 accounting framework summary financial water accounting practice in australia broadly follows historical cost or fair value accounting practices set out by the aasb aasb 2019a 2019b however as aasb standards only have to be used by reporting entities such as asx200 listed or companies with significant external stakeholders water accounting by smaller businesses is not impacted this leads to a wide variety of water values being reported without much transparency about assumptions or the accounting framework used this is exasperated by the sometimes poor quality of water entitlement ownership data misreporting the location and security of stakeholders water entitlement ownership consequently comparing different water asset portfolios is challenging at best historical cost accounting particularly has been criticised as obscuring real performance providing largely irrelevant information and leading to poorer business decision making argilÃ©s bosch et al 2012 barlev and haddad 2003 this resonates with the concern that smaller businesses are disadvantaged in accessing capital since an important part of their asset base namely water entitlements are often undervalued due to historical cost accounting and infrequent re evaluation given the maturity of southern mdb water markets fair value accounting for water assets is possibly more transparent more reflective of economic realities and arguably easier than historical cost accounting more transparent water accounting frameworks reflecting the current value of water provide important information for stakeholders and may enable better water management transparency in accounting can also build trust in the water market system wheeler et al 2017 the mdb case points to important aspects for water valuation and accounting globally current water accounting initiatives on the business scale are not standardized they focus mainly on physical water information and water use but do not pay attention to water asset values burritt and christ 2017 tingey holyoak 2019 future studies should pay more attention to financial water values and attempt to incorporate these values better into existing accounting frameworks with water increasingly becoming a sought after investment asset with increased non landholder ownernership plus being an important part of irrigators assets water accounting needs to adequately reflect the fair value of the asset rather than its historic cost or just the cost of provision and physical volumes while some basin scale water accounting frameworks envision financial water accounting conceptually they provide little instruction on best practice water valuation methods clear standards and methodologies for both accounting and valuation are necessary to enable transparent and comparable assessment of financial water asset value for diverse stakeholders to underpin the hydrological integrity and financial water asset values physical accounting considering net water consumption on a basin scale grafton et al 2018 and financial fair value accounting of water rights reflecting current market values are paramount transparent valuation of water resources should follow a standardised approach in regards to data cleaning data sources considered and valuation methods employed in addition governance regulation and corruption have been identified as important issues for water markets globally o donnell and garrick 2019 therefore when water valuations concern government expenditure we suggest that methods data and assumptions used should be publicly available rather than commercial in confidence to 1 increase accountability 2 demonstrate value for money 3 discourage rent seeking by vested interests and 4 engender trust in government processes grafton and williams 2019 wheeler et al 2017 furthermore in situations where the government is perhaps classified as a distressed buyer to recover water standard commercial valuation methodology might not be appropriate to discern the value of water rights 5 conclusion this study used qualitative information from 63 interviews with water experts banks evaluators ewhs investors and water brokers and case study quantitative information to highlight issues associated with 1 water entitlement valuation and 2 water accounting frameworks the majority of respondents used relative valuation namely current market value to value water entitlements as well as other methods such as purchase price and volume weighted average price bankers value water on a longer period of water market data 6 18 months whereas evaluators largely rely on information within the last six months water register and water broker data were the most commonly used data sources issues associated with valuation include transparency and accuracy of water market data larger versus smaller water parcels transaction costs and fees and wet versus dry trades these are particularly impactful in thin water markets where data availability and quality are poor we show that the use of different data and methods can have a meaningful impact on valuation values as demonstrated in the kia ora commonwealth s strategic purchase case study where the same water entitlement could have been valued anywhere between aud 95 2745 per ml and it is highly likely that the commonwealth paid considerably more up to 97 more than they should have due to evaluator discretion in the mdb physical water accounting is limited by its focus on gross extraction rather than net consumption of water financial water accounting frameworks value water at historical cost less impairment or fair value bankers stated they applied extension rates between 50 60 to water valuations whereas rates between 60 70 apply to agricultural land for mortgage and security purposes on the other hand financial investors owning water as part of a real asset investment portfolio revalue assets monthly at current market prices ewhs undertake yearly impairment testing but do not revalue their portfolio as they claim there is no active market for environmental water the difference in accounting can lead to a material divergence in reported water portfolio values between stakeholders making comparisons challenging the predominant use of historical cost accounting by small businesses could disadvantage them in regards to access to capital these findings highlight that there are no clear standards for water valuation and financial water accounting and we illustrated this impact on water asset values physical water accounting does not report real availability of water resources as it is based on an assessment of gross extractions there is a need for proper water accounting across the whole basin accounting for return flows and all water consumed the processes of financial water valuation and accounting are confusing and potentially obfuscating enabling rent seeking by various interests as illustrated by a series of inquiries a mdb royal commission and considerable public interest in government water valuation of strategic environmental water purchases there is a compelling need for transparent and open water management valuation and financial water accounting greater transparency and a standardised water valuation method clearly identifying assumptions made would reinforce the development of water markets both in the mdb and worldwide proper accounting practice is important to discharge organisations responsibilities for water management and purchase against its stakeholders contributing to greater trust in institutions and governance which is a vital issue for all water
