4560,in irrigated semi arid watersheds over fertilization often leads to nitrogen n and phosphorus p contamination in aquifers and river systems modelling tools often are used to evaluate the effect of management practices on nutrient contamination levels in this study we assess a suite of best management practices bmps for n and p in a regional irrigated stream aquifer system using a new numerical model as it is necessary to consider the interaction of flow in the stream and aquifer swat modflow model that couples surface and groundwater flow was used the reactive processes were modelled using rt3d that simulate the reactive groundwater transport the model is based on the coupled flow model swat modflow with the groundwater reactive transport model rt3d included to simulate the reactive groundwater transport of no3 and soluble p and their interactions within the soil aquifer stream system the assessment is performed for a highly managed 732 km2 region in the lower arkansas river valley south eastern colorado with model results compared to observed groundwater nutrient concentration in stream nutrient concentration and loading and crop yield a total of 28 bmps scenarios are evaluated regarding their impact on no3 and soluble p contamination in the aquifer and river system the most effective individual bmp in most areas is to decrease fertilizer by 30 resulting in no3 and soluble p reduced by 20 and 2 for groundwater concentrations 25 and 10 for river concentrations and 27 and 6 for mass loadings into surface water respectively combinations of using 30 irrigation reduction 30 fertilization reduction 60 canal seepage reduction and conservation tillage yield the greatest overall impact to lower no3 and soluble p concentrations up to 41 and 8 in groundwater 52 and 40 in river and 63 and 49 for mass loadings targeting bmps on localized problem areas shows great promise in reducing contamination while maintaining region wide crop yield the study demonstrates the swat modflow rt3d modelling code is a useful tool to examine no3 and p transport and quantify bmp effects in groundwater driven watersheds keywords nitrate phosphorus swat modflow rt3d surface and groundwater solute transport modelling intensively irrigated system bmp 1 introduction nitrogen n and phosphorus p are essential elements for plant growth but their application in agricultural areas has resulted in a serious environmental issues for both surface water and groundwater monaghan et al 2005 dechmi and skhiri 2013 cerro et al 2014 between 1964 and 1999 irrigation activities and food production doubled resulting in a 7 fold increase in the use of n based fertilizer and a 3 fold increase in p based fertilizer huizenga et al 2017 the enrichment of n and p in agricultural systems has resulted in eutrophication of lakes and rivers a major environmental concern throughout the world omernik et al 1981 smith 2003 volk et al 2009 e g more than half of all surface water bodies in europe are impaired by nutrient pollution poikane et al 2019 however established nutrient standards of n and p vary by water type and by environmental agency in europe established threshold concentrations of n range between 0 25 and 35 mg l for lakes reservoirs and 0 25 4 0 mg l for streams rivers whereas in the usa the state prepared thresholds range from 0 1 to 4 0 mg l for lakes reservoirs and 0 1 10 mg l for streams rivers poikane et al 2019 usepa 2019 for p threshold concentrations range from 5 to 500 µg l for lakes reservoirs and from 5 to 2500 µg l for streams rivers poikane et al 2019 usepa 2019 no3 and soluble p can be transported to streams via surface runoff soil lateral flow and groundwater discharge dupas et al 2015 constantino et al 2017 gurung et al 2021 no3 is highly mobile in soil water and groundwater with minimal sorption when fertilizer application exceeds the crop demand and denitrification capacity of the soil no3 can dissolve and leach into the underlying alluvial aquifer and then load to streams via groundwater discharge du et al 2016 zhang 2016 zimnicki et al 2020 p is usually considered to be highly immobile with significant sorption to soil colloids or organic matter in topsoil or the shallow subsurface leading to high p concentration in surface runoff during irrigation events or rainfall events kovacs et al 2008 however soluble p can leach to the water table and be transported to streams sharpley 1995 for many irrigated agricultural systems reactive transport of no3 and soluble p in the aquifer system has a strong influence on the storage of n and p and greatly affects the timing and amount of n and p mass loading to surface water wei et al 2018a understanding and accounting for nutrient storage and transport is essential for assessing baseline conditions in watersheds and identifying effective nutrient management strategies particularly for highly managed agricultural watersheds where complex hydrologic pathways can occur between surface water and groundwater numerous methods have been proposed to identify best management practices bmps for nutrient management bmps include efficient use of irrigation water abdelraouf and ragab 2018 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 decreasing fertilizer loading almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 schilling and wolter 2009 enhancing soil covers gaynor and findlay 1995 bosch et al 2013 almendinger and ulrich 2017 and associated combinations novotny 2002 rong and xuefeng 2011 zhang et al 2013 dozier et al 2017 chukalla et al 2018 robertson et al 2018 deng and bailey 2020 often the effect of proposed bmps on n and p concentrations and loadings is evaluated using computational modelling tools the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 a watershed model that simulates water and nutrient transport via surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow and streamflow using water and nutrient balances on a daily time step is the most commonly used model to assess nutrient bmps with hundreds of studies published since the year 2000 e g secchi et al 2007 tuppad et al 2010 waidler et al 2011 özcan et al 2017 bailey et al 2019 zimnicki et al 2020 with many studies focusing solely on p santhi et al 2006 dechmi and skhiri 2013 rousseau et al 2013 lamba et al 2016 taylor et al 2016 malagó et al 2017 other modelling tools include simplifications of swat for field scale nutrient export white et al 2010 or simple models that link source areas to water bodies using digital elevation models and travel time indices buchanan et al 2013 kovacs et al 2008 a second group of models use physical based spatially distributed groundwater flow and solute transport models such as the groundwater flow model modflow harbaugh 2005 and the groundwater solute transport models mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 or rt3d clement 1997 or their derivatives conan et al 2003 wriedt and rode 2006 almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 bailey et al 2013 however these modelling approaches have focused typically only on n contamination while each model type works well for selected watersheds major components of n and p transport in watershed systems are either treated simplistically or are not included swat simulates both n and p transport but its simplified representation of groundwater flow processes and groundwater surface water interaction often results in poor performance in watershed systems wherein groundwater discharge is a significant component of stream flow chu and shirmohammadi 2004 gassman et al 2007 as a result accurate timing and amount of water and nutrient loading from the aquifer to the stream cannot be produced conversely aquifer focused models such as mt3dms and rt3d neglect soil and land surface hydrologic pathways such as surface runoff and lateral flow and do not include the transport of p species wei et al 2018a included no3 transport to swat modflow bailey et al 2016 which includes pbsd groundwater flow but was not applied to bmps and did not include p transport to our knowledge no study has developed a comprehensive tool for assessing the effectiveness of bmps to reduce both n and p in a highly managed stream aquifer system the objective of this paper is two fold 1 present a version of swat modflow rt3d that simulates fate and transport of both no3 and soluble p in agricultural watersheds and 2 use the model to evaluate the effect of a suite of bmps on no3 and soluble p storage and contamination in an intensively irrigated stream aquifer system for the latter nutrient concentration and loading will be assessed for both the aquifer and the river system the model is applied to a 732 km2 region of the lower arkansas river valley larv in southeastern colorado and builds on the work of bailey et al 2015 who assessed bmp impact on groundwater no3 concentrations and loading and shultz et al 2018 who assessed bmp impact on no3 concentrations in the coupled groundwater surface water system however these latter studies did not include land surface hydrology the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a description of swat modflow rt3d and the coupled swat modflow rt3d model including n and p cycling and transport modification section 3 presents the application of the model to baseline conditions in the larv study region section 4 outlines proposed bmps and a presentation of modelling results and an overall ranking of bmps section 5 provides a summary and conclusions 2 swat modflow rt3d for n and p transport this section first introduces the swat and modflow models followed by the previous version of swat modflow rt3d for no3 transport wei et al 2018a and then modifications to swat modflow rt3d to simulate combined no3 and p transport and include nutrient mass in irrigation water fig 1 shows the n and p processes simulated in the new version of swat modflow rt3d which will be explained in detail in section 2 5 2 1 swat model for n and p transport the swat model is a physically based spatially semi distributed watershed model arnold et al 1998 that computes water and nutrient mass balances on a daily time step the model has been widely used to evaluate the impact of different agricultural conservation practices in large complex watersheds under varying management conditions arabi et al 2007 dechmi and skhiri 2013 marek et al 2017 ahn et al 2018 wei et al 2018b in swat the watershed is divided into subbasins based on the river network and user defined threshold drainage area each subbasin is further divided into hydrologic response units hrus with homogeneous land use slope and soil characteristics the hru is the smallest landscape component of swat with output water fluxes and nutrient fluxes from each hru within a subbasin summed and loaded to the subbasin channel and the resulting flow and loads are routed through channels to the watershed outlet the model integrates all relevant eco hydrologic processes including weather surface flow soil erosion subsurface flow infiltration percolation evapotranspiration et crop growth and irrigation land use management and nutrient transport through watersheds the swat model simulates n and p transformation through several forms between organic and inorganic pools in the nutrient cycle within the root zone tuppad et al 2010 nutrients are introduced into the system through atmospheric fixation plant residue and fertilization while nutrient loss from soil includes surface runoff plant uptake leaching lateral subsurface flow and groundwater flow swat in stream nutrient dynamics are simulated using qual2e kinetic routines brown and barnwell 1987 arnold et al 2013 and in stream transport algorithms 2 2 modflow model the groundwater flow model modflow harbaugh 2005 is a physically based fully distributed model that solves the three dimensional groundwater flow equation using the finite difference method the aquifer domain is discretized laterally and vertically into grid cells with a water balance equation written for each grid cell at each time step sources and sinks can include recharge groundwater et pumping and groundwater surface water exchange aquifer properties specific yield specific storage hydraulic conductivity also are specified for each grid cell the system of equations with one equation for each grid cell is solved for groundwater head at each model time step a new version of modflow modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 is well suited for highly nonlinear problems results simulated by modflow i e groundwater head groundwater flow rates sources sinks rates can be used by groundwater solute transport models such as pht3d prommer et al 2003 laattoe et al 2017 mt3dms pulido velazquez et al 2015 ehtiat et al 2018 and rt3d clement 1997 bailey et al 2014 among these rt3d solves multi species chemical reactions simultaneously using an ordinary differential equation ode solver thus allowing for the concentration of multiple chemical species to be updated simultaneously therefore it allows the concentration of a solute to influence the reaction rates of other chemical species 2 3 swat modflow model several studies have presented a linked modelling system between swat and modflow sophocleous and perkins 2000 kim et al 2008 bailey et al 2016 the most recent version bailey et al 2016 imbeds the modflow subroutines within the swat modelling code with swat calling modflow during each daily time step recharge and unsatisfied potential et from each hru are passed to modflow grid cells via mapping routines and groundwater head and groundwater surface water exchange rates are passed from modflow grid cells to swat hrus and swat subbasin channels respectively swat routines then route water through the subbasin channels to the watershed outlet therefore swat simulates surface runoff and soil lateral flow to subbasin channels whereas modflow simulates groundwater discharge to subbasin channels within this framework modflow also simulates river seepage to the aquifer if the water table adjacent to a stream is below the stream stage this version of swat modflow has been used worldwide in recent years aliyari et al 2019 chunn et al 2019 gao et al 2019 liu et al 2019 molina navarro et al 2019 taie semiromi and koch 2019 wei and bailey 2019 to assess watershed water resources and quantify the impact of pumping and climate change on streamflow and groundwater levels 2 4 rt3d model the numerical code reactive transport in 3 dimensions rt3d simulates the groundwater reactive transport of one or more solutes by solving the advection dispersion reactive adr mass balance equation clement 1997 clement et al 1998 rt3d uses the same finite difference grid as the modflow mode which provides cell by cell groundwater hydraulic head 3d flux rates and groundwater sources and sinks e g recharge pumping the adr equations for a set of solutes in saturated porous media are written as 1 c k t r k x i v i c k x i d ij c k x j q s ϕ c s k r k k 1 2 m where m is the total number of aqueous phase species ck mflf 3 is the solute concentration of the k th species in aqueous phase xi j l is the distance along the respective cartesian coordinate axis dij l2t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient which can be assumed to be independent of solute concentration v lbt 1 is the average groundwater velocity where b denotes the bulk phase ϕ lf 3lb 3 is soil porosity qs lf 3t 1lb 3 is the volumetric flux of water representing sources and sinks of the species c s k mflf 3 is the concentration of the source or sink rk mflf 3t 1 represents the rate of all reactions that occur in the aqueous phase for the k th species and rk is the retardation coefficient for the kth species representing linear sorption with aquifer sediment surface sites therefore the change of solute concentration through time is represented by the four terms on the right hand side of eq 1 advection dispersion sources and sinks mixing and kinetic chemical reactions 2 5 swat modflow rt3d 2 5 1 previous version nitrogen transport the study of wei et al 2018a included rt3d into the swat modflow bailey et al 2016 modelling framework for comprehensive transport of no3 in a watershed setting i e surface runoff soil lateral flow spatially distributed groundwater flow the rt3d model subroutines are imbedded into the modflow routines with rt3d called each daily time step modflow passes groundwater head groundwater flux rates and groundwater sources sink rates to the rt3d grid cells which then solves for no3 groundwater concentration at each grid cell and groundwater no3 loadings to streams with the latter passed to swat subbasin channels for in stream no3 loading through the watershed stream network the model was applied to the upper klamath basin in southern oregon with model output tested against in stream no3 loadings and groundwater no3 concentration wei et al 2018a the following adr equation was used for no3 groundwater transport 2 c n o 3 t r n o 3 x i v i c n o 3 x i d ij c n o 3 x j q s ϕ c s n o 3 r n o 3 with the rate law for denitrification defined using a single monod expression 3 r no 3 μ n o 3 c n o 3 c n o 3 k n o 3 c n o 3 where μ n o 3 is the first order rate constant d 1 for denitrification and k n o 3 is the monod half saturation constant mflf 3 for no3 since no3 does not sorb r n o 3 in equation 2 is set to 1 for all grid cells 2 5 2 model modifications 2 5 2 1 p transport for this study the swat modflow rt3d modelling code of wei et al 2018a was amended to include transport of soluble p in the aquifer and p mass loading exchange between the aquifer and the stream network the cycling and transport of n and p species in the land surface soil aquifer system as simulated by swat modflow rt3d is shown in fig 1 within this system nutrient mass enters the subsurface via atmospheric fixation and fertilizer loading within the soil zone organic p can be mineralized to soluble p which then can be attached to mineral surfaces via sorption organic n can undergo ammonification to ammonium nh4 which can be changed to nitrate no3 through nitrification and then denitrified to nitrogen gas n2 no3 nh4 and soluble p can be either taken up by crop roots and be removed from the system through harvest processes or loaded back to the stream network through lateral flow in the soil zone meanwhile those species can leach downward to the water table through deep percolation where they undergo 3d transport in the saturated zone and can be loaded back to the stream via groundwater discharge no3 and p mass can also be transferred from the aquifer to the land surface via groundwater pumping for irrigation in addition to the adr equation for no3 equation 2 the following adr is included for soluble p transport in the groundwater system 4 c p o 4 t r p o 4 x i v i c p o 4 x i d ij c p o 4 x j q s ϕ c s p o 4 r p o 4 unlike no3 soluble p sorbs strongly to soil and aquifer sediments and hence r p o 4 is 1 as soluble p has no appreciable reduction rate in groundwater system r p o 4 is set to 0 although this study simulates only no3 and p transport in the aquifer other reactive solutes could be implemented into the rt3d reaction module depending on the watershed system 2 5 2 2 n and p mass in irrigation water another modification to the swat modflow rt3d code for this study is the inclusion of no3 and p mass in irrigation water for many watersheds the high concentration of no3 and p in river water and groundwater can add appreciable amounts of solute mass to the land surface during irrigation events in particular if pumped groundwater is used for irrigation irrigation water chemistry can be changed significantly due to the typically much higher concentration of nutrients in groundwater than in surface water mcmahon and böhlke 1996 however the original swat modelling code does not account for nutrient mass in irrigation water in this study the swat modelling code was modified to account for the loading of no3 and soluble p mass to the soil profile via irrigation water from both surface water canal diversions and groundwater pumping if the irrigation water source is a subbasin reach surface water irrigation the concentration mg l of no3 and soluble p in the reach water is used to calculate nutrient mass kg ha 1 that is added to the first soil layer of the corresponding hru where irrigation is applied with the applied nutrient mass removed from the source of the corresponding reach if the irrigation water is provided by the shallow aquifer pumping the nutrient mass kg ha 1 of no3 and p each species is added to the first soil layer of the corresponding hru and then subtracted from the corresponding rt3d grid cell for both sources the nutrient mass in the irrigation water kg ha 1 is calculated as the product of concentration in the irrigation water and the volume of applied irrigation water divided by the hru area 3 swat modflow rt3d application to irrigated stream aquifer systems 3 1 description of study region the lower arkansas river valley larv in southeastern colorado has a long history of rich agricultural production and currently faces challenging issues due to extremely shallow water tables resulting from more than 100 years intensive irrigation seepage from earthen canals and inefficient drainage systems mcmahon and böhlke 1996 gates et al 2012 bailey et al 2012 the study area is a semi arid region located within the larv in southeastern colorado fig 2 a with average annual precipitation of 273 mm the average temperature is 13 6 c with the monthly temperatures ranging from 12 6 c in january to 35 9 c in july it encompasses a total of 732 km2 of which about 330 km2 is agricultural fields with intensive cultivation major crops in order of planted area are alfalfa followed by sorghum corn grass pasture sunflower melons oats onion and soybeans see fig 2b the growing season commences mid to late march and ends in early november with earthen irrigation canals receiving water from the arkansas river during the period of march 15th to november 15th the vast majority of irrigation water is derived from one of six principal irrigation canals rocky ford highline catlin otero rocky ford ditch fort lyon and holbrook with supplemental irrigation water provided by approximately 500 groundwater pumping wells fig 2a over fertilization on cultivated fields has resulted in high surface and groundwater no3 concentrations assessed by numerous monitoring data stream sample sites groundwater observation wells in the study region a first set of field data was collected and analyzed for no3 n between june 2006 and july 2011 with a total of 270 surface water samples and 598 groundwater samples taken from 20 surface sites and 80 monitoring wells fig 2c during 18 sampling events a second set of field data was gathered between june 2014 and february 2016 with both concentrations of no3 n and soluble p sampled at the same surface sites a total of 71 samples and 25 observation wells a total of 193 samples from both data sets the average no3 n and soluble p concentration in surface water is 1 83 mg l 1 and 0 16 mg l 1 respectively compared to the colorado interim nutrient standard of 2 01 mg l 1 and 0 17 mg l 1 for total n and total p 34 and 30 of samples exceeded the standard for no3 and soluble p respectively for groundwater average monitored concentrations for no3 n and soluble p is 4 83 mg l 1 and 0 13 mg l 1 with maximum values of 66 mg l 1 and 1 1 mg l 1 respectively more details of observed data will be presented with model results in section 3 4 3 2 swat modflow rt3d model set up for the larv a previously calibrated and tested swat modflow model for the larv study region is used to link with rt3d to simulate nutrient fate and transport in the study region the swat modflow is detailed in wei and bailey 2019 constructed by linking a calibrated swat model wei et al 2018b that accounts for canal seepage and crop rotations with a calibrated modflow model morway et al 2013 for the study area the model includes new subroutines for groundwater irrigation and groundwater evapotranspiration and provides a detailed description of surface and groundwater flow processes thereby enabling a specific description of watershed processes including streamflow et surface runoff soil later flow infiltration recharge 3d groundwater flow in a heterogeneous aquifer system with various sources and sinks groundwater et and spatio temporal groundwater and surface water interactions the spatial extent of the swat modflow model which is used in this study for swat modflow rt3d is shown in fig 2c the model domain contains 5270 hrus and 72 subbasins with each cultivated field designated as an individual hru complete description of designating each cultivated field as an hru is provided in wei et al 2018b thus management operations such as irrigation application plant growth fertilizer application harvest and kill and tillage operation can be applied to each hru to mimic real world conditions specific management operations for each crop type is listed in table 1 with the values provided via expert opinion from research scientists at the arkansas valley research center avrc located within the study region michael bartolot personal communication the management input file mgt for hrus accommodates crop rotation in continuous years an example of the management file with corn and alfalfa rotation is provided in table 2 in the study area approximately 88 irrigation water is provided by surface water through canals and 12 is provided by groundwater through pumping wells the auto irrigation algorithms in swat were used to trigger irrigation events based on plant water demand for both surface water and groundwater irrigation the value of 0 9 recommended by arnold et al 2012 for auto irrigation threshold in our model is used which means if the crop growth falls below 90 of its optimal value irrigation will be applied the modflow finite difference grid contains 7777 active cells horizontally see fig 2c with a uniform cell size of 250 m 250 m the aquifer is discretized vertically into 3 layers 2 for the alluvial aquifer and one for the shale bedrock which is on average 15 m below ground surface canal seepage from each of the six earthen canals is simulated using modflow s river package with the corresponding canal diverted flows specified as point sinks in swat for groundwater irrigation daily pumping rates are specified in modflow s well package with the volume converted to depths and applied to swat hrus wei and bailey 2019 based on a spatial relationship between the pumping wells and the irrigated hrus example output of stream discharge at the watershed outlet near las animas colorado water table depth and recharge rates from the calibrated swat modflow model are shown in fig 3 as can be seen from the figure the shallowest water table occurs along the river corridors of the arkansas river and the tributaries with the deepest water table occurring away from the river network based on the evaluation criteria defined by moriasi et al 2015 comparison results for the stream hydrograph indicated a very good performance for nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 9 and coefficient of determination r2 0 94 respectively while percent bias pbias can be considered as good with the obtained 11 2 value moriasi et al 2015 the underestimation in peak flow can be attributed to surface runoff from summer thunderstorms originating outside the model domain and hence not captured in the hru runoff routines the underestimation could also be attributed to mis timing of irrigation return flows from the thousands of cultivated fields in the model domain detailed analysis of return flows can be found in wei and bailey 2019 the simulation period for swat modflow rt3d is from april 1999 to february 2016 with the first two years specified as a warm up period initial groundwater no3 and soluble p concentrations for each rt3d grid cell are provided by an 18 year warm up simulation this warm up period was prepared by repeating the weather crop management operation and pumping stresses for the year 2005 for 18 years until the groundwater solute concentrations achieved a steady seasonal fluctuation then the output solute concentrations were used to provide initial concentration for the calibration period of simulation initial values for μ n o 3 k n o 3 and the sorption partition coefficient for soluble p k d p o 4 were set to 0 001 day 1 5 mg l and 2 5 respectively model calibration was carried out using a combination of manual and automated methods zhang et al 2020a one at a time sensitivity analysis was performed manually for the parameters governing nutrient fate and transport up to 20 values within a realistic range were assigned to each parameter while keeping the other parameters constant to test the sensitivity of the in stream mass loading to each parameter tuppad et al 2010 douglas mankin et al 2010 dechmi et al 2012 özcan et al 2017 parameters shown in table 3 were found to be the most influential on nutrient in stream loading at the outlet of the study region then automated parameter estimation was performed with the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup software tool using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi2 abbaspour et al 2015 this allows for only swat parameters to be modified the in stream mass loading at the outlet was first calibrated by swat cup with the parameters listed in table 3 five iterations with a total of 2500 simulations following the procedure used in the original swat model for the study region wei et al 2018b monthly in stream no3 n mass loading was provided by gates et al 2018 who performed a stochastic mass balance on the arkansas river network system using measured stream discharge rates river stages and electrical conductivity in the streams monthly soluble p loading was estimated using the program load estimator loadest runkel et al 2004 by combining the observed daily flow rates with soluble p concentration available from june 2014 to february 2016 then manual calibration was performed using the groundwater transport parameters μ n o 3 k n o 3 and k d p o 4 based on published values mcmahon and böhlke 1996 mcmahon et al 1999 bailey et al 2014 finally swat cup was re run with 500 simulations to fine tune swat nutrient parameters to evaluate the improvement of swat modflow rt3d model over the original swat model the calibrated parameter set was applied directly to the swat model with the modified irrigation method described in section 2 1 model performance is estimated using statistical measures nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 and pbias the model is further verified by comparing simulated and observed groundwater nutrient concentration in stream nutrient concentrations in stream nutrient loadings and crop yield simulated crop yields are compared with county level observed data provided by the national agricultural statistical survey nass https quickstats nass usda gov alfalfa and corn are selected since they are the two major crops in the otero county wherein resides most irrigated fields in the model domain no targeted calibration was performed for crop yield 3 3 baseline model results 3 3 1 nutrient in stream loading and concentration monthly time series plots of simulated and measured nitrate and solute phosphorus in stream loading at the outlet of the watershed are shown in figs 4 a and 5 a respectively the black line with round dots represents the observation values and red lines with triangle dots represent simulations from the swat modflow rt3d model as can be seen from the figures the coupled model is able to track the spatiotemporal variability and magnitude of in stream loading for both species reasonably well for nitrate in stream loading the statistics during calibration period indicate satisfactory nse 0 51 good r2 0 65 and very good pbias 5 45 performance while nse 0 72 r2 0 83 and pbias 4 28 all represent very good performance during the validation period based on moriasi et al 2015 solute phosphorus in stream loading is considered to be very good for nse of 0 82 and r2 of 0 84 and satisfactory for pbias of 23 8 results show a good representation of nutrient in stream loadings during the entire simulation period however the model has lower accuracy to predict loadings for low flow periods especially during mar 12 to jun 13 for nitrate due to under estimation of streamflow simulated by swat modflow fig 3a this under estimation is likely due to the irregular and random management operations carried out locally by different farmers during this period which are difficult to account for accurately in the modelling processes the same issue was reported by other studies in intensively irrigated watersheds shultz et al 2018 wei et al 2021 in addition the nitrate in stream mass loading in this study is calibrated and validated against a stochastic mass balance model developed by gates et al 2018 which also contains uncertainty from measurement error the simulated nitrate in stream mass loading results from our model is located within the 95 inter percentile range black bars in fig 8a which indicates an acceptable model performance in simulating temporal magnitude of nitrate in stream loading at the outlet gage there is a marked improvement for swat modflow rt3d model as compared to the nutrient in stream results using the stand alone swat model wei et al 2018b green lines with rectangular dots in figs 4 a and 5 a the swat model consistently underestimates the nitrate and solute phosphorous in stream loading especially during the irrigation season a statistical comparison of simulated in stream loading at the outlet is given in table 4 one limitation of the calibration and validation process is the lack of long term monitoring time series water quality data this can lead to biased estimation of nutrient concentrations and loads in both surface subsurface water system thus comparisons between daily in stream nutrient concentrations daily groundwater nutrient concentrations at 4 wells and annual crop yield using monitoring field data were applied to further verify the baseline model performance as for nutrient in stream loading the calibrated model is verified by comparing the daily simulated and observed nutrient in stream concentration at the stream gauges sw 12 and sw 162 location is shown in fig 2c the horizontal black line and dot line respectively represent the colorado interim standard in warm water and in cold water time series comparisons for no3 n concentration are plotted from january 2006 to february 2016 fig 4b c whereas soluble p concentrations are only compared from january 2014 to february 2016 fig 5b c due to the availability of observation data in general simulated results are within the estimated error bar of the measured head values of 1 6 mg l 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 for no3 n and soluble p respectively however soluble p often is underestimated in terms of both loading fig 5a and in stream concentration fig 5b c this can be due to a number of reasons including spatially varying sorption rates in the aquifer overestimation of p sorption in soil profiles and underestimation of p attached to sediment in surface runoff however simulated magnitudes and temporal changes in in stream p concentration are within the range of observed p concentrations particularly when considering the error associated with measurement data i e error bars 3 3 2 groundwater nutrient concentrations a map of cell by cell temporally averaged 1999 2016 model results for nutrient concentration is shown in figs 6 a and 7 a no3 n concentrations range from 0 01 to 59 3 mg l 1 and soluble p values range from 0 to 2 12 mg l 1 with high concentration values occurring in irrigation dense areas and along the river corridor simulated and observed nutrient concentration at four groundwater monitoring wells throughout the study region are shown in fig 6 b e for no3 n and in fig 7 b e for soluble p with the location of wells shown in figs 6 a and 7 a for the magnitude of each species these comparisons indicate an acceptable match between the simulated and observed values favorable matches occur for no3 n simulation at well 13 and well 33 that increases and decreases in concentration are generally captured by the coupled model variations of the observed no3 n values at well 93 are not well captured likely due to the proximity to the upstream end of the tributary where groundwater flow and elevations are not well captured by the swat modflow model wei et al 2019 as for well 74 located along the corridor of the river ignoring the processes within the riparian zone which retain the release no3 n depending on seasonally variable environmental conditions could be the reason for the mis match this poor match can also be found for soluble p at the same location thus a future version of the model may include the chemical reaction parameter in the riparian zone to better estimate the influence on the groundwater nutrient concentrations as seen in fig 7 simulated soluble p does not have remarkable seasonal fluctuations during the simulation period in this study considering the great computational effort and the risk of over fitting a constant sorption partition coefficient rate is assigned for soluble p for the entire region however the dynamics of solute p in groundwater is substantially influenced by sorption of phosphorus onto soil particles sharpley 1995 if desired cell by cell sorption rates can be specified and calibrated to yield a better match with daily point measurements under anaerobic environments the presence of manganese sulfate and ferrous iron might also impact groundwater soluble p concentrations the large discrepancy between the model grid scale 250 m and the observation scale could also be one of the reasons for the poor match overall however the correct magnitudes and ranges are simulated the purpose of this study is to demonstrate the capability of the model to reproduce general spatial and temporal trends and distributions of groundwater no3 n and soluble p concentrations fig 8 shows frequency distribution plots for no3 n and p for all simulated and observed groundwater concentration values the average of the measured values in the observation wells 4 83 mg l 1 for no3 n and 0 13 mg l 1 for soluble p compares well to the annual averaged simulated values from all grid cells 4 91 mg l 1 for no3 n and 0 12 mg l 1 for soluble p according to the figure the general shape and magnitude of frequency for each concentration interval is similar to the frequency from the observed data especially for no3 n soluble p concentration is overestimated for the low range 0 1 mg l 1 and underestimated for the mid range 0 1 0 25 mg l 1 this is due in part to majority of monitoring wells being located in stream corridor areas which exhibit high p concentrations whereas the model results are taken from the entire model domain 3 3 3 groundwater nutrient mass loading to surface water annual averaged spatial distribution of simulated mass loading of no3 n and soluble p to the river system along the arkansas river and the tributaries during the 1999 2016 period are shown in fig 9 values are plotted for 731 river cells within the study region blue bars indicate mass loading from the stream to the aquifer whereas green yellow red bars represent mass loading from the aquifer to the river network it shows that the vast majority of nutrient loading happens from the aquifer into the river i e positive values with averaged no3 n mass ranging from 97 kg m to 907 kg m and solute p mass ranging from 5 4 kg m to 36 8 kg m in this study region the nutrient mass loading is highly spatial variable due to different local hydrological conditions and groundwater nutrient concentrations for the entire study area the 18 years average daily loading is 17 4 kg for no3 n and 0 34 kg for soluble p the individual subbasin loading has tremendous variability ranging from 8 3 kg to 196 3 kg and 0 2 kg to 4 8 kg for no3 n fig 7c and soluble p fig 7d respectively thus the figures provide important information regarding spatial patterns in loading rates indicating which subbasins provide the most nutrient mass the highlighted subbasins in fig 7c and d are the top 6 regions that respectively contains 50 and 60 of total mass loading of no3 n and soluble p from the aquifer to the streams these severe areas 15 of the watershed area could be targeted for bmp application 3 3 4 crop yield in colorado crop yield is an important factor to help evaluate water productivity dozier et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b annual comparison between observed and simulated corn yield and alfalfa yield is presented in fig 10 due to the data availability from nass results during 2001 to 2006 are compared black boxes and grey boxes represent simulated corn and alfalfa yields under the baseline scenario respectively while purple dash line and orange dash lines represent observed corn and alfalfa values based on results the coupled model was able to predict variations in crop yield with annual average yield of 9 7 tons ha 1 for corn and 7 3 tons ha 1 for alfalfa 4 quantifying the effect of bmps on no3 and p this section describes the method of implementing bmps and analysis of the results analysis is performed in terms of the ability of a given bmp to decrease no3 n and soluble p in stream concentrations groundwater concentrations solute mass loadings from groundwater to the surface river systems and solute mass loading from individual subbasins results are compared with baseline model results described in section 3 3 following an analysis of domain wide bmp implementation results of spatial bmp targeting also will be presented 4 1 description of bmp simulations the tested bmps in this study are related to irrigation management nutrient management water conveyance efficiency and tillage operations a total of 28 bmp scenarios were evaluated table 5 with an additional 20 combination bmps irrigation management consists of using optimum irrigation practices for example by replacing the traditional flood irrigation to more efficient drip sprinkler irrigation this improved efficiency can be achieved by adjusting irrigation efficiency irr eff and surface runoff ratio irr asq through auto irrigation operations in the swat management files for irrigation reduction ir scenarios irr asq were decreased by 10 and 30 and irr eff were increased by 10 and 30 ir10 and ir30 respectively so that the reduction of irrigation water would lower surface runoff and soil percolation which result in net reductions of solute transportation and mass loading into stream systems nutrient management to reduce the availability of excess nutrients is simulated by controlling the applied fertilizer amount frt kg in the swat management files two different fertilization reduction fr scenarios were developed by reducing the fertilizer amount by 10 fr10 and 30 fr30 these levels of reduction are judged reasonable to avoid appreciable crop yield decrease analysis of the impact on crop yield will be discussed with results seepage loss from earthen irrigation canals in the larv varies from 0 012 m3 s 1 km 1 to 0 04 m3 s 1 km 1 susfalk et al 2008 and provides a considerable source of recharge to shallow groundwater in this study seepage reductions sr were specified to 40 sr40 and 60 sr60 which can be achieved by lowering the river bed conductance in the modflow river package morway et al 2013 in the larv seepage reduction is possible through canal lining and sealing which has been tested by martin and gates 2014 by using linear anionic polyacrylamide to decease seepage losses the higher percent of seepage reduction indicates a higher level of labor and material investment land use management scenarios involving conservation tillage ct and no tillage nt operations were developed in typical field conditions tillage operations are carried out with conventional tillage including disk plow and moldboard plow these two practices increase the amount of residue on the surface between the period of harvest and planting the next crop tuppad et al 2010 conservation tillage leaves at least 30 of the soil surface covered with crop residue while no tillage is carried out by planting crop in the soil without any tillage operation in swat these tillage operations differ in terms of the mixing efficiency effmix and depth of mixing deptil which specify the fraction of residue on surface that are mixed uniformly through the soil depth specific values for each parameter are listed in table 5 scenarios 1 8 include individual bmps application with each bmp analyzed over a conservative and an aggressive level scenarios 9 12 13 24 and 25 28 represent the adoption of 2 3 and 4 concurrent bmps respectively due to the uncertainty associated with the land use management tillage operations were considered as a single bmp with no respective level assigned to it in order to limit the total number of bmp combinations associated with the computational time only bmps with the same respective levels of implementation i e irrigation management nutrient management and water conveyance efficiency were combined for 3 bmps and 4 bmps in this study the impact of bmp implementation on water quality is presented as percent reductions from the calibrated baseline swat modflow rt3d model for the same period 1999 2016 each bmp was simulated individually with all inputs except the parameters used to represent a bmp kept constant of the calibrated value the percent reduction was calculated as follows 6 reduction i 1 n prebm p i p o s t b m p i prebm p i 100 n where prebmp and postbmp are model outputs for month i before and after implementation of bmp respectively n is the total months during the simulated period a positive value indicates that the bmp reduced the outputs compared to the baseline condition whereas a negative value indicates that the bmp results in increased outcomes 4 2 bmp results 4 2 1 changes in nutrient groundwater concentrations average percent reduction of no3 n and soluble p concentration in groundwater for each of the bmp scenarios throughout the 18 yr simulation period is summarized in fig 11 the average nutrient reduction rates were computed using the simulation values in the second layer of the model which is the depth that monitoring wells located at for each bmp set the impact on reducing groundwater concentrations increases with the increasing level of implementation for individual bmps fr10 and sr40 under scenarios with conservative level of implementation were found to be effective at decreasing no3 n groundwater concentration by 4 and 3 respectively and decreasing soluble p by 0 9 and 0 5 respectively ir30 and fr30 scenarios under the aggressive level were more efficient to decrease the amount of nutrient leaching into the aquifer system with no3 n concentration reduced by 12 20 respectively and soluble p reduced by 1 and 2 respectively the conservation ir10 scenarios yielded a negligible decrease with 0 3 rate for no3 n and 0 1 for soluble p as a reminder irrigation reduction scenario is essentially increasing the irrigation efficiency rate 10 of increase in irrigation efficiency could likely result in several issues including lower the water content and increase the leaching time bailey et al 2015 in addition it is interesting to note that compared with the nt scenario the ct scenario resulted in a better reduction in groundwater nutrient concentrations which is because of soil evaporation increased by the conservation tillage resulted in the decrease of soil water content thus reduced infiltration simulated by ct scenario which led to less nutrient leaching into the aquifer system when comparing fig 11a and b it can be seen that all the bmp scenarios are more efficient to reduce the no3 n concentrations that the average percent reduction for no3 n was 15 with the highest rate of 41 whereas for soluble p the average percent was only 3 with the highest rate of 7 6 this is because the majority of soluble p was attached to soil surface when leaching through the soil profile the cell wise spatial reduction are illustrated in fig 12 a c for the selected combined 4 bmp of ir30 fr30 sr60 cf scenario 4 bmp scenario the highest reduction scenario it shows the difference of nutrient groundwater concentrations between the baseline scenarios shown in figs 6a and 7a and the simulated bmp scenarios for no3 n and soluble p respectively decreases in concentrations are represented by blue green yellow colors while increases in concentrations are showed in orange red colors the contour plots exhibit a large spatial variability of lowing the concentrations by this bmp with an average concentration decrease in no3 n and soluble p of 1 81 mg l 1 and 0 005 mg l 1 respectively many locations show a substantial decrease up to 18 mg l 1 for no3 n and 0 29 for soluble p as shown also in the histograms of fig 12b d uniform 4 bmps for no3 n 81 of the cells have a decrease greater than 20 and 54 of the cells have a decrease greater than 50 for soluble p 31 of cells have a decrease greater than 10 4 2 2 changes in nutrient mass loading to surface water simulated reductions in no3 n and soluble p mass loading into the arkansas river and its tributaries from aquifer system are summarized in fig 13 a among the individual bmp scenarios the seepage reduction scenarios were quite efficient in decreasing nutrient loadings from groundwater into the streams the reduction rate for the aggressive sr60 scenario is 39 for no3 n and 34 for soluble p while for the conservative sr40 scenario the rate is 14 for no3 n and 16 for soluble p respectively seepage reductions could result in a decrease in recharge from deep percolation to the groundwater system therefore lower water tables due to the decreased seepage rate could lead to a reduction in return flow and further decrease the nutrient mass loadings into rivers the most effective type of combined bmp occurred to be the ir30 fr30 ct sr60 scenario 4 bmp scenario with the reduction of 63 for no3 n and 49 for soluble p respectively under this scenario reductions in mass loading were achieved simultaneously by changing the recharge rate return flow rate and the nutrient concentrations in the return flow since ir10 and nt scenarios did not sufficiently affect groundwater concentrations fig 11 their influences on mass loading were negligible selected temporal variability of simulated reductions in nutrient mass loadings from aquifer to the rivers are shown for scenarios ir30 sr60 fr10 sr40 nt and ir30 fr30 ct sr60 in fig 13b c as can be seen from these figures the combined 4 bmp had the strongest impact on decreasing no3 n and soluble p concentrations followed by the 3 bmp scenario for the implementations of ir30 and sr60 the saved water could increase the stream stage thus result in the reductions of return flow and nutrient mass loading among the individual scenarios sr60 had the highest impact on nutrients control by lowing the recharge rate and water table to mitigate non beneficial consumptive use however it could lead to an increase of salinity in root zone if salt leaching is not adequate this tradeoff will need to be further estimated using a calibrated salt transport model like the one developed by bailey et al 2019 fig 14 summarized the removal efficiency of nutrient mass loadings from aquifer into each subbasin for the selected bmps as shown in the figure the 4 bmp scenario is the most efficient one with the average reduction rate of 34 for no3 n and 17 soluble p respectively the subbasin loading plots displays substantial spatial variability in the effectiveness of lowering mass loading 4 2 3 changes in nutrient in stream concentrations to the river system the overall average percent reductions in no3 n and soluble p in stream concentration at the outlet of the study region are summarized for each of the 28 bmps in fig 15 a fig 15a shows that ir10 has negative effect on reducing no3 n and soluble p in stream concentrations and result in a slightly increase of the concentrations at the outlet this is likely due to the increase of irrigation efficiency not being enough to compensate for the decrease of runoff ratio so that the same amount of fertilizer being applied to field cannot be diluted by the surface runoff leading to a higher nutrient concentration in surface water it has been demonstrated by ir10 fr10 scenario that in stream concentrations can be reduced by 14 and 9 for no3 n and soluble p respectively with a 10 fertilizer reduction added on the 10 irrigation reduction implementation at the aggressive level the fr30 is found to be the most effective individual bmp for lowing no3 n 25 and soluble p 10 followed by sr60 17 for no3 n and 8 for soluble p and ct 14 no3 n 5 for soluble p 4 bmp scenario again is the most effective type of combined bmp resulting in an average reduction of 52 and 40 respectively the influence of the nt scenario was negligible for in stream no3 n 0 14 and soluble p concentration 2 ct implementation turned out to have higher impact with the simulated percent reductions in 14 for no3 n and 5 for soluble p respectively this result is due to ct implementation mixing the residues properly in the top soil the build up of residues for nt implementation were easily loaded to the stream with surface runoff resulting in a higher nutrient concentration in the surface water on the other hand the low impact of nt implementation on nutrient mass loading into river fig 13a also affects the nutrient concentrations in surface water since this study region is a groundwater dominant region however if nt implementation is combined with the other bmps the reduction rates can be increased to 48 and 35 for no3 n and soluble p respectively fr30 sr60 nt scenario time series no3 n and soluble p concentrations simulated over both arkansas river and the tributaries were shown in fig 15b and c respectively the median concentrations were plotted under baseline scenario and the selected conservative and aggressive bmps to show the reduction more clearly these figures were plotted between 2006 and 2016 the conservative bmps include ir10 fr10 scenario and ir10 sr40 ct scenario while the aggressive bmps include fr30 scenario and ir30 fr30 sr60 ct scenario as can be seen from the figures all the scenarios showed a continuous reduction over the simulation period with the most impressive reduction generated by the ir30 fr30 sr60 ct scenario that the entire simulated no3 n and soluble p median concentrations were predicted under the colorado standard grey dash line in fig 15b and c the plot also revealed a slightly trend that the impact of bmps were increasing gradually over the simulation period due to the very slow movement of flow and nutrients in groundwater therefore conservative bmps could also work to achieve the colorado standard for a longer time period 4 2 4 changes for spatially targeted bmps in general the ir30 fr30 ct sr60 scenario is predicted to have the greatest overall impact to the nutrient reduction while fr30 scenario is the most effective singular bmp the impact of ir30 fr30 ct sr60 scenario on the crop productions is presented in fig 10 the average reduction in crop yield are 22 and 4 for corn red boxes and alfalfa green boxes respectively in the case of alfalfa the lower impact is due to it is a perennial legume fixing nitrogen from the air n fertilizers are generally only needed for early stage of its establishment davis et al 2005 in addition fr30 scenario resulted in a 36 corn reduction for the entire region mainly due to the sensitivity of fluctuations in fertilizer that stress the corn plant for the economic sustainability of irrigated agriculture it is important to consider the impact of the bmp scenarios on farmer s profits and realize that nutrient management strategies might decrease crop yield therefore a localized targeting scheme for fertilizer reduction likely is more realistic wherein nutrient management is implemented for certain field sets or subbasins within the larger watershed area to this end an additional simulation was run in which the most efficient bmp combination 4 bmps were applied only to 6 targeted subbasins shown in fig 9 fig 16 shows the predicted no3 n a b and soluble p c d median concentrations from the arkansas river and its tributaries of baseline scenarios fr30 scenarios and 4 bmps scenarios fig 16 reveals that the targeted bmps also have impact on reducing in stream concentrations but not as substantial as the reduction that uniformly applied to the entire region since the plots also reveal a trend of increasing impact over time it will take longer for targeted applied bmps to achieve their full effect groundwater cell wise reduction based on the targeted 4 bmp scenario is presented in fig 12b d with red boxes represent no3 n and green boxes represent soluble p respectively it indicates similar results with in stream concentrations reduction that the targeted applied bmps is decreasing the nutrients concentrations however their effectiveness is less than the uniformly applied bmps regarding the corn production the impact of the targeted 4 bmp scenario and targeted fr30 scenario lead to a 20 and 13 reduction rate 2 and 9 better than the uniformly 4 bmp scenario overall crop production and nutrient reduction are strongly impacted by the region of investigated implementation when applying bmps only in 6 targeted subbasins many areas of the study region can have a significant decrease in no3 n and soluble p therefore the most potential cost effective approach is to control nutrient loading from the major source areas and regional impact can be achieved by focusing bmps on localized areas there is not one set of universal bmps the effectiveness of bmps varies among studies indicating that the most effective bmps likely depend on specific circumstances of individual watersheds however the modelling results of the need for combined implementation of bmps and strategic targeting of locations can help policy makers to effectively design programs to maintain cost in compensating the farmers for their yield loss 5 summary and conclusions this paper presents a physically based spatially distributed model that simulates no3 and soluble p fate and transport in a coupled stream aquifer system and applies the model to investigate the impact of water and land management bmps on no3 and p in this system the swat modflow rt3d model wei et al 2018a was modified to include soluble p groundwater transport and accounts for the major processes that govern no3 n and soluble p movement transformation and storage in intensively managed irrigated stream aquifer systems including application of irrigation water from surface canals and pumping wells crop growth and rotation seepage of canal water infiltration and percolation of irrigation water loading of n and p fertilizer sorption denitrification and groundwater surface water interactions due to the elevated nutrient concentrations in the irrigation system the cycling of n and p mass in irrigation water was also included in the modelling code the model was tested in a 732 km2 irrigated stream aquifer system in the lower arkansas river valley colorado during the 1999 2016 time period with model output compared to observed groundwater concentration in stream loading in stream concentration and crop yield for both no3 and p the tested model was used to evaluate the potential impact of water and land bmps to decrease no3 n and soluble p concentrations in the groundwater mass loading to river and stream concentrations relative to baseline conditions for individual bmps ir30 with 12 reduction rate and fr30 with 20 reduction rate are showed to be efficient to lower concentrations in groundwater water conveyance efficiency i e seepage reductions are simulated to be efficient to decrease soluble mass loading into river with reduction rate of 39 and 34 for no3 n and soluble p respectively conservative irrigation management ir10 and no tillage are not as impactful as other bmps results also demonstrate that fr30 is the most effective individual bmp for lowing in stream concentrations of no3 n 25 and soluble p 9 benefit of bmps in combination with one another is also revealed by this study among all the combined bmps the ir30 fr30 ct sr60 scenario appears to be have the most significant reduction for both no3 n and soluble p contamination however efficient corn productivity cannot be achieved by the combination implementation therefore a targeted approach in which bmps were applied to only 15 of the watershed area was tested and is recommend to remediate water quality while maintaining crop yield 6 code availability swat modflow rt3d is available at https swat tamu edu software swat modflow source code tutorial and

4560,in irrigated semi arid watersheds over fertilization often leads to nitrogen n and phosphorus p contamination in aquifers and river systems modelling tools often are used to evaluate the effect of management practices on nutrient contamination levels in this study we assess a suite of best management practices bmps for n and p in a regional irrigated stream aquifer system using a new numerical model as it is necessary to consider the interaction of flow in the stream and aquifer swat modflow model that couples surface and groundwater flow was used the reactive processes were modelled using rt3d that simulate the reactive groundwater transport the model is based on the coupled flow model swat modflow with the groundwater reactive transport model rt3d included to simulate the reactive groundwater transport of no3 and soluble p and their interactions within the soil aquifer stream system the assessment is performed for a highly managed 732 km2 region in the lower arkansas river valley south eastern colorado with model results compared to observed groundwater nutrient concentration in stream nutrient concentration and loading and crop yield a total of 28 bmps scenarios are evaluated regarding their impact on no3 and soluble p contamination in the aquifer and river system the most effective individual bmp in most areas is to decrease fertilizer by 30 resulting in no3 and soluble p reduced by 20 and 2 for groundwater concentrations 25 and 10 for river concentrations and 27 and 6 for mass loadings into surface water respectively combinations of using 30 irrigation reduction 30 fertilization reduction 60 canal seepage reduction and conservation tillage yield the greatest overall impact to lower no3 and soluble p concentrations up to 41 and 8 in groundwater 52 and 40 in river and 63 and 49 for mass loadings targeting bmps on localized problem areas shows great promise in reducing contamination while maintaining region wide crop yield the study demonstrates the swat modflow rt3d modelling code is a useful tool to examine no3 and p transport and quantify bmp effects in groundwater driven watersheds keywords nitrate phosphorus swat modflow rt3d surface and groundwater solute transport modelling intensively irrigated system bmp 1 introduction nitrogen n and phosphorus p are essential elements for plant growth but their application in agricultural areas has resulted in a serious environmental issues for both surface water and groundwater monaghan et al 2005 dechmi and skhiri 2013 cerro et al 2014 between 1964 and 1999 irrigation activities and food production doubled resulting in a 7 fold increase in the use of n based fertilizer and a 3 fold increase in p based fertilizer huizenga et al 2017 the enrichment of n and p in agricultural systems has resulted in eutrophication of lakes and rivers a major environmental concern throughout the world omernik et al 1981 smith 2003 volk et al 2009 e g more than half of all surface water bodies in europe are impaired by nutrient pollution poikane et al 2019 however established nutrient standards of n and p vary by water type and by environmental agency in europe established threshold concentrations of n range between 0 25 and 35 mg l for lakes reservoirs and 0 25 4 0 mg l for streams rivers whereas in the usa the state prepared thresholds range from 0 1 to 4 0 mg l for lakes reservoirs and 0 1 10 mg l for streams rivers poikane et al 2019 usepa 2019 for p threshold concentrations range from 5 to 500 µg l for lakes reservoirs and from 5 to 2500 µg l for streams rivers poikane et al 2019 usepa 2019 no3 and soluble p can be transported to streams via surface runoff soil lateral flow and groundwater discharge dupas et al 2015 constantino et al 2017 gurung et al 2021 no3 is highly mobile in soil water and groundwater with minimal sorption when fertilizer application exceeds the crop demand and denitrification capacity of the soil no3 can dissolve and leach into the underlying alluvial aquifer and then load to streams via groundwater discharge du et al 2016 zhang 2016 zimnicki et al 2020 p is usually considered to be highly immobile with significant sorption to soil colloids or organic matter in topsoil or the shallow subsurface leading to high p concentration in surface runoff during irrigation events or rainfall events kovacs et al 2008 however soluble p can leach to the water table and be transported to streams sharpley 1995 for many irrigated agricultural systems reactive transport of no3 and soluble p in the aquifer system has a strong influence on the storage of n and p and greatly affects the timing and amount of n and p mass loading to surface water wei et al 2018a understanding and accounting for nutrient storage and transport is essential for assessing baseline conditions in watersheds and identifying effective nutrient management strategies particularly for highly managed agricultural watersheds where complex hydrologic pathways can occur between surface water and groundwater numerous methods have been proposed to identify best management practices bmps for nutrient management bmps include efficient use of irrigation water abdelraouf and ragab 2018 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 decreasing fertilizer loading almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 schilling and wolter 2009 enhancing soil covers gaynor and findlay 1995 bosch et al 2013 almendinger and ulrich 2017 and associated combinations novotny 2002 rong and xuefeng 2011 zhang et al 2013 dozier et al 2017 chukalla et al 2018 robertson et al 2018 deng and bailey 2020 often the effect of proposed bmps on n and p concentrations and loadings is evaluated using computational modelling tools the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 a watershed model that simulates water and nutrient transport via surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow and streamflow using water and nutrient balances on a daily time step is the most commonly used model to assess nutrient bmps with hundreds of studies published since the year 2000 e g secchi et al 2007 tuppad et al 2010 waidler et al 2011 özcan et al 2017 bailey et al 2019 zimnicki et al 2020 with many studies focusing solely on p santhi et al 2006 dechmi and skhiri 2013 rousseau et al 2013 lamba et al 2016 taylor et al 2016 malagó et al 2017 other modelling tools include simplifications of swat for field scale nutrient export white et al 2010 or simple models that link source areas to water bodies using digital elevation models and travel time indices buchanan et al 2013 kovacs et al 2008 a second group of models use physical based spatially distributed groundwater flow and solute transport models such as the groundwater flow model modflow harbaugh 2005 and the groundwater solute transport models mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 or rt3d clement 1997 or their derivatives conan et al 2003 wriedt and rode 2006 almasri and kaluarachchi 2007 bailey et al 2013 however these modelling approaches have focused typically only on n contamination while each model type works well for selected watersheds major components of n and p transport in watershed systems are either treated simplistically or are not included swat simulates both n and p transport but its simplified representation of groundwater flow processes and groundwater surface water interaction often results in poor performance in watershed systems wherein groundwater discharge is a significant component of stream flow chu and shirmohammadi 2004 gassman et al 2007 as a result accurate timing and amount of water and nutrient loading from the aquifer to the stream cannot be produced conversely aquifer focused models such as mt3dms and rt3d neglect soil and land surface hydrologic pathways such as surface runoff and lateral flow and do not include the transport of p species wei et al 2018a included no3 transport to swat modflow bailey et al 2016 which includes pbsd groundwater flow but was not applied to bmps and did not include p transport to our knowledge no study has developed a comprehensive tool for assessing the effectiveness of bmps to reduce both n and p in a highly managed stream aquifer system the objective of this paper is two fold 1 present a version of swat modflow rt3d that simulates fate and transport of both no3 and soluble p in agricultural watersheds and 2 use the model to evaluate the effect of a suite of bmps on no3 and soluble p storage and contamination in an intensively irrigated stream aquifer system for the latter nutrient concentration and loading will be assessed for both the aquifer and the river system the model is applied to a 732 km2 region of the lower arkansas river valley larv in southeastern colorado and builds on the work of bailey et al 2015 who assessed bmp impact on groundwater no3 concentrations and loading and shultz et al 2018 who assessed bmp impact on no3 concentrations in the coupled groundwater surface water system however these latter studies did not include land surface hydrology the remainder of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents a description of swat modflow rt3d and the coupled swat modflow rt3d model including n and p cycling and transport modification section 3 presents the application of the model to baseline conditions in the larv study region section 4 outlines proposed bmps and a presentation of modelling results and an overall ranking of bmps section 5 provides a summary and conclusions 2 swat modflow rt3d for n and p transport this section first introduces the swat and modflow models followed by the previous version of swat modflow rt3d for no3 transport wei et al 2018a and then modifications to swat modflow rt3d to simulate combined no3 and p transport and include nutrient mass in irrigation water fig 1 shows the n and p processes simulated in the new version of swat modflow rt3d which will be explained in detail in section 2 5 2 1 swat model for n and p transport the swat model is a physically based spatially semi distributed watershed model arnold et al 1998 that computes water and nutrient mass balances on a daily time step the model has been widely used to evaluate the impact of different agricultural conservation practices in large complex watersheds under varying management conditions arabi et al 2007 dechmi and skhiri 2013 marek et al 2017 ahn et al 2018 wei et al 2018b in swat the watershed is divided into subbasins based on the river network and user defined threshold drainage area each subbasin is further divided into hydrologic response units hrus with homogeneous land use slope and soil characteristics the hru is the smallest landscape component of swat with output water fluxes and nutrient fluxes from each hru within a subbasin summed and loaded to the subbasin channel and the resulting flow and loads are routed through channels to the watershed outlet the model integrates all relevant eco hydrologic processes including weather surface flow soil erosion subsurface flow infiltration percolation evapotranspiration et crop growth and irrigation land use management and nutrient transport through watersheds the swat model simulates n and p transformation through several forms between organic and inorganic pools in the nutrient cycle within the root zone tuppad et al 2010 nutrients are introduced into the system through atmospheric fixation plant residue and fertilization while nutrient loss from soil includes surface runoff plant uptake leaching lateral subsurface flow and groundwater flow swat in stream nutrient dynamics are simulated using qual2e kinetic routines brown and barnwell 1987 arnold et al 2013 and in stream transport algorithms 2 2 modflow model the groundwater flow model modflow harbaugh 2005 is a physically based fully distributed model that solves the three dimensional groundwater flow equation using the finite difference method the aquifer domain is discretized laterally and vertically into grid cells with a water balance equation written for each grid cell at each time step sources and sinks can include recharge groundwater et pumping and groundwater surface water exchange aquifer properties specific yield specific storage hydraulic conductivity also are specified for each grid cell the system of equations with one equation for each grid cell is solved for groundwater head at each model time step a new version of modflow modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 is well suited for highly nonlinear problems results simulated by modflow i e groundwater head groundwater flow rates sources sinks rates can be used by groundwater solute transport models such as pht3d prommer et al 2003 laattoe et al 2017 mt3dms pulido velazquez et al 2015 ehtiat et al 2018 and rt3d clement 1997 bailey et al 2014 among these rt3d solves multi species chemical reactions simultaneously using an ordinary differential equation ode solver thus allowing for the concentration of multiple chemical species to be updated simultaneously therefore it allows the concentration of a solute to influence the reaction rates of other chemical species 2 3 swat modflow model several studies have presented a linked modelling system between swat and modflow sophocleous and perkins 2000 kim et al 2008 bailey et al 2016 the most recent version bailey et al 2016 imbeds the modflow subroutines within the swat modelling code with swat calling modflow during each daily time step recharge and unsatisfied potential et from each hru are passed to modflow grid cells via mapping routines and groundwater head and groundwater surface water exchange rates are passed from modflow grid cells to swat hrus and swat subbasin channels respectively swat routines then route water through the subbasin channels to the watershed outlet therefore swat simulates surface runoff and soil lateral flow to subbasin channels whereas modflow simulates groundwater discharge to subbasin channels within this framework modflow also simulates river seepage to the aquifer if the water table adjacent to a stream is below the stream stage this version of swat modflow has been used worldwide in recent years aliyari et al 2019 chunn et al 2019 gao et al 2019 liu et al 2019 molina navarro et al 2019 taie semiromi and koch 2019 wei and bailey 2019 to assess watershed water resources and quantify the impact of pumping and climate change on streamflow and groundwater levels 2 4 rt3d model the numerical code reactive transport in 3 dimensions rt3d simulates the groundwater reactive transport of one or more solutes by solving the advection dispersion reactive adr mass balance equation clement 1997 clement et al 1998 rt3d uses the same finite difference grid as the modflow mode which provides cell by cell groundwater hydraulic head 3d flux rates and groundwater sources and sinks e g recharge pumping the adr equations for a set of solutes in saturated porous media are written as 1 c k t r k x i v i c k x i d ij c k x j q s ϕ c s k r k k 1 2 m where m is the total number of aqueous phase species ck mflf 3 is the solute concentration of the k th species in aqueous phase xi j l is the distance along the respective cartesian coordinate axis dij l2t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient which can be assumed to be independent of solute concentration v lbt 1 is the average groundwater velocity where b denotes the bulk phase ϕ lf 3lb 3 is soil porosity qs lf 3t 1lb 3 is the volumetric flux of water representing sources and sinks of the species c s k mflf 3 is the concentration of the source or sink rk mflf 3t 1 represents the rate of all reactions that occur in the aqueous phase for the k th species and rk is the retardation coefficient for the kth species representing linear sorption with aquifer sediment surface sites therefore the change of solute concentration through time is represented by the four terms on the right hand side of eq 1 advection dispersion sources and sinks mixing and kinetic chemical reactions 2 5 swat modflow rt3d 2 5 1 previous version nitrogen transport the study of wei et al 2018a included rt3d into the swat modflow bailey et al 2016 modelling framework for comprehensive transport of no3 in a watershed setting i e surface runoff soil lateral flow spatially distributed groundwater flow the rt3d model subroutines are imbedded into the modflow routines with rt3d called each daily time step modflow passes groundwater head groundwater flux rates and groundwater sources sink rates to the rt3d grid cells which then solves for no3 groundwater concentration at each grid cell and groundwater no3 loadings to streams with the latter passed to swat subbasin channels for in stream no3 loading through the watershed stream network the model was applied to the upper klamath basin in southern oregon with model output tested against in stream no3 loadings and groundwater no3 concentration wei et al 2018a the following adr equation was used for no3 groundwater transport 2 c n o 3 t r n o 3 x i v i c n o 3 x i d ij c n o 3 x j q s ϕ c s n o 3 r n o 3 with the rate law for denitrification defined using a single monod expression 3 r no 3 μ n o 3 c n o 3 c n o 3 k n o 3 c n o 3 where μ n o 3 is the first order rate constant d 1 for denitrification and k n o 3 is the monod half saturation constant mflf 3 for no3 since no3 does not sorb r n o 3 in equation 2 is set to 1 for all grid cells 2 5 2 model modifications 2 5 2 1 p transport for this study the swat modflow rt3d modelling code of wei et al 2018a was amended to include transport of soluble p in the aquifer and p mass loading exchange between the aquifer and the stream network the cycling and transport of n and p species in the land surface soil aquifer system as simulated by swat modflow rt3d is shown in fig 1 within this system nutrient mass enters the subsurface via atmospheric fixation and fertilizer loading within the soil zone organic p can be mineralized to soluble p which then can be attached to mineral surfaces via sorption organic n can undergo ammonification to ammonium nh4 which can be changed to nitrate no3 through nitrification and then denitrified to nitrogen gas n2 no3 nh4 and soluble p can be either taken up by crop roots and be removed from the system through harvest processes or loaded back to the stream network through lateral flow in the soil zone meanwhile those species can leach downward to the water table through deep percolation where they undergo 3d transport in the saturated zone and can be loaded back to the stream via groundwater discharge no3 and p mass can also be transferred from the aquifer to the land surface via groundwater pumping for irrigation in addition to the adr equation for no3 equation 2 the following adr is included for soluble p transport in the groundwater system 4 c p o 4 t r p o 4 x i v i c p o 4 x i d ij c p o 4 x j q s ϕ c s p o 4 r p o 4 unlike no3 soluble p sorbs strongly to soil and aquifer sediments and hence r p o 4 is 1 as soluble p has no appreciable reduction rate in groundwater system r p o 4 is set to 0 although this study simulates only no3 and p transport in the aquifer other reactive solutes could be implemented into the rt3d reaction module depending on the watershed system 2 5 2 2 n and p mass in irrigation water another modification to the swat modflow rt3d code for this study is the inclusion of no3 and p mass in irrigation water for many watersheds the high concentration of no3 and p in river water and groundwater can add appreciable amounts of solute mass to the land surface during irrigation events in particular if pumped groundwater is used for irrigation irrigation water chemistry can be changed significantly due to the typically much higher concentration of nutrients in groundwater than in surface water mcmahon and böhlke 1996 however the original swat modelling code does not account for nutrient mass in irrigation water in this study the swat modelling code was modified to account for the loading of no3 and soluble p mass to the soil profile via irrigation water from both surface water canal diversions and groundwater pumping if the irrigation water source is a subbasin reach surface water irrigation the concentration mg l of no3 and soluble p in the reach water is used to calculate nutrient mass kg ha 1 that is added to the first soil layer of the corresponding hru where irrigation is applied with the applied nutrient mass removed from the source of the corresponding reach if the irrigation water is provided by the shallow aquifer pumping the nutrient mass kg ha 1 of no3 and p each species is added to the first soil layer of the corresponding hru and then subtracted from the corresponding rt3d grid cell for both sources the nutrient mass in the irrigation water kg ha 1 is calculated as the product of concentration in the irrigation water and the volume of applied irrigation water divided by the hru area 3 swat modflow rt3d application to irrigated stream aquifer systems 3 1 description of study region the lower arkansas river valley larv in southeastern colorado has a long history of rich agricultural production and currently faces challenging issues due to extremely shallow water tables resulting from more than 100 years intensive irrigation seepage from earthen canals and inefficient drainage systems mcmahon and böhlke 1996 gates et al 2012 bailey et al 2012 the study area is a semi arid region located within the larv in southeastern colorado fig 2 a with average annual precipitation of 273 mm the average temperature is 13 6 c with the monthly temperatures ranging from 12 6 c in january to 35 9 c in july it encompasses a total of 732 km2 of which about 330 km2 is agricultural fields with intensive cultivation major crops in order of planted area are alfalfa followed by sorghum corn grass pasture sunflower melons oats onion and soybeans see fig 2b the growing season commences mid to late march and ends in early november with earthen irrigation canals receiving water from the arkansas river during the period of march 15th to november 15th the vast majority of irrigation water is derived from one of six principal irrigation canals rocky ford highline catlin otero rocky ford ditch fort lyon and holbrook with supplemental irrigation water provided by approximately 500 groundwater pumping wells fig 2a over fertilization on cultivated fields has resulted in high surface and groundwater no3 concentrations assessed by numerous monitoring data stream sample sites groundwater observation wells in the study region a first set of field data was collected and analyzed for no3 n between june 2006 and july 2011 with a total of 270 surface water samples and 598 groundwater samples taken from 20 surface sites and 80 monitoring wells fig 2c during 18 sampling events a second set of field data was gathered between june 2014 and february 2016 with both concentrations of no3 n and soluble p sampled at the same surface sites a total of 71 samples and 25 observation wells a total of 193 samples from both data sets the average no3 n and soluble p concentration in surface water is 1 83 mg l 1 and 0 16 mg l 1 respectively compared to the colorado interim nutrient standard of 2 01 mg l 1 and 0 17 mg l 1 for total n and total p 34 and 30 of samples exceeded the standard for no3 and soluble p respectively for groundwater average monitored concentrations for no3 n and soluble p is 4 83 mg l 1 and 0 13 mg l 1 with maximum values of 66 mg l 1 and 1 1 mg l 1 respectively more details of observed data will be presented with model results in section 3 4 3 2 swat modflow rt3d model set up for the larv a previously calibrated and tested swat modflow model for the larv study region is used to link with rt3d to simulate nutrient fate and transport in the study region the swat modflow is detailed in wei and bailey 2019 constructed by linking a calibrated swat model wei et al 2018b that accounts for canal seepage and crop rotations with a calibrated modflow model morway et al 2013 for the study area the model includes new subroutines for groundwater irrigation and groundwater evapotranspiration and provides a detailed description of surface and groundwater flow processes thereby enabling a specific description of watershed processes including streamflow et surface runoff soil later flow infiltration recharge 3d groundwater flow in a heterogeneous aquifer system with various sources and sinks groundwater et and spatio temporal groundwater and surface water interactions the spatial extent of the swat modflow model which is used in this study for swat modflow rt3d is shown in fig 2c the model domain contains 5270 hrus and 72 subbasins with each cultivated field designated as an individual hru complete description of designating each cultivated field as an hru is provided in wei et al 2018b thus management operations such as irrigation application plant growth fertilizer application harvest and kill and tillage operation can be applied to each hru to mimic real world conditions specific management operations for each crop type is listed in table 1 with the values provided via expert opinion from research scientists at the arkansas valley research center avrc located within the study region michael bartolot personal communication the management input file mgt for hrus accommodates crop rotation in continuous years an example of the management file with corn and alfalfa rotation is provided in table 2 in the study area approximately 88 irrigation water is provided by surface water through canals and 12 is provided by groundwater through pumping wells the auto irrigation algorithms in swat were used to trigger irrigation events based on plant water demand for both surface water and groundwater irrigation the value of 0 9 recommended by arnold et al 2012 for auto irrigation threshold in our model is used which means if the crop growth falls below 90 of its optimal value irrigation will be applied the modflow finite difference grid contains 7777 active cells horizontally see fig 2c with a uniform cell size of 250 m 250 m the aquifer is discretized vertically into 3 layers 2 for the alluvial aquifer and one for the shale bedrock which is on average 15 m below ground surface canal seepage from each of the six earthen canals is simulated using modflow s river package with the corresponding canal diverted flows specified as point sinks in swat for groundwater irrigation daily pumping rates are specified in modflow s well package with the volume converted to depths and applied to swat hrus wei and bailey 2019 based on a spatial relationship between the pumping wells and the irrigated hrus example output of stream discharge at the watershed outlet near las animas colorado water table depth and recharge rates from the calibrated swat modflow model are shown in fig 3 as can be seen from the figure the shallowest water table occurs along the river corridors of the arkansas river and the tributaries with the deepest water table occurring away from the river network based on the evaluation criteria defined by moriasi et al 2015 comparison results for the stream hydrograph indicated a very good performance for nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 9 and coefficient of determination r2 0 94 respectively while percent bias pbias can be considered as good with the obtained 11 2 value moriasi et al 2015 the underestimation in peak flow can be attributed to surface runoff from summer thunderstorms originating outside the model domain and hence not captured in the hru runoff routines the underestimation could also be attributed to mis timing of irrigation return flows from the thousands of cultivated fields in the model domain detailed analysis of return flows can be found in wei and bailey 2019 the simulation period for swat modflow rt3d is from april 1999 to february 2016 with the first two years specified as a warm up period initial groundwater no3 and soluble p concentrations for each rt3d grid cell are provided by an 18 year warm up simulation this warm up period was prepared by repeating the weather crop management operation and pumping stresses for the year 2005 for 18 years until the groundwater solute concentrations achieved a steady seasonal fluctuation then the output solute concentrations were used to provide initial concentration for the calibration period of simulation initial values for μ n o 3 k n o 3 and the sorption partition coefficient for soluble p k d p o 4 were set to 0 001 day 1 5 mg l and 2 5 respectively model calibration was carried out using a combination of manual and automated methods zhang et al 2020a one at a time sensitivity analysis was performed manually for the parameters governing nutrient fate and transport up to 20 values within a realistic range were assigned to each parameter while keeping the other parameters constant to test the sensitivity of the in stream mass loading to each parameter tuppad et al 2010 douglas mankin et al 2010 dechmi et al 2012 özcan et al 2017 parameters shown in table 3 were found to be the most influential on nutrient in stream loading at the outlet of the study region then automated parameter estimation was performed with the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swat cup software tool using the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi2 abbaspour et al 2015 this allows for only swat parameters to be modified the in stream mass loading at the outlet was first calibrated by swat cup with the parameters listed in table 3 five iterations with a total of 2500 simulations following the procedure used in the original swat model for the study region wei et al 2018b monthly in stream no3 n mass loading was provided by gates et al 2018 who performed a stochastic mass balance on the arkansas river network system using measured stream discharge rates river stages and electrical conductivity in the streams monthly soluble p loading was estimated using the program load estimator loadest runkel et al 2004 by combining the observed daily flow rates with soluble p concentration available from june 2014 to february 2016 then manual calibration was performed using the groundwater transport parameters μ n o 3 k n o 3 and k d p o 4 based on published values mcmahon and böhlke 1996 mcmahon et al 1999 bailey et al 2014 finally swat cup was re run with 500 simulations to fine tune swat nutrient parameters to evaluate the improvement of swat modflow rt3d model over the original swat model the calibrated parameter set was applied directly to the swat model with the modified irrigation method described in section 2 1 model performance is estimated using statistical measures nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 and pbias the model is further verified by comparing simulated and observed groundwater nutrient concentration in stream nutrient concentrations in stream nutrient loadings and crop yield simulated crop yields are compared with county level observed data provided by the national agricultural statistical survey nass https quickstats nass usda gov alfalfa and corn are selected since they are the two major crops in the otero county wherein resides most irrigated fields in the model domain no targeted calibration was performed for crop yield 3 3 baseline model results 3 3 1 nutrient in stream loading and concentration monthly time series plots of simulated and measured nitrate and solute phosphorus in stream loading at the outlet of the watershed are shown in figs 4 a and 5 a respectively the black line with round dots represents the observation values and red lines with triangle dots represent simulations from the swat modflow rt3d model as can be seen from the figures the coupled model is able to track the spatiotemporal variability and magnitude of in stream loading for both species reasonably well for nitrate in stream loading the statistics during calibration period indicate satisfactory nse 0 51 good r2 0 65 and very good pbias 5 45 performance while nse 0 72 r2 0 83 and pbias 4 28 all represent very good performance during the validation period based on moriasi et al 2015 solute phosphorus in stream loading is considered to be very good for nse of 0 82 and r2 of 0 84 and satisfactory for pbias of 23 8 results show a good representation of nutrient in stream loadings during the entire simulation period however the model has lower accuracy to predict loadings for low flow periods especially during mar 12 to jun 13 for nitrate due to under estimation of streamflow simulated by swat modflow fig 3a this under estimation is likely due to the irregular and random management operations carried out locally by different farmers during this period which are difficult to account for accurately in the modelling processes the same issue was reported by other studies in intensively irrigated watersheds shultz et al 2018 wei et al 2021 in addition the nitrate in stream mass loading in this study is calibrated and validated against a stochastic mass balance model developed by gates et al 2018 which also contains uncertainty from measurement error the simulated nitrate in stream mass loading results from our model is located within the 95 inter percentile range black bars in fig 8a which indicates an acceptable model performance in simulating temporal magnitude of nitrate in stream loading at the outlet gage there is a marked improvement for swat modflow rt3d model as compared to the nutrient in stream results using the stand alone swat model wei et al 2018b green lines with rectangular dots in figs 4 a and 5 a the swat model consistently underestimates the nitrate and solute phosphorous in stream loading especially during the irrigation season a statistical comparison of simulated in stream loading at the outlet is given in table 4 one limitation of the calibration and validation process is the lack of long term monitoring time series water quality data this can lead to biased estimation of nutrient concentrations and loads in both surface subsurface water system thus comparisons between daily in stream nutrient concentrations daily groundwater nutrient concentrations at 4 wells and annual crop yield using monitoring field data were applied to further verify the baseline model performance as for nutrient in stream loading the calibrated model is verified by comparing the daily simulated and observed nutrient in stream concentration at the stream gauges sw 12 and sw 162 location is shown in fig 2c the horizontal black line and dot line respectively represent the colorado interim standard in warm water and in cold water time series comparisons for no3 n concentration are plotted from january 2006 to february 2016 fig 4b c whereas soluble p concentrations are only compared from january 2014 to february 2016 fig 5b c due to the availability of observation data in general simulated results are within the estimated error bar of the measured head values of 1 6 mg l 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 for no3 n and soluble p respectively however soluble p often is underestimated in terms of both loading fig 5a and in stream concentration fig 5b c this can be due to a number of reasons including spatially varying sorption rates in the aquifer overestimation of p sorption in soil profiles and underestimation of p attached to sediment in surface runoff however simulated magnitudes and temporal changes in in stream p concentration are within the range of observed p concentrations particularly when considering the error associated with measurement data i e error bars 3 3 2 groundwater nutrient concentrations a map of cell by cell temporally averaged 1999 2016 model results for nutrient concentration is shown in figs 6 a and 7 a no3 n concentrations range from 0 01 to 59 3 mg l 1 and soluble p values range from 0 to 2 12 mg l 1 with high concentration values occurring in irrigation dense areas and along the river corridor simulated and observed nutrient concentration at four groundwater monitoring wells throughout the study region are shown in fig 6 b e for no3 n and in fig 7 b e for soluble p with the location of wells shown in figs 6 a and 7 a for the magnitude of each species these comparisons indicate an acceptable match between the simulated and observed values favorable matches occur for no3 n simulation at well 13 and well 33 that increases and decreases in concentration are generally captured by the coupled model variations of the observed no3 n values at well 93 are not well captured likely due to the proximity to the upstream end of the tributary where groundwater flow and elevations are not well captured by the swat modflow model wei et al 2019 as for well 74 located along the corridor of the river ignoring the processes within the riparian zone which retain the release no3 n depending on seasonally variable environmental conditions could be the reason for the mis match this poor match can also be found for soluble p at the same location thus a future version of the model may include the chemical reaction parameter in the riparian zone to better estimate the influence on the groundwater nutrient concentrations as seen in fig 7 simulated soluble p does not have remarkable seasonal fluctuations during the simulation period in this study considering the great computational effort and the risk of over fitting a constant sorption partition coefficient rate is assigned for soluble p for the entire region however the dynamics of solute p in groundwater is substantially influenced by sorption of phosphorus onto soil particles sharpley 1995 if desired cell by cell sorption rates can be specified and calibrated to yield a better match with daily point measurements under anaerobic environments the presence of manganese sulfate and ferrous iron might also impact groundwater soluble p concentrations the large discrepancy between the model grid scale 250 m and the observation scale could also be one of the reasons for the poor match overall however the correct magnitudes and ranges are simulated the purpose of this study is to demonstrate the capability of the model to reproduce general spatial and temporal trends and distributions of groundwater no3 n and soluble p concentrations fig 8 shows frequency distribution plots for no3 n and p for all simulated and observed groundwater concentration values the average of the measured values in the observation wells 4 83 mg l 1 for no3 n and 0 13 mg l 1 for soluble p compares well to the annual averaged simulated values from all grid cells 4 91 mg l 1 for no3 n and 0 12 mg l 1 for soluble p according to the figure the general shape and magnitude of frequency for each concentration interval is similar to the frequency from the observed data especially for no3 n soluble p concentration is overestimated for the low range 0 1 mg l 1 and underestimated for the mid range 0 1 0 25 mg l 1 this is due in part to majority of monitoring wells being located in stream corridor areas which exhibit high p concentrations whereas the model results are taken from the entire model domain 3 3 3 groundwater nutrient mass loading to surface water annual averaged spatial distribution of simulated mass loading of no3 n and soluble p to the river system along the arkansas river and the tributaries during the 1999 2016 period are shown in fig 9 values are plotted for 731 river cells within the study region blue bars indicate mass loading from the stream to the aquifer whereas green yellow red bars represent mass loading from the aquifer to the river network it shows that the vast majority of nutrient loading happens from the aquifer into the river i e positive values with averaged no3 n mass ranging from 97 kg m to 907 kg m and solute p mass ranging from 5 4 kg m to 36 8 kg m in this study region the nutrient mass loading is highly spatial variable due to different local hydrological conditions and groundwater nutrient concentrations for the entire study area the 18 years average daily loading is 17 4 kg for no3 n and 0 34 kg for soluble p the individual subbasin loading has tremendous variability ranging from 8 3 kg to 196 3 kg and 0 2 kg to 4 8 kg for no3 n fig 7c and soluble p fig 7d respectively thus the figures provide important information regarding spatial patterns in loading rates indicating which subbasins provide the most nutrient mass the highlighted subbasins in fig 7c and d are the top 6 regions that respectively contains 50 and 60 of total mass loading of no3 n and soluble p from the aquifer to the streams these severe areas 15 of the watershed area could be targeted for bmp application 3 3 4 crop yield in colorado crop yield is an important factor to help evaluate water productivity dozier et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b annual comparison between observed and simulated corn yield and alfalfa yield is presented in fig 10 due to the data availability from nass results during 2001 to 2006 are compared black boxes and grey boxes represent simulated corn and alfalfa yields under the baseline scenario respectively while purple dash line and orange dash lines represent observed corn and alfalfa values based on results the coupled model was able to predict variations in crop yield with annual average yield of 9 7 tons ha 1 for corn and 7 3 tons ha 1 for alfalfa 4 quantifying the effect of bmps on no3 and p this section describes the method of implementing bmps and analysis of the results analysis is performed in terms of the ability of a given bmp to decrease no3 n and soluble p in stream concentrations groundwater concentrations solute mass loadings from groundwater to the surface river systems and solute mass loading from individual subbasins results are compared with baseline model results described in section 3 3 following an analysis of domain wide bmp implementation results of spatial bmp targeting also will be presented 4 1 description of bmp simulations the tested bmps in this study are related to irrigation management nutrient management water conveyance efficiency and tillage operations a total of 28 bmp scenarios were evaluated table 5 with an additional 20 combination bmps irrigation management consists of using optimum irrigation practices for example by replacing the traditional flood irrigation to more efficient drip sprinkler irrigation this improved efficiency can be achieved by adjusting irrigation efficiency irr eff and surface runoff ratio irr asq through auto irrigation operations in the swat management files for irrigation reduction ir scenarios irr asq were decreased by 10 and 30 and irr eff were increased by 10 and 30 ir10 and ir30 respectively so that the reduction of irrigation water would lower surface runoff and soil percolation which result in net reductions of solute transportation and mass loading into stream systems nutrient management to reduce the availability of excess nutrients is simulated by controlling the applied fertilizer amount frt kg in the swat management files two different fertilization reduction fr scenarios were developed by reducing the fertilizer amount by 10 fr10 and 30 fr30 these levels of reduction are judged reasonable to avoid appreciable crop yield decrease analysis of the impact on crop yield will be discussed with results seepage loss from earthen irrigation canals in the larv varies from 0 012 m3 s 1 km 1 to 0 04 m3 s 1 km 1 susfalk et al 2008 and provides a considerable source of recharge to shallow groundwater in this study seepage reductions sr were specified to 40 sr40 and 60 sr60 which can be achieved by lowering the river bed conductance in the modflow river package morway et al 2013 in the larv seepage reduction is possible through canal lining and sealing which has been tested by martin and gates 2014 by using linear anionic polyacrylamide to decease seepage losses the higher percent of seepage reduction indicates a higher level of labor and material investment land use management scenarios involving conservation tillage ct and no tillage nt operations were developed in typical field conditions tillage operations are carried out with conventional tillage including disk plow and moldboard plow these two practices increase the amount of residue on the surface between the period of harvest and planting the next crop tuppad et al 2010 conservation tillage leaves at least 30 of the soil surface covered with crop residue while no tillage is carried out by planting crop in the soil without any tillage operation in swat these tillage operations differ in terms of the mixing efficiency effmix and depth of mixing deptil which specify the fraction of residue on surface that are mixed uniformly through the soil depth specific values for each parameter are listed in table 5 scenarios 1 8 include individual bmps application with each bmp analyzed over a conservative and an aggressive level scenarios 9 12 13 24 and 25 28 represent the adoption of 2 3 and 4 concurrent bmps respectively due to the uncertainty associated with the land use management tillage operations were considered as a single bmp with no respective level assigned to it in order to limit the total number of bmp combinations associated with the computational time only bmps with the same respective levels of implementation i e irrigation management nutrient management and water conveyance efficiency were combined for 3 bmps and 4 bmps in this study the impact of bmp implementation on water quality is presented as percent reductions from the calibrated baseline swat modflow rt3d model for the same period 1999 2016 each bmp was simulated individually with all inputs except the parameters used to represent a bmp kept constant of the calibrated value the percent reduction was calculated as follows 6 reduction i 1 n prebm p i p o s t b m p i prebm p i 100 n where prebmp and postbmp are model outputs for month i before and after implementation of bmp respectively n is the total months during the simulated period a positive value indicates that the bmp reduced the outputs compared to the baseline condition whereas a negative value indicates that the bmp results in increased outcomes 4 2 bmp results 4 2 1 changes in nutrient groundwater concentrations average percent reduction of no3 n and soluble p concentration in groundwater for each of the bmp scenarios throughout the 18 yr simulation period is summarized in fig 11 the average nutrient reduction rates were computed using the simulation values in the second layer of the model which is the depth that monitoring wells located at for each bmp set the impact on reducing groundwater concentrations increases with the increasing level of implementation for individual bmps fr10 and sr40 under scenarios with conservative level of implementation were found to be effective at decreasing no3 n groundwater concentration by 4 and 3 respectively and decreasing soluble p by 0 9 and 0 5 respectively ir30 and fr30 scenarios under the aggressive level were more efficient to decrease the amount of nutrient leaching into the aquifer system with no3 n concentration reduced by 12 20 respectively and soluble p reduced by 1 and 2 respectively the conservation ir10 scenarios yielded a negligible decrease with 0 3 rate for no3 n and 0 1 for soluble p as a reminder irrigation reduction scenario is essentially increasing the irrigation efficiency rate 10 of increase in irrigation efficiency could likely result in several issues including lower the water content and increase the leaching time bailey et al 2015 in addition it is interesting to note that compared with the nt scenario the ct scenario resulted in a better reduction in groundwater nutrient concentrations which is because of soil evaporation increased by the conservation tillage resulted in the decrease of soil water content thus reduced infiltration simulated by ct scenario which led to less nutrient leaching into the aquifer system when comparing fig 11a and b it can be seen that all the bmp scenarios are more efficient to reduce the no3 n concentrations that the average percent reduction for no3 n was 15 with the highest rate of 41 whereas for soluble p the average percent was only 3 with the highest rate of 7 6 this is because the majority of soluble p was attached to soil surface when leaching through the soil profile the cell wise spatial reduction are illustrated in fig 12 a c for the selected combined 4 bmp of ir30 fr30 sr60 cf scenario 4 bmp scenario the highest reduction scenario it shows the difference of nutrient groundwater concentrations between the baseline scenarios shown in figs 6a and 7a and the simulated bmp scenarios for no3 n and soluble p respectively decreases in concentrations are represented by blue green yellow colors while increases in concentrations are showed in orange red colors the contour plots exhibit a large spatial variability of lowing the concentrations by this bmp with an average concentration decrease in no3 n and soluble p of 1 81 mg l 1 and 0 005 mg l 1 respectively many locations show a substantial decrease up to 18 mg l 1 for no3 n and 0 29 for soluble p as shown also in the histograms of fig 12b d uniform 4 bmps for no3 n 81 of the cells have a decrease greater than 20 and 54 of the cells have a decrease greater than 50 for soluble p 31 of cells have a decrease greater than 10 4 2 2 changes in nutrient mass loading to surface water simulated reductions in no3 n and soluble p mass loading into the arkansas river and its tributaries from aquifer system are summarized in fig 13 a among the individual bmp scenarios the seepage reduction scenarios were quite efficient in decreasing nutrient loadings from groundwater into the streams the reduction rate for the aggressive sr60 scenario is 39 for no3 n and 34 for soluble p while for the conservative sr40 scenario the rate is 14 for no3 n and 16 for soluble p respectively seepage reductions could result in a decrease in recharge from deep percolation to the groundwater system therefore lower water tables due to the decreased seepage rate could lead to a reduction in return flow and further decrease the nutrient mass loadings into rivers the most effective type of combined bmp occurred to be the ir30 fr30 ct sr60 scenario 4 bmp scenario with the reduction of 63 for no3 n and 49 for soluble p respectively under this scenario reductions in mass loading were achieved simultaneously by changing the recharge rate return flow rate and the nutrient concentrations in the return flow since ir10 and nt scenarios did not sufficiently affect groundwater concentrations fig 11 their influences on mass loading were negligible selected temporal variability of simulated reductions in nutrient mass loadings from aquifer to the rivers are shown for scenarios ir30 sr60 fr10 sr40 nt and ir30 fr30 ct sr60 in fig 13b c as can be seen from these figures the combined 4 bmp had the strongest impact on decreasing no3 n and soluble p concentrations followed by the 3 bmp scenario for the implementations of ir30 and sr60 the saved water could increase the stream stage thus result in the reductions of return flow and nutrient mass loading among the individual scenarios sr60 had the highest impact on nutrients control by lowing the recharge rate and water table to mitigate non beneficial consumptive use however it could lead to an increase of salinity in root zone if salt leaching is not adequate this tradeoff will need to be further estimated using a calibrated salt transport model like the one developed by bailey et al 2019 fig 14 summarized the removal efficiency of nutrient mass loadings from aquifer into each subbasin for the selected bmps as shown in the figure the 4 bmp scenario is the most efficient one with the average reduction rate of 34 for no3 n and 17 soluble p respectively the subbasin loading plots displays substantial spatial variability in the effectiveness of lowering mass loading 4 2 3 changes in nutrient in stream concentrations to the river system the overall average percent reductions in no3 n and soluble p in stream concentration at the outlet of the study region are summarized for each of the 28 bmps in fig 15 a fig 15a shows that ir10 has negative effect on reducing no3 n and soluble p in stream concentrations and result in a slightly increase of the concentrations at the outlet this is likely due to the increase of irrigation efficiency not being enough to compensate for the decrease of runoff ratio so that the same amount of fertilizer being applied to field cannot be diluted by the surface runoff leading to a higher nutrient concentration in surface water it has been demonstrated by ir10 fr10 scenario that in stream concentrations can be reduced by 14 and 9 for no3 n and soluble p respectively with a 10 fertilizer reduction added on the 10 irrigation reduction implementation at the aggressive level the fr30 is found to be the most effective individual bmp for lowing no3 n 25 and soluble p 10 followed by sr60 17 for no3 n and 8 for soluble p and ct 14 no3 n 5 for soluble p 4 bmp scenario again is the most effective type of combined bmp resulting in an average reduction of 52 and 40 respectively the influence of the nt scenario was negligible for in stream no3 n 0 14 and soluble p concentration 2 ct implementation turned out to have higher impact with the simulated percent reductions in 14 for no3 n and 5 for soluble p respectively this result is due to ct implementation mixing the residues properly in the top soil the build up of residues for nt implementation were easily loaded to the stream with surface runoff resulting in a higher nutrient concentration in the surface water on the other hand the low impact of nt implementation on nutrient mass loading into river fig 13a also affects the nutrient concentrations in surface water since this study region is a groundwater dominant region however if nt implementation is combined with the other bmps the reduction rates can be increased to 48 and 35 for no3 n and soluble p respectively fr30 sr60 nt scenario time series no3 n and soluble p concentrations simulated over both arkansas river and the tributaries were shown in fig 15b and c respectively the median concentrations were plotted under baseline scenario and the selected conservative and aggressive bmps to show the reduction more clearly these figures were plotted between 2006 and 2016 the conservative bmps include ir10 fr10 scenario and ir10 sr40 ct scenario while the aggressive bmps include fr30 scenario and ir30 fr30 sr60 ct scenario as can be seen from the figures all the scenarios showed a continuous reduction over the simulation period with the most impressive reduction generated by the ir30 fr30 sr60 ct scenario that the entire simulated no3 n and soluble p median concentrations were predicted under the colorado standard grey dash line in fig 15b and c the plot also revealed a slightly trend that the impact of bmps were increasing gradually over the simulation period due to the very slow movement of flow and nutrients in groundwater therefore conservative bmps could also work to achieve the colorado standard for a longer time period 4 2 4 changes for spatially targeted bmps in general the ir30 fr30 ct sr60 scenario is predicted to have the greatest overall impact to the nutrient reduction while fr30 scenario is the most effective singular bmp the impact of ir30 fr30 ct sr60 scenario on the crop productions is presented in fig 10 the average reduction in crop yield are 22 and 4 for corn red boxes and alfalfa green boxes respectively in the case of alfalfa the lower impact is due to it is a perennial legume fixing nitrogen from the air n fertilizers are generally only needed for early stage of its establishment davis et al 2005 in addition fr30 scenario resulted in a 36 corn reduction for the entire region mainly due to the sensitivity of fluctuations in fertilizer that stress the corn plant for the economic sustainability of irrigated agriculture it is important to consider the impact of the bmp scenarios on farmer s profits and realize that nutrient management strategies might decrease crop yield therefore a localized targeting scheme for fertilizer reduction likely is more realistic wherein nutrient management is implemented for certain field sets or subbasins within the larger watershed area to this end an additional simulation was run in which the most efficient bmp combination 4 bmps were applied only to 6 targeted subbasins shown in fig 9 fig 16 shows the predicted no3 n a b and soluble p c d median concentrations from the arkansas river and its tributaries of baseline scenarios fr30 scenarios and 4 bmps scenarios fig 16 reveals that the targeted bmps also have impact on reducing in stream concentrations but not as substantial as the reduction that uniformly applied to the entire region since the plots also reveal a trend of increasing impact over time it will take longer for targeted applied bmps to achieve their full effect groundwater cell wise reduction based on the targeted 4 bmp scenario is presented in fig 12b d with red boxes represent no3 n and green boxes represent soluble p respectively it indicates similar results with in stream concentrations reduction that the targeted applied bmps is decreasing the nutrients concentrations however their effectiveness is less than the uniformly applied bmps regarding the corn production the impact of the targeted 4 bmp scenario and targeted fr30 scenario lead to a 20 and 13 reduction rate 2 and 9 better than the uniformly 4 bmp scenario overall crop production and nutrient reduction are strongly impacted by the region of investigated implementation when applying bmps only in 6 targeted subbasins many areas of the study region can have a significant decrease in no3 n and soluble p therefore the most potential cost effective approach is to control nutrient loading from the major source areas and regional impact can be achieved by focusing bmps on localized areas there is not one set of universal bmps the effectiveness of bmps varies among studies indicating that the most effective bmps likely depend on specific circumstances of individual watersheds however the modelling results of the need for combined implementation of bmps and strategic targeting of locations can help policy makers to effectively design programs to maintain cost in compensating the farmers for their yield loss 5 summary and conclusions this paper presents a physically based spatially distributed model that simulates no3 and soluble p fate and transport in a coupled stream aquifer system and applies the model to investigate the impact of water and land management bmps on no3 and p in this system the swat modflow rt3d model wei et al 2018a was modified to include soluble p groundwater transport and accounts for the major processes that govern no3 n and soluble p movement transformation and storage in intensively managed irrigated stream aquifer systems including application of irrigation water from surface canals and pumping wells crop growth and rotation seepage of canal water infiltration and percolation of irrigation water loading of n and p fertilizer sorption denitrification and groundwater surface water interactions due to the elevated nutrient concentrations in the irrigation system the cycling of n and p mass in irrigation water was also included in the modelling code the model was tested in a 732 km2 irrigated stream aquifer system in the lower arkansas river valley colorado during the 1999 2016 time period with model output compared to observed groundwater concentration in stream loading in stream concentration and crop yield for both no3 and p the tested model was used to evaluate the potential impact of water and land bmps to decrease no3 n and soluble p concentrations in the groundwater mass loading to river and stream concentrations relative to baseline conditions for individual bmps ir30 with 12 reduction rate and fr30 with 20 reduction rate are showed to be efficient to lower concentrations in groundwater water conveyance efficiency i e seepage reductions are simulated to be efficient to decrease soluble mass loading into river with reduction rate of 39 and 34 for no3 n and soluble p respectively conservative irrigation management ir10 and no tillage are not as impactful as other bmps results also demonstrate that fr30 is the most effective individual bmp for lowing in stream concentrations of no3 n 25 and soluble p 9 benefit of bmps in combination with one another is also revealed by this study among all the combined bmps the ir30 fr30 ct sr60 scenario appears to be have the most significant reduction for both no3 n and soluble p contamination however efficient corn productivity cannot be achieved by the combination implementation therefore a targeted approach in which bmps were applied to only 15 of the watershed area was tested and is recommend to remediate water quality while maintaining crop yield 6 code availability swat modflow rt3d is available at https swat tamu edu software swat modflow source code tutorial and

4561,the scope of this work is to present a new fast and reliable transfer function model which simulates the spatio temporal distribution of non point source solutes along the unsaturated zone suitable to be used at large scales within a web based decision support system with the assumptions of a a gravity induced water flow b a non reactive solute and c a purely convective flow the model uses the transfer functions i e the travel time tt probability density functions derived from the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve k θ the output concentration of a solute is simply the convolution of the transfer functions with the input concentrations to the system a model sensitivity analysis based on monte carlo simulations was carried out showing that saturated water content and the tortuosity parameter τ were the parameters that affected the mean tt more the model was validated against concentration experiments carried out on four large soil columns results were really good for all soils with the best agreement with r2 0 97 rmse 0 11 and me 0 01 moreover the outputs obtained applying the model to 46 soil profiles sampled in the valle telesina in southern italy completely characterised from the hydrological point of view were compared with those obtained from the richard based model hydrus 1d the result of the comparisons gave a very high correlation coefficient above 0 8 a mean absolute error between the two models of around 40 days and a percent bias of 16 finally the application of transfer function model to a large spatial extent is presented to show its possible use for the groundwater vulnerability assessment keywords extended transfer function travel times hydraulic conductivity curve spatial leaching model groundwater vulnerability assessment 1 introduction the effort to combine productivity with more sustainable water and soil resources management is imperative in many policies such as in the united nations sustainable development goals https sustainabledevelopment un org and in the new european green deal strategy https ec europa eu info strategy priorities 2019 2024 european green deal en more specifically the european nitrate directive dir 91 676 eec the pesticide directive dir 2009 128 ec and the water framework directive dir 2000 60 ec state the prioritizing actions to be applied from each eu member state for the protection and the avoidance of deterioration of waters however these policy maker requests do not always correspond to the availability of really operational tools the study of non point source nps chemical contaminants requires a multidisciplinary approach which encompasses hydrology soil science as well as spatial statistics and geographic information systems coppola et al 2013a since they are widespread at local regional and global scales several spatial leaching modelling systems were proposed in recent years in petach et al 1991 leach m was used to simulate the movement of four classes of chemicals through layered soils for pesticide management and for estimating potential leaching hazards zhang et al 1996 combined an index and overlay model i e the drastic model aller 1985 with the process based numerical model hydrus simunek et al 1998 2012 vero et al 2017 also proposed an hydrus based framework which considered existing soil maps meteorological data and different land use to estimate solute time lags at catchment scale the root zone water quality model rzwqm ahuja et al 2000 kumar et al 1999 is a process based agricultural model that can be applied to quantify the effect of nitrate leaching through the vadose zone on the environment pearl geopearl tiktak et al 2002 was used to calculate the leaching potential of pesticides into local surface waters and the regional groundwater considering the soil type land use climate and groundwater depth class for 6405 plots combining the 1d pesticide leaching model pearl with a geographical information system holman et al 2004 proposed the macro emulator a spatially distributed modelling system for predicting pesticide losses to groundwater eventually the user friendly gis based and client server software vulpes based on pelmo leaching model di guardo and finizio 2015 was developed to identify vulnerable areas at regional level however despite their wide use these models fail to be really operational for policy applications being mostly based on desktop solutions often too computational demanding moreover these approaches often fail in the crucial interaction between end users and scientists well defined by the following statement taken by bouma et al 2008 rather than following traditional top down and disciplinary research approaches emphasis is increasingly being placed on interactive interdisciplinary work in communities of practice cops in which scientists work together with various stakeholders and policymakers in a joint learning mode in order to fulfill these requests in the last decade much progress has been accomplished in development of geo spatial decision support systems freely available on the web explicitly accounting for water flow and transport of dissolved contaminants through the vadose zone at different spatio temporal scales terribile et al 2015 these systems allow the so called on the fly modelling in support of the what if scenario procedures in this context the use of high cpu demanding models based on numerical solutions is not advisable e g richards combined with advective dispersion equation therefore the aim of this work is to present the extended transfer function model tfm ext for the estimation of the travel times of the nps which promises to be a fast and reliable tool for the groundwater vulnerability assessment in support of the previously cited directives within the larger spatial decision support system s dss developed for landsupport h2020 project https www landsupport eu the work is organized as follows section 2 presents the rationale behind the need of the tfm ext model section 3 presents i the theory behind the model ii the sensitivity analysis to its parameter variations trough a monte carlo technique iii its validation using four large undisturbed soil columns iv the comparison with the physically based model hydrus 1d and v the application at the valle telesina extent in support of the groundwater vulnerability assessment section 4 describes the valle telesina and the hydraulic properties dataset section 5 reports and discusses the results of the tfm ext testings and comparisons the conclusions of the study are given in section 6 2 rationale behind the development of tfm ext in order to let the interested reader enter in the rationale behind the tfm ext model within a web based s dss we try to do a simple example of a typical problem we would face a regional policy maker should define the zones vulnerable to nitrates and pesticides in a selected region of interest roi in this roi let s suppose of around 50 km2 we distinguish 4 soil polygons with different hydraulic characteristics 6 different land uses different crops 2 climates a part of the roi is uphill and a groundwater table depth variable for each point of the domain besides the spatial variability the policy maker wants also to consider the time evolution of nitrate and pesticide leaching both with past and future scenarios let s consider that again for simplicity the policy maker is only interested in 2 particular years of simulation combining the spatial and temporal variability of the variable considered to give an answer to the policy maker we need to run at most around 400 simulations if we make a further simplification on the groundwater table depth the policy maker though wants a real time answer to his her problem which should also be effective clearly understandable on a dynamic map freely accessible on the web and he she also wants to be able to consider another roi with different crops bigger than the previous one and a longer simulation of 10 years for example in such a case the number of required simulations will increase by orders of magnitude it is important to stress that most of times the end users are not modellists used to play with partial differential equations and possible related problems multiple parameters definition possibility of not convergence of the solutions climatic issues and so on this situation should be absolutely avoided in order to have the widest application of the models in the community overcoming the historical trade off between the research scientific world and the everyday real life applications requiring effective clear and real time answers bouma et al 2008 bouma 2015 is there a model able to help the policy maker considering all the previous needs in a fast and a physically meaning ways giving him her an immediately interpretable answer to his her problems the last is our key science question which we are trying to answer by proposing the tfm ext model to be implemented within a web based spatial decision support system s dss the use of these systems in fact through dedicated full open access platform allows real time responses and the production of scenario analysis by different end users queries they are not simply web gis system but dynamic environments that could address many different issues from forest resources management marano et al 2019 to olive growing manna et al 2020 and more 3 methods tfm ext is based on jury s transfer functions jury 1982 jury and roth 1990 which are defined as the probability density functions of the travel times at a given time and depth transfer functions are widely used in several disciplines such as in catchment hydrology botter et al 2011 rinaldo et al 2011 rigon et al 2016b in population dynamics and demography bongaarts and feeney 2003 and more calabrese and porporato 2015 rigon et al 2016a they allow to compute the output concentration of a solute by simply convolve the transfer functions with the input concentrations to the system in this work the transfer functions are derived from the hydraulic conductivity functions defined for each layer of the unsaturated zone starting from the approach reported in scotter and ross 1994 other simplified models based for example on the estimation of the unsaturated vertical subsurface travel time e g lee and casey 2005 fenton et al 2011 sousa et al 2013 szymkiewicz et al 2018 2019 despite being very effective don t compute the output solute flux concentration in time and depth as we can do using the transfer functions it is important to stress that tfm ext is not intended to describe in details local scale transport behaviour but as already reported in section 3 it was thought to fulfil the following objectives to integrate a simplified statistical approach with physically based hydrological parameters to be valid for large scale applications but still keeping a physical meaning to be easy to interpret 3 1 model description according to the jury s transfer function model tfm ext computes the output solute flux concentration c z z t ml 3 at a given depth z and a given time t as follows 1 c z z t 0 t c o 0 t f f z t t dt where c 0 t ml 3 is the solute concentration at the surface t is a dummy variable and f f z t is the travel times probability density function tt pdf for a travel distance z conditional to time t in this study a time invariant form of the tt pdf was assumed since the solution of the water budget within the specific control volume is a key point to apply the time variant theory e g botter et al 2011 rinaldo et al 2011 harman 2015 rigon et al 2016b if for simplicity we consider a simple bucket model with a linear reservoir one for each soil layer we have as a minimum 2 parameters to be defined i e to be calibrated after the previous discussion made in section 2 on the spatio temporal variability of our policy maker request adding parameters to be calibrated and ordinary differential equations to be solved would not be an easy task for our problem the situation is even worse if we consider solving richards equation which would be actually required to have the correct solutions of the water budget at this scale of interest according to scotter and ross 1994 tfm ext derives the tt pdfs from the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ with the assumptions of a a gravity induced water flow b a conservative and nonreactive solute and c a purely convective flow as follows 2 f f z t 1 q dk θ dt where f f z t t 1 is the travel time pdf q lt 1 is the steady state flow rate k θ lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity function and θ is the water content the steady state flow rate q can easily be derived from a water budget at the control volume considering constant input fluxes e g constant mean daily net precipitation at the surface boundary for a given steady state flow rate q eq 2 allows to derive the tt pdf for each horizon of soil profile starting from the corresponding k θ curve the hydraulic conductivity function was assumed to be described by the van genucthen mualem vgm equations van genuchten 1980 3 k θ k 0 s e τ 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where s e is effective saturation h l is the pressure head α l 1 is related to the inverse of the air entry pressure head n and m are shape parameters with the constrain that m 1 1 n θ θ r and θ s are the actual the residual and the saturated water contents respectively k 0 lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity at θ θ s and τ is a parameter which accounts for the dependence of the tortuosity and the correlation factors on the water content the time derivative of the hydraulic conductivity function according to eq 2 is reported in appendix a k θ can be made varying with time which is actually the travel time and not the clock time with some simple variable substitutions we could also reverse the concept i e we can look at the travel time variation related to the variation of water content and thus of the hydraulic conductivity some considerations about the hydraulic conductivity function help to better understand the involved transport processes in particular in fig 1 θ is the actual water content induced in the soil by q thus assuming a unit gradient q k θ and dq d θ identifies the largest pore pathway where the maximum velocity is reached the pores corresponding to θ θ are not involved in the water flow and thus are not accounted in eq 2 once the tt pdf is derived for each horizon the solute transport along the whole soil profile requires an additional hypothesis on the correlation among travel times in the different horizons hamlen and kachanoski 1992 we assume that the travel times of a solute particle in one soil horizon are uncorrelated to the travel times to the other soil horizons in this case the entire soil profile can be described by the first and second moments i e the mean and the variance of the breakthrough curve c z z t hamlen and kachanoski 1992 and can be computed as follows 5 e z t i 1 m e i z t 6 var z t i 1 m var i z t where e z t and var z t are the mean and the variance of the travel times to depth z m is the number of the soil horizon and e i z t and var i z t are the mean and variance on the i th horizon respectively in particular the mean and the variance of the travel times are calculated according to leij and dane 1991 as follows 7 m i n z t 0 t n 1 c z z t dt 0 1 c z z t dt where n is the order of the moment i e 1 for the mean e i z t and 2 for the variance var i z t and c z z t is the concentration of the solute at the time t and depth z in the present study the upper limit of the moment integrals was bounded considering the time t at which 98 of the total input mass injected at the surface was recovered at the investigated depth z in this way the possible long tail of the travel time distributions didn t affect the moment computations avoiding uncertainties in the numerical calculation of the integrals let s assume now that we are interested in transport to depths greater than the soil depth for which the tfm ext has been developed e g below the soil profile till the groundwater table level let s define z the depth to which we have all the information on the hydraulic parameters l the depth of interest where l is greater than z between z and l the properties governing the transport are unknown to extend the process till l we used the generalized transfer function gtf proposed by zhang 2000 which assumed a lognormal form for the travel times distribution expressed as follows 8 f f l t 1 2 π 0 5 σ l t t exp ln t μ l t 2 2 σ l t 2 where μ l t and σ l t are the moments of the ln t at the depth l they can be obtained by inverting the following relations with the mean and the variance of the travel times at depth l 9 e l t exp μ l t σ l t 2 2 10 var l t exp 2 μ l t σ l t 2 exp σ l t 2 1 where according the gtf e l t and var l t are assumed to scale with depth between z and l as follows 11 e l t e z t l z λ 1 12 var l t var z t l z 2 λ 2 λ 1 and λ 2 are the parameters that account for the propagation of the travel time moments which allow to classify the transport process according to the difference λ 1 λ 2 i if λ 1 λ 2 0 the process is stochastic convective ii if λ 1 λ 2 0 the process is scale dependent iii if λ 1 λ 2 0 5 the model is convective dispersive zhang 2000 since we are considering uncorrelated travel times between layers then λ 1 λ 2 0 5 and the process is convective dispersive jury 1982 jury and roth 1990 in summary for each soil horizon between the surface and z where we assume to know all the hydraulic parameters we can calculate the tt pdf through the eq 2 between z and l we assume a lognormal form of the tt pdf according to the gtf whose parameters are computed from the mean and the variance of the travel times at depth z eqs 9 and 10 which are scaled with the power of the ratio of z and l according to eqs 11 and 12 3 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the proposed tfm ext model to the variation of the parameters θ r θ s α n k 0 τ was tested using the dataset of the measured hydraulic properties of the soils of the valle telesina site fully described in section 4 firstly the correlation matrix was computed and the cumulative distribution function cdf was derived for θ r θ s α n k 0 τ carsel and parrish 1988 where the normality was directly obtained the normal gaussian distribution was adopted otherwise a transformation was applied to achieve normality in particular three transformed normal distributions known as the johnson system johnson et al 1970 were chosen 1 lognormal ln y ln x 2 log ratio sb y ln x a b x 3 hyperbolic arcsine su y sinh 1 u ln u 1 u 2 1 2 where x is the untransformed parameter a and b are the upper and lower bounds of the investigated parameter and u x a b a in order to choose the best fitting distribution for each parameter the kolmogorov smirnov test was used then to test the model sensitivity a monte carlo approach was used to generate n sets of realizations of the investigated parameters two cases were considered a all parameters as correlated and b all the parameters as not correlated smith and diekkrüger 1996 coppola et al 2009 in the case of correlated parameters the random fields were obtained with a monte carlo procedure from the correlated multivariate normal distribution by generating a vector r n of independent standard normal deviates and then applying a linear transformation of the form x μ lr n where μ is the vector of means and l is the lower triangular matrix derived from the symmetric covariance matrix v ll t decomposed by cholesky factorization according to carsel and parrish 1988 to help the interpretation of the results of the sensitivity analysis the relative importance index toward the variance ri p of the travel times paleologos and lerche 1999 avanidou and paleologos 2002 and the relative deviation method rd hamby 1995 were computed in particular the first was computed as follows 13 ri p σ t p 2 p 1 p σ t p 2 where p is the p th parameter we are considering and σ t p 2 is the variance of the travel times obtained varying the p th parameter the rd was computed as 14 rd σ t p μ t p this index measures the amount of variability in the model output while varying each input parameter one at a time according to its probability density function and it is similar to a coefficient of variation eventually the model sensitivity toward the variation of the steady state input flux was tested while keeping the investigated parameters fixed to their mean 3 3 soil columns validation the validation of the model was performed by using data from previously conducted experiments on large undisturbed soil columns between 70 and 120 cm high 40 cm in diameter as detailed reported in coppola et al 2004 the columns as represented in fig 2 were fed by means of a tension infiltrometer hydraulically connected to a mariotte bottle the steady state flow rates used during the experiments were 130 cm d 1 for column p1 100 cm d 1 for column p3 200 cm d 1 for column p4 and 35 cm d 1 for column p5 double wire time domain reflectometry tdr probes were inserted at different depths to monitor water content and solute resident concentrations during water infiltration and solute transport experiments the parameters of the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions of the columns reported in table 1 were obtained by solving an inverse problem of parameter estimation the solute resident concentrations cr were derived from transmission line tdr probe impedance measurements for further details on the experimental methodology the interested reader can refer to coppola et al 2004 the columns belonging to four different soils were selected as test cases for the present work whose texture organic matter content and hydraulic parameters are reported in table 1 3 4 hydrus 1d comparison the model hydrus 1d simunek et al 2016 was chosen for a comparison of the results of the tfm ext obtained for a large spatial scale application hydrus 1d numerically solves the richards equation for variably saturated water flow and advection dispersion type equations for solute transport the flow equation incorporates a sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots see table 2 for for each soil profile of the valle telesina the following vegetation and upper boundary conditions were considered as regards hydrus 1d we considered 3 years 2002 2004 of variable precipitation and reference evapotranspiration from the historical dataset the initial conditions were set with a pressure head equal 100 cm while the lower boundary conditions were set to the free drainage and the zero concentration gradient the hydraulic conductivity curve was assumed to be described by the vgm model for the solute transport the equilibrium model was used and only one non reactive solute was considered which was injected the first day of the simulation with a value of 43 5 mmol l 1 the dispersivity varied between 2 4 and 12 8 cm for around forty soil samples it was measured carrying out inflow outflow experiments with the procedure described in coppola et al 2011 while for the remaining soil horizons we set the value according to similar textural classes 150 nodes for each profile 1 cm spacing were considered the root water uptake model was chosen the one proposed by feddes et al 1978 with no solute stress where the root parameters were set to literature values of pasture accordingly leaf area index lai and light extinction coefficient were set for the entire period equal to 2 m2 m 2 and 0 39 respectively as regards tfm ext to obtain the constant flux q eq 2 1 we considered 3 years 2002 2004 of variable precipitation and reference evapotranspiration from the historical dataset 2 we simulated using the fao model allen et al 1998 the actual evapotranspiration considering the crop and water stress coefficients 3 we cumulated the annual volumes and computed the constant mean daily net precipitation despite there were really small difference in the cumulated annual volumes of actual evapotranspiration computed by the two models less than 30 mm year 1 they were considered negligible since they didn t affect significantly the mean daily net precipitation on the breakthrough curves obtained at the soil profile depth i e 150 cm the mean and the variance of the travel times were calculated according to eq 7 and compared to those obtained with the tfm ext 3 5 tfm ext application at a large spatial extent as stated in the introduction and in section 2 tfm ext was conceived to be implemented in the s dss to predict in real time nps travel times therefore we present a particular application to the valle telesina case study supposing to be interested to evaluate the filtering capacity of the soils at a fixed groundwater depth of 3 meters the scope is to better highlight the potentiality of the model for the policy makers in support of the definition of the vulnerable areas the inputs for the spatial application are for the user defined area i the depth of interest ii the soil types iii the climate iv the land uses and v the crop managements the full characterization of soil layers to 3 meters depth was not available but only till 1 5 m as described in section 4 the climate was considered spatially variable the land use considered for the entire valley was the alpha alpha fertilized with a non reactive solute of 0 65 mmol l 1 4 study case 4 1 study site the valle telesina site located in southern italy is a 200 km2 area with five different landscape systems limestone mountains with volcanic ash deposits at the surface hills comprised of marl arenaceous flysch pediment plain comprised of colluvium material from the slope fan of the limestone reliefs ancient alluvial terraces and the actual alluvial plain such complexity is echoed in the 60 soil typological units which were aggregated into 46 soil mapping units as shown in fig 3 the climate is typically mediterranean characterized by warm dry summers and cool mild winters with a mean annual rainfall of around 1000 mm mainly distributed between autumn and winter and a mean annual temperature of around 15 c alfieri et al 2019 4 2 hydraulic properties dataset in each representative profile of the soil mapping units undisturbed soil samples were collected from the horizons using cylindrical steel samplers 8 5 cm diameter and 12 0 cm high in the laboratory the samples were saturated by slowly wetting from the bottom in order to remove all the air entrapped in the soil the maximum water content θ 0 was gravimetrically determined and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured by a falling head permeameter reynolds and elrick 2002 then the wind method arya 2002 was applied to simultaneously determine the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions by subjecting the soil samples to an evaporation process after sealing the bottom surface to prevent drainage during the evaporation process at appropriate pre set time intervals the weight of the whole sample and the pressure head at three different depths were measured an iterative procedure was applied for estimating the water retention curve from these measurements then the instantaneous profile method was applied to determine the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity θ r θ s α and n parameters in eq 4 were derived by fitting the soil water retention data under the restriction m l l n τ and k 0 parameters were derived by fitting the hydraulic conductivity data to eq 3 details of the tests and overall calculation procedures are described in basile et al 2012 the parameters obtained in the laboratory were then scaled to better reproduce the field behaviour by following the procedure suggested by basile et al 2003a 2006 finally for the few soils having considerable stone content a correction of θ s and k s to take into account the stoniness was applied coppola et al 2013b 5 results and discussion this section describes and discusses the results of i the tfm ext model sensitivity analysis ii the model validation against measured data in large soil columns iii the comparison of the results obtained with tfm ext and hydrus 1d model and iv the application to the valle telesina case study 5 1 sensitivity analysis first for each parameter the appropriate theoretical cdf was derived table 3 reports the upper a and lower b limits of variation which were inferred from the dataset the type of transformation applied the mean the standard deviation the coefficient of variation cv of the original parameter and the value of the minimum deviation d between the empirical and the fitted cdfs according to the kolomogorov smirnoff test while θ r was already normally distributed and thus no transformation was applied for θ s and α the best transformation was the johnson hyperbolic arcsine su the johnson log ratio transformation sb was chosen for n and τ and eventually the lognormal distribution for k 0 the monte carlo procedure allowed to perform the model sensitivity analysis in fig 5 only the results of the uncorrelated case are shown since the parameters shown a small correlation from the barplot of the ri toward the variance it is possible to infer some useful information θ s and τ are responsible for 32 and 60 of the travel times variance respectively therefore the tfm ext model is mostly sensitive to these parameters on the contrary θ r variability showed no influence at all while α n and k 0 showed only a small relative importance 1 3 4 the θ s and τ also show the biggest rd with 0 25 and 0 50 values respectively i e the variability in the travel times due to the variation of the two parameters is high confirming the high sensitivity of the model to those parameters while the high relative importance of θ s was somehow expected since its influence on the flow and transport processes the high ri of τ and the small ri of k 0 is interesting τ is usually regarded as an empirical calibration parameter the explanation may be found by looking at the impact of these parameters on the shape of the hydraulic conductivity curve in fig 1 θ s and k s shift the curve along the θ and k axis respectively while the parameter τ controls the slope of the curve for given θ s and τ the variation of k s simply induces a relatively small shift of the curve on the k axis and an elongation of the vertical part of the curve close to saturation overall the change in the k s may produce significant effects on the travel time pdf only for high top boundary fluxes thus bringing soil water content close to saturation in this sense even a high cv as observed for the k s may only have limited effects on the variability of the travel time pdf by contrast the same variation in the water content completely modifies the position of the hydraulic conductivity curve in the k θ plane with significant effects on the derivative of the k θ and thus on the size of the pores involved in the transport at a given top boundary flux in turn this behavior significantly affects the variability of the travel time pdf similar conclusions can be drawn for the parameter τ with the additional effect of a very high cv which has itself consequences on the variability of the travel time pdf this is particularly clear in fig 4 where as an example the effect of the variability of τ on the hydraulic conductivity curve left panel and consequently on the dimensionless flux concentration i e the travel time cdf right panel is shown especially in the first part of the curves e g 20 days clear differences in the values of the travel time cdf can be appreciated between the 4 curves the fact that a large cv of an input parameter does not automatically imply large variability in the output has already been discussed in the literature see for example coppola et al 2009 evidently the contribution of a parameter to the output depends not so much on its cv as on the sensitivity of the model to the parameter itself the sensitivity analysis of the tfm ext model with respect to variations in the steady water flux q was also performed the parameters were set to their mean values while q varied between 0 1 and 1 cm d 1 results of the procedure are reported in fig 6 where the blue line represents the evolution of the mean travel times and the red line represents the evolution of the variance of the travel times both moments showed the same behaviour they decreased sharply till a certain q value around 0 3 cm d 1 and then tended to an asymptotic value of around 45 days and 3000 d2 for the mean and variance respectively fig 1 allows to interpret these results as follows as soon as q increases more pores contribute to the flow and reduces indeed the mean travel times till a certain value after this value all the porous space is involved in the flow process till the upper limit of complete saturation θ θ s thus poorly contributing to both mean and variance tt in fact as soon as q increases even a relatively large variation in its value determines a small variation in θ till the upper limit θ s after which the system produces runoff q k s this is true and holds since the transport in the soil column is considered vertical towards the groundwater if other mechanisms of runoff generation are considered such as shallow subsurface flow or surface runoff then an increase in q would not necessarily decrease the variability in the travel times 5 2 soil columns validation fig 7 shows the results of the validation of the tfm ext for the four soil columns chosen the dimensionless breakthrough curves measured black dots and simulated red lines were compared and some goodness of fit indices were computed in general we can observe that the model performs quite well for all the four cases with the best agreement obtained for the p5 column where the r2 0 97 the rmse 0 11 and the me is 0 01 and the less accurate obtained for the p3 column that still showed a r2 0 88 the rmse 0 22 and the me 0 16 as reported for each graph in the figure these results are really promising since we have to keep in mind that no parameter of the tfm ext was calibrated overall we recognize that the three different shapes of breakthrough curves are well reproduced by the tfm ext model p1 and p4 columns show a similar behaviour with an early response and a breakthrough time of around 5 h 0 2 days p3 column shows an overestimation of solute concentration respect to the measured one still showing a breakthrough time of around 5 h 0 2 days p5 column displays a s shaped breakthrough curve which is slightly smoother according to the model with a later breakthrough time of around 12 h 0 45 days despite its important assumptions on the steady state input flux tfm ext through these validation versus real data from large undisturbed soil columns proved to be robust in reproducing the breakthrough curves for different layered soils with no calibration of any parameter required other validations at field scale in layered soils would not have been feasible at all 5 3 hydrus 1d comparison the moments of the breakthrough curves obtained applying the tfm ext and hydrus1d at the same soil depth of 150 cm were finally compared for all the soil polygons of the valle telesina as described in section 3 4 results of the application are shown in the scatter plot in fig 8 where the black points represent the mean travel times the black line represents the regression line and the red dashed line represents the bisector it is immediately clear that there was a really good agreement between the two models with a correlation coefficient of 0 83 a mean absolute error of around 40 days and a percent bias of 15 8 the regression line appears to be almost parallel to the bisector coefficient of 1 06 with an intercept of 29 3 days the maximum hydrus 1d overestimation was obtained for the soil profile id p32 where the travel times were 199 days using hydrus 1d and of 109 using the tfm ext the higher tt in hydrus 1d were determined by high k s values which for the lower horizon was around 430 cm d 1 the variable upper boundary condition determined the soil to be very wet only for short period during rainy events while remaining rather dry for a longer period thus leading to a slower response of hydrus 1d with respect to tfm ext further tests to assess the goodness of the assumption of a log normal distribution against the use of real data were conducted we saw that for a greater depth 4 m and the same flux 0 174 cm day a loamy sand showed a mean travel time of 172 days while a clay soil showed a mean travel time of 633 days also in these cases we obtained good agreements with hydrus results in line with the previous outcomes these results are positively surprising and further confirm that the steady state hypothesis underlying the tfm ext model holds true finally since one of the key points of the proposed model was to be fast besides being effective from the computational point of view the run time for a single soil profile for hydrus is between of 3 s and 2 min while tfm ext took around 1 2 s to process all the 46 soil profiles 5 4 valle telesina spatial application the spatial application of the tfm ext to the valle telesina case study is shown in fig 9 as reported in section 3 the depth of simulation was 3 m for all the soils for all profiles the mean annual precipitation was equal to 795 mm yr 1 and the reference et was equal to 950 mm yr 1 the mean net precipitation varied between 0 112 cm d 1 and 0 181 cm d 1 408 mm yr 1 and 660 mm yr 1 this application is particularly interesting since it allows to compare the different dynamics determined by the multiple soil characteristics and input fluxes being equals the depth and the land use the mean travel times are categorized in ten intervals from 132 red to 712 green days it is worth noticing that around the 40 of the soil units coloured in light green to dark green in the map have mean travel times above 365 days these are mainly located on the hills and on the upper part of the mountains above the 300 m a s l given the slow response to the solute injection these areas shown a good filtering capacity and therefore could be classified as less vulnerable to possible contaminations compared to the other some soil units present low mean tt in the interval 132 248 days red spots on the mountains and the alluvial plain the red spots on the mountains belong to the same types of soils that according to the usda are classified as lithic and typic hapludands this is not surprising because these soils showing andic features as often mentioned in literature have distinct hydraulic properties namely high hydraulic conductivity in wet conditions similar to sandy soils and high water retention capacity similar to clay soils terribile et al 2018 bartoli et al 2007 basile et al 2003b therefore since the tfm ext model is strongly based on the hydraulic conductivity curve and not on the water retention curve the former prevails and determines the fast tt of soils showing andic features the other red spots in the alluvial plain correspond to the soils that are formed on alluvial deposits and classified as fluvic cambisols with loamy texture because these soils are at the beginning of their pedogenesis they have a moderately developed soil structure with poor macroporosity and connectivity terribile et al 2011 these pedological features correspond to low values of k s and high values of τ thus justifying the lower mean travel times 6 conclusion the purpose of this study was to present the tfm ext for the estimation of solute travel times to a certain fixed depth which deploy a simplified statistical approach based on the transfer functions approach integrated by soil s physical properties in the broad array of leaching models tfm ext was conceived to require small computational efforts while being physically based in fact the main reason behind the model was the need to have a fast and effective tool for real time on line simulations required by the new frontier of the web based decision support systems the input soil type the climate the land use and the crop management are spatially available and real time overlapped to obtain possible infinite combinations and model runs on which to evaluate the nps travel times according to tfm ext it is possible to derive the travel times pdf based on the hydraulic conductivity function and characteristic of each layer of the soil moreover the model extends the transport process to the generic depth z where information on the hydraulic properties couldn t be available making the assumption of a lognormal travel time pdf whose parameters are scaled according to the generalized transfer function model the sensitivity analysis of the model toward its parameter variations showed that θ s and τ determine the greatest variability of the travel times even with relatively small variations the validation of the model performed on four large soil columns gave very satisfactory results with a really good agreement between the measured and simulated solute concentrations the comparison with the travel times obtained using hydrus 1d model which represents our benchmark reference gave very good results with high correlation coefficients small mean absolute errors and small percent bias finally the application at valle telesina extent shown how the model could be used to interpret the different responses of the soils given a user defined area depth land use and crop management in general for the small computational demand and number of parameters we can state that tfm ext met our goals in this view the tfm ext model was integrated as an operative tool for the groundwater vulnerability assessment within the web based geo spatial decision support system landsupport www landsupport eu which is developed under h2020 project landsupport

4561,the scope of this work is to present a new fast and reliable transfer function model which simulates the spatio temporal distribution of non point source solutes along the unsaturated zone suitable to be used at large scales within a web based decision support system with the assumptions of a a gravity induced water flow b a non reactive solute and c a purely convective flow the model uses the transfer functions i e the travel time tt probability density functions derived from the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity curve k θ the output concentration of a solute is simply the convolution of the transfer functions with the input concentrations to the system a model sensitivity analysis based on monte carlo simulations was carried out showing that saturated water content and the tortuosity parameter τ were the parameters that affected the mean tt more the model was validated against concentration experiments carried out on four large soil columns results were really good for all soils with the best agreement with r2 0 97 rmse 0 11 and me 0 01 moreover the outputs obtained applying the model to 46 soil profiles sampled in the valle telesina in southern italy completely characterised from the hydrological point of view were compared with those obtained from the richard based model hydrus 1d the result of the comparisons gave a very high correlation coefficient above 0 8 a mean absolute error between the two models of around 40 days and a percent bias of 16 finally the application of transfer function model to a large spatial extent is presented to show its possible use for the groundwater vulnerability assessment keywords extended transfer function travel times hydraulic conductivity curve spatial leaching model groundwater vulnerability assessment 1 introduction the effort to combine productivity with more sustainable water and soil resources management is imperative in many policies such as in the united nations sustainable development goals https sustainabledevelopment un org and in the new european green deal strategy https ec europa eu info strategy priorities 2019 2024 european green deal en more specifically the european nitrate directive dir 91 676 eec the pesticide directive dir 2009 128 ec and the water framework directive dir 2000 60 ec state the prioritizing actions to be applied from each eu member state for the protection and the avoidance of deterioration of waters however these policy maker requests do not always correspond to the availability of really operational tools the study of non point source nps chemical contaminants requires a multidisciplinary approach which encompasses hydrology soil science as well as spatial statistics and geographic information systems coppola et al 2013a since they are widespread at local regional and global scales several spatial leaching modelling systems were proposed in recent years in petach et al 1991 leach m was used to simulate the movement of four classes of chemicals through layered soils for pesticide management and for estimating potential leaching hazards zhang et al 1996 combined an index and overlay model i e the drastic model aller 1985 with the process based numerical model hydrus simunek et al 1998 2012 vero et al 2017 also proposed an hydrus based framework which considered existing soil maps meteorological data and different land use to estimate solute time lags at catchment scale the root zone water quality model rzwqm ahuja et al 2000 kumar et al 1999 is a process based agricultural model that can be applied to quantify the effect of nitrate leaching through the vadose zone on the environment pearl geopearl tiktak et al 2002 was used to calculate the leaching potential of pesticides into local surface waters and the regional groundwater considering the soil type land use climate and groundwater depth class for 6405 plots combining the 1d pesticide leaching model pearl with a geographical information system holman et al 2004 proposed the macro emulator a spatially distributed modelling system for predicting pesticide losses to groundwater eventually the user friendly gis based and client server software vulpes based on pelmo leaching model di guardo and finizio 2015 was developed to identify vulnerable areas at regional level however despite their wide use these models fail to be really operational for policy applications being mostly based on desktop solutions often too computational demanding moreover these approaches often fail in the crucial interaction between end users and scientists well defined by the following statement taken by bouma et al 2008 rather than following traditional top down and disciplinary research approaches emphasis is increasingly being placed on interactive interdisciplinary work in communities of practice cops in which scientists work together with various stakeholders and policymakers in a joint learning mode in order to fulfill these requests in the last decade much progress has been accomplished in development of geo spatial decision support systems freely available on the web explicitly accounting for water flow and transport of dissolved contaminants through the vadose zone at different spatio temporal scales terribile et al 2015 these systems allow the so called on the fly modelling in support of the what if scenario procedures in this context the use of high cpu demanding models based on numerical solutions is not advisable e g richards combined with advective dispersion equation therefore the aim of this work is to present the extended transfer function model tfm ext for the estimation of the travel times of the nps which promises to be a fast and reliable tool for the groundwater vulnerability assessment in support of the previously cited directives within the larger spatial decision support system s dss developed for landsupport h2020 project https www landsupport eu the work is organized as follows section 2 presents the rationale behind the need of the tfm ext model section 3 presents i the theory behind the model ii the sensitivity analysis to its parameter variations trough a monte carlo technique iii its validation using four large undisturbed soil columns iv the comparison with the physically based model hydrus 1d and v the application at the valle telesina extent in support of the groundwater vulnerability assessment section 4 describes the valle telesina and the hydraulic properties dataset section 5 reports and discusses the results of the tfm ext testings and comparisons the conclusions of the study are given in section 6 2 rationale behind the development of tfm ext in order to let the interested reader enter in the rationale behind the tfm ext model within a web based s dss we try to do a simple example of a typical problem we would face a regional policy maker should define the zones vulnerable to nitrates and pesticides in a selected region of interest roi in this roi let s suppose of around 50 km2 we distinguish 4 soil polygons with different hydraulic characteristics 6 different land uses different crops 2 climates a part of the roi is uphill and a groundwater table depth variable for each point of the domain besides the spatial variability the policy maker wants also to consider the time evolution of nitrate and pesticide leaching both with past and future scenarios let s consider that again for simplicity the policy maker is only interested in 2 particular years of simulation combining the spatial and temporal variability of the variable considered to give an answer to the policy maker we need to run at most around 400 simulations if we make a further simplification on the groundwater table depth the policy maker though wants a real time answer to his her problem which should also be effective clearly understandable on a dynamic map freely accessible on the web and he she also wants to be able to consider another roi with different crops bigger than the previous one and a longer simulation of 10 years for example in such a case the number of required simulations will increase by orders of magnitude it is important to stress that most of times the end users are not modellists used to play with partial differential equations and possible related problems multiple parameters definition possibility of not convergence of the solutions climatic issues and so on this situation should be absolutely avoided in order to have the widest application of the models in the community overcoming the historical trade off between the research scientific world and the everyday real life applications requiring effective clear and real time answers bouma et al 2008 bouma 2015 is there a model able to help the policy maker considering all the previous needs in a fast and a physically meaning ways giving him her an immediately interpretable answer to his her problems the last is our key science question which we are trying to answer by proposing the tfm ext model to be implemented within a web based spatial decision support system s dss the use of these systems in fact through dedicated full open access platform allows real time responses and the production of scenario analysis by different end users queries they are not simply web gis system but dynamic environments that could address many different issues from forest resources management marano et al 2019 to olive growing manna et al 2020 and more 3 methods tfm ext is based on jury s transfer functions jury 1982 jury and roth 1990 which are defined as the probability density functions of the travel times at a given time and depth transfer functions are widely used in several disciplines such as in catchment hydrology botter et al 2011 rinaldo et al 2011 rigon et al 2016b in population dynamics and demography bongaarts and feeney 2003 and more calabrese and porporato 2015 rigon et al 2016a they allow to compute the output concentration of a solute by simply convolve the transfer functions with the input concentrations to the system in this work the transfer functions are derived from the hydraulic conductivity functions defined for each layer of the unsaturated zone starting from the approach reported in scotter and ross 1994 other simplified models based for example on the estimation of the unsaturated vertical subsurface travel time e g lee and casey 2005 fenton et al 2011 sousa et al 2013 szymkiewicz et al 2018 2019 despite being very effective don t compute the output solute flux concentration in time and depth as we can do using the transfer functions it is important to stress that tfm ext is not intended to describe in details local scale transport behaviour but as already reported in section 3 it was thought to fulfil the following objectives to integrate a simplified statistical approach with physically based hydrological parameters to be valid for large scale applications but still keeping a physical meaning to be easy to interpret 3 1 model description according to the jury s transfer function model tfm ext computes the output solute flux concentration c z z t ml 3 at a given depth z and a given time t as follows 1 c z z t 0 t c o 0 t f f z t t dt where c 0 t ml 3 is the solute concentration at the surface t is a dummy variable and f f z t is the travel times probability density function tt pdf for a travel distance z conditional to time t in this study a time invariant form of the tt pdf was assumed since the solution of the water budget within the specific control volume is a key point to apply the time variant theory e g botter et al 2011 rinaldo et al 2011 harman 2015 rigon et al 2016b if for simplicity we consider a simple bucket model with a linear reservoir one for each soil layer we have as a minimum 2 parameters to be defined i e to be calibrated after the previous discussion made in section 2 on the spatio temporal variability of our policy maker request adding parameters to be calibrated and ordinary differential equations to be solved would not be an easy task for our problem the situation is even worse if we consider solving richards equation which would be actually required to have the correct solutions of the water budget at this scale of interest according to scotter and ross 1994 tfm ext derives the tt pdfs from the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ with the assumptions of a a gravity induced water flow b a conservative and nonreactive solute and c a purely convective flow as follows 2 f f z t 1 q dk θ dt where f f z t t 1 is the travel time pdf q lt 1 is the steady state flow rate k θ lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity function and θ is the water content the steady state flow rate q can easily be derived from a water budget at the control volume considering constant input fluxes e g constant mean daily net precipitation at the surface boundary for a given steady state flow rate q eq 2 allows to derive the tt pdf for each horizon of soil profile starting from the corresponding k θ curve the hydraulic conductivity function was assumed to be described by the van genucthen mualem vgm equations van genuchten 1980 3 k θ k 0 s e τ 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 4 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where s e is effective saturation h l is the pressure head α l 1 is related to the inverse of the air entry pressure head n and m are shape parameters with the constrain that m 1 1 n θ θ r and θ s are the actual the residual and the saturated water contents respectively k 0 lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity at θ θ s and τ is a parameter which accounts for the dependence of the tortuosity and the correlation factors on the water content the time derivative of the hydraulic conductivity function according to eq 2 is reported in appendix a k θ can be made varying with time which is actually the travel time and not the clock time with some simple variable substitutions we could also reverse the concept i e we can look at the travel time variation related to the variation of water content and thus of the hydraulic conductivity some considerations about the hydraulic conductivity function help to better understand the involved transport processes in particular in fig 1 θ is the actual water content induced in the soil by q thus assuming a unit gradient q k θ and dq d θ identifies the largest pore pathway where the maximum velocity is reached the pores corresponding to θ θ are not involved in the water flow and thus are not accounted in eq 2 once the tt pdf is derived for each horizon the solute transport along the whole soil profile requires an additional hypothesis on the correlation among travel times in the different horizons hamlen and kachanoski 1992 we assume that the travel times of a solute particle in one soil horizon are uncorrelated to the travel times to the other soil horizons in this case the entire soil profile can be described by the first and second moments i e the mean and the variance of the breakthrough curve c z z t hamlen and kachanoski 1992 and can be computed as follows 5 e z t i 1 m e i z t 6 var z t i 1 m var i z t where e z t and var z t are the mean and the variance of the travel times to depth z m is the number of the soil horizon and e i z t and var i z t are the mean and variance on the i th horizon respectively in particular the mean and the variance of the travel times are calculated according to leij and dane 1991 as follows 7 m i n z t 0 t n 1 c z z t dt 0 1 c z z t dt where n is the order of the moment i e 1 for the mean e i z t and 2 for the variance var i z t and c z z t is the concentration of the solute at the time t and depth z in the present study the upper limit of the moment integrals was bounded considering the time t at which 98 of the total input mass injected at the surface was recovered at the investigated depth z in this way the possible long tail of the travel time distributions didn t affect the moment computations avoiding uncertainties in the numerical calculation of the integrals let s assume now that we are interested in transport to depths greater than the soil depth for which the tfm ext has been developed e g below the soil profile till the groundwater table level let s define z the depth to which we have all the information on the hydraulic parameters l the depth of interest where l is greater than z between z and l the properties governing the transport are unknown to extend the process till l we used the generalized transfer function gtf proposed by zhang 2000 which assumed a lognormal form for the travel times distribution expressed as follows 8 f f l t 1 2 π 0 5 σ l t t exp ln t μ l t 2 2 σ l t 2 where μ l t and σ l t are the moments of the ln t at the depth l they can be obtained by inverting the following relations with the mean and the variance of the travel times at depth l 9 e l t exp μ l t σ l t 2 2 10 var l t exp 2 μ l t σ l t 2 exp σ l t 2 1 where according the gtf e l t and var l t are assumed to scale with depth between z and l as follows 11 e l t e z t l z λ 1 12 var l t var z t l z 2 λ 2 λ 1 and λ 2 are the parameters that account for the propagation of the travel time moments which allow to classify the transport process according to the difference λ 1 λ 2 i if λ 1 λ 2 0 the process is stochastic convective ii if λ 1 λ 2 0 the process is scale dependent iii if λ 1 λ 2 0 5 the model is convective dispersive zhang 2000 since we are considering uncorrelated travel times between layers then λ 1 λ 2 0 5 and the process is convective dispersive jury 1982 jury and roth 1990 in summary for each soil horizon between the surface and z where we assume to know all the hydraulic parameters we can calculate the tt pdf through the eq 2 between z and l we assume a lognormal form of the tt pdf according to the gtf whose parameters are computed from the mean and the variance of the travel times at depth z eqs 9 and 10 which are scaled with the power of the ratio of z and l according to eqs 11 and 12 3 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity of the proposed tfm ext model to the variation of the parameters θ r θ s α n k 0 τ was tested using the dataset of the measured hydraulic properties of the soils of the valle telesina site fully described in section 4 firstly the correlation matrix was computed and the cumulative distribution function cdf was derived for θ r θ s α n k 0 τ carsel and parrish 1988 where the normality was directly obtained the normal gaussian distribution was adopted otherwise a transformation was applied to achieve normality in particular three transformed normal distributions known as the johnson system johnson et al 1970 were chosen 1 lognormal ln y ln x 2 log ratio sb y ln x a b x 3 hyperbolic arcsine su y sinh 1 u ln u 1 u 2 1 2 where x is the untransformed parameter a and b are the upper and lower bounds of the investigated parameter and u x a b a in order to choose the best fitting distribution for each parameter the kolmogorov smirnov test was used then to test the model sensitivity a monte carlo approach was used to generate n sets of realizations of the investigated parameters two cases were considered a all parameters as correlated and b all the parameters as not correlated smith and diekkrüger 1996 coppola et al 2009 in the case of correlated parameters the random fields were obtained with a monte carlo procedure from the correlated multivariate normal distribution by generating a vector r n of independent standard normal deviates and then applying a linear transformation of the form x μ lr n where μ is the vector of means and l is the lower triangular matrix derived from the symmetric covariance matrix v ll t decomposed by cholesky factorization according to carsel and parrish 1988 to help the interpretation of the results of the sensitivity analysis the relative importance index toward the variance ri p of the travel times paleologos and lerche 1999 avanidou and paleologos 2002 and the relative deviation method rd hamby 1995 were computed in particular the first was computed as follows 13 ri p σ t p 2 p 1 p σ t p 2 where p is the p th parameter we are considering and σ t p 2 is the variance of the travel times obtained varying the p th parameter the rd was computed as 14 rd σ t p μ t p this index measures the amount of variability in the model output while varying each input parameter one at a time according to its probability density function and it is similar to a coefficient of variation eventually the model sensitivity toward the variation of the steady state input flux was tested while keeping the investigated parameters fixed to their mean 3 3 soil columns validation the validation of the model was performed by using data from previously conducted experiments on large undisturbed soil columns between 70 and 120 cm high 40 cm in diameter as detailed reported in coppola et al 2004 the columns as represented in fig 2 were fed by means of a tension infiltrometer hydraulically connected to a mariotte bottle the steady state flow rates used during the experiments were 130 cm d 1 for column p1 100 cm d 1 for column p3 200 cm d 1 for column p4 and 35 cm d 1 for column p5 double wire time domain reflectometry tdr probes were inserted at different depths to monitor water content and solute resident concentrations during water infiltration and solute transport experiments the parameters of the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions of the columns reported in table 1 were obtained by solving an inverse problem of parameter estimation the solute resident concentrations cr were derived from transmission line tdr probe impedance measurements for further details on the experimental methodology the interested reader can refer to coppola et al 2004 the columns belonging to four different soils were selected as test cases for the present work whose texture organic matter content and hydraulic parameters are reported in table 1 3 4 hydrus 1d comparison the model hydrus 1d simunek et al 2016 was chosen for a comparison of the results of the tfm ext obtained for a large spatial scale application hydrus 1d numerically solves the richards equation for variably saturated water flow and advection dispersion type equations for solute transport the flow equation incorporates a sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots see table 2 for for each soil profile of the valle telesina the following vegetation and upper boundary conditions were considered as regards hydrus 1d we considered 3 years 2002 2004 of variable precipitation and reference evapotranspiration from the historical dataset the initial conditions were set with a pressure head equal 100 cm while the lower boundary conditions were set to the free drainage and the zero concentration gradient the hydraulic conductivity curve was assumed to be described by the vgm model for the solute transport the equilibrium model was used and only one non reactive solute was considered which was injected the first day of the simulation with a value of 43 5 mmol l 1 the dispersivity varied between 2 4 and 12 8 cm for around forty soil samples it was measured carrying out inflow outflow experiments with the procedure described in coppola et al 2011 while for the remaining soil horizons we set the value according to similar textural classes 150 nodes for each profile 1 cm spacing were considered the root water uptake model was chosen the one proposed by feddes et al 1978 with no solute stress where the root parameters were set to literature values of pasture accordingly leaf area index lai and light extinction coefficient were set for the entire period equal to 2 m2 m 2 and 0 39 respectively as regards tfm ext to obtain the constant flux q eq 2 1 we considered 3 years 2002 2004 of variable precipitation and reference evapotranspiration from the historical dataset 2 we simulated using the fao model allen et al 1998 the actual evapotranspiration considering the crop and water stress coefficients 3 we cumulated the annual volumes and computed the constant mean daily net precipitation despite there were really small difference in the cumulated annual volumes of actual evapotranspiration computed by the two models less than 30 mm year 1 they were considered negligible since they didn t affect significantly the mean daily net precipitation on the breakthrough curves obtained at the soil profile depth i e 150 cm the mean and the variance of the travel times were calculated according to eq 7 and compared to those obtained with the tfm ext 3 5 tfm ext application at a large spatial extent as stated in the introduction and in section 2 tfm ext was conceived to be implemented in the s dss to predict in real time nps travel times therefore we present a particular application to the valle telesina case study supposing to be interested to evaluate the filtering capacity of the soils at a fixed groundwater depth of 3 meters the scope is to better highlight the potentiality of the model for the policy makers in support of the definition of the vulnerable areas the inputs for the spatial application are for the user defined area i the depth of interest ii the soil types iii the climate iv the land uses and v the crop managements the full characterization of soil layers to 3 meters depth was not available but only till 1 5 m as described in section 4 the climate was considered spatially variable the land use considered for the entire valley was the alpha alpha fertilized with a non reactive solute of 0 65 mmol l 1 4 study case 4 1 study site the valle telesina site located in southern italy is a 200 km2 area with five different landscape systems limestone mountains with volcanic ash deposits at the surface hills comprised of marl arenaceous flysch pediment plain comprised of colluvium material from the slope fan of the limestone reliefs ancient alluvial terraces and the actual alluvial plain such complexity is echoed in the 60 soil typological units which were aggregated into 46 soil mapping units as shown in fig 3 the climate is typically mediterranean characterized by warm dry summers and cool mild winters with a mean annual rainfall of around 1000 mm mainly distributed between autumn and winter and a mean annual temperature of around 15 c alfieri et al 2019 4 2 hydraulic properties dataset in each representative profile of the soil mapping units undisturbed soil samples were collected from the horizons using cylindrical steel samplers 8 5 cm diameter and 12 0 cm high in the laboratory the samples were saturated by slowly wetting from the bottom in order to remove all the air entrapped in the soil the maximum water content θ 0 was gravimetrically determined and the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured by a falling head permeameter reynolds and elrick 2002 then the wind method arya 2002 was applied to simultaneously determine the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions by subjecting the soil samples to an evaporation process after sealing the bottom surface to prevent drainage during the evaporation process at appropriate pre set time intervals the weight of the whole sample and the pressure head at three different depths were measured an iterative procedure was applied for estimating the water retention curve from these measurements then the instantaneous profile method was applied to determine the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity θ r θ s α and n parameters in eq 4 were derived by fitting the soil water retention data under the restriction m l l n τ and k 0 parameters were derived by fitting the hydraulic conductivity data to eq 3 details of the tests and overall calculation procedures are described in basile et al 2012 the parameters obtained in the laboratory were then scaled to better reproduce the field behaviour by following the procedure suggested by basile et al 2003a 2006 finally for the few soils having considerable stone content a correction of θ s and k s to take into account the stoniness was applied coppola et al 2013b 5 results and discussion this section describes and discusses the results of i the tfm ext model sensitivity analysis ii the model validation against measured data in large soil columns iii the comparison of the results obtained with tfm ext and hydrus 1d model and iv the application to the valle telesina case study 5 1 sensitivity analysis first for each parameter the appropriate theoretical cdf was derived table 3 reports the upper a and lower b limits of variation which were inferred from the dataset the type of transformation applied the mean the standard deviation the coefficient of variation cv of the original parameter and the value of the minimum deviation d between the empirical and the fitted cdfs according to the kolomogorov smirnoff test while θ r was already normally distributed and thus no transformation was applied for θ s and α the best transformation was the johnson hyperbolic arcsine su the johnson log ratio transformation sb was chosen for n and τ and eventually the lognormal distribution for k 0 the monte carlo procedure allowed to perform the model sensitivity analysis in fig 5 only the results of the uncorrelated case are shown since the parameters shown a small correlation from the barplot of the ri toward the variance it is possible to infer some useful information θ s and τ are responsible for 32 and 60 of the travel times variance respectively therefore the tfm ext model is mostly sensitive to these parameters on the contrary θ r variability showed no influence at all while α n and k 0 showed only a small relative importance 1 3 4 the θ s and τ also show the biggest rd with 0 25 and 0 50 values respectively i e the variability in the travel times due to the variation of the two parameters is high confirming the high sensitivity of the model to those parameters while the high relative importance of θ s was somehow expected since its influence on the flow and transport processes the high ri of τ and the small ri of k 0 is interesting τ is usually regarded as an empirical calibration parameter the explanation may be found by looking at the impact of these parameters on the shape of the hydraulic conductivity curve in fig 1 θ s and k s shift the curve along the θ and k axis respectively while the parameter τ controls the slope of the curve for given θ s and τ the variation of k s simply induces a relatively small shift of the curve on the k axis and an elongation of the vertical part of the curve close to saturation overall the change in the k s may produce significant effects on the travel time pdf only for high top boundary fluxes thus bringing soil water content close to saturation in this sense even a high cv as observed for the k s may only have limited effects on the variability of the travel time pdf by contrast the same variation in the water content completely modifies the position of the hydraulic conductivity curve in the k θ plane with significant effects on the derivative of the k θ and thus on the size of the pores involved in the transport at a given top boundary flux in turn this behavior significantly affects the variability of the travel time pdf similar conclusions can be drawn for the parameter τ with the additional effect of a very high cv which has itself consequences on the variability of the travel time pdf this is particularly clear in fig 4 where as an example the effect of the variability of τ on the hydraulic conductivity curve left panel and consequently on the dimensionless flux concentration i e the travel time cdf right panel is shown especially in the first part of the curves e g 20 days clear differences in the values of the travel time cdf can be appreciated between the 4 curves the fact that a large cv of an input parameter does not automatically imply large variability in the output has already been discussed in the literature see for example coppola et al 2009 evidently the contribution of a parameter to the output depends not so much on its cv as on the sensitivity of the model to the parameter itself the sensitivity analysis of the tfm ext model with respect to variations in the steady water flux q was also performed the parameters were set to their mean values while q varied between 0 1 and 1 cm d 1 results of the procedure are reported in fig 6 where the blue line represents the evolution of the mean travel times and the red line represents the evolution of the variance of the travel times both moments showed the same behaviour they decreased sharply till a certain q value around 0 3 cm d 1 and then tended to an asymptotic value of around 45 days and 3000 d2 for the mean and variance respectively fig 1 allows to interpret these results as follows as soon as q increases more pores contribute to the flow and reduces indeed the mean travel times till a certain value after this value all the porous space is involved in the flow process till the upper limit of complete saturation θ θ s thus poorly contributing to both mean and variance tt in fact as soon as q increases even a relatively large variation in its value determines a small variation in θ till the upper limit θ s after which the system produces runoff q k s this is true and holds since the transport in the soil column is considered vertical towards the groundwater if other mechanisms of runoff generation are considered such as shallow subsurface flow or surface runoff then an increase in q would not necessarily decrease the variability in the travel times 5 2 soil columns validation fig 7 shows the results of the validation of the tfm ext for the four soil columns chosen the dimensionless breakthrough curves measured black dots and simulated red lines were compared and some goodness of fit indices were computed in general we can observe that the model performs quite well for all the four cases with the best agreement obtained for the p5 column where the r2 0 97 the rmse 0 11 and the me is 0 01 and the less accurate obtained for the p3 column that still showed a r2 0 88 the rmse 0 22 and the me 0 16 as reported for each graph in the figure these results are really promising since we have to keep in mind that no parameter of the tfm ext was calibrated overall we recognize that the three different shapes of breakthrough curves are well reproduced by the tfm ext model p1 and p4 columns show a similar behaviour with an early response and a breakthrough time of around 5 h 0 2 days p3 column shows an overestimation of solute concentration respect to the measured one still showing a breakthrough time of around 5 h 0 2 days p5 column displays a s shaped breakthrough curve which is slightly smoother according to the model with a later breakthrough time of around 12 h 0 45 days despite its important assumptions on the steady state input flux tfm ext through these validation versus real data from large undisturbed soil columns proved to be robust in reproducing the breakthrough curves for different layered soils with no calibration of any parameter required other validations at field scale in layered soils would not have been feasible at all 5 3 hydrus 1d comparison the moments of the breakthrough curves obtained applying the tfm ext and hydrus1d at the same soil depth of 150 cm were finally compared for all the soil polygons of the valle telesina as described in section 3 4 results of the application are shown in the scatter plot in fig 8 where the black points represent the mean travel times the black line represents the regression line and the red dashed line represents the bisector it is immediately clear that there was a really good agreement between the two models with a correlation coefficient of 0 83 a mean absolute error of around 40 days and a percent bias of 15 8 the regression line appears to be almost parallel to the bisector coefficient of 1 06 with an intercept of 29 3 days the maximum hydrus 1d overestimation was obtained for the soil profile id p32 where the travel times were 199 days using hydrus 1d and of 109 using the tfm ext the higher tt in hydrus 1d were determined by high k s values which for the lower horizon was around 430 cm d 1 the variable upper boundary condition determined the soil to be very wet only for short period during rainy events while remaining rather dry for a longer period thus leading to a slower response of hydrus 1d with respect to tfm ext further tests to assess the goodness of the assumption of a log normal distribution against the use of real data were conducted we saw that for a greater depth 4 m and the same flux 0 174 cm day a loamy sand showed a mean travel time of 172 days while a clay soil showed a mean travel time of 633 days also in these cases we obtained good agreements with hydrus results in line with the previous outcomes these results are positively surprising and further confirm that the steady state hypothesis underlying the tfm ext model holds true finally since one of the key points of the proposed model was to be fast besides being effective from the computational point of view the run time for a single soil profile for hydrus is between of 3 s and 2 min while tfm ext took around 1 2 s to process all the 46 soil profiles 5 4 valle telesina spatial application the spatial application of the tfm ext to the valle telesina case study is shown in fig 9 as reported in section 3 the depth of simulation was 3 m for all the soils for all profiles the mean annual precipitation was equal to 795 mm yr 1 and the reference et was equal to 950 mm yr 1 the mean net precipitation varied between 0 112 cm d 1 and 0 181 cm d 1 408 mm yr 1 and 660 mm yr 1 this application is particularly interesting since it allows to compare the different dynamics determined by the multiple soil characteristics and input fluxes being equals the depth and the land use the mean travel times are categorized in ten intervals from 132 red to 712 green days it is worth noticing that around the 40 of the soil units coloured in light green to dark green in the map have mean travel times above 365 days these are mainly located on the hills and on the upper part of the mountains above the 300 m a s l given the slow response to the solute injection these areas shown a good filtering capacity and therefore could be classified as less vulnerable to possible contaminations compared to the other some soil units present low mean tt in the interval 132 248 days red spots on the mountains and the alluvial plain the red spots on the mountains belong to the same types of soils that according to the usda are classified as lithic and typic hapludands this is not surprising because these soils showing andic features as often mentioned in literature have distinct hydraulic properties namely high hydraulic conductivity in wet conditions similar to sandy soils and high water retention capacity similar to clay soils terribile et al 2018 bartoli et al 2007 basile et al 2003b therefore since the tfm ext model is strongly based on the hydraulic conductivity curve and not on the water retention curve the former prevails and determines the fast tt of soils showing andic features the other red spots in the alluvial plain correspond to the soils that are formed on alluvial deposits and classified as fluvic cambisols with loamy texture because these soils are at the beginning of their pedogenesis they have a moderately developed soil structure with poor macroporosity and connectivity terribile et al 2011 these pedological features correspond to low values of k s and high values of τ thus justifying the lower mean travel times 6 conclusion the purpose of this study was to present the tfm ext for the estimation of solute travel times to a certain fixed depth which deploy a simplified statistical approach based on the transfer functions approach integrated by soil s physical properties in the broad array of leaching models tfm ext was conceived to require small computational efforts while being physically based in fact the main reason behind the model was the need to have a fast and effective tool for real time on line simulations required by the new frontier of the web based decision support systems the input soil type the climate the land use and the crop management are spatially available and real time overlapped to obtain possible infinite combinations and model runs on which to evaluate the nps travel times according to tfm ext it is possible to derive the travel times pdf based on the hydraulic conductivity function and characteristic of each layer of the soil moreover the model extends the transport process to the generic depth z where information on the hydraulic properties couldn t be available making the assumption of a lognormal travel time pdf whose parameters are scaled according to the generalized transfer function model the sensitivity analysis of the model toward its parameter variations showed that θ s and τ determine the greatest variability of the travel times even with relatively small variations the validation of the model performed on four large soil columns gave very satisfactory results with a really good agreement between the measured and simulated solute concentrations the comparison with the travel times obtained using hydrus 1d model which represents our benchmark reference gave very good results with high correlation coefficients small mean absolute errors and small percent bias finally the application at valle telesina extent shown how the model could be used to interpret the different responses of the soils given a user defined area depth land use and crop management in general for the small computational demand and number of parameters we can state that tfm ext met our goals in this view the tfm ext model was integrated as an operative tool for the groundwater vulnerability assessment within the web based geo spatial decision support system landsupport www landsupport eu which is developed under h2020 project landsupport

salt lakes in qaidam basin li 1994 in order to concentrate brine and extract lithium and boron resources the water body of da qaidam lake is divided into many small evaporating ponds the salinity of the lake water at different evaporation stages represents the different evolution stages of the lake hence da qaidam lake water is a natural laboratory for studying the material source such as lithium and potassium and mineralization process and evolution process of salt lake the salt lake was mainly recharged by deep groundwater mainly in form of hydrothermal spring and shallow groundwater river water and precipitation xiao et al 1992 the deep groundwater usually contains a high content of lithium and boron compared to those other water endmembers therefore lithium and boron in the lake playas and brine sediments were considered predominantly derived from groundwater discharge xiao et al 1994 the lithium and boron enriched hot spring water at dakan daban mountain mt dakan daban has been continuously flowing into the lake basin long term groundwater loadings and intensive evaporation condition lead to the high concentration of lithium and boron in the lake water and high grade lithium ore formation at lakebed in the northeast of the lake basin through previous studies have revealed the groundwater is the main sources of lithium and boron for the lake water the studies to quantify the groundwater discharge from different origins and the derived lithium and boron loadings still lack lacustrine groundwater discharge lgd is defined as any and all flows of groundwater from the lakebed to the lake regardless of its driving forces and compositions and is sometimes termed groundwater influx or groundwater exfiltration lewandowski et al 2013 lgd is an analogue to submarine groundwater discharge in coastal environments but mainly controlled by inland hydraulic gradient rather than tide and wave pumping therefore lgd comprises of negligible recirculated component lgd is an important component in water balances of some lakes meinikmann et al 2013 even if its contribution to the water balances is small it might be important to chemical balances since chemical concentrations in groundwater are often much higher than in other components of the water balance and in the lake water itself luo et al 2018a 2018b the methods to estimate the lgd include water budget analysis numerical models directly measurement by seepage meters and natural tracers such as radioactive isotopes kiro et al 2017 2015 kong et al 2019 luo et al 2017b 2016 the studies of lgd and the associated chemical loadings have been widely investigated in the past decades kiro et al 2017 kong et al 2019 luo et al 2018a 2017b 2018b however studies on deep and shallow lgd and derived chemical loadings in mega brine lakes such as da qaidam lake are very limited radium isotopes are ideal tracers to studies the groundwater and surface interaction in the brine lakes as radium has high mobility and low affinity to the aquifer grains in the saline environments there are four naturally occurring radium isotopes namely 226ra t1 2 1600 y 228ra t1 2 5 75 y 224ra t1 2 3 66 d and 223ra t1

precipitate with over saturated baso4 srso4 and caso4 rosenberg et al 2011a 2011b 2013 2014 the co precipitation degree of radium isotopes can be used to infer the degree of solute attenuation in the brine lakes kiro et al 2012 luo et al 2018a comparably conservative tracers such as cl li and b3 in the brine water are usually not saturated thus the brine lakes or ponds of different evaporating stages in da qadam lake are ideal for the investigating of co precipitation such as radium isotopes and enrichment processes of lithium and boron in this study li and b3 contents and ra isotopic activities of hydrothermal groundwater shallow groundwater river water and lake water around da qaidam lake were systematically investigated in order to decipher the enrichment lithium and boron in the brine lakes of different evaporative stages and estimate shallow and deep lgd and the derived li and b3 fluxes the precise partition of deep and shallow groundwater borne li and b3 in brine lakes

and modern salt lake brine have been developed from the headwater to the lake center the lake water is mainly recharged by surface runoff lgd from the lake shore aquifer snow ice melting water in spring seasons and lake basin precipitation during summon seasons and mainly lost via intensive lake area evaporation thus da qaidam lake is the main discharge zone of the basin wang et al 2016 3 methodology 3 1 field works field campaigns were mainly conducted in march and july 2016 around da qaidam lake totally 51 samples from different water were collected including 33 lake water samples of different evaporative stages 5 shallow groundwater and 3 hydrothermal groundwater samples 10 river water samples and 1 rainwater sample shallow groundwater samples mainly were pumped from natural spring outcrops using a peristaltic pump about 10 l rainfall water were collected at the da qaidam town for radium analysis hydrothermal groundwater samples were taken from natural outcrop hot spring hs1 and hs2 and the hydrothermal well at depth of 70 m hs3 with a temperature range of 63 6 64 2 c in wenquangou river water samples were taken from baligou river and datouyanggou river and river confluence zones near the lake fig 2 25 l lake water and river water and 23 l spring water were passed through a 0 45 μm filter cartridge to remove particulates and then through a column containing 15 g manganese fiber to extract radium isotopes luo et al 2014 moore and reid 1973 the flow rate was less than 1 l min 1 to allow complete radium extraction moore and krest 2004 as radium has low adsorption coefficient in brine water recovery test was undertaken for three lake water stations by connecting two mno2 columns in series water samples for major ions were filtered through cellulose acetate membranes with a pore size of 0 45 μm at each station about 2 l water were collected for the analysis of lithium and boron and other trace elements ba sr and si basic physical parameters such as water temperature t and salinity s were measured in situ with portable multiple probes ec300 ysi which has a detection uncertainty less than 0 4 salinity is the measure of number of grams of salt per liter of saline water and expressed as parts per thousand the unit of salinity practical salinity unit or psu g kg is used in this study 3 2 radium desorption experiments the radium desorption and diffusion batch experiments have been conducted to precisely depict the source of radium isotopes derived from river plume desorption when entering the brine environment and sediment fluxes in da qaidam lake the desorption experiment was conducted by adding river sediments into radium free lake water with different salinity the setting was based on the assumption that suspended particles and sediments had the same desorption capacity the brine lake has a maximum salinity of 240 psu we used this maximum salinity lake water to perform the laboratory experiment briefly radium free brine water with a salinity of 240 psu was obtained by passing da qaidam lake water through mno2 fibers and the radium removal efficiency was conducted and yielded to be 99 5 in this study the radium free brine water was then diluted with radium free deionized water to batch solutions each 25 l with salinity of 5 psu 15 psu 25 psu 35 psu 45 psu 65 psu 85 psu 105 psu 125 psu 145 psu 165 psu 185 psu 205 psu and 233 psu respectively afterwards 10 g sediment was added into the batch solutions and the mixtures are also equivalent to a suspended particulate matter concentration of 0 54 kg m 3 in the river water around the lake the mixtures were stirred for 2 h and precipitated for 1 h statically the supernatant was filtered with a 0 45 μm cartridge and was passed through the mno2 fiber slowly to extract radium the radium activity was measured intermediately by radecc to avoid significant decay loss the measured radium represents the radium derived from suspended particulate matter desorption under different salinity 3 3 chemical analysis 3 3 1 major ion and trace element analysis all the major ions were measured in the analysis department of qinghai institute of salt lakes chinese academy of sciences isl cas with the methods as described in previous studies kong et al 2019 the brine water and hydrothermal groundwater were diluted 100 times before the analysis specifically cl was titrated by agno3 hco3 and co3 2 were titrated by hcl so4 2 was measured by baso4 heterometric titration xiao et al 1992 k and na were analyzed by flame photometer with an error less than 3 5 ca2 and mg2 were measured by edta titration method with an error less than 0 3 the analytical precision for major ions is better than 2 analysis of boron b dissolved silica dsi strontium sr and barium ba were performed in the isl cas using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes with a precision of 10 analysis of lithium content were performed at the clean room class 100 in the state key laboratory of loess and quaternary institute of earth environment chinese academy of sciences using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms with a precision of 5 3 3 2 ra isotopes analyses short lived radium isotopes were measured with a radium delayed coincidence counter radecc moore 2008 moore and arnold 1996 mno2 fibers were washed with deionized water to remove salt residue before the measurement excess moisture of the fiber was removed by compressing air to allow weight ratios of water content to fibers to be 0 5 1 the measurement procedures of short lived radium isotopes 224ra and 223ra can be fully referred to as previous studies kong et al 2019 luo et al 2014 moore 2008 the uncertainties of 223ra and 224ra measurements were calculated to be 3 5 and 8 4 with the equations by garcia solsona et al 2008 after short lived radium isotope measurement long lived 226ra and 228ra in the fiber were measured with gamma spectrometry gmx45p4 ortec as described in previous studies moore 1984 wang et al 2014 the preconditioning and measuring processes of 226ra and 228ra have been fully described in previous studies kong et al 2019 the uncertainties of 226ra and 228ra were 0 1 1 97 and 0 1 5 12 respectively 4 results 4 1 geochemical result the results of major ions salinity and lithium in different water endmembers are shown in table s1 the salinity of the salt lake water of different evaporative stages ranges from 1 9 0 2 to 240 4 0 2 psu spatially the salinity is lower along the shoreline with the lowest at the river plume zones and increases towards the lake center indicating the influence of river water and groundwater input concentrations of major ions and trace elements in different water endmembers of da qaidam lake are shown in table s1 and the relations of major ions versus cl are shown in fig 3 generally concentrations of na k cl so4 2 hco3 li and b3 in lake water are much higher than those in hydrothermal groundwater and river water the concentrations of mg2 ca2 sr and ba2 are highest in lake water followed by shallow groundwater and river water and then by hydrothermal groundwater notably concentrations of si in hydrothermal groundwater are significantly high compared to shallow groundwater and river water and is overall higher than lake water fig 3h the high temperature and pressure in the hydrothermal systems favors the interaction between fluid and rocks as a result silica is prone to be dissolved or weathered from bedrock or aquifer media leading to much high silica concentrations in hydrothermal groundwater chen et al 2020 in the lake water except for sr si ba2 and no3 other major ions and trace elements are all well correlated with cl fig 3g h k c suggesting that lake water geochemistry are mainly influenced by the evaporation process spatially most major ions and trace element show similar distribution to that of cl lower near the shoreline and increasing towards the lake center but ca2 and ba2 show inverse pattern higher near the shoreline and decreasing towards the lake center this phenomenon is mainly ascribed to the precipitation of ca2 and ba2 mineral due to over saturation correlation of major ion versus cl for all the groundwater samples are closely aligned on the lake water evaporation line fig 3a b i j indicating groundwater geochemistry is mainly subject to evaporating process hydro geochemistry characteristics of different water endmembers are shown in the piper diagram fig 4 generally the lake water and hydrothermal groundwater belong to na cl type blue circles in fig 4 some river plume water r6 r7 r8 and r9 are na cl type indicating the influence of brine lake water shallow groundwater and part of inland river water are of mixing type fig 4 4 2 lithium and boron concentration the dissolved li concentrations li and dissolved b3 concentrations b in different water endmembers are listed in table s1 in the groundwater li ranges from 0 003 m moll 1 to 0 5 m moll 1 with an average of 0 2 m moll 1 and b from 0 03 m moll 1 to 3 9 m moll 1 in the groundwater with an average of 1 4 m moll 1 much higher li and b were observed in hydrothermal groundwater compared to shallow groundwater li and b of natural outcrop hydrothermal groundwater are greater than that of deep hydrothermal water which could be ascribed to the dissolution along with the groundwater flow path in the river water li and b have a much low concentration ranges of 0 003 0 1 m mol l 1 and 0 1 0 6 m mol l 1 respectively both constituents exhibit significantly high values compared to most other river worldwide huh et al 1998 li and b in the rainwater snow smelting water is much more depleted about 0 14 1 15 μmol l 1 and 46 25 20 35 μmol l 1 respectively in the lake water li ranges from 0 1 m mol l 1 to 38 0 m mol l 1 with an average of 6 6 m moll 1 and b from 3 7 m mol l 1 to 202 3 m mol l 1 with an average of 31 7 m mol l 1 notably boron exhibits significantly high values compared to most other salt lakes and brines worldwide liu et al 2000 uuml et al 2013 wei et al 2014 li has a positive correlation with b in the brine lake fig 5 suggesting that both constituents were under saturated along with the increase of evaporation stages spatially li and b have a low value at river plume zones and increase from the nearshore to lake center indicating the influence of lgd and river discharge the clay minerals are mainly illite and chlorite with a small portion of montmorillonite in sediment of da qaidam lake li has very high content in the sediment compared to that in the continental crust teng et al 2004 ranging from 0 09 to 0 2 mg g 1 while b has a moderate content in the sediment ranging from 3 8 to 17 2 mg g 1 xiao et al 1994 4 3 results of radium isotopes 4 3 1 dissolved radium isotope activities the activities of ra isotopes in different water endmembers are shown in details in table s1 the spatial distributions of 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra in different water endmembers are presented in fig 6 spatially the 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra activities are much higher in the river plume zones with the highest activity at the station of l1 fig 6e h and linearly decrease toward the lake center indicating the influences of riverine input and lgd input luo et al 2017a 2016 peterson et al 2008a generally 223ra and 224ra activities are mainly controlled by lgd input sediment regeneration and particulate desorption leading to radium excesses at the nearshore shallow zones the possibly much longer water residence time in the lake center will also favor the decay loss additionally lowering the two nuclide activities towards the lake center for long lived 226ra and 228ra their activities are mainly subject to desorption at the nearshore sub saline areas and co precipitation and evaporation enrichment at the lake center areas exhibiting relatively steady state condition spatially breier and edmonds 2007 moore 2003 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra activities in groundwater are in the ranges of 1 8 0 1 to 51 1 3 6 26 1 3 to 1924 96 2 20 5 0 03 to 1190 0 1 and 37 3 0 1 to 2404 3 8 dpm 100 l 1 radium activities of groundwater samples were significantly higher than those of lake water and river water the 223ra 224ra and 228ra activities of deep hydrothermal groundwater hs3 are 3 4 times of that natural outcrop hydrothermal groundwater hs2 however 226ra activity shows inverse condition compared to other three nuclides this phenomenon suggested that short lived 223ra 224ra and 228ra were probably subject to decay loss long lived 226ra were subject to the recoil input or production during the groundwater transport luo and jiao 2019 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra activities in river water are in the ranges of 0 3 0 02 to 12 1 0 8 10 8 0 5 to 218 10 9 4 4 0 04 to 89 6 0 1 and 30 3 0 1 to 218 8 0 7 dpm 100 l 1 223ra and 226ra in river water exhibit narrow activity range compared to that of 224ra and 228ra in river water the 223ra 224ra and 228ra activities overall decrease towards headwater streams fig 6a d 223ra 224ra and 228ra activities in river water were larger than those in lake water but lower than groundwater fig 6a d however 226ra activities in the river water were lower than those in lake water 4 3 2 riverine radium desorption as a result of the long term weathering of rocks ra isotopes in the river water mainly exist in dissolved and particular forms before entering the lake under the fresh water environment ra isotopes have strong affinity to the particular matter after emptying into the lakes radium isotopes are prone to desorb when encountering the saline environment key et al 1985 table 1 shows the experiment result of ra activities derived from suspended particulate under different salinity the loading of 223ra from desorption range from 1 1 0 1 to 16 2 0 7 dpm kg 1 respectively the desorption activities of 224ra range from 11 2 0 3 to 319 8 10 1 dpm kg 1 and have the crest value at the salinity of 24 8 psu 104 1 psu and 165 1 psu the desorption activities of 226ra and 228ra range from 54 4 0 1 to 313 6 0 4 dpm kg 1 and from 235 8 0 5 to 733 4 1 3 dpm kg 1 respectively they have a similar desorption pattern and the crest value both at the salinity of 125 8 psu radium desorption capacity overall increase with salinity before salinity of 50 psu this pattern suggests that radium isotopes will be desorbed effectively at the river plumes zones with salinity threshold of 50 psu fig 7 the mass loadings of 224ra and 228ra desorption are overall 1 2 times of 226ra desorption loadings this is because that 224ra and 228ra belong to the 232th decay chain and has much higher activities in the sorbed pool than that of 226ra 5 discussion 5 1 radium sources for the lake water potential sources of radium to the lake water include river water inputs desorption from riverine sediment lgd loadings and sedimentary diffusion the relations between different radium nuclides in different water end members are presented in fig 8 generally positive linear correlations were observed between lognormal concentrations of different nuclides suggesting radium isotopes are regulated by the same predominant process radium activity ratios ar specifically ar 223ra 226ra ar 224ra 226ra ar 224ra 228ra and ar 228ra 226ra can reflect radium sources in the hydrologic and lithological systems the ars of radium nuclides for different water endmembers are shown in table s1 the ars of 228ra to 226ra for lake water was notably close to that of hydrothermal groundwater hs3 and was significantly different from that of river water and shallow groundwater the ar 228ra 226ra of deep hydrothermal groundwater natural outcrop hydrothermal groundwater shallow groundwater and lake water are 2 7 n 1 0 7 n 2 2 4 n 5 and 2 6 n 33 respectively for the lake water 228ra vs 226ra has good positive linear correlation with a slope of 1 89 r2 0 90 n 33 the hydrothermal groundwater and shallow groundwater samples have a very similar ars 228ra 226ra indicating a rather similar diagenesis processes the natural outcrops hydrothermal groundwater hs2 had a significantly lower ar 228ra 226ra compared to that lake water suggesting that natural outcrops hydrothermal groundwater cannot explain the ar 228ra 226ra of lake water deep hydrothermal groundwater and shallow groundwater have approximate ar 228ra 226ra to the lake water indicating these water endmembers are primary lake water radium sources riverine radium loading can be derived from dissolved radium and its desorption portion from particulars when encountering saline environments the major rivers around the lake are the datoyanggou river and baligou river the averaged dissolved 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra activities were 7 8 0 3 180 4 5 9 116 5 0 2 and 353 6 0 6 dpm kg 1 respectively based on the desorption experiment results kong et al 2021 the desorption radium activity can be calculated according to the following equation 1 r a d r a susd c where rasusd dpm kg 1 and c kg m 3 are normalized radium desorption loading from suspended particles and content of suspended particles of river water which is setting to be 0 54 kg m 3 for datoyanggou river and baligou river xue 2001 the desorption radium loadings for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra were estimated to be 0 4 0 1 9 7 0 3 6 3 0 1 and 19 1 0 1 dpm 100l 1 respectively table 1 almost one order of magnitude lower compared to the dissolved riverine radium loadings 223ra 2 1 109 dpm y 1 224ra 3 1 1010 dpm y 1 226ra 7 6 109 dpm y 1 and 228ra 3 9 1010 dpm y 1 sedimentary diffusion rates for radium isotopes were estimated based on sediment tank incubation experiments with a diffusion flux rates jdiff dpm m2 h 1 0 1 4 7 0 1 and 0 3 for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra respectively kong et al 2021 based on the obtained diffusion flux rates radium loadings from sediment diffusion can be calculated as 2 i diff j diff a sed where jdiff is the diffusion flux of radium as aforementioned dpm m 2 h 1 ased is lakebed area m2 the lake area of da qaidam lake sediment is about 35 45 km2 with the parameters the sediment diffusion loadings of 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra are estimated to be 4 0 1010 1 5 1012 3 1 1010 and 9 8 1010 dpm y 1 respectively the sediment diffusion loading is as much as more than 2 times of riverine radium loading since the 226ra and 228ra activities of rainwater is low to 12 7 0 3 and 0 8 0 1 dpm 100l 1 and the annual precipitation of only 90 mm in da qaidam lake region the 226ra and 228ra input from rainwater is estimated to be 5 2 108 dpm y 1 and 3 3 107 dpm y 1 in general radium isotopes of the lake water are mainly sourced from riverine loadings deep hydrothermal groundwater shallow groundwater and sedimentary diffusion with minor to negligible contributions from rainfall 5 2 radium co precipitation in the lake water and saturation index of electrolyte the correlations of radium isotopes versus salinity are shown in details in fig 9 for salinity less than 50 psu radium isotopes increase with salinity and after salinity is large than 170 psu the radium isotopes decrease with salinity in lake water this phenomenon is induced by co precipitation along with the increase of salinity and intensity of evaporation stages to figure out the salinity minimum threshold for the triggering of co precipitation the fitting curves of radium versus salinity for two salinity intervals were obtained and the intersection of the two fitting curves were regarded as the threshold salinity to trigger the co precipitation the results show that the threshold salinity for co precipitation for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra are 58 8 psu 139 2 psu 76 9 psu and 85 2 psu respectively it reveals that different radium isotopes have different threshold values to trigger the co precipitations after the triggering of co precipitation 223ra has very weak correlation r2 0 21 fig 9e with salinity suggesting the negligible co precipitation effect as 223ra has extremely low activities and mass concentration 224ra has moderate positive linear correlation r2 0 48 fig 9f and 226ra and 228ra have significant positive linear correlations r2 0 83 and 0 81 with salinity suggesting the three nuclides are highly influenced by co precipitation as the mass concentrations of 226ra and 228ra are much highly compared to 224ra therefore the triggering thresholds of the long lived radium isotopes are much small compared to that of 224ra fig 9g h electrolyte of the lake water will experience over saturation along with the intensity of evaporative stages mercedes martín et al 2019 in the brine water radium isotopes are prone to co precipitate along with ca ba sr precipitates kiro et al 2013 the saturation index si characterizing whether electrolyte solution is saturated undersatured or supersaturated with respect to the given minerals si can be calculated with the si log10 iap ksp where iap and ksp are ion activation products and the chemical equilibrium constant for the mineral of interests the iap ksp and si of ca ba sr compounds in the lake water is calculated with phreeqc v3 4 barite baso4 si was calculated to be from 0 3 to 2 1 table 2 at different evaporating stages indicating lake water of all evaporative stages are oversaturated with respective to baso4 si of calcite caco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 were calculated to be from 0 55 to 0 9 and from 1 7 to 2 7 in the lake water both under oversaturated condition under all the evaporative stages also saturation indexes of calcite and dolomite are not applicable for samples with salinity large than 170 psu ascribed to the over depletion of co3 2 in the later evaporative stage waters si of celestite of the majority of the lake water samples were native indicating celestite under saturation conditions however two samples l30 and l32 exhibit slight over saturation with si of 0 1 and 0 2 respectively because the two stations located at the south of the lake are under the latest evaporative stages fig 6a d the saturation degree of halite nacl were calculated to be from 0 01 to 5 0 and all under saturated previous studies have demonstrated radium has a high co precipitation capacity with baso4 srso4 caso4 and caso4 2h2o with the co precipitation coefficients of 1 2 rosenberg et al 2011a 296 zhu 2004 800 langmuir and riese 1985 and 0 1 gnanapragasam and lewis 1995 respectively in this study only the saturation of baso4 is observed and is considered to be the dominant mechanism to remove radium isotopes by co precipitation as indicated in fig 9e g radium isotopes increase with salinity when it below the co precipitation threshold salinity and turn to decrease with salinity when it exceeds the threshold salinity however radium isotopes have a positive correlation with ba for lake water in all the evaporative stage further stress that radium is co precipitated with baso4 fig 9d radium co precipitation with baso4 precipitates are also observed in other brine waters and intensively evaporative ponds rosenberg et al 2013 2018 the radium co precipitation with baso4 in the form of ra ba so4 precipitates is an important process to constrain the brine lake hydro geochemical evolution kiro et al 2012 luo et al 2017a 5 3 multi tracer models coupled radium mass balance water budget and tracer buildup multi tracer models consist of mass balance of 226ra buildup model of conservative tracers of li cl and sr and water budget the regional water budget can be written as 3 lg d d l g d s f r p e 0 where lgdd and lgds are the groundwater discharge of deep hydrothermal groundwater d and shallow groundwater s fr is river discharge p is precipitation and e is the evaporation the radium isotopes especially for long lived 226ra and 228ra are highly influenced by the co precipitation the lake stages with salinity greater than 80 psu as aforementioned at the early evaporative stages salinity 80 psu radium isotopes in the lake water increases with salinity indicating negligible co precipitation removals and relatively non steady state at the late evaporative stage co precipitation will be triggered after salinity 80 psu fig 9g h under this occasion the removal of radium isotopes by co precipitation is considered to be balanced by the sources from riverine and lgd loadings thus after the triggering of co precipitation the mass balance equation for the 226ra which is the highest in mass concentration among the four nuclides can be written as 4 lg d d 226 r a d l g d s 226 r a s f r 226 r a r f di f cp 0 where 226radg and 226rag and 226rar are the 226ra activities of deep hydrothermal groundwater d and shallow groundwater s and river water respectively fdi is radium loading from sedimentary diffusion f cp is removal rates of radium by co precipitation differed from radium isotopes whose sources are balanced by the sinks of co precipitation these tracers cl li and sr are subject to build up along with evaporative stages the build up theories of these tracers can be verified by the linear increasing of their concentrations with salinity in all the lake water evaporative fig 3d g the existence of this build up condition is also evidenced by the under saturation of nacl in all lake water evaporative stages the build up model of these tracers can be written as 5 l g d d l i d l g d s l i s f r l i r v δ l i l 6 l g d d c l d l g d s c l s f r c l r v δ c l l 7 l g d d s r d l g d s s r s f r s r r v δ s r l where the subscripts of d s and r denotes the concentrations lithium chloride and strontium of deep hydrothermal groundwater shallow groundwater and river water respectively δlil δcll and δsrl are the buildup concentrations of li cl and sr in the lake water due to increase of evaporative stages and v is volume of lake water to bridge the radium mass balance model and the conservative tracer buildup models the relations of radium versus these build up tracers after the co precipitation threshold salinity are explored and shown in fig 10 a c good negative linear correlations are found between 226ra vs cl r2 0 78 226ra vs li r2 0 41 and 226ra vs sr r2 0 30 with a slope of 79033 42 8 and 15 2 respectively it indicates that removal rates of radium isotopes by co precipitation can be manifested by these tracers build up rates using obtained correlation equations in fig 9a c therefore the build up equations can be rewritten in the forms of radium co precipitations rates 8 l g d d l i d l g d s l i s f r l i r v k ra l i f cp v c ra l i 9 l g d d c l d l g d s c l s f r c l r v k ra c l f cp v c ra c l 10 l g d d s r d l g d s s r s f r s r r v k ra s r f cp v c ra s r where kra cl kra li and kra sr equals 79033 42 8 and 15 2 and cra cl cra li and cra sr equals 201525 83 7 and 18 5 respectively this approach can be effectively used to decipher the co precipitation rates of the brine lake water which is difficult to estimate based on traditional approaches 5 4 lgd and the derived lithium and boron loadings 5 4 1 lgd and radium co precipitation rate estimates the ternary linear equations of 3 4 8 3 4 9 and 3 4 10 are employed to solve the three unknowns lgdd lgds and fcp substituting all given and estimated parameters table 3 into these ternary linear equations lgdd and lgds are estimated to be in the range of 7 5 106 m3 y 1 9 9 106 m3 y 1 and 2 3 107 m3 y 1 2 6 107 m3 y 1 respectively the average of lgdd and lgds are obtained to be 8 8 106 m3 y 1 and 2 4 107 m3 y 1 the lgds is about one order of magnitude larger than that of lgdd indicating that lake water are primary sourced from shallow groundwater rather than deep groundwater the groundwater discharge rates of wenquangou hydrothermal springs entering da qaidam lake are estimated to be 10 0 25 1 l s 1 3 2 7 9 105 m3 y 1 based on continuous observation zhang 1987 and this range is about one magnitude lower than the lgdd in this study this is reasonable as the lake might be recharged by hydrothermal springs at lakebed or from other places previous studies on the groundwater discharge rates at alluvial fan section of baligou a sub catchment with an area about 1 3 of the lake basin is estimated to be 1 9 107 m3 y 1 based on darcy s law wang et al 2016 which is also about 1 3 of the lgds in this study this further stresses the tenability of lgds estimate in this study in the study area the total runoff and precipitation into the lake are 3 7 107 m3 y 1 and 4 1 106 m3 y 1 respectively lgdd and total lgd are about 24 1 20 5 to 27 2 and 91 0 of the river discharge or 11 9 10 1 to 13 5 and 45 0 of the total water input to the lake lgdd is as small as precipitation it is concluded that lgd is dominant component of water input at the da qaidam lake normally lgd plays an important role in delivering constituent to the lake water bodies as groundwater is highly enriched in resource trace elements in the groundwater especially for deep hydrothermal groundwater 226ra removal rate by co precipitation is estimated to be to 6 4 1010 dpm y 1 based on which co precipitation coefficient of the lake is estimated to be 4 7 6 1 y 1 these values are comparable to those of the brine lakes in the desert environments luo et al 2017b intensive evaporation of the brine lakes in the arid environments will highly contribute to the co precipitation processes of radium therefore as a key process for radium behaviors in the brine lakes co precipitation should be taken into account in other similar studies to assess the magnitude of uncertainty of the multi tracer models the sensitivity of estimated lgd to changes in other variables is examined a sensitivity coefficient f is proposed to evaluate this uncertainty according to previous studies langston et al 2013 luo et al 2018b higher f indicates a large uncertainty of the final lgd estimate in this study the uncertainty mainly stems from 226ra li cl and sr measurements in different water endmembers the uncertainty of lgd estimate is mainly derived from uncertainty of 226ra with an uncertainty of 0 1 2 0 li with an uncertainty of about 5 cl with an uncertainty of about 2 and sr with an uncertainty of about 10 in different water endmembers thus the integrated uncertainty of lgd is estimated to be 17 1 19 the lgd of this study is compared to previous studies elsewhere table 4 generally our lgd estimate is significantly lower compared to lgd in other regions the much low estimates could be ascribed to the climate and topographic difference the da qaidam lake is located at the very arid environment in qaidam basin and has a low relief topographic setting around the lakeshore therefore the lgd in this study is much lower than those salt lakes in similar climate of badain jaran desert luo xx as the latter lakes have significant high relief settings and therefore much high lgd 5 4 2 lgd derived li and b loadings with the obtained lgdd and lgds and the lithium and boron concentrations in the shallow and deep hydrothermal groundwater table 3 and fig 11 the lgdd derived and lgds derived lithium loads were estimated to be from 19 4 to 25 8 t y 1 and from 2 7 to 3 0 t y 1 with an average of 22 9 t y 1 and 2 8 t y 1 respectively total lgd derived lithium loading accounts for 79 0 76 8 to 80 8 of total water borne lithium to the lake the lgdd derived lithium load accounts for 88 8 86 6 to 90 5 of total lgd derived lithium load and for 70 2 66 5 to 73 1 of total water borne lithium the lgdd derived and lgds derived boron loads were estimated to be from 315 5 to 419 0 t y 1 and from 102 7 to 113 6 t y 1 with an average of 371 4 t y 1 and 107 7 t y 1 respectively total lgd derived boron load accounts for 77 7 75 8 to 79 2 of total water borne boron lgdd derived boron load accounts for 77 3 73 5 to 80 3 of total lgd derived lithium loads and 60 1 55 8 to 63 6 of total water borne boron although lgdd only accounts very small portion of the total lgd it will deliver disproportionate resource element loadings to the lake water compared to shallow groundwater discharge and riverine loadings this is because the shallow groundwater and river water has much depleted resource element as they are mainly supplied by snow ice melting water and minorly influenced by weathering processes while deep groundwater is subject to intensive rock fluid interactions and therefore significantly enriched in these resource elements nordstrom et al 1989 thus lgd is an important conveyor of deep resource elements to the surface water systems and are vital to for the sustainably exploitation of the resources elements in mega brine lakes it is also suggested that groundwater borne li and b will to some degree ease the intensive exploitation 6 conclusion radium isotopes are systemically investigated in different water endmembers in a mega brine lake da qaidam lake in the qtp multi trace models of radium mass balance water budget and conservative trace buildup models were employed to estimate lgdd and lgds of the da qaidam lake leading to an estimate of 7 5 106 m3 y 1 to 9 9 106 m3 y 1 and 2 3 107 m3 y 1 to 2 6 107 m3 y 1 respectively and the average of lgdd and lgds are 8 8 106 m3 y 1 and 2 4 107 m3 y 1 the radium in the lakes is predominantly controlled by co precipitation with a co precipitation rates of from 4 7 to 6 1 y 1 the lgdd and lgds derived lithium loads were estimated from 19 4 to 25 8 t y 1 and from 2 7 to 3 0 t y 1 respectively and boron loads from 315 5 to 419 0 t y 1 and from 102 7 to 113 6 t y 1 respectively this study implies that although lgdd constitutes a relatively small portion of the brine hydrologic partitioning it predominates the lithium and boron loadings to the salt lake this study presents the first attempt to estimate the lgd and the associated lithium and boron loadings to a large qtp brine lake in china and would be constructive to similar studies in saline lakes in qtp and elsewhere in the world the results of this study are of significance for the conservation of water and reasonably exploitation and utilization of lithium and boron this study demonstrates that

4562,brine lakes are good natural laboratories to investigate groundwater influences on the hydrologic and chemical evolutions in arid environments and the mineralization processes under intensive evaporation lacustrine groundwater discharge lgd is the vital conveyor for the loadings of resource elements in the brine lakes da qaidam lake located in the qaidam basin of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is one of the largest brine lakes for boron and lithium resources in china lithium and boron in the lake are considered to be dominantly sourced from deep hydrothermal groundwater and shallow groundwater but the partitioning of deep and shallow components to the lake and the derived lithium and boron loadings remain unknown lgd derived boron and lithium provide the primary source of the salt lake vitally regulates the formation evolution and mineralization of li and b resources in the brine lake this study performs systematical investigations of radium isotopes 226ra 228ra 224ra and 223ra lithium boron and other hydrogeochemical parameters in different water endmembers around the brine lake the results indicate that radium isotopes are significantly enriched in the hydrothermal groundwater and will be removed by co precipitation with barite precipitates in the lake water the multi tracer models coupled radium bass balance conservative tracer buildup and water budget were deployed to precisely constrain radium co precipitation rates and to quantify the deep and shallow lgd total lgd lgdd lgds and the derived lithium and boron loadings radium co precipitation coefficient is obtained to be 4 7 6 1 y 1 lgdd and total lgd are estimated to be 8 8 106 and 3 3 107 m3 y 1 respectively which account for 11 9 and 57 2 of the total water input lgdd and total lgd derived lithium boron loadings constitute up to 70 2 60 1 and 79 0 77 7 of the total loadings respectively indicating the significance of disproportionate lgdd in delivering resource elements into the brine lake this study presents the first attempt to partition the deep hydrothermal and shallow lgd to a mega the qtp brine lake by multi tracer models and the findings contribute to the understanding of lithium and boron budgets in the brine lakes of the qtp and worldwide keywords radium isotopes lacustrine groundwater discharge lgd lithium and boron resource co precipitation da qaidam lake hydrothermal groundwater 1 introduction lithium is widely used in batteries nuclear industry optoelectronics medical treatment aerospace and other fields and is considered as vital strategic resources energetic metal of the 21st century he et al 2020 elemental boron is a metalloid and is used in ceramics detergents fertilizers and glass more than 80 of the world s total lithium and 25 boron salt production comes from salt lake brine u s geological survey mineral commodity summaries 1995 2009 brine lakes and playas are widely distributed in qaidam basin in the qinghai tibet plateau qtp mineral resource li b mg and k etc are abundant in these brine lakes and playas and serve as fundamental advantageous and strategic resources in china zheng and liu 2010 the boron and lithium contents in the brines of da qaidam salt lake in the north of qaidam basin are 500 800 mgl 1 and 120 190 mgl 1 respectively about 110 180 times and 800 1200 times that of seawater and ranking first among all kinds of salt lakes in qaidam basin li 1994 in order to concentrate brine and extract lithium and boron resources the water body of da qaidam lake is divided into many small evaporating ponds the salinity of the lake water at different evaporation stages represents the different evolution stages of the lake hence da qaidam lake water is a natural laboratory for studying the material source such as lithium and potassium and mineralization process and evolution process of salt lake the salt lake was mainly recharged by deep groundwater mainly in form of hydrothermal spring and shallow groundwater river water and precipitation xiao et al 1992 the deep groundwater usually contains a high content of lithium and boron compared to those other water endmembers therefore lithium and boron in the lake playas and brine sediments were considered predominantly derived from groundwater discharge xiao et al 1994 the lithium and boron enriched hot spring water at dakan daban mountain mt dakan daban has been continuously flowing into the lake basin long term groundwater loadings and intensive evaporation condition lead to the high concentration of lithium and boron in the lake water and high grade lithium ore formation at lakebed in the northeast of the lake basin through previous studies have revealed the groundwater is the main sources of lithium and boron for the lake water the studies to quantify the groundwater discharge from different origins and the derived lithium and boron loadings still lack lacustrine groundwater discharge lgd is defined as any and all flows of groundwater from the lakebed to the lake regardless of its driving forces and compositions and is sometimes termed groundwater influx or groundwater exfiltration lewandowski et al 2013 lgd is an analogue to submarine groundwater discharge in coastal environments but mainly controlled by inland hydraulic gradient rather than tide and wave pumping therefore lgd comprises of negligible recirculated component lgd is an important component in water balances of some lakes meinikmann et al 2013 even if its contribution to the water balances is small it might be important to chemical balances since chemical concentrations in groundwater are often much higher than in other components of the water balance and in the lake water itself luo et al 2018a 2018b the methods to estimate the lgd include water budget analysis numerical models directly measurement by seepage meters and natural tracers such as radioactive isotopes kiro et al 2017 2015 kong et al 2019 luo et al 2017b 2016 the studies of lgd and the associated chemical loadings have been widely investigated in the past decades kiro et al 2017 kong et al 2019 luo et al 2018a 2017b 2018b however studies on deep and shallow lgd and derived chemical loadings in mega brine lakes such as da qaidam lake are very limited radium isotopes are ideal tracers to studies the groundwater and surface interaction in the brine lakes as radium has high mobility and low affinity to the aquifer grains in the saline environments there are four naturally occurring radium isotopes namely 226ra t1 2 1600 y 228ra t1 2 5 75 y 224ra t1 2 3 66 d and 223ra t1 2 11 4 d the four radium nuclides are used to study water mixing processes and circulation in coastal and brine lakeshore aquifers kiro et al 2014 to estimate the water residence time and groundwater discharge in saline environments kim et al 2005 kiro et al 2013 moore 2000 peterson et al 2008b wang and du 2016 in the highly evaporating surface water radium isotopes are also prone to co precipitate with over saturated baso4 srso4 and caso4 rosenberg et al 2011a 2011b 2013 2014 the co precipitation degree of radium isotopes can be used to infer the degree of solute attenuation in the brine lakes kiro et al 2012 luo et al 2018a comparably conservative tracers such as cl li and b3 in the brine water are usually not saturated thus the brine lakes or ponds of different evaporating stages in da qadam lake are ideal for the investigating of co precipitation such as radium isotopes and enrichment processes of lithium and boron in this study li and b3 contents and ra isotopic activities of hydrothermal groundwater shallow groundwater river water and lake water around da qaidam lake were systematically investigated in order to decipher the enrichment lithium and boron in the brine lakes of different evaporative stages and estimate shallow and deep lgd and the derived li and b3 fluxes the precise partition of deep and shallow groundwater borne li and b3 in brine lakes is constructive to the comprehensive evaluation and sustainable exploitation of lithium and boron resources in da qaidam lake and other brine lakes in the qtp and worldwide 2 study area 2 1 geological settings da qaidam lake 37 46 37 55 n 95 02 95 22 e is located in an inter mountain basin on the northeast of the qaidam basin in the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau qtp at an altitude of 3148 m above sea level the lake is surrounded by the mt dakkendaban to the north and the mt luliang to the south and situated in the tectonic belt between qilian block and qaidam block fig 1 the lake basin is mainly controlled by faults with minor fold development and highly influenced by magmatic activity zheng et al 1989 proterozoic sinian cambrian middle and lower ordovician carboniferous permian and triassic distribute around the basin andwith small areas of cretaceous jurassic and tertiary the quaternary sediment is well developed from the piedmont to the center of lake basin consisting of slope alluvium and diluvium and lacustrine formations from the outside to the inside yang 1983 there are outcrops of magmatic rocks in various periods and mesozoic tourmaline granite is the most widely distributed to the northeast of mt dakendaban the granite terrane is widely developed with an area of 2200 km2 song et al 2014 the vein fault zone in mt daken daban mainly consists of da qaidam reverse flushing slip fault and zongwulong mountain thrust faults the wenquan gutter and baligou gutter are developed in the fault zones fig 1 2 2 hydroclimate and hydrogeological settings the average annual temperature and precipitation of the lake areas is 2 4 c and 90 mm respectively rainfall events mainly occur during the monsoon season from may to september the mean annual evaporation is recorded to be 2123 mm http data cma cn the lake area exhibits an irregular crescent shape fig 1 the lake area and depth show significant inter annual and seasonal variations with a maximum depth less than 1 m and a water surface area of 35 45 km2 the lake area is mainly controlled by the westerly circulation and characterized by dry and rainless condition the lake catchment has area of 2130 km2 the lake water mainly belongs to na cl type wang 1998 there is no perennial river recharged to the lake and the main ephemeral rivers namely datouyang river baligou river wenquangou river are distributed in the north of the lake the runoff mainly appears in the high relief headwater catchments and disappears at the low relief quaternary sediments due to intensive groundwater infiltration as the longest river around the lake the baligou river has an annual runoff of 0 50 m3 s 1 and a length of 23 5 km wang et al 2016 the river cuts off at 1 km northeast of the da qaidam town due to high groundwater infiltration rates and then re emerged at the downstream of da qaidam town in the form of two streams which finally empty into the lake datouyang river has an annual runoff of 0 53 m3 s 1 wenquangou river is about 10 km to the northeast of da qaidam lake and has an annual runoff of 0 12 m3 s 1 wang et al 2016 a series of spring with 87 hot springs emerge at the granite gneiss fracture zones the hot spring water temperature is generally 60 70 c the spring water is mainly sourced from snow melt water and bedrock fissure water wang 1998 the lake basin shows typical circular hydrogeological bands under the control of geological structure and sedimentary environments the frozen water bedrock fissure water alluvial proluvial phreatic water subsurface intercrystalline brine and modern salt lake brine have been developed from the headwater to the lake center the lake water is mainly recharged by surface runoff lgd from the lake shore aquifer snow ice melting water in spring seasons and lake basin precipitation during summon seasons and mainly lost via intensive lake area evaporation thus da qaidam lake is the main discharge zone of the basin wang et al 2016 3 methodology 3 1 field works field campaigns were mainly conducted in march and july 2016 around da qaidam lake totally 51 samples from different water were collected including 33 lake water samples of different evaporative stages 5 shallow groundwater and 3 hydrothermal groundwater samples 10 river water samples and 1 rainwater sample shallow groundwater samples mainly were pumped from natural spring outcrops using a peristaltic pump about 10 l rainfall water were collected at the da qaidam town for radium analysis hydrothermal groundwater samples were taken from natural outcrop hot spring hs1 and hs2 and the hydrothermal well at depth of 70 m hs3 with a temperature range of 63 6 64 2 c in wenquangou river water samples were taken from baligou river and datouyanggou river and river confluence zones near the lake fig 2 25 l lake water and river water and 23 l spring water were passed through a 0 45 μm filter cartridge to remove particulates and then through a column containing 15 g manganese fiber to extract radium isotopes luo et al 2014 moore and reid 1973 the flow rate was less than 1 l min 1 to allow complete radium extraction moore and krest 2004 as radium has low adsorption coefficient in brine water recovery test was undertaken for three lake water stations by connecting two mno2 columns in series water samples for major ions were filtered through cellulose acetate membranes with a pore size of 0 45 μm at each station about 2 l water were collected for the analysis of lithium and boron and other trace elements ba sr and si basic physical parameters such as water temperature t and salinity s were measured in situ with portable multiple probes ec300 ysi which has a detection uncertainty less than 0 4 salinity is the measure of number of grams of salt per liter of saline water and expressed as parts per thousand the unit of salinity practical salinity unit or psu g kg is used in this study 3 2 radium desorption experiments the radium desorption and diffusion batch experiments have been conducted to precisely depict the source of radium isotopes derived from river plume desorption when entering the brine environment and sediment fluxes in da qaidam lake the desorption experiment was conducted by adding river sediments into radium free lake water with different salinity the setting was based on the assumption that suspended particles and sediments had the same desorption capacity the brine lake has a maximum salinity of 240 psu we used this maximum salinity lake water to perform the laboratory experiment briefly radium free brine water with a salinity of 240 psu was obtained by passing da qaidam lake water through mno2 fibers and the radium removal efficiency was conducted and yielded to be 99 5 in this study the radium free brine water was then diluted with radium free deionized water to batch solutions each 25 l with salinity of 5 psu 15 psu 25 psu 35 psu 45 psu 65 psu 85 psu 105 psu 125 psu 145 psu 165 psu 185 psu 205 psu and 233 psu respectively afterwards 10 g sediment was added into the batch solutions and the mixtures are also equivalent to a suspended particulate matter concentration of 0 54 kg m 3 in the river water around the lake the mixtures were stirred for 2 h and precipitated for 1 h statically the supernatant was filtered with a 0 45 μm cartridge and was passed through the mno2 fiber slowly to extract radium the radium activity was measured intermediately by radecc to avoid significant decay loss the measured radium represents the radium derived from suspended particulate matter desorption under different salinity 3 3 chemical analysis 3 3 1 major ion and trace element analysis all the major ions were measured in the analysis department of qinghai institute of salt lakes chinese academy of sciences isl cas with the methods as described in previous studies kong et al 2019 the brine water and hydrothermal groundwater were diluted 100 times before the analysis specifically cl was titrated by agno3 hco3 and co3 2 were titrated by hcl so4 2 was measured by baso4 heterometric titration xiao et al 1992 k and na were analyzed by flame photometer with an error less than 3 5 ca2 and mg2 were measured by edta titration method with an error less than 0 3 the analytical precision for major ions is better than 2 analysis of boron b dissolved silica dsi strontium sr and barium ba were performed in the isl cas using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes with a precision of 10 analysis of lithium content were performed at the clean room class 100 in the state key laboratory of loess and quaternary institute of earth environment chinese academy of sciences using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms with a precision of 5 3 3 2 ra isotopes analyses short lived radium isotopes were measured with a radium delayed coincidence counter radecc moore 2008 moore and arnold 1996 mno2 fibers were washed with deionized water to remove salt residue before the measurement excess moisture of the fiber was removed by compressing air to allow weight ratios of water content to fibers to be 0 5 1 the measurement procedures of short lived radium isotopes 224ra and 223ra can be fully referred to as previous studies kong et al 2019 luo et al 2014 moore 2008 the uncertainties of 223ra and 224ra measurements were calculated to be 3 5 and 8 4 with the equations by garcia solsona et al 2008 after short lived radium isotope measurement long lived 226ra and 228ra in the fiber were measured with gamma spectrometry gmx45p4 ortec as described in previous studies moore 1984 wang et al 2014 the preconditioning and measuring processes of 226ra and 228ra have been fully described in previous studies kong et al 2019 the uncertainties of 226ra and 228ra were 0 1 1 97 and 0 1 5 12 respectively 4 results 4 1 geochemical result the results of major ions salinity and lithium in different water endmembers are shown in table s1 the salinity of the salt lake water of different evaporative stages ranges from 1 9 0 2 to 240 4 0 2 psu spatially the salinity is lower along the shoreline with the lowest at the river plume zones and increases towards the lake center indicating the influence of river water and groundwater input concentrations of major ions and trace elements in different water endmembers of da qaidam lake are shown in table s1 and the relations of major ions versus cl are shown in fig 3 generally concentrations of na k cl so4 2 hco3 li and b3 in lake water are much higher than those in hydrothermal groundwater and river water the concentrations of mg2 ca2 sr and ba2 are highest in lake water followed by shallow groundwater and river water and then by hydrothermal groundwater notably concentrations of si in hydrothermal groundwater are significantly high compared to shallow groundwater and river water and is overall higher than lake water fig 3h the high temperature and pressure in the hydrothermal systems favors the interaction between fluid and rocks as a result silica is prone to be dissolved or weathered from bedrock or aquifer media leading to much high silica concentrations in hydrothermal groundwater chen et al 2020 in the lake water except for sr si ba2 and no3 other major ions and trace elements are all well correlated with cl fig 3g h k c suggesting that lake water geochemistry are mainly influenced by the evaporation process spatially most major ions and trace element show similar distribution to that of cl lower near the shoreline and increasing towards the lake center but ca2 and ba2 show inverse pattern higher near the shoreline and decreasing towards the lake center this phenomenon is mainly ascribed to the precipitation of ca2 and ba2 mineral due to over saturation correlation of major ion versus cl for all the groundwater samples are closely aligned on the lake water evaporation line fig 3a b i j indicating groundwater geochemistry is mainly subject to evaporating process hydro geochemistry characteristics of different water endmembers are shown in the piper diagram fig 4 generally the lake water and hydrothermal groundwater belong to na cl type blue circles in fig 4 some river plume water r6 r7 r8 and r9 are na cl type indicating the influence of brine lake water shallow groundwater and part of inland river water are of mixing type fig 4 4 2 lithium and boron concentration the dissolved li concentrations li and dissolved b3 concentrations b in different water endmembers are listed in table s1 in the groundwater li ranges from 0 003 m moll 1 to 0 5 m moll 1 with an average of 0 2 m moll 1 and b from 0 03 m moll 1 to 3 9 m moll 1 in the groundwater with an average of 1 4 m moll 1 much higher li and b were observed in hydrothermal groundwater compared to shallow groundwater li and b of natural outcrop hydrothermal groundwater are greater than that of deep hydrothermal water which could be ascribed to the dissolution along with the groundwater flow path in the river water li and b have a much low concentration ranges of 0 003 0 1 m mol l 1 and 0 1 0 6 m mol l 1 respectively both constituents exhibit significantly high values compared to most other river worldwide huh et al 1998 li and b in the rainwater snow smelting water is much more depleted about 0 14 1 15 μmol l 1 and 46 25 20 35 μmol l 1 respectively in the lake water li ranges from 0 1 m mol l 1 to 38 0 m mol l 1 with an average of 6 6 m moll 1 and b from 3 7 m mol l 1 to 202 3 m mol l 1 with an average of 31 7 m mol l 1 notably boron exhibits significantly high values compared to most other salt lakes and brines worldwide liu et al 2000 uuml et al 2013 wei et al 2014 li has a positive correlation with b in the brine lake fig 5 suggesting that both constituents were under saturated along with the increase of evaporation stages spatially li and b have a low value at river plume zones and increase from the nearshore to lake center indicating the influence of lgd and river discharge the clay minerals are mainly illite and chlorite with a small portion of montmorillonite in sediment of da qaidam lake li has very high content in the sediment compared to that in the continental crust teng et al 2004 ranging from 0 09 to 0 2 mg g 1 while b has a moderate content in the sediment ranging from 3 8 to 17 2 mg g 1 xiao et al 1994 4 3 results of radium isotopes 4 3 1 dissolved radium isotope activities the activities of ra isotopes in different water endmembers are shown in details in table s1 the spatial distributions of 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra in different water endmembers are presented in fig 6 spatially the 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra activities are much higher in the river plume zones with the highest activity at the station of l1 fig 6e h and linearly decrease toward the lake center indicating the influences of riverine input and lgd input luo et al 2017a 2016 peterson et al 2008a generally 223ra and 224ra activities are mainly controlled by lgd input sediment regeneration and particulate desorption leading to radium excesses at the nearshore shallow zones the possibly much longer water residence time in the lake center will also favor the decay loss additionally lowering the two nuclide activities towards the lake center for long lived 226ra and 228ra their activities are mainly subject to desorption at the nearshore sub saline areas and co precipitation and evaporation enrichment at the lake center areas exhibiting relatively steady state condition spatially breier and edmonds 2007 moore 2003 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra activities in groundwater are in the ranges of 1 8 0 1 to 51 1 3 6 26 1 3 to 1924 96 2 20 5 0 03 to 1190 0 1 and 37 3 0 1 to 2404 3 8 dpm 100 l 1 radium activities of groundwater samples were significantly higher than those of lake water and river water the 223ra 224ra and 228ra activities of deep hydrothermal groundwater hs3 are 3 4 times of that natural outcrop hydrothermal groundwater hs2 however 226ra activity shows inverse condition compared to other three nuclides this phenomenon suggested that short lived 223ra 224ra and 228ra were probably subject to decay loss long lived 226ra were subject to the recoil input or production during the groundwater transport luo and jiao 2019 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra activities in river water are in the ranges of 0 3 0 02 to 12 1 0 8 10 8 0 5 to 218 10 9 4 4 0 04 to 89 6 0 1 and 30 3 0 1 to 218 8 0 7 dpm 100 l 1 223ra and 226ra in river water exhibit narrow activity range compared to that of 224ra and 228ra in river water the 223ra 224ra and 228ra activities overall decrease towards headwater streams fig 6a d 223ra 224ra and 228ra activities in river water were larger than those in lake water but lower than groundwater fig 6a d however 226ra activities in the river water were lower than those in lake water 4 3 2 riverine radium desorption as a result of the long term weathering of rocks ra isotopes in the river water mainly exist in dissolved and particular forms before entering the lake under the fresh water environment ra isotopes have strong affinity to the particular matter after emptying into the lakes radium isotopes are prone to desorb when encountering the saline environment key et al 1985 table 1 shows the experiment result of ra activities derived from suspended particulate under different salinity the loading of 223ra from desorption range from 1 1 0 1 to 16 2 0 7 dpm kg 1 respectively the desorption activities of 224ra range from 11 2 0 3 to 319 8 10 1 dpm kg 1 and have the crest value at the salinity of 24 8 psu 104 1 psu and 165 1 psu the desorption activities of 226ra and 228ra range from 54 4 0 1 to 313 6 0 4 dpm kg 1 and from 235 8 0 5 to 733 4 1 3 dpm kg 1 respectively they have a similar desorption pattern and the crest value both at the salinity of 125 8 psu radium desorption capacity overall increase with salinity before salinity of 50 psu this pattern suggests that radium isotopes will be desorbed effectively at the river plumes zones with salinity threshold of 50 psu fig 7 the mass loadings of 224ra and 228ra desorption are overall 1 2 times of 226ra desorption loadings this is because that 224ra and 228ra belong to the 232th decay chain and has much higher activities in the sorbed pool than that of 226ra 5 discussion 5 1 radium sources for the lake water potential sources of radium to the lake water include river water inputs desorption from riverine sediment lgd loadings and sedimentary diffusion the relations between different radium nuclides in different water end members are presented in fig 8 generally positive linear correlations were observed between lognormal concentrations of different nuclides suggesting radium isotopes are regulated by the same predominant process radium activity ratios ar specifically ar 223ra 226ra ar 224ra 226ra ar 224ra 228ra and ar 228ra 226ra can reflect radium sources in the hydrologic and lithological systems the ars of radium nuclides for different water endmembers are shown in table s1 the ars of 228ra to 226ra for lake water was notably close to that of hydrothermal groundwater hs3 and was significantly different from that of river water and shallow groundwater the ar 228ra 226ra of deep hydrothermal groundwater natural outcrop hydrothermal groundwater shallow groundwater and lake water are 2 7 n 1 0 7 n 2 2 4 n 5 and 2 6 n 33 respectively for the lake water 228ra vs 226ra has good positive linear correlation with a slope of 1 89 r2 0 90 n 33 the hydrothermal groundwater and shallow groundwater samples have a very similar ars 228ra 226ra indicating a rather similar diagenesis processes the natural outcrops hydrothermal groundwater hs2 had a significantly lower ar 228ra 226ra compared to that lake water suggesting that natural outcrops hydrothermal groundwater cannot explain the ar 228ra 226ra of lake water deep hydrothermal groundwater and shallow groundwater have approximate ar 228ra 226ra to the lake water indicating these water endmembers are primary lake water radium sources riverine radium loading can be derived from dissolved radium and its desorption portion from particulars when encountering saline environments the major rivers around the lake are the datoyanggou river and baligou river the averaged dissolved 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra activities were 7 8 0 3 180 4 5 9 116 5 0 2 and 353 6 0 6 dpm kg 1 respectively based on the desorption experiment results kong et al 2021 the desorption radium activity can be calculated according to the following equation 1 r a d r a susd c where rasusd dpm kg 1 and c kg m 3 are normalized radium desorption loading from suspended particles and content of suspended particles of river water which is setting to be 0 54 kg m 3 for datoyanggou river and baligou river xue 2001 the desorption radium loadings for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra were estimated to be 0 4 0 1 9 7 0 3 6 3 0 1 and 19 1 0 1 dpm 100l 1 respectively table 1 almost one order of magnitude lower compared to the dissolved riverine radium loadings 223ra 2 1 109 dpm y 1 224ra 3 1 1010 dpm y 1 226ra 7 6 109 dpm y 1 and 228ra 3 9 1010 dpm y 1 sedimentary diffusion rates for radium isotopes were estimated based on sediment tank incubation experiments with a diffusion flux rates jdiff dpm m2 h 1 0 1 4 7 0 1 and 0 3 for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra respectively kong et al 2021 based on the obtained diffusion flux rates radium loadings from sediment diffusion can be calculated as 2 i diff j diff a sed where jdiff is the diffusion flux of radium as aforementioned dpm m 2 h 1 ased is lakebed area m2 the lake area of da qaidam lake sediment is about 35 45 km2 with the parameters the sediment diffusion loadings of 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra are estimated to be 4 0 1010 1 5 1012 3 1 1010 and 9 8 1010 dpm y 1 respectively the sediment diffusion loading is as much as more than 2 times of riverine radium loading since the 226ra and 228ra activities of rainwater is low to 12 7 0 3 and 0 8 0 1 dpm 100l 1 and the annual precipitation of only 90 mm in da qaidam lake region the 226ra and 228ra input from rainwater is estimated to be 5 2 108 dpm y 1 and 3 3 107 dpm y 1 in general radium isotopes of the lake water are mainly sourced from riverine loadings deep hydrothermal groundwater shallow groundwater and sedimentary diffusion with minor to negligible contributions from rainfall 5 2 radium co precipitation in the lake water and saturation index of electrolyte the correlations of radium isotopes versus salinity are shown in details in fig 9 for salinity less than 50 psu radium isotopes increase with salinity and after salinity is large than 170 psu the radium isotopes decrease with salinity in lake water this phenomenon is induced by co precipitation along with the increase of salinity and intensity of evaporation stages to figure out the salinity minimum threshold for the triggering of co precipitation the fitting curves of radium versus salinity for two salinity intervals were obtained and the intersection of the two fitting curves were regarded as the threshold salinity to trigger the co precipitation the results show that the threshold salinity for co precipitation for 223ra 224ra 226ra and 228ra are 58 8 psu 139 2 psu 76 9 psu and 85 2 psu respectively it reveals that different radium isotopes have different threshold values to trigger the co precipitations after the triggering of co precipitation 223ra has very weak correlation r2 0 21 fig 9e with salinity suggesting the negligible co precipitation effect as 223ra has extremely low activities and mass concentration 224ra has moderate positive linear correlation r2 0 48 fig 9f and 226ra and 228ra have significant positive linear correlations r2 0 83 and 0 81 with salinity suggesting the three nuclides are highly influenced by co precipitation as the mass concentrations of 226ra and 228ra are much highly compared to 224ra therefore the triggering thresholds of the long lived radium isotopes are much small compared to that of 224ra fig 9g h electrolyte of the lake water will experience over saturation along with the intensity of evaporative stages mercedes martín et al 2019 in the brine water radium isotopes are prone to co precipitate along with ca ba sr precipitates kiro et al 2013 the saturation index si characterizing whether electrolyte solution is saturated undersatured or supersaturated with respect to the given minerals si can be calculated with the si log10 iap ksp where iap and ksp are ion activation products and the chemical equilibrium constant for the mineral of interests the iap ksp and si of ca ba sr compounds in the lake water is calculated with phreeqc v3 4 barite baso4 si was calculated to be from 0 3 to 2 1 table 2 at different evaporating stages indicating lake water of all evaporative stages are oversaturated with respective to baso4 si of calcite caco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 were calculated to be from 0 55 to 0 9 and from 1 7 to 2 7 in the lake water both under oversaturated condition under all the evaporative stages also saturation indexes of calcite and dolomite are not applicable for samples with salinity large than 170 psu ascribed to the over depletion of co3 2 in the later evaporative stage waters si of celestite of the majority of the lake water samples were native indicating celestite under saturation conditions however two samples l30 and l32 exhibit slight over saturation with si of 0 1 and 0 2 respectively because the two stations located at the south of the lake are under the latest evaporative stages fig 6a d the saturation degree of halite nacl were calculated to be from 0 01 to 5 0 and all under saturated previous studies have demonstrated radium has a high co precipitation capacity with baso4 srso4 caso4 and caso4 2h2o with the co precipitation coefficients of 1 2 rosenberg et al 2011a 296 zhu 2004 800 langmuir and riese 1985 and 0 1 gnanapragasam and lewis 1995 respectively in this study only the saturation of baso4 is observed and is considered to be the dominant mechanism to remove radium isotopes by co precipitation as indicated in fig 9e g radium isotopes increase with salinity when it below the co precipitation threshold salinity and turn to decrease with salinity when it exceeds the threshold salinity however radium isotopes have a positive correlation with ba for lake water in all the evaporative stage further stress that radium is co precipitated with baso4 fig 9d radium co precipitation with baso4 precipitates are also observed in other brine waters and intensively evaporative ponds rosenberg et al 2013 2018 the radium co precipitation with baso4 in the form of ra ba so4 precipitates is an important process to constrain the brine lake hydro geochemical evolution kiro et al 2012 luo et al 2017a 5 3 multi tracer models coupled radium mass balance water budget and tracer buildup multi tracer models consist of mass balance of 226ra buildup model of conservative tracers of li cl and sr and water budget the regional water budget can be written as 3 lg d d l g d s f r p e 0 where lgdd and lgds are the groundwater discharge of deep hydrothermal groundwater d and shallow groundwater s fr is river discharge p is precipitation and e is the evaporation the radium isotopes especially for long lived 226ra and 228ra are highly influenced by the co precipitation the lake stages with salinity greater than 80 psu as aforementioned at the early evaporative stages salinity 80 psu radium isotopes in the lake water increases with salinity indicating negligible co precipitation removals and relatively non steady state at the late evaporative stage co precipitation will be triggered after salinity 80 psu fig 9g h under this occasion the removal of radium isotopes by co precipitation is considered to be balanced by the sources from riverine and lgd loadings thus after the triggering of co precipitation the mass balance equation for the 226ra which is the highest in mass concentration among the four nuclides can be written as 4 lg d d 226 r a d l g d s 226 r a s f r 226 r a r f di f cp 0 where 226radg and 226rag and 226rar are the 226ra activities of deep hydrothermal groundwater d and shallow groundwater s and river water respectively fdi is radium loading from sedimentary diffusion f cp is removal rates of radium by co precipitation differed from radium isotopes whose sources are balanced by the sinks of co precipitation these tracers cl li and sr are subject to build up along with evaporative stages the build up theories of these tracers can be verified by the linear increasing of their concentrations with salinity in all the lake water evaporative fig 3d g the existence of this build up condition is also evidenced by the under saturation of nacl in all lake water evaporative stages the build up model of these tracers can be written as 5 l g d d l i d l g d s l i s f r l i r v δ l i l 6 l g d d c l d l g d s c l s f r c l r v δ c l l 7 l g d d s r d l g d s s r s f r s r r v δ s r l where the subscripts of d s and r denotes the concentrations lithium chloride and strontium of deep hydrothermal groundwater shallow groundwater and river water respectively δlil δcll and δsrl are the buildup concentrations of li cl and sr in the lake water due to increase of evaporative stages and v is volume of lake water to bridge the radium mass balance model and the conservative tracer buildup models the relations of radium versus these build up tracers after the co precipitation threshold salinity are explored and shown in fig 10 a c good negative linear correlations are found between 226ra vs cl r2 0 78 226ra vs li r2 0 41 and 226ra vs sr r2 0 30 with a slope of 79033 42 8 and 15 2 respectively it indicates that removal rates of radium isotopes by co precipitation can be manifested by these tracers build up rates using obtained correlation equations in fig 9a c therefore the build up equations can be rewritten in the forms of radium co precipitations rates 8 l g d d l i d l g d s l i s f r l i r v k ra l i f cp v c ra l i 9 l g d d c l d l g d s c l s f r c l r v k ra c l f cp v c ra c l 10 l g d d s r d l g d s s r s f r s r r v k ra s r f cp v c ra s r where kra cl kra li and kra sr equals 79033 42 8 and 15 2 and cra cl cra li and cra sr equals 201525 83 7 and 18 5 respectively this approach can be effectively used to decipher the co precipitation rates of the brine lake water which is difficult to estimate based on traditional approaches 5 4 lgd and the derived lithium and boron loadings 5 4 1 lgd and radium co precipitation rate estimates the ternary linear equations of 3 4 8 3 4 9 and 3 4 10 are employed to solve the three unknowns lgdd lgds and fcp substituting all given and estimated parameters table 3 into these ternary linear equations lgdd and lgds are estimated to be in the range of 7 5 106 m3 y 1 9 9 106 m3 y 1 and 2 3 107 m3 y 1 2 6 107 m3 y 1 respectively the average of lgdd and lgds are obtained to be 8 8 106 m3 y 1 and 2 4 107 m3 y 1 the lgds is about one order of magnitude larger than that of lgdd indicating that lake water are primary sourced from shallow groundwater rather than deep groundwater the groundwater discharge rates of wenquangou hydrothermal springs entering da qaidam lake are estimated to be 10 0 25 1 l s 1 3 2 7 9 105 m3 y 1 based on continuous observation zhang 1987 and this range is about one magnitude lower than the lgdd in this study this is reasonable as the lake might be recharged by hydrothermal springs at lakebed or from other places previous studies on the groundwater discharge rates at alluvial fan section of baligou a sub catchment with an area about 1 3 of the lake basin is estimated to be 1 9 107 m3 y 1 based on darcy s law wang et al 2016 which is also about 1 3 of the lgds in this study this further stresses the tenability of lgds estimate in this study in the study area the total runoff and precipitation into the lake are 3 7 107 m3 y 1 and 4 1 106 m3 y 1 respectively lgdd and total lgd are about 24 1 20 5 to 27 2 and 91 0 of the river discharge or 11 9 10 1 to 13 5 and 45 0 of the total water input to the lake lgdd is as small as precipitation it is concluded that lgd is dominant component of water input at the da qaidam lake normally lgd plays an important role in delivering constituent to the lake water bodies as groundwater is highly enriched in resource trace elements in the groundwater especially for deep hydrothermal groundwater 226ra removal rate by co precipitation is estimated to be to 6 4 1010 dpm y 1 based on which co precipitation coefficient of the lake is estimated to be 4 7 6 1 y 1 these values are comparable to those of the brine lakes in the desert environments luo et al 2017b intensive evaporation of the brine lakes in the arid environments will highly contribute to the co precipitation processes of radium therefore as a key process for radium behaviors in the brine lakes co precipitation should be taken into account in other similar studies to assess the magnitude of uncertainty of the multi tracer models the sensitivity of estimated lgd to changes in other variables is examined a sensitivity coefficient f is proposed to evaluate this uncertainty according to previous studies langston et al 2013 luo et al 2018b higher f indicates a large uncertainty of the final lgd estimate in this study the uncertainty mainly stems from 226ra li cl and sr measurements in different water endmembers the uncertainty of lgd estimate is mainly derived from uncertainty of 226ra with an uncertainty of 0 1 2 0 li with an uncertainty of about 5 cl with an uncertainty of about 2 and sr with an uncertainty of about 10 in different water endmembers thus the integrated uncertainty of lgd is estimated to be 17 1 19 the lgd of this study is compared to previous studies elsewhere table 4 generally our lgd estimate is significantly lower compared to lgd in other regions the much low estimates could be ascribed to the climate and topographic difference the da qaidam lake is located at the very arid environment in qaidam basin and has a low relief topographic setting around the lakeshore therefore the lgd in this study is much lower than those salt lakes in similar climate of badain jaran desert luo xx as the latter lakes have significant high relief settings and therefore much high lgd 5 4 2 lgd derived li and b loadings with the obtained lgdd and lgds and the lithium and boron concentrations in the shallow and deep hydrothermal groundwater table 3 and fig 11 the lgdd derived and lgds derived lithium loads were estimated to be from 19 4 to 25 8 t y 1 and from 2 7 to 3 0 t y 1 with an average of 22 9 t y 1 and 2 8 t y 1 respectively total lgd derived lithium loading accounts for 79 0 76 8 to 80 8 of total water borne lithium to the lake the lgdd derived lithium load accounts for 88 8 86 6 to 90 5 of total lgd derived lithium load and for 70 2 66 5 to 73 1 of total water borne lithium the lgdd derived and lgds derived boron loads were estimated to be from 315 5 to 419 0 t y 1 and from 102 7 to 113 6 t y 1 with an average of 371 4 t y 1 and 107 7 t y 1 respectively total lgd derived boron load accounts for 77 7 75 8 to 79 2 of total water borne boron lgdd derived boron load accounts for 77 3 73 5 to 80 3 of total lgd derived lithium loads and 60 1 55 8 to 63 6 of total water borne boron although lgdd only accounts very small portion of the total lgd it will deliver disproportionate resource element loadings to the lake water compared to shallow groundwater discharge and riverine loadings this is because the shallow groundwater and river water has much depleted resource element as they are mainly supplied by snow ice melting water and minorly influenced by weathering processes while deep groundwater is subject to intensive rock fluid interactions and therefore significantly enriched in these resource elements nordstrom et al 1989 thus lgd is an important conveyor of deep resource elements to the surface water systems and are vital to for the sustainably exploitation of the resources elements in mega brine lakes it is also suggested that groundwater borne li and b will to some degree ease the intensive exploitation 6 conclusion radium isotopes are systemically investigated in different water endmembers in a mega brine lake da qaidam lake in the qtp multi trace models of radium mass balance water budget and conservative trace buildup models were employed to estimate lgdd and lgds of the da qaidam lake leading to an estimate of 7 5 106 m3 y 1 to 9 9 106 m3 y 1 and 2 3 107 m3 y 1 to 2 6 107 m3 y 1 respectively and the average of lgdd and lgds are 8 8 106 m3 y 1 and 2 4 107 m3 y 1 the radium in the lakes is predominantly controlled by co precipitation with a co precipitation rates of from 4 7 to 6 1 y 1 the lgdd and lgds derived lithium loads were estimated from 19 4 to 25 8 t y 1 and from 2 7 to 3 0 t y 1 respectively and boron loads from 315 5 to 419 0 t y 1 and from 102 7 to 113 6 t y 1 respectively this study implies that although lgdd constitutes a relatively small portion of the brine hydrologic partitioning it predominates the lithium and boron loadings to the salt lake this study presents the first attempt to estimate the lgd and the associated lithium and boron loadings to a large qtp brine lake in china and would be constructive to similar studies in saline lakes in qtp and elsewhere in the world the results of this study are of significance for the conservation of water and reasonably exploitation and utilization of lithium and boron this study demonstrates that

4563,a general semi analytical model for transient flow in a three layered aquifer system with a partial penetration well having a variable discharge of pumping is developed with the consideration of the interface flow on the adjacent layers this general three layer system includes the conventional aquitard aquifer aquitard system as a subset and does not require that the permeability contrasts of different layers must be greater than a few orders of magnitude and does not ignore any flow components either vertical or horizontal in any layer the pumping well of infinitesimal radius is screened at any portion of the middle layer three widely used types of top and bottom boundary conditions are assigned prescribed head case 1 zero flux case 2 or prescribed head at top and zero flux at bottom case 3 laplace domain solutions for dimensionless drawdown are obtained using hankel transformation and associated time domain solutions are evaluated numerically the newly obtained solutions include some available solutions for two or single layer aquifer systems as subsets the drawdowns for individual layers caused by a well with an exponentially decreased discharge are explored as an example of illustration the results indicate that the pumped layer drawdown close to the partially penetrated well is mainly influenced by the variable pumping rate the late time drawdown for all layers is remarkably affected by the chosen types of top and bottom boundary conditions and the drawdown for case 3 is greater than that for case 1 and smaller than that for case 2 additionally the effect of the pumped layer anisotropy on drawdowns in the three layer system is significant and the anisotropy of the unpumped layers significantly affects the drawdown in the whole aquifer system without large contrast of hydraulic conductivity between the unpumped layers and the pumped layer the drawdowns in all three layers are greatly affected by the location and length of well screen and a larger drawdown can be seen at the position that is closer to the middle point of the screen of the partially penetrating pumping well keywords three layer system well partial penetration variable discharge top and bottom boundary semi analytical solution 1 introduction most groundwater flow model concerning a pumping and or injection well will have the pumping and observation wells in the same aquifer yeh and chang 2013 houben 2015 for a multi aquifer system the pumping and observation wells may be in the same aquifer or in different aquifers as different aquifers in a multi aquifer system are hydraulically connected pumping in a specific aquifer will inevitably induce hydraulic responses over the entire multi aquifer system and the observation well in an unpumped aquifer will also record the drawdown information associated with pumping in the pumped aquifer therefore the questions we need to answer are how to interpret the drawdown information collected at an unpumped aquifer from the pumped aquifer and furthermore is that feasible to conduct aquifer characterization and to obtain the aquifer hydraulic parameters when the drawdown information is collected at an unpumped aquifer from the pumped aquifer to answer these questions one must first develop a robust groundwater flow model in a fully coupled multi aquifer system unfortunately the present models on this subject are severely limited to some demanding and often time unrealistic restrictions the present groundwater flow models related to multi layer aquifer systems are usually established by solving the coupled partial differential equation group of groundwater flow explicitly or with a matrix solver bakker 2013 cihan et al 2011 hantush 1967 hunt 2005 moench 1985 neuman and witherspoon 1969 veling and mass 2009 in those models some strong assumptions are often invoked to simplify the system for instance it is commonly assumed that the permeability contrasts among two adjacent aquifers are more than a few orders of magnitude thus flow in the much less permeable layer is assumed to be perpendicular to the layering while the flow in the much greater permeability layer is assumed to be parallel to the layering hantush 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 such a simplification may be acceptable for investigating an aquifer aquitard system as the aquitard aquifer permeability contrasts can be indeed as large as a few orders of magnitude hantush 1964a lin et al 2019 neuman 1968 yeh and chang 2013 but this assumption is baseless for a general multi aquifer system in which the permeability contrasts among different layers are much modest another commonly used assumption in present models is that mass exchange between two adjacent aquifers can be treated as a volumetric sink source incorporated into the governing equations of flow in each individual layer the so called hantush jacob assumption hantush and jacob 1955 this assumption is also problematic in the sense that it does not honor the fact that mass exchange between two adjacent layers always occurs at the interfaces of those adjacent layers rather than as a volumetric sink source inside those layers a treatment that can generate considerable errors as documented in numerous investigations e g hantush 1967 feng and zhan 2015 feng et al 2019 2020 zhan and bian 2006 zhu and wen 2020 a third simplification in present models is to assume a constant pumping rate hantush 1964a yeh and chang 2013 the constant pumping rate is desirable but is quite difficult to maintain in actual pumping scenarios which almost always involve variable pumping rates because of many reasons such as the temporary loss of power increased drawdown in the pumping well with time which makes it more difficult to lift water from the pumping well and other constrains in conducting pumping tests in the field chen et al 2020 hantush 1964a mishra et al 2013 sen and altunkaynak 2004 singh 2009 wen et al 2017 in theory numerical modeling can avoid many restrictions mentioned above to investigate a multi aquifer system but it has some issues that are sometimes not easy to resolve for instance it is not straightforward to use a numerical model for aquifer characterization to obtain the aquifer parameters particularly when dealing with a multi aquifer system involving many hydraulic parameters for multiple aquifers when the numerical model has to be used for such a purpose it often involves either trial and error or automatic optimization procedures to minimize the model generated drawdown with the observed drawdown mohanty et al 2013 2019 this process can sometimes lead to non uniqueness of inverted aquifer parameters rahman et al 2020 another issue associated with numerical model is that without a benchmark analytical solution it is unknown how much numerical errors have been involved in the numerical model for a multi aquifer system the numerical errors can be considerable near the interfaces of different aquifers where the aquifer parameters change suddenly neuman 1968 louwyck et al 2012 if one recalls that any numerical approaches no matter they are finite difference finite element boundary element or others essentially involve some sorts of smoothing or average schemes to approximate the mass conservation law in a discrete sense then it is not surprise to know that numerical errors are prone to be large near sharp interfaces cihan et al 2011 neuman 1968 loudyi et al 2007 of course one can use gradually finer meshes when approaching the interfaces of different aquifers to minimize the numerical errors but such a procedure can sometimes increase the computational cost rapidly particularly when dealing with three dimensional 3d flow in a multi aquifer system feng et al 2020 rahman et al 2020 rühaak et al 2008 overall establishing a sufficiently accurate numerical model for groundwater flow in a multi aquifer system is feasible but often time requires considerable preparations and computational cost based on above considerations we are going to establish a robust and generic 3d groundwater flow in a three aquifer system in this investigation the generality of this work is reflected on the following aspects firstly it does not put any constrains on the permeability contrasts among different aquifers involved such a generality will make this work much more appealing to deal with a vast number of cases in actual aquifer setting it also encompasses previous aquifer aquitard two layer system and aquitard aquifer aquitard three layer systems as subsets it can even be applied for an extreme two layer or three layer system such as a fracture rock two layer system or a rock fracture rock three layer system when flow can occur in both fractures and rock matrix furthermore for the rock fracture rock three layer system the rocks adjacent to the fracture can be either identical with the same hydraulic properties or have different lithology and hydraulic properties the two aquifer system investigated by feng et al 2019 is also a subset of this study secondly this study honors the mass exchange among different aquifers as an interface flow phenomenon not as a volumetric sink source term as in the hantush jacob assumption thirdly the pumping rate can be any given function of time instead of being a constant this is a distinctive difference from the three aquifer study of feng et al 2020 involving constant pumping rate fourthly three widely used top and bottom boundary conditions are considered that can be specified as a constant head boundary case1 or a no flux boundary case 2 and a constant head boundary at the top in combination with a no flux boundary at the bottom case 3 this is also in contrast with feng et al 2019 feng et al 2020 which cannot investigate the combined effects of the top and bottom boundaries simultaneously in the following sections semi analytical drawdown solutions in nondimensional forms in a genetic three layer system are obtained by performing laplace hankel transform and eventually the real time solutions are calculated by the method of numerical inversion finally as an example of illustration the characteristics of drawdown are thoroughly investigated due to a partially penetrated well pumped at an exponentially decreased discharge function the results are discussed extensively and their applications are elaborated as well 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical model fig 1 displays an infinitesimal radius well with a variable discharge q t in a general three layer aquifer system of unbound lateral extension the pumping well is partially penetrated in the middle layer of the system with a screen length from d to l shown in this figure each layer of constant thickness is homogeneous and anisotropic three dimensional flow is included in all layers the interface flow at the two neighboring layers is linked with head and flux continuity conditions it is noted that three different cases presented by hantush 1960 are concluded specifically the boundaries at the top and bottom are simultaneously constant head boundaries case 1 no flux boundaries case 2 or a combination of a constant head top boundary and no flux bottom boundary case 3 the cylindrical coordinate origin is at the intersection of the well axis and the bottom of the middle pumped layer according to the conceptual model above the equations that govern the transient drawdown distribution for flow to a pumping well can be given by 1 k ri r r r s i r z t r k zi 2 s i r z t z 2 s si s i r z t t where s r z t denotes drawdown at space coordinate radial distance r l vertical distance z l and time coordinate pumping time t l kr and kz indicate respectively the hydraulic conductivities in the radial and vertical direction l t ss refers to specific storage 1 l and i 1 2 3 designate respectively the middle pumped layer upper layer and lower layer the initial conditions of the aquifer system can be written as 2 s i r z 0 0 the boundary of the aquifer system at infinity yields 3 s i z t 0 the pumping well of infinitesimal diameter is partially penetrated in the middle layer the wellbore boundary condition is subject to hantush 1964a liang et al 2018 4 lim r 0 r s 1 r 0 l z b 1 q t 2 π k r 1 l d d z l 0 0 z d in which q t represents the well discharge of pumping l3t 1 b 1 refers to the thickness of the middle pumped aquifer l it is notable that an assumption of the well discharge uniformly distributed along the screened section of the partially penetrating well is used herein this of course is a simplification for the sake of mathematical modeling fortunately this simplification is proven to be sufficiently accurate for regions that are not extremely close to the pumping well within a few well radii yeh and chang 2013 as an example of illustration the pumping rate used in this study varies exponentially with the pumping time in the form hantush 1964b 1966 wen et al 2017 5 q t q q 1 q e α t which is based on lots of field data and available works chen et al 2020 feng et al 2019 sen and altunkaynak 2004 the symbol q and q 1 represent the final constant and initial well discharge respectively l3t 1 and α designates decay constant obtained from the measured data of pumping t 1 note that one can obtain the analytical solution of variable pumping rate case by using the principle of superposition based on the solution of constant pumping rate case but it is much needed to provide a simple and more direct semi analytical solution if possible with variable discharge as this is commonly encountered in real world pumping tests according to field experiences hantush 1964b 1966 sen and altunkaynak 2004 wen et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the inner well face boundary conditions at the upper and lower unpumped layers yield 6 lim r 0 r s 2 r lim r 0 r s 3 r 0 and the boundary condition at the interface between the middle pumped aquifer and the adjacent upper layer z b 1 requires that 7 s 1 r z t s 2 r z t z b 1 and 8 k z 1 s 1 r z t z k z 2 s 2 r z t z z b 1 the continuity of hydraulic connection between the middle pumped layer and the lower unpumped layer z 0 can be written as 9 s 1 r z t s 3 r z t z 0 and 10 k z 1 s 1 r z t z k z 3 s 3 r z t z z 0 the top boundary condition at the upper unpumped layer z b 2 and the bottom boundary condition at the lower unpumped layer z b 3 of the aquifer system can be in the manner of hantush 1960 and moench 1985 expressed in three ways for case 1 the constant head boundaries at both top and bottom boundaries can be respectively written as 11 s 2 r z

the top and the no flux boundary at the bottom are respectively 15 s 2 r z t 0 z b 2 and 16 s 3 r z t z 0 z b 3 it should be remarked that the adopted three different types of top and bottom boundaries expressed in eqs 11 16 are commonly encountered in practice in some cases the upper layer is covered with ponded water the upper and lower layers are respectively overlain and underlain a layer of a highly transmissivity or the induced drawdown at the top bottom boundary is not affected by pumping under such conditions the constant head condition can be imposed at the boundary on the other hand if there is an impermeable layer below the lower layer or above the upper layer the no flux boundary can be adopted correspondingly as for the relevant literature one may consult baker 2006

in the unpumped layers as in previous works of hantush 1960 moench 1985 and chen et al 2020 the condition for this assumption is that the permeability of the middle pumped aquifer is usually larger at least two orders of magnitude than that of the upper and lower aquitards additionally the transient dimensionless solutions in the three layer aquifer system caused by a partially penetrating constant

of drawdown agree with the solutions of feng et al 2019 describing flow in a two layer aquifer system pumped by a partial penetration well of a variable constant discharge subject to a zero drawdown

by feng and zhan 2015 that can be applied to investigate the drawdown caused by a pumping well of partial penetration in an aquitard aquifer system where the horizontal flow in the upper layer is neglected and a zero drawdown condition can be imposed at the top boundary 2 3 3 special cases in a single layer aquifer if ignoring the leakage effect between two adjacent layers the present pumped layer drawdown solutions can reduce to the solution of hantush 1964a for flow in a confined aquifer due to a partially penetrated well with constant pumping rate q 1 d 1 when the pumped layer is fully penetrated by a well with an exponentially decreasing discharge and leakage is not considered eqs 34b 34d collapse to the drawdown solution of wen et al 2017 additionally the classical solution of theis is also included in the new obtained solution when q 1 d 1 2 4 numerical inversion of the solutions so far the laplace domain solutions of nondimensional drawdown for diverse cases are developed in this study a numerical integration algorithm ogata 2005 with the method using the zeros of the bessel functions as nodes can be performed to calculate the infinite integral associated with the transformation of hankel and the method of de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 is able to be applied to solve the transformation of laplace finally one can apply the inversion of hankel transformation to obtain the semi analytical solution in laplace domain and apply the inversion of laplace transformation to obtain the final time domain solution for the inversion of hankel transformation the ogata 2005 method has two free parameters h the step size and n the number of steps performed which respectively determine the resolution and upper limit of the integration grid these can be modified to accurately transform any function that theoretically converges and we found that h 0 00001 and n 170 are enough for the inverse hankel transformation and 40 terms of the series used in de hoog algorithm has sufficient accuracy for the inverse solutions in this study the other more details for verification and validation of the method have been proven and can be found in the study of de hoog et al 1982 ogata 2005 feng et al 2020 and liang et al 2018 which is not discussed herein 3 results the dimensionless drawdown response due to a partial penetration well pumped at an exponentially decreasing discharge is explored in the following from several perspectives default values for realistic aquifers are used in the following analysis b 1 20 m b 2 30 m b 3 10 m kr 1 kz 1 10 4 ms 1 kr 2 kz 2 10 6 ms 1 kr 3 kz 3 10 6 ms 1 ss 1 2 10 5 m 1 ss 2 10 3 m 1 ss 3 10 6 m 1 q 1 0 005 m3s 1 q 0 002 m3s 1 one can see that the upper and lower unpumped layers have the same hydraulic properties of aquitard composed of clay soil for simplicity and middle pumped layer may be composed of sand soils in reality under this circumstance the three layer system becomes a commonly investigated three layer aquitard aquifer aquitard system hantush 1960 moench 1985 wen et al 2011 chen et al 2020 which will be analyzed for comparison with existing works though the presented solution applies to a general three layer aquifer systems with no restrictions on the hydraulic parameter e g permeability specific storage and the thickness of each layer aquifer anisotropy and different permeability contrasts among individual layers will also be explored to show the importance of considering both vertical and horizontal flows for each of the three layers no matter the layer is pumped or unpumped 3 1 comparison with available solutions fig 2 a illustrates the drawdown responses of the pumped layer at rd 0 1 and zd 0 5 caused by a full penetration pumping well ld 1 dd 0 in an aquitard aquifer aquitard system case 3 in this study hantush 1960 an aquitard aquifer system feng and zhan 2015 feng et al 2019 and a confined aquifer system theis 1935 wen et al 2017 fig 2 b shows the pumped aquifer drawdown at the same location as fig 2 a due to a partial penetration pumping well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 in present solution for case 3 solutions of feng and zhan 2015 and feng et al 2019 for a leaky confined aquifer system and hantush 1964a for a nonleaky confined aquifer system both the cases of constant q 1 d 1 and variable discharge q 1 d 2 5 αd 0 8 are considered in this figure no matter what the well discharge is under the circumstance of a full penetration well the early time drawdown for almost all study agrees with one another except for the modified hantush 1960 solution the results are slightly larger than that of modified hantush 1960 for an aquitard aquifer aquitard system if using the hantush jacob approximation and the assumption of only considering the radial flow in the pumped layer and vertical flow in the unpumped aquitard because the leakage effect is regarded as a sink source term introduced in the pumped aquifer governing equation in hantush 1960 it is no strange to see a smaller drawdown in early time as demonstrated in fig 2 the drawdown of theis 1935 and wen et al 2017 with a full penetration well in fig 2 a or hantush 1964a with a partial penetration well in fig 2 b is always larger than the others with the increasing of pumping time due to no leakage from adjacent layers the intermediate time drawdown in a leaky confined aquifer is greater than that in an aquitard aquifer aquitard system which may be caused by less leakage into the pumped aquifer derived entirely from the upper aquitard storage the late time steady state drawdowns can be found in two layer and three layer aquifer system and their values are almost the same as each other moreover the time to approach the steady state for two layer aquifer system feng and zhan 2015 feng et al 2019 is much earlier than that for three layer aquifer system hantush 1960 present study for case 3 this is to be understood that the water from top boundary of the aquifer system of two layer is also much quicker to supply the pumped aquifer because the pumped aquifer drawdown is not influenced by the storage of the lower layer in the aquifer system of three layer comparison of the dimensionless drawdown solution induced by a full penetration pumping well obtained by this study for case 3 and modified hantush 1960 one can only see the difference at early and intermediate times when td is smaller than about 102 as demonstrated in fig 2 a this can be attributed to the following aspects firstly the hantush jacob approximation is used in modified hantush 1960 secondly the flow in the radial direction of aquitard and flow in the vertical direction of the pumped aquifer are not taken into consideration in modified hantush 1960 however the present study takes account of the horizontal and vertical flows in each layer as we as treat the leakage across the two adjacent layers as continuity boundary conditions rather than a simplified volumetric sink source term accordingly our general analytical model can reflect the actual leakage process therefore one can conclude that the use of the hantush jacob approximation should be deliberated especially at the early pumping time for a fully penetrating well one can see from fig 2 b that the storage of lower unpumped aquitard primarily affects the drawdown distribution for the three layer aquifer system of case 3 at the intermediate pumping time signifying that the hydraulic parameters of lower aquitard can be estimated by using the observed data at this stage in additional more comparative analysis for the pumped aquifer drawdown in a confined aquifer with a pumping well of full penetration theis 1935 wen et al 2017 or of partial penetration hautush 1964 and in a two layer aquifer with a full partial penetration well feng and zhan 2015 feng et al 2019 can be found in the work of feng et al 2019 which is not repeated herein it should be remarked that the typical curves of drawdown versus pumping time have two inflection points during the decaying period of pumping rate and more discussion and explanation for this feature can be found in wen et al 2017 at last one can see from fig 2 a in comparison with fig 2 b that the pumped layer drawdown due to a partial penetration pumping well is greater than that a full penetration pumping well at the same value of pumping time indicating that the effect of well partial penetration needs to be considered 3 2 effect of various top and bottom boundaries fig 3 shows the changes of drawdown at rd 0 1 in the middle pumped layer zd 0 5 in the upper layer zd 1 2 and in the lower unpumped layer zd 0 4 for case 1 a case 2 b and case 3 c under the condition of a well of full penetration ld 1 dd 0 the solution of hantush 1960 is included in this figure for comparison purposes and the case of no leakage wen et al 2017 is also considered as a reference the curves of drawdown versus time for the pumped layer obtained by this study and hantush 1960 have almost the same feature during the entire pumping stage and their deviations are mainly occurred at the stage of 10 2 td 101 as illustrated in the subgraphs of fig 3 with three different cases the deviations are caused by using the hantush jacob assumption for the solution of hantush 1960 additionally as for the drawdown response in the two unpumped layers one can find from fig 3 that the drawdown developed by this study is always larger than that of hantush 1960 as the pumping time goes by and a relatively stable error between them can be found at late time this is due to fact that the influence of radial flow in the unpumped layer is ignored by hantush 1960 what is more fig 3 b and fig 3 c demonstrate that the drawdown for the lower unpumped layer is nearly identical to that for the pumped layer if only taking account of the vertical flow in the unpumped layer in other words whether the radial flow in the unpumped layer is overlooked or not one can see that from the comparison of drawdowns in the pumped layer with that in the unpumped layer for case 2 and case 3 to compare the drawdowns under different boundaries at the top and bottom of the aquifer system fig 4 displays the drawdown changes at rd 0 1 in the pumped layer zd 0 5 and in the unpumped layers zd 1 2 and zd 0 4 for all three cases with a partial penetration pumping well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 notably the no leaky case modified hantush 1964a is plotted as a reference in this figure fig 4 shows that the influence of the type of top and boundary can be ignored in exploring drawdown at the early and intermediate pumping time however its influence on the late time drawdown behavior is obvious and one can find that the drawdowns for cases 1 and 3 reach steady state at late pumping stage because of the unlimited water supply stemmed from the top zero drawdown boundary in addition the late time drawdown for case 3 is greater than that for case 1 and smaller than that for case 2 this is because the constant head boundary at the top and bottom in case 1 can give steady and unlimited supply of water thus leading to the smallest drawdown among three cases in another aspect the no flux top and bottom boundaries in case 2 cannot furnish any supply of water thus the largest drawdown can be seen among three cases in this figure fig 4 also illustrates that the drawdown for case 2 increases indefinitely with pumping time and finally parallels with that of the no leakage case this is caused by the no flow boundary at the top and bottom furthermore one cannot see the inflection point of the type curves for the unpumped layer indicating that the influence of variable discharge mainly affects the pumped layer drawdown this is because the drawdown response for the unpumped layer appears nearly at the end of the intermediate time and the influence of variable discharge is very small and can be neglected at this stage thus the inflection point cannot be found to further investigate the influence of various top and bottom boundaries on drawdown fig 5 is plotted to demonstrate the drawdown responses in all layers using typical curves of a sd versus r d zd 0 5 1 2 and 0 4 at td 104 b sd versus z d at rd 0 1 with a partial penetration pumping well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 fig 5 a shows that the late time drawdown at any radial distance rd for case 3 is greater than that for case 1 and smaller than that for case 2 and so does the pumping induced influence of the range for different cases which is according with the above analysis of drawdown illustrated in fig 4 it is interesting to find from fig 5 a that the drawdown in the pumped layer is nearly the same as that in the lower unpumped layer for case 3 at rd 10 and the same phenomenon can be observed from fig 5 a for the drawdowns of case 3 in the two unpumped layers and pumped layer for case 3 if rd 40 additionally the drawdowns along the vertical direction in whole aquifer system under various top and bottom boundaries are shown in fig 5 b to clarify the pumping well of partial penetration is fixed in the middle of the pumped layer having a screen length of 0 5 it can be found that the drawdowns along the vertical direction for all three cases coincide with one another at early and intermediate pumping time td 1 and 102 however the discrepancies among them are significant at a relatively late time of pumping td 104 an interesting observation from fig 5 b can be included that the drawdowns for case 1 and case 2 have symmetry with the axis zd 0 5 at the entire pumping time which are caused by the identical top and bottom boundaries of the two cases and the same thickness and hydraulic parameters of the unpumped layers however the late time drawdown for case 3 has no symmetry and the lower layer drawdown is always smaller than that in the upper layer at correspondingly position of symmetry this implies that the lower layer drawdown is influenced in a greater degree by pumping for case 3 besides the largest drawdown at the axis of symmetry can be seen during the pumping period for all three cases as expected in general one can conclude from fig 5 that the late time drawdown is always affected by the type of top and bottom boundaries at any position within the three layer aquifer system therefore except for the location of piezometer r and z one had better clarify the types of top and bottom boundaries if the late time drawdown data are used for the estimation of parameters of the aquifer system of three layer 3 3 effect of the variable pumping rate firstly it points out that case 3 is hereafter used as an example for demonstration purpose it would be easy to analyze drawdown for case 1 and case 2 in a similar way when there is a need one can know through the above analysis that the pumped aquifer drawdown is mainly influenced by the variable discharge fig 6 shows only the pumped aquifer drawdown for case 3 under different αd at rd 0 1 0 3 and 0 6 note that αd represents the final constant pumping rate one can see that the differences among the type curves for different decay constants can be seen only at intermediate time a greater αd implies that the well discharge declines much faster to reach the final constant pumping rate resulting in smaller drawdowns during the intermediate stage additionally the inflection point of the curve of drawdown versus time near the pumping well is more obvious than that at a distance further away from the pumping well this means that the effect of variable discharge decreases gradually with the increase of the radial distances and eventually disappears completely at some distances far enough from previous study of wen et al 2017 one can use the point of inflection appeared at the stage of the declined pumping discharge at intermediate time to estimate aquifer parameters under this circumstances fig 6 suggests that the observed data of drawdown near the pumping well would be a good choice 3 4 effect of the unpumped layer thickness fig 7 shows the drawdown characteristics for the pumped zd 0 5 and unpumped layer zd 1 1 0 1 at rd 0 1 with a partial penetration well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 for various unpumped layer thickness bd bd 3 bd 2 1 note that the no leakage case or an impermeable unpumped layer is also taken into consideration in this figure for comparison the early and intermediate drawdowns for both pumped aquifer and unpumped layers are not influenced by the change of the thickness of the unpumped layer but the larger the thickness of the unpumped layer the larger late time drawdown can be found in addition fig 7 also illustrates that the pumped aquifer drawdown is significantly influenced by the leakage from adjacent layer if compared to the case of no leakage 3 5 effect of anisotropy because of the generality of the established solution one can easily explore the influence of anisotropy for each layer on the drawdown in this three layer system to be sure two schemes of the aquifer system are considered for comparison the drawdown change in the classical aquitard aquifer aquitard scheme termed scheme a herein will show in the following figures a and the drawdown response will also be illustrated in the following figures b for another scheme termed scheme b herein of a general aquifer system of three layer having the permeability values of the upper and lower layers being one order of magnitude smaller instead of two orders of magnitude smaller as in the default setting than that of the middle pumped layer fig 8 shows the response of drawdown for case 3 in the pumped layer zd 0 5 and in the upper and lower layers zd 1 25 0 25 at rd 0 1 with a partial penetration well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 for various anisotropy of the pumped layer kd 1 kz 1 kr 1 note that kd 1 1 refers to the isotropic case which is included as a reference one can see from fig 8 that the entire aquifer system for scheme a and scheme b is affected by the change of the pumped layer anisotropy almost during the entire pumping time the pumped layer drawdown decreases with an increase of the anisotropy ratio and a larger kd 1 results in larger drawdowns for the upper and lower unpumped layers comparing the drawdowns for scheme a shown in fig 8 a and for scheme b listed in fig 8 b one can see that the drawdown for scheme a is always larger than that for scheme b this is because the difference of the permeability of the unpumped layers and pumped layer for scheme b is not as significant as that for scheme a and the capacity of water supply of the unpumped layers for scheme b is much stronger than that for scheme a therefore it is much easier to obtain the water supply from the top boundary thus a smaller drawdown is seen as illustrated in fig 8 b overall the pumped layer anisotropy is of great importance to ascertaining the drawdown behavior of the entire three layer aquifer system fig 9 demonstrates the drawdown changes for case 3 in an anisotropic pumped layer zd 0 5 kd 1 0 5 and kr 1 10 4 m s and anisotropic upper and lower layers zd 1 25 and 0 25 for various anisotropy ratios of unpumped layer kd kd 2 kz 2 kr 2 kd 3 kz 3 kr 3 at rd 0 1 with a pumping well of partial penetration ld 0 75 and dd 0 25 it should be mentioned that the vertical permeability of the unpumped layer is to be kept on hold in fig 9 where a kz kz 2 kz 3 2 10 6 m s and b kz kz 2 kz 3 2 10 5 m s the case of an isotropic unpumped layer kd 1 is considered in both subgraphs and the case of ignoring the radial flow in unpumped layer is depicted as well for comparison in fig 9 one can obviously see from fig 9 that the influence of various anisotropy ratios on the pumped layer drawdowns almost coincide with the case of the unpumped layer with no horizontal low for scheme a if kd 0 5 however when kd is 0 1 for scheme a the anisotropy of the unpumped layers significantly affects the pumped layer drawdown at the late pumping time as demonstrated in fig 9 a the influence of the unpumped layers anisotropy on the pumped layer drawdown for scheme b is more obvious than that for scheme a at intermediate and late times it can be seen from fig 9 b in addition no matter what the value of anisotropy kd is the change of kd has an appreciable influence on the unpumped layer drawdowns for both scheme a and scheme b finally one still can conclude from fig 9 that the drawdown for scheme a is generally larger than that for scheme b at the same position within the aquifer system of three layer and at the same pumping time overall the radial and vertical flows in the unpumped layer effect of anisotropy should be considered in determining drawdown responses around the pumping well especially to the general case without large contrast of hydraulic conductivity among the unpumped layers and the pumped layer 3 6 the effect of well partial penetration one of the main contributions in this study is that the established general analytical model considered the effect of the well partial penetration fig 10 shows the drawdown changes for case 3 rd 0 1 in the middle pumped layer zd 0 5 and unpumped layers zd 1 25 and 0 25 especially fig 10 a is for various well screen length and ld 1 0 and fig 10 b is for different vertical position of well screen within the middle pumped layer and the well screen length is fixed ld dd 0 5 it can be seen from fig 10 that the length and position of well screen have remarkable effect on the drawdown for all three layers a larger well screen length means that the middle drawdown of pumped layer is closer to the position of well screen and the stored water is much easier to be released resulting in a larger drawdown of pumped layer similarly a smaller drawdown for the upper layer and a greater drawdown for the lower unpumped layer can be seen in fig 10 a for case 3 additionally one can conclude from the above analysis shown in fig 5 b that the closer to the center of the pumped well the larger drawdown can be seen for all three layers and the drawdown for the lower layer is relatively larger than the late time drawdown for the upper layer at the same distance measured from the interface between the pumped layer and unpumped layer for case 3 the center point of the well screen for three different ld 1 0 0 8 and 0 6 is respectively at zd 0 75 0 55 and 0 35 respectively thus the pumped layer drawdown zd 0 5 with ld 0 6 is larger than that with ld 1 0 and smaller than that with ld 0 8 in the same way the upper unpumped layer drawdown zd 1 25 with ld 0 8 is larger than that with ld 0 6 and smaller than that with ld 1 0 and the lower unpumped layer drawdown zd 0 25 with ld 0 8 is larger than that with ld 1 0 and smaller than that with ld 0 6 besides that whatever the pumping well is located at the pumped layer the pumping induced drawdown in the lower unpumped layer is larger than that in the upper layer for case 3 4 discussion based upon the presented solution firstly one can perform quantitative evaluation of the dimensionless drawdown at any points within the general three layer aquifer system with a partial penetration pumping well in the middle layer it is worth emphasizing again that the developed solution not only has no restrictions on the values of the thickness hydraulic conductivity and specific storage for all three layers but that for the length and location of the well screen fixed in the pumped layer thus the generality of the obtained solution is the main contribution of this study secondly it is convenient to explore the influences of variable discharge of pumping aquifer thickness anisotropy well partial penetration and the type of top and bottom boundary on the groundwater flow problems in the aquifer system of three layer besides that the present solutions have a powerful potentiality within geotechnical engineering petroleum engineering and groundwater resource development another important application of the proposed solution is to identify the hydraulic parameters of each layer with adopting the method of parameter estimation in conjunction with field data because the responses for a special case of aquitard aquifer aquifer system is mainly explored for comparison with existing solutions some suggestions can be obtained for using the developed solutions in such a three layer aquifer from the above analysis herein first of all the well structure screen position and length in the pumped layer and the thickness of all layers should be clearly determined secondly the type of boundary at the top and bottom of the aquifer system should be clarified with the use of the observed data of late time drawdown for parameter estimation thirdly the feature of inflection point for the curve of drawdown against time due to the effect of variable discharge can be used to estimate the pumped layer parameters and in such a case the in situ data of drawdown in vicinity of the pumping well need to be collected fourthly the data of early time drawdown for unpumped layers are suggested to determine their specific storage respectively the datum of late time drawdown for unpumped layers can be applied to estimate their values of hydraulic conductivities respectively however a few limitations of this study also need to be addressed firstly the effects of finite radius and wellbore storage on flow cannot be investigated in this study because of the assumption of infinitesimal radius of the pumping well secondly the three dimensional transient responses in three layer aquifer system have not been discussed with the condition of constant drawdown pumping other type of variable rate pumping e g sinusoidal pumping piecewise linear pumping etc thirdly the heterogeneity of the aquifer and varying non uniform thickness of each layer are not taken into consideration fourthly the slope of each layer and the influence of finite or non uniform well skin are not considered as well fifthly the effect of a finite or irregular lateral boundary is not analyzed the investigation for these subjects is much needed in detail in the future in addition it is necessary to further validate the model and the choices of boundary conditions using controlled laboratory experiments and field pumping tests as well in the future 5 summary and conclusions a general semi analytical dimensionless drawdown solution in an anisotropic aquifer system of three layer caused by a partial penetration well pumped at a variable discharge is developed by means of laplace hankel transformation taking account of the interface flow most importantly three widely used types of boundary conditions at the top and bottom are considered that include a zero drawdown boundary for case1 or a no flow boundary for case 2 and a constant head boundary at the top in combination with a no flux boundary at the bottom for case 3 the time domain solutions are evaluated by performing numerical inversion of the transformations of laplace and hankel the present solutions encompass some previously known solutions caused by a full or partial penetration pumping well in an aquifer system of two layer or single layer as subsets the three dimensional transient drawdown in the entire aquifer system pumped by a partial penetration well having a discharge with exponentially decaying function in the middle layer is explored as an example of illustration from this study one can conclude the following main findings 1 the pumped layer drawdown for hantush 1960 with neglecting vertical flow in the pumped layer and horizontal flow in the unpumped layer and the use of the hantush jacob approximation is greater that of this work for case 2 especially at the early pumping time for a fully penetrating well and the unpumped layers drawdown for hantush 1960 are greater than that for present study 2 the effect of variable discharge describing an exponential decline function of pumping time mainly affects the drawdown of the pumped layer and a noticeable feature of inflection points can be seen at the stage of the decay of well discharge and the region nearby the well of pumping 3 the type of boundary at the top and bottom of the aquifer system has no influence on the early and intermediate drawdown but the drawdown at late pumping time for case 3 is greater than that for case 1 and smaller than that for case 2 in all three layers 4 a smaller anisotropy ratio meaning a smaller vertical horizontal permeability ratio of the pumped layer results in a larger pumped layer drawdown and a smaller unpumped layer drawdown over the whole pumping times the anisotropy of the unpumped layers kd mainly affects the drawdown in the unpumped layer and a larger anisotropy ratio kd leads to a larger drawdown of unpumped layer 5 the anisotropy of the unpumped layers significantly affects the drawdown in the aquifer system without large contrast of hydraulic conductivity between the unpumped layers and the pumped layer during entire pumping period 6 the drawdown nearby the pumping well in all three layers are significantly affected by the length and position of well screen in the pumped layer at the entire time and a larger drawdown can be seen at the position of a smaller distance to the midpoint of the well screen feng and zhan 2016 hantush 1964a hantush 1964b hantush 1966 hemker and maas

details written in eqs 29 37 so far semi analytical solutions in the pumped and unpumped layers are derived 
4563,a general semi analytical model for transient flow in a three layered aquifer system with a partial penetration well having a variable discharge of pumping is developed with the consideration of the interface flow on the adjacent layers this general three layer system includes the conventional aquitard aquifer aquitard system as a subset and does not require that the permeability contrasts of different layers must be greater than a few orders of magnitude and does not ignore any flow components either vertical or horizontal in any layer the pumping well of infinitesimal radius is screened at any portion of the middle layer three widely used types of top and bottom boundary conditions are assigned prescribed head case 1 zero flux case 2 or prescribed head at top and zero flux at bottom case 3 laplace domain solutions for dimensionless drawdown are obtained using hankel transformation and associated time domain solutions are evaluated numerically the newly obtained solutions include some available solutions for two or single layer aquifer systems as subsets the drawdowns for individual layers caused by a well with an exponentially decreased discharge are explored as an example of illustration the results indicate that the pumped layer drawdown close to the partially penetrated well is mainly influenced by the variable pumping rate the late time drawdown for all layers is remarkably affected by the chosen types of top and bottom boundary conditions and the drawdown for case 3 is greater than that for case 1 and smaller than that for case 2 additionally the effect of the pumped layer anisotropy on drawdowns in the three layer system is significant and the anisotropy of the unpumped layers significantly affects the drawdown in the whole aquifer system without large contrast of hydraulic conductivity between the unpumped layers and the pumped layer the drawdowns in all three layers are greatly affected by the location and length of well screen and a larger drawdown can be seen at the position that is closer to the middle point of the screen of the partially penetrating pumping well keywords three layer system well partial penetration variable discharge top and bottom boundary semi analytical solution 1 introduction most groundwater flow model concerning a pumping and or injection well will have the pumping and observation wells in the same aquifer yeh and chang 2013 houben 2015 for a multi aquifer system the pumping and observation wells may be in the same aquifer or in different aquifers as different aquifers in a multi aquifer system are hydraulically connected pumping in a specific aquifer will inevitably induce hydraulic responses over the entire multi aquifer system and the observation well in an unpumped aquifer will also record the drawdown information associated with pumping in the pumped aquifer therefore the questions we need to answer are how to interpret the drawdown information collected at an unpumped aquifer from the pumped aquifer and furthermore is that feasible to conduct aquifer characterization and to obtain the aquifer hydraulic parameters when the drawdown information is collected at an unpumped aquifer from the pumped aquifer to answer these questions one must first develop a robust groundwater flow model in a fully coupled multi aquifer system unfortunately the present models on this subject are severely limited to some demanding and often time unrealistic restrictions the present groundwater flow models related to multi layer aquifer systems are usually established by solving the coupled partial differential equation group of groundwater flow explicitly or with a matrix solver bakker 2013 cihan et al 2011 hantush 1967 hunt 2005 moench 1985 neuman and witherspoon 1969 veling and mass 2009 in those models some strong assumptions are often invoked to simplify the system for instance it is commonly assumed that the permeability contrasts among two adjacent aquifers are more than a few orders of magnitude thus flow in the much less permeable layer is assumed to be perpendicular to the layering while the flow in the much greater permeability layer is assumed to be parallel to the layering hantush 1967 neuman and witherspoon 1969 such a simplification may be acceptable for investigating an aquifer aquitard system as the aquitard aquifer permeability contrasts can be indeed as large as a few orders of magnitude hantush 1964a lin et al 2019 neuman 1968 yeh and chang 2013 but this assumption is baseless for a general multi aquifer system in which the permeability contrasts among different layers are much modest another commonly used assumption in present models is that mass exchange between two adjacent aquifers can be treated as a volumetric sink source incorporated into the governing equations of flow in each individual layer the so called hantush jacob assumption hantush and jacob 1955 this assumption is also problematic in the sense that it does not honor the fact that mass exchange between two adjacent layers always occurs at the interfaces of those adjacent layers rather than as a volumetric sink source inside those layers a treatment that can generate considerable errors as documented in numerous investigations e g hantush 1967 feng and zhan 2015 feng et al 2019 2020 zhan and bian 2006 zhu and wen 2020 a third simplification in present models is to assume a constant pumping rate hantush 1964a yeh and chang 2013 the constant pumping rate is desirable but is quite difficult to maintain in actual pumping scenarios which almost always involve variable pumping rates because of many reasons such as the temporary loss of power increased drawdown in the pumping well with time which makes it more difficult to lift water from the pumping well and other constrains in conducting pumping tests in the field chen et al 2020 hantush 1964a mishra et al 2013 sen and altunkaynak 2004 singh 2009 wen et al 2017 in theory numerical modeling can avoid many restrictions mentioned above to investigate a multi aquifer system but it has some issues that are sometimes not easy to resolve for instance it is not straightforward to use a numerical model for aquifer characterization to obtain the aquifer parameters particularly when dealing with a multi aquifer system involving many hydraulic parameters for multiple aquifers when the numerical model has to be used for such a purpose it often involves either trial and error or automatic optimization procedures to minimize the model generated drawdown with the observed drawdown mohanty et al 2013 2019 this process can sometimes lead to non uniqueness of inverted aquifer parameters rahman et al 2020 another issue associated with numerical model is that without a benchmark analytical solution it is unknown how much numerical errors have been involved in the numerical model for a multi aquifer system the numerical errors can be considerable near the interfaces of different aquifers where the aquifer parameters change suddenly neuman 1968 louwyck et al 2012 if one recalls that any numerical approaches no matter they are finite difference finite element boundary element or others essentially involve some sorts of smoothing or average schemes to approximate the mass conservation law in a discrete sense then it is not surprise to know that numerical errors are prone to be large near sharp interfaces cihan et al 2011 neuman 1968 loudyi et al 2007 of course one can use gradually finer meshes when approaching the interfaces of different aquifers to minimize the numerical errors but such a procedure can sometimes increase the computational cost rapidly particularly when dealing with three dimensional 3d flow in a multi aquifer system feng et al 2020 rahman et al 2020 rühaak et al 2008 overall establishing a sufficiently accurate numerical model for groundwater flow in a multi aquifer system is feasible but often time requires considerable preparations and computational cost based on above considerations we are going to establish a robust and generic 3d groundwater flow in a three aquifer system in this investigation the generality of this work is reflected on the following aspects firstly it does not put any constrains on the permeability contrasts among different aquifers involved such a generality will make this work much more appealing to deal with a vast number of cases in actual aquifer setting it also encompasses previous aquifer aquitard two layer system and aquitard aquifer aquitard three layer systems as subsets it can even be applied for an extreme two layer or three layer system such as a fracture rock two layer system or a rock fracture rock three layer system when flow can occur in both fractures and rock matrix furthermore for the rock fracture rock three layer system the rocks adjacent to the fracture can be either identical with the same hydraulic properties or have different lithology and hydraulic properties the two aquifer system investigated by feng et al 2019 is also a subset of this study secondly this study honors the mass exchange among different aquifers as an interface flow phenomenon not as a volumetric sink source term as in the hantush jacob assumption thirdly the pumping rate can be any given function of time instead of being a constant this is a distinctive difference from the three aquifer study of feng et al 2020 involving constant pumping rate fourthly three widely used top and bottom boundary conditions are considered that can be specified as a constant head boundary case1 or a no flux boundary case 2 and a constant head boundary at the top in combination with a no flux boundary at the bottom case 3 this is also in contrast with feng et al 2019 feng et al 2020 which cannot investigate the combined effects of the top and bottom boundaries simultaneously in the following sections semi analytical drawdown solutions in nondimensional forms in a genetic three layer system are obtained by performing laplace hankel transform and eventually the real time solutions are calculated by the method of numerical inversion finally as an example of illustration the characteristics of drawdown are thoroughly investigated due to a partially penetrated well pumped at an exponentially decreased discharge function the results are discussed extensively and their applications are elaborated as well 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical model fig 1 displays an infinitesimal radius well with a variable discharge q t in a general three layer aquifer system of unbound lateral extension the pumping well is partially penetrated in the middle layer of the system with a screen length from d to l shown in this figure each layer of constant thickness is homogeneous and anisotropic three dimensional flow is included in all layers the interface flow at the two neighboring layers is linked with head and flux continuity conditions it is noted that three different cases presented by hantush 1960 are concluded specifically the boundaries at the top and bottom are simultaneously constant head boundaries case 1 no flux boundaries case 2 or a combination of a constant head top boundary and no flux bottom boundary case 3 the cylindrical coordinate origin is at the intersection of the well axis and the bottom of the middle pumped layer according to the conceptual model above the equations that govern the transient drawdown distribution for flow to a pumping well can be given by 1 k ri r r r s i r z t r k zi 2 s i r z t z 2 s si s i r z t t where s r z t denotes drawdown at space coordinate radial distance r l vertical distance z l and time coordinate pumping time t l kr and kz indicate respectively the hydraulic conductivities in the radial and vertical direction l t ss refers to specific storage 1 l and i 1 2 3 designate respectively the middle pumped layer upper layer and lower layer the initial conditions of the aquifer system can be written as 2 s i r z 0 0 the boundary of the aquifer system at infinity yields 3 s i z t 0 the pumping well of infinitesimal diameter is partially penetrated in the middle layer the wellbore boundary condition is subject to hantush 1964a liang et al 2018 4 lim r 0 r s 1 r 0 l z b 1 q t 2 π k r 1 l d d z l 0 0 z d in which q t represents the well discharge of pumping l3t 1 b 1 refers to the thickness of the middle pumped aquifer l it is notable that an assumption of the well discharge uniformly distributed along the screened section of the partially penetrating well is used herein this of course is a simplification for the sake of mathematical modeling fortunately this simplification is proven to be sufficiently accurate for regions that are not extremely close to the pumping well within a few well radii yeh and chang 2013 as an example of illustration the pumping rate used in this study varies exponentially with the pumping time in the form hantush 1964b 1966 wen et al 2017 5 q t q q 1 q e α t which is based on lots of field data and available works chen et al 2020 feng et al 2019 sen and altunkaynak 2004 the symbol q and q 1 represent the final constant and initial well discharge respectively l3t 1 and α designates decay constant obtained from the measured data of pumping t 1 note that one can obtain the analytical solution of variable pumping rate case by using the principle of superposition based on the solution of constant pumping rate case but it is much needed to provide a simple and more direct semi analytical solution if possible with variable discharge as this is commonly encountered in real world pumping tests according to field experiences hantush 1964b 1966 sen and altunkaynak 2004 wen et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the inner well face boundary conditions at the upper and lower unpumped layers yield 6 lim r 0 r s 2 r lim r 0 r s 3 r 0 and the boundary condition at the interface between the middle pumped aquifer and the adjacent upper layer z b 1 requires that 7 s 1 r z t s 2 r z t z b 1 and 8 k z 1 s 1 r z t z k z 2 s 2 r z t z z b 1 the continuity of hydraulic connection between the middle pumped layer and the lower unpumped layer z 0 can be written as 9 s 1 r z t s 3 r z t z 0 and 10 k z 1 s 1 r z t z k z 3 s 3 r z t z z 0 the top boundary condition at the upper unpumped layer z b 2 and the bottom boundary condition at the lower unpumped layer z b 3 of the aquifer system can be in the manner of hantush 1960 and moench 1985 expressed in three ways for case 1 the constant head boundaries at both top and bottom boundaries can be respectively written as 11 s 2 r z t 0 z b 2 and 12 s 3 r z t 0 z b 3 for case 2 the no flux boundary at both top and bottom boundaries yield 13 s 2 r z t z 0 z b 2 and 14 s 3 r z t z 0 z b 3 for case 3 the constant head boundary at the top and the no flux boundary at the bottom are respectively 15 s 2 r z t 0 z b 2 and 16 s 3 r z t z 0 z b 3 it should be remarked that the adopted three different types of top and bottom boundaries expressed in eqs 11 16 are commonly encountered in practice in some cases the upper layer is covered with ponded water the upper and lower layers are respectively overlain and underlain a layer of a highly transmissivity or the induced drawdown at the top bottom boundary is not affected by pumping under such conditions the constant head condition can be imposed at the boundary on the

in the unpumped layers as in previous works of hantush 1960 moench 1985 and chen et al 2020 the condition for this assumption is that the permeability of the middle pumped aquifer is usually larger at least two orders of magnitude than that of the upper and lower aquitards additionally the transient dimensionless solutions in the three layer aquifer system caused by a partially penetrating constant

of drawdown agree with the solutions of feng et al 2019 describing flow in a two layer aquifer system pumped by a partial penetration well of a variable constant discharge subject to a zero drawdown

by feng and zhan 2015 that can be applied to investigate the drawdown caused by a pumping well of partial penetration in an aquitard aquifer system where the horizontal flow in the upper layer is neglected and a zero drawdown condition can be imposed at the top boundary 2 3 3 special cases in a single layer aquifer if ignoring the leakage effect between two adjacent layers the present pumped layer drawdown solutions can reduce to the solution of hantush 1964a for flow in a confined aquifer due to a partially penetrated well with constant pumping rate q 1 d 1 when the pumped layer is fully penetrated by a well with an exponentially decreasing discharge and leakage is not considered eqs 34b 34d collapse to the drawdown solution of wen et al 2017 additionally the classical solution of theis is also included in the new obtained solution when q 1 d 1 2 4 numerical inversion of the solutions so far the laplace domain solutions of nondimensional drawdown for diverse cases are developed in this study a numerical integration algorithm ogata 2005 with the method using the zeros of the bessel functions as nodes can be performed to calculate the infinite integral associated with the transformation of hankel and the method of de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 is able to be applied to solve the transformation of laplace finally one can apply the inversion of hankel transformation to obtain the semi analytical solution in laplace domain and apply the inversion of laplace transformation to obtain the final time domain solution for the inversion of hankel transformation the ogata 2005 method has two free parameters h the step size and n the number of steps performed which respectively determine the resolution and upper limit of the integration grid these can be modified to accurately transform any function that theoretically converges and we found that h 0 00001 and n 170 are enough for the inverse hankel transformation and 40 terms of the series used in de hoog algorithm has sufficient accuracy for the inverse solutions in this study the other more details for verification and validation of the method have been proven and can be found in the study of de hoog et al 1982 ogata 2005 feng et al 2020 and liang et al 2018 which is not discussed herein 3 results the dimensionless drawdown response due to a partial penetration well pumped at an exponentially decreasing discharge is explored in the following from several perspectives default values for realistic aquifers are used in the following analysis b 1 20 m b 2 30 m b 3 10 m kr 1 kz 1 10 4 ms 1 kr 2 kz 2 10 6 ms 1 kr 3 kz 3 10 6 ms 1 ss 1 2 10 5 m 1 ss 2 10 3 m 1 ss 3 10 6 m 1 q 1 0 005 m3s 1 q 0 002 m3s 1 one can see that the upper and lower unpumped layers have the same hydraulic properties of aquitard composed of clay soil for simplicity and middle pumped layer may be composed of sand soils in reality under this circumstance the three layer system becomes a commonly investigated three layer aquitard aquifer aquitard system hantush 1960 moench 1985 wen et al 2011 chen et al 2020 which will be analyzed for comparison with existing works though the presented solution applies to a general three layer aquifer systems with no restrictions on the hydraulic parameter e g permeability specific storage and the thickness of each layer aquifer anisotropy and different permeability contrasts among individual layers will also be explored to show the importance of considering both vertical and horizontal flows for each of the three layers no matter the layer is pumped or unpumped 3 1 comparison with available solutions fig 2 a illustrates the drawdown responses of the pumped layer at rd 0 1 and zd 0 5 caused by a full penetration pumping well ld 1 dd 0 in an aquitard aquifer aquitard system case 3 in this study hantush 1960 an aquitard aquifer system feng and zhan 2015 feng et al 2019 and a confined aquifer system theis 1935 wen et al 2017 fig 2 b shows the pumped aquifer drawdown at the same location as fig 2 a due to a partial penetration pumping well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 in present solution for case 3 solutions of feng and zhan 2015 and feng et al 2019 for a leaky confined aquifer system and hantush 1964a for a nonleaky confined aquifer system both the cases of constant q 1 d 1 and variable discharge q 1 d 2 5 αd 0 8 are considered in this figure no matter what the well discharge is under the circumstance of a full penetration well the early time drawdown for almost all study agrees with one another except for the modified hantush 1960 solution the results are slightly larger than that of modified hantush 1960 for an aquitard aquifer aquitard system if using the hantush jacob approximation and the assumption of only considering the radial flow in the pumped layer and vertical flow in the unpumped aquitard because the leakage effect is regarded as a sink source term introduced in the pumped aquifer governing equation in hantush 1960 it is no strange to see a smaller drawdown in early time as demonstrated in fig 2 the drawdown of theis 1935 and wen et al 2017 with a full penetration well in fig 2 a or hantush 1964a with a partial penetration well in fig 2 b is always larger than the others with the increasing of pumping time due to no leakage from adjacent layers the intermediate time drawdown in a leaky confined aquifer is greater than that in an aquitard aquifer aquitard system which may be caused by less leakage into the pumped aquifer derived entirely from the upper aquitard storage the late time steady state drawdowns can be found in two layer and three layer aquifer system and their values are almost the same as each other moreover the time to approach the steady state for two layer aquifer system feng and zhan 2015 feng et al 2019 is much earlier than that for three layer aquifer system hantush 1960 present study for case 3 this is to be understood that the water from top boundary of the aquifer system of two layer is also much quicker to supply the pumped aquifer because the pumped aquifer drawdown is not influenced by the storage of the lower layer in the aquifer system of three layer comparison of the dimensionless drawdown solution induced by a full penetration pumping well obtained by this study for case 3 and modified hantush 1960 one can only see the difference at early and intermediate times when td is smaller than about 102 as demonstrated in fig 2 a this can be attributed to the following aspects firstly the hantush jacob approximation is used in modified hantush 1960 secondly the flow in the radial direction of aquitard and flow in the vertical direction of the pumped aquifer are not taken into consideration in modified hantush 1960 however the present study takes account of the horizontal and vertical flows in each layer as we as treat the leakage across the two adjacent layers as continuity boundary conditions rather than a simplified volumetric sink source term accordingly our general analytical model can reflect the actual leakage process therefore one can conclude that the use of the hantush jacob approximation should be deliberated especially at the early pumping time for a fully penetrating well one can see from fig 2 b that the storage of lower unpumped aquitard primarily affects the drawdown distribution for the three layer aquifer system of case 3 at the intermediate pumping time signifying that the hydraulic parameters of lower aquitard can be estimated by using the observed data at this stage in additional more comparative analysis for the pumped aquifer drawdown in a confined aquifer with a pumping well of full penetration theis 1935 wen et al 2017 or of partial penetration hautush 1964 and in a two layer aquifer with a full partial penetration well feng and zhan 2015 feng et al 2019 can be found in the work of feng et al 2019 which is not repeated herein it should be remarked that the typical curves of drawdown versus pumping time have two inflection points during the decaying period of pumping rate and more discussion and explanation for this feature can be found in wen et al 2017 at last one can see from fig 2 a in comparison with fig 2 b that the pumped layer drawdown due to a partial penetration pumping well is greater than that a full penetration pumping well at the same value of pumping time indicating that the effect of well partial penetration needs to be considered 3 2 effect of various top and bottom boundaries fig 3 shows the changes of drawdown at rd 0 1 in the middle pumped layer zd 0 5 in the upper layer zd 1 2 and in the lower unpumped layer zd 0 4 for case 1 a case 2 b and case 3 c under the condition of a well of full penetration ld 1 dd 0 the solution of hantush 1960 is included in this figure for comparison purposes and the case of no leakage wen et al 2017 is also considered as a reference the curves of drawdown versus time for the pumped layer obtained by this study and hantush 1960 have almost the same feature during the entire pumping stage and their deviations are mainly occurred at the stage of 10 2 td 101 as illustrated in the subgraphs of fig 3 with three different cases the deviations are caused by using the hantush jacob assumption for the solution of hantush 1960 additionally as for the drawdown response in the two unpumped layers one can find from fig 3 that the drawdown developed by this study is always larger than that of hantush 1960 as the pumping time goes by and a relatively stable error between them can be found at late time this is due to fact that the influence of radial flow in the unpumped layer is ignored by hantush 1960 what is more fig 3 b and fig 3 c demonstrate that the drawdown for the lower unpumped layer is nearly identical to that for the pumped layer if only taking account of the vertical flow in the unpumped layer in other words whether the radial flow in the unpumped layer is overlooked or not one can see that from the comparison of drawdowns in the pumped layer with that in the unpumped layer for case 2 and case 3 to compare the drawdowns under different boundaries at the top and bottom of the aquifer system fig 4 displays the drawdown changes at rd 0 1 in the pumped layer zd 0 5 and in the unpumped layers zd 1 2 and zd 0 4 for all three cases with a partial penetration pumping well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 notably the no leaky case modified hantush 1964a is plotted as a reference in this figure fig 4 shows that the influence of the type of top and boundary can be ignored in exploring drawdown at the early and intermediate pumping time however its influence on the late time drawdown behavior is obvious and one can find that the drawdowns for cases 1 and 3 reach steady state at late pumping stage because of the unlimited water supply stemmed from the top zero drawdown boundary in addition the late time drawdown for case 3 is greater than that for case 1 and smaller than that for case 2 this is because the constant head boundary at the top and bottom in case 1 can give steady and unlimited supply of water thus leading to the smallest drawdown among three cases in another aspect the no flux top and bottom boundaries in case 2 cannot furnish any supply of water thus the largest drawdown can be seen among three cases in this figure fig 4 also illustrates that the drawdown for case 2 increases indefinitely with pumping time and finally parallels with that of the no leakage case this is caused by the no flow boundary at the top and bottom furthermore one cannot see the inflection point of the type curves for the unpumped layer indicating that the influence of variable discharge mainly affects the pumped layer drawdown this is because the drawdown response for the unpumped layer appears nearly at the end of the intermediate time and the influence of variable discharge is very small and can be neglected at this stage thus the inflection point cannot be found to further investigate the influence of various top and bottom boundaries on drawdown fig 5 is plotted to demonstrate the drawdown responses in all layers using typical curves of a sd versus r d zd 0 5 1 2 and 0 4 at td 104 b sd versus z d at rd 0 1 with a partial penetration pumping well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 fig 5 a shows that the late time drawdown at any radial distance rd for case 3 is greater than that for case 1 and smaller than that for case 2 and so does the pumping induced influence of the range for different cases which is according with the above analysis of drawdown illustrated in fig 4 it is interesting to find from fig 5 a that the drawdown in the pumped layer is nearly the same as that in the lower unpumped layer for case 3 at rd 10 and the same phenomenon can be observed from fig 5 a for the drawdowns of case 3 in the two unpumped layers and pumped layer for case 3 if rd 40 additionally the drawdowns along the vertical direction in whole aquifer system under various top and bottom boundaries are shown in fig 5 b to clarify the pumping well of partial penetration is fixed in the middle of the pumped layer having a screen length of 0 5 it can be found that the drawdowns along the vertical direction for all three cases coincide with one another at early and intermediate pumping time td 1 and 102 however the discrepancies among them are significant at a relatively late time of pumping td 104 an interesting observation from fig 5 b can be included that the drawdowns for case 1 and case 2 have symmetry with the axis zd 0 5 at the entire pumping time which are caused by the identical top and bottom boundaries of the two cases and the same thickness and hydraulic parameters of the unpumped layers however the late time drawdown for case 3 has no symmetry and the lower layer drawdown is always smaller than that in the upper layer at correspondingly position of symmetry this implies that the lower layer drawdown is influenced in a greater degree by pumping for case 3 besides the largest drawdown at the axis of symmetry can be seen during the pumping period for all three cases as expected in general one can conclude from fig 5 that the late time drawdown is always affected by the type of top and bottom boundaries at any position within the three layer aquifer system therefore except for the location of piezometer r and z one had better clarify the types of top and bottom boundaries if the late time drawdown data are used for the estimation of parameters of the aquifer system of three layer 3 3 effect of the variable pumping rate firstly it points out that case 3 is hereafter used as an example for demonstration purpose it would be easy to analyze drawdown for case 1 and case 2 in a similar way when there is a need one can know through the above analysis that the pumped aquifer drawdown is mainly influenced by the variable discharge fig 6 shows only the pumped aquifer drawdown for case 3 under different αd at rd 0 1 0 3 and 0 6 note that αd represents the final constant pumping rate one can see that the differences among the type curves for different decay constants can be seen only at intermediate time a greater αd implies that the well discharge declines much faster to reach the final constant pumping rate resulting in smaller drawdowns during the intermediate stage additionally the inflection point of the curve of drawdown versus time near the pumping well is more obvious than that at a distance further away from the pumping well this means that the effect of variable discharge decreases gradually with the increase of the radial distances and eventually disappears completely at some distances far enough from previous study of wen et al 2017 one can use the point of inflection appeared at the stage of the declined pumping discharge at intermediate time to estimate aquifer parameters under this circumstances fig 6 suggests that the observed data of drawdown near the pumping well would be a good choice 3 4 effect of the unpumped layer thickness fig 7 shows the drawdown characteristics for the pumped zd 0 5 and unpumped layer zd 1 1 0 1 at rd 0 1 with a partial penetration well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 for various unpumped layer thickness bd bd 3 bd 2 1 note that the no leakage case or an impermeable unpumped layer is also taken into consideration in this figure for comparison the early and intermediate drawdowns for both pumped aquifer and unpumped layers are not influenced by the change of the thickness of the unpumped layer but the larger the thickness of the unpumped layer the larger late time drawdown can be found in addition fig 7 also illustrates that the pumped aquifer drawdown is significantly influenced by the leakage from adjacent layer if compared to the case of no leakage 3 5 effect of anisotropy because of the generality of the established solution one can easily explore the influence of anisotropy for each layer on the drawdown in this three layer system to be sure two schemes of the aquifer system are considered for comparison the drawdown change in the classical aquitard aquifer aquitard scheme termed scheme a herein will show in the following figures a and the drawdown response will also be illustrated in the following figures b for another scheme termed scheme b herein of a general aquifer system of three layer having the permeability values of the upper and lower layers being one order of magnitude smaller instead of two orders of magnitude smaller as in the default setting than that of the middle pumped layer fig 8 shows the response of drawdown for case 3 in the pumped layer zd 0 5 and in the upper and lower layers zd 1 25 0 25 at rd 0 1 with a partial penetration well ld 0 75 dd 0 25 for various anisotropy of the pumped layer kd 1 kz 1 kr 1 note that kd 1 1 refers to the isotropic case which is included as a reference one can see from fig 8 that the entire aquifer system for scheme a and scheme b is affected by the change of the pumped layer anisotropy almost during the entire pumping time the pumped layer drawdown decreases with an increase of the anisotropy ratio and a larger kd 1 results in larger drawdowns for the upper and lower unpumped layers comparing the drawdowns for scheme a shown in fig 8 a and for scheme b listed in fig 8 b one can see that the drawdown for scheme a is always larger than that for scheme b this is because the difference of the permeability of the unpumped layers and pumped layer for scheme b is not as significant as that for scheme a and the capacity of water supply of the unpumped layers for scheme b is much stronger than that for scheme a therefore it is much easier to obtain the water supply from the top boundary thus a smaller drawdown is seen as illustrated in fig 8 b overall the pumped layer anisotropy is of great importance to ascertaining the drawdown behavior of the entire three layer aquifer system fig 9 demonstrates the drawdown changes for case 3 in an anisotropic pumped layer zd 0 5 kd 1 0 5 and kr 1 10 4 m s and anisotropic upper and lower layers zd 1 25 and 0 25 for various anisotropy ratios of unpumped layer kd kd 2 kz 2 kr 2 kd 3 kz 3 kr 3 at rd 0 1 with a pumping well of partial penetration ld 0 75 and dd 0 25 it should be mentioned that the vertical permeability of the unpumped layer is to be kept on hold in fig 9 where a kz kz 2 kz 3 2 10 6 m s and b kz kz 2 kz 3 2 10 5 m s the case of an isotropic unpumped layer kd 1 is considered in both subgraphs and the case of ignoring the radial flow in unpumped layer is depicted as well for comparison in fig 9 one can obviously see from fig 9 that the influence of various anisotropy ratios on the pumped layer drawdowns almost coincide with the case of the unpumped layer with no horizontal low for scheme a if kd 0 5 however when kd is 0 1 for scheme a the anisotropy of the unpumped layers significantly affects the pumped layer drawdown at the late pumping time as demonstrated in fig 9 a the influence of the unpumped layers anisotropy on the pumped layer drawdown for scheme b is more obvious than that for scheme a at intermediate and late times it can be seen from fig 9 b in addition no matter what the value of anisotropy kd is the change of kd has an appreciable influence on the unpumped layer drawdowns for both scheme a and scheme b finally one still can conclude from fig 9 that the drawdown for scheme a is generally larger than that for scheme b at the same position within the aquifer system of three layer and at the same pumping time overall the radial and vertical flows in the unpumped layer effect of anisotropy should be considered in determining drawdown responses around the pumping well especially to the general case without large contrast of hydraulic conductivity among the unpumped layers and the pumped layer 3 6 the effect of well partial penetration one of the main contributions in this study is that the established general analytical model considered the effect of the well partial penetration fig 10 shows the drawdown changes for case 3 rd 0 1 in the middle pumped layer zd 0 5 and unpumped layers zd 1 25 and 0 25 especially fig 10 a is for various well screen length and ld 1 0 and fig 10 b is for different vertical position of well screen within the middle pumped layer and the well screen length is fixed ld dd 0 5 it can be seen from fig 10 that the length and position of well screen have remarkable effect on the drawdown for all three layers a larger well screen length means that the middle drawdown of pumped layer is closer to the position of well screen and the stored water is much easier to be released resulting in a larger drawdown of pumped layer similarly a smaller drawdown for the upper layer and a greater drawdown for the lower unpumped layer can be seen in fig 10 a for case 3 additionally one can conclude from the above analysis shown in fig 5 b that the closer to the center of the pumped well the larger drawdown can be seen for all three layers and the drawdown for the lower layer is relatively larger than the late time drawdown for the upper layer at the same distance measured from the interface between the pumped layer and unpumped layer for case 3 the center point of the well screen for three different ld 1 0 0 8 and 0 6 is respectively at zd 0 75 0 55 and 0 35 respectively thus the pumped layer drawdown zd 0 5 with ld 0 6 is larger than that with ld 1 0 and smaller than that with ld 0 8 in the same way the upper unpumped layer drawdown zd 1 25 with ld 0 8 is larger than that with ld 0 6 and smaller than that with ld 1 0 and the lower unpumped layer drawdown zd 0 25 with ld 0 8 is larger than that with ld 1 0 and smaller than that with ld 0 6 besides that whatever the pumping well is located at the pumped layer the pumping induced drawdown in the lower unpumped layer is larger than that in the upper layer for case 3 4 discussion based upon the presented solution firstly one can perform quantitative evaluation of the dimensionless drawdown at any points within the general three layer aquifer system with a partial penetration pumping well in the middle layer it is worth emphasizing again that the developed solution not only has no restrictions on the values of the thickness hydraulic conductivity and specific storage for all three layers but that for the length and location of the well screen fixed in the pumped layer thus the generality of the obtained solution is the main contribution of this study secondly it is convenient to explore the influences of variable discharge of pumping aquifer thickness anisotropy well partial penetration and the type of top and bottom boundary on the groundwater flow problems in the aquifer system of three layer besides that the present solutions have a powerful potentiality within geotechnical engineering petroleum engineering and groundwater resource development another important application of the proposed solution is to identify the hydraulic parameters of each layer with adopting the method of parameter estimation in conjunction with field data because the responses for a special case of aquitard aquifer aquifer system is mainly explored for comparison with existing solutions some suggestions can be obtained for using the developed solutions in such a three layer aquifer from the above analysis herein first of all the well structure screen position and length in the pumped layer and the thickness of all layers should be clearly determined secondly the type of boundary at the top and bottom of the aquifer system should be clarified with the use of the observed data of late time drawdown for parameter estimation thirdly the feature of inflection point for the curve of drawdown against time due to the effect of variable discharge can be used to estimate the pumped layer parameters and in such a case the in situ data of drawdown in vicinity of the pumping well need to be collected fourthly the data of early time drawdown for unpumped layers are suggested to determine their specific storage respectively the datum of late time drawdown for unpumped layers can be applied to estimate their values of hydraulic conductivities respectively however a few limitations of this study also need to be addressed firstly the effects of finite radius and wellbore storage on flow cannot be investigated in this study because of the assumption of infinitesimal radius of the pumping well secondly the three dimensional transient responses in three layer aquifer system have not been discussed with the condition of constant drawdown pumping other type of variable rate pumping e g sinusoidal pumping piecewise linear pumping etc thirdly the heterogeneity of the aquifer and varying non uniform thickness of each layer are not taken into consideration fourthly the slope of each layer and the influence of finite or non uniform well skin are not considered as well fifthly the effect of a finite or irregular lateral boundary is not analyzed the investigation for these subjects is much needed in detail in the future in addition it is necessary to further validate the model and the choices of boundary conditions using controlled laboratory experiments and field pumping tests as well in the future 5 summary and conclusions a general semi analytical dimensionless drawdown solution in an anisotropic aquifer system of three layer caused by a partial penetration well pumped at a variable discharge is developed by means of laplace hankel transformation taking account of the interface flow most importantly three widely used types of boundary conditions at the top and bottom are considered that include a zero drawdown boundary for case1 or a no flow boundary for case 2 and a constant head boundary at the top in combination with a no flux boundary at the bottom for case 3 the time domain solutions are evaluated by performing numerical inversion of the transformations of laplace and hankel the present solutions encompass some previously known solutions caused by a full or partial penetration pumping well in an aquifer system of two layer or single layer as subsets the three dimensional transient drawdown in the entire aquifer system pumped by a partial penetration well having a discharge with exponentially decaying function in the middle layer is explored as an example of illustration from this study one can conclude the following main findings 1 the pumped layer drawdown for hantush 1960 with neglecting vertical flow in the pumped layer and horizontal flow in the unpumped layer and the use of the hantush jacob approximation is greater that of this work for case 2 especially at the early pumping time for a fully penetrating well and the unpumped layers drawdown for hantush 1960 are greater than that for present study 2 the effect of variable discharge describing an exponential decline function of pumping time mainly affects the drawdown of the pumped layer and a noticeable feature of inflection points can be seen at the stage of the decay of well discharge and the region nearby the well of pumping 3 the type of boundary at the top and bottom of the aquifer system has no influence on the early and intermediate drawdown but the drawdown at late pumping time for case 3 is greater than that for case 1 and smaller than that for case 2 in all three layers 4 a smaller anisotropy ratio meaning a smaller vertical horizontal permeability ratio of the pumped layer results in a larger pumped layer drawdown and a smaller unpumped layer drawdown over the whole pumping times the anisotropy of the unpumped layers kd mainly affects the drawdown in the unpumped layer and a larger anisotropy ratio kd leads to a larger drawdown of unpumped layer 5 the anisotropy of the unpumped layers significantly affects the drawdown in the aquifer system without large contrast of hydraulic conductivity between the unpumped layers and the pumped layer during entire pumping period 6 the drawdown nearby the pumping well in all three layers are significantly affected by the length and position of well screen in the pumped layer at the entire time and a larger drawdown can be seen at the position of a smaller distance to the midpoint of the well screen feng and zhan 2016 hantush 1964a hantush 1964b hantush 1966 hemker and maas

4564,surface displacements measured by the global navigation satellite system gnss integrate the elastic response of the solid earth to regional and local hydrologic loading signals and provide an opportunity for near real time monitoring of terrestrial water storage variations here we estimate the spectral information of hydrology induced vertical surface deformation based on spherical slepian basis functions and recover the daily changes in continental water storage over mainland china from january 2010 to december 2019 our inversion results depending on a sparsely distributed gnss network indicate the largest seasonal fluctuation of hydrological mass loads in southwestern china the gnss inferred equivalent water height has an annual amplitude of up to 314 mm which is greater than 243 mm from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and 150 mm from the global land data assimilation system gldas we also find notable seasonal water oscillations of 153 166 mm in the middle and lower yangtze river basin this feature appears in the gnss inversion model and grace mascon solutions but is invisible in the gldas model mostly indicating the existence of significant changes in surface water storage that is unmodeled in the gldas model there is board agreement in the water estimates derived from multiple data sets in south china in contrast to weak temporal coherence of various water estimates in north china we also demonstrate the ability of gnss for tracking the drought and wet periods which can serve as an independent means to characterize hydrological extremes our study emphasizes that a sparse gnss network can still be considered as a complementary tool to map large scale spatiotemporal variations of water storage and benefit the hydrological community for assessing water storage changes and hydrological dynamics keywords gnss slepian basis functions terrestrial water storage seasonal water oscillations hydrological dynamics 1 introduction resolving the geographical and temporal patterns of terrestrial water provide critical insights for studying hydrological dynamics climatic variations and water resources management improvements in the hydrological modeling and observation technology allow us to precisely measure and continuously monitor the redistribution of earth s water at different temporal and spatial scales hydrological models as a representation of terrestrial hydrologic processes in mathematical models are widely applied to address climate variations and human stresses on global water resources hydrological models generally simplify complex hydrological processes based on a limited representation of the water energy cycle thereby they are usually unable to capture the complete hydrological components and easily underestimate climate and human induced water storage changes scanlon et al 2018 for example the noah land surface model in the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 only contains soil moisture of 0 2 m depth snow water equivalent and total canopy water storage and ignores the influence of surface water lakes rivers and reservoir deep groundwater and anthropogenic components space based advanced gravimetric measurement techniques for instance the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace provide integrated information on total water storage rather than individual hydrological components the grace and grace fo dual satellite missions provide a revolutionary tool for precisely measuring the earth s geopotential field and for continuously tracking global mass changes harig and simons 2012 tapley et al 2019 nevertheless grace has coarse temporal monthly sampling and spatial resolution approximately 350 km trautmann et al 2018 and is insensitive to high frequency and fine scale terrestrial water storage variations enzminger et al 2018 knappe et al 2019 ground based gnss instruments can accurately measure subtle deformation of earth s surface with millimeter level precision and have been successfully applied in tracking the water mass changes at different spatiotemporal scales argus et al 2014 2017 borsa et al 2014 enzminger et al 2018 fu et al 2015 heki 2001 jin and zhang 2016 johnson et al 2017 knappe et al 2019 milliner et al 2018 the continuously operating gnss networks provide an additional means to measure the water induced surface elastic deformation such as short duration changes associated with storms geng et al 2012 milliner et al 2018 and long term variability related to climate changes argus et al 2014 2017 fu et al 2015 in a densely instrumented region gnss measurements could resolve fine scale spatial variations in terrestrial water storage argus et al 2014 2017 fu et al 2015 hsu et al 2020 allowing for capturing local hydrologic changes at watershed scales of tens of kilometers to regional loading changes with distances up to 300 km knappe et al 2019 more importantly a dense gnss array presents a new tool for near real time monitoring of surface motions associated with meteorological extremes characterized by significant water mass fluctuations with ultra low latency 1 day which leads to grand potential in operational hydrological monitoring and facilitates the early warning systems for disasters associated with hydrometeorological extremes such as storm surges geng et al 2012 milliner et al 2018 and droughts chew and small 2014 most published gnss inferred water mass variations as mentioned in the previous paragraph are based on the spatial domain convolution approach namely green s function method when the spatial coverage of gnss networks is insufficient the green s function approach argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 jin and zhang 2016 is not an ideal way for the investigation of terrestrial hydrological mass variations han and razeghi 2017 introduced a new methodology based on the localized spherical harmonic basis functions generally called spherical slepian basis functions slepian 1983 to recover continental not global hydrological mass variations with the spatial resolution in line with the grace satellite mission the slepian functions are considered as an optimal alternative to traditional spherical harmonics to deal with geophysical signals over spatially limited regions which are introduced to improve the precision and accuracy of a nonglobal modeling application with a limited observational bandwidth harig et al 2015 based on the localized spherical harmonic functions widespread geoscientific applications associated with gravity variations are developed such as ice mass loss in greenland harig and simons 2012 antarctica gao et al 2019 harig and simons 2015 arctic harig and simons 2016 and iceland von hippel and harig 2019 postseismic gravity changes following great earthquakes han et al 2008 regional lunar gravity modeling han 2008 and hydrologic and atmospheric mass variations at the continental scale han and razeghi 2017 in this study we aim at investigating the terrestrial water storage anomalies at the continental scale using the continuous measurements in a sparse gnss network our inversion modeling relies on the localized spherical harmonic slepian basis functions and recovers daily hydrologic mass variations using vertical surface displacements based on the time varying inversion scheme we examine the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of continental water storage changes in mainland china and validate our gnss inverted water estimates against grace gldas and precipitation products we investigate the correlation coefficients and phase lags between meteorological precipitation and water storage changes in ten drainage basins located in mainland china we also use the gnss based water estimates to characterize the hydrological extremes e g droughts and floods this study not only illustrates the spatiotemporal patterns of terrestrial water storage changes but also provides evidence for practical applications of the detection of extreme climate events in mainland china 2 materials 2 1 study area china fig 1 is situated in east asia adjacent to the western pacific ocean and is characterized by multifarious geographic features in topography landscape and climate the topography in china features a three step staircase with an eastward descending trend and diversified landscapes consisting of plateaus plains basins foothills and mountains owing to the special geographical locations and complicated topographical conditions the climate is diverse including temperate subtropical and tropical monsoon climate from northern to southern portions of eastern china temperate continental climate in northeast china and plateau mountain climate in the tibetan plateau annual precipitation attains the largest in southeast china more than 2000 mm and gradually decreases toward the northwest below 200 mm water resources are unevenly distributed in different regions for example northwest china centrally located in the eurasian continent is facing serious water shortage whereas south china has abundant water resources due to rich monsoonal rainfall and dense river systems in addition an increase in anthropogenic activities e g water withdrawals in north china and dam projects in southwest china and the middle lower yangtze river may break original hydrological cycles and lead to the growth of hydrological disasters therefore investigating spatiotemporal evolutions of terrestrial water storage variations is critical for our understanding of the hydrological cycle and is conducive to water resource management in mainland china 2 2 data and preprocessing 2 2 1 gnss vertical time series we collect the gnss position time series in 2010 2019 from the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc the gnss data are accessible in the china earthquake data center cedc http www eqdsc com established by the first monitoring and application center china earthquake administration cea the gnss measurements are processed with the gamit globk version 10 4 package herring et al 2018 and the detailed data processing procedures are summarized in text s1 to image the daily terrestrial water storage changes over mainland china the daily position solutions at 250 stations fig 1 and table s2 are carefully selected and reprocessed for studying the hydrological loading deformation in our study see more details in text s2 the geophysical fluid loading products which are released by the earth system modeling group at deutsches geoforschungszentrum esmgfz http esmdata gfz potsdam de 8080 repository are utilized to remove the non tidal oceanic and atmospheric loading displacements in the center of figure cf frame of the solid earth surface the annual amplitudes of atmospheric loads range from 1 3 to 6 6 mm in the gnss vertical position time series fig s1 the earth s surface periodically deforms under the non tidal oceanic loads with the annual amplitudes of about 1 0 2 5 mm along the coastal regions in contrast to that of 0 5 mm in the inland regions fig s2 the postglacial rebound effect causes crustal uplift of 0 3 to 0 6 mm yr across china fig s3 and is corrected by using the ice 6g d model purcell et al 2016 we then fit each vertical time series with a position a linear velocity annual and semiannual motions instrument and coseismic offsets and postseismic relaxation terms jiang et al 2017b including the 2011 tohoku oki earthquake and the 2015 gorkha earthquake note that the postseismic relaxation characterized by a logarithmic function is only applied to stations which show visible coseismic displacements to implement an inversion model for water storage variations we remove the long term linear trend offsets and postseismic deformation from the raw time series to study crustal motions associated with water cycles since we rely on the continuous time series with an identical sampling rate for our time variant inversion missing data are filled by using the gnss missing data interpolation software gmis liu et al 2018 this dynamic spatiotemporal interpolation method applies the kriged kalman filter and has an excellent performance in handling continuous and random data gaps based on the network coordinate time series we implement the spatiotemporal interpolation method see more details in text s3 and obtain the filtered time series with data gaps filled shown in fig s5 for an example 2 2 2 grace mascon solutions the new mascon solutions based on grace rl06 downloaded from the center for space research csr http www2 csr utexas edu grace are considered to validate our inversion results of equivalent water height ewh changes we use the csr grace rl06 mascon solutions defined at 0 25 rectangle grids covering the time span from january 2010 to june 2017 the deadline of the available data including 17 months with missing data all well characterized corrections including the c20 estimates from satellite laser ranging slr degree 1 coefficients atmospheric and oceanic effects and glacial isostatic adjustment gia components have been applied to the newly released grace mascon products save 2019 save et al 2016 when using the water products from the csr mascon solutions we do not need to use additional smoothing empirical de striping filtering or scaling factors to compare with gnss and gldas based water height time series the missing grace data are filled by the spline interpolation method which gives the interpolated values based on a cubic interpolation of the values at neighboring points 2 2 3 gldas data product we consider the monthly products from the gldas 2 1 noah land surface model from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center ges disc https disc gsfc nasa gov to investigate the spatiotemporal distributions of near surface water storage changes the hydrological products are sampled at 0 25 0 25 spatial grids extending from 180 0 w to180 0 e and 60 0 n to 90 0 s we calculate the total water contents by summing soil moistures at depths of 0 to 2 m snow water equivalent and total canopy water storage we use the gramat code to examine the temporal features of regional water storage changes which applies an area weighted scheme to convert time dependent grided data within a boundary of interest to the water storage time series feng 2019 2 2 4 surface precipitation product to probe the relationship between precipitation and terrestrial water mass changes we collect the monthly precipitation products from the china meteorological data service center of the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn this dataset integrates the measurements from 2472 surface meteorological stations in mainland china the released precipitation products are made into 0 5 0 5 grids extending from longitudes 72 e to 136 e and latitudes 18 n to 54 n based on the spatial interpolation method of thin plate spline which finds a minimally bended smooth surface that passes through all given points 3 methodology 3 1 slepian basis functions based on the harmonic spectral analysis theory any time variant truncated geophysical signals f l θ λ t of degree l can be written in the global spherical harmonic expression as follows 1 f l θ λ t a l 1 l m l l f lm t y lm θ λ where y lm θ λ is the spherical harmonic functions at geographical coordinates colatitude θ longitude λ f lm t represents the harmonic coefficient at degree l and order m a denotes the radius of the earth when implementing a regional non global model slepian basis functions should be an alternative to traditional spherical harmonic functions which are only practical for global modeling detailed discussions associated with slepian functions are presented in previous studies harig and simons 2012 simons and dahlen 2006 simons et al 2006 we can write the truncated signal with the bandwidth l in slepian basis functions as follows 2 f l θ λ t a α 1 l 1 2 s α t g α θ λ where g α θ λ is the α th slepian basis function s α t is the corresponding coefficient the linchpin is to make a linear transformation from y lm θ λ to g α θ λ which should be exact as follows 3 g α θ λ l 0 l m l l g α l m y lm θ λ where g α l m is the l th degree m th order spherical harmonic coefficient of the α th slepian function to a given l it comprises l 1 2 group orthogonal basis functions the optimal one is obtained when the ratio between the power of the function g α θ λ within a given area r and within the entire globe ω reaches a maximum 4 γ α r g α 2 θ λ d ω ω g α 2 θ λ d ω where γ α is the ratio 0 γ a 1 which indicates the energy concentration degree of each basis function g α θ λ the eigenvector g α l m and eigenvalue γ α of the square matrix of the integrals of the products between two spherical harmonic functions over r are the solutions of the above maximization problem han and razeghi 2017 simons and dahlen 2006 it should be emphasized that the coefficients g α l m and the ratio γ α are uniquely determined under the conditions of a certain region r we use the slepian alpha package harig et al 2015 to calculate the localized spherical harmonic slepian functions and consider the maximum degree of l 40 corresponding to 1681 orthogonal slepian basis functions we extend the spatial region to better capture mass changes near the border for instance we keep the buffers at 4 around the outlines of the southwest regions 0 5 along the eastern coastlines and 2 at the edges of the remaining areas fig 2 shows the concentration ratio γ α of each basis function g α θ λ the first 42 sets γ α 0 5 are mostly concentrated in china the next 17 functions are gradually outside the continent and the last 1 622 sets γ α

concentrated in mainland china see all the 59 slepian basis functions in fig s6 3 2 slepian based inversion strategy in our study we apply the slepian basis functions to examine large scale terrestrial water storage anomalies using daily gnss vertical position records first we describe the band limited the maximum degree of l surface mass loads σ l θ λ t and vertical motions u l θ λ t in the global spherical harmonic expression han and razeghi 2017 5 u l θ λ t a l 1 l m l l u lm t y lm θ λ σ l θ λ t a l 1 l m l l s lm t y lm θ λ where u lm t and s lm t are the dimensionless coefficients of the vertical displacements and mass loads which have the following linear relationship in a spectral domain 6 u lm t 3 ρ w ρ e h l 2 l 1 s lm t where ρ w and ρ e represent the density of water and the earth respectively h l denotes the vertical displacement load love numbers in a laterally homogeneous earth model when expressed by the slepian basis functions the smoothing vertical displacements and surface mass loads can be written as follows 7 u l θ λ t a α 1 l 1 2 s α vcd t g α θ λ σ l θ λ t a β 1 l 1 2 s β ewh t g β θ λ where g α θ λ and g β θ λ are the α t h and β t h slepian basis functions respectively s α vcd t and s β ewh t are the corresponding coefficients for vertical crustal displacements and ewh respectively we can linearly transform the global spherical harmonic basis functions to the slepian basis functions as follows 8 g α θ λ l 1 l m l l g α l m y lm θ λ g β θ λ l 1 l m l l g β l m y lm θ λ where g α l m and g β l m are the spherical harmonic coefficients at degree l and order m of the α t h and β t h slepian basis functions these two sets of displacement related coefficients u lm t and s α vcd t are linearly related via the eigenvectors of g α l m as follows 9 s α vcd t l 0 l m l l u lm t g α l m u lm t α 1 l 1 2 s α vcd t g α l m similarly the linear relationship is available for the load related coefficients s lm t and s β ewh t as follows 10 s β ewh t l 0 l m l l s lm t g β l m s lm t β 1 l 1 2 s β ewh t g β l m the slepian coefficients of the water loads s β ewh t can be expressed using the spherical harmonic displacement coefficients as follows 11 s β ewh t l 0 l m l l ρ e 3 ρ w 2 l 1 h l u lm t g β l m the relationship of the slepian coefficients of the water loads s β ewh t and those of the deformation s α vcd t is derived in equation 12 12 s β ewh t α 1 l 1 2 s α vcd t l 0 l m l l ρ e 3 ρ w 2 l 1 h l g α l m g β l m where s β ewh t is the slepian coefficients of mass loads in terms of ewh in our study a 300 km gaussian filter is used to suppress the high degree noise of our inversion results finally we apply an eigenvalue weighting scheme to synthesize the regional surface mass loads which dampens the contribution from high order coefficients to make the synthesis more robust han and razeghi 2017 13 σ l θ λ t a α 1 j γ α s α ewh t g α θ λ where j is the truncated number of slepian basis functions which is usually chosen according to the magnitude of eigenvalue γ α in fact this inversion problem converts discrete gnss vertical displacements to the corresponding spectral information based on the slepian basis functions and then translate to mass loads using the load love numbers e g wang et al 2012 based on a reference earth model e g the preliminary reference earth model prem dziewonski and anderson 1981 in equation 7 the slepian basis functions are truncated with the number j and the corresponding displacement coefficients are resolved by using the spatially limited gnss measurements therefore the estimated results of the slepian coefficients are largely dependent upon the number of gnss stations and their spatial distribution in our case the daily displacement coefficients of the 59 slepian basis functions fig 4 need to be estimated by using the 250 vertical displacement time series based on the least squares regression 4 results and discussion 4 1 annual changes in vertical hydrological loading motions we study gnss annual vertical displacements to characterize the seasonal variations of terrestrial water storage in mainland china which provide some key clues for understanding the terrestrial hydrological cycle the annual amplitudes of gnss vertical motions present a spatial snapshot for quantifying water storage changes in different climatic regions as illustrated in fig 5 a the multi year average seasonal vertical deformation manifests a significant spatial variation with the largest and smallest annual changes in southern and northern china respectively in particular the cmonoc network captures the most significant annual water variations in southwest china including the whole yunnan west and southwest sichuan and south and southeast tibet regions fig 5a the maximum amplitude of 13 8 mm is observed at station ynla in the southwest margin of yunnan table s2 in addition conspicuous seasonal fluctuations in water induced vertical crustal motions also occur in the middle lower yangtze river plain fig 5a with annual amplitudes of up to 9 7 mm table s2 station jxhk in northeastern china we infer notable seasonal surface mass variations in the songhua river basin where the peak vertical deformation is close to 7 1 mm table s2 station chun and is most likely caused by relatively small scale hydrological variations in the other physiographic provinces e g northwest and north china of mainland china we find subtle annual vertical displacements suggesting insignificant seasonal water storage oscillations by investigating the annual phase of the gnss vertical position time series defined as the time in day of year doy with the largest hydrological loads or maximum surface subsidence we provide some crucial insights for illuminating complex mechanisms associated with hydrological dynamics in mainland china terrestrial water storage in different regions reaches their annual maximum values in different periods ranging from late june to late september fig 5b under a typical temperate continental arid climate in northwest china the annual phase of the peak terrestrial water storage precedes that in the other regions and shows a southeastward increase from late june to early august doy 170 220 in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin the annual water storage changes peak in late july till early august doy 201 220 which is possibly associated with the meiyu rainy season fig s9 indicates that a consistent spatial feature exists in the peaks of precipitation and annual vertical displacement caused by the northward movement of the east asian summer monsoon in late spring to middle summer zhu et al 2016 the northern and northeastern regions are featured with a temperate monsoon climate in the coastal areas and a temperate continental climate in the inland regions the maximum surface subsidence accordant with the annual water loads occurs in middle august to early september in southwest china seasonal water storage attains a peak in early to later september doy 240 270 and the timing is in relation to the south asian monsoon circulation estimation of the phase for annual gnss vertical motions demonstrates the ability of gnss to detect the first order feature of terrestrial water storage variations in mainland china 4 2 gnss inferred water heights based on slepian method in our study daily gnss vertical displacements are inverted to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of terrestrial water storage variations in mainland china as shown in fig 6 a the consistency between the gnss measured vertical motions and the forward predictions at six representative stations suggests that our estimates of water storage changes are robust because the linear transformation from vertical displacement coefficients to mass loading coefficients uniquely depends on the load love numbers derived from a well defined earth model han and razeghi 2017 we compare the gnss inverted water height time series with those determined by the grace and gldas products at these stations and find good consistency in the regions with large water storage changes as shown in the time series at the station ynsm located in yunnan southwest china fig 6b the peak annual water amplitudes are 287 174 and 136 mm for gnss grace and gldas respectively we also find that significant seasonal water mass variations in the southern tibetan plateau fig 6b station xzar in addition the gnss and grace based water estimates show good agreement at the station of jxja with annual water amplitudes of 146 and 113 mm indicating notable seasonal changes in terrestrial water storage in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river however the gldas model dramatically underestimates the hydrological mass variations and gives an annual amplitude of only 41 mm the results also indicate that the gnss grace and gldas based water estimates show some discrepancies in the temporal patterns at some stations fig 6b stations xjwl hecd and hrbn the grace ewh and gldas ewh results are insufficient to detect the seasonal patterns in the regions that feature subtle annual water storage changes in contrast gnss is able to sense weak annual hydrological signals with sufficient station coverage in addition we can see that these three means consistently detect a non linear trend in the inferred water mass changes fig 6b station hrbn which may be correlated with the inter annual water storage changes in the songhua river basin of northeast china our inversion method is based on the localized spherical harmonic basis functions harig and simons 2012 simons and dahlen 2006 which uses sparsely distributed gnss data to recover large scale water mass variability han and razeghi 2017 compared to the most widely used space domain approach green s functions argus et al 2014 2017 2020 fu et al 2015 hsu et al 2020 johnson et al 2017 knappe et al 2019 milliner et al 2018 we evaluate the main factors affecting our gnss inferred water results and confirm that the first order spatiotemporal features of hydrological mass loads are reproduced by the existing gnss stations see text s4 for more details it is important to emphasize that these two methods are mathematically equivalent but are applied in different practice tests the green s function approach mainly considers fine scale loading signals corresponding to the high order spherical harmonic functions whereas the spherical harmonic method performs well in resolving the global and large scale loading changes reflected in the low order spherical harmonic coefficients shen et al 2017 of course the high order loading signals can be retrieved by using the slepian basis functions only if the spatial coverage of a gnss network is sufficient the spacing of the gnss stations in the cmonoc network ranges from 38 to 885 km with an average of 232 km which is too large for the space domain convolution approach therefore the broad scale terrestrial water storage variations across mainland china can be recovered by inverting the continuous gnss data in the sparsely instrumented cmonoc network depending on the method of spherical slepian basis functions 4 3 spatial patterns of seasonal water storage oscillations we investigate the spatial signatures of the annual water cycle in mainland china using different water height datasets including gnss grace and gldas results and compare them with the average annual precipitation over the past decade fig 7 the average annual amplitudes of water height derived from these three data sets show overall spatial consistency a strong seasonal pattern of water storage changes is discovered in southwest china including yunnan and the southern portion of the tibetan plateau which are closer to the bay of bengal and are mostly affected by the south asian monsoon jiang et al 2017a the maximum annual amplitudes are close to 314 243 and 150 mm for gnss grace and gldas inferred seasonal water oscillations respectively the pronounced seasonal water oscillations are primary due to the distinct monsoon dominated dry and wet seasons which show large amounts of rainwater in may october and very little rainfall in november april in addition numerous rivers and high vegetation coverage also promote water retention during the wet season in addition a notable change in the gnss based water storage up to166 mm occurs in the lower and middle section of the yangtze river which is consistent with the grace measured water results up to 153 mm but not shown in the gldas modeled water contents fig 7a 7b and 7c we speculate that significant seasonal variations are mainly because of southeast monsoon rainfall and many curved river systems which facilitate water storage and the inconsistency is most likely attributed to significant surface water storage changes which are unmodeled in the gldas model the annual precipitation exhibits an overall decreasing trend from the southeast to northwest regions fig 7d in general the amount of annual rainfall is more than 1000 mm in south china which is greater than 500 1000 mm in most areas of north china and 200 mm in northwest china we find abundant rainfall in yunnan and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river where large water storage oscillations are evidenced by gnss and grace ewh the southeast coast of china located in a subtropical tropical marine climate zone features abundant rainfall but relatively small annual water cycle fig 7a 7c and 7d it is likely that the most rainfall is transported to the ocean by eastward southeastward river runoff and to the atmosphere by intense evaporation these three datasets demonstrate subtle annual water storage changes in northwest china fig 7a 7c mainly attributing to very little rainfall in the arid conditions fig 7d and a poor water holding capacity in the desert steppe ecosystems water estimates derived from these three different methods generally show good spatial consistency especially in the regions with significant water storage variations some discrepancies are expected due to different spatial resolution and modeling methods the gnss measurements not only record regional water loads but also have high sensitivity to local mass changes knappe et al 2019 thus the gnss inferred water estimates have the largest annual amplitudes as compared to the grace mascon solutions and gldas hydrological product a similar conclusion is drawn in previous hydrological applications using gnss measurements argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 in contrast to the grace and gldas results the gnss inversion model also demonstrates moderate water mass changes in northwestern and northeastern china which are inferred from the relatively large annual vertical motions at the sparsely distributed gnss stations because the grace twin satellite system orbits at a high altitude of 400 km grace gives broad scale estimates of water storage variations with the native spatial resolution of 350 km argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 knappe et al 2019 as a result small scale hydrological signals in grace are difficult to be retrieved and peak annual water storage change can be underestimated in comparison with gnss estimated ewh variations fig 7a and 7b the gldas model does not include deeper groundwater and surface water components such as rivers and lakes therefore it inevitably results in an underestimation of water storage change in comparison with the grace and gnss based results fig 7 it should be emphasized that the gnss inferred water storage change based on the slepian basis functions also depends on the number of stations and their spatial distribution though the requirement is not as high as that for the space domain approach han and razeghi 2017 for example in comparison with the grace and gldas results the gnss inversion model reproduces relatively smooth and large scale water storage changes in southern tibet where there are very limited gnss stations fig 1 in the future the installation of more continuous gnss stations in the tibetan plateau is critical to improving the spatial resolution to strengthen the hydro geodetic applications 4 4 temporal features of watershed water storage variations under the influence of the wide variety of climates and complex geographies in mainland china terrestrial water storage shows complex spatiotemporal patterns in different geographic zones in our study we investigate the time variable water storage fluctuations in ten river basins located from northern to southern china fig 1 we validate our gnss inferred water height estimates against the water products from the grace satellites and the gldas model and examine the temporal correlations and the time lags between surface precipitation product and water storage changes in different basins fig 8 shows time variable water height variations spanning from january 2010 to december 2019 based on the gnss inversion modeling grace mascon solutions gldas data product and surface precipitation data in ten drainage basins the gnss inverted water changes are resampled into monthly results to allow a direct comparison with the other datasets the inland river basin in northwest china features an arid and rainless environment and shows a weak water holding capacity as shown in fig 8a gnss is able to track the seasonality of water storage changes that correlate well with monthly precipitation with a correlation coefficient of 0 81 table 1 whereas both grace and gldas only catch weaker annual hydrological signals due to the large spatial resolution for grace chen et al 2007 and unmodeled hydrological components in gldas scanlon et al 2018 differing from the inland river basin in china s hinterlands the temperate continental monsoon climate brings more rainfall in the yellow river basin fig 8b and the hai river basin fig 8c the gnss inferred temporal variations of water mass changes and the meteorological rainfall are consistent but the grace and gldas water estimates weakly correlate with the gnss based results correlation coefficients of 0 5 in table 1 it is noticed that the groundwater depletion in northern china e g the yellow and hai river basins significantly reduces the terrestrial water storage as reported in many literatures huang et al 2019 lv et al 2021 note that our study aims at examining the annual and interannual changes in water storage since the separation between long term variations of water storage and tectonic motions is difficult without other constraints in the liao river basin fig 8d and the songhua river basin fig 8e the gnss inferred ewh results show obvious interannual variations which are also observed in the gldas and grace water results this temporal evolution is consistent with the trend of annual precipitation which shows that the amount of rainfall in the pluvial periods 2012 2014 clearly exceeds the multi annual average the huai river basin is located in the climate transition zone between northern and southern china fig 8f the amount of annual rainfall significantly increases towards the south compared to the above mentioned basins and a correlation of 0 64 can be found between the rainfall and gnss inferred water storage changes table 1 the southeast river basin fig 8g and the pearl river basin fig 8i have the most abundant rainfall during the rainy season from may to october due to the meiyu period in mid june to mid july and typhoons in august september day et al 2018 the yangtze river is the longest river in china with numerous tributaries the seasonal water oscillations indicate strong consistency between gnss grace and gldas ewh fig 8h with a correlation coefficient of 0 80 the amplitudes of annual water height are 98 37 and 28 mm for these three data sets as shown in fig 8j the southwest river basin is characterized by well defined dry and wet seasons mainly dominated by the south asian monsoon the hydrologic system of the southwest river basin shows the most distinct seasonality with the annual amplitudes of 185 74 and 52 mm for gnss grace and gldas ewh as demonstrated in fig 8 we find that gnss succeeds in characterizing the seasonality of watershed scale water storage variations and shows good agreement with the monthly precipitation with correlation coefficients from 0 52 to 0 81 on the contrary grace and gldas are unable to track the seasonal water patterns in small watersheds with low water storage changes fig 8b 8f this discrepancy may be attributed to high sensitivity for gnss to detect both regional and local hydrologic mass transfer knappe et al 2019 in the regions with notable water storage changes we find a good temporal correlation 0 56 0 93 between gnss grace and gldas measured results fig 8g 8j in southern china the peak water storage generally lags 1 2 months behind the largest precipitation which is a common feature in most tropical and subtropical regions such as the amazon basin central africa and australia humphrey et al 2016 and is related to complex dynamic processes involved in water storage and transport hsu et al 2020 in summary our inversion results demonstrate that the sparsely located continuous gnss network e g the cmonoc is a complementary tool to monitor the watershed scale surface mass redistribution 4 5 the ability of gnss to track extreme hydrological events the gnss ewh integrates total terrestrial water storage rather than individual water components which can independently characterize hydrological extremes without additional constraints inspired by the grace based drought severity index grace dsi zhao et al 2017a 2017b we demonstrate the ability of gnss to track drought and pluvial extremes in our study we define the gnss dsi as the standardized anomalies of gnss ewh estimates which are calculated by subtracting the climatology from the monthly gnss ewh time series and then dividing by the climatological standard deviations see more details in text s5 note that a monthly climatology consists of an average value for each month e g the mean value of all januaries in 2010 2019 and anomalies or deviations are created by subtracting climatological values from observations the gnss dsi categories are shown in table 2 and are consistent with that of grace dsi zhao et al 2017a we then determine the onset end duration and severity for an extreme hydrological period defined as a water deficit surplus lasting for three or more consecutive months thomas et al 2014 fig 9 shows the gnss dsi time series in comparison with monthly precipitation deviations from climatological precipitation in 2010 2019 monsoon anomalies and complex topographies result in that water rich yunnan become a drought flood hotspot jiang et al 2017a our results indicate that yunnan frequently suffers seasonal droughts in 2010 2019 fig 9a the most serious drought began in march 2019 and lasted for 10 months with the highest severity of 2 24 in july table 3 which is classified as an exceptional drought table 3 this event is also documented as a record breaking drought due to long lasting rainfall deficits ding and gao 2020 the summer drought in 2011 had the largest rainfall shortage in july august but the gnss dsi obviously lags and reaches the most serious state in january 2012 the lowest dsi of 1 71 in addition other d0 d2 drought events occurred in yunnan show various durations ranging from 3 to7 months there are nine wet events that are identified by our gnss dsi results table 3 the 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 water surplus events in yunnan lasted for 17 and 11 months respectively our results indicate that the midstream and downstream areas of the yangtze river are also vulnerable to hydrological disasters fig 9b in 2015 2016 an exceptionally wet period w4 occurred in may 2015 to july 2016 with a maximum severity of 2 08 in december 2015 this extreme is closely linked to a strong el niño ma et al 2018 and manifests prolonged periods of torrential rain and caused flood disaster in the middle lower yangtze plains due to the low terrain curved streamway and excessive deforestation another extremely wet w3 incident occurred from march 2012 to january 2013 and had the highest severity of 1 63 in may 2012 we observe three extreme droughts d3 lasting for 15 2010 12 2012 02 17 2013 02 2014 06 and 10 2018 03 2018 12 months and showing the lowest dsi values of 1 62 in april 2011 1 93 in january 2014 and 1 86 in june 2018 table 3 other abnormal to severe d0 d2 drought events are listed in table 3 the timing of water deficit events d2 d4 defined by gnss dsi is temporally correlated with the grace identified results ran et al 2021 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020 both songhua and liao refer to songliao river basins are characterized by a temperate semi humid and semi arid monsoon climate and are subjected to alternating droughts and floods chen et al 2018 our gnss results indicate strong interannual variability fig 8d and 8e and five dry and three wet episodes in the songliao river basins table 3 and fig 9c a moderate drought lasted for 13 months in 2011 2012 and was followed a long term wet period with durations of 26 months 2012 04 2014 05 with the highest severity of 2 13 w4 the most lasting arid period occurred from june 2015 to may 2018 with the lowest dsi of 1 62 catalogued as an extreme drought d3 another moderately wet w1 event lasting for 19 months 2018 06 2019 12 had a maximum severity of 1 19 in february 2019 our results suggest that the continuously operating gnss network even with sparse spatial coverage can serve as a complementary tool to identify and quantify hydrological extremes the gnss dsi standardizes drought and flood induced total water deviations from climatological normal and can be applied to operational hydrological monitoring therefore using the gnss dsi together with the traditional hydrological monitoring tools will improve the predictions and management of hydrological extremes 5 conclusion we use gnss vertical crustal displacements in a sparse gnss array with the average station spacing of 232 km to investigate the continental water storage changes and compare with water products from the grace gldas models and precipitation data in mainland china we find considerable variations of annual water storage in southwestern china with the largest annual amplitude of 314 mm in the gnss inferred water estimates in comparison with 243 mm from the grace mascon solutions and 150 mm from the gldas model moreover a notable change of gnss inferred water storage occurs in the middle and lower section of the yangtze river which is in line with the grace measured results through analyzing the time varying water storage fluctuations we find that gnss succeeds in characterizing the seasonality of watershed scale water storage changes and shows good agreement with the temporal variations of monthly precipitation the gnss grace and gldas based water estimates show coherent temporal patterns in south china where terrestrial water displays large seasonality but weak correlations are found in north china due to subtle annual water changes we also suggest that gnss dsi is able to track drought and pluvial periods and to independently characterize hydrological extremes without additional constraints our inversion result demonstrates that a sparsely distributed gnss array such as the cmonoc network is sufficient to monitor the large scale surface mass redistribution credit

4564,surface displacements measured by the global navigation satellite system gnss integrate the elastic response of the solid earth to regional and local hydrologic loading signals and provide an opportunity for near real time monitoring of terrestrial water storage variations here we estimate the spectral information of hydrology induced vertical surface deformation based on spherical slepian basis functions and recover the daily changes in continental water storage over mainland china from january 2010 to december 2019 our inversion results depending on a sparsely distributed gnss network indicate the largest seasonal fluctuation of hydrological mass loads in southwestern china the gnss inferred equivalent water height has an annual amplitude of up to 314 mm which is greater than 243 mm from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and 150 mm from the global land data assimilation system gldas we also find notable seasonal water oscillations of 153 166 mm in the middle and lower yangtze river basin this feature appears in the gnss inversion model and grace mascon solutions but is invisible in the gldas model mostly indicating the existence of significant changes in surface water storage that is unmodeled in the gldas model there is board agreement in the water estimates derived from multiple data sets in south china in contrast to weak temporal coherence of various water estimates in north china we also demonstrate the ability of gnss for tracking the drought and wet periods which can serve as an independent means to characterize hydrological extremes our study emphasizes that a sparse gnss network can still be considered as a complementary tool to map large scale spatiotemporal variations of water storage and benefit the hydrological community for assessing water storage changes and hydrological dynamics keywords gnss slepian basis functions terrestrial water storage seasonal water oscillations hydrological dynamics 1 introduction resolving the geographical and temporal patterns of terrestrial water provide critical insights for studying hydrological dynamics climatic variations and water resources management improvements in the hydrological modeling and observation technology allow us to precisely measure and continuously monitor the redistribution of earth s water at different temporal and spatial scales hydrological models as a representation of terrestrial hydrologic processes in mathematical models are widely applied to address climate variations and human stresses on global water resources hydrological models generally simplify complex hydrological processes based on a limited representation of the water energy cycle thereby they are usually unable to capture the complete hydrological components and easily underestimate climate and human induced water storage changes scanlon et al 2018 for example the noah land surface model in the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 only contains soil moisture of 0 2 m depth snow water equivalent and total canopy water storage and ignores the influence of surface water lakes rivers and reservoir deep groundwater and anthropogenic components space based advanced gravimetric measurement techniques for instance the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace provide integrated information on total water storage rather than individual hydrological components the grace and grace fo dual satellite missions provide a revolutionary tool for precisely measuring the earth s geopotential field and for continuously tracking global mass changes harig and simons 2012 tapley et al 2019 nevertheless grace has coarse temporal monthly sampling and spatial resolution approximately 350 km trautmann et al 2018 and is insensitive to high frequency and fine scale terrestrial water storage variations enzminger et al 2018 knappe et al 2019 ground based gnss instruments can accurately measure subtle deformation of earth s surface with millimeter level precision and have been successfully applied in tracking the water mass changes at different spatiotemporal scales argus et al 2014 2017 borsa et al 2014 enzminger et al 2018 fu et al 2015 heki 2001 jin and zhang 2016 johnson et al 2017 knappe et al 2019 milliner et al 2018 the continuously operating gnss networks provide an additional means to measure the water induced surface elastic deformation such as short duration changes associated with storms geng et al 2012 milliner et al 2018 and long term variability related to climate changes argus et al 2014 2017 fu et al 2015 in a densely instrumented region gnss measurements could resolve fine scale spatial variations in terrestrial water storage argus et al 2014 2017 fu et al 2015 hsu et al 2020 allowing for capturing local hydrologic changes at watershed scales of tens of kilometers to regional loading changes with distances up to 300 km knappe et al 2019 more importantly a dense gnss array presents a new tool for near real time monitoring of surface motions associated with meteorological extremes characterized by significant water mass fluctuations with ultra low latency 1 day which leads to grand potential in operational hydrological monitoring and facilitates the early warning systems for disasters associated with hydrometeorological extremes such as storm surges geng et al 2012 milliner et al 2018 and droughts chew and small 2014 most published gnss inferred water mass variations as mentioned in the previous paragraph are based on the spatial domain convolution approach namely green s function method when the spatial coverage of gnss networks is insufficient the green s function approach argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 jin and zhang 2016 is not an ideal way for the investigation of terrestrial hydrological mass variations han and razeghi 2017 introduced a new methodology based on the localized spherical harmonic basis functions generally called spherical slepian basis functions slepian 1983 to recover continental not global hydrological mass variations with the spatial resolution in line with the grace satellite mission the slepian functions are considered as an optimal alternative to traditional spherical harmonics to deal with geophysical signals over spatially limited regions which are introduced to improve the precision and accuracy of a nonglobal modeling application with a limited observational bandwidth harig et al 2015 based on the localized spherical harmonic functions widespread geoscientific applications associated with gravity variations are developed such as ice mass loss in greenland harig and simons 2012 antarctica gao et al 2019 harig and simons 2015 arctic harig and simons 2016 and iceland von hippel and harig 2019 postseismic gravity changes following great earthquakes han et al 2008 regional lunar gravity modeling han 2008 and hydrologic and atmospheric mass variations at the continental scale han and razeghi 2017 in this study we aim at investigating the terrestrial water storage anomalies at the continental scale using the continuous measurements in a sparse gnss network our inversion modeling relies on the localized spherical harmonic slepian basis functions and recovers daily hydrologic mass variations using vertical surface displacements based on the time varying inversion scheme we examine the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of continental water storage changes in mainland china and validate our gnss inverted water estimates against grace gldas and precipitation products we investigate the correlation coefficients and phase lags between meteorological precipitation and water storage changes in ten drainage basins located in mainland china we also use the gnss based water estimates to characterize the hydrological extremes e g droughts and floods this study not only illustrates the spatiotemporal patterns of terrestrial water storage changes but also provides evidence for practical applications of the detection of extreme climate events in mainland china 2 materials 2 1 study area china fig 1 is situated in east asia adjacent to the western pacific ocean and is characterized by multifarious geographic features in topography landscape and climate the topography in china features a three step staircase with an eastward descending trend and diversified landscapes consisting of plateaus plains basins foothills and mountains owing to the special geographical locations and complicated topographical conditions the climate is diverse including temperate subtropical and tropical monsoon climate from northern to southern portions of eastern china temperate continental climate in northeast china and plateau mountain climate in the tibetan plateau annual precipitation attains the largest in southeast china more than 2000 mm and gradually decreases toward the northwest below 200 mm water resources are unevenly distributed in different regions for example northwest china centrally located in the eurasian continent is facing serious water shortage whereas south china has abundant water resources due to rich monsoonal rainfall and dense river systems in addition an increase in anthropogenic activities e g water withdrawals in north china and dam projects in southwest china and the middle lower yangtze river may break original hydrological cycles and lead to the growth of hydrological disasters therefore investigating spatiotemporal evolutions of terrestrial water storage variations is critical for our understanding of the hydrological cycle and is conducive to water resource management in mainland china 2 2 data and preprocessing 2 2 1 gnss vertical time series we collect the gnss position time series in 2010 2019 from the crustal movement observation network of china cmonoc the gnss data are accessible in the china earthquake data center cedc http www eqdsc com established by the first monitoring and application center china earthquake administration cea the gnss measurements are processed with the gamit globk version 10 4 package herring et al 2018 and the detailed data processing procedures are summarized in text s1 to image the daily terrestrial water storage changes over mainland china the daily position solutions at 250 stations fig 1 and table s2 are carefully selected and reprocessed for studying the hydrological loading deformation in our study see more details in text s2 the geophysical fluid loading products which are released by the earth system modeling group at deutsches geoforschungszentrum esmgfz http esmdata gfz potsdam de 8080 repository are utilized to remove the non tidal oceanic and atmospheric loading displacements in the center of figure cf frame of the solid earth surface the annual amplitudes of atmospheric loads range from 1 3 to 6 6 mm in the gnss vertical position time series fig s1 the earth s surface periodically deforms under the non tidal oceanic loads with the annual amplitudes of about 1 0 2 5 mm along the coastal regions in contrast to that of 0 5 mm in the inland regions fig s2 the postglacial rebound effect causes crustal uplift of 0 3 to 0 6 mm yr across china fig s3 and is corrected by using the ice 6g d model purcell et al 2016 we then fit each vertical time series with a position a linear velocity annual and semiannual motions instrument and coseismic offsets and postseismic relaxation terms jiang et al 2017b including the 2011 tohoku oki earthquake and the 2015 gorkha earthquake note that the postseismic relaxation characterized by a logarithmic function is only applied to stations which show visible coseismic displacements to implement an inversion model for water storage variations we remove the long term linear trend offsets and postseismic deformation from the raw time series to study crustal motions associated with water cycles since we rely on the continuous time series with an identical sampling rate for our time variant inversion missing data are filled by using the gnss missing data interpolation software gmis liu et al 2018 this dynamic spatiotemporal interpolation method applies the kriged kalman filter and has an excellent performance in handling continuous and random data gaps based on the network coordinate time series we implement the spatiotemporal interpolation method see more details in text s3 and obtain the filtered time series with data gaps filled shown in fig s5 for an example 2 2 2 grace mascon solutions the new mascon solutions based on grace rl06 downloaded from the center for space research csr http www2 csr utexas edu grace are considered to validate our inversion results of equivalent water height ewh changes we use the csr grace rl06 mascon solutions defined at 0 25 rectangle grids covering the time span from january 2010 to june 2017 the deadline of the available data including 17 months with missing data all well characterized corrections including the c20 estimates from satellite laser ranging slr degree 1 coefficients atmospheric and oceanic effects and glacial isostatic adjustment gia components have been applied to the newly released grace mascon products save 2019 save et al 2016 when using the water products from the csr mascon solutions we do not need to use additional smoothing empirical de striping filtering or scaling factors to compare with gnss and gldas based water height time series the missing grace data are filled by the spline interpolation method which gives the interpolated values based on a cubic interpolation of the values at neighboring points 2 2 3 gldas data product we consider the monthly products from the gldas 2 1 noah land surface model from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center ges disc https disc gsfc nasa gov to investigate the spatiotemporal distributions of near surface water storage changes the hydrological products are sampled at 0 25 0 25 spatial grids extending from 180 0 w to180 0 e and 60 0 n to 90 0 s we calculate the total water contents by summing soil moistures at depths of 0 to 2 m snow water equivalent and total canopy water storage we use the gramat code to examine the temporal features of regional water storage changes which applies an area weighted scheme to convert time dependent grided data within a boundary of interest to the water storage time series feng 2019 2 2 4 surface precipitation product to probe the relationship between precipitation and terrestrial water mass changes we collect the monthly precipitation products from the china meteorological data service center of the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn this dataset integrates the measurements from 2472 surface meteorological stations in mainland china the released precipitation products are made into 0 5 0 5 grids extending from longitudes 72 e to 136 e and latitudes 18 n to 54 n based on the spatial interpolation method of thin plate spline which finds a minimally bended smooth surface that passes through all given points 3 methodology 3 1 slepian basis functions based on the harmonic spectral analysis theory any time variant truncated geophysical signals f l θ λ t of degree l can be written in the global spherical harmonic expression as follows 1 f l θ λ t a l 1 l m l l f lm t y lm θ λ where y lm θ λ is the spherical harmonic functions at geographical coordinates colatitude θ longitude λ f lm t represents the harmonic coefficient at degree l and order m a denotes the radius of the earth when implementing a regional non global model slepian basis functions should be an alternative to traditional spherical harmonic functions which are only practical for global modeling detailed discussions associated with slepian functions are presented in previous studies harig and simons 2012 simons and dahlen 2006 simons et al 2006 we can write the truncated signal with the bandwidth l in slepian basis functions as follows 2 f l θ λ t a α 1 l 1 2 s α t g α θ λ where g α θ λ is the α th slepian basis function s α t is the corresponding coefficient the linchpin is to make a linear transformation from y lm θ λ to g α θ λ which should be exact as follows 3 g α θ λ l 0 l m l l g α l m y lm θ λ where g α l m is the l th degree m th order spherical harmonic coefficient of the α th slepian function to a given l it comprises l 1 2 group orthogonal basis functions the optimal one is obtained when the ratio between the power of the function g α θ λ within a given area r and within the entire globe ω reaches a maximum 4 γ α r g α 2 θ λ d ω ω g α 2 θ λ d ω where γ α is the ratio 0 γ a 1 which indicates the energy concentration degree of each basis function g α θ λ the eigenvector g α l m and eigenvalue γ α of the square matrix of the integrals of the products between two spherical harmonic functions over r are the solutions of the above maximization problem han and razeghi 2017 simons and dahlen 2006 it should be emphasized that the coefficients g α l m and the ratio γ α are uniquely determined under the conditions of a certain region r we use the slepian alpha package harig et al 2015 to calculate the localized spherical harmonic slepian functions and consider the maximum degree of l 40 corresponding to 1681 orthogonal slepian basis functions we extend the spatial region to better capture mass changes near the border for instance we keep the buffers at 4 around the outlines of the southwest regions 0 5 along the eastern coastlines and 2 at the edges of the remaining areas fig 2 shows the concentration ratio γ α of each basis function g α θ λ the first 42 sets γ α 0 5 are mostly concentrated in china the next 17 functions are gradually outside the continent and the last 1 622 sets γ α 0 1 are mainly located outside the mainland the first 59 slepian basis functions γ α 0 1 are enough to represent the source signal fields in mainland china fig 3 shows the first 26 sets γ α 0 9 well concentrated in mainland china see all the 59 slepian basis functions in fig s6 3 2 slepian based inversion strategy in our study we apply the slepian basis functions to examine large scale terrestrial water storage anomalies using daily gnss vertical position records first we describe the band limited the maximum degree of l surface mass loads σ l θ λ t and vertical motions u l θ λ t in the global spherical harmonic expression han and razeghi 2017 5 u l θ λ t a l 1 l m l l u lm t y lm θ λ σ l θ λ t a l 1 l m l l s lm t y lm θ λ where u lm t and s lm t are the dimensionless coefficients of the vertical displacements and mass loads which have the following linear relationship in a spectral domain 6 u lm t 3 ρ w ρ e h l 2 l 1 s lm t where ρ w and ρ e represent the density of water and the earth respectively h l denotes the vertical displacement load love numbers in a laterally homogeneous earth model when expressed by the slepian basis functions the smoothing vertical displacements and surface mass loads can be written as follows 7 u l θ λ t a α 1 l 1 2 s α vcd t g α θ λ σ l θ λ t a β 1 l 1 2 s β ewh t g β θ λ where g α θ λ and g β θ λ are the α t h and β t h slepian basis functions respectively s α vcd t and s β ewh t are the corresponding coefficients for vertical crustal displacements and ewh respectively we can linearly transform the global spherical harmonic basis functions to the slepian basis functions as follows 8 g α θ λ l 1 l m l l g α l m y lm θ λ g β θ λ l 1 l m l l g β l m y lm θ λ where g α l m and g β l m are the spherical harmonic coefficients at degree l and order m of the α t h and β t h slepian basis functions these two sets of displacement related coefficients u lm t and s α vcd t are linearly related via the eigenvectors of g α l m as follows 9 s α vcd t l 0 l m l l u lm t g α l m u lm t α 1 l 1 2 s α vcd t g α l m similarly the linear relationship is available for the load related coefficients s lm t and s β ewh t as follows 10 s β ewh t l 0 l m l l s lm t g β l m s lm t β 1 l 1 2 s β ewh t g β l m the slepian coefficients of the water loads s β ewh t can be expressed using the spherical harmonic displacement coefficients as follows 11 s β ewh t l 0 l m l l ρ e 3 ρ w 2 l 1 h l u lm t g β l m the relationship of the slepian coefficients of the water loads s β ewh t and those of the deformation s α vcd t is derived in equation 12 12 s β ewh t α 1 l 1 2 s α vcd t l 0 l m l l ρ e 3 ρ w 2 l 1 h l g α l m g β l m where s β ewh t is the slepian coefficients of mass loads in terms of ewh in our study a 300 km gaussian filter is used to suppress the high degree noise of our inversion results finally we apply an eigenvalue weighting scheme to synthesize the regional surface mass loads which dampens the contribution from high order coefficients to make the synthesis more robust han and razeghi 2017 13 σ l θ λ t a α 1 j γ α s α ewh t g α θ λ where j is the truncated number of slepian basis functions which is usually chosen according to the magnitude of eigenvalue γ α in fact this inversion problem converts discrete gnss vertical displacements to the corresponding spectral information based on the slepian basis functions and then translate to mass loads using the load love numbers e g wang et al 2012 based on a reference earth model e g the preliminary reference earth model prem dziewonski and anderson 1981 in equation 7 the slepian basis functions are truncated with the number j and the corresponding displacement coefficients are resolved by using the spatially limited gnss measurements therefore the estimated results of the slepian coefficients are largely dependent upon the number of gnss stations and their spatial distribution in our case the daily displacement coefficients of the 59 slepian basis functions fig 4 need to be estimated by using the 250 vertical displacement time series based on the least squares regression 4 results and discussion 4 1 annual changes in vertical hydrological loading motions we study gnss annual vertical displacements to characterize the seasonal variations of terrestrial water storage in mainland china which provide some key clues for understanding the terrestrial hydrological cycle the annual amplitudes of gnss vertical motions present a spatial snapshot for quantifying water storage changes in different climatic regions as illustrated in fig 5 a the multi year average seasonal vertical deformation manifests a significant spatial variation with the largest and smallest annual changes in southern and northern china respectively in particular the cmonoc network captures the most significant annual water variations in southwest china including the whole yunnan west and southwest sichuan and south and southeast tibet regions fig 5a the maximum amplitude of 13 8 mm is observed at station ynla in the southwest margin of yunnan table s2 in addition conspicuous seasonal fluctuations in water induced vertical crustal motions also occur in the middle lower yangtze river plain fig 5a with annual amplitudes of up to 9 7 mm table s2 station jxhk in northeastern china we infer notable seasonal surface mass variations in the songhua river basin where the peak vertical deformation is close to 7 1 mm table s2 station chun and is most likely caused by relatively small scale hydrological variations in the other physiographic provinces e g northwest and north china of mainland china we find subtle annual vertical displacements suggesting insignificant seasonal water storage oscillations by investigating the annual phase of the gnss vertical position time series defined as the time in day of year doy with the largest hydrological loads or maximum surface subsidence we provide some crucial insights for illuminating complex mechanisms associated with hydrological dynamics in mainland china terrestrial water storage in different regions reaches their annual maximum values in different periods ranging from late june to late september fig 5b under a typical temperate continental arid climate in northwest china the annual phase of the peak terrestrial water storage precedes that in the other regions and shows a southeastward increase from late june to early august doy 170 220 in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin the annual water storage changes peak in late july till early august doy 201 220 which is possibly associated with the meiyu rainy season fig s9 indicates that a consistent spatial feature exists in the peaks of precipitation and annual vertical displacement caused by the northward movement of the east asian summer monsoon in late spring to middle summer zhu et al 2016 the northern and northeastern regions are featured with a temperate monsoon climate in the coastal areas and a temperate continental climate in the inland regions the maximum surface subsidence accordant with the annual water loads occurs in middle august to early september in southwest china seasonal water storage attains a peak in early to later september doy 240 270 and the timing is in relation to the south asian monsoon circulation estimation of the phase for annual gnss vertical motions demonstrates the ability of gnss to detect the first order feature of terrestrial water storage variations in mainland china 4 2 gnss inferred water heights based on slepian method in our study daily gnss vertical displacements are inverted to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of terrestrial water storage variations in mainland china as shown in fig 6 a the consistency between the gnss measured vertical motions and the forward predictions at six representative stations suggests that our estimates of water storage changes are robust because the linear transformation from vertical displacement coefficients to mass loading coefficients uniquely depends on the load love numbers derived from a well defined earth model han and razeghi 2017 we compare the gnss inverted water height time series with those determined by the grace and gldas products at these stations and find good consistency in the regions with large water storage changes as shown in the time series at the station ynsm located in yunnan southwest china fig 6b the peak annual water amplitudes are 287 174 and 136 mm for gnss grace and gldas respectively we also find that significant seasonal water mass variations in the southern tibetan plateau fig 6b station xzar in addition the gnss and grace based water estimates show good agreement at the station of jxja with annual water amplitudes of 146 and 113 mm indicating notable seasonal changes in terrestrial water storage in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river however the gldas model dramatically underestimates the hydrological mass variations and gives an annual amplitude of only 41 mm the results also indicate that the gnss grace and gldas based water estimates show some discrepancies in the temporal patterns at some stations fig 6b stations xjwl hecd and hrbn the grace ewh and gldas ewh results are insufficient to detect the seasonal patterns in the regions that feature subtle annual water storage changes in contrast gnss is able to sense weak annual hydrological signals with sufficient station coverage in addition we can see that these three means consistently detect a non linear trend in the inferred water mass changes fig 6b station hrbn which may be correlated with the inter annual water storage changes in the songhua river basin of northeast china our inversion method is based on the localized spherical harmonic basis functions harig and simons 2012 simons and dahlen 2006 which uses sparsely distributed gnss data to recover large scale water mass variability han and razeghi 2017 compared to the most widely used space domain approach green s functions argus et al 2014 2017 2020 fu et al 2015 hsu et al 2020 johnson et al 2017 knappe et al 2019 milliner et al 2018 we evaluate the main factors affecting our gnss inferred water results and confirm that the first order spatiotemporal features of hydrological mass loads are reproduced by the existing gnss stations see text s4 for more details it is important to emphasize that these two methods are mathematically equivalent but are applied in different practice tests the green s function approach mainly considers fine scale loading signals corresponding to the high order spherical harmonic functions whereas the spherical harmonic method performs well in resolving the global and large scale loading changes reflected in the low order spherical harmonic coefficients shen et al 2017 of course the high order loading signals can be retrieved by using the slepian basis functions only if the spatial coverage of a gnss network is sufficient the spacing of the gnss stations in the cmonoc network ranges from 38 to 885 km with an average of 232 km which is too large for the space domain convolution approach therefore the broad scale terrestrial water storage variations across mainland china can be recovered by inverting the continuous gnss data in the sparsely instrumented cmonoc network depending on the method of spherical slepian basis functions 4 3 spatial patterns of seasonal water storage oscillations we investigate the spatial signatures of the annual water cycle in mainland china using different water height datasets including gnss grace and gldas results and compare them with the average annual precipitation over the past decade fig 7 the average annual amplitudes of water height derived from these three data sets show overall spatial consistency a strong seasonal pattern of water storage changes is discovered in southwest china including yunnan and the southern portion of the tibetan plateau which are closer to the bay of bengal and are mostly affected by the south asian monsoon jiang et al 2017a the maximum annual amplitudes are close to 314 243 and 150 mm for gnss grace and gldas inferred seasonal water oscillations respectively the pronounced seasonal water oscillations are primary due to the distinct monsoon dominated dry and wet seasons which show large amounts of rainwater in may october and very little rainfall in november april in addition numerous rivers and high vegetation coverage also promote water retention during the wet season in addition a notable change in the gnss based water storage up to166 mm occurs in the lower and middle section of the yangtze river which is consistent with the grace measured water results up to 153 mm but not shown in the gldas modeled water contents fig 7a 7b and 7c we speculate that significant seasonal variations are mainly because of southeast monsoon rainfall and many curved river systems which facilitate water storage and the inconsistency is most likely attributed to significant surface water storage changes which are unmodeled in the gldas model the annual precipitation exhibits an overall decreasing trend from the southeast to northwest regions fig 7d in general the amount of annual rainfall is more than 1000 mm in south china which is greater than 500 1000 mm in most areas of north china and 200 mm in northwest china we find abundant rainfall in yunnan and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river where large water storage oscillations are evidenced by gnss and grace ewh the southeast coast of china located in a subtropical tropical marine climate zone features abundant rainfall but relatively small annual water cycle fig 7a 7c and 7d it is likely that the most rainfall is transported to the ocean by eastward southeastward river runoff and to the atmosphere by intense evaporation these three datasets demonstrate subtle annual water storage changes in northwest china fig 7a 7c mainly attributing to very little rainfall in the arid conditions fig 7d and a poor water holding capacity in the desert steppe ecosystems water estimates derived from these three different methods generally show good spatial consistency especially in the regions with significant water storage variations some discrepancies are expected due to different spatial resolution and modeling methods the gnss measurements not only record regional water loads but also have high sensitivity to local mass changes knappe et al 2019 thus the gnss inferred water estimates have the largest annual amplitudes as compared to the grace mascon solutions and gldas hydrological product a similar conclusion is drawn in previous hydrological applications using gnss measurements argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 in contrast to the grace and gldas results the gnss inversion model also demonstrates moderate water mass changes in northwestern and northeastern china which are inferred from the relatively large annual vertical motions at the sparsely distributed gnss stations because the grace twin satellite system orbits at a high altitude of 400 km grace gives broad scale estimates of water storage variations with the native spatial resolution of 350 km argus et al 2014 fu et al 2015 knappe et al 2019 as a result small scale hydrological signals in grace are difficult to be retrieved and peak annual water storage change can be underestimated in comparison with gnss estimated ewh variations fig 7a and 7b the gldas model does not include deeper groundwater and surface water components such as rivers and lakes therefore it inevitably results in an underestimation of water storage change in comparison with the grace and gnss based results fig 7 it should be emphasized that the gnss inferred water storage change based on the slepian basis functions also depends on the number of stations and their spatial distribution though the requirement is not as high as that for the space domain approach han and razeghi 2017 for example in comparison with the grace and gldas results the gnss inversion model reproduces relatively smooth and large scale water storage changes in southern tibet where there are very limited gnss stations fig 1 in the future the installation of more continuous gnss stations in the tibetan plateau is critical to improving the spatial resolution to strengthen the hydro geodetic applications 4 4 temporal features of watershed water storage variations under the influence of the wide variety of climates and complex geographies in mainland china terrestrial water storage shows complex spatiotemporal patterns in different geographic zones in our study we investigate the time variable water storage fluctuations in ten river basins located from northern to southern china fig 1 we validate our gnss inferred water height estimates against the water products from the grace satellites and the gldas model and examine the temporal correlations and the time lags between surface precipitation product and water storage changes in different basins fig 8 shows time variable water height variations spanning from january 2010 to december 2019 based on the gnss inversion modeling grace mascon solutions gldas data product and surface precipitation data in ten drainage basins the gnss inverted water changes are resampled into monthly results to allow a direct comparison with the other datasets the inland river basin in northwest china features an arid and rainless environment and shows a weak water holding capacity as shown in fig 8a gnss is able to track the seasonality of water storage changes that correlate well with monthly precipitation with a correlation coefficient of 0 81 table 1 whereas both grace and gldas only catch weaker annual hydrological signals due to the large spatial resolution for grace chen et al 2007 and unmodeled hydrological components in gldas scanlon et al 2018 differing from the inland river basin in china s hinterlands the temperate continental monsoon climate brings more rainfall in the yellow river basin fig 8b and the hai river basin fig 8c the gnss inferred temporal variations of water mass changes and the meteorological rainfall are consistent but the grace and gldas water estimates weakly correlate with the gnss based results correlation coefficients of 0 5 in table 1 it is noticed that the groundwater depletion in northern china e g the yellow and hai river basins significantly reduces the terrestrial water storage as reported in many literatures huang et al 2019 lv et al 2021 note that our study aims at examining the annual and interannual changes in water storage since the separation between long term variations of water storage and tectonic motions is difficult without other constraints in the liao river basin fig 8d and the songhua river basin fig 8e the gnss inferred ewh results show obvious interannual variations which are also observed in the gldas and grace water results this temporal evolution is consistent with the trend of annual precipitation which shows that the amount of rainfall in the pluvial periods 2012 2014 clearly exceeds the multi annual average the huai river basin is located in the climate transition zone between northern and southern china fig 8f the amount of annual rainfall significantly increases towards the south compared to the above mentioned basins and a correlation of 0 64 can be found between the rainfall and gnss inferred water storage changes table 1 the southeast river basin fig 8g and the pearl river basin fig 8i have the most abundant rainfall during the rainy season from may to october due to the meiyu period in mid june to mid july and typhoons in august september day et al 2018 the yangtze river is the longest river in china with numerous tributaries the seasonal water oscillations indicate strong consistency between gnss grace and gldas ewh fig 8h with a correlation coefficient of 0 80 the amplitudes of annual water height are 98 37 and 28 mm for these three data sets as shown in fig 8j the southwest river basin is characterized by well defined dry and wet seasons mainly dominated by the south asian monsoon the hydrologic system of the southwest river basin shows the most distinct seasonality with the annual amplitudes of 185 74 and 52 mm for gnss grace and gldas ewh as demonstrated in fig 8 we find that gnss succeeds in characterizing the seasonality of watershed scale water storage variations and shows good agreement with the monthly precipitation with correlation coefficients from 0 52 to 0 81 on the contrary grace and gldas are unable to track the seasonal water patterns in small watersheds with low water storage changes fig 8b 8f this discrepancy may be attributed to high sensitivity for gnss to detect both regional and local hydrologic mass transfer knappe et al 2019 in the regions with notable water storage changes we find a good temporal correlation 0 56 0 93 between gnss grace and gldas measured results fig 8g 8j in southern china the peak water storage generally lags 1 2 months behind the largest precipitation which is a common feature in most tropical and subtropical regions such as the amazon basin central africa and australia humphrey et al 2016 and is related to complex dynamic processes involved in water storage and transport hsu et al 2020 in summary our inversion results demonstrate that the sparsely located continuous gnss network e g the cmonoc is a complementary tool to monitor the watershed scale surface mass redistribution 4 5 the ability of gnss to track extreme hydrological events the gnss ewh integrates total terrestrial water storage rather than individual water components which can independently characterize hydrological extremes without additional constraints inspired by the grace based drought severity index grace dsi zhao et al 2017a 2017b we demonstrate the ability of gnss to track drought and pluvial extremes in our study we define the gnss dsi as the standardized anomalies of gnss ewh estimates which are calculated by subtracting the climatology from the monthly gnss ewh time series and then dividing by the climatological standard deviations see more details in text s5 note that a monthly climatology consists of an average value for each month e g the mean value of all januaries in 2010 2019 and anomalies or deviations are created by subtracting climatological values from observations the gnss dsi categories are shown in table 2 and are consistent with that of grace dsi zhao et al 2017a we then determine the onset end duration and severity for an extreme hydrological period defined as a water deficit surplus lasting for three or more consecutive months thomas et al 2014 fig 9 shows the gnss dsi time series in comparison with monthly precipitation deviations from climatological precipitation in 2010 2019 monsoon anomalies and complex topographies result in that water rich yunnan become a drought flood hotspot jiang et al 2017a our results indicate that yunnan frequently suffers seasonal droughts in 2010 2019 fig 9a the most serious drought began in march 2019 and lasted for 10 months with the highest severity of 2 24 in july table 3 which is classified as an exceptional drought table 3 this event is also documented as a record breaking drought due to long lasting rainfall deficits ding and gao 2020 the summer drought in 2011 had the largest rainfall shortage in july august but the gnss dsi obviously lags and reaches the most serious state in january 2012 the lowest dsi of 1 71 in addition other d0 d2 drought events occurred in yunnan show various durations ranging from 3 to7 months there are nine wet events that are identified by our gnss dsi results table 3 the 2013 2014 and 2015 2016 water surplus events in yunnan lasted for 17 and 11 months respectively our results indicate that the midstream and downstream areas of the yangtze river are also vulnerable to hydrological disasters fig 9b in 2015 2016 an exceptionally wet period w4 occurred in may 2015 to july 2016 with a maximum severity of 2 08 in december 2015 this extreme is closely linked to a strong el niño ma et al 2018 and manifests prolonged periods of torrential rain and caused flood disaster in the middle lower yangtze plains due to the low terrain curved streamway and excessive deforestation another extremely wet w3 incident occurred from march 2012 to january 2013 and had the highest severity of 1 63 in may 2012 we observe three extreme droughts d3 lasting for 15 2010 12 2012 02 17 2013 02 2014 06 and 10 2018 03 2018 12 months and showing the lowest dsi values of 1 62 in april 2011 1 93 in january 2014 and 1 86 in june 2018 table 3 other abnormal to severe d0 d2 drought events are listed in table 3 the timing of water deficit events d2 d4 defined by gnss dsi is temporally correlated with the grace identified results ran et al 2021 sun et al 2018 wang et al 2020 both songhua and liao refer to songliao river basins are characterized by a temperate semi humid and semi arid monsoon climate and are subjected to alternating droughts and floods chen et al 2018 our gnss results indicate strong interannual variability fig 8d and 8e and five dry and three wet episodes in the songliao river basins table 3 and fig 9c a moderate drought lasted for 13 months in 2011 2012 and was followed a long term wet period with durations of 26 months 2012 04 2014 05 with the highest severity of 2 13 w4 the most lasting arid period occurred from june 2015 to may 2018 with the lowest dsi of 1 62 catalogued as an extreme drought d3 another moderately wet w1 event lasting for 19 months 2018 06 2019 12 had a maximum severity of 1 19 in february 2019 our results suggest that the continuously operating gnss network even with sparse spatial coverage can serve as a complementary tool to identify and quantify hydrological extremes the gnss dsi standardizes drought and flood induced total water deviations from climatological normal and can be applied to operational hydrological monitoring therefore using the gnss dsi together with the traditional hydrological monitoring tools will improve the predictions and management of hydrological extremes 5 conclusion we use gnss vertical crustal displacements in a sparse gnss array with the average station spacing of 232 km to investigate the continental water storage changes and compare with water products from the grace gldas models and precipitation data in mainland china we find considerable variations of annual water storage in southwestern china with the largest annual amplitude of 314 mm in the gnss inferred water estimates in comparison with 243 mm from the grace mascon solutions and 150 mm from the gldas model moreover a notable change of gnss inferred water storage occurs in the middle and lower section of the yangtze river which is in line with the grace measured results through analyzing the time varying water storage fluctuations we find that gnss succeeds in characterizing the seasonality of watershed scale water storage changes and shows good agreement with the temporal variations of monthly precipitation the gnss grace and gldas based water estimates show coherent temporal patterns in south china where terrestrial water displays large seasonality but weak correlations are found in north china due to subtle annual water changes we also suggest that gnss dsi is able to track drought and pluvial periods and to independently characterize hydrological extremes without additional constraints our inversion result demonstrates that a sparsely distributed gnss array such as the cmonoc network is sufficient to monitor the large scale surface mass redistribution credit
