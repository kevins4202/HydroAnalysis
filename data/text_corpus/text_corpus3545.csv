17725,dissolved organic matter dom in aquatic ecosystems reshapes the surface of nanoparticles nps greatly understanding how these changes influence the bioavailability of nps is critical for accurately predicting the ecological risks of nps a quantitative model based on the two step internalization process enabled the differentiation between the adhesion ability of nps to membranes and the internalization capacity using protozoa tetrahymena thermophila as the test organism fluorescein isothiocyanate modified silica nps fitc sio2 and silica coated gold nps au sio2 were prepared to validate the model and study the influence of dom on uptake dom reduced the ability of au sio2 to adhere onto cell membranes and the inhibitory effect of bovine serum albumin bsa and β lactoglobulin was higher due to their higher molecular weights and the weaker interaction moreover dom increased the internalization capacity 80 au sio2 was internalized in the presence of humic acid ha over 90 au sio2 was internalized in the presence of the two proteins whereas only 60 were internalized by the control group next the specific recognition of the cell internalization in the presence of dom was confirmed we concluded that the traditional accumulation may misestimate the true biological effect caused by nps coated with dom nps coated with highly bioavailable dom pose a greater risk to aquatic ecosystems because they are more likely to be internalized by living organisms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword organic matter nanoparticles internalization ability adhesion ability tetrahymena thermophila 1 introduction the increased use of engineered nanomaterials has caused an increasing amount of worry due to the deleterious effect of nanomaterials on global and local ecosystems ouyang et al 2018 the concentration of nanoparticles nps in aquatic systems could reach hazardous ppm levels ouyang et al 2018 xu et al 2018 due to their high specific surface area and chemical reactivity nps induce the excessive free radical production within cells increase oxidative stress nguyen et al 2018 and interfere with normal physiological and metabolic cellular activity schultz et al 2012 yue et al 2016 nps can also influence the distribution and transformation of heavy metal and organic pollutants guo et al 2002 wijayaratne and means 1984 which can be chaperoned into cells by a trojan horse effect yang et al 2014 determining and understanding the nps bioaccumulation is therefore essential as bioaccumulation is often a precondition for cytotoxicity liang et al 2020 wang et al 2016c dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in aquatic environments typically contains a variety complex organic matter compound including humic acid ha proteins polysaccharides lipids and so on grillo et al 2015 wang et al 2016c yin et al 2012 which could interact with nps altering their surface reactivity colloidal stability cellular uptake capability and their bioaccumulation nel et al 2009 wang et al 2016c understanding the influence of dom on the bioaccumulation of nps is critical for accurately predicting the ecological risks of nps how dom affects nps bioaccumulation is non trivial and is related to numerous parameters such as the nps surface properties the properties of dom the test organisms and various environmental factors nel et al 2009 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2016c yu et al 2018 the most widely accepted theory suggests that cellular uptake of nps in the presence of dom is determined by the interaction between nps and cell membrane which is influenced by electrostatic repulsion steric hindrance or suspension stabilization monikh et al 2020 wang et al 2016c however even though the influence of some organic substances on the adhesion of nps to cell membranes has been proven ha et al 2016 sinnecker et al 2014 stojiljkovic et al 2016 coating nps surfaces with these organic substances sometimes induces the opposite effect on their bioaccumulation liang et al 2020 stojiljkovic et al 2016 for instance a dom which encourages weaker interaction between cell membranes and nps will lead to stronger bioaccumulation liang et al 2020 this suggests that the adsorbed dom interferes with the nps internalization mechanism wang et al 2019 the internalization capacity of nps depends on the ability of nps to be uptaken by cells through direct penetration receptor mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis and is related to the cell type and the np s size charge surface coating and other surface properties hui et al 2019 moros et al 2012 although the internalization ratio has been described previously shi et al 2013 wei et al 2019 theoretical models which provide a meaningful indicator for describing quantitatively the internalization ability of cells for particles have not been applied furthermore there are no reports which differentiate between nps absorbed onto cell membranes and nps internalized within cells or tissues in the presence of dom the ability to distinguish between these quantitatively is important as nps that are not internalized may express only limited toxicological effects baalousha et al 2016 in this paper we used a kinetic model to describe both the membrane adsorption and subsequent internalization or endocytosis which followed the currently accepted mechanism for the cellular uptake of nps lesniak et al 2013 wilhelm et al 2002 in this model nps adsorbed onto cellular membranes and then passed through the membrane by either endocytosis phagocytosis or direct penetration which is dependent on their physicochemical properties behzadi et al 2017 wang et al 2016a zhu et al 2013 the model provided an affinity constant for the membrane nps interaction as well as an estimate for the total internalization capacity to the best of our knowledge the current study presents the first comprehensive description of the link between the physicochemical properties and biological uptake of nps in the presence of organic matter here the mechanism for the influence of dom on the bioaccumulation of sio2 nps in ciliate tetrahymena thermophila was explored using a validated kinetic model a sio2 nps was chosen because it is a common natural and synthetic nps found in aquatic ecosystems humic acid ha was selected as a representative humic substance while bovine serum albumin bsa and β lactoglobulin were also chosen as ideal model proteins samadarsi and dutta 2019 zhang et al 2020 overall the influence of dom on the nps internalization mechanism was examined from two perspectives the ability of nps to adhere onto cell membranes and the ability for nps to be internalized 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials bovine serum albumin bsa 66 kda and β lactoglobulin 18 4 kda were

fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc labelled sio2 nps 25 nm and citrate capped au nps 25 nm were synthesized according to previously published methods bastus et al 2011 herz et al 2009 a silica shell of 1 5 nm thickness was precipitated onto au cores yielding au sio2 according to the method described in si bsa was labelled with rhodamine b isothiocyanate λex λem 560 592 nm and purified using size exclusion chromatography wang et al 2019 the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of nps with and without dom substances after 12 h incubation at 25 c were determined by a zetasizer nano zs instrument malvern uk the nps particle size and dispersity were determined by transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100f japan the spectral properties of au sio2 nps were determined by uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan the dissolved au ions in 5 mg l au sio2 solution before and after 12 h incubation in the presence or absence of 10 mg l organic matters were isolated through ultrafiltration 4000 10 min using 100 kda ultrafiltration centrifuge tube the au ion concentration was determined by ion coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms agilent 7800 usa the quenching efficiency of co2 on the fitc sio2 fluorescence was studied by obtaining fluorescence spectra with under different concentrations of co2 specifically a solution of 50 mg l fitc sio2 was prepared in fresh water then cocl2 solution was added gradually the final co2 concentrations were 5 10 20 30 50 80 and 100 mmol l where the change in fluorescence intensity λex λem 480 513 nm was recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 7000 japan 2 3 the kinetic uptake of fitc sio2 in t thermophila t thermophila sb210 was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan the cells were cultured in a nutrient enriched medium at 28 c yang et al 2014 when the cells were in logarithmic phase after 24 36 h they were isolated by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 5 min and then washed with freshwater the cell pellets were resuspended in freshwater and the final cell densities were adjusted to 1 106 cells ml using a z2 coulter counter beckman coulter inc in for all uptake tests below cells were mixed with the same volume of exposure medium 1 1 to reach a final concentration of 5 105 cells ml the kinetic uptake of fitc sio2 20 30 and 50 mg l in t thermophila was conducted to validate the model in ecological systems where the amount of internalized and membrane adhered nanoparticles was distinguished the exposure process lasted 2 h at 25 c while the total bioaccumulation of fitc sio2 in t thermophila was determined at 10 20 40 60 90 and 120 min during the exposure process at each time point 1 ml of exposure media was taken out and centrifuged at 600 rpm for 3 min after that the cell pellets were washed twice with freshwater and resuspended to quantify the number of membrane adhered nps the same experiment was conducted at 4 c to minimize nps uptake here the cells and corresponding exposure medium fitc sio2 were placed at 4 c for 30 min then cells were mixed with the same volume of exposure medium and the exposure process conducted at 4 c while other conditions remained the same after 2 h exposure the detected nps bioaccumulation represented the equilibrium adhered amounts on the cell membrane the fluorescence intensity representing total bioaccumulation 25 c or the equilibrium adhered amounts 4 c of fitc sio2 was recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer the fluorescence intensity due to internalized fitc sio2 was determined by adding 50 mm cocl2 to resuspended cells which were collected at 25 c co2 only quenched fluorescence from fitc sio2 which were adhered onto the cell membrane whereas internalized fitc sio2 were protected from the co2 by the cell membrane figure s4 each experiment was conducted in triplicate 2 4 the kinetic uptake of au sio2 in the presence of different organic matters au sio2 was used to study the influence of model dom substances on nps uptake au sio2 10 mg l au nps were incubated with 20 mg l bsa β lactoglobulin or ha for 12 h and then t thermophila cells were mixed as described above section 2 3 the exposure process was also the same as described above section 2 3 for the determination of au sio2 bioaccumulation the cell pellets were digested using 0 25 ml aqua regia and then diluted to 5 ml using 2 hno3 for ion coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms elemental analysis measurements nexion 350 each experiment was repeated in triplicate 2 5 the model fitting according to wilhelm et al wilhelm et al 2002 the two step nps internalization process was divided into nps binding onto the cell membrane step 1 described as a langmuir adsorption and the subsequent independent internalization step step 2 described as a saturable mechanism the model was fitted based on the following equations room temperature 1 d m e x t t d t k a c m 0 k a c k d m e x t t d m int t d t 2 d m int t d t k i φ 0 φ int t m e x t t 3 d φ int t d t k i φ 0 φ int t 4 d m t d t d m e x t t d t d m int t d t k a c m 0 k a c k d m e x t t low temperature 5 m t m e x t t k a c m 0 k a c k d 1 exp k a c k d t 6 m max k a c m 0 k a c k d in these equations mext t mint t and m t represented the concentrations of membrane adsorbed nps on the cell membrane nps within the intracellular region and the total concentration at time t respectively m0 represented the maximum concentrations of membrane adsorbed nps on the cell membrane and c represented the concentrations of nps in the exposure medium ka kd and k i represented the association constant between nps and cell membrane the dissociation constant of nps from the cell membrane and the internalized constant of nps by the cell respectively φ 0 represented the internalization capacity which was the maximum fraction of the reactive surface that was internalized by the cell and φint t was the fraction of reactive surface being internalized at time t for the present study we validated and used a simplified calculation specifically the maximum amount of nps adsorption onto the cell membrane was obtained after 2 h exposure at 4 c which represented kacm0 kac kd up to 20 min after initial exposure the number of membrane adhered nps were ignored and the uptake rate was simplified as kacm0 therefore we used values for nps bioaccumulation after 10 and 20 min to then force them zero crossing to find the slope this enabled the calculation of kacm0 and kac kd from these two initial values the model was fitted using the kinetic data obtained at room temperature further details of the method are provided in the si the data was fitted using the openmodel 2 3 0 software package http www nottingham ac uk environmental modeling openmodel htm using the metropolis hastings procedure the intracellular distribution ratio of nps was calculated by dividing the intracellular number of nps by the total accumulation of nps which was both obtained by fitting the model when np accumulation was assumed to be at equilibrium 2 6 the effect of organic matter on the adsorption of au sio2 on model membrane the adhesion of au sio2 onto the model membrane was monitored at 25 c using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d q sense sweden after incubation of au sio2 with model dom substances free dom in solution was removed by centrifugation 10 000 g 15 min to avoid their deposition onto a supported lipid bilayer slb which may interfere with the au sio2 deposition nps coated with model dom substances were resuspended with freshwater to 500 mg l using sonication the same operation was applied to uncoated au sio2 for comparison a dopc vesicle stock suspension was prepared according to a published protocol wang et al 2016b the dopc vesicles were then deposited on a sio2 coated sensor and finally ruptured on the surface to form a model slb membrane further experimental details are provided in the si after the slb formation hepes buffer 10 mm hepes 150 mm nacl 4 8 mm naoh ph 7 4 was injected into the chamber to remove unabsorbed vesicles li et al 2018 wang et al 2016b pure water and freshwater were then successively flowed through to form a stable baseline after which 500 mg l coated or uncoated au sio2 was injected to deposit nps free solutions of model dom substances ha bsa or β lactoglobulin 50 mg l were also injected to determine their adsorption capacity on slb a flow rate of 150 μl min was maintained during the whole process zeng et al 2018 2 7 the verification of reactive surface finally the reactive surface and its specificity for certain organic substances was investigated using fluorescent derivatized bsa t thermophila cells were pre exposed to au sio2 in the presence of 10 mg l bsa β lactoglobulin or ha for 2 h as described above the exposure media was then removed and the cells were exposed to a second solution containing au sio2 coated with fluorescent rhodamine b tagged bsa after 2 h the cells were washed and resuspended to quantify the uptake of new au sio2 nps by fluorescence spectroscopy λex λem 560 592 nm each experiment was repeated in triplicate 2 8 data analysis an independent sample t test was used to analyze the differences between the control group and the exposed groups while studying the role of reactive surface p 0 05 was considered significant and was denoted by an asterisk 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characterization of nanoparticles the physicochemical properties of nps before and after exposure to the model dom are presented in table s2 and figure s1 fitc sio2 and au sio2 were both 25 nm in diameter with similar surface potential and hydrodynamic diameter therefore similar uptake behaviors were expected both nps were negatively charged in freshwater which was attributed to deprotonated silanol groups on the particle surface xu et al 2010 the adsorption of model dom substances onto nps surfaces had negligible influence on the surface potential but the hydrodynamic diameter of au sio2 was shown to decrease from 80 nm to 50 nm the effect of au ion release on the hydrodynamic diameter was negligible table s3 numerous studies have described the promotion of np dispersion with organic additives by introducing steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion as the organic matter was inevitably adsorbed onto the np surfaces ren et al 2017 wang et al 2016c however the zeta potential of au sio2 with dom substances was similar to that without dom in our study which suggested that electrostatic repulsion was not the cause of the decrease of au sio2 hydrodynamic diameter in the presence of dom therefore steric hindrance was deemed the most likely mechanism for reducing the hydrodynamic diameter of au sio2 yan et al 2019 3 2 model validation using t thermophila the intracellular distribution ratio of nps has been used to evaluate the bioavailability of nps and in turn adsorbed pollutants the model provided by wilhelm et al helped to calculate the distribution ratio wilhelm et al 2002 but the method was not validated therefore fluorescent fitc sio2 nps were used here to validate the model with t thermophila as the use of fitc sio2 was convenient for differentiating between and quantifying cell membrane adhered and internalized nps high concentrations of co2 quenched fitc fluorescence such that 85 of fluorescence signal was quenched at 50 mm co2 fig 1 a it was possible to differentiate the intra and extracellular fitc sio2 through addition of co2 as the cell membrane prevented the diffusion of co2 to internalized fluorescent nps to demonstrate this fluorescence micrographs of t thermophila were obtained after sequential exposure to fitc sio2 nps and 50 mm co2 figure s4 the green fluorescence signal was still observed in the intracellular region after the introduction of co2 the fluorescence signal remained constant for 10 min thus fluorescence quenching with co2 provided an ideal means to differentiate the intra and extracellular fitc sio2 in t thermophila as discussed earlier after the membrane adhesion ability of fitc sio2 was determined we fitted the data with a kinetic model which showed an excellent agreement to the experimentally obtained data r2 0 99 fig 1b the fitted curve of intracellular fluorescence also showed good agreement to the detected intracellular fluorescence this suggested that the model could also be applied to untagged nps whose intracellular portion could not be easily distinguished the calculations revealed that only 63 7 of the total fitc sio2 were internalized by the t thermophila while the experimental uptake data also reached a plateau at similar values several studies also investigated the intracellular distribution of sio2 and γfe2o3 nps which revealed that only a small portion of nps were actually internalized by the cell kurtz chalot et al 2014 kurtz chalot et al 2017 wilhelm et al 2003 the accuracy of our simplified method was validated also the internalization capacity φ 0 of fitc sio2 in three different concentrations 20 30 and 50 mg l were determined and showed an excellent agreement to the calculated fit figure s3 the calculated φ 0 was 8 25 0 94 13 12 0 79 and 8 03 0 89 at 20 30 and 50 mg l respectively we demonstrated that the fitted parameters were still sufficiently accurate despite simplifications as the φ0 was not changed with exposed concentrations of nps since the φ0 of t thermophila is known to be approximately 10 wilhelm et al reported that macrophages such as the special phagocytes showed a much higher φ 0 of 25 when compared with other zooblast types approximately 2 wilhelm and gazeau 2008 this suggested that the relative high φ 0 of t thermophila may relate to their remarkable phagocytic ability werlin et al 2011 3 3 the influence of organic matter on the adhesion and uptake of au sio2 the influence of model dom substances on nps uptake was studied in greater depth because extreme exposure and intracellular concentrations of fitc sio2 are necessary for suitable fluorescence signal they were not suitable for high precision studies instead au sio2 nps were used as concentrations could be quantified with icp ms which have much lower detection limits than fluorescence spectroscopy after t thermophila was exposed to au sio2 nps for 2 h the au sio2 nps were distributed in vesicles which indicated that nps were internalized by t thermophila cells in the same way as fitc sio2 nps figure s5 experimental au bioaccumulation data also showed good agreement with calculated fitting data fig 2 nearly 40 of au sio2 was adsorbed on the cell membrane when the total biological uptake reached equilibrium which was consistent with the distribution results of fitc sio2 au sio2 has a large number of silanol functional groups on its surface which can act as both a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor delle piane et al 2018 this gives the outer sio2 layer the propensity to interact with the surface exposed functional groups such as phosphates carboxylic acids and amines in the cell membrane through van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding delle piane et al 2018 mathelie guinlet et al 2017 shariati et al 2018 β lactoglobulin bsa and ha reduced the amount of au sio2 which adhered onto the cell membrane by 84 7 80 1 and 55 6 respectively fig s4 the same trend was observed from calculated affinity constants k table 1 and from qcm d studies into the influence of model dom substances on the interaction between au sio2 and model slb membranes fig 3 these results showed strong agreement with previous studies lesniak et al 2013 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2016b and suggested that the adhesion ability of au sio2 decreased in the presence of organic additives normally the presence of organic matters reduced the interaction between nps and cells e g algae bacteria through steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion wang et al 2016c zhao et al 2019 in our study the reduction of adhesion ability of au sio2 in the presence of model dom substances was attributed to enhanced steric hindrance because the model dom substances induced no apparent effect on the surface potential of au sio2 the organic coating also concealed surface exposed silanol and sio functional groups on au sio2 surfaces which limited their interaction with certain functional groups in the cell membrane wei et al 2016 bsa had the largest relative molecular mass compared to ha or β lactoglobulin which may have induced the most steric hindrance furthermore qcm d studies using the interaction of the bare model dom substances with an slb suggested that the adhesion mass of 50 mg l ha was higher than of β lactoglobulin and bsa fig 4 in fact 50 mg l bsa did not adhere at all previous studies suggested that ha interacts with phospholipid bilayers through both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic burial while bsa interacts only weakly with membranes elayan et al 2008 wei et al 2016 this qualified the fact that ha coated nanoparticles adhered more strongly to the membrane than proteins although calculated affinity constants for bsa and β lactoglobulin coated nps were similar the results from qcm d studies suggested that the ability of β lactoglobulin coated nps to adhere to the slb was better than that of bsa coated nps this was attributed to differences in composition between model and real membranes delle piane et al 2018 the model membrane only comprised phospholipids while real cell membranes comprised different phospholipids cholesterol contents glycation patterns and different ratios of exposed proteins the increased complexity of the real cell membrane was therefore expected to induce a different interaction with organic matter nanoparticles compared to the model membrane delle piane et al 2018 tada et al 2014 although the model dom substances reduced the ability for nps to adhere onto cell membranes they did not affect the total au bioaccumulation in fact bsa improved au bioaccumulation by 10 3 compared to the dom free control group it is apparent that the internalization ratios of au sio2 differed vastly in different scenarios which meant that the bioavailability of nps would also differ the calculated fit suggested that over 90 of au sio2 was internalized in the presence of bsa or β lactoglobulin while only 80 and 60 for the ha and control groups respectively therefore it is suggested that misleading quantitative uptake of internalized nanoparticles may lead to large misestimation of the cytotoxicity of nps feliu et al 2016 the amount of internalized au increased in all situations with the presence of model dom bsa promoted au bioaccumulation by 70 compared to the control group yallapu et al reported that soluble protein promoted the intracellular uptake of magnetic nps yallapu et al 2015 a generally accepted theory suggests that biological uptake of nps in the presence of dom relates to the adhesion ability of nps which could be affected by electrostatic repulsion steric hindrance or suspension stabilization wang et al 2016c rio echevarria et al reported that the uptake of sio2 nps coated with epoxy was significantly higher than uncoated sio2 nps because of a stronger interaction with the cell membrane rio echevarria et al 2019 however our experimental and calculated data revealed that the interaction between au sio2 and cell membrane cannot explain the increase of internalization after excluding the influence of adsorption ability we concluded that the increase of internalized au sio2 in the presence of dom came from an increase of φ 0 this compensated for the loss of adsorption ability especially when proteins were used the φ 0 is related to the endocytic capacity of cells and is reflected by the abundance of receptors on the cell membrane for nutrient uptake the receptor mediated endocytosis helps to selectively internalize specific macromolecules alberts 2009 in this case the macromolecules on nps surfaces would imbue their specific identity to the nps monopoli et al 2012 nel et al 2009 t thermophila has more receptors for proteins than for ha from the data on reactive surface φ0 table 1 durichen et al reported that chemical recognition by tetrahymena pyriformis resulted in higher uptake rates of microparticles coated with bsa or enzymes durichen et al 2016 our previous studies also confirmed that proteins can increase the accumulation of nanomaterials entering cells through endocytosis and it is inferred that au sio2 in the current study entered cells by the same mechanism liang et al 2020 ojea jimenez et al 2016 wang et al 2019 interestingly the φ 0 for the ha group was relatively similar to the control group this may explain why so few studies have reported that ha evaluated the biological uptake of nanomaterials as the receptors for ha on cell membranes may be limited especially compared to receptors for proteins overall the model provided a simple way to estimating the abundance of receptors for different dom substances 3 4 the role of reactive surface in the uptake process the critical role of reactive surfaces in the biological uptake of nps was then studied after pre incubation with au sio2 in the presence of model dom substances the exposure media was removed and the t thermophila cells were further exposed with au sio2 coated with rhodamine b labelled bsa when t thermophila was pre incubated with bsa fewer au sio2 were internalized in the second exposure suggesting that the available reactive surface for bsa coated nps was reduced fig 5 importantly the reactive surface showed specificity for nps internalization which supported the connection between reactive surface and receptors however we determined previously that the available reactive surface for bsa coated nanoparticles was totally depleted after 2 h exposure fig 2 which implies that the second exposure would lead to a negligible nps uptake however the reduction effect was far weaker than expected see fig 5 which suggested that the available reactive surface was not completely coated during the first exposure it is possible that the adsorption of protein on nps surfaces would also affect the φ 0 as more protein molecules would increase the possibility of contact between protein and receptor as discussed before the biological uptake of nps increased only when the φ 0 for protein coating would be large enough to compensate the loss of adsorption ability while φ 0 highly depended on the cell type and amount of protein adsorbed this suggested that cells containing more receptors for the dom constituents of the nps coating would internalize more nps for instance serum proteins increased nps uptake only in mcf7 cells table s3 in ecological systems the heterotrophic ciliates are known for their phagocytic ability aijaz and koudelka 2017 bioaccumulation of nanomaterials also occurs frequently at the bacteria protozoan trophic level dong et al 2018 werlin et al 2011 therefore it is expected that bioaccumulation will be dramatically more prevalent with nps coated with dom which poses a greater threat to predators in general organic matter could reduce the adhesion of nps onto cell membranes however some organic matter such as protein is highly bioavailable and recognized by abundant receptors featured in cell membranes if such organic matter is adsorbed onto nps then the np may be recognized on cell surfaces become strongly adhered and therefore more likely to be internalized leading to be a higher φ 0 this in turn may increase the toxicity and ecological risk of nps our findings suggested that more attention should be paid to the ecological risk of nps in aquatic environments and the effect of treatment processes for wastewater containing nps in the presence of different organic matters in particular in the presence of other wastewater contaminants such as heavy metals organic pollutants and antibiotics a larger range of pollutants may become internalized through the trojan horse effect naasz et al 2018 which may also cause higher biological toxicity and environmental risks since different types of organic matter affected np internalization in different ways the removal of specific organic matter with the highest bioavailability would greatly reduce environmental risks in the wastewater treatment processes 4 conclusion above all the influence of dom on the biological uptake of nps was divided into two aspects firstly the ability for nps to adhere onto cell membranes was reduced by the dom substances which coated the nps and this was related to the molecular weight of the organic matter and the interaction between the cell membrane and organic matter secondly the organic matter coating on nps affected the number of membrane receptors that recognized the nps the organic matter increased the number of cell membrane receptors that can recognize the nps and thereby increased the rate and capacity of nps internalization especially for proteins our results highlighted the falsely quantitative uptake of internalized nanoparticles may lead to large misestimations of nps cytotoxicity and that organic matter coated nps are greater to risk to aquatic ecosystems as they are more likely to be internalized by living

accurately predicting the ecological risks of nps a quantitative model based on the two step internalization process enabled the differentiation between the adhesion ability of nps to membranes and the internalization capacity using protozoa tetrahymena thermophila as the test organism fluorescein isothiocyanate modified silica nps fitc sio2 and silica coated gold nps au sio2 were prepared to validate the model and study the influence of dom on uptake dom reduced the ability of au sio2 to adhere onto cell membranes and the inhibitory effect of bovine serum albumin bsa and β lactoglobulin

sio2 was internalized in the presence of the two proteins whereas only 60 were internalized by the control group next the specific recognition of the cell internalization in the presence of dom was

et al 2019 wang et al 2016c yu et al 2018 the most widely accepted theory suggests that cellular uptake of nps in the presence of dom is determined by the interaction between nps and cell membrane which is influenced by electrostatic repulsion steric hindrance or suspension stabilization monikh et al 2020 wang et al 2016c however even though the influence of some organic substances on the adhesion of nps to cell membranes has been proven ha et al 2016 sinnecker et al 2014 stojiljkovic et al 2016 coating nps surfaces with these organic substances sometimes induces the opposite effect on their bioaccumulation liang et al 2020 stojiljkovic et al 2016 for instance a dom which encourages weaker interaction between cell membranes and nps will lead to stronger bioaccumulation liang et al 2020 this suggests that the adsorbed dom interferes with the nps internalization mechanism wang et al 2019 the internalization capacity of nps depends on the ability of nps to be uptaken by cells through direct penetration receptor mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis and is related to the cell type and the np s size charge surface coating and other surface properties hui et al 2019 moros et al 2012 although the internalization ratio has been described previously shi et al 2013 wei et al 2019 theoretical models which provide a meaningful indicator for describing quantitatively the internalization ability of cells for particles have not been applied furthermore there are no reports which differentiate between nps absorbed onto cell membranes and nps internalized within cells or tissues in the presence of dom the ability to distinguish between these quantitatively is important as nps that are not internalized may express only limited toxicological effects baalousha et al 2016 in this paper we used a kinetic model to describe both the membrane adsorption and subsequent internalization or endocytosis which followed the currently accepted mechanism for the cellular uptake of nps lesniak et al 2013 wilhelm et al 2002 in this model nps adsorbed onto cellular membranes and then passed through the membrane by either endocytosis phagocytosis or direct penetration which is dependent on their physicochemical properties behzadi et al 2017 wang et al 2016a zhu et al 2013 the model provided an affinity constant for the membrane nps interaction as well as an estimate for the total internalization capacity to the best of our knowledge the current study presents the first comprehensive description of the link between the physicochemical properties and biological uptake of nps in the presence of organic matter here the mechanism for the influence of dom on the bioaccumulation of sio2 nps in ciliate tetrahymena thermophila was explored using a validated kinetic model a sio2 nps was chosen because it is a common natural and synthetic nps found in aquatic ecosystems humic acid ha was selected as a representative humic substance while bovine serum albumin bsa and β lactoglobulin were also chosen as ideal model proteins samadarsi and dutta 2019 zhang et al 2020 overall the influence of dom on the nps internalization mechanism was examined from two perspectives the ability of nps to adhere onto cell membranes and the ability for nps to be internalized 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials bovine serum albumin bsa 66 kda and β lactoglobulin 18 4 kda were

exclusion chromatography wang et al 2019 the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of nps with and without dom substances after 12 h incubation at 25 c were determined by a zetasizer nano zs instrument malvern uk the nps particle size and dispersity were determined by transmission electron microscopy tem jem 2100f japan the spectral properties of au sio2 nps were determined by uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan the dissolved au ions in 5 mg l au sio2 solution before and after 12 h incubation in the presence or absence of 10 mg l organic matters were isolated through ultrafiltration 4000 10 min using 100 kda ultrafiltration centrifuge tube the au ion concentration was determined by ion coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms agilent 7800 usa the quenching efficiency of co2 on the fitc sio2 fluorescence was studied by obtaining fluorescence spectra with under different concentrations of co2 specifically a solution of 50 mg l fitc sio2 was prepared in fresh water then cocl2 solution was added gradually the final co2 concentrations were 5 10 20 30 50 80 and 100 mmol l where the change in fluorescence intensity λex λem 480 513 nm was recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 7000 japan 2 3 the kinetic uptake of fitc sio2 in t thermophila t thermophila sb210 was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan the cells were cultured in a nutrient enriched medium at 28 c yang et al 2014 when the cells were in logarithmic phase after 24 36 h they were isolated by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 5 min and then washed with freshwater the cell pellets were resuspended in freshwater and the final cell densities were adjusted to 1 106 cells ml using a z2 coulter counter beckman coulter inc in for all uptake tests below cells were mixed with the same volume of exposure medium 1 1 to reach a final concentration of 5 105 cells ml the kinetic uptake of fitc sio2 20 30 and 50 mg l in t thermophila was conducted to validate the model in ecological systems where the amount of internalized and membrane adhered nanoparticles was distinguished the exposure process lasted 2 h at 25 c while the total bioaccumulation of fitc sio2 in t thermophila was determined at 10 20 40 60 90 and 120 min during the exposure process at each time point 1 ml of exposure media was taken out and centrifuged at 600 rpm for 3 min after that the cell pellets were washed twice with freshwater and resuspended to quantify the number of membrane adhered nps the same experiment was conducted at 4 c to minimize nps uptake here the cells and corresponding exposure medium fitc sio2 were placed at 4 c for 30 min then cells were mixed with the same volume of exposure medium and the exposure process conducted at 4 c while other conditions remained the same after 2 h exposure the detected nps bioaccumulation represented the equilibrium adhered amounts on the cell membrane the fluorescence intensity representing total bioaccumulation 25 c or the equilibrium adhered amounts 4 c of fitc sio2 was recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer the fluorescence intensity due to internalized fitc sio2 was determined by adding 50 mm cocl2 to resuspended cells which were collected at 25 c co2 only quenched fluorescence from fitc sio2 which were adhered onto the cell membrane whereas internalized fitc sio2 were protected from the co2 by the cell membrane figure s4 each experiment was conducted in triplicate 2 4 the kinetic uptake of au sio2 in the presence of different organic matters au sio2 was used to study the influence of model dom substances on nps uptake au sio2 10 mg l au nps were incubated with 20 mg l bsa β lactoglobulin or ha for 12 h and then t thermophila cells were mixed as described above section 2 3 the exposure process was also the same as described above section 2 3 for the determination of au sio2 bioaccumulation the cell pellets were digested using 0 25 ml aqua regia and then diluted to 5 ml using 2 hno3 for ion coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms elemental analysis measurements nexion 350 each experiment was repeated in triplicate 2 5 the model fitting according to wilhelm et al wilhelm et al 2002 the two step nps internalization process was divided into nps binding onto the cell membrane step 1 described as a langmuir adsorption and the subsequent independent internalization step step 2 described as a saturable mechanism the model was fitted based on the following equations room temperature 1 d m e x t t d t k a c m 0 k a c k d m e x t t d m

region and the total concentration at time t respectively m0 represented the maximum concentrations of membrane adsorbed nps on the cell membrane and c represented the concentrations of nps in the exposure medium ka kd and k i represented the association constant between nps and cell membrane the dissociation constant of nps from the cell membrane and the internalized constant of nps by the cell respectively φ 0 represented the internalization capacity which was the maximum fraction of the reactive surface that was internalized by the cell and φint t was the fraction of reactive surface being internalized at time t for the present study we validated and used a simplified calculation specifically the maximum amount of nps adsorption onto the cell membrane was obtained after 2 h exposure at 4 c which represented kacm0 kac kd up to 20 min after initial exposure the number of membrane adhered nps were ignored and the uptake rate was simplified as kacm0 therefore we used values for nps bioaccumulation after 10 and 20 min to then force them zero crossing to find the slope this enabled the calculation of kacm0 and kac kd from these two initial values the model was fitted using the kinetic data obtained at room temperature further details of the method are provided in the si the data was fitted using the openmodel 2 3 0 software package http www nottingham ac uk environmental modeling openmodel htm using the metropolis hastings procedure the intracellular distribution ratio of nps was calculated by dividing the intracellular number of nps by the total accumulation of nps which was both obtained by fitting the model when np accumulation was assumed to be at equilibrium 2 6 the effect of organic matter on the adsorption of au sio2 on model membrane the adhesion of au sio2 onto the model membrane was monitored at 25 c using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring qcm d q sense sweden after incubation of au sio2 with model dom substances free dom in solution was removed by centrifugation 10 000 g 15 min to avoid their deposition onto a supported lipid bilayer slb which may interfere with the au sio2 deposition nps coated with model dom substances were resuspended with freshwater to 500 mg l using sonication the same operation was applied to uncoated au sio2 for comparison a dopc vesicle stock suspension was prepared according to a published protocol wang et al 2016b the dopc vesicles were then deposited on a sio2 coated sensor and finally ruptured on the surface to form a model slb membrane further experimental details are provided in the si after the slb formation hepes buffer 10 mm hepes 150 mm nacl 4 8 mm naoh ph 7 4 was injected into the chamber to remove unabsorbed vesicles li et al 2018 wang et al 2016b pure water and freshwater were then successively flowed through to form a stable baseline after which 500 mg l coated or uncoated au sio2 was injected to deposit nps free solutions of model dom substances ha bsa or β lactoglobulin 50 mg l were also injected to determine their adsorption capacity on slb a flow rate of 150 μl min was maintained during the whole process zeng et al 2018 2 7 the verification of reactive surface finally the reactive surface and its specificity for certain organic substances was investigated using fluorescent derivatized bsa t thermophila cells were pre exposed to au sio2 in the presence of 10 mg l bsa β lactoglobulin or ha for 2 h as described above the exposure media was then removed and the cells were exposed to a second solution containing au sio2 coated with fluorescent rhodamine b tagged bsa after 2 h the cells were washed and resuspended to quantify the uptake of new au sio2 nps by fluorescence spectroscopy λex λem 560 592 nm each experiment was repeated in triplicate 2 8 data analysis an independent sample t test was used to analyze the differences between the control group and the exposed groups while studying the role of reactive surface p 0 05 was considered significant and was denoted by an asterisk 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characterization of nanoparticles the physicochemical properties of nps before and after exposure to the model dom are presented in table s2 and figure s1 fitc sio2 and au sio2 were both 25 nm in diameter with similar surface potential and hydrodynamic diameter therefore similar uptake behaviors were expected both nps were negatively charged in freshwater which was attributed to deprotonated silanol groups on the particle surface xu et al 2010 the adsorption of model dom substances onto nps surfaces had negligible influence on the surface potential but the hydrodynamic diameter of au sio2 was shown to decrease from 80 nm to 50 nm the effect of au ion release on the hydrodynamic diameter was negligible table s3 numerous studies have described the promotion of np dispersion with organic additives by introducing steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion as the organic matter was inevitably adsorbed onto the np surfaces ren et al 2017 wang et al 2016c however the zeta potential of au sio2 with dom substances was similar to that without dom in our study which suggested that electrostatic repulsion was not the cause of the decrease of au sio2 hydrodynamic diameter in the presence of dom therefore steric hindrance was deemed the most likely mechanism for reducing the hydrodynamic diameter of au sio2 yan et al 2019 3 2 model validation using t thermophila the intracellular distribution ratio of nps has been used to evaluate the bioavailability of nps and in turn adsorbed pollutants the model provided by wilhelm et al helped to calculate the distribution ratio wilhelm et al 2002 but the method was not validated therefore fluorescent fitc sio2 nps were used here to validate the model with t thermophila as the use of fitc sio2 was convenient for differentiating between and quantifying cell membrane adhered and internalized nps high concentrations of co2 quenched fitc fluorescence such that 85 of fluorescence signal was quenched at 50 mm co2 fig 1 a it was possible to differentiate the intra and extracellular fitc sio2 through addition of co2 as the cell membrane prevented the diffusion of co2 to internalized fluorescent nps to demonstrate this fluorescence micrographs of t thermophila were obtained after sequential exposure to fitc sio2 nps and 50 mm co2 figure s4 the green fluorescence signal was still observed in the intracellular region after the introduction of co2 the fluorescence signal remained constant for 10 min thus fluorescence quenching with co2 provided an ideal means to differentiate the intra and extracellular fitc sio2 in t thermophila as discussed earlier after the membrane adhesion ability of fitc sio2 was determined we fitted the data with a kinetic model which showed an excellent agreement to the experimentally obtained data r2 0 99 fig 1b the fitted curve of intracellular fluorescence also showed good agreement to the detected intracellular fluorescence this suggested that the model could also be applied to untagged nps whose intracellular portion could not be easily distinguished the calculations revealed that only 63 7 of the total fitc sio2 were internalized by the t thermophila while the experimental uptake data also reached a plateau at similar values several studies also investigated the intracellular distribution of sio2 and γfe2o3 nps which revealed that only a small portion of nps were actually internalized by the cell kurtz chalot et al 2014 kurtz chalot et al 2017 wilhelm et al 2003 the accuracy of our simplified method was validated also the internalization capacity φ 0 of fitc sio2 in three different concentrations 20 30 and 50 mg l were determined and showed an excellent agreement to the calculated fit figure s3 the calculated φ 0 was 8 25 0 94 13 12 0 79 and 8 03 0 89 at 20 30 and 50 mg l respectively we demonstrated that the fitted parameters were still sufficiently accurate despite simplifications as the φ0 was not changed with exposed concentrations of nps since the φ0 of t thermophila is known to be approximately 10 wilhelm et al reported that macrophages such as the special phagocytes showed a much higher φ 0 of 25 when compared with other zooblast types approximately 2 wilhelm and gazeau 2008 this suggested that the relative high φ 0 of t thermophila may relate to their remarkable phagocytic ability werlin et al 2011 3 3 the influence of organic matter on the adhesion and uptake of au sio2 the influence of model dom substances on nps uptake was studied in greater depth because extreme exposure and intracellular concentrations of fitc sio2 are necessary for suitable fluorescence signal they were not suitable for high precision studies instead au sio2 nps were used as concentrations could be quantified with icp ms which have much lower detection limits than fluorescence spectroscopy after t thermophila was exposed to au sio2 nps for 2 h the au sio2 nps were distributed in vesicles which indicated that nps were internalized by t thermophila cells in the same way as fitc sio2 nps figure s5 experimental au bioaccumulation data also showed good agreement with calculated fitting data fig 2 nearly 40 of au sio2 was adsorbed on the cell membrane when the total biological uptake reached equilibrium which was consistent with the distribution results of fitc sio2 au sio2 has a large number of silanol functional groups on its surface which can act as both a hydrogen bond donor and a hydrogen bond acceptor delle piane et al 2018 this gives the outer sio2 layer the propensity to interact with the surface exposed functional groups such as phosphates carboxylic acids and amines in the cell membrane through van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding delle piane et al 2018 mathelie guinlet et al 2017 shariati et al 2018 β lactoglobulin bsa and ha reduced the amount of au sio2 which adhered onto the cell membrane by 84 7 80 1 and 55 6 respectively fig s4 the same trend was observed from calculated affinity constants k table 1 and from qcm d studies into the influence of model dom substances on the interaction between au sio2 and model slb membranes fig 3 these results showed strong agreement with previous studies lesniak et al 2013 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2016b and suggested that the adhesion ability of au sio2 decreased in the presence of organic additives normally the presence of organic matters reduced the interaction between nps and cells e g algae bacteria through steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion wang et al 2016c zhao et al 2019 in our study the reduction of adhesion ability of au sio2 in the presence of model dom substances was attributed to enhanced steric hindrance because the model dom substances induced no apparent effect on the surface potential of au sio2 the organic coating also concealed surface exposed silanol and sio functional groups on au sio2 surfaces which limited their interaction with certain functional groups in the cell membrane wei et al 2016 bsa had the largest relative molecular mass compared to ha or β lactoglobulin which may have induced the most steric hindrance furthermore qcm d studies using the interaction of the bare model dom substances with an slb suggested that the adhesion mass of 50 mg l ha was higher than of β lactoglobulin and bsa fig 4 in fact 50 mg l bsa did not adhere at all previous studies suggested that ha interacts with phospholipid bilayers through both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic burial while bsa interacts only weakly with membranes elayan et al 2008 wei et al 2016 this qualified the fact that ha coated nanoparticles adhered more strongly to the membrane than proteins although calculated affinity constants for bsa and β lactoglobulin coated nps were similar the results from qcm d studies suggested that the ability of β lactoglobulin coated nps to adhere to the slb was better than that of bsa coated nps this was attributed to differences in composition between model and real membranes delle piane et al 2018 the model membrane only comprised phospholipids while real cell membranes comprised different phospholipids cholesterol contents glycation patterns and different ratios of exposed proteins the increased complexity of the real cell membrane was therefore expected to induce a different interaction with organic matter nanoparticles compared to the model membrane delle piane et al 2018 tada et al 2014 although the model dom substances reduced the ability for nps to adhere onto cell membranes they did not affect the total au bioaccumulation in fact bsa improved au bioaccumulation by 10 3 compared to the dom free control group it is apparent that the internalization ratios of au sio2 differed vastly in different scenarios which meant that the bioavailability of nps would also differ the calculated fit suggested that over 90 of au sio2 was internalized in the presence of bsa or β lactoglobulin while only 80 and 60 for the ha and control groups respectively therefore it is suggested that misleading quantitative uptake of internalized nanoparticles may lead to large misestimation of the cytotoxicity of nps feliu et al 2016 the amount of internalized au increased in all situations with the presence of model dom bsa promoted au bioaccumulation by 70 compared to the control group yallapu et al reported that soluble protein promoted the intracellular uptake of magnetic nps yallapu et al 2015 a generally accepted theory suggests that biological uptake of nps in the presence of dom relates to the adhesion ability of nps which could be affected by electrostatic repulsion steric hindrance or suspension stabilization wang et al 2016c rio echevarria et al reported that the uptake of sio2 nps coated with epoxy was significantly higher than uncoated sio2 nps because of a stronger interaction with the cell membrane rio echevarria et al 2019 however our experimental and calculated data revealed that the interaction between au sio2 and cell membrane cannot explain the increase of internalization after excluding the influence of adsorption ability we concluded that the increase of internalized au sio2 in the presence of dom came from an increase of φ 0 this compensated for the loss of adsorption ability especially when proteins were used the φ 0 is related to the endocytic capacity of cells and is reflected by the abundance of receptors on the cell membrane for nutrient uptake the receptor mediated endocytosis helps to selectively internalize specific macromolecules alberts 2009 in this case the macromolecules on nps surfaces would imbue their specific identity to the nps monopoli et al 2012 nel et al 2009 t thermophila has more receptors for proteins than for ha from the data on reactive surface φ0 table 1 durichen et al reported that chemical recognition by tetrahymena pyriformis resulted in higher uptake rates of microparticles coated with bsa or enzymes durichen et al 2016 our previous studies also confirmed that proteins can increase the accumulation of nanomaterials entering cells through endocytosis and it is inferred that au sio2 in the current study entered cells by the same mechanism liang et al 2020 ojea jimenez et al 2016 wang et al 2019 interestingly the φ 0 for the ha group was relatively similar to the control group this may explain why so few studies have reported that ha evaluated the biological uptake of nanomaterials as the receptors for ha on cell membranes may be limited especially compared to receptors for proteins overall the model provided a simple way to estimating the abundance of receptors for different dom substances 3 4 the role of reactive surface in the uptake process the critical role of reactive surfaces in the biological uptake of nps was then studied after pre incubation with au sio2 in the presence of model dom substances the exposure media was removed and the t thermophila cells were further exposed with au sio2 coated with rhodamine b labelled bsa when t thermophila was pre incubated with bsa fewer au sio2 were internalized in the second exposure suggesting that the available reactive surface for bsa coated nps was reduced fig 5 importantly the reactive surface showed specificity for nps internalization which supported the connection between reactive surface and receptors however we determined previously that the available reactive surface for bsa coated nanoparticles was totally depleted after 2 h exposure fig 2 which implies that the second exposure would lead to a negligible nps uptake however the reduction effect was far weaker than expected see fig 5 which suggested that the available reactive surface was not completely coated during the first exposure it is possible that the adsorption of protein on nps surfaces would also affect the φ 0 as more protein molecules would increase the possibility of contact between protein and receptor as discussed before the biological uptake of nps increased only when the φ 0 for protein coating would be large enough to compensate the loss of adsorption ability while φ 0 highly depended on the cell type and amount of protein adsorbed this suggested that cells containing more receptors for the dom constituents of the nps coating would internalize more nps for instance serum proteins increased nps uptake only in mcf7 cells table s3 in ecological systems the heterotrophic ciliates are known for their phagocytic ability aijaz and koudelka 2017 bioaccumulation of nanomaterials also occurs frequently at the bacteria protozoan trophic level dong et al 2018 werlin et al 2011 therefore it is expected that bioaccumulation will be dramatically more prevalent with nps coated with dom which poses a greater threat to predators in general organic matter could reduce the adhesion of nps onto cell membranes however some organic matter such as protein is highly bioavailable and recognized by abundant receptors featured in cell membranes if such organic matter is adsorbed onto nps then the np may be recognized on cell surfaces become strongly adhered and therefore more likely to be internalized leading to be a higher φ 0 this in turn may increase the toxicity and ecological risk of nps our findings suggested that more attention should be paid to the ecological risk of nps in aquatic environments and the effect of treatment processes for wastewater containing nps in the presence of different organic matters in particular in the presence of other wastewater contaminants such as heavy metals organic pollutants and antibiotics a larger range of pollutants may become internalized through the trojan horse effect naasz et al 2018 which may also cause higher biological toxicity and environmental risks since different types of organic matter affected np internalization in different ways the removal of specific organic matter with the highest bioavailability would greatly reduce environmental risks in the wastewater treatment processes 4 conclusion above all the influence of dom on the biological uptake of nps was divided into two aspects firstly the ability for nps to adhere onto cell membranes was reduced by the dom substances which coated the nps and this was related to the molecular weight of the organic matter and the interaction between the cell membrane and organic matter secondly the organic matter coating on nps affected the number of membrane receptors that recognized the nps the organic matter increased the number of cell membrane receptors that can recognize the nps and thereby increased the rate and capacity of nps internalization especially for proteins our results highlighted the falsely quantitative uptake of internalized nanoparticles may lead to large misestimations of nps cytotoxicity and that organic matter coated nps are greater to risk to aquatic ecosystems as they are more likely to be internalized by living

of engineering energy economy and environment we first illustrate the criteria and the key performance indicators to evaluate the performance of brackish water desalination we then systematically summarize technological information of ro and cdi focusing on the effect of key parameters on desalination performance as well as energy water efficiency economic costs and environmental impacts including carbon footprint we provide in depth discussion on the interconnectivity between desalination and energy and the trade off between kinetics and energetics for ro and cdi as critical factors for comparison we also critique the results of technical economic assessment for ro and cdi plants in the context of large scale deployment with focus on lifetime oriented consideration to total costs balance between energy efficiency and clean water production and pretreatment post treatment requirements finally we illustrate the challenges and opportunities for future brackish water desalination including hybridization for energy efficient brackish water desalination co removal of specific components in brackish water and sustainable brine management with innovative utilization our study reveals that both ro and cdi should play important roles in water reclamation and resource recovery from brackish water especially for inland cities or rural regions graphical abstract this article presents the advances of brackish water desalination using reverse osmosis and capacitive deionization and associated challenges and opportunities image 1 keywords electrokinetics energy consumption water productivity brine utilization carbon footprint hybridization 1 introduction due to rapid population growth and resource depletion freshwater stress and scarcity are one of the most severe challenges around the world especially in countries such as saudi arabia aljohani 2017 jordan qasim et al 2018 and tunisia walha et al 2007 seawater a salinity 35 g l is considered an infinite water resource and seawater desalination by reverse osmosis ro using semipermeable membranes has been practiced at commercial scales for decades at numerous countries such as israel segal et al 2018 australia linge et al 2013 spain quevedo et al 2011 and the us rao et al 2018 and is believed to be the most optimized technology for seawater desalination usdoe 2014 existing seawater ro swro plants operate near the thermodynamic limit where the applied pressure is only 10 20 higher than the osmotic pressure of the concentrate elimelech and phillip 2011 the energy consumption of an industrial scale swro is typically on the order of 2 5 4 0 kwh m3 shannon et al 2008 subramani et al 2014 yangali quintanilla et al 2011 producing freshwater at an average cost of 0 5 1 2 usd m3 kim et al 2010a nanda 2018 however ro becomes less energy efficient for brackish water desalination due to the high energy consumption per ion amy et al 2017 brackish water salinity of 1 10 g l elimelech and phillip 2011 is an essential water desalination alternative when compared to seawater potentially enabling the movement of the water energy nexus away from the seacoast further inland this allows for production of clean water at lower operating cost and lower energy burden already a shift to using brackish water as the water source has been sharply increasing in water stressed regions such as egypt allam et al 2002 sources of brackish water include groundwater naturally saline aquifers rivers wastewater e g hydraulic fracturing cooling water human activities and industrial processes and irrigation return flow so far brackish water desalination represents over 21 of the total worldwide desalination capacity jones et al 2019 compared to seawater desalination most desalination plants using brackish water have much lower production capacity between 500 and 10 000 m3 per day jaber and ahmed 2004 even up to 76 000 m3 per day in the us mickley 2001 despite the relatively lower production capacity the inland brackish water desalination plants can provide a vital solution to solve the water stress and scarcity in remoted areas electrokinetic desalination technologies such as capacitive deionization cdi have attracted great attention for water reuse due to their energy efficient separation of ionized or ionizable species from solutions cdi are broadly defined as a category of ion separation technologies where electrodes are cyclically charged and discharged regardless of deionization mechanisms or electrodes biesheuvel et al 2017 it is noteworthy that non cyclical characteristics have been achieved in recent cdi design such as flow electrode cdi he et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in cdi charged ions are electrically separated through the formation of electrical double layers edls to produce fit for purpose water delgado et al 2019 pan et al 2018a as a result the energy consumption in cdi correlates with the quantity of ions removed cdi also could apply an electrical current to drive faradaic reactions such as redox cathode anode and intercalation reactions zhang et al 2018 this provides opportunities of simultaneous oxidation and separation for other contaminants in brackish water however cdi is typically not effective to remove uncharged organics and biological species which is the biggest difference to ro as climate change and population increase continue well into the 21st century water stress will continue to be a major concern and will thus drive increases in brackish water desalination technologies for brackish water desalination will consume a significant amount of energy and the energy intensity of desalination facilities will affect the cost effectiveness and environmental impacts of the plant to the best of our knowledge little to none research has been focused on addressing the water and energy nexus for brackish water desalination using ro and cdi in this article we review the recent advances of the performance of ro and cdi for brackish water desalination from the energy economic and environmental aspects we first illustrate the criteria and the key performance indicators to evaluate the performance of brackish water desalination next we systematically gather technological information of ro and cdi for brackish water desalination published in the recent years a summary on the effect of key parameters on desalination performance as well as energy water efficiency economic costs and environmental impacts are included we provide in depth discussion on the interconnectivity between desalination and energy and discuss the trade off between kinetics and energetics for ro and cdi we also compare the results of technical economic assessment for ro and cdi plants in the context of large scale deployment and discuss the engineering design construction and operation from the lifetime oriented considerations finally we illustrate the challenges and opportunities of desalination for brackish water 2 criteria and key performance indicators for brackish water desalination the performance of a desalination facility depends on the types of the applied materials e g electrodes and membranes in desalination facilities and the operating conditions e g flow rate applied current and pressure when determining the performance of a desalination facility we should establish a standard evaluation procedure that first defines feed salinity c o and required salinity removal ratio η and then measure three indicators that are largely related to the cost effectiveness of a process i specific energy consumption ii water recovery ratio and iii productivity of clean water from the processes this consideration has been critically addressed and discussed in the review paper published by hawks et al 2019 eq 1 gives the removal ratio of salinity η quantified by the fraction of ions removed through the desalination facilities 1 η c o c i c o 100 where c o and c i are the salinity g l of feed and effluent streams respectively in this part we briefly illustrate the definition of several key performance indicators including the treatment capacity water recovery specific energy consumption and operation and maintenance o m costs we also discuss the importance of the environmental impacts and carbon footprints when evaluating the performance and cost effectiveness of a desalination facility 2 1 treatment capacity and recovery treatment capacity q i and water recovery r are essential to evaluating the cost effectiveness of a desalination plant the r value of a desalination plant also directly determines the volume of the rejection brine which requires subsequent treatment and management the r value can be determined by eq 2 2 r c l e a n w a t e r p r o d u c t i o n t r e a t m e n t c a p a c i t y q o q i 100 where q i and q o are the flow rate of feed water and permeate clean water respectively the r value is dependent on the ion removal mechanisms of a desalination facility as well as the types of the applied materials e g electrodes and membranes other factors such as losses from flushing can also influence the r value additionally the productivity of the desalination units is a metric of evaluation that is frequently determined and compared usually it is directly proportional to the size land footprint of the desalination plant and can be evaluated in a unit of the amount of clean water m3 per m2 of membrane per treatment time in ro processes the concentrate factor cf of the concentrate stream is a useful indicator to the overall concentrate salinity cf is a function of the removal ratio of salinity η and the water recovery as shown in eq 3 3 cf 1 1 r 1 r 1 η cf also represents the ratio of the concentrate salinity to the feed salinity cf increases exponentially as recovery increases when recovery increases from 70 to 90 the cf increases dramatically from 3 3 to 9 9 assumed a 99 salt removal ratio this reveals several potential issues primarily found in brackish water desalination using membrane processes such as i precipitation of sparingly soluble salts e g sio2 caco3 caso4 and baso4 which could cause scaling and fouling as well as ii the costs of subsequent brine disposal thus this foreshadows the need for alternative brackish water desalination processes 2 2 specific energy consumption sec of a desalination process specific energy consumption sec kwh m3 is the electrical energy used to product a unit of clean product water it is considered as the most important parameter characterizing the performance of the desalination plant the sec of a desalination process can be approximately determined via eq 4 4 s e c t o t a l e l e c t r i c i t y c o n s u m p t i o n c l e a n w a t e r p r o d u c t i o n the total electricity consumption of a desalination process could be attributed to the use of high pressure pumps for ro the use of external electrical energy for cdi and the water pumps for cdi for cyclical operations of most cdi units the desorption discharge step should be taken into consideration when calculating sec as shown in eq 5 5 s e c 0 t t o t i v d t q i t c r where v is the applied voltage e g the range of voltage in the desorption process for cdi i is the current t tot is the total operation time including adsorption and desorption time and t c is the treatment time e g adsorption time in the charging phase for cdi hawks et al 2019 have proposed a framework for systematically quantifying the performance of cdi in terms of sec and throughput productivity when evaluating different desalination facilities e g ro and cdi the use of throughput productivity instead of an average removal rate such as average salt adsorption rate asar is much meaningful 2 3 operation and maintenance o m costs total costs for producing clean water include capital e g installed process equipment civil works buildings operation e g energy and chemicals maintenance e g membrane and electrode replacement labor and miscellaneous e g insurance interest and project management operations of the various parts of a desalination plant including i the feed water intake ii pretreatment iii the main desalination unit iv post treatment of clean water and v brine disposal facility would contribute to the total costs of a desalination plant the operation and maintenance costs c o m are running expenses and largely depend on the design of the main desalination unit which can be calculated by eq 6 6 c o m c e n c c c c m e m where c en c cc and c mem are the costs of electrical energy denoted as the water cost in this paper chemical cleaning and membrane replacement respectively the cost of electrical energy can fluctuate and become complex since the price of electricity normally changes from year to year additionally electrical energy tariffs can lead to sharp increases in operation costs maintenance costs are generally associated with membranes and membrane related materials if membrane replacement is periodically carried out the costs of personnel chemicals e g antiscalants cartridge filter will be fairly constant over the years ruiz garcía and ruiz saavedra 2015 it is noteworthy that we use the term water costs in this paper to express only the operation costs due to the use of electrical energy such as pumps and external power 2 4 environmental impacts and carbon footprints the environmental impacts and carbon footprints of a desalination plant can be determined by conducting life cycle assessment lca lca determines the environmental impacts of a product or a technology throughout the entire life cycle i e from the design materials extraction manufacture distribution use and final disposal end of life as suggested by iso 14040 14044 international organization for standardization 2006a b lca includes four steps viz goal and scope definition data inventory life cycle impact assessment and interpretation fig 1 illustrates the assessment of environmental impacts and carbon footprints for a desalination plant the scope for lca could be generally cradle to gate cradle to grave or cradle to cradle lior 2017 where cradle gate and grave usually represent creation resource extraction factory gate and disposal phase respectively in this stage the functional unit of a desalination plant also should be clearly defined typically one m3 of freshwater produced from the plant for the stage of data inventory all inputs e g energy and chemical uses and outputs e g freshwater brine and other pollutants within the scope of lca should be quantified with a sound data inventory the environmental impacts of a desalination facility can be determined by various types of methodologies e g recipe goedkoop et al 2009 for a desalination facility the energy intensity or carbon footprint categorized as global warming potential in lca is extremely important to address the water energy nexus other key environmental impact categories include land occupation so called land footprint natural resources depletion resource footprint and ecosystem quality ecological footprint to the best of our knowledge the environmental and or ecological impacts determined from lca have been combined with different methods such as techno economic analysis kim et al 2018 and exergy analysis blanco marigorta et al 2014 to provide an insight of system optimization for desalination systems 2 5 summary the specific energy consumption of processes directly determines the operation costs while the water recovery ratio and the productivity of clean water are largely related to the post treatment cost of the brine stream and the land costs land footprint respectively the determination of key performance indicators for the cost effectiveness of ro and cdi should be based on the same removal ratio of salinity for instance in the case of a feed salinity of 5 0 g l brackish water a removal ratio of salinity above 90 is required to meet the standard of clean water for human consumption salinity 0 5 g l australian government 2004 for other purposes the salinity for treatment to the irrigation water standard should below 0 9 g l drewes et al 2009 in other words comparison between ro and cdi must be based on the feed salinity removal ratio throughput productivity and water recovery ratio 3 performance evaluation of ro for brackish water desalination ro typically operates using multiple stages the concentrate of one is the feed of the next or passes the permeate of one is the feed of the next in series the system design of brackish water reverse osmosis bwro is conceptually different from that of seawater reverse osmosis swro bwro usually operates using multiple stages blair et al 2017 wei et al 2017 while swro using multiple passes greenlee et al 2009 the choice of the number of passes or stages depends on several parameters such as feed water quality energy cost and desired recovery ratio typically a two stage configuration is used for bwro to achieve high recovery ratios with substantial energy savings the water recovery of each stage in bwro is above 50 thereby leading to an overall water recovery of over 70 greenlee et al 2009 in this part we compile the recent advances of ro processes for brackish water desalination 3 1 effect of membranes and configurations on desalination performance membranes are responsible for rejecting inorganic components from feed stream to another compartment table s1 see the supplementary information presents the characteristics and operating conditions range of different membranes for bwro thin film composite membranes using aromatic polyamide as selective layer are the most prevalent membranes in commercial ro plants due to their high salt rejection water permeability and chemical thermal mechanical biological stability as well as their wide operation temperature and ph ranges asadollahi et al 2017 provided a comprehensive review on the performance of commercial polyamide thin film composite ro membranes and then evaluated the effect of membrane fouling and chlorine attack on their performance commercial polyamide thin film composite membranes exhibit water permeability around 0 001 0 004 m3 m 2 bar 1 h 1 at salt rejections of 98 0 99 5 for brackish water feed a salinity of 2 0 g l similarly otitoju et al 2018 conducted an overview on the technology progress of interfacial polymerization and surface modification for ro membranes they pointed out that the structure property relationships and kinetic performance of composite membranes should be future research directions to explore broader niche applications recently various types of new generation membranes for desalination such as nanocomposite kurth et al 2014 cellulose nanocrystals asempour et al 2018 aquaporin wang et al 2012 nanotube yang et al 2013 and graphene based cheng et al 2016 joshi et al 2014 membranes have been developed these innovative ro membranes can generally provide beneficial advances including i low fouling ii enhanced boron rejection iii improved thermal stability and mechanical properties and iv inorganic organic nanocomposites with purported higher permeability alvarez et al 2018 amy et al 2017 otitoju et al 2018 in ro processes the production capacity i e permeate flux and water recovery is highly dependent on the control of membrane fouling despite the rapid development of core membrane technology and innovative system design membrane scaling and fouling still inhibit ro to achieve high recovery greater than 95 greenlee et al 2009 to effectively control membrane fouling several good engineering practices on feedwater properties should be followed including perhaps most importantly keeping the turbidity of feed less than 0 2 ntu wilf and bartels 2006 to provide effective biofouling control in ro desalination al abri et al 2019 also analyzed the feasibility of alternatives to chlorination such as ozone ultraviolet and nano photocatalytic materials these alternatives could effectively mitigate the degradation of ro membranes due to the attack by chlorines especially for the ozone the ph of the solution should be carefully controlled as the self decay rate of ozone is relatively low at the acidic condition which might attack the ro membrane an alternative to increasing the overall water recovery is to pretreat the feed stream e g through compact accelerated precipitation softening oren et al 2001 or treat the concentrated brine qu et al 2009 with these side treatment units the overall water recovery of bwro theoretically could increase to 93 98 gabelich et al 2007 mccool et al 2013 however additional pretreatment or post treatment processes will increase the overall energy consumption qiblawey et al 2011 found that the introduction of a softener as a pretreatment prior to the primary bwro unit increases the energy consumption from 1 9 to 13 8 kwh m3 illustrating the delicate balance between water recovery and energy consumption in bwro 3 2 energy consumption and throughput table 1 compiles the technology information of bwro plants around the world pertaining to the operation capacity water recovery energy consumption and costs bwro has been practiced at large scales for decades at numerous countries such as israel spain tunisia the us and the uk the typical energy intensity of bwro processes is approximately 0 8 2 5 kwh m3 as shown in fig 2 depending on the salinity of feedwater and effluent requirement the primary energy use in bwro is for the initial pressurization pumping of the feed which is relevant to the desired pressure and flow rate karabelas et al 2018 found that the incorporation of energy recovery device erd could further lead to achievable energy consumption as low as 0 4 0 7 kwh m3 for bwro the use of erd can effectively reduce the sec and thus the operating cost for desalination in general erd utilizes and converts the remaining pressure of the brine into the forms of mechanical energy via either turbine systems or pressure exchanges the efficiencies of energy recovery for turbine systems and pressure exchanges are typically 90 aljundi 2009 and 96 98 fritzmann et al 2007 respectively alghoul et al 2009 observed that a small scale ro without erd would consume 2 3 times more energy compared to that with erd kim et al 2019 also conducted a critical review on the performance of erd and found that the pressure exchanger should be the most efficient erd with a reported efficiency of over 95 in addition to erd numerous studies had been conducted to evaluate the feasibility and stability of renewable energy assisted e g pv powered bwro systems especially in remote areas kumar and pan 2020 the durability of renewable energy assisted systems to supply the load without any significant disturbances has been demonstrated in many places such as pv powered ro in malaysia alghoul et al 2016 khan et al 2018 also critically reviewed the current status of renewable energy assisted systems and evaluated the effect of energy supply profiles on the economics of ro plants the analyses indicated that the water costs of pv powered and wind powered bwro systems were approximately 0 9 8 5 with water production capacities of 1 2000 m3 d and 0 7 1 7 with capacities of 22 3720 m3 d usd m3 respectively therefore bwro should play an important role in water reclamation from brackish water for inland cities or rural regions system capacities for bwro range from less than 0 4 m3 per d for prototype units and up to 700 000 m3 per d for full scale plants ro recovery varies from 35 to 85 depending on feedwater properties type of pretreatment and post treatment and concentrated brine disposal options the water recovery throughput directly affects the size of plants and the operating costs energy consumption as well as the costs of brine treatment sarai atab et al 2018 found that the production cost would linearly increase with the increase of feed salinity ranging from 8000 to 14 000 mg l the concentration of rejected brine from swro also increases with the increase of feed salinity as well as applied pressure and feedwater temperature sarai atab et al 2018 3 3 costs estimation for bwro plants both the production capacity and the energy source play major roles in the cost of produced water usd m3 in this section we compile the recent advances on the cost estimation for a bwro plant in terms of plant sizes energy sources membrane replacement and total costs 3 3 1 plant sizes table 2 presents the water production cost of the main bwro processes in terms of plant sizes according to a survey of six bwro plants in texas 4500 104 000 m3 d the total production cost of water ranges between 0 29 and 0 63 usd m3 product with approximately 40 70 of costs attributed to o m arroyo and shirazi 2012 for a smaller size bwro plant the costs of water with a plant capacity of 20 1200 m3 d range from 0 78 to 1 33 usd m3 while that for a plant capacity less than 20 m3 d are even higher than 5 66 usd m3 karagiannis and soldatos 2008 in the case of a plant capacity of 30 100 m3 d the o m costs are contributed to about 60 93 in the entire costs jaber and ahmed 2004 3 3 2 energy sources in additional to fossil fuel based electricity the supply of energy for bwro desalination can come from various sources such as solar wind geothermal and ocean energy ghermandi and messalem 2009 critically evaluated a total of 79 solar powered bwro desalination units worldwide they found that the water costs of pv powered bwro systems with erds were in the range of 2 3 35 9 usd m3 while the costs of hybrid solar with fuel or wind power systems were in the range of 0 9 31 8 usd m3 ghermandi and messalem 2009 the hybrid solar systems were beneficial for bwro since the complementary aspects of two energy sources could be exploited moreover instead of using batteries higher costs with pv to drive swro it is recommended to implement battery less pv systems such as direct connection of pv dc motor using supercapacitor as electrical regulator or using controlled dc dc converter shalaby 2017 3 3 3 membrane replacement the operating costs of ro will increase due to the frequent replacement of the membranes in general mccool et al 2013 suggested the average life time of 3 and 10 years for ro and mf elements respectively table 3 compares the membrane lifespan and replacement costs of different ro processes for brackish water desalination shaaban and yahya 2017 found that the permeate flux of brackish water membranes are more affected by the temperature of feedwater rather than the feed pressure and concentration for bwro drewes et al 2009 assumed a 7 year membrane lifetime and suggested that the cost of membrane replacement should be in the range of 0 012 0 015 usd m3 similarly greenlee et al 2009 suggested a membrane replacement rate of 5 per year every 5 7 years with the permeate flux of 12 45 l per m2 per h i e hydrostatic pressure of 600 3000 kpa at a water recovery of 75 90 pretreatment of feedwater by low pressure membrane filtration e g ultrafiltration could reduce the long term costs since it would increase the lifespan of the ro membrane by 20 30 jamaly et al 2014 pearce 2008 found that using the filtration processes as a pretreatment the cleaning frequency would be reduced to twice or even once per year similarly ruiz garcía et al 2018 highlighted that with an appropriate conventional pretreatment it could preserve bwro membrane e g bw30 400 elements in service for up to 11 years in their another study ruiz garcía and ruiz saavedra 2015 they found that the most cost effective scenario should be the operation for the first ten years without replacing membranes even considering new generation membranes e g eco 440i dow however in this case the chemical cleaning would be more often after approximately 70 000 h of operation 3 3 4 total costs in the above sections we provide the information on costs estimation of bwro plants in terms of plant sizes potential energy sources and membrane replacement here we compile the total plant costs for bwro plants table 4 normally the water cost of bwro should be generally less than that of swro even though the treatment capacity in the bwro plant is significantly lower than that in swro almulla et al 2003 3 4 carbon footprint and life cycle environmental impacts the variability in life cycle stages considered and methodology as well as the location and operational parameters of ro plants would result in a significant range of carbon footprint table 5 presents the carbon footprint of bwro plants according to the analyses from recent studies cornejo et al 2014 conducted an overview on carbon footprint of desalination technologies and they found that the bwro plants 0 4 2 5 kg co2 eq m3 generally have a lower carbon footprint than swro plants 0 4 6 7 kg co2 eq m3 similar analysis by lca also indicated that the carbon footprint of bwro plants 0 84 1 60 kg co2 eq m3 is lower than that of swro plants 1 54 2 81 kg co2 eq m3 muñoz and fernández alba 2008 zhou et al 2011 examined the life cycle environmental impacts of desalination for high salinity brackish water 15 g l with a plant capacity of 10 000 m3 d and an average electricity consumption of 2 0 kwh m3 from different approaches of impact assessment characterization the considered life cycle stages included the infrastructure e g construction and land preparation operational e g chemicals membranes and electricity and dismantling e g used construction materials and membranes phases the system boundary of lca excludes both the pretreatment of raw water and brine treatment the results indicated that the global warming potential for producing 1 m3 of pure water was 1 58 kg co2 eq zhou et al 2011 the electricity consumption of a bwro plant is responsible for more than 90 of the contribution in environmental impact categories muñoz and fernández alba 2008 tarnacki et al 2012 therefore the types of energy sources for desalination are crucial to the environmental impacts as well as carbon footprint raluy et al 2005 noticed that the combination of bwro with renewable energies could result in a significant decrease in the airborne emissions such as co2 an average of 80 reduction and sox an average of 60 reduction similarly the global warming potential of bwro could decrease by 98 if the desalination plant is integrated with wind power instead of using electricity from the spanish grid mix tarnacki et al 2012 3 5 summary bwro is a mature technology which has been widely deployed for decades around the world according to our analysis based on the recent literature the energy intensity of bwro processes is approximately 0 8 2 5 kwh m3 depending on the salinity of feedwater and effluent requirement a high water recovery of over 90 could be achieved by bwro the energy consumption of bwro is responsible for 90 of the contribution in life cycle environmental impacts and the primary energy use in bwro is for the initial pressurization of the feed the incorporation of energy recovery devices could further lead to achievable energy consumption as low as 0 4 0 7 kwh m3 for inland cities or rural regions bwro powered by renewable energy could provide a solution to water reclamation appropriate pretreatment of feedwater by low pressure membrane filtration could effectively increase the lifespan of the ro membrane by 20 30 and thus reduce the long term costs 4 performance evaluation of cdi for brackish water desalination cdi can be generally described as the cyclic processes of electro adsorption known as a charge stage and electro desorption known as a discharge stage using porous or high surface area electrodes through the formation of edls cdi is particularly effective for treating non traditional waters of relatively low ionic strength since it operates at ambient conditions without the needs of extensive chemicals use in this part we compile the recent advances of cdi processes for brackish water desalination 4 1 effect of electrodes and configurations on desalination performance cdi typically relies on the formation of edls to store charges onto electrodes the design synthesis and fabrication of electrode materials are the key in developing cdi processes critical reviews on fabrication jia and zhang 2016 electrosorption behavior huang et al 2017 and surface modifications ahmed and tewari 2018 of various cdi electrodes as well as their applications in capacitive technologies ratajczak et al 2019 have been published pan et al 2018a also conducted an overview of various electrode materials including activated carbon composite flow suspension electrode e g ac mno2 suspension and battery electrode na4mn9o18 for water desalination here we provide a brief summary on the performance of different carbon based electrodes in cdi from recent studies as presented in table s2 see supplementary information most of the cdi electrodes are carbon materials i e mainly composed by element carbon such as activated carbon hu et al 2018 carbon aerogel zhu et al 2018 ordered mesoporous carbon chen et al 2018 activated carbon cloth and nanotubes li and park 2018 graphene family e g graphene sponge xu et al 2015 and graphene hydrogel ma et al 2018 and carbon composite nie et al 2012 carbon electrodes are well polarizable and typically with high specific surface area however their electrical conductivity strongly depends on the thermal treatment microtexture hybridization and content of heteroatoms as presented in table s2 see supplementary information the salt adsorption capacity sac of carbon based electrodes in conventional cdi varies between 5 0 and 49 3 mg g 1 physico chemical properties of electrode materials such as specific surface area ssa mean pore diameter dp carbon graphitization degree id ig and charge transfer resistance rct play important roles in sac and capacitance especially for the application of cdi for instance previous studies have reported that a higher id ig value should be beneficial to the charge transfer in the adsorption process nie et al 2012 the rct value of electrodes reflects the fact of charge transfer in the adsorption process to determine the impedance information on carbon materials a randles circuit model roberts and slade 2010 considering rct series resistance rs warburg open diffusion resistance wo and constant phase element q1 can be applied fig 3 illustrates the performance of different carbon based electrodes in cdi in terms of sac mg g and deionization rate mg g s a larger sac of electrodes generally represents a smaller size of cdi stack land footprint as one of the key technical economic measures while a greater deionization rate implies a high productivity of clean water in fact the ragone plot sometimes can not provide a comprehensive comparison among different electrodes the sac which is highly specific to cdi systems should be corresponded to technical economic measures while the deionization rate should scale with the actual productivity l hr m2 of cdi systems hawks et al 2019 in addition to carbon based electrodes various types of cdi electrodes such as porous silicate network metke et al 2016 and battery electrodes ahn et al 2020 have been developed for instance the use of battery electrodes could significantly improve the adsorption capacity of cdi for instance the ag agcl electrodes provide an sac of up to 85 mg g 1 at a low voltage of 0 2 v ahn et al 2020 however efforts towards improving the long term stability of battery electrodes e g used in real brackish water should be emphasized design and configurations of cdi cells also play crucial roles in desalination performance aside from the conventional cdi novel architectures on cell and or electrode designs fig 4 such as wire shaped electrode cdi mubita et al 2018 membrane cdi lee et al 2006 qian et al 2015 rocking chair cdi lee et al 2018 flow electrode cdi jeon et al 2013 flow through electrode cdi suss et al 2012 flow by electrode cdi hemmatifar et al 2015 pressurized cdi caudill 2018 inverted cdi gao et al 2015 honeycomb shaped cdi cho et al 2017 and even desalination batteries generators chen et al 2017 pasta et al 2012 suss et al 2015b have been developed these novel approaches aim to provide a higher salt adsorption capacity and charge efficiency with stable cycling even avoiding separate regeneration step for instance in membrane cdi mcdi ion exchange membranes are adjacent to the surface of the electrodes in a conventional cdi cell for avoiding the co ion and ping pong effects and thus improving the charge efficiency and electrode life omosebi et al 2017 further modified mcdi cell using asymmetric electrodes that consist of a pristine anode and oxidized cathode together with a single anion exchange membrane the modified system exhibited a high salt adsorption capacity of 16 6 mg g 1 and cut nearly half the cost of conventional mcdi other novel architectures such as flow through electrode are trying to reduce hydraulic resistance by using high surface area electrodes with a hierarchical and porous structure membrane fouling by inorganic scaling organics colloids and biomass would be a challenge in membrane cdi chang et al 2002 brackish waters are known to contain numerous inorganics such as calcium carbonate and ferric ions as major contributor to scaling mossad and zou 2013 wang et al 2019b indicated that brackish water containing ferric ions would cause a significant decrease in cdi performance where fe2o3 precipitate was found to be the predominant foulants research with natural brackish waters shows mixed results for the role of organics on the performance of membrane cdi kalfa et al 2020 suss et al 2015a for instance gabelich et al 2002 found that the organic matter in river water reduced the sorption capacity of electrodes carbon aerogel electrodes zhang et al 2013 also showed similar reduction in efficiency with organic content wang et al 2019b suggested that the presence of natural organic matter would alleviate the ferric species scaling thereby decreasing the salt adsorption capacity however lee et al 2006 found no reduction in performance of membrane cdi cell over 500 desalination cycles similarly xu et al 2008a found no significant fouling over several hours of desalination of brackish water from a natural gas generation site using a carbon aerogel type cdi but the water samples had oils and grease in low concentrations kim et al 2010b indicated that brackish water containing 5 10 mg l of oils e g octane did not affect the performance of cdi therefore future research is needed to fundamentally understand the effect of chemical composition and organic material concentration hardness and other water properties on the fouling of membrane cdi available solutions to fouling in membrane cdi include pretreatment of membranes mikhaylin and bazinet 2016 suss et al 2015a and using modification methods such as powdered biologically activated carbon ng et al 2010 nanocomposites from reduced graphene oxide with tio2 catalysts zhang and jia 2015 cellulose derived graphenic nanosheets pugazhenthiran et al 2015 and starch derived porous carbon nano sheets wu et al 2017b 4 2 energy consumption and throughput both cell designs e g type of water flow and thickness of channels and pair spacers and operating conditions exhibit a remarkable effect on energy consumption and clean water throughput table 6 compiles the performance of different designs of cdi in terms of energy consumption and clean water productivity from the literature to minimize faradaic reactions cdi usually operates under a voltage lower than 1 2 v cai et al 2017 li et al 2011 the typical energy intensity of conventional cdi is approximately 0 1 1 5 kwh m3 depending on the salinity of feedwater and effluent requirement voltea b v a company based in the netherlands has successfully developed a so called capdi technology to deionize water with moderate salinity of 4 0 g l 1 for industrial and commercial applications voltea s industrial system is12 can produce purified water at a capacity of 100 l min 1 with the energy consumption of only 0 1 0 2 kwh m 3 voltea 2015 since 2009 a large scale cdi facility with a treatment capacity of 3600 m3 d 1 has been deployed by est corp china for treatment of cold rolling wastewater at a treatment cost of 0 069 usd m 3 est 2009 other novel cdi architectures such as membrane cdi mcdi and flow electrode cdi fcdi could effectively reduce the energy intensity compared to conventional cdi for mcdi when treating brackish water with a salinity of 1 10 4 65 g l 1 it required 0 17 3 45 kwh m 3 to recover 50 of the feed at a permeate salinity of 0 5 g l 1 zhao et al 2013 tan et al 2020 also evaluated the performance of pilot scale mcdi and found it required around 0 36 kwh m 3 to desalinate the brackish water with a salinity of 1 9 g l 1 down to 1 2 g l 1 at a water recovery of 49 several studies zhao et al 2013 revealed that the pumping energy in cdi mcdi is rather small to the total energy consumption ranging from 0 2 3 0 of total energy consumption the kinetics of deionization adsorption desorption are the key factors determining the energy consumption of cdi technologies alencherry et al 2017 found that increasing the electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity of electrodes significantly enhances the deionization rate and kinetics of cdi however the kinetics of electro adsorption during desalination step were found to be independent of the thickness of ac electrodes in cdi while slow desorption kinetics during regeneration were observed for thicker electrodes zornitta et al 2016 to standardize the performance metrics for cdi suss et al 2015b recommended the use of the total cycle time the duration of both charging and discharging steps for determining the deionization salt adsorption rate of the static electrode cdi inherently a two stage process in cdi the energy efficiency largely depends on the circuit resistance including electric resistance of electrode transport losses of electric charges and ionic resistance of feed streams transport losses of ionic charges qu et al 2015 found that in a cdi system the major circuit resistance should be attributed to the contact resistance between electrodes and current collectors in the case of mcdi dykstra et al 2016 found that the main resistance is from the spacer channel and the external electrical circuit rather than the electrodes in other words the thickness of carbon electrodes i e 260 μm could further increase without a significant increase of energy consumption however this practice would result in an increase in the capital cost the corresponding energy consumption was about 6 1 kj per mole of salt removed dykstra et al 2016 in addition to the system resistance the improvement of electrode materials and thus their capacitance could increase the energy efficiency of cdi however qin et al 2019 found that further increases of capacitance above 300 f g 1 may only have little gain in overall energy efficiency for instance with the significant increases of electrode capacitance from 300 to 1000 f g 1 the energy efficiency of cdi slightly increases from 3 5 to 6 2 in the case of a water flux of 10 l m 2 h 1 in particular as the water flux increases the effect of electrode capacitance on energy efficiency of cdi becomes less remarkable 4 3 costs estimation in comparison to ro cdi technologies are relatively new and the information on cost estimation for large scale operations is not widely available in this section we compile the recent advances on the costs estimation for a cdi plant in terms of energy consumption electrode membrane replacement and total costs 4 3 1 energy consumption as aforementioned the energy consumption of a cdi process depends on the circuit resistance in other words the salinity of the feedwater exhibits a significant influence on the energy consumption of cdi extensive studies have also reported that deploying an energy recovering device such as a supercapacitor chen et al 2019 and a converter battery system tan et al 2020 with cdi during regeneration could compensate the energy consumption required for desalination for instance tan et al 2020 found that incorporation of energy recovery system with membrane cdi could reduce the total energy consumption by 30 40 with a water recovery of 87 it is noted that methods to avoid polarization could effectively minimize energy losses during regeneration for instance using a long regeneration time slow discharge however this might also increase the operating cost and complexity of the cdi design for mcdi to facilitate kinetics while increasing water throughput the reverse polarity by consuming nominal energy during regeneration has been largely applied weinstein and dash 2013 4 3 2 electrodes and membranes the manufacturing cost and scalability of the electrodes are the key factors to the total costs of cdi systems tsai et al 2019 biomass such as sugar cane bagasse zornitta et al 2018 could be utilized as low cost carbon precursor for the synthesis of porous electrodes for maintenance table s4 see supplementary information presents the electrode lifespan and the associated water recovery for cdi and mcdi according to the literature the cost of carbon electrodes ranges between 4 and 50 usd per kg omosebi et al 2017 zuo et al 2008 depending on purity and sophistication caudill 2018 identified that an improvement of electrode lifespan to more than 1000 h could provide a drastic reduction on operating costs for long term operation anodic oxidation due to undesirable faradaic reactions is a critical issue since it leads to electrode deterioration and declined performance zhang et al 2018 proposed several strategies such as developing novel electrodes and deploying alternative cell configurations e g mcdi or operations to mitigate the electrode deterioration by faradaic reactions for mcdi the costs for cell replacement were the largest contributor 81 to the total o m costs while the costs for maintenance energy chemicals and wastewater treatment were all below 10 huyskens et al 2015 this was attributed to the high capital cost for mcdi cell with the assumed short cell lifetime of about 2 years especially for biomass hydrolysates applications sata 2004 for the membrane cost in practice membrane material is directly coated onto the electrodes which is much cheaper than using free standing membranes the cost of ion exchange coatings polymers can be lower than 100 usd per m2 compared to the higher costs of uf 350 usd m2 or nafion 1400 usd m2 membranes zuo et al 2008 4 3 3 total costs the major costs of a cdi stack usually involve capital electricity based operational e g pumps and external power and replacement of electrodes and membranes table 7 summarizes the cost breakdown for a cdi mcdi plant for mcdi the cell cost was found to be the largest contributor 58 of the total capital costs while the maintenance costs were typically assumed to be 5 of equipment costs huyskens et al 2015 metzger et al 2020 also reported similar findings that the costs of ion exchange membranes shared around 80 of the total capital costs for mcdi caudill 2018 successfully developed a pressurized cdi pcdi to increase the lifetime of electrodes by 87 compared to conventional non pressurized cdi if prolonging the lifetime of electrodes from 500 h to 2000 h the total o m costs would significantly reduce from 1 70 to 1 80 to 0 50 0 55 usd m3 caudill 2018 for pcdi although the electricity cost for pumps increases for the sake of maintaining an additional 60 psig the cost saving from the prolonged lifespan of electrodes far outweighs the cost incurred by the electricity cost 4 4 carbon footprint and life cycle environmental impacts only few studies on lca have been conducted to determine the life cycle environmental impacts of cdi technologies for instance yu et al 2016 determined the environmental impacts of cdi equipped with activated carbon carbon black electrodes for brackish water i e salinity of 0 584 g l desalination they found the carbon footprint of cdi was about 1 43 kg co2 eq per m3 of clean water where 56 6 of the carbon footprint was attributed to the electrode materials and the remaining 23 1 and 21 0 were from the energy consumption and chemical components respectively shiu et al 2019 evaluated the environmental impacts of different designs and scales of cdi techniques including mcdi using lca they found that material and chemical usages had the greatest overall impact 52 90 while electricity consumption exhibited a relatively lower impact as low as 9 7 also the change of cdi housing materials from aluminum plates to plastic castings could effectively decrease the overall environmental impacts a recent analysis by metzger et al 2020 estimated the amount of co2 emission for bwro and cdi based technologies they found that in the case of middle east and north africa a transition from bwro to cdi based technology would reduce approximately 130 tons of co2 emissions per day for desalinating the brackish water at a salinity of 3 0 g l 4 5 summary cdi is a relatively new technologies in the field of brackish water desalination to the best of our knowledge only a few large scale cdi plants have been reported and most available studies are conducted at a lab scale the types of electrodes and configurations play important roles in the performance of cdi according to our analysis on the recent literature the typical energy intensity of conventional cdi is approximately 0 1 1 5 kwh m3 depending on the salinity of feedwater and effluent requirement other novel cdi architectures such as mcdi and fcdi could further reduce the energy intensity of desalination compared to conventional cdi the water recovery of cdi systems is generally around 70 90 studies on the lca of brackish water desalination using cdi are still limited the results from available studies indicate that the manufacturing of the electrode materials and the use of chemicals should be the major contributor in life cycle environmental impacts 5 trade off between kinetics and energetics the importance and significance of the energy consumption energetics and productivity kinetics can be illustrated from the thermodynamic perspective pan et al 2018a the minimum energy requirement for desalination regardless of the salt removal mechanism generally increases with the water recovery ratio according to the thermodynamics a superior energetics low energy consumption results in a low operation cost however a slow kinetics low productivity would lead to a huge reactor size thereby increasing the capital and land costs thus for system optimization of brackish water desalination there should be a trade off between kinetic and energetic efficiencies fig 5 illustrates a trade off between capital costs and energy consumption at a given production rate of fresh water for practical desalination systems from the thermodynamic point of view the best design of processes for achieving the minimum costs is not necessarily the most energy efficient design systems operating with perfect energy efficiency thermodynamic reversibility represents a very slow frictionless event an ideal system thereby requiring the largest making resources i e capital costs spiegler and el sayed 2001 as the systems depart from ideality becoming irreversible the operating costs e g energy cost would gradually increase while typically leading to a significant reduction in the capital cost the total cost for producing fresh water could be minimized as there is a trade off between capital costs and energy costs in practice other design parameters such as dimension and weight should be considered to optimize the plant design miller 2003 for the configurations of ro systems lin and elimelech 2017 derived analytical expressions to quantify and optimize the average water flux kinetic efficiency and sec energetic efficiency as shown in fig 6 the o m costs especially energy consumption and membrane replacement would influence their contributions to the total cost of the plant for long term operation ro with a high water flux is not suitable because of the great potential of fouling and scaling lin and elimelech 2017 sablani et al 2001 the system configurations also exhibited significant influence on the energetics and kinetics as well as the economic costs of the auxiliary processes such as pretreatment energy recovery devices and brine treatment these auxiliary processes would in turn affect the overall techno economics of a desalination plant similarly for the cdi systems wang and lin 2018 established a systematic approach to determining the tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies see fig 7 the kinetic efficiency depends on several factors such as average salt adsorption rate for cdi thereby affecting the clean water productivity the energetic efficiency is directly related to the specific energy consumptions since the operating costs of desalination rely on both kinetic and energetic efficiencies the optimal trade off between kinetics and energetics should be located at the place where the total costs are minimized thus hemmatifar et al 2016 suggested two performance indicators i e average salt adsorption rate asar and energy normalized adsorbed salt representing energy loss per ion removed to characterize the performance of cdi in terms of clean water throughput kinetics and energy efficiency energetics these two indicators provide a powerful tool for balancing resistive and parasitic losses thereby optimizing the overall energy efficiency especially for the energetic efficiencies between ro and cdi qin et al 2019 provided an estimate of the energy consumption in brackish water desalination using mathematical models they found that cdi exhibits greater energy efficiency for a salt rejection of less than 25 with a high water recovery compared to ro however particularly at high salt rejections 50 and moderate to high brackish water salinities 2 10 g l ro is significantly more energy efficient than cdi ramachandran et al 2019a further modified the important scaling values and resistance parameters based on qin s models they found that a reasonably high salt rejection over 70 with a high water recovery of 80 could be achieved by cdi in an energy efficient manner on the same base of assumptions porada et al 2020 found that the energy consumption of mcdi would be lower than that of ro in the case of a feed salinity of 2 3 g l 40 mm at a water recovery of 93 5 a salt rejection of 80 and a total flux of clean water of 11 9 l m 2 h 1 in fact each technology has its own niche area of applications depending upon the goals objectives and targets of the treatment for instance cdi should exhibit better energetic efficiency for desalination of lower salinity brackish water i e 2 g l than ro however for the sake of high salt rejection 80 bwro has demonstrated superior long term performance with a lower capital cost qin et al 2019 if the feedwater contains silica organic matter and pathogens ro would produce an overall better water quality than cdi drewes et al 2009 6 technical economic assessment for technical economic assessment both bwro and cdi must be able to meet a certain salinity standard e g 0 5 g l for drinking water or 1 0 g l for irrigation water for water reclamation on the same basis the criteria used to assess ro and cdi for brackish water desalination include i lifetime oriented total costs ii thermodynamic energy efficiency and clean water productivity iii pretreatment for prolonging the lifetime of key components and iv post treatment for sustainable brine management in this part we discuss the above key components for determining the technical economic performance of bwro and cdi 6 1 lifetime oriented considerations to total costs lifetime oriented considerations to total costs are crucial for the techno economic analysis of brackish water desalination a number of studies have reported the cost estimates based on parameterized process models to project fixed and variable costs at a large scale for ro and cdi bales et al 2019 hand et al 2019 metzger et al 2020 however only a few studies provided the information of total costs based on real plant operations using ro and cdi as presented in table 8 for an ro plant the capital and energy use costs per unit of capacity generally decrease as the size of the plant increases for a bwro plant the capital costs can account for about 35 42 of the total plant costs the second large cost is the energy costs which is up to 25 of the total costs other o m costs include consumable chemicals 14 membrane replacement 12 labor 5 and miscellaneous 8 similar findings were observed in the literature that the unit water price ranges between 0 10 and 1 00 usd m3 miller 2003 sethi 2007 the associated costs include capital 54 energy 11 chemicals 10 labor 9 maintenance 9 and membrane replacement 7 miller 2003 koyuncu et al 2001 suggest that membrane cost usually represents approximately 20 30 of the total capital cost for cdi the capital costs are the large portion to overall water costs accounting for 27 73 of total costs cdt inc texas usa has estimated the total costs of cdi desalination for brackish water with a salinity of 6 4 g l to meet the irrigation water standard i e 1 0 g l hand et al 2019 noticed that lifetime should be the primary factors of water costs for cdi and membrane cdi due to the relatively high portions of capital costs to total costs and it would be more pronounced at a greater reduction in salinity between feed and effluent water for instance for improving the lifetime of cdi from 2 to 5 years the reduction in water costs at 1 46 and 2 92 g l would be 0 07 and 0 17 usd m3 respectively based on a parameterized process model in other words prolonging the lifetimes of cdi systems at more than 2 years would be crucial to realize the cost effectiveness of brackish water desalination similarly drewes et al 2009 suggested that the total costs of desalination using cdi was in the range of 1 93 2 60 usd m3 depending upon the operating flow rate from 0 7 to 3 0 l min per module if the module lifetime is assumed to extend up to 20 years the total cost of desalination would be reduced to 1 76 1 97 usd m3 under the same range of flow rate drewes et al 2009 est water china also deployed several large scale cdi plants in mainland china for desalinating various types of produced water the estimated costs for energy consumption and module maintenance were 0 055 usd m3 and 0 014 usd m3 respectively est 2009 improved engineering design such as less pretreatment efficient desalination unit and effective brine management is the key to lower overall desalination costs bwro requires more professional staff for operating high pressure pumps heaters and clean in place systems while cdi usually operates at ambient pressure and temperature in the case of bwro anqi et al 2015 have conducted numerical simulations to evaluate the desalination performance they found that the sherwood number is strongly dependent on the reynolds number as well as the configurations of spacers especially for local sherwood number in other words both the pressure drops and the arrangement e g spacing of turbulators should be optimized for a given range of reynolds numbers 6 2 energy efficiency and clean water productivity in response to the water and energy nexus under global climate change a major reconsideration of desalination technologies regarding the energy efficiency and the impact of the concentrated brine on the discharge environment has occurred in fact thermodynamic energy efficiency could help us to understand the limit for further improvement on specific energy consumption among different desalination technologies wang et al 2019a also suggested to consider both thermodynamic energy efficiency and specific energy consumption when comparing different desalination systems and processes from the thermodynamic point of view cdi is more energy efficient for brackish water desalination compared to ro however the total energy consumption of the current ro system mostly on a plant scale cannot usefully be compared to the cdi values which are often at the lab scale as cdi technologies are relatively new compared to ro the currently available data of energy consumption from large scale cdi operations is similar to that of ro the improvements of both ro membranes and energy recovery devices have made significant breakthrough on the energy consumption of bwro being close to the thermodynamic limits in contrast the electrode materials and cell design of cdi are still under extensive research resulting in improved cdi performance with each novel material conversely high energy consumption of cdi is largely due to application of high currents however larger treatment capacities will overcome this limitation to achieve an industrial scale operation cdi technologies should balance the capital cost the number of modules and the energy cost the effective area of electrodes hand et al 2019 found that energy consumption is not very relevant for cdi which can be a small fraction of total costs especially for membrane cdi aside from energy efficiency the water productivity and recovery ratio are essential to overall water costs as they are associated with the subsequent brine management regardless the mechanisms of desalination various quantities of brine the concentrate stream would be produced from processes as a by product for the same treatment capacity the desalination plant with a lower recovery ratio will generate a greater amount of concentrate brine the quality and quantity of the brine would determine the optimum approach to subsequent management and utilization drewes et al 2009 found that the salinity of brine from ro 20 22 g l was much higher than that from cdi 7 8 g l according to the data from large scale operation the quantity of brine from ro was ten times less than that from cdi drewes et al 2009 this was attributed to the large amount of water for electrode regeneration and rinsing in cdi due to the slow electro desorption kinetics recently the significant improvement on water recovery of cdi has been achieved ramachandran et al 2019b developed a new scheme based on variable flowrate operation to increase water recovery for cdi with a minimal additional cost they successfully demonstrated a high water recovery ratio of 90 while improving thermodynamic efficiency by at least 2 fold this would produce a significant less volume of brine solution compared to conventional constant flowrate operation for flow electrode cdi ma et al 2019 achieved an extreme water recovery of 95 99 with the brine concentration of 20 50 g l though the charge efficiency is compromised 6 3 pretreatment for prolonging life time of key components dynamics of feedwater characteristics e g salinity and temperature must be considered in designing a brackish water desalination system for instance temperature variance may result in membrane scaling especially when the concentrations of silica and bicarbonate in the feedwater are high alghoul et al 2009 the fouling and scaling would be potential issues to membrane operations in bwro while conventional cdi has relatively less issues with fouling and scaling for membrane cdi scaling and fouling would still be a challenge chang et al 2002 bwro systems typically require pretreatment to prevent membrane scaling and fouling including ph adjustment dosing system of antiscalants and disinfectants optional and microfiltration cdi systems need a cartridge filtration as the pretreatment and might require additional pre treatment to remove organic matter a number of studies have reported that the content of organic matter would reduce the sorption capacity of cdi electrodes by fouling gabelich et al 2002 zhang et al 2013 or ferric species scaling wang et al 2019b surface modification on cdi electrodes might be potential solutions to improve the resistance of cdi systems against fouling and scaling pugazhenthiran et al 2015 wu et al 2017b zhang and jia 2015 for energy efficient ro optimization a specific concentration limit on the product stream must be adhered while applying suitable feed pressure to minimize spatial variance in flux wei et al 2017 the life span of an ro membrane increases by using a low feed pressure however this results in compromising water recovery ratios the key components affecting the desalination performance of ro or cdi include membranes and electrodes the life cycle of an ro plant is approximately 20 years where the major maintenance is membrane replacement at about every 5 7 years however both membrane and electrode lifetime could be significantly shortened by severe fouling due to improper pretreatment of feedwater for membranes manufacturers will normally provide detailed instructions for standard operation and maintenance procedures of their membrane products proper pretreatment of feedwater and periodical membrane cleaning are required to maximize the efficiency of desalination and ensure the life time of membranes asadollahi et al 2017 avlonitis et al 2003 for life time of electrodes in cdi welgemoed and schutte 2005 estimated that electrodes could last for 10 years in the case of carbon aerogel electrodes wang et al 2019b also suggested that the foulant caused by ferric ions e g fe2o3 were irreversible once formed on the electrodes which could be difficult to be entirely removed by backwash the necessary and extent of pretreatment relies on the quality of feedwater the plant location and the intake system however one of the challenges in leveraging brackish water is the dynamics of feedwater quality surface water such as seawater and wastewater typically contains readily available nutrients natural organic matter and oxygen for bio respiration therefore when surface water is involved pretreatment is essential to ensure separation efficiency and avoid biological fouling and scaling due to the presence of multiple ions such as carbonates and sulfates barium magnesium and calcium for membrane technologies conventional pretreatment typically for ro processes includes chemicals addition chemical pretreatment and generally contains flocculation sedimentation and filtration physical pretreatment to mechanically remove algae colloids and particles other pretreatments include ultrafiltration uf gao et al 2016 cartridge filtration farhat et al 2020 microfiltration wu et al 2017a forward osmosis khanzada et al 2017 and dissolved air flotation henthorne and boysen 2015 these alternatives are also considered as effective approaches to reducing membrane fouling potential and cleaning frequencies table 9 presents the costs of various pretreatment methods for ro and cdi plants according to the site measurements the conventional pretreatment can achieve a water recovery of 99 with the electricity consumption as low as 0 025 kwh per m3 of feedwater vince et al 2008 the reported costs of conventional pretreatment were approximately 0 13 usd m3 pearce 2008 however the conventional pretreatment is chemicals labor intensive and space consuming van hoof et al 2001 the land footprint of conventional pretreatment is approximately 35 40 m2 per 1000 m3 permeate per day wilf 2004 in contrast the land footprint for uf pretreatment is only 30 60 of conventional pretreatment wolf and siverns 2004 the reported uf treatment costs vary from 0 21 usd m3 to 0 52 usd m3 glueckstern and priel 2003 jurenka et al 2001 on the other hand the typical lifetime of media filter and uf membranes is 20 30 and 5 10 years respectively wolf and siverns 2004 thus there is an optimal choice of technology to use for pretreatment based on operating costs and lifetime for the media filtration the reported costs were approximately 0 51 usd m3 glueckstern and priel 2003 which was similar to that of uf pretreatment for cdi a number of studies have indicated that cdi needs only simple pretreatment such as cartridge filtration xu et al 2008b the reported o m costs for cartridge filtration were approximately 0 015 0 021 usd m3 farhat et al 2020 the low micron range cartridge filtration could be utilized for ro plants as a protection for the subsequent high pressure pumps 6 4 post treatment options for sustainable brine management for both bwro and cdi post treatment could represent a significant portion of the total water production costs as these two technologies will generate a high concentration brine metzger et al 2020 also highlighted that the brine generated from desalination facilities would pose severe environmental impacts and becomes an increasing economic concern there are different options for the disposal or treatment of brine from a desalination plant the costs of concentrated brine disposal the selection of brine disposal methods represents a compromise between technology availability total cost local resources and environmental impacts table 10 compiles the costs of various concentrated brine disposal methods surface water i e ocean river lake and lagoon discharge is the most common management practice since it is the least expensive option among other available brine disposals however it is often limited to coastal desalination plants it may also change the salinity of the receiving water depending upon water recovery and concentrate factor thereby changing the water chemistry e g dissolved gases and lack of oxygen and affecting aquatic animals several studies purnama et al 2005 smith et al 2007 showed that an increase in costal desalination installations at the arabian gulf would increase the salinity in the gulf leading to local variations in dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature therefore for surface water discharge mickley 2004 suggested a standard limit of the salinity difference between the concentrate stream and receiving water less than 10 if the feed of brackish water desalination is groundwater the concentrate brine must be treated before disposal since it typically contains high concentrations of gases such as co2 ammonia and h2s these dissolved gases are harmful and toxic to aquatic life besides surface water disposal combined sewer disposal if available is usually the next option as a relatively low cost disposal method huyskens et al 2015 reported the costs of brine disposal in wastewater treatment plants at about 1 26 usd m3 beside further treatment the brine reject can be directly utilized via various approaches e g mixed with raw water to provide the use of irrigation purposes peñate et al 2014 also salinity gradient energy so called blue energy in brine could be harvested by various promising technologies such as pressure retarded osmosis benjamin et al 2020 reverse electrodialysis nam et al 2019 capacitive mixing simoncelli et al 2018 and 2d nanopore diffusio osmosis siria et al 2017 6 5 summary the total costs of a desalination plant for producing clean water include capital o m labor and miscellaneous costs other important adjunct units to desalination such as pretreatment post treatment brine discharge and waste management also should be considered in the total costs these costs largely depend on local conditions such as the method of desalination source water quality clean water productivity capacity and availability of concentrate disposal sites in fact it is difficult to comprehensively compare the total costs of bwro and cdi as at the same removal ratio the water recovery ratios of bwro and cdi are quite different as we discussed lifetime oriented considerations including pretreatment of feedwater desalination facilities and post treatment to total costs are important for the techno economic analysis of brackish water desalination in general for ro the major cost components include capital costs of modules and energy consumption due to high pressure pumps for cdi the major cost components include the capital costs of modules and electrode replacement ro needs periodical membrane cleaning to control fouling and scaling while cdi uses electrochemical reactions or electrostatics to regenerate the saturated or fouled electrodes thus the cost for chemicals use in ro for membrane regeneration would be generally higher than that in cdi and the cost for electrode regeneration in cdi is embedded in the cost of its energy consumption in addition the quality and quantity of the brine solution generated from bwro and cdi are quite different therefore the costs of brine management would be the major concern when evaluating the total costs of brackish water desalination 7 perspectives prospects and priority research directions cdi has shown better energy efficiency for desalination of lower salinity brackish water i e 2 g l than ro however for the sake of high salt rejection 80 ro has demonstrated superior long term performance with a lower capital cost qin et al 2019 ro also can produce an overall better water quality than cdi as ro is effective to remove silica organic matter and pathogens drewes et al 2009 because of these special pros and cons we believe that each technology has its own niche area of applications depending upon the goals objectives and targets of the treatment in this part we suggest three prior research directions from the aspects of i more cost effective desalination ii high selectivity and iii sustainable brine management to optimize the desalination of brackish water and address the challenges and opportunities in water and energy nexus 7 1 hybridization for energy efficient brackish water desalination ro is the most commonly used technology since it can tackle the entire range of saline waters up to seawater although it is not energy efficient at a low salinity 3 g l tds from the thermodynamic point of view cdi or other electrokinetically driven techniques such as electrodialysis reversal liu and wang 2017 and electrodeionization pan et al 2018b should be energetically more efficient for brackish water desalination compared to pressure or thermally driven techniques although we focused on only cdi in this review each desalination technology should exhibit its own best operation with the highest energy efficiency at a certain range of feedwater quality therefore hybridization could provide the synergetic solution to energy efficient and fit for purpose water for developing a sustainable water supply especially for brackish water reuse for instance sarai atab et al 2018 analyzed the hybridization of ro with an adsorption cycle for providing large quantities of water for irrigation 24 000 m3 d and high quality water for domestic use the proposed hybrid plant has the minimum specific energy about 0 8 kwh m3 at ro recovery of 45 with a production cost of 0 56 usd m3 sarai atab et al 2018 however compared to existing municipal water sources desalinated water still comes at substantially higher costs carter 2015 the choice of desalination mechanisms techniques and their configurations depend on numerous factors such as the quality of the feed targeted quality and productivity of reclaimed water and options for brine disposal these factors sometimes are related to the local regulatory standards and requirements for identifying the best available design and operation strategies li and noh 2012 suggested that a relationship between water recovery and membrane lifetime especially for bwro should be established to incorporate capital and operating costs along with the system optimization in the future the hybridization of different separation technologies incorporated with renewable energy for energy efficient brackish water desalination should be evaluated in addition to hybridization for energy efficient brackish water desalination the development of district water e g desalination and energy e g renewables supply center provides great opportunities for advancing overall energy and water efficiency inland brackish water desalination can be coupled with renewable energy to augment freshwater supply sustainably especially at remote areas that lack access to a reliable electricity grid production of clean water also could be considered as an option of energy storage for intermittent renewables therefore the design of desalination plants should be considered along with the planning procedure of district energy supply system for supporting ancillary services in wholesale energy markets this could ensure the security and sustainability of water and energy supply several field tests have been conducted to demonstrate its feasibility and reliability such as solar photovoltaic electricity at pakistan khanzada et al 2017 and malaysia alghoul et al 2016 kim et al 2016 also conducted a dynamic performance analysis to evaluate the feasibility of integrated hybrid energy systems with ro desalination plants and identify its dynamic characteristics similar to ro the energy demands of cdi can be met by renewable energy sources such as solar pv coupling a cdi unit with pv makes the water desalination system self sufficient in energy demands and could be deployed in remote off grid locations mehrabian nejad et al 2017 distributed modular cdi have been combined with solar cell modules in recent reported research tan et al 2018 wu et al 2017b adequate infrastructure is essential to address long term water and energy scarcity challenges centralized desalination plants are usually practiced in larger scales including urban areas and cities while decentralized plants are employed for rural or remote regions that lack access to centralized systems silva herran and nakata 2012 vakilifard et al 2018 examined the role of water energy nexus in optimizing water supply systems and they found that there is a research need in the optimization of the decentralized water energy supply system independently or as an integral part of a centralized system in urban areas in addition to the optimization of water supply systems the research efforts covering instrumentation control and automation ica of energy efficient water technologies for brackish water desalination systems should be addressed in the context of future smart cities 7 2 co removal of specific components in brackish water development of scalable affordable and robust cdi electrodes with a high ion adsorption capacity can facilitate the deployment of desalination for widely available brackish water sources although cdi is effective to remove salts from water a comprehensive study on electrosorption of competing ions in brackish water is needed to understand the behavior of cdi electrodes huang et al 2017 strongly recommended applying a three electrode cell for examining the electrosorption behaviors of carbon materials in practice brackish water may contain various contaminant ions such as arsenic fluoride boron phosphate lithium iodide copper cadmium ferric and nitrate ions some of the above mentioned ions in brackish water are classified as precious metals e g lithium which could be further precisely separated and recovered by electrokinetic methods on the other hand more regulations on effluent water quality have resulted in that boron and arsenic are becoming of main interests since they are typically difficult to remove by ro despite the recent advances of membranes boron br and arsenic as rejection remains low in comparison to other inorganic components such as sodium chloride teychene et al 2013 in addition to removal of inorganic ions co removal of organic matter in brackish water has been the focus of intense scientific and practical efforts for instance lester et al 2020 developed a novel configuration of cdi with activated carbon electrodes to remove both salt and trace organic hydrophobic compounds such as bisphenol a and estrone from wastewater to maximize the removal of other compounds of interest plant design e g membrane selection and optimization warrant significant attention technological improvement and breakthrough for both membranes and electrodes could enhance economical separations to drive market penetration for brackish water desalination a number of studies have suggested that nanotechnology enable materials such as ion exchange membranes could facilitate the wide adoption of water desalination alabi et al 2018 mauter et al 2018 for membrane desalination effective removal of divalent cations at ultrafast water flux and low pressure operation as well as in situ regeneration for fouling and scaling control are important novel membrane materials such as graphene oxide membranes mi 2014 zheng et al 2017 have been under developed and investigated this could support the use of brackish water in cooling systems with minimal scaling and brine production future research on development of brackish water desalination also should focus on the removal of other regulated contaminants of emerging concern such as disinfection byproduct pharmaceutical and personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds 7 3 sustainable brine management with innovative utilization desalination typically generates concentrated brine that contains relatively high concentrations of salts organic matter and inorganic constituents e g boron and copper one of the critical concerns to inland brackish water desalination is concentrated brine disposal due to its potentially high costs as aforementioned if surface water disposal is used for brine treatment its environmental impacts on local water bodies also should be critically evaluated via an lca when ocean disposal of such streams or deep well injection is not available zero liquid discharge zld strategies are usually required to reduce the volume of concentrate while simultaneously removing contaminants from the brine zld typically involves thermally drying of concentrated brine such as thermal concentrate crystallization choi et al 2018 and capillary crystallization abahusayn 2011 sobhani et al 2012 which are deployed at high energy and capital costs gray et al 2011 therefore there is still an urgent need for innovative brine management and utilization to allow economic use of inland brackish water resources for instance engineered natural systems via biological approaches might become an alternative to manage the concentrated brine as well as to handle the issues of organics nitrate and other contaminants similarly when low grade heat such as residual heat from power plants or geothermal energy is nearby accessible membrane distillation could be deployed to increase water recovery prior to brine crystallizer deshmukh et al 2018 these innovative approaches of brine utilization could provide the potential to further recover nutrients minerals and energy for realizing a circular economy aside from the end of facility treatment optimization of chemicals and antiscalants dosing is of strategical importance to improve the cost of subsequent brine management sweity et al 2015 found that several antiscalants e g polyacrylate based or polyphosphonate based could significantly contribute to the biofouling of ro membranes where the biofouling enhancement potential should be critically screened along with their antiscaling activity similarly both energy efficiency related to energy consumption and clean water productivity related to water recovery are critical parameters to realize the zld of a desalination plant taking the example of bwro the achievable water recovery is typically 60 85 and thus results in a concentration factor of 2 5 6 7 however with a high water recovery of 97 the concentration factor would increase to more than 33 3 leading to relatively high costs for zld processes in other words both the energy consumption and water recovery should be practically balanced with the consideration of subsequent brine disposal to achieve an overall cost effective scenario 8 concluding remarks brackish water is an important alternative to fresh water resources potentially enabling the movement of the water energy nexus away from the seacoast further inland technology maturity determines the extent of practical deployment ro has been fully commercialized for decades whereas cdi has not yet achieved widespread market adoption further improvements on desalination technologies would provide significant potential to ensure the availability accessibility and affordability of fit for purpose fresh water from brackish water the quality of feedwater plays a critical role in the selection design and operation of desalination technologies because one of the challenges in exploitation of brackish water is the dynamics of feedwater quality to facilitate the exploitation of brackish water we suggest three prior research directions for the optimization of brackish water desalination while addressing the challenges and opportunities in water and energy nexus including hybridization for energy efficient brackish water desalination co removal of specific components in brackish water and sustainable brine management with innovative utilization for both bwro and cdi development of sustainable brine management with innovative utilization would effectively mitigate the environmental impacts and reduce the o m costs along the way achieving as high as possible on water recovery would directly decrease the amount of the brine generation from desalination facilities which would

presents the advances of brackish water desalination using reverse osmosis and capacitive deionization and associated challenges and opportunities image 1 keywords electrokinetics energy consumption water productivity brine utilization carbon footprint hybridization 1 introduction due to rapid population growth and resource depletion freshwater stress and scarcity are one of the most severe challenges around the world especially in countries such as saudi arabia aljohani 2017 jordan qasim et al 2018 and tunisia walha et al 2007 seawater a salinity 35 g l is considered an infinite water resource and seawater desalination by reverse osmosis ro using semipermeable membranes has been practiced at commercial scales for decades at numerous countries such as israel segal et al 2018 australia linge et al 2013 spain quevedo et al 2011 and the us rao et al 2018 and is believed to be the most optimized technology for seawater desalination usdoe 2014 existing seawater ro swro plants operate near the thermodynamic limit where the applied pressure is only 10 20 higher than the osmotic pressure of the concentrate elimelech and phillip 2011 the energy consumption of an industrial scale swro is typically on the order of 2 5 4 0 kwh m3 shannon et al 2008 subramani et al 2014 yangali quintanilla et al 2011 producing freshwater at an average cost of 0 5 1 2 usd m3 kim et al 2010a nanda 2018 however ro becomes less energy efficient for brackish water desalination due to the high energy consumption per ion amy et al 2017 brackish water salinity of 1 10 g l elimelech and phillip 2011 is an essential water desalination alternative when compared to seawater potentially enabling the movement of the water energy nexus away from the seacoast further inland this allows for production of clean water at lower operating cost and lower energy burden already a shift to using brackish water as the water source has been sharply increasing in water stressed regions such as egypt allam et al 2002 sources of brackish water include groundwater naturally saline aquifers rivers wastewater e g hydraulic fracturing cooling water human activities and industrial processes and irrigation return flow so far brackish water desalination represents over 21 of the total worldwide desalination capacity jones et al 2019 compared to seawater desalination most desalination plants using brackish water have much lower production capacity between 500 and 10 000 m3 per day jaber and ahmed 2004 even up to 76 000 m3 per day in the us mickley 2001 despite the relatively lower production capacity the inland brackish water desalination plants can provide a vital solution to solve the water stress and scarcity in remoted areas electrokinetic desalination technologies such as capacitive deionization cdi have attracted great attention for water reuse due to their energy efficient separation of ionized or ionizable species from solutions cdi are broadly defined as a category of ion separation technologies where electrodes are cyclically charged and discharged regardless of deionization mechanisms or electrodes biesheuvel et al 2017 it is noteworthy that non cyclical characteristics have been achieved in recent cdi design such as flow electrode cdi he et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in cdi charged ions are electrically separated through the formation of electrical double layers edls to produce fit for purpose water delgado et al 2019 pan et al 2018a as a result the energy consumption in cdi correlates with the quantity of ions removed cdi also could apply an electrical current to drive faradaic reactions such as redox cathode anode and intercalation reactions zhang et al 2018 this provides opportunities of simultaneous oxidation and separation for other contaminants in brackish water however cdi is typically not effective to remove uncharged organics and biological species which is the biggest difference to ro as climate change and population increase continue well into the 21st century water stress will continue to be a major concern and will thus drive increases in brackish water desalination technologies for brackish water desalination will consume a significant amount of energy and the energy intensity of desalination facilities will affect the cost effectiveness and environmental impacts of the plant to the best of our knowledge little to none research has been focused on addressing the water and energy nexus for brackish water desalination using ro and cdi in this article we review the recent advances of the performance of ro and cdi for brackish water desalination from the energy economic and environmental aspects we first illustrate the criteria and the key performance indicators to evaluate the performance of brackish water desalination next we systematically gather technological information of ro and cdi for brackish water desalination published in the recent years a summary on the effect of key parameters on desalination performance as well as energy water efficiency economic costs and environmental impacts are included we provide in depth discussion on the interconnectivity between desalination and energy and discuss the trade off between kinetics and energetics for ro and cdi we also compare the results of technical economic assessment for ro and cdi plants in the context of large scale deployment and discuss the engineering design construction and operation from the lifetime oriented considerations finally we illustrate the challenges and opportunities of desalination for brackish water 2 criteria and key performance indicators for brackish water desalination the performance of a desalination facility depends on the types of the applied materials e g electrodes and membranes in desalination facilities and the operating conditions e g flow rate applied current and pressure when determining the performance of a desalination facility we should establish a standard evaluation procedure that first defines feed salinity c o and required salinity removal ratio η and then measure three indicators that are largely related to the cost effectiveness of a process i specific energy consumption ii water recovery ratio and iii productivity of clean water from the processes this consideration has been critically addressed and discussed in the review paper published by hawks et al 2019 eq 1 gives the removal ratio of salinity η quantified by the fraction of ions removed through the desalination facilities 1 η c o c i c o 100 where c o and c i are the salinity g l of feed and effluent streams respectively in this part we briefly illustrate the definition of several key performance indicators including the treatment capacity water recovery specific energy consumption and operation and maintenance o m costs we also discuss the importance of the environmental impacts and carbon footprints when evaluating the performance and cost effectiveness of a desalination facility 2 1 treatment capacity and recovery treatment capacity q i and water recovery r are essential to evaluating the cost effectiveness of a desalination plant the r value of a desalination plant also directly determines the volume of the rejection brine which requires subsequent treatment and management the r value can be determined by eq 2 2 r c l e a n w a t e r p r o d u c t i o n t r e a t m e n t c a p a c i t y q o q i 100 where q i and q o are the flow rate of feed water and permeate clean water respectively the r value is dependent on the ion removal mechanisms of a desalination facility as well as the types of the applied materials e g electrodes and membranes other factors such as losses from flushing can also influence the r value additionally the productivity of the desalination units is a metric of evaluation that is frequently determined and compared usually it is directly proportional to the size land footprint of the desalination plant and can be evaluated in a unit of the amount of clean water m3 per m2 of membrane per treatment time in ro processes the concentrate factor cf of the concentrate stream is a useful indicator to the overall concentrate salinity cf is a function of the removal ratio of salinity η and the water recovery as shown in eq 3 3 cf 1 1 r 1 r 1 η cf also represents the ratio of the concentrate salinity to the feed salinity cf increases exponentially as recovery increases when recovery increases from 70 to 90 the cf increases dramatically from 3 3 to 9 9 assumed a 99 salt removal ratio this reveals several potential issues primarily found in brackish water desalination using membrane processes such as i precipitation of sparingly soluble salts e g sio2 caco3 caso4 and baso4 which could cause scaling and fouling as well as ii the costs of subsequent brine disposal thus this foreshadows the need for alternative brackish water desalination processes 2 2 specific energy consumption sec of a desalination process specific energy consumption sec kwh m3 is the electrical energy used to product a unit of clean product water it is considered as the most important parameter characterizing the performance of the desalination plant the sec of a desalination process can be approximately determined via eq 4 4 s e c t o t a l e l e c t r i c i t y c o n s u m p t i o n c l e a n w a t e r p r o d u c t i o n the total electricity consumption of a desalination process could be attributed to the use of high pressure pumps for ro the use of external electrical energy for cdi and the water pumps for cdi for cyclical operations of most cdi units the desorption discharge step should be taken into consideration when calculating sec as shown in eq 5 5 s e c 0 t t o t i v d t q i t c r where v is the applied voltage e g the range of voltage in the desorption process for cdi i is the current t tot is the total operation time including adsorption and desorption time and t c is the treatment time e g adsorption time in the charging phase for cdi hawks et al 2019 have proposed a framework for systematically quantifying the performance of cdi in terms of sec and throughput productivity when evaluating different desalination facilities e g ro and cdi the use of throughput productivity instead of an average removal rate such as average salt adsorption rate asar is much meaningful 2 3 operation and maintenance o m costs total costs for producing clean water include capital e g installed process equipment civil works buildings operation e g energy and chemicals maintenance e g membrane and electrode replacement labor and miscellaneous e g insurance interest and project management operations of the various parts of a desalination plant including i the feed water intake ii pretreatment iii the main desalination unit iv post treatment of clean water and v brine disposal facility would contribute to the total costs of a desalination plant the operation and maintenance costs c o m are running expenses and largely depend on the design of the main desalination unit which can be calculated by eq 6 6 c o m c e n c c c c m e m where c en c cc and c mem are the costs of electrical energy denoted as the water cost in this paper chemical cleaning and membrane replacement respectively the cost of electrical energy can fluctuate and become complex since the price of electricity normally changes from year to year additionally electrical energy tariffs can lead to sharp increases in operation costs maintenance costs are generally associated with membranes and membrane related materials if membrane replacement is periodically carried out the costs of personnel chemicals e g antiscalants cartridge filter will be fairly constant over the years ruiz garcía and ruiz saavedra 2015 it is noteworthy that we use the term water costs in this paper to express only the operation costs due to the use of electrical energy such as pumps and external power 2 4 environmental impacts and carbon footprints the environmental impacts and carbon footprints of a desalination plant can be determined by conducting life cycle assessment lca lca determines the environmental impacts of a product or a technology throughout the entire life cycle i e from the design materials extraction manufacture distribution use and final disposal end of life as suggested by iso 14040 14044 international organization for standardization 2006a b lca includes four steps viz goal and scope definition data inventory life cycle impact assessment and interpretation fig 1 illustrates the assessment of environmental impacts and carbon footprints for a desalination plant the scope for lca could be generally cradle to gate cradle to grave or cradle to cradle lior 2017 where cradle gate and grave usually represent creation resource extraction factory gate and disposal phase respectively in this stage the functional unit of a desalination plant also should be clearly defined typically one m3 of freshwater produced from the plant for the stage of data inventory all inputs e g energy and chemical uses and outputs e g freshwater brine and other pollutants within the scope of lca should be quantified with a sound data inventory the environmental impacts of a desalination facility can be determined by various types of methodologies e g recipe goedkoop et al 2009 for a desalination facility the energy intensity or carbon footprint categorized as global warming potential in lca is extremely important to address the water energy nexus other key environmental impact categories include land occupation so called land footprint natural resources depletion resource footprint and ecosystem quality ecological footprint to the best of our knowledge the environmental and or ecological impacts determined from lca have been combined with different methods such as techno economic analysis kim et al 2018 and exergy analysis blanco marigorta et al 2014 to provide an insight of system optimization for desalination systems 2 5 summary the specific energy consumption of processes directly determines the operation costs while the water recovery ratio and the productivity of clean water are largely related to the post treatment cost of the brine stream and the land costs land footprint respectively the determination of key performance indicators for the cost effectiveness of ro and cdi should be based on the same removal ratio of salinity for instance in the case of a feed salinity of 5 0 g l brackish water a removal ratio of salinity above 90 is required to meet the standard of clean water for human consumption salinity 0 5 g l australian government 2004 for other purposes the salinity for treatment to the irrigation water standard should below 0 9 g l drewes et al 2009 in other words comparison between ro and cdi must be based on the feed salinity removal ratio throughput productivity and water recovery ratio 3 performance evaluation of ro for brackish water desalination ro typically operates using multiple stages the concentrate of one is the feed of the next or passes the permeate of one is the feed of the next in series the system design of brackish water reverse osmosis bwro is conceptually different from that of seawater reverse osmosis swro bwro usually operates using multiple stages blair et al 2017 wei et al 2017 while swro using multiple passes greenlee et al 2009 the choice of the number of passes or stages depends on several parameters such as feed water quality energy cost and desired recovery ratio typically a two stage configuration is used for bwro to achieve high recovery ratios with substantial energy savings the water recovery of each stage in bwro is above 50 thereby leading to an overall water recovery of over 70 greenlee et al 2009 in this part we compile the recent advances of ro processes for brackish water desalination 3 1 effect of membranes and configurations on desalination performance membranes are responsible for rejecting inorganic components from feed stream to another compartment table s1 see the supplementary information presents the characteristics and operating conditions range of different membranes for bwro thin film composite membranes using aromatic polyamide as selective layer are the most prevalent membranes in commercial ro plants due to their high salt rejection water permeability and chemical thermal mechanical biological stability as well as their wide operation temperature and ph ranges asadollahi et al 2017 provided a comprehensive review on the performance of commercial polyamide thin film composite ro membranes and then evaluated the effect of membrane fouling and chlorine attack on their performance commercial polyamide thin film composite membranes exhibit water permeability around 0 001 0 004 m3 m 2 bar 1 h 1 at salt rejections of 98 0 99 5 for brackish water feed a salinity of 2 0 g l similarly otitoju et al 2018 conducted an overview on the technology progress of interfacial polymerization and surface modification for ro membranes they pointed out that the structure property relationships and kinetic performance of composite membranes should be future research directions to explore broader niche applications recently various types of new generation membranes for desalination such as nanocomposite kurth et al 2014 cellulose nanocrystals asempour et al 2018 aquaporin wang et al 2012 nanotube yang et al 2013 and graphene based cheng et al 2016 joshi et al 2014 membranes have been developed these innovative ro membranes can generally provide beneficial advances including i low fouling ii enhanced boron rejection iii improved thermal stability and mechanical properties and iv inorganic organic nanocomposites with purported higher permeability alvarez et al 2018 amy et al 2017 otitoju et al 2018 in ro processes the production capacity i e permeate flux and water recovery is highly dependent on the control of membrane fouling despite the rapid development of core membrane technology and innovative system design membrane scaling and fouling still inhibit ro to achieve high recovery greater than 95 greenlee et al 2009 to effectively control membrane fouling several good engineering practices on feedwater properties should be followed including perhaps most importantly keeping the turbidity of feed less than 0 2 ntu wilf and bartels 2006 to provide effective biofouling control in ro desalination al abri et al 2019 also analyzed the feasibility of alternatives to chlorination such as ozone ultraviolet and nano photocatalytic materials these alternatives could effectively mitigate the degradation of ro membranes due to the attack by chlorines especially for the ozone the ph of the solution should be carefully controlled as the self decay rate of ozone is relatively low at the acidic condition which might attack the ro membrane an alternative to increasing the overall water recovery is to pretreat the feed stream e g through compact accelerated precipitation softening oren et al 2001 or treat the concentrated brine qu et al 2009 with these side treatment units the overall water recovery of bwro theoretically could increase to 93 98 gabelich et al 2007 mccool et al 2013 however additional pretreatment or post treatment processes will increase the overall energy consumption qiblawey et al 2011 found that the introduction of a softener as a pretreatment prior to the primary bwro unit increases the energy consumption from 1 9 to 13 8 kwh m3 illustrating the delicate balance between water recovery and energy consumption in bwro 3 2 energy consumption and throughput table 1 compiles the technology information of bwro plants around the world pertaining to the operation capacity water recovery energy consumption and costs bwro has been practiced at large scales for decades at numerous countries such as israel spain tunisia the us and the uk the typical energy intensity of bwro processes is approximately 0 8 2 5 kwh m3 as shown in fig 2 depending on the salinity of feedwater and effluent requirement the primary energy use in bwro is for the initial pressurization pumping of the feed which is relevant to the desired pressure and flow rate karabelas et al 2018 found that the incorporation of energy recovery device erd could further lead to achievable energy consumption as low as 0 4 0 7 kwh m3 for bwro the use of erd can effectively reduce the sec and thus the operating cost for desalination in general erd utilizes and converts the remaining pressure of the brine into the forms of mechanical energy via either turbine systems or pressure exchanges the efficiencies of energy recovery for turbine systems and pressure exchanges are typically 90 aljundi 2009 and 96 98 fritzmann et al 2007 respectively alghoul et al 2009 observed that a small scale ro without erd would consume 2 3 times more energy compared to that with erd kim et al 2019 also conducted a critical review on the performance of erd and found that the pressure exchanger should be the most efficient erd with a reported efficiency of over 95 in addition to erd numerous studies had been conducted to evaluate the feasibility and stability of renewable energy assisted e g pv powered bwro systems especially in remote areas kumar and pan 2020 the durability of renewable energy assisted systems to supply the load without any significant disturbances has been demonstrated in many places such as pv powered ro in malaysia alghoul et al 2016 khan et al 2018 also critically reviewed the current status of renewable energy assisted systems and evaluated the effect of energy supply profiles on the economics of ro plants the analyses indicated that the water costs of pv powered and wind powered bwro systems were approximately 0 9 8 5 with water production capacities of 1 2000 m3 d and 0 7 1 7 with capacities of 22 3720 m3 d usd m3 respectively therefore bwro should play an important role in water reclamation from brackish water for inland cities or rural regions system capacities for bwro range from less than 0 4 m3 per d for prototype units and up to 700 000 m3 per d for full scale plants ro recovery varies from 35 to 85 depending on feedwater properties type of pretreatment and post treatment and concentrated brine disposal options the water recovery throughput directly affects the size of plants and the operating costs energy consumption as well as the costs of brine treatment sarai atab et al 2018 found that the production cost would linearly increase with the increase of feed salinity ranging from 8000 to 14 000 mg l the concentration of rejected brine from swro also increases with the increase of feed salinity as well as applied pressure and feedwater temperature sarai atab et al 2018 3 3 costs estimation for bwro plants both the production capacity and the energy source play major roles in the cost of produced water usd m3 in this section we compile the recent advances on the cost estimation for a bwro plant in terms of plant sizes energy sources membrane replacement and total costs 3 3 1 plant sizes table 2 presents the water production cost of the main bwro processes in terms of plant sizes according to a survey of six bwro plants in texas 4500 104 000 m3 d the total production cost of water ranges between 0 29 and 0 63 usd m3 product with approximately 40 70 of costs attributed to o m arroyo and shirazi 2012 for a smaller size bwro plant the costs of water with a plant capacity of 20 1200 m3 d range from 0 78 to 1 33 usd m3 while that for a plant capacity less than 20 m3 d are even higher than 5 66 usd m3 karagiannis and soldatos 2008 in the case of a plant capacity of 30 100 m3 d the o m costs are contributed to about 60 93 in the entire costs jaber and ahmed 2004 3 3 2 energy sources in additional to fossil fuel based electricity the supply of energy for bwro desalination can come from various sources such as solar wind geothermal and ocean energy ghermandi and messalem 2009 critically evaluated a total of 79 solar powered bwro desalination units worldwide they found that the water costs of pv powered bwro systems with erds were in the range of 2 3 35 9 usd m3 while the costs of hybrid solar with fuel or wind power systems were in the range of 0 9 31 8 usd m3 ghermandi and messalem 2009 the hybrid solar systems were beneficial for bwro since the complementary aspects of two energy sources could be exploited moreover instead of using batteries higher costs with pv to drive swro it is recommended to implement battery less pv systems such as direct connection of pv dc motor using supercapacitor as electrical regulator or using controlled dc dc converter shalaby 2017 3 3 3 membrane replacement the operating costs of ro will increase due to the frequent replacement of the membranes in general mccool et al 2013 suggested the average life time of 3 and 10 years for ro and mf elements respectively table 3 compares the membrane lifespan and replacement costs of different ro processes for brackish water desalination shaaban and yahya 2017 found that the permeate flux of brackish water membranes are more affected by the temperature of feedwater rather than the feed pressure and concentration for bwro drewes et al 2009 assumed a 7 year membrane lifetime and suggested that the cost of membrane replacement should be in the range of 0 012 0 015 usd m3 similarly greenlee et al 2009 suggested a membrane replacement rate of 5 per year every 5 7 years with the permeate flux of 12 45 l per m2 per h i e hydrostatic pressure of 600 3000 kpa at a water recovery of 75 90 pretreatment of feedwater by low pressure membrane filtration e g ultrafiltration could reduce the long term costs since it would increase the lifespan of the ro membrane by 20 30 jamaly et al 2014 pearce 2008 found that using the filtration processes as a pretreatment the cleaning frequency would be reduced to twice or even once per year similarly ruiz garcía et al 2018 highlighted that with an appropriate conventional pretreatment it could preserve bwro membrane e g bw30 400 elements in service for up to 11 years in their another study ruiz garcía and ruiz saavedra 2015 they found that the most cost effective scenario should be the operation for the first ten years without replacing membranes even considering new generation membranes e g eco 440i dow however in this case the chemical cleaning would be more often after approximately 70 000 h of operation 3 3 4 total costs in the above sections we provide the information on costs estimation of bwro plants in terms of plant sizes potential energy sources and membrane replacement here we compile the total plant costs for bwro plants table 4 normally the water cost of bwro should be generally less than that of swro even though the treatment capacity in the bwro plant is significantly lower than that in swro almulla et al 2003 3 4 carbon footprint and life cycle environmental impacts the variability in life cycle stages considered and methodology as well as the location and operational parameters of ro plants would result in a significant range of carbon footprint table 5 presents the carbon footprint of bwro plants according to the analyses from recent studies cornejo et al 2014 conducted an overview on carbon footprint of desalination technologies and they found that the bwro plants 0 4 2 5 kg co2 eq m3 generally have a lower carbon footprint than swro plants 0 4 6 7 kg co2 eq m3 similar analysis by lca also indicated that the carbon footprint of bwro plants 0 84 1 60 kg co2 eq m3 is lower than that of swro plants 1 54 2 81 kg co2 eq m3 muñoz and fernández alba 2008 zhou et al 2011 examined the life cycle environmental impacts of desalination for high salinity brackish water 15 g l with a plant capacity of 10 000 m3 d and an average electricity consumption of 2 0 kwh m3 from different approaches of impact assessment characterization the considered life cycle stages included the infrastructure e g construction and land preparation operational e g chemicals membranes and electricity and dismantling e g used construction materials and membranes phases the system boundary of lca excludes both the pretreatment of raw water and brine treatment the results indicated that the global warming potential for producing 1 m3 of pure water was 1 58 kg co2 eq zhou et al 2011 the electricity consumption of a bwro plant is responsible for more than 90 of the contribution in environmental impact categories muñoz and fernández alba 2008 tarnacki et al 2012 therefore the types of energy sources for desalination are crucial to the environmental impacts as well as carbon footprint raluy et al 2005 noticed that the combination of bwro with renewable energies could result in a significant decrease in the airborne emissions such as co2 an average of 80 reduction and sox an average of 60 reduction similarly the global warming potential of bwro could decrease by 98 if the desalination plant is integrated with wind power instead of using electricity from the spanish grid mix tarnacki et al 2012 3 5 summary bwro is a mature technology which has been widely deployed for decades around the world according to our analysis based on the recent literature the energy intensity of bwro processes is approximately 0 8 2 5 kwh m3 depending on the salinity of feedwater and effluent requirement a high water recovery of over 90 could be achieved by bwro the energy consumption of bwro is responsible for 90 of the contribution in life cycle environmental impacts and the primary energy use in bwro is for the initial pressurization of the feed the incorporation of energy recovery devices could further lead to achievable energy consumption as low as 0 4 0 7 kwh m3 for inland cities or rural regions bwro powered by renewable energy could provide a solution to water reclamation appropriate pretreatment of feedwater by low pressure membrane filtration could effectively increase the lifespan of the ro membrane by 20 30 and thus reduce the long term costs 4 performance evaluation of cdi for brackish water desalination cdi can be generally described as the cyclic processes of electro adsorption known as a charge stage and electro desorption known as a discharge stage using porous or high surface area electrodes through the formation of edls cdi is particularly effective for treating non traditional waters of relatively low ionic strength since it operates at ambient conditions without the needs of extensive chemicals use in this part we compile the recent advances of cdi processes for brackish water desalination 4 1 effect of electrodes and configurations on desalination performance cdi typically relies on the formation of edls to store charges onto electrodes the design synthesis and fabrication of electrode materials are the key in developing cdi processes critical reviews on fabrication jia and zhang 2016 electrosorption behavior huang et al 2017 and surface modifications ahmed and tewari 2018 of various cdi electrodes as well as their applications in capacitive technologies ratajczak et al 2019 have been published pan et al 2018a also conducted an overview of various electrode materials including activated carbon composite flow suspension electrode e g ac mno2 suspension and battery electrode na4mn9o18 for water desalination here we provide a brief summary on the performance of different carbon based electrodes in cdi from recent studies as presented in table s2 see supplementary information most of the cdi electrodes are carbon materials i e mainly composed by element carbon such as activated carbon hu et al 2018 carbon aerogel zhu et al 2018 ordered mesoporous carbon chen et al 2018 activated carbon cloth and nanotubes li and park 2018 graphene family e g graphene sponge xu et al 2015 and graphene hydrogel ma et al 2018 and carbon composite nie et al 2012 carbon electrodes are well polarizable and typically with high specific surface area however their electrical conductivity strongly depends on the thermal treatment microtexture hybridization and content of heteroatoms as presented in table s2 see supplementary information the salt adsorption capacity sac of carbon based electrodes in conventional cdi varies between 5 0 and 49 3 mg g 1 physico chemical properties of electrode materials such as specific surface area ssa mean pore diameter dp carbon graphitization degree id ig and charge transfer resistance rct play important roles in sac and capacitance especially for the application of cdi for instance previous studies have reported that a higher id ig value should be beneficial to the charge transfer in the adsorption process nie et al 2012 the rct value of electrodes reflects the fact of charge transfer in the adsorption process to determine the impedance information on carbon materials a randles circuit model roberts and slade 2010 considering rct series resistance rs warburg open diffusion resistance wo and constant phase element q1 can be applied fig 3 illustrates the performance of different carbon based electrodes in cdi in terms of sac mg g and deionization rate mg g s a larger sac of electrodes generally represents a smaller size of cdi stack land footprint as one of the key technical economic measures while a greater deionization rate implies a high productivity of clean water in fact the ragone plot sometimes can not provide a comprehensive comparison among different electrodes the sac which is highly specific to cdi systems should be corresponded to technical economic measures while the deionization rate should scale with the actual productivity l hr m2 of cdi systems hawks et al 2019 in addition to carbon based electrodes various types of cdi electrodes such as porous silicate network metke et al 2016 and battery electrodes ahn et al 2020 have been developed for instance the use of battery electrodes could significantly improve the adsorption capacity of cdi for instance the ag agcl electrodes provide an sac of up to 85 mg g 1 at a low voltage of 0 2 v ahn et al 2020 however efforts towards improving the long term stability of battery electrodes e g used in real brackish water should be emphasized design and configurations of cdi cells also play crucial roles in desalination performance aside from the conventional cdi novel architectures on cell and or electrode designs fig 4 such as wire shaped electrode cdi mubita et al 2018 membrane cdi lee et al 2006 qian et al 2015 rocking chair cdi lee et al 2018 flow electrode cdi jeon et al 2013 flow through electrode cdi suss et al 2012 flow by electrode cdi hemmatifar et al 2015 pressurized cdi caudill 2018 inverted cdi gao et al 2015 honeycomb shaped cdi cho et al 2017 and even desalination batteries generators chen et al 2017 pasta et al 2012 suss et al 2015b have been developed these novel approaches aim to provide a higher salt adsorption capacity and charge efficiency with stable cycling even avoiding separate regeneration step for instance in membrane cdi mcdi ion exchange membranes are adjacent to the surface of the electrodes in a conventional cdi cell for avoiding the co ion and ping pong effects and thus improving the charge efficiency and electrode life omosebi et al 2017 further modified mcdi cell using asymmetric electrodes that consist of a pristine anode and oxidized cathode together with a single anion exchange membrane the modified system exhibited a high salt adsorption capacity of 16 6 mg g 1 and cut nearly half the cost of conventional mcdi other novel architectures such as flow through electrode are trying to reduce hydraulic resistance by using high surface area electrodes with a hierarchical and porous structure membrane fouling by inorganic scaling organics colloids and biomass would be a challenge in membrane cdi chang et al 2002 brackish waters are known to contain numerous inorganics such as calcium carbonate and ferric ions as major contributor to scaling mossad and zou 2013 wang et al 2019b indicated that brackish water containing ferric ions would cause a significant decrease in cdi performance where fe2o3 precipitate was found to be the predominant foulants research with natural brackish waters shows mixed results for the role of organics on the performance of membrane cdi kalfa et al 2020 suss et al 2015a for instance gabelich et al 2002 found that the organic matter in river water reduced the sorption capacity of electrodes carbon aerogel electrodes zhang et al 2013 also showed similar reduction in efficiency with organic content wang et al 2019b suggested that the presence of natural organic matter would alleviate the ferric species scaling thereby decreasing the salt adsorption capacity however lee et al 2006 found no reduction in performance of membrane cdi cell over 500 desalination cycles similarly xu et al 2008a found no significant fouling over several hours of desalination of brackish water from a natural gas generation site using a carbon aerogel type cdi but the water samples had oils and grease in low concentrations kim et al 2010b indicated that brackish water containing 5 10 mg l of oils e g octane did not affect the performance of cdi therefore future research is needed to fundamentally understand the effect of chemical composition and organic material concentration hardness and other water properties on the fouling of membrane cdi available solutions to fouling in membrane cdi include pretreatment of membranes mikhaylin and bazinet 2016 suss et al 2015a and using modification methods such as powdered biologically activated carbon ng et al 2010 nanocomposites from reduced graphene oxide with tio2 catalysts zhang and jia 2015 cellulose derived graphenic nanosheets pugazhenthiran et al 2015 and starch derived porous carbon nano sheets wu et al 2017b 4 2 energy consumption and throughput both cell designs e g type of water flow and thickness of channels and pair spacers and operating conditions exhibit a remarkable effect on energy consumption and clean water throughput table 6 compiles the performance of different designs of cdi in terms of energy consumption and clean water productivity from the literature to minimize faradaic reactions cdi usually operates under a voltage lower than 1 2 v cai et al 2017 li et al 2011 the typical energy intensity of conventional cdi is approximately 0 1 1 5 kwh m3 depending on the salinity of feedwater and effluent requirement voltea b v a company based in the netherlands has successfully developed a so called capdi technology to deionize water with moderate salinity of 4 0 g l 1 for industrial and commercial applications voltea s industrial system is12 can produce purified water at a capacity of 100 l min 1 with the energy consumption of only 0 1 0 2 kwh m 3 voltea 2015 since 2009 a large scale cdi facility with a treatment capacity of 3600 m3 d 1 has been deployed by est corp china for treatment of cold rolling wastewater at a treatment cost of 0 069 usd m 3 est 2009 other novel cdi architectures such as membrane cdi mcdi and flow electrode cdi fcdi could effectively reduce the energy intensity compared to conventional cdi for mcdi when treating brackish water with a salinity of 1 10 4 65 g l 1 it required 0 17 3 45 kwh m 3 to recover 50 of the feed at a permeate salinity of 0 5 g l 1 zhao et al 2013 tan et al 2020 also evaluated the performance of pilot scale mcdi and found it required around 0 36 kwh m 3 to desalinate the brackish water with a salinity of 1 9 g l 1 down to 1 2 g l 1 at a water recovery of 49 several studies zhao et al 2013 revealed that the pumping energy in cdi mcdi is rather small to the total energy consumption ranging from 0 2 3 0 of total energy consumption the kinetics of deionization adsorption desorption are the key factors determining the energy consumption of cdi technologies alencherry et al 2017 found that increasing the electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity of electrodes significantly enhances the deionization rate and kinetics of cdi however the kinetics of electro adsorption during desalination step were found to be independent of the thickness of ac electrodes in cdi while slow desorption kinetics during regeneration were observed for thicker electrodes zornitta et al 2016 to standardize the performance metrics for cdi suss et al 2015b recommended the use of the total cycle time the duration of both charging and discharging steps for determining the deionization salt adsorption rate of the static electrode cdi inherently a two stage process in cdi the energy efficiency largely depends on the circuit resistance including electric resistance of electrode transport losses of electric charges and ionic resistance of feed streams transport losses of ionic charges qu et al 2015 found that in a cdi system the major circuit resistance should be attributed to the contact resistance between electrodes and current collectors in the case of mcdi dykstra et al 2016 found that the main resistance is from the spacer channel and the external electrical circuit rather than the electrodes in other words the thickness of carbon electrodes i e 260 μm could further increase without a significant increase of energy consumption however this practice would result in an increase in the capital cost the corresponding energy consumption was about 6 1 kj per mole of salt removed dykstra et al 2016 in addition to the system resistance the improvement of electrode materials and thus their capacitance could increase the energy efficiency of cdi however qin et al 2019 found that further increases of capacitance above 300 f g 1 may only have little gain in overall energy efficiency for instance with the significant increases of electrode capacitance from 300 to 1000 f g 1 the energy efficiency of cdi slightly increases from 3 5 to 6 2 in the case of a water flux of 10 l m 2 h 1 in particular as the water flux increases the effect of electrode capacitance on energy efficiency of cdi becomes less remarkable 4 3 costs estimation in comparison to ro cdi technologies are relatively new and the information on cost estimation for large scale operations is not widely available in this section we compile the recent advances on the costs estimation for a cdi plant in terms of energy consumption electrode membrane replacement and total costs 4 3 1 energy consumption as aforementioned the energy consumption of a cdi process depends on the circuit resistance in other words the salinity of the feedwater exhibits a significant influence on the energy consumption of cdi extensive studies have also reported that deploying an energy recovering device such as a supercapacitor chen et al 2019 and a converter battery system tan et al 2020 with cdi during regeneration could compensate the energy consumption required for desalination for instance tan et al 2020 found that incorporation of energy recovery system with membrane cdi could reduce the total energy consumption by 30 40 with a water recovery of 87 it is noted that methods to avoid polarization could effectively minimize energy losses during regeneration for instance using a long regeneration time slow discharge however this might also increase the operating cost and complexity of the cdi design for mcdi to facilitate kinetics while increasing water throughput the reverse polarity by consuming nominal energy during regeneration has been largely applied weinstein and dash 2013 4 3 2 electrodes and membranes the manufacturing cost and scalability of the electrodes are the key factors to the total costs of cdi systems tsai et al 2019 biomass such as sugar cane bagasse zornitta et al 2018 could be utilized as low cost carbon precursor for the synthesis of porous electrodes for maintenance table s4 see supplementary information presents the electrode lifespan and the associated water recovery for cdi and mcdi according to the literature the cost of carbon electrodes ranges between 4 and 50 usd per kg omosebi et al 2017 zuo et al 2008 depending on purity and sophistication caudill 2018 identified that an improvement of electrode lifespan to more than 1000 h could provide a drastic reduction on operating costs for long term operation anodic oxidation due to undesirable faradaic reactions is a critical issue since it leads to electrode deterioration and declined performance zhang et al 2018 proposed several strategies such as developing novel electrodes and deploying alternative cell configurations e g mcdi or operations to mitigate the electrode deterioration by faradaic reactions for mcdi the costs for cell replacement were the largest contributor 81 to the total o m costs while the costs for maintenance energy chemicals and wastewater treatment were all below 10 huyskens et al 2015 this was attributed to the high capital cost for mcdi cell with the assumed short cell lifetime of about 2 years especially for biomass hydrolysates applications sata 2004 for the membrane cost in practice membrane material is directly coated onto the electrodes which is much cheaper than using free standing membranes the cost of ion exchange coatings polymers can be lower than 100 usd per m2 compared to the higher costs of uf 350 usd m2 or nafion 1400 usd m2 membranes zuo et al 2008 4 3 3 total costs the major costs of a cdi stack usually involve capital electricity based operational e g pumps and external power and replacement of electrodes and membranes table 7 summarizes the cost breakdown for a cdi mcdi plant for mcdi the cell cost was found to be the largest contributor 58 of the total capital costs while the maintenance costs were typically assumed to be 5 of equipment costs huyskens et al 2015 metzger et al 2020 also reported similar findings that the costs of ion exchange membranes shared around 80 of the total capital costs for mcdi caudill 2018 successfully developed a pressurized cdi pcdi to increase the lifetime of electrodes by 87 compared to conventional non pressurized cdi if prolonging the lifetime of electrodes from 500 h to 2000 h the total o m costs would significantly reduce from 1 70 to 1 80 to 0 50 0 55 usd m3 caudill 2018 for pcdi although the electricity cost for pumps increases for the sake of maintaining an additional 60 psig the cost saving from the prolonged lifespan of electrodes far outweighs the cost incurred by the electricity cost 4 4 carbon footprint and life cycle environmental impacts only few studies on lca have been conducted to determine the life cycle environmental impacts of cdi technologies for instance yu et al 2016 determined the environmental impacts of cdi equipped with activated carbon carbon black electrodes for brackish water i e salinity of 0 584 g l desalination they found the carbon footprint of cdi was about 1 43 kg co2 eq per m3 of clean water where 56 6 of the carbon footprint was attributed to the electrode materials and the remaining 23 1 and 21 0 were from the energy consumption and chemical components respectively shiu et al 2019 evaluated the environmental impacts of different designs and scales of cdi techniques including mcdi using lca they found that material and chemical usages had the greatest overall impact 52 90 while electricity consumption exhibited a relatively lower impact as low as 9 7 also the change of cdi housing materials from aluminum plates to plastic castings could effectively decrease the overall environmental impacts a recent analysis by metzger et al 2020 estimated the amount of co2 emission for bwro and cdi based technologies they found that in the case of middle east and north africa a transition from bwro to cdi based technology would reduce approximately 130 tons of co2 emissions per day for desalinating the brackish water at a salinity of 3 0 g l 4 5 summary cdi is a relatively new technologies in the field of brackish water desalination to the best of our knowledge only a few large scale cdi plants have been reported and most available studies are conducted at a lab scale the types of electrodes and configurations play important roles in the performance of cdi according to our analysis on the recent literature the typical energy intensity of conventional cdi is approximately 0 1 1 5 kwh m3 depending on the salinity of feedwater and effluent requirement other novel cdi architectures such as mcdi and fcdi could further reduce the energy intensity of desalination compared to conventional cdi the water recovery of cdi systems is generally around 70 90 studies on the lca of brackish water desalination using cdi are still limited the results from available studies indicate that the manufacturing of the electrode materials and the use of chemicals should be the major contributor in life cycle environmental impacts 5 trade off between kinetics and energetics the importance and significance of the energy consumption energetics and productivity kinetics can be illustrated from the thermodynamic perspective pan et al 2018a the minimum energy requirement for desalination regardless of the salt removal mechanism generally increases with the water recovery ratio according to the thermodynamics a superior energetics low energy consumption results in a low operation cost however a slow kinetics low productivity would lead to a huge reactor size thereby increasing the capital and land costs thus for system optimization of brackish water desalination there should be a trade off between kinetic and energetic efficiencies fig 5 illustrates a trade off between capital costs and energy consumption at a given production rate of fresh water for practical desalination systems from the thermodynamic point of view the best design of processes for achieving the minimum costs is not necessarily the most energy efficient design systems operating with perfect energy efficiency thermodynamic reversibility represents a very slow frictionless event an ideal system thereby requiring the largest making resources i e capital costs spiegler and el sayed 2001 as the systems depart from ideality becoming irreversible the operating costs e g energy cost would gradually increase while typically leading to a significant reduction in the capital cost the total cost for producing fresh water could be minimized as there is a trade off between capital costs and energy costs in practice other design parameters such as dimension and weight should be considered to optimize the plant design miller 2003 for the configurations of ro systems lin and elimelech 2017 derived analytical expressions to quantify and optimize the average water flux kinetic efficiency and sec energetic efficiency as shown in fig 6 the o m costs especially energy consumption and membrane replacement would influence their contributions to the total cost of the plant for long term operation ro with a high water flux is not suitable because of the great potential of fouling and scaling lin and elimelech 2017 sablani et al 2001 the system configurations also exhibited significant influence on the energetics and kinetics as well as the economic costs of the auxiliary processes such as pretreatment energy recovery devices and brine treatment these auxiliary processes would in turn affect the overall techno economics of a desalination plant similarly for the cdi systems wang and lin 2018 established a systematic approach to determining the tradeoff between kinetic and energetic efficiencies see fig 7 the kinetic efficiency depends on several factors such as average salt adsorption rate for cdi thereby affecting the clean water productivity the energetic efficiency is directly related to the specific energy consumptions since the operating costs of desalination rely on both kinetic and energetic efficiencies the optimal trade off between kinetics and energetics should be located at the place where the total costs are minimized thus hemmatifar et al 2016 suggested two performance indicators i e average salt adsorption rate asar and energy normalized adsorbed salt representing energy loss per ion removed to characterize the performance of cdi in terms of clean water throughput kinetics and energy efficiency energetics these two indicators provide a powerful tool for balancing resistive and parasitic losses thereby optimizing the overall energy efficiency especially for the energetic efficiencies between ro and cdi qin et al 2019 provided an estimate of the energy consumption in brackish water desalination using mathematical models they found that cdi exhibits greater energy efficiency for a salt rejection of less than 25 with a high water recovery compared to ro however particularly at high salt rejections 50 and moderate to high brackish water salinities 2 10 g l ro is significantly more energy efficient than cdi ramachandran et al 2019a further modified the important scaling values and resistance parameters based on qin s models they found that a reasonably high salt rejection over 70 with a high water recovery of 80 could be achieved by cdi in an energy efficient manner on the same base of assumptions porada et al 2020 found that the energy consumption of mcdi would be lower than that of ro in the case of a feed salinity of 2 3 g l 40 mm at a water recovery of 93 5 a salt rejection of 80 and a total flux of clean water of 11 9 l m 2 h 1 in fact each technology has its own niche area of applications depending upon the goals objectives and targets of the treatment for instance cdi should exhibit better energetic efficiency for desalination of lower salinity brackish water i e 2 g l than ro however for the sake of high salt rejection 80 bwro has demonstrated superior long term performance with a lower capital cost qin et al 2019 if the feedwater contains silica organic matter and pathogens ro would produce an overall better water quality than cdi drewes et al 2009 6 technical economic assessment for technical economic assessment both bwro and cdi must be able to meet a certain salinity standard e g 0 5 g l for drinking water or 1 0 g l for irrigation water for water reclamation on the same basis the criteria used to assess ro and cdi for brackish water desalination include i lifetime oriented total costs ii thermodynamic energy efficiency and clean water productivity iii pretreatment for prolonging the lifetime of key components and iv post treatment for sustainable brine management in this part we discuss the above key components for determining the technical economic performance of bwro and cdi 6 1 lifetime oriented considerations to total costs lifetime oriented considerations to total costs are crucial for the techno economic analysis of brackish water desalination a number of studies have reported the cost estimates based on parameterized process models to project fixed and variable costs at a large scale for ro and cdi bales et al 2019 hand et al 2019 metzger et al 2020 however only a few studies provided the information of total costs based on real plant operations using ro and cdi as presented in table 8 for an ro plant the capital and energy use costs per unit of capacity generally decrease as the size of the plant increases for a bwro plant the capital costs can account for about 35 42 of the total plant costs the second large cost is the energy costs which is up to 25 of the total costs other o m costs include consumable chemicals 14 membrane replacement 12 labor 5 and miscellaneous 8 similar findings were observed in the literature that the unit water price ranges between 0 10 and 1 00 usd m3 miller 2003 sethi 2007 the associated costs include capital 54 energy 11 chemicals 10 labor 9 maintenance 9 and membrane replacement 7 miller 2003 koyuncu et al 2001 suggest that membrane cost usually represents approximately 20 30 of the total capital cost for cdi the capital costs are the large portion to overall water costs accounting for 27 73 of total costs cdt inc texas usa has estimated the total costs of cdi desalination for brackish water with a salinity of 6 4 g l to meet the irrigation water standard i e 1 0 g l hand et al 2019 noticed that lifetime should be the primary factors of water costs for cdi and membrane cdi due to the relatively high portions of capital costs to total costs and it would be more pronounced at a greater reduction in salinity between feed and effluent water for instance for improving the lifetime of cdi from 2 to 5 years the reduction in water costs at 1 46 and 2 92 g l would be 0 07 and 0 17 usd m3 respectively based on a parameterized process model in other words prolonging the lifetimes of cdi systems at more than 2 years would be crucial to realize the cost effectiveness of brackish water desalination similarly drewes et al 2009 suggested that the total costs of desalination using cdi was in the range of 1 93 2 60 usd m3 depending upon the operating flow rate from 0 7 to 3 0 l min per module if the module lifetime is assumed to extend up to 20 years the total cost of desalination would be reduced to 1 76 1 97 usd m3 under the same range of flow rate drewes et al 2009 est water china also deployed several large scale cdi plants in mainland china for desalinating various types of produced water the estimated costs for energy consumption and module maintenance were 0 055 usd m3 and 0 014 usd m3 respectively est 2009 improved engineering design such as less pretreatment efficient desalination unit and effective brine management is the key to lower overall desalination costs bwro requires more professional staff for operating high pressure pumps heaters and clean in place systems while cdi usually operates at ambient pressure and temperature in the case of bwro anqi et al 2015 have conducted numerical simulations to evaluate the desalination performance they found that the sherwood number is strongly dependent on the reynolds number as well as the configurations of spacers especially for local sherwood number in other words both the pressure drops and the arrangement e g spacing of turbulators should be optimized for a given range of reynolds numbers 6 2 energy efficiency and clean water productivity in response to the water and energy nexus under global climate change a major reconsideration of desalination technologies regarding the energy efficiency and the impact of the concentrated brine on the discharge environment has occurred in fact thermodynamic energy efficiency could help us to understand the limit for further improvement on specific energy consumption among different desalination technologies wang et al 2019a also suggested to consider both thermodynamic energy efficiency and specific energy consumption when comparing different desalination systems and processes from the thermodynamic point of view cdi is more energy efficient for brackish water desalination compared to ro however the total energy consumption of the current ro system mostly on a plant scale cannot usefully be compared to the cdi values which are often at the lab scale as cdi technologies are relatively new compared to ro the currently available data of energy consumption from large scale cdi operations is similar to that of ro the improvements of both ro membranes and energy recovery devices have made significant breakthrough on the energy consumption of bwro being close to the thermodynamic limits in contrast the electrode materials and cell design of cdi are still under extensive research resulting in improved cdi performance with each novel material conversely high energy consumption of cdi is largely due to application of high currents however larger treatment capacities will overcome this limitation to achieve an industrial scale operation cdi technologies should balance the capital cost the number of modules and the energy cost the effective area of electrodes hand et al 2019 found that energy consumption is not very relevant for cdi which can be a small fraction of total costs especially for membrane cdi aside from energy efficiency the water productivity and recovery ratio are essential to overall water costs as they are associated with the subsequent brine management regardless the mechanisms of desalination various quantities of brine the concentrate stream would be produced from processes as a by product for the same treatment capacity the desalination plant with a lower recovery ratio will generate a greater amount of concentrate brine the quality and quantity of the brine would determine the optimum approach to subsequent management and utilization drewes et al 2009 found that the salinity of brine from ro 20 22 g l was much higher than that from cdi 7 8 g l according to the data from large scale operation the quantity of brine from ro was ten times less than that from cdi drewes et al 2009 this was attributed to the large amount of water for electrode regeneration and rinsing in cdi due to the slow electro desorption kinetics recently the significant improvement on water recovery of cdi has been achieved ramachandran et al 2019b developed a new scheme based on variable flowrate operation to increase water recovery for cdi with a minimal additional cost they successfully demonstrated a high water recovery ratio of 90 while improving thermodynamic efficiency by at least 2 fold this would produce a significant less volume of brine solution compared to conventional constant flowrate operation for flow electrode cdi ma et al 2019 achieved an extreme water recovery of 95 99 with the brine concentration of 20 50 g l though the charge efficiency is compromised 6 3 pretreatment for prolonging life time of key components dynamics of feedwater characteristics e g salinity and temperature must be considered in designing a brackish water desalination system for instance temperature variance may result in membrane scaling especially when the concentrations of silica and bicarbonate in the feedwater are high alghoul et al 2009 the fouling and scaling would be potential issues to membrane operations in bwro while conventional cdi has relatively less issues with fouling and scaling for membrane cdi scaling and fouling would still be a challenge chang et al 2002 bwro systems typically require pretreatment to prevent membrane scaling and fouling including ph adjustment dosing system of antiscalants and disinfectants optional and microfiltration cdi systems need a cartridge filtration as the pretreatment and might require additional pre treatment to remove organic matter a number of studies have reported that the content of organic matter would reduce the sorption capacity of cdi electrodes by fouling gabelich et al 2002 zhang et al 2013 or ferric species scaling wang et al 2019b surface modification on cdi electrodes might be potential solutions to improve the resistance of cdi systems against fouling and scaling pugazhenthiran et al 2015 wu et al 2017b zhang and jia 2015 for energy efficient ro optimization a specific concentration limit on the product stream must be adhered while applying suitable feed pressure to minimize spatial variance in flux wei et al 2017 the life span of an ro membrane increases by using a low feed pressure however this results in compromising water recovery ratios the key components affecting the desalination performance of ro or cdi include membranes and electrodes the life cycle of an ro plant is approximately 20 years where the major maintenance is membrane replacement at about every 5 7 years however both membrane and electrode lifetime could be significantly shortened by severe fouling due to improper pretreatment of feedwater for membranes manufacturers will normally provide detailed instructions for standard operation and maintenance procedures of their membrane products proper pretreatment of feedwater and periodical membrane cleaning are required to maximize the efficiency of desalination and ensure the life time of membranes asadollahi et al 2017 avlonitis et al 2003 for life time of electrodes in cdi welgemoed and schutte 2005 estimated that electrodes could last for 10 years in the case of carbon aerogel electrodes wang et al 2019b also suggested that the foulant caused by ferric ions e g fe2o3 were irreversible once formed on the electrodes which could be difficult to be entirely removed by backwash the necessary and extent of pretreatment relies on the quality of feedwater the plant location and the intake system however one of the challenges in leveraging brackish water is the dynamics of feedwater quality surface water such as seawater and wastewater typically contains readily available nutrients natural organic matter and oxygen for bio respiration therefore when surface water is involved pretreatment is essential to ensure separation efficiency and avoid biological fouling and scaling due to the presence of multiple ions such as carbonates and sulfates barium magnesium and calcium for membrane technologies conventional pretreatment typically for ro processes includes chemicals addition chemical pretreatment and generally contains flocculation sedimentation and filtration physical pretreatment to mechanically remove algae colloids and particles other pretreatments include ultrafiltration uf gao et al 2016 cartridge filtration farhat et al 2020 microfiltration wu et al 2017a forward osmosis khanzada et al 2017 and dissolved air flotation henthorne and boysen 2015 these alternatives are also considered as effective approaches to reducing membrane fouling potential and cleaning frequencies table 9 presents the costs of various pretreatment methods for ro and cdi plants according to the site measurements the conventional pretreatment can achieve a water recovery of 99 with the electricity consumption as low as 0 025 kwh per m3 of feedwater vince et al 2008 the reported costs of conventional pretreatment were approximately 0 13 usd m3 pearce 2008 however the conventional pretreatment is chemicals labor intensive and space consuming van hoof et al 2001 the land footprint of conventional pretreatment is approximately 35 40 m2 per 1000 m3 permeate per day wilf 2004 in contrast the land footprint for uf pretreatment is only 30 60 of conventional pretreatment wolf and siverns 2004 the reported uf treatment costs vary from 0 21 usd m3 to 0 52 usd m3 glueckstern and priel 2003 jurenka et al 2001 on the other hand the typical lifetime of media filter and uf membranes is 20 30 and 5 10 years respectively wolf and siverns 2004 thus there is an optimal choice of technology to use for pretreatment based on operating costs and lifetime for the media filtration the reported costs were approximately 0 51 usd m3 glueckstern and priel 2003 which was similar to that of uf pretreatment for cdi a number of studies have indicated that cdi needs only simple pretreatment such as cartridge filtration xu et al 2008b the reported o m costs for cartridge filtration were approximately 0 015 0 021 usd m3 farhat et al 2020 the low micron range cartridge filtration could be utilized for ro plants as a protection for the subsequent high pressure pumps 6 4 post treatment options for sustainable brine management for both bwro and cdi post treatment could represent a significant portion of the total water production costs as these two technologies will generate a high concentration brine metzger et al 2020 also highlighted that the brine generated from desalination facilities would pose severe environmental impacts and becomes an increasing economic concern there are different options for the disposal or treatment of brine from a desalination plant the costs of concentrated brine disposal the selection of brine disposal methods represents a compromise between technology availability total cost local resources and environmental impacts table 10 compiles the costs of various concentrated brine disposal methods surface water i e ocean river lake and lagoon discharge is the most common management practice since it is the least expensive option among other available brine disposals however it is often limited to coastal desalination plants it may also change the salinity of the receiving water depending upon water recovery and concentrate factor thereby changing the water chemistry e g dissolved gases and lack of oxygen and affecting aquatic animals several studies purnama et al 2005 smith et al 2007 showed that an increase in costal desalination installations at the arabian gulf would increase the salinity in the gulf leading to local variations in dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature therefore for surface water discharge mickley 2004 suggested a standard limit of the salinity difference between the concentrate stream and receiving water less than 10 if the feed of brackish water desalination is groundwater the concentrate brine must be treated before disposal since it typically contains high concentrations of gases such as co2 ammonia and h2s these dissolved gases are harmful and toxic to aquatic life besides surface water disposal combined sewer disposal if available is usually the next option as a relatively low cost disposal method huyskens et al 2015 reported the costs of brine disposal in wastewater treatment plants at about 1 26 usd m3 beside further treatment the brine reject can be directly utilized via various approaches e g mixed with raw water to provide the use of irrigation purposes peñate et al 2014 also salinity gradient energy so called blue energy in brine could be harvested by various promising technologies such as pressure retarded osmosis benjamin et al 2020 reverse electrodialysis nam et al 2019 capacitive mixing simoncelli et al 2018 and 2d nanopore diffusio osmosis siria et al 2017 6 5 summary the total costs of a desalination plant for producing clean water include capital o m labor and miscellaneous costs other important adjunct units to desalination such as pretreatment post treatment brine discharge and waste management also should be considered in the total costs these costs largely depend on local conditions such as the method of desalination source water quality clean water productivity capacity and availability of concentrate disposal sites in fact it is difficult to comprehensively compare the total costs of bwro and cdi as at the same removal ratio the water recovery ratios of bwro and cdi are quite different as we discussed lifetime oriented considerations including pretreatment of feedwater desalination facilities and post treatment to total costs are important for the techno economic analysis of brackish water desalination in general for ro the major cost components include capital costs of modules and energy consumption due to high pressure pumps for cdi the major cost components include the capital costs of modules and electrode replacement ro needs periodical membrane cleaning to control fouling and scaling while cdi uses electrochemical reactions or electrostatics to regenerate the saturated or fouled electrodes thus the cost for chemicals use in ro for membrane regeneration would be generally higher than that in cdi and the cost for electrode regeneration in cdi is embedded in the cost of its energy consumption in addition the quality and quantity of the brine solution generated from bwro and cdi are quite different therefore the costs of brine management would be the major concern when evaluating the total costs of brackish water desalination 7 perspectives prospects and priority research directions cdi has shown better energy efficiency for desalination of lower salinity brackish water i e 2 g l than ro however for the sake of high salt rejection 80 ro has demonstrated superior long term performance with a lower capital cost qin et al 2019 ro also can produce an overall better water quality than cdi as ro is effective to remove silica organic matter and pathogens drewes et al 2009 because of these special pros and cons we believe that each technology has its own niche area of applications depending upon the goals objectives and targets of the treatment in this part we suggest three prior research directions from the aspects of i more cost effective desalination ii high selectivity and iii sustainable brine management to optimize the desalination of brackish water and address the challenges and opportunities in water and energy nexus 7 1 hybridization for energy efficient brackish water desalination ro is the most commonly used technology since it can tackle the entire range of saline waters up to seawater although it is not energy efficient at a low salinity 3 g l tds from the thermodynamic point of view cdi or other electrokinetically driven techniques such as electrodialysis reversal liu and wang 2017 and electrodeionization pan et al 2018b should be energetically more efficient for brackish water desalination compared to pressure or thermally driven techniques although we focused on only cdi in this review each desalination technology should exhibit its own best operation with the highest energy efficiency at a certain range of feedwater quality therefore hybridization could provide the synergetic solution to energy efficient and fit for purpose water for developing a sustainable water supply especially for brackish water reuse for instance sarai atab et al 2018 analyzed the hybridization of ro with an adsorption cycle for providing large quantities of water for irrigation 24 000 m3 d and high quality water for domestic use the proposed hybrid plant has the minimum specific energy about 0 8 kwh m3 at ro recovery of 45 with a production cost of 0 56 usd m3 sarai atab et al 2018 however compared to existing municipal water sources desalinated water still comes at substantially higher costs carter 2015 the choice of desalination mechanisms techniques and their configurations depend on numerous factors such as the quality of the feed targeted quality and productivity of reclaimed water and options for brine disposal these factors sometimes are related to the local regulatory standards and requirements for identifying the best available design and operation strategies li and noh 2012 suggested that a relationship between water recovery and membrane lifetime especially for bwro should be established to incorporate capital and operating costs along with the system optimization in the future the hybridization of different separation technologies incorporated with renewable energy for energy efficient brackish water desalination should be evaluated in addition to hybridization for energy efficient brackish water desalination the development of district water e g desalination and energy e g renewables supply center provides great opportunities for advancing overall energy and water efficiency inland brackish water desalination can be coupled with renewable energy to augment freshwater supply sustainably especially at remote areas that lack access to a reliable electricity grid production of clean water also could be considered as an option of energy storage for intermittent renewables therefore the design of desalination plants should be considered along with the planning procedure of district energy supply system for supporting ancillary services in wholesale energy markets this could ensure the security and sustainability of water and energy supply several field tests have been conducted to demonstrate its feasibility and reliability such as solar photovoltaic electricity at pakistan khanzada et al 2017 and malaysia alghoul et al 2016 kim et al 2016 also conducted a dynamic performance analysis to evaluate the feasibility of integrated hybrid energy systems with ro desalination plants and identify its dynamic characteristics similar to ro the energy demands of cdi can be met by renewable energy sources such as solar pv coupling a cdi unit with pv makes the water desalination system self sufficient in energy demands and could be deployed in remote off grid locations mehrabian nejad et al 2017 distributed modular cdi have been combined with solar cell modules in recent reported research tan et al 2018 wu et al 2017b adequate infrastructure is essential to address long term water and energy scarcity challenges centralized desalination plants are usually practiced in larger scales including urban areas and cities while decentralized plants are employed for rural or remote regions that lack access to centralized systems silva herran and nakata 2012 vakilifard et al 2018 examined the role of water energy nexus in optimizing water supply systems and they found that there is a research need in the optimization of the decentralized water energy supply system independently or as an integral part of a centralized system in urban areas in addition to the optimization of water supply systems the research efforts covering instrumentation control and automation ica of energy efficient water technologies for brackish water desalination systems should be addressed in the context of future smart cities 7 2 co removal of specific components in brackish water development of scalable affordable and robust cdi electrodes with a high ion adsorption capacity can facilitate the deployment of desalination for widely available brackish water sources although cdi is effective to remove salts from water a comprehensive study on electrosorption of competing ions in brackish water is needed to understand the behavior of cdi electrodes huang et al 2017 strongly recommended applying a three electrode cell for examining the electrosorption behaviors of carbon materials in practice brackish water may contain various contaminant ions such as arsenic fluoride boron phosphate lithium iodide copper cadmium ferric and nitrate ions some of the above mentioned ions in brackish water are classified as precious metals e g lithium which could be further precisely separated and recovered by electrokinetic methods on the other hand more regulations on effluent water quality have resulted in that boron and arsenic are becoming of main interests since they are typically difficult to remove by ro despite the recent advances of membranes boron br and arsenic as rejection remains low in comparison to other inorganic components such as sodium chloride teychene et al 2013 in addition to removal of inorganic ions co removal of organic matter in brackish water has been the focus of intense scientific and practical efforts for instance lester et al 2020 developed a novel configuration of cdi with activated carbon electrodes to remove both salt and trace organic hydrophobic compounds such as bisphenol a and estrone from wastewater to maximize the removal of other compounds of interest plant design e g membrane selection and optimization warrant significant attention technological improvement and breakthrough for both membranes and electrodes could enhance economical separations to drive market penetration for brackish water desalination a number of studies have suggested that nanotechnology enable materials such as ion exchange membranes could facilitate the wide adoption of water desalination alabi et al 2018 mauter et al 2018 for membrane desalination effective removal of divalent cations at ultrafast water flux and low pressure operation as well as in situ regeneration for fouling and scaling control are important novel membrane materials such as graphene oxide membranes mi 2014 zheng et al 2017 have been under developed and investigated this could support the use of brackish water in cooling systems with minimal scaling and brine production future research on development of brackish water desalination also should focus on the removal of other regulated contaminants of emerging concern such as disinfection byproduct pharmaceutical and personal care products and endocrine disrupting compounds 7 3 sustainable brine management with innovative utilization desalination typically generates concentrated brine that contains relatively high concentrations of salts organic matter and inorganic constituents e g boron and copper one of the critical concerns to inland brackish water desalination is concentrated brine disposal due to its potentially high costs as aforementioned if surface water disposal is used for brine treatment its environmental impacts on local water bodies also should be critically evaluated via an lca when ocean disposal of such streams or deep well injection is not available zero liquid discharge zld strategies are usually required to reduce the volume of concentrate while simultaneously removing contaminants from the brine zld typically involves thermally drying of concentrated brine such as thermal concentrate crystallization choi et al 2018 and capillary crystallization abahusayn 2011 sobhani et al 2012 which are deployed at high energy and capital costs gray et al 2011 therefore there is still an urgent need for innovative brine management and utilization to allow economic use of inland brackish water resources for instance engineered natural systems via biological approaches might become an alternative to manage the concentrated brine as well as to handle the issues of organics nitrate and other contaminants similarly when low grade heat such as residual heat from power plants or geothermal energy is nearby accessible membrane distillation could be deployed to increase water recovery prior to brine crystallizer deshmukh et al 2018 these innovative approaches of brine utilization could provide the potential to further recover nutrients minerals and energy for realizing a circular economy aside from the end of facility treatment optimization of chemicals and antiscalants dosing is of strategical importance to improve the cost of subsequent brine management sweity et al 2015 found that several antiscalants e g polyacrylate based or polyphosphonate based could significantly contribute to the biofouling of ro membranes where the biofouling enhancement potential should be critically screened along with their antiscaling activity similarly both energy efficiency related to energy consumption and clean water productivity related to water recovery are critical parameters to realize the zld of a desalination plant taking the example of bwro the achievable water recovery is typically 60 85 and thus results in a concentration factor of 2 5 6 7 however with a high water recovery of 97 the concentration factor would increase to more than 33 3 leading to relatively high costs for zld processes in other words both the energy consumption and water recovery should be practically balanced with the consideration of subsequent brine disposal to achieve an overall cost effective scenario 8 concluding remarks brackish water is an important alternative to fresh water resources potentially enabling the movement of the water energy nexus away from the seacoast further inland technology maturity determines the extent of practical deployment ro has been fully commercialized for decades whereas cdi has not yet achieved widespread market adoption further improvements on desalination technologies would provide significant potential to ensure the availability accessibility and affordability of fit for purpose fresh water from brackish water the quality of feedwater plays a critical role in the selection design and operation of desalination technologies because one of the challenges in exploitation of brackish water is the dynamics of feedwater quality to facilitate the exploitation of brackish water we suggest three prior research directions for the optimization of brackish water desalination while addressing the challenges and opportunities in water and energy nexus including hybridization for energy efficient brackish water desalination co removal of specific components in brackish water and sustainable brine management with innovative utilization for both bwro and cdi development of sustainable brine management with innovative utilization would effectively mitigate the environmental impacts and reduce the o m costs along the way achieving as high as possible on water recovery would directly decrease the amount of the brine generation from desalination facilities which would

17727,frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms habs and red tides in freshwater and seawater poses serious threats to water treatment and drives the application of membrane based technologies in algal separation despite the high removal efficiency of algal cells and their metabolites e g organic matter and toxins by membranes the generation of concentrate and waste streams presents a major challenge in this paper we review the scenarios under which membrane based processes are integrated with algal separation with particular attention given to i drinking water production and desalination at low algal concentrations and ii cyanobacteria laden water treatment desalination the concentrate and waste streams from backwashing and membrane cleaning in each scenario are characterised with this information facilitating a better understanding of the transport of algal cells and metabolites in membrane processes current strategies and gaps in managing concentrate and

microalgae are an extremely large and diverse group of organisms and include both prokaryotes and eukaryotes capable of photosynthesis they are critical to the aquatic ecosystem and the biosphere for oxygen production and carbon fixation rai et al 2000 however their excessive growth in some natural environments such as commonly occurring in eutrophic or polluted water bodies can result in severe oxygen depletion and damage to the aquatic habitats loza et al 2014 certain microalgae e g microcystis aeruginosa can produce toxins which pose a threat to public health through either drinking contaminated water or consumption of food that has been processed with contaminated water caron et al 2010 song et al 2018b westrick 2008 for example microcystin lr mc lr with amino acids leucine l and arginine r at positions 2 and 4 respectively has been listed as one of the most potent water toxins in the united states greer et al 2018 due to their frequent occurrence often at elevated concentrations algal removal from affected source waters at high efficiency and low cost is of great practical importance conventional technologies applied for algal treatment include coagulation centrifugation dissolved air flotation chemical oxidation i e disinfection and pre oxidation and filtration christenson and sims 2011 henderson et al 2008a naceradska et al 2017 despite substantial progress achieved with these methods critical challenges remain for example coagulation the most common water treatment method can partially remove algal cells but has low efficiency against soluble algal toxins ghernaout et al 2010 centrifugation is considered to be one of the most effective separation methods but the high shear force produced in this energy intensive process can easily damage the cell membrane resulting in the release of algal toxins chen et al 2011 christenson and sims 2011 while dissolved air flotation of algal cells is attractive in view of its low operating cost the presence of chemicals to aid this process raises other problems such as disposal of the chemical sludge granados et al 2012 additionally chemical oxidation may result in the generation of secondary pollutants for example it has been reported that chloramination of waters containing organics at elevated concentrations likely leads to the formation of harmful by products such as trihalomethanes and n nitrosodimethylamine furst et al 2018 in recent years membrane based processes have gained increasing popularity as a means of algal separation as a result of their high separation efficiency and low footprint liu et al 2017 microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have particular benefits for algal separation because they can achieve complete retention of algal cells and at least for the smaller pore sized membranes remarkable removal of solutes e g organic matter and toxins bilad et al 2014 teixeira and rosa 2005 following the early trial by koseoglu and batchelor 1993 of use of membrane processes for algae retention and the first systematic study of algae removal from source waters using membranes by chow et al 1997 the continual improvement in membrane materials and optimization of operating parameters has made this method competitive in terms of both cost and effectiveness compared to centrifugation bilad et al 2012 nevertheless membrane based algal separation faces two major drawbacks i membrane fouling which leads to a notable decrease in membrane permeability heng et al 2008 hung and liu 2006 zhang et al 2013a and consequently the need for frequent cleaning and maintenance judd 2016 wang et al 2014 and ii the need for management of concentrate and waste streams that may contain cells and toxins at much high levels investigation of the algal induced membrane fouling mechanism and associated control strategies has become an important research topic which has been addressed by a number of research groups liu et al 2017 qu et al 2012a villacorte et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 there are also comprehensive review papers on recent achievements and opportunities in membrane materials and processes for algal separation liao et al 2018 luo et al 2017 zhang and fu 2018 nevertheless a systematic overview of the management and treatment methods for the concentrate and waste streams is not yet available which prompts us to provide a comprehensive review on this important topic essentially the volume ratio and composition of the concentrate and waste streams is largely determined by the choice of membrane processes in water treatment khan et al 2009 van der bruggen et al 2003 as well as the algal and toxin concentrations and the salinity of the feed solution liu et al 2017 schurer et al 2013 as such we have based this review paper around two scenarios in which membrane based processes are integrated with algal separation i drinking water production and desalination at low algal concentrations and ii cyanobacteria laden water treatment especially under seasonal cyanobacterial blooms the gaps in knowledge with regard to managing concentrate and waste streams generated from backwashing and membrane cleaning are identified and guidance and perspectives for future studies in membrane based algal separation for water treatment are provided 2 classification of membranes and scenarios in algal separation in this section we will introduce the membranes used for algal separation and the streams i e the permeate concentrate and waste streams generated during the filtration the application scenarios are classified into two categories i e i drinking water production and desalination at low algal concentrations and ii cyanobacteria laden water treatment with their characteristics discussed individually 2 1 membranes table 1 summarises commonly used membranes for algal separation specifically mf and uf are low pressure membranes with their pore sizes smaller than microalgae cells these porous pressure driven membranes can be used to address habs in surface waters huang et al 2009a or to pretreat the feed stream to ro in seawater desalination villacorte et al 2015 compared to their low pressure counterparts ro and nf have smaller molecular weight cut off mwco table 1 but require substantially higher pressure high pressure membranes are not expected to be directly used for algal separation e g red tides during ro based seawater desalination because of the severe membrane fouling and high operating cost that would result nevertheless issues related to the retention of dissolved organic matter and toxins if any in the feed to ro and nf must still be addressed seubert et al 2012 considering that algal sizes are at the micrometer scale e g m aeruginosa 3 0 7 0 μm chlorella sp 3 0 8 0 μm and alexandrium tamrensis 20 42 μm granéli and turner 2006 all aforementioned membranes table 1 are capable of rejecting algal cells by size exclusion in comparison mwco governs the retention of dissolved organic matter toxins and algae derived odor compounds e g 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib and geosmin with much smaller size for a typical membrane process the feed solution is separated into two streams as a result of treatment fig 1 the product water permeating through the membrane i e the permeate and the rejected water containing concentrated contaminants i e the concentrate to mitigate membrane fouling backwashing for the case of porous membranes and chemical cleaning are often utilised wang et al 2014 with these processes generating additional waste streams in order to elucidate the challenges for management of the concentrate and waste streams in a more systematic manner we consider two major application scenarios i drinking water production and desalination at low algal toxin concentrations low concentration lc and ii cyanobacteria laden water treatment desalination high concentration and high toxicity hc htox fig 1 it is worthwhile noting that the composition of the feed solution to the membrane process may differ substantially from that of the raw water due to the presence of pre treatment processes such as coagulation and sedimentation furthermore the composition of the concentrate and waste streams is affected by the type of membrane operation and chemicals used if any which could differ substantially for low mf and uf and high pressure nf and ro membrane processes therefore under each scenario low and high pressure membrane processes are discussed separately 2 2 lc scenario drinking water production and desalination at low algal concentrations this is the most common scenario for drinking water production from surface water treatment with typical feed salinity 500 mg l and seawater desalination salinity typically 35 g l using membrane technologies in this scenario the algal and toxin concentration in source waters is relatively low for example the green algae alert by waternsw australia according to the national health and medical research council is 500 cells ml of m aeruginosa for fresh water or 10 cells ml of karenia brevis for coastal water nhmrc 2008 and the world health organization guideline for mc lr in fresh water is 1 μg l sikka and hellstrom 2017 implementation of conventional processes such as coagulation and activated carbon adsorption generally meets the standards for turbidity and heavy metals fig 2 a membrane based technologies are capable of polishing the effluent by removal of residual colloidal matter and or dissolved solutes table 1 in this case algal cells may be occasionally involved in membrane fouling and algal organic matter aom typically contributes only a small portion of the membrane foulant despite the low concentrations of algal toxins in the lc scenario the concentrate and backwashing streams are expected to contain much more organic matter compared to the feed solution as such the 10 recycling rule i e the recycle flow 10 of the raw water flow has been implemented by the us environmental protection agency epa 2002 in general there are few challenges with regard to disinfection and management of the outfalls for the discharge of mf uf concentrate and backwashing streams into the environment however the discharge of ro concentrate back to seawater can result in critical issues such as the generation of a dense plume that sinks to the seafloor and disrupts marine communities pérez gonzález et al 2012 though it is now recognised that the implementation of an appropriately designed diffusion device would largely avoid the adverse impacts missimer and maliva 2018 2 3 hc htox scenario cyanobacteria laden water treatment desalination this scenario is applicable to the treatment of source waters during seasonal cyanobacterial blooms table 2 summarises the characteristics of algae and toxins in cyanobacteria laden waters numerous studies have reported that paralytic shellfish poisoning and cyanobacterial toxin poisoning can pose great threats to human health for example the toxicology of paralytic shellfish poisoning by alexandrium sp in red tide blooms is similar to that of tetrodotoxin etheridge 2010 uptake of more than 80 μg of saxitoxin to 100 g of tissue may lead to death in severe cases table 2 etheridge 2010 cyanobacterial toxin poisoning mainly occurs in freshwater areas where ingestion of toxin contaminated water is more likely westrick 2008 among the various habs in the hc htox scenario m aeruginosa and anabaena flos aquae are particularly widely distributed hazardous species m aeruginosa can produce the most widely distributed hepatotoxin microcystin mc granéli and turner 2006 mcs have a strong resistance to proteolytic enzymes with over 70 variants found e g mc lr mc ar and mc yr carmichael 1992 according to national health and medical research council guidelines nhmrc 2008 the alert for a hc htox scenario is raised when 50 000 cells ml of m aeruginosa are present or a biovolume of all toxin producing cyanobacteria exceeds 4 mm3 l or 10 mm3 l for all algae in fresh water while 10 cells ml of karenia brevis is applied for coastal water the high abundance of cyanobacteria at these alert levels would lead to a concentration of total microcystins 10 μg l nhmrc 2008 in spring 2007 a cyanobacteria bloom covered almost one third of taihu lake which directly led to restriction of water supplies for around 5 million residents of wuxi city in china li et al 2011 moreover although neither 2 mib nor geosmin the typical algal odor compounds has any known adverse biological or pathological effects giglio et al 2011 a level of 10 ng l in water at habs is considered to be above the taste and smell threshold reynolds 2010 table 2 likewise non toxic algal blooms will not necessarily lead to serious health issues but may result in deterioration of aquatic habitats and water quality via generation of mucilage and or transparent exopolymer particles teps bar zeev et al 2015 gotsis skretas 1995 hamilton et al 2005 due to the relatively high algal concentration and the possibility that the source waters exhibit high toxicity and unpleasant odor the efficiency of pretreatment processes such as coagulation is typically compromised more importantly the removal of dissolved toxins and odor compounds likely requires additional chemical oxidation steps fig 2a although membrane based separation can be integrated to improve process performance table 1 it results in the accumulation of algal cells and toxins in the concentrate the backwashing waste in the hc htox scenario becomes more difficult to deal with fig 1 because of the release of algal cells and organic matter and toxins from the cake layer li et al 2014 in practical processes the backwashing water is alternatively from the disinfection tank and the secondary byproducts e g aldehydes ketones and halogenated byproducts from the reaction of aom and disinfectants would be contained in backwashing waste in comparison the composition and toxicity of the waste stream from chemical cleaning are strongly influenced by the chemical reagents and the dose used with the possibility of generation of other products from reactions with the cleaning reagents wang et al 2014 while the use of oxidants can degrade a portion of the dissolved toxins this practice can damage cell integrity and result in the massive release of intracellular toxins hall et al 2000 zamyadi et al 2012 into the chemical waste 3 concentrate and waste streams in lc and hc htox scenarios this section is focused on the review of concentrate and waste streams in the established lc and hc htox scenarios standardisation of the basic characteristics e g volume ratio and concentration factor is provided and detailed assessment of these characteristics is provided for mf uf nf and ro in lc and hc htox scenarios particular attention is paid to the transformations of aom toxins and odor compounds during filtration and the impacts of these transformations on the composition of concentrate and waste streams 3 1 basic characteristics of the concentrate and waste streams concentrate in this review paper the concentrate represents either i the retentate stream in cross flow or semi dead end operation of mf uf zeman and zydney 2017 or ii the retentate stream and the intermediate forward flushing stream in cross flow operation of nf ro pérez gonzález et al 2012 fig 1 as forward flushing is usually conducted during desalination i e during the generation of the retentate the volume of the nf ro concentrate is made up of the sum of the retentate and forward flushing streams the concentrate to feed solution volume ratio cr is related to the apparent water recovery wr app i e the permeate to feed solution volume ratio by eq 1 in table 3 van der bruggen et al 2003 typically the cr is 1 10 for mf epa 2002 and uf 15 30 for nf and 15 60 for ro khan et al 2009 assuming that the mass loss due to fouling is minimal compared to the mass in the feed concentrate and permeate the concentration factor cf defined as the concentration ratio of concentrate over the feed solution c c i c f i can be obtained by an overall mass balance eq 2 in table 3 greenlee et al 2009 the rejection of all membranes for algal cells is close to 1 i e cf 1 cr determination of the rejection and cf for aom toxins and odor compounds is more complicated and will be discussed in section 3 2 backwashing waste in membrane based algal separation hydraulic cleaning such as backwashing is always used for porous membranes e g mf uf to remove the physically reversible fouling and to restore the permeability ferrer et al 2016 this cleaning process generates a backwashing waste stream fig 1 the backwashing to feed solution volume ratio br is determined by the backwashing tmp δp bw t backwashing duration bw d min and backwashing frequency bw f time per min eqs 3 and 4 in table 3 ferrer et al 2016 wang et al 2014 an empirical flow ratio of 0 8 1 2 can be applied to q bw q f with br values of 5 15 documented in some published papers chew et al 2016 oh et al 2006 as such the wr app eq 1 should be adjusted to wr adj 1 cr br in comparison estimation of the concentration factor for the backwashing waste is challenging because it depends on various operating parameters such as the total mass of the cake layer the portion released and the source of the backwashing water it is easier to directly measure the concentration of constituents e g algal cells aom and toxins in the backwashing waste chemical cleaning waste chemical cleaning typically known as cleaning in place cip shi et al 2014 wang et al 2014 removes scale organic fouling and biofouling and results in a chemical waste stream the volume and volume ratio of this stream is small 1 especially in the lc scenario compared to cr and br though the composition is more complex and depends on the chemicals added such as citric acid and edta for scale removal and naocl for organic fouling and biofouling removal villacorte et al 2015 wang et al 2010 moreover consideration should be given to the presence of high concentrations of coexisting ions e g na and cl in seawater in addition to the residual chemicals 3 2 mf uf concentrate and waste streams in lc and hc htox scenarios mf uf is increasingly used in disinfectant free production and distribution of drinking water schurer et al 2019 particularly given the good performance of uf in rejecting high mw organic carbon that plays an active role in the regrowth of aeromonads hijnen et al 2018 the mf uf concentrate is typically termed a recirculation loop stream because this is the general practice for concentrate processing in an mf uf system as such cr is rarely discussed in the lc scenario though the resultant organic concentrations in the recirculation loop can be as high as 100 mg carbon l but still lower than the recommended criteria of 600 mg carbon l oh et al 2006 in pilot tests backwashing is conducted every 20 30 min i e bw f 1 20 1 30 per min with a bw d of 0 5 min and δp bw t 0 2 mpa as summarised in table 4 the br value for the lc scenario is generally 5 it has been suggested that a combined concentrate and backwashing stream should follow the 10 recycling rule epa 2002 i e cr br 10 nevertheless an industrial scale study by chew et al 2016 showed that the percentage of water losses by combined pretreatment and backwashing in a uf system 11 could be roughly double that of a conventional media filtration system compared with the relatively dilute backwashing waste the concentration of the chemical cleaning waste based on total organic carbon can be 1 2 orders of magnitudes higher oh et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 it is worthwhile noting that current studies of the small volume chemical waste volume ratio 1 table 4 is largely related to improving our understanding of the membrane foulant components that are resistant to hydraulic cleaning wang et al 2010 rather than investigation of suitable methods for disposal of the chemical waste in hc htox the rejection of mf uf membranes for algal cells is close to 1 with cell deposition insignificantly affecting the mass balance cf for algal cells in the concentrate is therefore around 10 100 in comparison the composition of aom and toxins in the concentrate and waste streams is related to the membrane rejection and then backwashing and cleaning mechanism note that since odor compounds have comparable mw with small toxins their removal by mf uf membranes should occur in a similar manner and will not be discussed separately considering that the mwco of mf uf table 1 is typically larger than the mw of algal toxins e g 165 2 da of anatoxin a in table 2 four pathways can be proposed for the mechanism of removal of these toxins fig 3 i size exclusion of intracellular cell bound toxins in the hc htox scenario the rejection of toxins by mf uf largely depends on the cell integrity because algal toxins are originally intracellular minimal cell breakage 2 5 has been found during uf filtration resulting in pathway i in fig 3 accounting for over 95 rejection of toxins gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 liu et al 2017 ii size exclusion and iii adsorption of aqueous toxin assemblages i e toxin aom aq by membranes lee and walker 2008 aom can be classified into two groups those remaining inside cells and referred to as intracellular organic matter iom and those secreted into the solution and referred to as extracellular organic matter eom zhou et al 2014 since iom is inside algal cells with minimal amount released into the bulk solution due to the cell lysis fig 3 eom is expected to dominate the interaction between aom and the aqueous toxin as such the fate of eom and its active role in toxin rejection i e rejection of toxin eom aq should be taken into account in pathways ii and iii table 5 classifies the characteristics of eom of representative algal species e g m aeruginosa blooms in fresh water and chaetoceros muelleri in coastal water most organics in eom are hydrophilic with the hydrophilic fraction hpi accounting for 60 table 5 while the hydrophobic fraction hpo is present at lower abundance the mw distribution of eom is quite wide for instance the mw of eom of the representative algal species except for asterionella formosa henderson et al 2008b is divided into two size regions that is 30 60 20 100 kda an mwco for biopolymers and 40 60 1 kda an mwco for humics table 5 these findings are generally in accord with the rejection 50 of eom by mf uf membranes li et al 2014 although the hydrophilicity of toxins and the relatively large mwco of uf membranes are expected to lead to lower rejection unexpectedly high rejection rates have been reported in some studies campinas and rosa 2010 more specifically in addition to hydrogen bonding effects the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged eom and the functional groups of toxins e g the amide group in mcs table 2 is expected to generate larger toxin eom aq assemblages which can be rejected and or adsorbed by mf uf through pathways ii and iii in fig 3 iv rejection and adsorption of aqueous toxins and or toxin assemblages by the cake layer on membranes liu et al 2017 it has been reported that mf uf fouling during the filtration of cyanobacteria laden water in the hc htox scenario is initially governed by pore blocking by algal cells and large mw eom followed by the buildup and compression of a cake layer on the surface due to the continual deposition of cells and aom fig 3 liu et al 2018 pathway iv relates to the secondary effect of membrane fouling in this scenario for instance liu et al 2017 indicated that there was a positive correlation between the reversible resistance of uf membranes and mc lr rejection values r 2 0 95 overall the contaminants in the mf uf concentrate in the hc htox scenario include algal cells with iom and intracellular toxins hpi of eom with large mw i e 20 100 kda and minimal free toxins fig 3 while the rejection of uf membranes for aom and toxin aom aq r 46 98 has been documented table 2 the high cf i e 5 25 at cr 4 10 and concentrations of toxins for example 100 μg toxins l in the concentrate have received limited attention especially among the academic community high algal mass in the uf retentate has been observed in pilot full scale studies but discharge to sewers seems to be a common practice dixon et al 2011 sorlini et al 2013 in addition to the internal recirculation deposition of algal cells and large mw eom largely accounts for the formation of the cake layer and reversible resistance on mf uf membranes babel and takizawa 2010 which results in the loss of membrane permeability but increases the membrane selectivity via pathway iv in fig 3 with the development of the cake layer on mf uf membranes backwashing is frequently applied fig 1 during this process deposited cells aom and toxins are transported from the membrane surface to the waste stream while there has been limited investigation of the nature of toxins in the concentrate and backwashing waste it is expected that intracellular bound toxins are dominant in the concentrate while toxin aom aq and free toxins are likely to be found in the backwashing waste this is because the shear stress of cross flow during filtration causes minimal cell lysis in the bulk solution gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 while the release of intracellular toxins is likely to occur during the compression of the cake layer liu et al 2017 which will be flushed into the backwashing stream the characteristics of the backwashing waste have been analysed in recent studies table 6 while the concentration of organics in the backwashing waste is comparable with the feed the composition is likely different for example the study by li et al 2014 showed that eom with mw higher than 10 kda was substantially found in the backwashing waste compared to eom with mw in the ranges of 0 3 10 kda and 10 300 kda in the feed a similar phenomenon was observed by qu et al 2012b although mf uf is designed for disinfectant free production disinfectants can be found in the backwashing water because either the backwashing water is from the disinfection tank or chemically enhanced backwashing is practical to improve the cleaning efficiency chang et al 2017 zheng et al 2011 ferrer et al 2016 reported that the addition of 7 mg l naocl in the backwashing water could significantly increase the removal of biopolymers from the fouled membrane however due to the reaction between oxidants and aom this method likely results in the presence of aldehydes ketones and highly toxic halogenated byproducts in the backwashing waste it has been reported that the specific disinfection by products yields of anabaena were in the range of 2 11 μmol mmol c for total trihalomethane and 2 17 μmol mmol c for total haloacetic acid huang et al 2009b in addition there are continual requirements to include an engineer s perspective in the scientific research for example the aims of reported studies of backwashing waste have been mainly focused on developing an understanding of reversible fouling on membranes and as such unreasonably high br values 30 90 have been applied li et al 2014 qu et al 2012b chemical cleaning e g cip can be periodically used to remove the residual and irreversible fouling which is related to for example adhesion of metal oxides and hpo of aom on in membranes liao et al 2018 zhang and fu 2018 the typical chemical cleaning protocols used in the hc htox scenario and the composition of the waste are summarised in table 6 acid cleaning e g hcl and hno3 aims at eliminating inorganic metal oxide fouling with proton assisted and double decomposition reactions considered to be the key mechanisms fig 4 a wang et al 2014 it is worthwhile noting that citric acid forms strong solution complexes with metals and the adsorption of citric acid can further weaken the bonds in the proximity of a surface metal ion m center followed by slow detachment of the surface m to solution zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 compared the efficacy of 500 mg l hcl and naoh reagents in chemical cleaning of algal fouled membranes the results of these studies showed that the hcl solution exhibited higher removal of irreversible resistance than naoh with the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc protein and carbohydrate in the chemical waste being 2 10 times of those of the feed zhang et al 2011 however more studies indicate that naoh cleaning is more efficient and neutral fractions dominate in the organic matter in the chemical cleaning waste table 6 under basic conditions large organic matter is expected to be hydrolyzed and solubilized into small aqueous molecules fig 4b naafs and van bergen 2002 yu et al 2013 with the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged membrane surface and aom facilitating the transport of foulants to the bulk solution wang et al 2014 to improve the efficacy of chemical cleaning at high ph oxidative reagents such as naocl are frequently added the major mechanisms relate to the oxidation of the functional groups of aom to ketonic aldehydic and carboxylic groups which consequently increases the hydrophilicity and reduces the adhesion of aom fig 4c wang et al 2014 the residual fouling layer is expected to change into a looser and more open structure wang et al 2018 the study by zhang et al 2011 indicated that 90 recovery of the uf permeability during treatment of algal rich water could be achieved with use of 100 mg l naocl solution though the composition of the waste was not analysed compared with acid and base cleaning oxidant cleaning provides the possibility of also degrading toxins for example the second order rate constant for reaction of chlorine with microcystins is 100 500 m 1s 1 ho et al 2006 nevertheless the oxidative reagent dose is related to the solution matrix i e the mass of the residual foulants after hydraulic cleaning and also influences the distribution of toxins hall et al 2000 indicated that a higher oxidative dose was required for algal toxin mc lr removal when the solution matrix became more complicated i e higher organic matter concentration moreover on exposure to oxidant transformation of intra to extracellular toxins initially occurs due to cell lysis fig 4c hall et al 2000 and zamyadi et al 2012 have observed a temporal increase in extracellular dissolved toxins at lower oxidant dose and or contact time this highlights the concern that cip at insufficient dose of oxidants may generate a more toxic waste stream in the hc htox scenario 3 3 nf concentrate and chemical waste streams in the hc htox scenario nf membranes can be used to polish the mf uf permeate whilst retaining essential minerals salts in the final product dai et al 2019 in the hc htox scenario the rejection mechanism of nf membranes is straightforward in view of their small mwco table 1 teixeira and rosa 2005 as such the proposed pathways of ii size exclusion of toxin aq and iii adsorption of toxin aq are expected to dominate fig 3 gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 investigated the efficacy of the trisep membrane mwco 200 da in rejecting mc rr mc lr mc yr mc la and anatoxin a at concentrations of 1 2 9 4 μg l with the results showing that the permeate concentrations were far below the who guideline value of 1 μg l compared to mf uf nf is also more efficient in removing odor compounds choi et al 2010 investigated the removal of seasonal odor compounds 2 mib long term occurrence in january may and august september and geosmin short term occurrence in july september and march april from the han river water by nf membranes results showed that both loose and tight nf membranes exhibited high rejection r of 98 moreover because mf uf are always implemented prior to nf in practical applications in the hc htox scenario the low mw neutral of hpi should be the dominant component in the nf concentrate it has been shown that in a full scale nanofiltration plant wr app will be 75 i e cr 25 resulting in higher concentrations of low mw neutral and toxins in the concentrate gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 however to the best of our knowledge there has been no investigation of the management of the concentrate and chemical waste in nf treated cyanobacteria laden waters up to date 3 4 ro concentrate and chemical waste streams in the lc and hc htox scenarios ro is the state of the art technology for seawater desalination i e swro while recent attention has been given to innovative solar driven and electrical desalination alternatives ma et al 2016 xia et al 2019 in the lc scenario at least for swro plants located in australia and caribbean coastal areas according to the ro plan distribution map developed by villacorte et al 2015 the cr and cf values are largely related to salt rejection in the past forty years the footprint of swro plants has been significantly reduced because of the continual increase in water recovery from cr 75 in 1980s to cr 40 if a second stage is applied now ghaffour et al 2013 this also creates the opportunity for energy recovery from the concentrate while it is open to question whether water recovery in a single stage can be further increased high water recovery at low pressure has been achieved in swro plants utilizing multi stage operation ahunbay 2019 for the concentrate or brine a critical challenge of swro in the lc scenario however relates to the use of antiscalants e g polyacrylic acid and polymaleic acid to prevent the formation of scale on pumps and membranes typically a dose of 0 5 10 ppm is added to the feed solution depending on the scale forming potential of the feed water wr and manufacturer s recommendations singh 2006 which is then concentrated to 1 20 ppm in the brine khan et al 2009 moreover while there has been substantial progress in development of membrane cleaning protocols and reagents e g naoh and more specific products such as suez kleen mct cleaners and ami acid and alkaline membrane cleaners for ro membranes melián martel et al 2013 little attention has been paid to either the analysis of the composition of the chemical cleaning waste or the sustainable management of the waste missimer and maliva 2018 in regard to the use of conventional primary and secondary pre treatments such as coagulation dissolved air flotation and or mf uf membranes busch et al 2010 in swro systems fig 3 algal cells are unlikely to be detected in the feed of the ro unit even in habs i e in the hc htox scenario with toxins such as saxitoxin and domoic acid present at relatively low concentrations ro membranes can reject toxins via pathways of ii size exclusion of toxin aq and iii adsorption of toxin aq shown in fig 3 even though they are designed for salt removal seubert et al 2012 monitored the temporal concentrations from 2005 to 2009 of saxitoxin domoic acid brevetoxin and okadaic acid within the intake and in desalinated water from a pilot ro desalination plant in el segundo ca results showed that while saxitoxin and domoic acid were occasionally found in the intake waters all toxins were not detected in the desalinated water seubert et al 2012 full removal 99 of saxitoxin brevetoxin and domoic acid has been shown to be achieved even at elevated source water concentrations in lab scale studies laycock et al 2012 seubert et al 2012 from published literature li et al 2016 schurer et al 2012 2013 villacorte et al 2015 it is expected that the transport of algal cells aom and toxins to the concentrate and waste streams in the mf uf pretreatment units should be similar to that in drinking water treatment fig 3 though the species present will be significantly different table 2 of particular note is that transparent exopolymer particles teps have been recognised as a fouling indicator in swro but not in drinking water treatment though they are ubiquitous in marine and freshwater environments bar zeev et al 2015 teps can be further specified as particulate tep ptep particle size 0 4 μm and colloidal tep ctep 0 05 μm particle size 0 4 μm in the membrane field villacorte et al 2009 ctep can pass through uf membranes and will accumulate in the ro concentrate ro is capable of retaining if any toxins and ctep present in the feed solution i e uf permeate which however results in their accumulation in the concentrate and chemical waste this can be challenging for decontamination and discharge because the abundant chloride ions in swro concentrate are a well known scavenger for various strong oxidants e g hydroxyl radicals 4 opportunities and perspectives for management of concentrate and waste streams following review of the characteristics of concentrate and waste streams in lc and hc htox scenarios we will identify the opportunities and perspectives for their management in regard to the cost and feasibility of management in existing plants current strategies typically employ coagulation adsorption chemical oxidation or disinfection and energy conversion processes fig 2b which aim at i increasing the overall water recovery ii beneficial use of the concentrate and or iii decontamination of the concentrate and waste streams guidance and perspectives for future studies will be discussed in an eisenhower framework 4 1 opportunities for management of concentrate and waste streams 4 1 1 recycling of mf uf concentrate to increase the water recovery in the lc scenario instead of direct discharge of concentrate and waste streams into sewers one may consider either installing a secondary mf uf unit to recover the waste or blend the waste with the raw water to the main mf uf process gora and walsh 2011 zeman and zydney 2017 although the concentrate and backwashing waste are significantly different in their characteristics section 3 2 and table 4 these two streams are often combined in the lc scenario with the combined stream accounting for approximately 5 10 of the feed volume cr tot 5 10 in view of the high cf values of the concentrate waste with respect to turbidity 20 at c f of 1 3 ntu and total organic carbon 10 at c f of 2 4 mg l but low cf values for doc 1 2 at c f of 2 4 mg l coagulation can be applied fig 2 gora and walsh 2011 reported that a dose of 5 10 mg l of alum aluminium sulphate or aluminium chlorohydrate was sufficient for removing doc by 20 50 and uv254 by 65 80 blending of the combined concentrate cr tot 10 with the raw water can likely improve the removal efficiency of doc uv254 and true color gora and walsh 2011 moreover coagulation may benefit the membrane operation in the subsequent filtration step strong flocs with low distribution spreading index in the feed solution of mf uf are expected to lower the specific cake resistance for these membranes huang et al 2011 4 1 2 beneficial use of ro concentrate in the lc scenario there has been some discussion on possible alternatives to the management of desalination brine i e the concentrate from swro plants such as use for establishment of solar ponds for thermal energy and electricity production and use of the salts through the chlor alkali process khan et al 2009 the hydraulic energy associated with the concentrate due to the high pressure operation of the ro unit is recoverable via either a direct route to pressurise the feed to ro or an indirect route to drive a turbine gude 2011 typically energy recovery devices erds include pelton turbine centrifugal type turbocharger centrifugal type and isobaric erd positive displacement type fig 2b stover 2007 the isobaric erds demonstrate higher energy recovery efficiency 95 97 than the centrifugal types i e pelton turbine 87 and turbocharger 85 though the latter is now more widely used in swro as a result of their mechanical simplicity and operational flexibility gude 2011 another interesting opportunity relates to the use of the chemical potential known as salinity power of the high salinity concentrate logan and elimelech 2012 she et al 2012 for example the energy present as a result of the salinity difference can be recovered as a hydraulic pressure that can be used to spin a turbine in the pressure retarded osmosis pro process she et al 2012 at the same time the brine after pro treatment is diluted to prevent the formation of a density plume during its discharge prante et al 2014 thermodynamic and thermo economic analyses indicated that the integration of pro with swro can reduce the energy consumption of desalination by 40 prante et al 2014 sharqawy et al 2011 alternatively there has been increasing interest in development of electrochemical processes e g reverse electrodialysis mei and tang 2017 mei and tang 2018 to recover the salinity power of the concentrate nevertheless both pro and electrochemical processes are still too expensive for full scale implementation due to their relatively low power density in addition to membrane fouling and stability issues the beneficial use of membrane chemical cleaning waste is generally difficult because of i the relatively small volume generated 3 5 times per year and ii the very complex composition e g citric acid and edta at higher concentrations compared to antiscalants in the concentrate while chemical cleaning waste in swro plants is usually disposed to sanitary sewers khan et al 2009 more work is needed to better characterise the nature of the waste streams and subsequently their potential environmental impacts 4 1 3 decontamination of mf uf concentrate and waste streams in the hc htox scenario in the hc htox scenario recycling of the mf uf concentrate i e a combined stream of the concentrate and the backwashing and forward flushing waste with a typical cr of 10 to the pretreatment units has been considered fig 2b the concentrations of algal cells aoms and total toxins are similar or lower than those in the feed water e g typical values of 106 107 cell ml 5 mg doc l and 1 20 μg l considering the dilution by backwashing waste conventional flocculants including aluminum salts polyacrylamide or chitosan can form larger aggregates that largely remove algal cells and intracellular toxins and toxin aom aq in the concentrate dixon et al 2011 coagulation removes 95 99 of algal cells and intracellular toxins and 20 50 of doc with an alum dose of 5 20 mg l gora and walsh 2011 prior to clarification a powdered activated carbon pac dose of typically 5 25 mg l can be applied to remove free toxins e g 50 60 removal of 22 μg anatoxin a l at a 5 mg l pac dose and 90 removal of 10 μg anatoxin a l at a 11 mg l pac dose vlad et al 2014 the combined use of pac with coagulants can further improve the removal of cyanobacteria and intracellular toxins such as anabaena microcystis and pseudanabaena to 99 99 9 zamyadi et al 2013 which avoids the accumulation of algal cells in the concentrate during internal recycling however this practice results in elevated algal cell numbers and toxin concentrations in the clarifier fig 2b if the chemical sludge is not properly managed breakthrough of cells and toxins in the effluent may occur zamyadi et al 2012 in order to reduce the final discharge of algal cells and toxins into the environment in the hc htox scenario there has been increasing interest to integrate oxidation with membrane based algal separation although most studies focus primarily on membrane fouling control rather than the management of the concentrate liu et al 2017 ma et al 2018 chlorine based oxidants chlorine chloramine and chlorine dioxide are commonly used reagents to oxidize cyanobacteria and toxins while chlorine has reasonable activities for microcystins e g k app of 100 500 m 1s 1 ho et al 2006 and cylindrospermopsin very low rate constants 1 m 1 s 1 have been observed for anatoxin a vlad et al 2014 in comparison ozone permanganate and hydroxyl radicals show higher activities for microcystins anatoxin a and cylindrospermopsin despite the low second order rate constant for cylindrospermopsin oxidation with permanganate 1 m 1 s 1 the efficacy of the oxidants is significantly influenced by the water matrix for example higher aom content in the feed will result in strong scavenging effects in addition the use of ozone and permanganate can induce cell lysis that causes the transformation of intracellular toxins to extracellular or free toxins hall et al 2000 to mitigate this problem the oxidation unit can be placed after the coagulation and clarification unit fig 2b so that the influent algal cell and aom concentrations are minimized the dose of oxidant is usually determined by the organic matter concentration e g 0 1 0 5 mg o3 kmno4 per mg doc at a typical contact time of 30 min rather than by the toxin concentration naceradska et al 2017 vlad et al 2014 because of the competition of aom over low abundant toxins for oxidants e g k ho doc 3 6 108 m 1 s 1 and k ho mc lr 2 3 1010 m 1 s 1 with two orders of magnitude difference in first order rate constants song et al 2009 westerhoff et al 1999 this strategy would nevertheless increase the cost of chemicals considering the much smaller volume of the combined concentrate i e 10 compared to the feed solution the oxidation unit may be alternatively included in the recycling loop fig 2b pre oxidation prior to coagulation may offer some benefits for example naceradska et al 2017 found that permanganate is capable of preventing the formation of fe peptide protein complexes that inhibit coagulation with the adsorption of organic matter onto the hydrous mno2 generated improving the efficiency of the following coagulation step essentially the challenge relating to the reuse of the concentrate in the hc htox scenario compared to that in the lc scenario is contributed by the algal concentration in the raw water with source reduction of the intake gaining in popularity fig 2b for instance a patented flowing g c3n4 photocatalyst capable of inactivating m aeruginosa under solar irradiation in contained cyanobacteria laden water has been developed by song et al 2018b results showed that up to 90 removal and degradation of m aeruginosa at an initial concentration of 2 7 106 cells ml can be achieved under 6 h of irradiation at a catalyst dose of 2 g l cell lysis occurs mainly as a result of the attack of ho and h generated on the semiconductor surface the intracellular and extracellular mc lr is further degraded by the oxidation of the adda chain song et al 2018a 2018b 4 1 4 critical pretreatment for ro in the hc htox scenario for swro plants in the hc htox scenario the potentially beneficial use of the concentrate largely relies on the mf uf pretreatment unit i e reduction from the feed because i the high rejection of ro membranes will result in the accumulation of toxins in the concentrate and ii decontamination of the concentrate at large volume is not cost effective in view of the scavenging effect of the complicated matrix while the efficacy of ozonation is less affected by chloride ions more toxic byproducts can be formed in the presence of bromide vlad et al 2014 at the same time best practice with respect to solid reuse of the concentrate is under open discussion fig 2b more studies are required to understand the relationship between the presence of toxins and at what level in the concentrate and contamination of the salts in the chlor alkali industry 4 2 perspectives for management of concentrate and waste streams fig 5 summarises the relative state of knowledge and importance of topics discussed in this review paper overall there have been numerous studies on the removal of algae aom and toxins and odor compounds by membrane separation adsorption and oxidation in pure water or simple matrices such that these topics deserve low priority in future research lower right quadrant of fig 5 in comparison more studies are needed on the impacts of membrane permeability and selectivity on the transport of aom and toxins in membrane based algal separation especially at pilot scale with realistic water matrices see issues of ongoing concern upper right quadrant of fig 5 for example the incorporation of hydrophilic metal organic frameworks into the membrane matrix has been investigated to create selective nanochannels for enhancing the rejection of micropollutants dai et al 2019 results of the relevant studies have facilitated the construction of nanochannels with specific characteristics e g charge density and terminal functional groups capable of improving the water flux decreasing cr whilst achieving selective removal of low abundant compounds e g toxins and odor compounds currently there is limited investigation on the formation and control of byproducts when the backwashing water contains disinfectants as such this issue requires ongoing attention in future studies upper right quadrant of fig 5 as previously mentioned in section 4 1 there is a lack of studies on the disposal of chemical waste generated from membrane cleaning in the hc htox scenario the widespread practice of discharge to the sewers can cause critical problems due to the presence of toxins in the chemical waste fig 2 also the reaction of algal cells aom and toxins with chlorine likely results in the formation of highly toxic byproducts huang et al 2009b which has been rarely considered in past studies as such priority should be given to the better understanding and monitoring e g through on line electrochemical sensors zhang et al 2019 of the secondary pollution that may be generated during the disposal of the waste streams in the hc htox scenario similar importance is assigned to the management of the chemical sludge from the pretreatment step such as coagulation of the feed solution and recycling of the concentrate upper left quadrant of fig 5 while adsorption followed by oxidation is very efficient in regenerating the concentrate critical challenges remain in regard to the low selectivity of the target pollutants e g toxins that are present at much lower concentrations than the bulk natural organic matter e g at μg l level compared to doc at mg l level these needs call for novel methods for management of the membrane concentrate in drinking water treatment upper left quadrant of fig 5 in this regard design of heterogeneous aops with the catalysts electrodes capable of selective uptake of target pollutants to the interface followed by oxidation chen et al 2020 offers more opportunity for the future however research in this field is still in its infancy in addition areas requiring additional research include the need for development of composite membranes and new desalination technologies for minimal generation of concentrate e g spatially isolating salt crystallisation from water evaporation as described by xia et al 2019 lower left quadrant of fig 5 magnéli phase titanium suboxide ti4o7 has the ability to be used in the preparation of reactive electrochemical membranes that enables fine filtration whilst oxidising the pollutants deposited on the membrane surface chaplin 2014 this strategy is conducive to decreasing the br of the backwashing waste long term evaluation and economic and life cycle analyses of these alternatives will be invaluable in identifying viable low cost processes for better management of the concentrate and waste streams for membrane based algal separation in water treatment and desalination 5 conclusions in this paper recent research advances in relation to the management of concentrate and waste streams from membrane based algal separation processes have been reviewed from the viewpoint of the characteristics of membranes e g mwco concentrate and waste streams e g concentrations of algal cells aom and toxins as well as cr and cf two scenarios i drinking water production desalination at low algal concentrations and ii cyanobacteria laden water treatment desalination are comprehensively discussed a summary of the fate of algal cells and metabolites in membrane processes facilitates the understanding of the impacts of these transformations on the composition of concentrate and waste streams current strategies are updated in regard to i recycling of mf uf concentrate and beneficial use of ro concentrate in the lc scenario and ii decontamination of mf uf concentrate and wastes and pretreatment for ro feed in the hc htox scenario identification of the knowledge gap thereby provides insights to future studies of for example increasing the low pressure membrane rejection of toxins and management of the generation of secondary pollutants in backwashing and chemical cleaning wastes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

17727,frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms habs and red tides in freshwater and seawater poses serious threats to water treatment and drives the application of membrane based technologies in

challenge in this paper we review the scenarios under which membrane based processes are integrated with algal separation with particular attention given to i drinking water production and desalination at low algal concentrations and ii cyanobacteria laden water treatment desalination the concentrate and waste streams from backwashing and membrane cleaning in each scenario are characterised with this information facilitating a better understanding of the transport of algal cells and metabolites in membrane processes current strategies and gaps in managing concentrate and

microalgae are an extremely large and diverse group of organisms and include both prokaryotes and eukaryotes capable of photosynthesis they are critical to the aquatic ecosystem and the biosphere for oxygen production and carbon fixation rai et al 2000 however their excessive growth in some natural environments such as commonly occurring in eutrophic or polluted water bodies can result in severe oxygen depletion and damage to the aquatic habitats loza et al 2014 certain microalgae e g microcystis aeruginosa can produce toxins which pose a threat to public health through either drinking contaminated water or consumption of food that has been processed with contaminated water caron et al 2010 song et al 2018b westrick 2008 for example microcystin lr mc lr with amino acids leucine l and arginine r at positions 2 and 4 respectively has been listed as one of the most potent water toxins in the united states greer et al 2018 due to their frequent occurrence often at elevated concentrations algal removal from affected source waters at high efficiency and low cost is of great practical importance conventional technologies applied for algal treatment include coagulation centrifugation dissolved air flotation chemical oxidation i e disinfection and pre oxidation and filtration christenson and sims 2011 henderson et al 2008a naceradska et al 2017 despite substantial progress achieved with these methods critical challenges remain for example coagulation the most common water treatment method can partially remove algal cells but has low efficiency against soluble algal toxins ghernaout et al 2010 centrifugation is considered to be one of the most effective separation methods but the high shear force produced in this energy intensive process can easily damage the cell membrane resulting in the release of algal toxins chen et al 2011 christenson and sims 2011 while dissolved air flotation of algal cells is attractive in view of its low operating cost the presence of chemicals to aid this process raises other problems such as disposal of the chemical sludge granados et al 2012 additionally chemical oxidation may result in the generation of secondary pollutants for example it has been reported that chloramination of waters containing organics at elevated concentrations likely leads to the formation of harmful by products such as trihalomethanes and n nitrosodimethylamine furst et al 2018 in recent years membrane based processes have gained increasing popularity as a means of algal separation as a result of their high separation efficiency and low footprint liu et al 2017 microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro have particular benefits for algal separation because they can achieve complete retention of algal cells and at least for the smaller pore sized membranes remarkable removal of solutes e g organic matter and toxins bilad et al 2014 teixeira and rosa 2005 following the early trial by koseoglu and batchelor 1993 of use of membrane processes for algae retention and the first systematic study of algae removal from source waters using membranes by chow et al 1997 the continual improvement in membrane materials and optimization of operating parameters has made this method competitive in terms of both cost and effectiveness compared to centrifugation bilad et al 2012 nevertheless membrane based algal separation faces two major drawbacks i membrane fouling which leads to a notable decrease in membrane permeability heng et al 2008 hung and liu 2006 zhang et al 2013a and consequently the need for frequent cleaning and maintenance judd 2016 wang et al 2014 and ii the need for management of concentrate and waste streams that may contain cells and toxins at much high levels investigation of the algal induced membrane fouling mechanism and associated control strategies has become an important research topic which has been addressed by a number of research groups liu et al 2017 qu et al 2012a villacorte et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 there are also comprehensive review papers on recent achievements and opportunities in membrane materials and processes for algal separation liao et al 2018 luo et al 2017 zhang and fu 2018 nevertheless a systematic overview of the management and treatment methods for the concentrate and waste streams is not yet available which prompts us to provide a comprehensive review on this important topic essentially the volume ratio and composition of the concentrate and waste streams is largely determined by the choice of membrane processes in water treatment khan et al 2009 van der bruggen et al 2003 as well as the algal and toxin concentrations and the salinity of the feed solution liu et al 2017 schurer et al 2013 as such we have based this review paper around two scenarios in which membrane based processes are integrated with algal separation i drinking water production and desalination at low algal concentrations and ii cyanobacteria laden water treatment especially under seasonal cyanobacterial blooms the gaps in knowledge with regard to managing concentrate and waste streams generated from backwashing and membrane cleaning are identified and guidance and perspectives for future studies in membrane based algal separation for water treatment are provided 2 classification of membranes and scenarios in algal separation in this section we will introduce the membranes used for algal separation and the streams i e the permeate concentrate and waste streams generated during the filtration the application scenarios are classified into two categories i e i drinking water production and desalination at low algal concentrations and ii cyanobacteria laden water treatment with their characteristics discussed individually 2 1 membranes table 1 summarises commonly used membranes for algal separation specifically mf and uf are low pressure membranes with their pore sizes smaller than microalgae cells these porous pressure driven membranes can be used to address habs in surface waters huang et al 2009a or to pretreat the feed stream to ro in seawater desalination villacorte et al 2015 compared to their low pressure counterparts ro and nf have smaller molecular weight cut off mwco table 1 but require substantially higher pressure high pressure membranes are not expected to be directly used for algal separation e g red tides during ro based seawater desalination because of the severe membrane fouling and high operating cost that would result nevertheless issues related to the retention of dissolved organic matter and toxins if any in the feed to ro and nf must still be addressed seubert et al 2012 considering that algal sizes are at the micrometer scale e g m aeruginosa 3 0 7 0 μm chlorella sp 3 0 8 0 μm and alexandrium tamrensis 20 42 μm granéli and turner 2006 all aforementioned membranes table 1 are capable of rejecting algal cells by size exclusion in comparison mwco governs the retention of dissolved organic matter toxins and algae derived odor compounds e g 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib and geosmin with much smaller size for a typical membrane process the feed solution is separated into two streams as a result of treatment fig 1 the product water permeating through the membrane i e the permeate and the rejected water containing concentrated contaminants i e the concentrate to mitigate membrane fouling backwashing for the case of porous membranes and chemical cleaning are often utilised wang et al 2014 with these processes generating additional waste streams in order to elucidate the challenges for management of the concentrate and waste streams in a more systematic manner we consider two major application scenarios i drinking water production and desalination at low algal toxin concentrations low concentration lc and ii cyanobacteria laden water treatment desalination high concentration and high toxicity hc htox fig 1 it is worthwhile noting that the composition of the feed solution to the membrane process may differ substantially from that of the raw water due to the presence of pre treatment processes such as coagulation and sedimentation furthermore the composition of the concentrate and waste streams is affected by the type of membrane operation and chemicals used if any which could differ substantially for low mf and uf and high pressure nf and ro membrane processes therefore under each scenario low and high pressure membrane processes are discussed separately 2 2 lc scenario drinking water production and desalination at low algal concentrations this is the most common scenario for drinking water production from surface water treatment with typical feed salinity 500 mg l and seawater desalination salinity typically 35 g l using membrane technologies in this scenario the algal and toxin concentration in source waters is relatively low for example the green algae alert by waternsw australia according to the national health and medical research council is 500 cells ml of m aeruginosa for fresh water or 10 cells ml of karenia brevis for coastal water nhmrc 2008 and the world health organization guideline for mc lr in fresh water is 1 μg l sikka and hellstrom 2017 implementation of conventional processes such as coagulation and activated carbon adsorption generally meets the standards for turbidity and heavy metals fig 2 a membrane based technologies are capable of polishing the effluent by removal of residual colloidal matter and or dissolved solutes table 1 in this case algal cells may be occasionally involved in membrane fouling and algal organic matter aom typically contributes only a small portion of the membrane foulant despite the low concentrations of algal toxins in the lc scenario the concentrate and backwashing streams are expected to contain much more organic matter compared to the feed solution as such the 10 recycling rule i e the recycle flow 10 of the raw water flow has been implemented by the us environmental protection agency epa 2002 in general there are few challenges with regard to disinfection and management of the outfalls for the discharge of mf uf concentrate and backwashing streams into the environment however the discharge of ro concentrate back to seawater can result in critical issues such as the generation of a dense plume that sinks to the seafloor and disrupts marine communities pérez gonzález et al 2012 though it is now recognised that the implementation of an appropriately designed diffusion device would largely avoid the adverse impacts missimer and maliva 2018 2 3 hc htox scenario cyanobacteria laden water treatment desalination this scenario is applicable to the treatment of source waters during seasonal cyanobacterial blooms table 2 summarises the characteristics of algae and toxins in cyanobacteria laden waters numerous studies have reported that paralytic shellfish poisoning and cyanobacterial toxin poisoning can pose great threats to human health for example the toxicology of paralytic shellfish poisoning by alexandrium sp in red tide blooms is similar to that of tetrodotoxin etheridge 2010 uptake of more than 80 μg of saxitoxin to 100 g of tissue may lead to death in severe cases table 2 etheridge 2010 cyanobacterial toxin poisoning mainly occurs in freshwater areas where ingestion of toxin contaminated water is more likely westrick 2008 among the various habs in the hc htox scenario m aeruginosa and anabaena flos aquae are particularly widely distributed hazardous species m aeruginosa can produce the most widely distributed hepatotoxin microcystin mc granéli and turner 2006 mcs have a strong resistance to proteolytic enzymes with over 70 variants found e g mc lr mc ar and mc yr carmichael 1992 according to national health and medical research council guidelines nhmrc 2008 the alert for a hc htox scenario is raised when 50 000 cells ml of m aeruginosa are present or a biovolume of all toxin producing cyanobacteria exceeds 4 mm3 l or 10 mm3 l for all algae in fresh water while 10 cells ml of karenia brevis is applied for coastal water the high abundance of cyanobacteria at these alert levels would lead to a concentration of total microcystins 10 μg l nhmrc 2008 in spring 2007 a cyanobacteria bloom covered almost one third of taihu lake which directly led to restriction of water supplies for around 5 million residents of wuxi city in china li et al 2011 moreover although neither 2 mib nor geosmin the typical algal odor compounds has any known adverse biological or pathological effects giglio et al 2011 a level of 10 ng l in water at habs is considered to be above the taste and smell threshold reynolds 2010 table 2 likewise non toxic algal blooms will not necessarily lead to serious health issues but may result in deterioration of aquatic habitats and water quality via generation of mucilage and or transparent exopolymer particles teps bar zeev et al 2015 gotsis skretas 1995 hamilton et al 2005 due to the relatively high algal concentration and the possibility that the source waters exhibit high toxicity and unpleasant odor the efficiency of pretreatment processes such as coagulation is typically compromised more importantly the removal of dissolved toxins and odor compounds likely requires additional chemical oxidation steps fig 2a although membrane based separation can be integrated to improve process performance table 1 it results in the accumulation of algal cells and toxins in the concentrate the backwashing waste in the hc htox scenario becomes more difficult to deal with fig 1 because of the release of algal cells and organic matter and toxins from the cake layer li et al 2014 in practical processes the backwashing water is alternatively from the disinfection tank and the secondary byproducts e g aldehydes ketones and halogenated byproducts from the reaction of aom and disinfectants would be contained in backwashing waste in comparison the composition and toxicity of the waste stream from chemical cleaning are strongly influenced by the chemical reagents and the dose used with the possibility of generation of other products from reactions with the cleaning reagents wang et al 2014 while the use of oxidants can degrade a portion of the dissolved toxins this practice can damage cell integrity and result in the massive release of intracellular toxins hall et al 2000 zamyadi et al 2012 into the chemical waste 3 concentrate and waste streams in lc and hc htox scenarios this section is focused on the review of concentrate and waste streams in the established lc and hc htox scenarios standardisation of the basic characteristics e g volume ratio and concentration factor is provided and detailed assessment of these characteristics is provided for mf uf nf and ro in lc and hc htox scenarios particular attention is paid to the transformations of aom toxins and odor compounds during filtration and the impacts of these transformations on the composition of concentrate and waste streams 3 1 basic characteristics of the concentrate and waste streams concentrate in this review paper the concentrate represents either i the retentate stream in cross flow or semi dead end operation of mf uf zeman and zydney 2017 or ii the retentate stream and the intermediate forward flushing stream in cross flow operation of nf ro pérez gonzález et al 2012 fig 1 as forward flushing is usually conducted during desalination i e during the generation of the retentate the volume of the nf ro concentrate is made up of the sum of the retentate and forward flushing streams the concentrate to feed solution volume ratio cr is related to the apparent water recovery wr app i e the permeate to feed solution volume ratio by eq 1 in table 3 van der bruggen et al 2003 typically the cr is 1 10 for mf epa 2002 and uf 15 30 for nf and 15 60 for ro khan et al 2009 assuming that the mass loss due to fouling is minimal compared to the mass in the feed concentrate and permeate the concentration factor cf defined as the concentration ratio of concentrate over the feed solution c c i c f i can be obtained by an overall mass balance eq 2 in table 3 greenlee et al 2009 the rejection of all membranes for algal cells is close to 1 i e cf 1 cr determination of the rejection and cf for aom toxins and odor compounds is more complicated and will be discussed in section 3 2 backwashing waste in membrane based algal separation hydraulic cleaning such as backwashing is always used for porous membranes e g mf uf to remove the physically reversible fouling and to restore the permeability ferrer et al 2016 this cleaning process generates a backwashing waste stream fig 1 the backwashing to feed solution volume ratio br is determined by the backwashing tmp δp bw t backwashing duration bw d min and backwashing frequency bw f time per min eqs 3 and 4 in table 3 ferrer et al 2016 wang et al 2014 an empirical flow ratio of 0 8 1 2 can be applied to q bw q f with br values of 5 15 documented in some published papers chew et al 2016 oh et al 2006 as such the wr app eq 1 should be adjusted to wr adj 1 cr br in comparison estimation of the concentration factor for the backwashing waste is challenging because it depends on various operating parameters such as the total mass of the cake layer the portion released and the source of the backwashing water it is easier to directly measure the concentration of constituents e g algal cells aom and toxins in the backwashing waste chemical cleaning waste chemical cleaning typically known as cleaning in place cip shi et al 2014 wang et al 2014 removes scale organic fouling and biofouling and results in a chemical waste stream the volume and volume ratio of this stream is small 1 especially in the lc scenario compared to cr and br though the composition is more complex and depends on the chemicals added such as citric acid and edta for scale removal and naocl for organic fouling and biofouling removal villacorte et al 2015 wang et al 2010 moreover consideration should be given to the presence of high concentrations of coexisting ions e g na and cl in seawater in addition to the residual chemicals 3 2 mf uf concentrate and waste streams in lc and hc htox scenarios mf uf is increasingly used in disinfectant free production and distribution of drinking water schurer et al 2019 particularly given the good performance of uf in rejecting high mw organic carbon that plays an active role in the regrowth of aeromonads hijnen et al 2018 the mf uf concentrate is typically termed a recirculation loop stream because this is the general practice for concentrate processing in an mf uf system as such cr is rarely discussed in the lc scenario though the resultant organic concentrations in the recirculation loop can be as high as 100 mg carbon l but still lower than the recommended criteria of 600 mg carbon l oh et al 2006 in pilot tests backwashing is conducted every 20 30 min i e bw f 1 20 1 30 per min with a bw d of 0 5 min and δp bw t 0 2 mpa as summarised in table 4 the br value for the lc scenario is generally 5 it has been suggested that a combined concentrate and backwashing stream should follow the 10 recycling rule epa 2002 i e cr br 10 nevertheless an industrial scale study by chew et al 2016 showed that the percentage of water losses by combined pretreatment and backwashing in a uf system 11 could be roughly double that of a conventional media filtration system compared with the relatively dilute backwashing waste the concentration of the chemical cleaning waste based on total organic carbon can be 1 2 orders of magnitudes higher oh et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 it is worthwhile noting that current studies of the small volume chemical waste volume ratio 1 table 4 is largely related to improving our understanding of the membrane foulant components that are resistant to hydraulic cleaning wang et al 2010 rather than investigation of suitable methods for disposal of the chemical waste in hc htox the rejection of mf uf membranes for algal cells is close to 1 with cell deposition insignificantly affecting the mass balance cf for algal cells in the concentrate is therefore around 10 100 in comparison the composition of aom and toxins in the concentrate and waste streams is related to the membrane rejection and then backwashing and cleaning mechanism note that since odor compounds have comparable mw with small toxins their removal by mf uf membranes should occur in a similar manner and will not be discussed separately considering that the mwco of mf uf table 1 is typically larger than the mw of algal toxins e g 165 2 da of anatoxin a in table 2 four pathways can be proposed for the mechanism of removal of these toxins fig 3 i size exclusion of intracellular cell bound toxins in the hc htox scenario the rejection of toxins by mf uf largely depends on the cell integrity because algal toxins are originally intracellular minimal cell breakage 2 5 has been found during uf filtration resulting in pathway i in fig 3 accounting for over 95 rejection of toxins gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 liu et al 2017 ii size exclusion and iii adsorption of aqueous toxin assemblages i e toxin aom aq by membranes lee and walker 2008 aom can be classified into two groups those remaining inside cells and referred to as intracellular organic matter iom and those secreted into the solution and referred to as extracellular organic matter eom zhou et al 2014 since iom is inside algal cells with minimal amount released into the bulk solution due to the cell lysis fig 3 eom is expected to dominate the interaction between aom and the aqueous toxin as such the fate of eom and its active role in toxin rejection i e rejection of toxin eom aq should be taken into account in pathways ii and iii table 5 classifies the characteristics of eom of representative algal species e g m aeruginosa blooms in fresh water and chaetoceros muelleri in coastal water most organics in eom are hydrophilic with the hydrophilic fraction hpi accounting for 60 table 5 while the hydrophobic fraction hpo is present at lower abundance the mw distribution of eom is quite wide for instance the mw of eom of the representative algal species except for asterionella formosa henderson et al 2008b is divided into two size regions that is 30 60 20 100 kda an mwco for biopolymers and 40 60 1 kda an mwco for humics table 5 these findings are generally in accord with the rejection 50 of eom by mf uf membranes li et al 2014 although the hydrophilicity of toxins and the relatively large mwco of uf membranes are expected to lead to lower rejection unexpectedly high rejection rates have been reported in some studies campinas and rosa 2010 more specifically in addition to hydrogen bonding effects the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged eom and the functional groups of toxins e g the amide group in mcs table 2 is expected to generate larger toxin eom aq assemblages which can be rejected and or adsorbed by mf uf through pathways ii and iii in fig 3 iv rejection and adsorption of aqueous toxins and or toxin assemblages by the cake layer on membranes liu et al 2017 it has been reported that mf uf fouling during the filtration of cyanobacteria laden water in the hc htox scenario is initially governed by pore blocking by algal cells and large mw eom followed by the buildup and compression of a cake layer on the surface due to the continual deposition of cells and aom fig 3 liu et al 2018 pathway iv relates to the secondary effect of membrane fouling in this scenario for instance liu et al 2017 indicated that there was a positive correlation between the reversible resistance of uf membranes and mc lr rejection values r 2 0 95 overall the contaminants in the mf uf concentrate in the hc htox scenario include algal cells with iom and intracellular toxins hpi of eom with large mw i e 20 100 kda and minimal free toxins fig 3 while the rejection of uf membranes for aom and toxin aom aq r 46 98 has been documented table 2 the high cf i e 5 25 at cr 4 10 and concentrations of toxins for example 100 μg toxins l in the concentrate have received limited attention especially among the academic community high algal mass in the uf retentate has been observed in pilot full scale studies but discharge to sewers seems to be a common practice dixon et al 2011 sorlini et al 2013 in addition to the internal recirculation deposition of algal cells and large mw eom largely accounts for the formation of the cake layer and reversible resistance on mf uf membranes babel and takizawa 2010 which results in the loss of membrane permeability but increases the membrane selectivity via pathway iv in fig 3 with the development of the cake layer on mf uf membranes backwashing is frequently applied fig 1 during this process deposited cells aom and toxins are transported from the membrane surface to the waste stream while there has been limited investigation of the nature of toxins in the concentrate and backwashing waste it is expected that intracellular bound toxins are dominant in the concentrate while toxin aom aq and free toxins are likely to be found in the backwashing waste this is because the shear stress of cross flow during filtration causes minimal cell lysis in the bulk solution gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 while the release of intracellular toxins is likely to occur during the compression of the cake layer liu et al 2017 which will be flushed into the backwashing stream the characteristics of the backwashing waste have been analysed in recent studies table 6 while the concentration of organics in the backwashing waste is comparable with the feed the composition is likely different for example the study by li et al 2014 showed that eom with mw higher than 10 kda was substantially found in the backwashing waste compared to eom with mw in the ranges of 0 3 10 kda and 10 300 kda in the feed a similar phenomenon was observed by qu et al 2012b although mf uf is designed for disinfectant free production disinfectants can be found in the backwashing water because either the backwashing water is from the disinfection tank or chemically enhanced backwashing is practical to improve the cleaning efficiency chang et al 2017 zheng et al 2011 ferrer et al 2016 reported that the addition of 7 mg l naocl in the backwashing water could significantly increase the removal of biopolymers from the fouled membrane however due to the reaction between oxidants and aom this method likely results in the presence of aldehydes ketones and highly toxic halogenated byproducts in the backwashing waste it has been reported that the specific disinfection by products yields of anabaena were in the range of 2 11 μmol mmol c for total trihalomethane and 2 17 μmol mmol c for total haloacetic acid huang et al 2009b in addition there are continual requirements to include an engineer s perspective in the scientific research for example the aims of reported studies of backwashing waste have been mainly focused on developing an understanding of reversible fouling on membranes and as such unreasonably high br values 30 90 have been applied li et al 2014 qu et al 2012b chemical cleaning e g cip can be periodically used to remove the residual and irreversible fouling which is related to for example adhesion of metal oxides and hpo of aom on in membranes liao et al 2018 zhang and fu 2018 the typical chemical cleaning protocols used in the hc htox scenario and the composition of the waste are summarised in table 6 acid cleaning e g hcl and hno3 aims at eliminating inorganic metal oxide fouling with proton assisted and double decomposition reactions considered to be the key mechanisms fig 4 a wang et al 2014 it is worthwhile noting that citric acid forms strong solution complexes with metals and the adsorption of citric acid can further weaken the bonds in the proximity of a surface metal ion m center followed by slow detachment of the surface m to solution zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 compared the efficacy of 500 mg l hcl and naoh reagents in chemical cleaning of algal fouled membranes the results of these studies showed that the hcl solution exhibited higher removal of irreversible resistance than naoh with the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc protein and carbohydrate in the chemical waste being 2 10 times of those of the feed zhang et al 2011 however more studies indicate that naoh cleaning is more efficient and neutral fractions dominate in the organic matter in the chemical cleaning waste table 6 under basic conditions large organic matter is expected to be hydrolyzed and solubilized into small aqueous molecules fig 4b naafs and van bergen 2002 yu et al 2013 with the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged membrane surface and aom facilitating the transport of foulants to the bulk solution wang et al 2014 to improve the efficacy of chemical cleaning at high ph oxidative reagents such as naocl are frequently added the major mechanisms relate to the oxidation of the functional groups of aom to ketonic aldehydic and carboxylic groups which consequently increases the hydrophilicity and reduces the adhesion of aom fig 4c wang et al 2014 the residual fouling layer is expected to change into a looser and more open structure wang et al 2018 the study by zhang et al 2011 indicated that 90 recovery of the uf permeability during treatment of algal rich water could be achieved with use of 100 mg l naocl solution though the composition of the waste was not analysed compared with acid and base cleaning oxidant cleaning provides the possibility of also degrading toxins for example the second order rate constant for reaction of chlorine with microcystins is 100 500 m 1s 1 ho et al 2006 nevertheless the oxidative reagent dose is related to the solution matrix i e the mass of the residual foulants after hydraulic cleaning and also influences the distribution of toxins hall et al 2000 indicated that a higher oxidative dose was required for algal toxin mc lr removal when the solution matrix became more complicated i e higher organic matter concentration moreover on exposure to oxidant transformation of intra to extracellular toxins initially occurs due to cell lysis fig 4c hall et al 2000 and zamyadi et al 2012 have observed a temporal increase in extracellular dissolved toxins at lower oxidant dose and or contact time this highlights the concern that cip at insufficient dose of oxidants may generate a more toxic waste stream in the hc htox scenario 3 3 nf concentrate and chemical waste streams in the hc htox scenario nf membranes can be used to polish the mf uf permeate whilst retaining essential minerals salts in the final product dai et al 2019 in the hc htox scenario the rejection mechanism of nf membranes is straightforward in view of their small mwco table 1 teixeira and rosa 2005 as such the proposed pathways of ii size exclusion of toxin aq and iii adsorption of toxin aq are expected to dominate fig 3 gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 investigated the efficacy of the trisep membrane mwco 200 da in rejecting mc rr mc lr mc yr mc la and anatoxin a at concentrations of 1 2 9 4 μg l with the results showing that the permeate concentrations were far below the who guideline value of 1 μg l compared to mf uf nf is also more efficient in removing odor compounds choi et al 2010 investigated the removal of seasonal odor compounds 2 mib long term occurrence in january may and august september and geosmin short term occurrence in july september and march april from the han river water by nf membranes results showed that both loose and tight nf membranes exhibited high rejection r of 98 moreover because mf uf are always implemented prior to nf in practical applications in the hc htox scenario the low mw neutral of hpi should be the dominant component in the nf concentrate it has been shown that in a full scale nanofiltration plant wr app will be 75 i e cr 25 resulting in higher concentrations of low mw neutral and toxins in the concentrate gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 however to the best of our knowledge there has been no investigation of the management of the concentrate and chemical waste in nf treated cyanobacteria laden waters up to date 3 4 ro concentrate and chemical waste streams in the lc and hc htox scenarios ro is the state of the art technology for seawater desalination i e swro while recent attention has been given to innovative solar driven and electrical desalination alternatives ma et al 2016 xia et al 2019 in the lc scenario at least for swro plants located in australia and caribbean coastal areas according to the ro plan distribution map developed by villacorte et al 2015 the cr and cf values are largely related to salt rejection in the past forty years the footprint of swro plants has been significantly reduced because of the continual increase in water recovery from cr 75 in 1980s to cr 40 if a second stage is applied now ghaffour et al 2013 this also creates the opportunity for energy recovery from the concentrate while it is open to question whether water recovery in a single stage can be further increased high water recovery at low pressure has been achieved in swro plants utilizing multi stage operation ahunbay 2019 for the concentrate or brine a critical challenge of swro in the lc scenario however relates to the use of antiscalants e g polyacrylic acid and polymaleic acid to prevent the formation of scale on pumps and membranes typically a dose of 0 5 10 ppm is added to the feed solution depending on the scale forming potential of the feed water wr and manufacturer s recommendations singh 2006 which is then concentrated to 1 20 ppm in the brine khan et al 2009 moreover while there has been substantial progress in development of membrane cleaning protocols and reagents e g naoh and more specific products such as suez kleen mct cleaners and ami acid and alkaline membrane cleaners for ro membranes melián martel et al 2013 little attention has been paid to either the analysis of the composition of the chemical cleaning waste or the sustainable management of the waste missimer and maliva 2018 in regard to the use of conventional primary and secondary pre treatments such as coagulation dissolved air flotation and or mf uf membranes busch et al 2010 in swro systems fig 3 algal cells are unlikely to be detected in the feed of the ro unit even in habs i e in the hc htox scenario with toxins such as saxitoxin and domoic acid present at relatively low concentrations ro membranes can reject toxins via pathways of ii size exclusion of toxin aq and iii adsorption of toxin aq shown in fig 3 even though they are designed for salt removal seubert et al 2012 monitored the temporal concentrations from 2005 to 2009 of saxitoxin domoic acid brevetoxin and okadaic acid within the intake and in desalinated water from a pilot ro desalination plant in el segundo ca results showed that while saxitoxin and domoic acid were occasionally found in the intake waters all toxins were not detected in the desalinated water seubert et al 2012 full removal 99 of saxitoxin brevetoxin and domoic acid has been shown to be achieved even at elevated source water concentrations in lab scale studies laycock et al 2012 seubert et al 2012 from published literature li et al 2016 schurer et al 2012 2013 villacorte et al 2015 it is expected that the transport of algal cells aom and toxins to the concentrate and waste streams in the mf uf pretreatment units should be similar to that in drinking water treatment fig 3 though the species present will be significantly different table 2 of particular note is that transparent exopolymer particles teps have been recognised as a fouling indicator in swro but not in drinking water treatment though they are ubiquitous in marine and freshwater environments bar zeev et al 2015 teps can be further specified as particulate tep ptep particle size 0 4 μm and colloidal tep ctep 0 05 μm particle size 0 4 μm in the membrane field villacorte et al 2009 ctep can pass through uf membranes and will accumulate in the ro concentrate ro is capable of retaining if any toxins and ctep present in the feed solution i e uf permeate which however results in their accumulation in the concentrate and chemical waste this can be challenging for decontamination and discharge because the abundant chloride ions in swro concentrate are a well known scavenger for various strong oxidants e g hydroxyl radicals 4 opportunities and perspectives for management of concentrate and waste streams following review of the characteristics of concentrate and waste streams in lc and hc htox scenarios we will identify the opportunities and perspectives for their management in regard to the cost and feasibility of management in existing plants current strategies typically employ coagulation adsorption chemical oxidation or disinfection and energy conversion processes fig 2b which aim at i increasing the overall water recovery ii beneficial use of the concentrate and or iii decontamination of the concentrate and waste streams guidance and perspectives for future studies will be discussed in an eisenhower framework 4 1 opportunities for management of concentrate and waste streams 4 1 1 recycling of mf uf concentrate to increase the water recovery in the lc scenario instead of direct discharge of concentrate and waste streams into sewers one may consider either installing a secondary mf uf unit to recover the waste or blend the waste with the raw water to the main mf uf process gora and walsh 2011 zeman and zydney 2017 although the concentrate and backwashing waste are significantly different in their characteristics section 3 2 and table 4 these two streams are often combined in the lc scenario with the combined stream accounting for approximately 5 10 of the feed volume cr tot 5 10 in view of the high cf values of the concentrate waste with respect to turbidity 20 at c f of 1 3 ntu and total organic carbon 10 at c f of 2 4 mg l but low cf values for doc 1 2 at c f of 2 4 mg l coagulation can be applied fig 2 gora and walsh 2011 reported that a dose of 5 10 mg l of alum aluminium sulphate or aluminium chlorohydrate was sufficient for removing doc by 20 50 and uv254 by 65 80 blending of the combined concentrate cr tot 10 with the raw water can likely improve the removal efficiency of doc uv254 and true color gora and walsh 2011 moreover coagulation may benefit the membrane operation in the subsequent filtration step strong flocs with low distribution spreading index in the feed solution of mf uf are expected to lower the specific cake resistance for these membranes huang et al 2011 4 1 2 beneficial use of ro concentrate in the lc scenario there has been some discussion on possible alternatives to the management of desalination brine i e the concentrate from swro plants such as use for establishment of solar ponds for thermal energy and electricity production and use of the salts through the chlor alkali process khan et al 2009 the hydraulic energy associated with the concentrate due to the high pressure operation of the ro unit is recoverable via either a direct route to pressurise the feed to ro or an indirect route to drive a turbine gude 2011 typically energy recovery devices erds include pelton turbine centrifugal type turbocharger centrifugal type and isobaric erd positive displacement type fig 2b stover 2007 the isobaric erds demonstrate higher energy recovery efficiency 95 97 than the centrifugal types i e pelton turbine 87 and turbocharger 85 though the latter is now more widely used in swro as a result of their mechanical simplicity and operational flexibility gude 2011 another interesting opportunity relates to the use of the chemical potential known as salinity power of the high salinity concentrate logan and elimelech 2012 she et al 2012 for example the energy present as a result of the salinity difference can be recovered as a hydraulic pressure that can be used to spin a turbine in the pressure retarded osmosis pro process she et al 2012 at the same time the brine after pro treatment is diluted to prevent the formation of a density plume during its discharge prante et al 2014 thermodynamic and thermo economic analyses indicated that the integration of pro with swro can reduce the energy consumption of desalination by 40 prante et al 2014 sharqawy et al 2011 alternatively there has been increasing interest in development of electrochemical processes e g reverse electrodialysis mei and tang 2017 mei and tang 2018 to recover the salinity power of the concentrate nevertheless both pro and electrochemical processes are still too expensive for full scale implementation due to their relatively low power density in addition to membrane fouling and stability issues the beneficial use of membrane chemical cleaning waste is generally difficult because of i the relatively small volume generated 3 5 times per year and ii the very complex composition e g citric acid and edta at higher concentrations compared to antiscalants in the concentrate while chemical cleaning waste in swro plants is usually disposed to sanitary sewers khan et al 2009 more work is needed to better characterise the nature of the waste streams and subsequently their potential environmental impacts 4 1 3 decontamination of mf uf concentrate and waste streams in the hc htox scenario in the hc htox scenario recycling of the mf uf concentrate i e a combined stream of the concentrate and the backwashing and forward flushing waste with a typical cr of 10 to the pretreatment units has been considered fig 2b the concentrations of algal cells aoms and total toxins are similar or lower than those in the feed water e g typical values of 106 107 cell ml 5 mg doc l and 1 20 μg l considering the dilution by backwashing waste conventional flocculants including aluminum salts polyacrylamide or chitosan can form larger aggregates that largely remove algal cells and intracellular toxins and toxin aom aq in the concentrate dixon et al 2011 coagulation removes 95 99 of algal cells and intracellular toxins and 20 50 of doc with an alum dose of 5 20 mg l gora and walsh 2011 prior to clarification a powdered activated carbon pac dose of typically 5 25 mg l can be applied to remove free toxins e g 50 60 removal of 22 μg anatoxin a l at a 5 mg l pac dose and 90 removal of 10 μg anatoxin a l at a 11 mg l pac dose vlad et al 2014 the combined use of pac with coagulants can further improve the removal of cyanobacteria and intracellular toxins such as anabaena microcystis and pseudanabaena to 99 99 9 zamyadi et al 2013 which avoids the accumulation of algal cells in the concentrate during internal recycling however this practice results in elevated algal cell numbers and toxin concentrations in the clarifier fig 2b if the chemical sludge is not properly managed breakthrough of cells and toxins in the effluent may occur zamyadi et al 2012 in order to reduce the final discharge of algal cells and toxins into the environment in the hc htox scenario there has been increasing interest to integrate oxidation with membrane based algal separation although most studies focus primarily on membrane fouling control rather than the management of the concentrate liu et al 2017 ma et al 2018 chlorine based oxidants chlorine chloramine and chlorine dioxide are commonly used reagents to oxidize cyanobacteria and toxins while chlorine has reasonable activities for microcystins e g k app of 100 500 m 1s 1 ho et al 2006 and cylindrospermopsin very low rate constants 1 m 1 s 1 have been observed for anatoxin a vlad et al 2014 in comparison ozone permanganate and hydroxyl radicals show higher activities for microcystins anatoxin a and cylindrospermopsin despite the low second order rate constant for cylindrospermopsin oxidation with permanganate 1 m 1 s 1 the efficacy of the oxidants is significantly influenced by the water matrix for example higher aom content in the feed will result in strong scavenging effects in addition the use of ozone and permanganate can induce cell lysis that causes the transformation of intracellular toxins to extracellular or free toxins hall et al 2000 to mitigate this problem the oxidation unit can be placed after the coagulation and clarification unit fig 2b so that the influent algal cell and aom concentrations are minimized the dose of oxidant is usually determined by the organic matter concentration e g 0 1 0 5 mg o3 kmno4 per mg doc at a typical contact time of 30 min rather than by the toxin concentration naceradska et al 2017 vlad et al 2014 because of the competition of aom over low abundant toxins for oxidants e g k ho doc 3 6 108 m 1 s 1 and k ho mc lr 2 3 1010 m 1 s 1 with two orders of magnitude difference in first order rate constants song et al 2009 westerhoff et al 1999 this strategy would nevertheless increase the cost of chemicals considering the much smaller volume of the combined concentrate i e 10 compared to the feed solution the oxidation unit may be alternatively included in the recycling loop fig 2b pre oxidation prior to coagulation may offer some benefits for example naceradska et al 2017 found that permanganate is capable of preventing the formation of fe peptide protein complexes that inhibit coagulation with the adsorption of organic matter onto the hydrous mno2 generated improving the efficiency of the following coagulation step essentially the challenge relating to the reuse of the concentrate in the hc htox scenario compared to that in the lc scenario is contributed by the algal concentration in the raw water with source reduction of the intake gaining in popularity fig 2b for instance a patented flowing g c3n4 photocatalyst capable of inactivating m aeruginosa under solar irradiation in contained cyanobacteria laden water has been developed by song et al 2018b results showed that up to 90 removal and degradation of m aeruginosa at an initial concentration of 2 7 106 cells ml can be achieved under 6 h of irradiation at a catalyst dose of 2 g l cell lysis occurs mainly as a result of the attack of ho and h generated on the semiconductor surface the intracellular and extracellular mc lr is further degraded by the oxidation of the adda chain song et al 2018a 2018b 4 1 4 critical pretreatment for ro in the hc htox scenario for swro plants in the hc htox scenario the potentially beneficial use of the concentrate largely relies on the mf uf pretreatment unit i e reduction from the feed because i the high rejection of ro membranes will result in the accumulation of toxins in the concentrate and ii decontamination of the concentrate at large volume is not cost effective in view of the scavenging effect of the complicated matrix while the efficacy of ozonation is less affected by chloride ions more toxic byproducts can be formed in the presence of bromide vlad et al 2014 at the same time best practice with respect to solid reuse of the concentrate is under open discussion fig 2b more studies are required to understand the relationship between the presence of toxins and at what level in the concentrate and contamination of the salts in the chlor alkali industry 4 2 perspectives for management of concentrate and waste streams fig 5 summarises the relative state of knowledge and importance of topics discussed in this review paper overall there have been numerous studies on the removal of algae aom and toxins and odor compounds by membrane separation adsorption and oxidation in pure water or simple matrices such that these topics deserve low priority in future research lower right quadrant of fig 5 in comparison more studies are needed on the impacts of membrane permeability and selectivity on the transport of aom and toxins in membrane based algal separation especially at pilot scale with realistic water matrices see issues of ongoing concern upper right quadrant of fig 5 for example the incorporation of hydrophilic metal organic frameworks into the membrane matrix has been investigated to create selective nanochannels for enhancing the rejection of micropollutants dai et al 2019 results of the relevant studies have facilitated the construction of nanochannels with specific characteristics e g charge density and terminal functional groups capable of improving the water flux decreasing cr whilst achieving selective removal of low abundant compounds e g toxins and odor compounds currently there is limited investigation on the formation and control of byproducts when the backwashing water contains disinfectants as such this issue requires ongoing attention in future studies upper right quadrant of fig 5 as previously mentioned in section 4 1 there is a lack of studies on the disposal of chemical waste generated from membrane cleaning in the hc htox scenario the widespread practice of discharge to the sewers can cause critical problems due to the presence of toxins in the chemical waste fig 2 also the reaction of algal cells aom and toxins with chlorine likely results in the formation of highly toxic byproducts huang et al 2009b which has been rarely considered in past studies as such priority should be given to the better understanding and monitoring e g through on line electrochemical sensors zhang et al 2019 of the secondary pollution that may be generated during the disposal of the waste streams in the hc htox scenario similar importance is assigned to the management of the chemical sludge from the pretreatment step such as coagulation of the feed solution and recycling of the concentrate upper left quadrant of fig 5 while adsorption followed by oxidation is very efficient in regenerating the concentrate critical challenges remain in regard to the low selectivity of the target pollutants e g toxins that are present at much lower concentrations than the bulk natural organic matter e g at μg l level compared to doc at mg l level these needs call for novel methods for management of the membrane concentrate in drinking water treatment upper left quadrant of fig 5 in this regard design of heterogeneous aops with the catalysts electrodes capable of selective uptake of target pollutants to the interface followed by oxidation chen et al 2020 offers more opportunity for the future however research in this field is still in its infancy in addition areas requiring additional research include the need for development of composite membranes and new desalination technologies for minimal generation of concentrate e g spatially isolating salt crystallisation from water evaporation as described by xia et al 2019 lower left quadrant of fig 5 magnéli phase titanium suboxide ti4o7 has the ability to be used in the preparation of reactive electrochemical membranes that enables fine filtration whilst oxidising the pollutants deposited on the membrane surface chaplin 2014 this strategy is conducive to decreasing the br of the backwashing waste long term evaluation and economic and life cycle analyses of these alternatives will be invaluable in identifying viable low cost processes for better management of the concentrate and waste streams for membrane based algal separation in water treatment and desalination 5 conclusions in this paper recent research advances in relation to the management of concentrate and waste streams from membrane based algal separation processes have been reviewed from the viewpoint of the characteristics of

membrane based desalination processes to alleviate the water shortage due to its low energy consumption and high efficiency fritzmann et al 2007 however membrane fouling poses an obstacle to the application of ro desalination processes membrane fouling can be divided into four types particulate fouling organic fouling inorganic fouling and biofouling andrews et al 2008 fritzmann et al 2007 goh et al 2018 guo et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 malaeb and ayoub 2011 matin et al 2019 inorganic fouling which generally refers to mineral scaling is a challenging problem due to the high amount of total dissolved solids of feed water and the nearly complete salt rejection andrews et al 2008 when salt concentration increases and exceeds the solubility of sparingly soluble salts scale formation from bulk and surface crystallization easily occurs causing membrane blocking and the deterioration of membrane performance common mineral scaling includes metal ion based scales which are mostly alkaline earth metal based scales and silica based scales matin et al 2019 oh et al 2009 tong et al 2019 to mitigate the risk of membrane scaling many methods including feed water pretreatment the optimization of operational processes the development of novel membrane materials and the addition of antiscalants have been developed in accordance with the characteristics of ro operating systems fig 1 and different feed water anis et al 2019 antony et al 2011 badruzzaman et al 2019 goh et al 2018 greenlee et al 2009a henthorne and boysen 2015 jamaly et al 2014 kang and cao 2012 tong et al 2019 table 1 summarizes the details of these methods for mitigating membrane scaling including their advantages and disadvantages as indicated in table 1 pretreatment processes which typically consist of softening ph adjustment and the use of larger pore size membrane are necessary to reduce scale formation anis et al 2019 badruzzaman et al 2019 darton 2000 greenlee et al 2009a henthorne and boysen 2015 jamaly et al 2014 kelle zeiher et al 2003 tong et al 2019 lime softening and ion exchange softening can remove scale forming substances such as ca2 and mg2 and decrease scaling potential in the subsequent membrane procedure anis et al 2019 jamaly et al 2014 tong et al 2019 adjusting the ph of feed water is effective for mitigating the formation of certain types of sparingly soluble salts because the solubility of carbonate minerals and silica scale is significantly related to ph bush et al 2018 milne et al 2014 tong et al 2019 pretreatment using larger pore size membrane before the ro unit including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration and nanofiltration nf is also an effective method for alleviating scale formation by separation of contaminants such as colloids some organic matters oms multivalent ions and part of monovalent ions anis et al 2019 badruzzaman et al 2019 jamaly et al 2014 tong et al 2019 these pretreatment methods play important roles in the stable operation of a ro unit but subsequent problems caused by these methods such as the wastes produced by lime softening increased costs due to additional equipment and aggravated corrosion under low ph cannot be disregarded al rammah 2000 anis et al 2019 gill 1999 hasson et al 1998 shahid et al 2018 the overall design of a ro system exerts critical effects on its stable operation many aspects including feed water characteristics e g ph temperature composition the selection and optimization of operational parameters e g applied pressure hydrodynamic conditions target recovery and membrane cleaning should be considered goh et al 2018 greenlee et al 2009a henthorne and boysen 2015 liu et al 2019 matin et al 2019 qasim et al 2019 tong et al 2019 the design and preparation of novel antifouling membranes have been popular issues because membrane fouling is closely related to membrane surface properties goh et al 2018 tong et al 2019 zhang et al 2016b tong et al 2019 summarized existing pieces of evidence that prove the importance of membrane surface properties in regulating mineral scale formation during membrane desalination and discussed the challenges experienced in the design and fabrication of novel scaling resistant membranes besides the addition of antiscalants is one of the most commonly applied methods for inhibiting scaling in the ro process especially in the situation that a high water recovery is set to reduce concentrate volume but cause an enhanced scaling potential due to its high efficiency low cost and easy operation darton 2000 rahardianto et al 2007 tong et al 2019 antiscalants comprise a class of water treatment agents that can inhibit scale formation through one or more effective mechanisms such as chelation dispersion crystal distortion and threshold darton 2000 li et al 2011 many reports have confirmed that the use of antiscalants in ro processes can effectively mitigate scale formation and assure the long term stable operation of ro systems al shammiri et al 2000 darton 2000 fritzmann et al 2007 greenlee et al 2009a tong et al 2019 thus a comprehensive understanding of the effects and mechanisms of antiscalants in ro systems will be extremely helpful in improving antiscalants performance and availability in fact research on the applications and mechanisms of antiscalants to ro systems remains unsystematic although the addition of antiscalants to ro systems has been confirmed and classified as one of the popular pretreatment methods in many studies anis et al 2019 greenlee et al 2009a henthorne and boysen 2015 jamaly et al 2014 qasim et al 2019 tong et al 2019 however most previous reviews focused on the development of novel antiscalants and their traditional applications to the boiler water and cooling water industries chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 thus this work presented exhaustive knowledge about the applications and mechanisms of antiscalants to ro systems the effects of various internal and external factors on the scale formation and the antiscalants performance were summarized finally the problems caused by existing antiscalants and the limitations and prospects of antiscalants in practical ro applications were discussed in detail scheme 1 describes the overview of various antiscalants and their applications in ro membrane scaling control 2 scale inhibition mechanisms 2 1 scale formation and growth kinetics 2 1 1 scale formation mineral scaling can be approximately categorized into metal ion and silica based scales based on the characteristics of their chemical components matin et al 2019 tong et al 2019 metal ion based scale including calcium carbonate magnesium carbonate calcium sulfate and barium sulfate is generally formed via crystallization the formation of scales i e the growth of crystal occurs as described in fig 2 1 when the salt concentration is over the solubility of sparingly soluble salts the ions start colliding to form ion pairs and cluster as micronuclei 2 some of the micronuclei become nucleation centers and then ion clusters begin aligning in an orderly manner to form stable nuclei 3 crystals grow gradually from nuclei and this process is irreversible al roomi and hussain 2016 darton 2000 matin et al 2019 silica based scale can be classified into silica scaling and metal silicates ning 2002 topçu et al 2017 the formation of silica based scale is a complex process resulting from silica polymerization and the accumulation of amorphous colloidal silica which depends on various conditions including ph temperature ionic strength the presence of multivalent ions and the silica concentration bush et al 2018 milne et al 2014 silica polymerization is considered to occur via dehydration and formation of si o si anhydride bonds n si oh 4 oh 3si o si oh 3 dimer oligomers colloidal polymers infinite extensions sio2 n as shown in fig 3 ketsetzi et al 2008 milne et al 2014 ning 2002 weng 1995 zhang et al 2012 the existence of multivalent cations in a silica containing solution is one of main causes to decrease the solubility of silica and easily form metal silicates due to the interactions between multivalent cations and silicate anions resulting in scale formation even at concentrations below silica saturation milne et al 2014 ning 2002 weng 1995 in ro systems the widely accepted membrane scaling can be classified into bulk homogeneous crystallization and surface heterogeneous crystallization as shown in fig 4 goh et al 2018 matin et al 2019 oh et al 2009 qasim et al 2019 shirazi et al 2010 on the one hand solutions are concentrated several times in accordance with water recovery when salt concentration increases and exceeds the solubility of sparingly soluble salts scales are formed in the solutions namely the products of bulk crystallization and deposited onto membrane surface causing membrane blocking on the other hand scales can directly form and grow on membrane surface under enhanced concentration polarization and salt supersaturation matin et al 2019 the prevailing scale formation in ro process is influenced by several factors such as supersaturation level feed water characteristics and hydrodynamics generally bulk crystallization is more obvious at high supersaturation level and low crossflow velocity matin et al 2019 surface crystallization is closely related not only to supersaturation level but also to concentration polarization on the membrane surface goh et al 2018 matin et al 2019 semiat et al 2001 shirazi et al 2010 silica scaling in ro systems is similar to the metal ion based scale formation in the two crystallization processes mentioned earlier including deposits of amorphous colloidal silica and direct scaling on membrane surface 2 1 2 scale growth kinetics scale crystal growth kinetics which is based on the online observation and monitoring of the entire crystallization processes is an extremely useful method for investigating the detailed scaling process agarwal and berglund 2004 the measurements of changes in bulk fluid properties such as turbidity conductivity ion concentration and ph are typically applied to obtain the information of induction time t ind and crystal growth rate r abdel aal et al 2015 fischer et al 2011 lee et al 2015 olderøy et al 2009 rabizadeh et al 2017 on the basis of classic nucleation theory boerlage et al 2002 dydo et al 2004 hasson et al 2003 manoli and dalas 2001 mullin 2001 the nucleation rate j can be expressed by 1 j a exp β γ 3 v m 2 f θ k 3 t 3 ln s 2 where a is a frequency factor β is a geometric shape factor of 16π 3 for the spherical nucleus and f θ is a correction factor which is equal to 1 0 for homogeneous nucleation and to 1 0 for heterogeneous nucleation hasson et al 2003 several researchers abdel aal et al 2015 el shall et al 2005 have used f θ 0 01 to estimate the heterogeneous nucleation rate v m is the molar volume of the phase forming and γ is the surface energy j m2 s is the supersaturation ratio k is the boltzmann constant and t is the absolute temperature the induction time t ind is inversely proportional to j hasson et al 2001 2003 liu et al 2019 and the relation between t ind and s can be written as 2 ln t i n d b β γ 3 v m 2 f θ k 3 t 3 ln s 2 where b is a constant thus surface energy can be determined experimentally by measuring the slope of the straight line that correlates lnt ind with 1 lns 2 for surface crystallization surface crystallization can be greatly enhanced by concentration polarization on the membrane surface in addition to supersaturation level goh et al 2018 matin et al 2019 semiat et al 2001 shirazi et al 2010 concentration polarization refers to the phenomenon in which a boundary layer exists near the membrane surface within which solute concentration is higher than bulk solute concentration due to the convective flow from the bulk feed toward the membrane surface qasim et al 2019 the concentration polarization level cp can be expressed by hasson et al 2001 2003 matin et al 2019 sutzkover et al 2000 3 c p c m c b e j v k m where c m and c b are the salt concentrations at the membrane surface and bulk solution respectively j v is the permeate flux and k m is the mass transfer coefficient the evaluation of cp requires estimating the mass transfer coefficient k m sutzkover et al 2000 reported a simple technique to determine k m and cp in a ro system k m is given by 4 k m j v s a l t ln δ p π b π p 1 j v s a l t j v h 2 o where π b and π p are the osmotic pressure of the saline feed and the permeate respectively j v h2o and j v salt are the permeate flux of the salt free water and the saline solution respectively and δp is the transmembrane pressure c m can be estimated using eq 3 then the supersaturation ratio in the membrane system s w that prevails on the membrane surface for a type of sparingly soluble salt axby can be calculated using the following equation 5 s w c a m y c b m x k s p c p c a b y c p c b b x k s p c p x y c a b y c b b x k s p where c a m and c b m refer to membrane surface concentration c a b and c b b refer to bulk concentration and k sp is the solubility product in summary the supersaturation level for a certain salt on a membrane surface can be obtained in accordance with cp based on eqs 3 5 high cp can lead to a high solute concentration in the boundary layer causing increased osmotic pressure and supersaturation level which enhance membrane surface crystallization and increase the risk of scaling and reducing permeate flux matin et al 2019 qasim et al 2019 in general increased applied pressure and water recovery can lead to severe concentration polarization a high crossflow velocity can move formed particles away from the membrane surface and reduce concentration polarization goh et al 2018 matin et al 2019 qasim et al 2019 shirazi et al 2010 the surface energy for a process of surface nucleation on membrane surface can be also estimated using t ind and the obtained s w based on eq 2 when eqs 2 and 5 are combined the following equation that reflects membrane surface crystallization based on cp can be obtained as 6 ln t i n d b β γ 3 v m 2 f θ k 3 t 3 ln c p x y c a b y c b b x k s p 2 from eqs 2 and 6 determining the onset of membrane scaling and t ind is crucial for investigating the membrane scaling process hasson et al 2001 2003 extracted t ind data from plots of permeate flux versus time which were successfully correlated with the supersaturation level based on nucleation theory the membrane scaling can be assessed by t ind and obtained crystallization surface energy however difficulties and uncertainties remain in determining t ind on the membrane surface heterogeneous nucleation on membrane surface is clearly favored which causes surface crystallization even at low supersaturation levels hence incipient membrane scaling may not cause an evident change in the measured bulk fluid properties or permeate flux karabelas et al 2020 van de lisdonk et al 2001 presented a supersaturation prediction model aiming at monitoring the early stage of scaling which can calculate the supersaturation ratio of sparingly soluble salts on membrane surface the scaling monitor was proved to be able to detect scaling before it occurred in the last stage of the pilot plant besides real time membrane observation is a sensitive method for identifying incipient scaling but with limitations in spatial resolution karabelas et al 2020 reliable techniques for monitoring incipient scaling are important for the quantitative assessment of antiscalant inhibitory effectiveness in ro systems and further effort is required to develop useful monitoring methods 2 2 normal inhibition mechanisms 2 2 1 metal ion based scale different mineral scales have various features and follow different inhibition mechanisms in general antiscalants can typically influence bulk crystallization of metal ion base scale by interfering with one or more of the crystallization stages because these chemical agents with various functional groups such as phosphonic carboxylic and sulfonic groups can interact with scale forming substances and inhibit scale formation through one or more of the widely accepted inhibition mechanisms which include chelation dispersion lattice distortion and threshold effects as summarized in table 2 al roomi and hussain 2016 amjad 2014 darton 2000 dobberschütz et al 2018 li et al 2011 rahman 2013 chelation refers to the complexation of antiscalants with scale forming cations via a stoichiometric reaction which can increase the solubility of sparingly soluble salts al roomi and hussain 2016 darton 2000 dispersion effect is that antiscalants are adsorbed onto crystals generally providing them with surface charge and causing mineral crystals to repel one another through steric interactions keeping them dispersed in the solution al roomi and hussain 2016 darton 2000 li et al 2011 for enveloping crystals and providing them with surface charge antiscalants with a relatively high molecular weight mw 20 000 da are suitable as effective dispersants darton 2000 antiscalants can disrupt the crystallization process by interacting with mineral nuclei inhibiting and or distorting crystal growth al roomi and hussain 2016 darton 2000 li et al 2011 liu et al 2019 the formed crystal morphologies can be changed due to the adsorption of antiscalants called lattice distortion influencing the clustering process and preventing the precipitation of sparingly soluble salts via sub stoichiometric amounts of antiscalants is considered threshold effect darton 2000 ketrane et al 2009 the inhibition and distortion of scale formation in the crystal growth process are caused by the adsorption of antiscalants onto the active sites of crystal surfaces exploring the adsorption behavior of antiscalants on crystal surfaces can provide in depth understanding of scale inhibition mechanisms the coverage θ of antiscalants on the crystal surface can changed the crystal growth rate in the absence of antiscalants r 0 to r i as shown in the following equation akin et al 2008 kırboğa and öner 2009 nielsen et al 2012 7 r i r 0 1 θ the adsorption behavior can be investigated by fitting the experimental data that correspond to different antiscalant concentrations with a suitable adsorption isothermal model accordingly the adsorption constant can be obtained and compared akin et al 2008 kırboğa and öner 2009 lin and singer 2005 nielsen et al 2012 langmuir type model has been widely used to interpret the decrease in growth rates of some sparingly soluble salts in the presence of antiscalants and the coverage θ for this adsorption model is described by the following equation akin et al 2008 kırboğa and öner 2009 nielsen et al 2012 8 θ k c i 1 k c i where k is the affinity constant which is the ratio of the rate constants for adsorption and desorption k ads k des and c i is the total equilibrium concentration of an antiscalant from eqs 7 and 8 the relationship between r i and c i can be given as 9 r 0 r 0 r i 1 1 k c i the affinity constant k can be obtained from the slope of the linear relationship between r 0 r 0 r i and 1 c i as a measure of the adsorption affinity of antiscalants on the crystal surface akin et al 2008 studied the effect of carboxymethyl inulin cmi on the crystal growth of calcium oxalate the results indicated that t ind increased and r i decreased with increasing carboxyl content on the polymer backbone the adsorption of polymeric antiscalants on the crystal can be fitted in a langmuir type isothermal model the obtained affinity constant was high for the cmi with a high carboxylation degree which may reflect its strong adsorption onto the crystal surface akin et al 2008 molecular dynamics simulations have also been conducted to investigate the interaction between the crystal surface and additives chen et al 2013 ji et al 2017 shen et al 2018 shi et al 2012 2013 2017 zhang et al 2016a the binding energy e b of antiscalants on the crystal surface can be computed using the following equation 10 e b e a d s e s y s t e m e s u r f a c e e a n t i s c a l a n t where e system is the total energy of the antiscalant surface system e surface is the energy of the crystal surface and e antiscalant is the energy of the free antiscalant molecule the larger the binding energy the more favorable the interactions between the crystal surface and the antiscalant shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2016a this method can provide a theoretical basis for the interaction between antiscalant and crystal surface at the molecular level in addition to bulk crystallization the addition of antiscalants may inhibit surface crystallization by changing the surface energy of heterogeneous nucleation and decreasing the nucleation rate which can be reflected by eq 6 hasson et al 2001 2003 however antiscalants can also influence surface crystallization via adsorption onto membrane surface and alteration of membrane surface properties sometimes causing aggravated membrane scaling which would be discussed in detail later ang et al 2016 benecke et al 2018 2 2 2 silica based scale given the considerable difference between silica scaling and metal silicates the required antiscalants and the corresponding inhibition mechanisms are quite different for metal silicates similar to the aforementioned popular metal ion based scale the interactions of antiscalants with multivalent cations should be the primary inhibition mechanisms the antiscalants that contain anionic groups may increase the solubility of metal silicates by interacting with multivalent cations topçu et al 2017 thus preventing the formation of metal silicates for silica scaling the inhibition mechanisms mostly include interfering with the silica polymerization process and dispersing colloidal silica particles weng 1995 zhang et al 2011 the surface charges of various silica species are negative within a wide ph region due to the deprotonation of surface silanol groups schindler et al 1976 sjöberg 1996 weng 1995 zhang et al 2011 conventional antiscalants that contain anionic groups thus exhibit nearly no inhibition efficiency against silica scale goh et al 2018 neofotistou and demadis 2004b zhang et al 2011 it is expected that positively charged antiscalants can interact with negatively charged silica via electrostatic attraction thereby not only interfering with the polymerization of silica monomers or soluble silica oligomers but also dispersing colloidal silica particles and preventing their agglomeration as shown in fig 5 topçu et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 3 antiscalants 3 1 phosphorus antiscalants antiscalants can be approximately classified into phosphorus and phosphorus free antiscalants al roomi and hussain 2016 hasson et al 2011 he et al 2009 ketrane et al 2009 li et al 2011 phosphorus antiscalants include phosphates and phosphonates nowack 2003 rashchi and finch 2000 the two structures are different phosphates are defined as compounds that contain p o linkage with the orthophosphate ion po4 3 as the basic building unit rashchi and finch 2000 such as sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate shmp as shown in fig 6 phosphonates are compounds containing one or more c po oh 2 groups which are more stable than phosphates due to the existence of stable covalent c p bond nowack 2003 the structures of some typical phosphonates are presented in fig 7 phosphates and phosphonates can be both used as complexing agents in many applications due to their excellent complexing ability although phosphate was found to prevent scale formation or dissolve precipitates by forming relatively stable soluble complexes with metal ions as early as the end of the 19th century rashchi and finch 2000 phosphates easily hydrolyze into orthophosphate ions which may form precipitates with calcium ions and increase the potential of biofouling al roomi and hussain 2015 andrews et al 2008 darton 2000 ghani and al deffeeri 2010 li et al 2017 phosphonates thus have a wider range of applications because of their structural stability in short as the most popular inhibitors phosphorus inhibitors including phosphates and phosphonates account for a large share in the antiscalants market considering their good cost effective performance gryta 2012 lin and singer 2005 with increasing focus on environmental issues phosphorus emissions that will lead to heavy eutrophication and increased biofouling have been receiving considerable attention and thus their utilization is gradually restricted al roomi and hussain 2015 3 2 synthetic polymeric antiscalants the development of low phosphorus or phosphorus free scale inhibitors has become a major issue to reduce phosphorus emissions from the use of antiscalants phosphorus antiscalants have been partly replaced with synthetic polymeric scale inhibitors without phosphorus for common metal ion based scale the carboxylic group on the polymeric backbone is an effective functional group for inhibiting scale formation yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c the class of polycarboxylic acid inhibitors synthesized through the polymerization of monomers that contain carboxylic groups can interact with scale forming substances via carboxylic groups and efficiently prevent scale formation al hamzah et al 2014 kavitha et al 2011 senthilmurugan et al 2010 tang et al 2008 in addition to carboxylic groups inhibitors that contain multiple types of functional groups exhibit better inhibition performance due to synergistic effects compared with those with a single functional group such as hydroxyl sulfonic amino and ether groups chen et al 2015a dietzsch et al 2013 shakkthivel and vasudevan 2006 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c the introduction of multiple types of functional groups into polymeric antiscalants via the copolymerization of various monomers increases water solubility and improves the dispersion effect of polymers enhancing the inhibition performance of antiscalants dietzsch et al 2013 gao et al 2015 li et al 2017 shakkthivel and vasudevan 2006 yang et al 2017 some typical anionic monomers used in the synthesis of antiscalants are presented in fig 8 these synthetic polymeric antiscalants can effectively chelate with metal ions and disperse microcrystal particles in solutions due to the existence of hydrophilic anionic groups and thus show excellent scale inhibition efficiency shakkthivel and vasudevan 2006 yang et al 2017 apart from anionic polymeric antiscalants against metal ion based scale some cationic polymers have been used in inhibiting silica scale formation chen et al 2017 demadis and neofotistou 2007 demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 neofotistou and demadis 2004a neofotistou and demadis 2004b zhang et al 2011 anionic antiscalants have no effect on silica scale formation due to the special properties of silica scale that differ from those of metal ion based scale neofotistou and demadis 2004b by contrast some cationic polymers are effective at preventing silica scale formation ketsetzi et al 2008 neofotistou and demadis 2004a neofotistou and demadis 2004b several studies have reported the inhibition effects of some cationic polymers such as polyaminoamide pamam dendrimers with nh2 termini neofotistou and demadis 2004a neofotistou and demadis 2004b adipic acid amine terminated polyether d230 diethylenetriamine copolymer zhang et al 2011 synthesized cationic inulin catin ketsetzi et al 2008 polyethyleneimine pei polyallylamine hydrochloride palam and poly acrylamide co diallyldimethylammonium chloride pamalam demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 on silica scale these studies have shown that inhibition performance is related to polymeric structure and cationic charge density demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 ketsetzi et al 2008 positively charged polymers can associate with negatively charged silica monomers or soluble silica oligomers and thus interfere with the silica polymerization process and prevent the formation of colloid silica particles zhang et al 2011 different cationic polymeric antiscalants such as pamam pei palam and pamalam with various cationic groups i e weak cationic groups primary and secondary amines nh3 and rnh2 and strong cationic groups quaternary ammonium nr3 typically exhibit different inhibition performance demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 ketsetzi et al 2008 neofotistou and demadis 2004b although all of them can interact with negatively charged silica through electrostatic effects strong cationic polymers that contained quaternary ammonium salt groups palam and pamamlam demonstrated relatively poor performance against silica compared with pei which contains amine groups accordingly strong cationic groups may lead to decreased inhibition performance which may be due to the distinct interactions with silica from different cationic groups causing various effects demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 besides cationic polymers with strong cationic groups are typically ready to aggregate silica colloids through their evident coagulation effects apart from their antiscaling effect dao et al 2016 yang et al 2016 however the specific relationship between silica and antiscalants with different molecular structures is not yet well understood thus further research on the interactions between antiscalants and silica based scaling is required to gain an in depth understanding of the inhibition mechanisms for silica based scale and to develop effective antiscalants against silica based scaling in addition to ionic antiscalants water soluble nonionic polymers such as polyacrylamide lee et al 2015 wang et al 2006 yu et al 2006 and poly vinyl alcohol lakshminarayanan et al 2003 also have evident effects on caco3 crystallization crystal morphologies can be influenced by the interference of polymers that results from the crystal distortion effect lakshminarayanan et al 2003 lee et al 2015 wang et al 2006 yu et al 2006 apart from the electric nature of functional groups the content of functional groups on polymeric antiscalants plays an important role in their scale inhibition performance chen et al 2015a a high content of ionic groups typically results in high inhibition performance wang et al 2017b yu et al 2019 however a suitable content of ionic groups is sometimes required and a high charge density is occasionally detrimental to inhibition behavior because it may enhance other effects such as the flocculation effect wang et al 2017b yu et al 2018 chen et al 2015a used serine and polysuccinimide to prepare modified poly aspartic acid ser pasp and found ser pasp obtained at a molar ratio of 0 8 exhibited better inhibition performance against caco3 than those of ser pasp at high or low molar ratio and poly aspartic acid pasp which may be attributed to the synergistic effect induced at suitable contents and ratio of the introduced hydroxyl and carboxylic groups moreover polymer based materials exhibit the structural characteristics of multiplicity which considerably differs from those of small molecular materials elias 1984 flory 1953 apart from different contents and types of chemical compositions on the local chains mentioned earlier the structural morphology molecular size and conformation of polymers due to their distinct long chain structural features are particularly important determinants of final performance including the inhibition performance of polymeric antiscalants for example mw which is the most basic and important structural parameter of polymers and indicates macromolecular size exerts considerable influence on scale inhibition performance darton 2000 matin et al 2019 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2017b a relatively low mw is generally favorable for suppressing crystallization and a relatively high mw is required to act as dispersants darton 2000 matin et al 2019 polyacrylic acid paa which is the most common synthetic polymeric antiscalant with different mws has been found to exhibit varying inhibition behavior such as acting as a threshold agent within an mw range of 1000 3000 da exhibiting lattice distortion effect at an mw of 5000 10 000 da and working as a dispersion agent at an mw of 20 000 40 000 da darton 2000 however polymeric antiscalants with excessively high mw or under overdose typically result in poor inhibition performance which may be attributed to their bridging flocculation effects ali et al 2015 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2017b yu et al 2018 for polymeric antiscalants with multiple types of functional groups particularly for copolymers their distributions on the polymeric backbone i e the sequence structure are evidently influential in scale inhibition in addition to the contents and types of functional groups wang et al 2016b yu et al 2018 thus the molecular structure of polymeric antiscalants should be focused on and considered a key factor for improving the design of novel effective antiscalants in contrast with the hydrolysis of phosphorus based inhibitors these synthetic polymers are more resistant to high operating temperatures hasson et al 2011 this also means that they are nonbiodegradable which may have a profound environmental influence after their disposal hasson et al 2011 matin et al 2019 3 3 environment friendly antiscalants considering environmental impact the development of scale inhibitors has moved toward environment friendly antiscalants that are phosphorus free biodegradable and cost effective chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 at present the most promising alternatives to conventional phosphorus or nonbiodegradable synthetic polymeric inhibitors are pasp polyepoxysuccinic acid pesa and their derivatives chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 their structures are presented in fig 9 pasp and pesa have good chelating ability and dispersibility making them as general purpose antiscalants which have been applied in various fields such as industrial circulating water boiler water oil field water and ro desalination systems chaussemier et al 2015 chen et al 2015a hasson et al 2011 liu et al 2012a xu et al 2012 zhang et al 2016c to improve the comprehensive inhibition performance and application range of pasp and pesa considerable research has focused on introducing new functional groups onto them through various chemical modification processes chaussemier et al 2015 chen et al 2015a gao et al 2015 pramanik et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c 2017 apart from pasp and pesa some natural polymers that contain abundant functional groups with good chelating and dispersion effects such as starch cellulose lignin inulin tannin and collagen are also considered sources of potential environment friendly antiscalants due to their advantages of abundant source low cost and biodegradability boels and witkamp 2011 chauhan et al 2012 chaussemier et al 2015 guo et al 2013 hasson et al 2011 qiang et al 2013 wang et al 2017b yu et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2016a the applications of these natural polymers and their derivatives to scale inhibition have been reported and studies have indicated that suitable chemical modifications can considerably improve their inhibition performance boels and witkamp 2011 chauhan et al 2012 goncharuk et al 2012 guo et al 2013 hasson et al 2011 qiang et al 2013 wang et al 2017b yu et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2013 fig 10 presents the structures of several modified natural polymers that can be used as inhibitors some oms secreted by bacteria are also considered potential environment friendly bio antiscalants because they contain large amounts of effective functional groups li et al 2019 soluble extracellular polymeric substances s eps mostly including proteins polysaccharides and humic like substances extracted from bacillus cereus b cereus were evaluated as dual bio functional corrosion and scale inhibiting agents li et al 2019 they demonstrated good anti scale and anti corrosion performance through their chelating adsorption and biomineralization abilities with the advantages of biodegradability strong biosorption affinity and multiple fixation sites b cereus s eps may offer a green sustainable and economic strategy for developing environment friendly antiscalants however these biomaterials are also considered biofouling reducing membrane flux because of their easy adsorption onto membrane surface matin et al 2011 thus bio antiscalants can be effectively utilized in non membrane systems such as circulating cooling water but should be carefully controlled in membrane systems similar to synthetic polymeric antiscalants the molecular structures of environment friendly antiscalants not only the contents and types of functional groups but also the distributions of these functional groups long chain morphologies and mw which are associated with their specific interactions with various scale forming substances should be focused on and studied in depth to understand their inhibition mechanisms and to design and fabricate novel high performance and environment friendly antiscalants 4 evaluation of inhibition performance 4 1 operation methods proper and accurate evaluation of inhibition performance can provide useful guidance such as the selection of antiscalants and their approximate doses for the effective utilization of antiscalants in practical applications the detailed operation methods for the evaluation of scale inhibition performance can be divided into two major categories static and dynamic methods static methods include static jar test gb t 16632 2008 yang et al 2017 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 bubble method hg t 2024 2009 turbidity method abdel aal et al 2015 rabizadeh et al 2017 conductivity method goh et al 2018 and constant composition precipitation method lakshtanov et al 2011 the most common static method is the static jar test due to easy operation the apparent inhibition efficiency can be estimated directly by the change of solute concentration besides the changes in scale crystal morphology and the degrees of crystal distortion determined by electron microscopy and x ray diffraction can verify the effects of antiscalants also kim et al 2005 lee et al 2015 liu et al 2012b however its limitation is that different situations and conditions exist between the static jar test and practical applications making the obtained results not fully applicable to and inconsistent with many practical conditions boerlage et al 2002 hasson et al 1996 2001 considerable difference from practical application conditions also exists in other static methods the evaluation results from these methods may be unsuitable for practical applications but they can be used as pre evaluation approaches hasson et al 2001 dynamic methods can provide credible results for the practical applicability of antiscalants by simulating the conditions for practical applications al roomi and hussain 2015 2016 al roomi et al 2015 with regard to evaluating scale inhibition performance in dynamic ro systems a laboratory scale ro unit is typically used to simulate an actual ro process the scale inhibition performance can be determined by comparing the changes in permeate flux with and without antiscalant addition besides direct visual membrane surface monitoring by using an electron microscopy is also a useful method to evaluate scale surface coverage and surface number density that can reflect the effectiveness of antiscalants in ro processes bartman et al 2011 hasson et al 2001 lyster et al 2010 rahardianto et al 2008 shih et al 2005 shmulevsky et al 2017 thompson et al 2017 uchymiak et al 2008 compared with those of static methods the operational conditions of ro simulation tests can be closer to those of actual ro systems by adjusting operational parameters including pressure crossflow velocity and feed spacer the evaluation results from dynamic ro simulation tests are certainly more instructive 4 2 influencing factors many environmental factors can affect the properties of feed water and antiscalants scale formation and ro operation and thus influence the final inhibition efficiency al amoudi 2010 antony et al 2011 karabelas et al 2020 milne et al 2014 the effects of several popular external factors such as dose ph temperature and different coexisting substances on the scale formation and inhibition performance of antiscalants are discussed as follows 4 2 1 dose dose exerts considerable effect on inhibition performance on the one hand an inadequate dose of antiscalants may be insufficient to interact with scale forming substances and cause weak inhibition efficiency le gouellec and elimelech 2002b on the other hand an overdose of antiscalants may cause detrimental effects favoring scale formation by enhancing other effects such as bridging flocculation effect or the intermolecular interaction of antiscalants in addition to the antiscaling effect wang et al 2016b wang et al 2017b yang et al 2010b yang et al 2010c wang et al 2016b investigated the influence of the concentration of alkyl ethoxy carboxylates c12h25o ch2ch2o nch2coona on the inhibition efficiency against caco3 scale the results indicated that inhibition efficiency decreased slightly with the further increase of dose after maximum efficiency was reached which may be due to the reduced adsorption of antiscalants on caco3 crystals caused by the enhanced interaction of hydrophobic chain chain with an increase in ethylene oxide content in water when overdosing wang et al 2016b a similar phenomenon was observed in a polymeric antiscalant namely carboxymethyl starch cms against caco3 which was ascribed to the flocculation effect of the polymeric inhibitor and enhanced intermolecular hydrogen bonding at excessive cms dose wang et al 2017b when inhibiting silica scaling overdosed antiscalants also cause a detrimental effect demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 ketsetzi et al 2008 ketsetzi et al 2008 used catin to inhibit silica scale in which inhibitor dose over the optimal dose may reduce inhibition activity this result may be due to the aggregation and flocculation effects of the polycationic inhibitor on the negatively charged colloidal silica particles demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 observed the formation of fluffy precipitates when the dose of pei or palam was higher than the optimal dose and correspondingly decreased inhibition performance these cationic polymers are associated with negatively charged colloidal silica particles and thus insoluble silica polymer composites are formed demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 moreover excessive antiscalants in ro systems may be readily adsorbed onto the membrane surface and increase membrane fouling caused by themselves ang et al 2016 gryta 2012 qin et al 2005 yu et al 2019 qin et al 2005 reported that relative fluxes decreased with the increase of dosing flocon 260 a polycarboxylic acid type antiscalant due to the additional organic fouling of this antiscalant a similar phenomenon was observed in the study of yu et al 2019 on the inhibition performance of carboxymethyl cellulose cmc against caso4 the normalized flux slightly decreased after reaching the optimal dose of 2 0 mg l which may be due to the increased adsorption of cmc onto the membrane surface as additional organic foulants yu et al 2019 in summary considering inhibition performance and economic issues optimal dose should be obtained and controlled carefully in accordance with the actual situation 4 2 2 ph solution ph is an important environmental factor that affects inhibition performance because solution ph can change the solubility of many types of mineral scaling and the charge properties of most ionic antiscalants in water prihasto et al 2009 qin et al 2005 tong et al 2019 for example the solubility of common carbonate minerals strongly depends on ph as ph decreases carbonate ions transform into bicarbonate ions and the solubility of bicarbonate minerals increases accordingly prihasto et al 2009 tong et al 2019 qin et al 2005 explored the effect of ph on the scaling control of ro processes for raw feed from a local nickel plating company which contained a high concentration of iron with a high risk of iron scaling they found that a low feed ph resulted in a low fouling tendency of ro membrane which can be attributed to the scaling elimination of iron at low ph by contrast the solubility of amorphous sio2 is relatively constant at near neutral or acidic ph but increases evidently above ph 8 9 milne et al 2014 tong et al 2019 bush et al 2018 investigated the application of ph adjustment pretreatment to prevent silica scaling in the membrane distillation process and the results showed that alkalization and acidification are effective pretreatment strategies for preventing silica scaling if ph can be adjusted higher than 10 or lower than 5 the increasing solubility under alkaline condition is due to the formation of ionic species h3sio4 and h2sio4 2 and the silica polymerization rate under acidic condition is lower compared with neutral and slightly alkaline solutions reducing the formation of insoluble silica bush et al 2018 milne et al 2014 tong et al 2019 antiscalants with ionic functional groups can convert from protonation to deprotonation when ph gradually increases and the interactions between antiscalants and scale forming substances accordingly change influencing inhibition performance ang et al 2016 ruiz agudo et al 2016 yang et al 2010b yang et al 2010c rahardianto et al 2008 compared the effect of initial ph ph0 6 4 and ph0 7 9 considering most feed water is under near neutral conditions on antiscalant effectiveness in ro desalting with high gypsum scaling propensity but no significant variations were found it was because the selected antiscalant permatreat pc 504 has been already at its fully ionized state at ph above 6 0 rahardianto et al 2008 ruiz agudo et al 2016 reported that the binding capacity of a commercial copolymer antiscalant maleic acid allyl sulfonic acid copolymer with phosphonate groups to complex ba2 ion increased with increasing ph this result was probably due to increased deprotonation of the acidic functional groups of the additive at ph 10 relative to ph 6 yang et al 2010b investigated the ph effect of feed water with ca2 ions on bovine serum albumin bsa fouling by using pasp fouling was mitigated at ph 7 0 compared with that at ph 4 9 the isoelectric point of bsa in the absence and presence of pasp due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion between bsa and bsa adsorbed ro membrane at ph 7 0 that led to less accumulation of bsa on the membrane surface in the presence of pasp bsa ca complexes will be uneasily aggregated and accumulated on the membrane surface but stabilized by pasp in water via the possible formation of water soluble bsa ca pasp complexes at high ph yang et al 2010b 4 2 3 temperature temperature exhibits evident changes with the seasons which can also affect scale formation by influencing crystal scale growth mineral solubility mass transfer in ro system biofouling and the interactions between antiscalants and foulants eventually affecting the utilization of antiscalants abdul azis et al 2001 agashichev 2005 jawor and hoek 2009 shakkthivel et al 2004 yang et al 2010a thus temperature effects should be considered in practical situations from eq 1 increasing temperature will increase the nucleation rate when the supersaturation ratio s is kept constant boerlage et al 2002 however solubility can also be influenced by temperature change affecting the supersaturation ratio bott 1997 the nucleation rate is critically dependent on the combined effects of the changes in temperature and s boerlage et al 2002 for common inorganic scales e g caco3 and caso4 the nucleation rate is typically improved with an increase in temperature accelerating scale formation her et al 2000 jawor and hoek 2009 matin et al 2019 shakkthivel et al 2004 due to the minimal effects of temperature on its solubility and supersaturation ratio zhang 2011 shakkthivel et al 2004 conducted and compared scale inhibition tests of acrylonitrile acrylic acid an aa and acrylonitrile methacrylic acid copolymers against caso4 and caco3 scales over a temperature range of 50 c 80 c with an increase in temperature the inhibition efficiency of the two copolymers decreased due to the high scaling tendency at elevated temperatures especially for an aa it acted partially as a coagulant at high temperatures to form precipitates with calcium ions and demonstrated worsened inhibition performance shakkthivel et al 2004 although the nucleation and crystal growth rates typically increase in ro systems water and solute permeability and mass transfer are usually enhanced as temperature increases which can simultaneously reduce energy consumption solute rejection and cp agashichev 2005 found cp resistance decreased and transmembrane flux increased with an increase in temperature using a proposed model jawor and hoek 2009 studied the effects of feed water temperature on flux rejection and inorganic fouling by gypsum scale formation for simulated brackish water the aforementioned opposite effects of a high temperature operation can enable high water recovery and low energy consumption but are accompanied by increased scaling risk jawor and hoek 2009 temperature also plays a significant role in microbial actions and biofouling a relatively high temperature is typically beneficial for bacterial growth and biofouling formation sánchez 2018 yang et al 2010a abdul azis et al 2001 found a high density of biofouling organisms in an intake bay during a summer experiment such high density was presumed to occur due to water quality changes in the bay seasonally and interannually in addition to biofouling itself inorganic scaling can also be affected directly or indirectly by microbial action due to temperature change abdul azis et al 2001 yang et al 2010a yang et al 2010a investigated the seasonal characteristic of seawater ro membrane fouling and showed that biofouling and inorganic fouling were serious in summer the cell multiplication was much more abundant and extracellular polymeric substances eps feature intensity was stronger in summer moreover abundant eps during summer were believed to be the reason for the evident increase in the precipitation of silica and calcium due to the strong capabilities of eps to adsorb these coexisting ions yang et al 2010a thus all the aforementioned effects of temperature must be considered and the use of antiscalants must be adjusted appropriately 4 2 4 coexisting substance in practice various pollutants coexist in treated water the scaling propensity of sparingly soluble salts may be influenced by the existence of other pollutants such as oms and inorganic ions which further affect the utilization of antiscalants matin et al 2019 oms are ubiquitous in all natural water sources with proteins polysaccharides and humics as the three major types of widespread organic foulants wang et al 2016a bsa sodium alginate sa and humic acid ha are generally used as model organic foulants to investigate the effects of oms on scaling as representative of proteins polysaccharides and humics respectively benecke et al 2018 wang et al 2016a wang et al 2016a found that the three pregenerated organic fouling layers bsa ha and sa all reduced the membrane flux compared with virgin membrane in a gypsum dominant nf process ha and sa still acted as nuclei for crystallization leading to higher surface crystallization of gypsum scaling and more serious flux decline than bsa fouled membrane wang et al 2016a benecke et al 2018 reported similar results that scaling from gypsum surface crystallization was enhanced in the presence of sa and ha however the antiscaling effects of various oms in membrane processes were also observed karabelas et al 2017 le gouellec and elimelech 2002a lee et al 2009 several studies have reported that the presence of ha slowed down ro nf membrane flux decline caused by mineral scaling most likely via the complexation effect and adsorption on active sites of the crystal surface le gouellec and elimelech 2002a lee et al 2009 karabelas et al 2017 investigated the effects of sa during the early stage of membrane scaling and its inhibition effect was proven in terms of the reduced deposit density on membranes crystallization rate and crystal shape modification sa was supposed to inhibit the crystallization process likely due to calcium binding with carboxylates of sa karabelas et al 2017 the concentrations of oms in these studies with positive effects on scale inhibition karabelas et al 2017 le gouellec and elimelech 2002a lee et al 2009 were below or equal to 10 0 mg l and those in the aforementioned opposite reports benecke et al 2018 wang et al 2016a 100 0 mg l or 3 0 12 0 mg carbon l were higher than 10 0 mg l this condition may partly explain the difference in the apparent contradictory effects of oms on mineral scaling moreover different feed water characteristics and molecular structural features of oms e g mw also play important roles in the effects of coexisting oms on mineral scaling in ro systems karabelas et al 2020 nielsen et al 2012 identifying the complex interactions involved is crucial for improving the understanding of scaling control in ro operation systems the effects of existing multiple inorganic ions should also be considered given that the existence of these ions may influence scale formation or the inhibition effect of antiscalants rahardianto et al 2008 waly et al 2012 wang et al 2017a rahardianto et al 2008 suggested that gypsum crystal growth in the presence of bicarbonate and the formation of caco3 scale in the gypsum dominant membrane system were retarded they also reported that bicarbonate and antiscalants may synergistically inhibit gypsum scale formation in a ro test due to their adsorption onto gypsum crystals however although caco3 crystallization was apparently suppressed in the presence of gypsum caco3 crystals may nucleate and grow at a slow rate and become observable after a longer period than allowed in the authors study rahardianto et al 2008 yu et al 2019 found flux decline was slightly reduced after the addition of either co3 2 or po4 3 in a gypsum dominant ro process without cmc as antiscalant this result is consistent with rahardianto et al 2008 s report in the presence of cmc the addition of coexisting ions presented nearly no influence on membrane fluxes compared with that without the addition of coexisting ions due to the strong inhibition effect of cmc yu et al 2019 existing studies have shown that coexisting inorganic anions may exert minimal effects on the inhibition performance of antiscalants but do influence the scaling process rahardianto et al 2008 waly et al 2012 yu et al 2019 in addition to inorganic anions metallic ion impurities notably zinc ion can also influence scale precipitation which can hinder caco3 precipitation and change crystal morphology aziz and kasongo 2019 bystrianský et al 2016 ghizellaoui and euvrard 2008 lisitsin et al 2005 aziz and kasongo 2019 compared the inhibition performance of a commercial antiscalant vitec 3000 containing phosphonic acid h2o3p and zinc ions the fluxes after a period of nearly 5 months were 32 78 l m2 h and 30 80 l m2 h for commercial and zinc ion antiscalants which were higher than the untreated flux i e 25 56 l m2 h lisitsin et al 2005 reported a zinc ion concentration of 2 0 mg l was able to achieve an evident suppression effect on the bulk precipitation of caco3 and on membrane scaling waly et al 2012 found that in addition to zinc ions magnesium ions significantly increased the induction time of caco3 crystallization which may be due to the effects of magnesium ions on nucleation and crystal growth through complexation and growth site blocking in contrast with the inhibition effects of zinc ions and magnesium ions mentioned earlier bystrianský et al 2016 reported the presence of iron ions accelerated crystallization of calcium sulfate and led to steeper flux decline in static jar tests and ro tests because of the formation of a solid scalant layer with iron oxides metal ions with high scaling potential such as iron ions should be noted because they will evidently contribute to aggravated membrane fouling in summary the effects of various coexisting substances on scaling have no unified law to follow based on these fragmentary reports the presence of different impurities may have varying influences on scale formation by accelerating or inhibiting crystallization processes which highly depends on the specific characteristics of different systems due to complicated physicochemical interactions involved among dominant scale forming substances antiscalants membranes and coexisting substances in solutions karabelas et al 2020 nielsen et al 2012 in addition these interactions are strongly influenced by the environmental factors mentioned earlier affecting the inhibition performance of antiscalants and the scaling behaviors in actual operations furthermore comprehensive research on the influence of different environmental factors should be conducted to optimize the operation conditions and understand the inhibition mechanisms for guiding the utilization of antiscalants in practical applications 5 applications of antiscalants in ro desalination systems various antiscalants have been developed and applied in water treatment industries such as boiler water cooling water thermal desalination and membrane industries to mitigate scaling chaussemier et al 2015 darton 2000 hasson et al 2011 liu et al 2019 nowack 2003 specific knowledge regarding the performance of different antiscalants in ro processes is beneficial for understanding their mechanisms and optimizing their applications however most of reports and literatures related to those commercial antiscalants were mainly focused on their application performance not antiscalants themselves and their detailed information including the composition purity and concentrations are not provided by manufacturers due to the commercial values making it difficult to thoroughly clarify the role of those commercial antiscalants here the reported performance of various antiscalants applied to different ro processes is primarily summarized in table 3 and elucidated as follows 5 1 phosphorus antiscalants the fact that phosphates can prevent the precipitation of metal ion based minerals by forming a soluble complex with metal ions or and distortion of crystal lattice has been discovered for more than 180 years rashchi and finch 2000 phosphorus antiscalants including phosphates and phosphonates can inhibit scale formation under low concentrations and have been widely applied in various fields nowack 2003 rashchi and finch 2000 they are the most popular antiscalants due to their high effectiveness and are the major commercial antiscalants applied to ro systems al rammah 2000 bonné et al 2000 rahardianto et al 2006 semiat et al 2003 shih et al 2005 shmp is a commonly applied phosphate due to its complexation ability and low cost butt et al 1997 hasson et al 1998 rashchi and finch 2000 hasson et al 1998 conducted preliminary ro tests to compare the degree of scale suppression against caco3 scale provided by calgon shmp and flocon 100 acrylic polyelectrolyte 35 solution flux decline data indicated that 2 0 mg l of calgon can effectively prevent permeability decline for flocon 100 a dose of 3 3 mg l cannot completely suppress scale formation but a dose of 10 0 mg l is necessary for full scale suppression over a test period of approximately 9 h hasson et al 1998 however phosphates occasionally easily hydrolyze into orthophosphate ions which may lead to the formation of calcium phosphate and increase the potential of biofouling thus the use of phosphonates is more common to avoid the inactivity of phosphate based antiscalants because of their hydrolyzation al roomi and hussain 2015 andrews et al 2008 butt et al 1997 li et al 2017 nowack 2003 al rammah 2000 conducted evaluation trials of several acid free antiscalants with phosphonates to replace the combination of sulfuric acid and shmp in a brackish water ro plant the results showed that a phosphino carboxylate based antiscalant m chemical completely inhibited membrane scaling and provided superior performance to the combination of shmp and sulfuric acid due to its higher stability and superior dispersion of silt clay and metal oxides al rammah 2000 rahardianto et al 2006 used a commercial formulation vitec 2000 with a phosphino carboxylic acid polymer as the active ingredient and tested its inhibition performance against gypsum scale under different operation conditions and membrane types inhibition performance increased with an increase in antiscalant dose the membrane area covered by scale decreased and the flux decline caused by scaling was eliminated rahardianto et al 2006 in their other study shih et al 2005 similar conclusions were obtained that the amounts of crystals on the membrane surface decreased as antiscalant dose increased and the size and morphology of surface crystals were changed significantly yang et al 2010b tested the inhibition efficiency of an organophosphorus compound lb 0100 in the control of bsa fouling using a bench scale crossflow ro system the results indicated that bsa fouling can be considerably reduced by properly dosing antiscalants lb 0100 overdosing causes aggravated ro membrane fouling which may result from the reduced water solubility of the formed antiscalant complexes at high antiscalant concentration yang et al 2010b in comparison with previous ph control in scale prevention the application of phosphorus antiscalants evidently reduces and even eliminates the use of acid and alleviates the subsequent corrosion bonné et al 2000 bonné et al 2000 used a commercial organophosphonate antiscalant permatreat 191 in a ro pilot plant to reduce the demand for acid when a small amount of acid was used with an antiscalant dose of 1 4 mg l for the safe control of the desired langelier saturation index lsi due to feed water fluctuations recoveries up to 87 can be obtained without scaling and no membrane cleaning is necessary within a period of 1 year bonné et al 2000 however qin et al 2005 found that the addition of permatreat 191 even enhanced membrane fouling by using spent rinse water from a nickel plating operation after ph adjusted to 4 2 6 8 and another typical polycarboxylic acid type antiscalant flocon 260 did not exhibit an inhibition effect on membrane fouling also which may be due to the complex ingredients of this actual wastewater in addition some commercial antiscalants consist of several active ingredients for high inhibition performance due to the synergistic effect such as combining phosphorus antiscalants with synthetic polymeric antiscalants ang et al 2016 he et al 2009 pramanik et al 2017 semiat et al 2003 semiat et al 2003 assessed the effectiveness of four commercial antiscalants against silica scale on the basis of changes in permeability decline and membrane surface supersaturation level the four antiscalants were two different blends of phosphonates and polymers permatreat 510 and hypersperse si 300ul a multi polymer acumer 5000 and an anionic polyelectrolyte aquafeed ex 105 all four antiscalants increased the threshold limit of the scaling onset from a membrane surface supersaturation level of 1 7 1 9 in the absence of antiscalants to a level of 2 1 2 3 in the presence of antiscalants permatreat 510 exhibited the best inhibition performance among the four antiscalants due to certain synergistic and complementary effects of low molecular and macromolecular inhibitors semiat et al 2003 butt et al 1997 used a synthetic brine to evaluate the efficacy of three inhibitors namely shmp inhibitor a acrylic polymer and inhibitor b polyacrylate pa and phosphonate when treated with the inhibitors the scale forming constituents ca2 sr2 and total alkalinity in solution can remain unchanged for 91 h shmp 50 h inhibitor a and 168 h inhibitor b inhibitor b a composite antiscalant achieved the best inhibition performance because of the synergistic effect butt et al 1997 field and laboratory results obtained by drak et al 2000 indicated that all four tested antiscalants enabled to prevent scaling at a water recovery level below 88 and lsi levels exceeding 2 0 showing good inhibition performance however three composite antiscalants all consisting of phosphonate and paa still presented different inhibition effects indicating the importance of formulating different ingredients in composite antiscalants although various phosphorus antiscalants typically exhibit good inhibition performance in different fields the use of this type of antiscalants should be restricted to reduce phosphorus emissions and the risk of eutrophication of surface waters andrews et al 2008 boels and witkamp 2011 li et al 2017 5 2 synthetic polymeric antiscalants the release of phosphorus from phosphorus antiscalants will cause unfavorable environmental effects therefore the development of new phosphorus free antiscalants has elicited considerable attention andrews et al 2008 boels and witkamp 2011 li et al 2017 various synthetic polymeric antiscalants with different antiscaling functional groups have been prepared based on the homopolymerization or copolymerization of acrylic acid aa maleic acid ma and other functional monomers ghani and al deffeeri 2010 they can effectively prevent scale formation due to chelation dispersion and crystal lattice distortion and thus are used as important ingredients of commercial antiscalants ang et al 2016 ghani and al deffeeri 2010 he et al 2009 polycarboxylic acid is a major class of synthetic polymeric antiscalants including paa polymethacrylic acid polymaleic acid and their bi ter and multi copolymers that contain carboxylic groups al hamzah and fellows 2015 ketrane et al 2009 paa is the most common active ingredient in commercial synthetic polymer antiscalants al hamzah and fellows 2015 ketrane et al 2009 shmulevsky et al 2017 shmulevsky et al 2017 revealed that increased concentrations of a polycarboxylic acid based antiscalant prolonged the induction period obtained from permeate flux data in inhibition of calcium sulfate scaling on ro membranes and led to rough formed crystals due to the crystal distortion effect boerlage et al 2002 reported the application of two pa polymers with different mws in ro pilot plants scaling frequently occurred during the 6 months of operation with antiscalant a2 pa mw 1600 da whereas no scaling was detected during the following 6 months of operation with antiscalant b2 pa mw 3500 da the different inhibition performance of the two pas was partially due to their different mws in addition to changes in environmental conditions boerlage et al 2002 antiscalant b2 with a relatively high mw exhibited an enhanced dispersive property resulting in high performance this finding indicated the importance of the molecular structures of polymeric antiscalants such as mw in their scale inhibition as previously discussed boerlage et al 2002 copolymers with other functional groups apart from carboxylic groups have been developed and applied to improve the inhibition performance of synthetic polymeric antiscalants dietzsch et al 2013 shakkthivel and vasudevan 2006 wang et al 2009 tzotzi et al 2007 assessed the effectiveness of various commercial antiscalants in inhibiting calcium carbonate scale on ro and nf membranes most of these antiscalants exhibited considerable inhibition performance against calcium carbonate on membrane surface by changing the morphology of crystals and reducing the amount of deposits the goodrite k798 additives paa sulfonic acid sulfonated styrene demonstrated significantly better performance compared with k702 paa which may be due to the synergistic effect of various functional groups tzotzi et al 2007 in summary polycarboxylic acid antiscalants are important types of synthetic polymeric antiscalants because carboxylic acid groups play an important role in scale inhibition yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c the introduction of multiple functional groups improves the inhibition performance of this type of antiscalants due to the synergistic inhibition effect however the structure activity relationship of polymeric antiscalants cannot be established clearly and the effects of various structural factors including mw the contents types and distributions of various scaling functional groups and the sequence structures particularly for multi copolymer inhibitors on inhibition performance are still not comprehensively understood insufficient knowledge about polymeric antiscalants in scaling control at the molecular levels largely limits their practical applications 5 3 environment friendly antiscalants synthetic polymeric antiscalants are not easily degradable which may cause a difficulty in the subsequent concentrate disposal and a negative environmental effect due to their emissions hasson et al 2011 thus environment friendly antiscalants have become a popular topic because of their phosphorus free biodegradable and nonharmful properties the inhibition efficiency of pasp pesa and their various derivatives as the most promising green antiscalants has received widespread attention and been reported in many studies chaussemier et al 2015 chen et al 2015a hasson et al 2011 liu et al 2012a pramanik et al 2017 yang et al 2010b yang et al 2010c reported the control of om fouling e g bsa fouling and ha fouling with feed water containing ca2 ions by pasp and several commercial compounds lb 0100 mentioned earlier for bsa fouling and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate na2 edta for ha fouling in ro systems om fouling could be reduced by using a suitable dose of pasp but overdosing had a detrimental effect the presence of ca2 improved the inhibition performance of pasp against om fouling which may be due to the formation of a stable water soluble complex om ca pasp through ca2 bridging yang et al 2010b yang et al 2010c compared with the two commercial compounds pasp exhibited better inhibition effect which might be due to its distinct chemical structures gwak and hong 2017 used an antiscalant blended draw solution with a mixture of nacl and poly aspartic acid sodium salt pasp na in forward osmosis experiments to examine the scaling control effect of the novel strategy gypsum fouling tests demonstrated that the addition of pasp na to the draw solution can effectively control membrane scaling due to the inhibition effect of reversely flowed antiscalant from the blended draw solution gwak and hong 2017 to further improve the inhibition performance of pasp various attempts are ongoing and one of the most common methods is to introduce functional groups via chemical modification chen et al 2015a gao et al 2015 pramanik et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c 2017 pramanik et al 2017 synthesized a pasp derivative pasp sea asp by introducing sulfonic acid and carboxylic acid to the side chain of pasp and tested its scale inhibition performance on the desalination of synthetic brackish water using a polyamide ro membrane the results showed that compared with a commercial phosphorus antiscalant pasp sea asp and pasp achieved higher improvement in water recovery pasp sea asp was more effective than pasp due to the enhanced chelation ability from the introduced sulfonic acid groups pramanik et al 2017 apart from pasp the scale inhibition efficiency of other green antiscalants derived from natural polymers chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 such as oxidized starch guo et al 2013 cms wang et al 2017b starch graft polyacrylic acid st g paa yu et al 2018 cmc kavitskaya et al 2000 yu et al 2019 and cmi akin et al 2008 boels and witkamp 2011 has also been investigated the inhibition performance of these antiscalants has been evaluated using static jar tests and ro tests and the results are comparable with those of commercial antiscalants yu et al 2019 prepared a series of cmc with different degrees of substitution ds and investigated its role in mitigating gypsum scaling on ro membranes similar to reported results ang et al 2016 gryta 2012 yang et al 2010b yang et al 2010c an appropriate dose was necessary for cmc to achieve remarkable inhibition performance the optimal dose decreased with an increase in ds but remained nearly unchanged when ds was more than a certain value this result indicated that a suitable ds was important to achieve good inhibition efficiency and minimize the production cost of antiscalants yu et al 2019 moreover the inhibition performance of cmc was as good as those of paa and amino trimethylene phosphonic acid atmp implying that natural polymer derivatives have remarkable potential as efficient environment friendly antiscalants yu et al 2019 in summary the applications of antiscalants to membrane scaling control particularly field operation data are still limited and widespread use of scale inhibitors in ro systems awaits considerable laboratory and field operation experiences antiscalants especially environment friendly inhibitors applied to ro membrane processes exhibits the advantages of convenient operation low device cost minimal equipment damage and highly effective inhibition performance compared with the conventional pretreatment methods mentioned earlier darton 2000 li et al 2011 tong et al 2019 however additional knowledge about polymeric antiscalants in scaling control particularly at the molecular levels is urgently required for optimized applications in their practical operations 6 existing problems and perspectives various antiscalants their applications to ro membrane scaling control and their advantages and disadvantages have been reviewed and discussed in this paper although antiscalants play a significant role in preventing membrane scaling many challenges practical problems and weakness of existing antiscalants such as enhanced bacterial growth appropriate dosing control and final concentrate disposal exist in their applications greenlee et al 2009b greenlee et al 2010a greenlee et al 2010b 2011 joo and tansel 2015 malaeb and ayoub 2011 mccool et al 2012 2013 pérez gonzález et al 2012 subramani and jacangelo 2014 sweity et al 2013 2014 2015 turek et al 2017 vrouwenvelder et al 2000 to improve the effectiveness of antiscalants in ro membrane scaling control ongoing research can focus on the development of novel high performance and environment friendly antiscalants on the basis of an in depth study of the inhibition mechanisms and well established structure activity relationships obtained from a comprehensive understanding of the molecular structures of antiscalants and the involved interactions among antiscalants scale forming substances membranes and other coexisting matters in solutions karabelas et al 2020 liu et al 2019 matin et al 2019 6 1 existing problems with regard to the practical applications of antiscalants to ro membrane processes several problems that limit and influence the utilization of antiscalants such as enhanced bacterial growth appropriate dosing control and concentrate disposal should be emphasized greenlee et al 2009b greenlee et al 2010a greenlee et al 2010b 2011 joo and tansel 2015 malaeb and ayoub 2011 mccool et al 2012 2013 pérez gonzález et al 2012 subramani and jacangelo 2014 sweity et al 2013 2014 2015 turek et al 2017 vrouwenvelder et al 2000 6 1 1 enhanced biofouling antiscalants can effectively inhibit scale formation through the interactions between functional groups and scale forming substances however antiscalants may also alter the physical chemical surface properties of membranes via adsorption particularly at overdoses which will enhance membrane biofouling sweity et al 2013 2014 2015 in particular membrane surface charge roughness and hydrophobicity are important factors that influence membrane organic fouling and biofilm formation these properties of membrane surface can be affected by the adsorption of antiscalants promoting membrane organic fouling and attachment of bacterial cells onto the surface ang et al 2016 sweity et al 2013 2014 2015 common commercial phosphorus based antiscalants are also a nutritional source for bacterial growth sweity et al 2013 2015 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 sweity et al 2013 tested the contribution of two common antiscalants i e polyphosphonate and pa based ones to membrane biofouling in the ro desalination process and the effects of antiscalants on membrane surface properties and bacterial adhesion were studied the results indicated that the addition of both types of antiscalants increased biofilm formation rate on membrane surface but followed different mechanisms the pa based antiscalant may enhance initial cell attachment and deposition by altering the polyamide surface more hydrophobic promoting biofilm formation the polyphosphonate based antiscalant was considered as an additional source of phosphorous to enhance biofilm formation rate sweity et al 2013 accordingly bacterial growth can be enhanced not only by phosphorous based antiscalants but also by synthetic polymeric antiscalants ashfaq et al 2019 bonné et al 2000 vrouwenvelder et al 2000 vrouwenvelder et al 2000 tested the biofouling potential of 14 antiscalants with an easily assimilable organic carbon test and a biomass production potential test the used chemicals exerted different effects on promoting biological growth with the paa based antiscalant a achieving the greatest promoting growth potential antiscalant a 2 5 mg l caused a significant increase in the normalized pressure drop approximately 60 within 11 days vrouwenvelder et al 2000 bonné et al 2000 used a combination of acid and antiscalant flocon 100 to prevent the formation of caco3 and baso4 scales in a ro plant although the combination was successful for scale inhibition with acid and antiscalant dosing the frequency of membrane cleaning was once every 4 6 weeks flocon 100 may be related to frequent cleaning because it was beneficial for biological growth and biofouling as a nutrient bonné et al 2000 these widely used antiscalants mostly consist of organic compounds combined with the influence on membrane surface properties the problem of enhanced biofouling should be focused on and mitigated as mentioned earlier the use of phosphorus antiscalants should be reduced to avoid their effect on enhancing bacterial growth in addition to decreasing the risk of water eutrophication and algal bloom the development of novel environment friendly antiscalants with high purification and enhanced inhibition performance that require low doses is desirable for mitigating enhanced biofouling in addition the combination of antibacterial units with antiscalants can be optimized to control membrane biofouling and scaling 6 1 2 dosing control as mentioned earlier dose plays an important role in the inhibition performance of antiscalants and inappropriate dosing will not only lead to increased membrane fouling but will also reduce inhibition efficiency kelle zeiher et al 2003 in addition to various methods for identifying the incipient scaling as mentioned in section 2 1 2 karabelas et al 2020 van de lisdonk et al 2001 antiscalant monitoring is essential for the appropriate dosing of antiscalants also conventional monitoring methods include colorimetric spectrometric turbidimetric and potentiometric techniques and the use of fluorescent tracers andrews et al 2008 darton 2000 feng et al 2014 kelle zeiher et al 2003 wang et al 2014 yuchi et al 2007 in contrast with acid dosing or softening which can be easily monitored using ph or ion selective electrodes most of these monitoring methods are troublesome and require measurements using large scale instruments kelle zeiher et al 2003 yuchi et al 2007 summarized the conventional methods for monitoring the concentration of a widely used antiscalant pa including 1 monitoring a spectral change based on the interaction of pa with certain substances e g metal reagent complex metachromic or fluorochromic dye 2 monitoring the concentration of an inert tracer added in proportion to pa via potentiometry or spectrophotometry e g li k br i transition metal ion dye 3 monitoring the intensity of fluorescence emitted from a tag covalently bound to pa and 4 monitoring turbidity change on the interaction of pa with a cationic surfactant several of these methods are inapplicable to rapid on site and online evaluation fluorescent molecule monitoring based on combining a fluorescent molecule with antiscalants has been reported to allow the online monitoring of antiscalant concentration using simple online equipment kelle zeiher et al 2003 the results showed that the use of fluorescent technology made the automated monitoring and control of antiscalant dosing effective kelle zeiher et al 2003 although fluorescent molecule technology has been successfully applied to cooling water systems the compatibility of added fluorescent molecules with the membrane surface must be considered for a membrane system apart from combining fluorescent molecules with antiscalants the synthesis of fluorescent antiscalant through the copolymerization of a monomer with a fluorescent chromophore and other monomers or modifying polymers using fluorescent groups is another useful method for introducing fluorescence characteristics feng et al 2014 wang et al 2014 feng et al 2014 introduced carbazole groups into pasp to obtain fluorescent poly aspartic acid fpasp the results showed that the relationship between the concentration of fpasp and the fluorescence intensity was linear which provided the possibility of auto dosing with fpasp feng et al 2014 appropriate dosing control reduces the risk of underdosing and overdosing making the use of antiscalants in ro systems effective apart from fluorescent tracer technology antiscalant detection requires further research to explore more effective dosing control methods 6 1 3 concentrate disposal the generated concentrate from ro systems requires further reasonable treatment joo and tansel 2015 subramani and jacangelo 2014 and controlled precipitation is a promising approach greenlee et al 2010b nevertheless the presence of antiscalants in the concentrate may adversely affect concentrate disposal due to the anti precipitation effect of antiscalants greenlee et al 2010a greenlee et al 2010b 2011 mccool et al 2012 greenlee et al 2010a performed precipitation experiments using a synthetic ro concentrate to investigate the effects of antiscalant type antiscalant concentration and precipitation ph on caco3 precipitation and filtration processes the results indicated that adding antiscalants can change the shape of precipitate particles and decrease particle size increasing mf flux decline in the succeeding separation step the mass of precipitated particles was also reduced due to the presence of antiscalants during precipitation greenlee et al 2010a greenlee et al 2010b also tried several synthetic concentrates in the presence of different compositions such as mg2 and so4 2 in which antiscalant dosing increased magnesium and sulfate precipitation and decreased calcium precipitation the adsorption of antiscalants onto the formed caco3 crystals was speculated to inhibit crystal growth and allow increased magnesium and sulfate to be incorporated into the formed caco3 greenlee et al 2010b the same group applied the advanced oxidation process aop of ozonation and hydrogen peroxide to the degradation of phosphonate antiscalants to eliminate the detrimental effect of antiscalants in the concentrate precipitation process greenlee et al 2011 the results showed that aop removed the effects of antiscalants on the mass size and morphology of precipitation particles and improved mf performance in the succeeding separation stage in some cases greenlee et al 2011 xu et al 2019 used ozonation treatment to remove 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtca and the results showed that the antiprecipitation effect of the antiscalant was gradually reduced with increasing ozonation time boels et al 2012 investigated the adsorption and desorption of atmp onto granular ferric hydroxide gfh from ro membrane concentrate the results indicated that the presence of calcium increased the surface coverage of phosphonates and substantially increased the adsorption rate gfh is reusable after regeneration with sodium hydroxide solution indicating that it is a promising adsorbent for the removal and recovery of atmp from ro membrane concentrates boels et al 2012 antiscalants increase the difficulties of concentrate disposal hence an appropriate concentrate pretreatment that can remove or degrade antiscalants is favorable for improving the performance of the succeeding concentrate treatment antiscalants particularly biodegradable ones easily degrade under certain conditions such as using enzyme catalysis which may be notably advantageous to final concentrate disposal in summary the effects of antiscalants on concentrate disposal have not been fully studied and effective methods to mitigate their adverse effects are still rare in depth studies are necessary to improve the understanding of the role of antiscalants in concentrate disposal and the optimization of the entire ro system 6 2 perspectives 6 2 1 optimizing the application of antiscalants in ro process in spite of the effective scaling control of antiscalants in ro systems many problems are associated with the real applications of antiscalants as mentioned earlier considerable research effort has been devoted to the improvement and optimization of antiscalants applied to ro systems ashfaq et al 2019 feng et al 2014 sweity et al 2015 xu et al 2019 first suitable antiscalants should be selected in accordance with feed water characteristics such as ph and composition and the structural features of the selected membrane the optimization of ro operational conditions such as crossflow velocity applied pressure hydrodynamic conditions and target recovery setting is important in practical applications antony et al 2011 goh et al 2018 greenlee et al 2009a tong et al 2019 for the operation of antiscalants rapid adjustment of antiscalants dose in accordance with the results of membrane scaling monitoring and antiscalant dosing monitoring can avoid potential aggravated scaling due to available changes in feed water characteristics and environmental conditions thus monitoring methods for membrane scaling and antiscalant dosing control technologies are essential and should be further developed feng et al 2014 karabelas et al 2020 kelle zeiher et al 2003 van de lisdonk et al 2001 the combination of antiscalants with other ro related pretreatments also plays an important role in optimizing the utilization of antiscalants besides the inhibition performance of antiscalants can be further improved using modified membrane installation design and operation both of which can more efficiently remove scale forming substances from treated water and largely reduce the antiscalants doses however researches on exploring the synergistic effects of antiscalants with other pretreatments and different ro units on the improvement of the whole ro operation performance is notably necessary 6 2 2 environment friendliness of antiscalants apart from the aforementioned strategies in practical operations the development of novel high performance and environment friendly antiscalants should be the most critical point that requires additional attention to obtain high scaling control performance phosphorus antiscalants should be used less or completely discarded because of their evident harmfulness to the environment regardless of their good inhibition performance phosphorus free antiscalants particularly biodegradable ones have greater prospects in real applications due to their significant environment impact and their distinct antiscaling performance besides the difficulties of concentrate disposal may be solved by using easily biodegradable antiscalants instead of those synthetic antiscalants which would avoid that the presence of antiscalants can hamper complicate mining the elements in the brine in addition to pasp and pesa polysaccharides including starch cellulose chitosan and alginate are considered good candidates used as efficient antiscalants because of their significantly environment friendly features however studies on the development of novel polysaccharide based antiscalants and their applications to ro systems particularly field operation are lacking 6 2 3 fabrication of high performance antiscalants a high performance material must be designed and fabricated on the basis of the structure activity relationship and its application mechanisms ashby et al 2013 wessel 2004 suitable antiscalants with desired molecular structures can be accordingly obtained by using various chemical methods chen et al 2015b edgar et al 2001 heinze and liebert 2001 kang et al 2015 roy et al 2009 however previous studies related to inhibition mechanisms were mostly superficial and focused on qualitative description by contrast quantitative analyses are rare wang et al 2017b yu et al 2018 2019 this condition may be attributed to two facts the first is the lack of an in depth understanding of antiscalants molecular structures particularly polymeric antiscalants causing difficulty in studying the inhibition performance of antiscalants at the molecular levels and establishing the structure activity relationship for example the sequence structures of copolymers with more than two comonomers are difficult to determine using currently available structural characterization methods kang et al 2015 roy et al 2009 hence precise characterization awaits the development of advanced technologies and sophisticated analytical instruments the other fact is the lack of understanding of the complicated physicochemical interactions involved among dominant scale forming substances antiscalants membranes and other coexisting substances in solutions karabelas et al 2020 matin et al 2019 in previous studies researchers derived various inhibition mechanisms including chelation dispersion and crystal distortion qualitatively based on apparent inhibition behavior and available interactions in fact quantitative or semiquantitative details such as the degrees of their various interactions and the delayed and or inhibited kinetic processes of inorganic scale crystallization should be studied in depth at the molecular levels to guide the development of effective antiscalants in addition to the effects of antiscalants on the scaling ions and or formed scales when they are applied to ro systems the effects of antiscalants on the membrane should not be disregarded possible interfacial interactions between antiscalants and membrane surface such as electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and π π electron donor acceptor interactions can alter membrane surface properties influence membrane separation performance and even cause membrane fouling the design and preparation of antiscalants with enhanced inhibition effects but weakened fouling on the basis of the detailed evaluation of their available involved multiple interactions are interesting topics this knowledge can be obtained from the comprehensive analysis of the molecular structural characteristics of scaling ions formed scales membranes and antiscalants however it is a quite complicated process to acquire a high performance practical antiscalant from laboratory to market which still require close cooperation between relevant scientists and engineers 7 conclusion in summary 1 antiscalants particularly environment friendly ones have a wide application prospect in ro membrane scaling control due to their notable advantages as mentioned earlier 2 the novel and high performance antiscalants can be designed and fabricated on the basis of the well established structure activity and 3 remarkable achievements will be obtained through efforts in the optimization of practical applications of antiscalants also such achievements can favor the extensive applications of antiscalants to membrane scaling control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

membrane based desalination processes to alleviate the water shortage due to its low energy consumption and high efficiency fritzmann et al 2007 however membrane fouling poses an obstacle to the application of ro desalination processes membrane fouling can be divided into four types particulate fouling organic fouling inorganic fouling and biofouling andrews et al 2008 fritzmann et al 2007 goh et al 2018 guo et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 malaeb and ayoub 2011 matin et al 2019 inorganic fouling which generally refers to mineral scaling is a challenging problem due to the high amount of total dissolved solids of feed water and the nearly complete salt rejection andrews et al 2008 when salt concentration increases and exceeds the solubility of sparingly soluble salts scale formation from bulk and surface crystallization easily occurs causing membrane blocking and the deterioration of membrane performance common mineral scaling includes metal ion based scales which are mostly alkaline earth metal based scales and silica based scales matin et al 2019 oh et al 2009 tong et al 2019 to mitigate the risk of membrane scaling many methods including feed water pretreatment the optimization of operational processes the development of novel membrane materials and the addition of antiscalants have been developed in accordance with the characteristics of ro operating systems

have been popular issues because membrane fouling is closely related to membrane surface properties goh et al 2018 tong et al 2019 zhang et al 2016b tong et al 2019 summarized existing pieces of evidence that prove the importance of membrane surface properties in regulating mineral scale formation during membrane desalination and discussed the challenges experienced in the design and fabrication of novel scaling resistant membranes besides the addition of antiscalants is one of the most commonly applied methods for inhibiting scaling in the ro process especially in the situation that a high water recovery is set to reduce concentrate volume but cause an enhanced scaling potential due to its high efficiency low cost and easy operation darton 2000 rahardianto et al 2007 tong et al 2019 antiscalants comprise a class of water treatment agents that can inhibit scale formation through one or more effective mechanisms such as chelation dispersion crystal distortion and threshold darton 2000 li et al 2011 many reports have confirmed that the use of antiscalants in ro processes can effectively mitigate scale formation and assure the long term stable operation of ro systems al shammiri et al 2000 darton 2000 fritzmann et al 2007 greenlee et al 2009a tong et al 2019 thus a comprehensive understanding of the effects and mechanisms of antiscalants in ro systems will be extremely helpful in improving antiscalants performance and availability in fact research on the applications and mechanisms of antiscalants to ro systems remains unsystematic although the addition of antiscalants to ro systems has been confirmed and classified as one of the popular pretreatment methods in many studies anis et al 2019 greenlee et al 2009a henthorne and boysen 2015 jamaly et al 2014 qasim et al 2019 tong et al 2019 however most previous reviews focused on the development of novel antiscalants and their traditional applications to the boiler water and cooling water industries chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 thus this work presented exhaustive knowledge about the applications and mechanisms of antiscalants to ro systems the effects of various internal and external factors on the scale formation and the antiscalants performance were summarized finally the problems caused by existing antiscalants and the limitations and prospects of antiscalants in practical ro applications were discussed in detail scheme 1 describes the overview of various antiscalants and their applications in ro membrane scaling control 2 scale inhibition mechanisms 2 1 scale formation and growth kinetics 2 1 1 scale formation mineral scaling can be approximately categorized into metal ion and silica based scales based on the characteristics of their chemical components matin et al 2019 tong et al 2019 metal ion based scale including calcium carbonate magnesium carbonate calcium sulfate and barium sulfate is generally formed via crystallization the formation of scales i e the growth of crystal occurs as described in fig 2 1 when the salt concentration is over the solubility of sparingly soluble salts the ions start colliding to form ion pairs and cluster as micronuclei 2 some of the micronuclei become nucleation centers and then ion clusters begin aligning in an orderly manner to form stable nuclei 3 crystals grow gradually from nuclei and this process is irreversible al roomi and hussain 2016 darton 2000 matin et al 2019 silica based scale can be classified into silica scaling and metal silicates ning 2002 topçu et al 2017 the formation of silica based scale is a complex process resulting from silica polymerization and the accumulation of amorphous colloidal silica which depends on various conditions including ph temperature ionic strength the presence of multivalent ions and the silica concentration bush et al 2018 milne et al 2014 silica polymerization is considered to occur via dehydration and formation of si o si anhydride bonds n si oh 4 oh 3si o si oh 3 dimer oligomers colloidal polymers infinite extensions sio2 n as shown in fig 3 ketsetzi et al 2008 milne et al 2014 ning 2002 weng 1995 zhang et al 2012 the existence of multivalent cations in a silica containing solution is one of main causes to decrease the solubility of silica and easily form metal silicates due to the interactions between multivalent cations and silicate anions resulting in scale formation even at concentrations below silica saturation milne et al 2014 ning 2002 weng 1995 in ro systems the widely accepted membrane scaling can be classified into bulk homogeneous crystallization and surface heterogeneous crystallization as shown in fig 4 goh et al 2018 matin et al 2019 oh et al 2009 qasim et al 2019 shirazi et al 2010 on the one hand solutions are concentrated several times in accordance with water recovery when salt concentration increases and exceeds the solubility of sparingly soluble salts scales are formed in the solutions namely the products of bulk crystallization and deposited onto membrane surface causing membrane blocking on the other hand scales can directly form and grow on membrane surface under enhanced concentration polarization and salt supersaturation matin et al 2019 the prevailing scale formation in ro process is influenced by several factors such as supersaturation level feed water characteristics and hydrodynamics generally bulk crystallization is more obvious at high supersaturation level and low crossflow velocity matin et al 2019 surface crystallization is closely related not only to supersaturation level but also to concentration polarization on the membrane surface goh et al 2018 matin et al 2019 semiat et al 2001 shirazi et al 2010 silica scaling in ro systems is similar to the metal ion based scale formation in the two crystallization processes mentioned earlier including deposits of amorphous colloidal silica and direct scaling on membrane surface 2 1 2 scale growth kinetics scale crystal growth kinetics which is based on the online observation and monitoring of the entire crystallization processes is an extremely useful method for investigating the detailed scaling process agarwal and berglund 2004 the measurements of changes in bulk fluid properties such as turbidity conductivity ion concentration and ph are typically applied to obtain the information of induction time t ind and crystal growth rate r abdel aal et al 2015 fischer et al 2011 lee et al 2015 olderøy et al 2009 rabizadeh et al 2017 on the basis of classic nucleation theory boerlage et al 2002 dydo et al 2004 hasson et al 2003 manoli and dalas 2001 mullin 2001 the nucleation rate j can be expressed by 1 j a exp β γ 3 v m 2 f θ k 3 t 3 ln s 2 where a is a frequency factor β is a geometric shape factor of 16π 3 for the spherical nucleus and f θ is a correction factor which is equal to 1 0 for homogeneous nucleation and to 1 0 for heterogeneous nucleation hasson et al 2003 several researchers abdel aal et al 2015 el shall et al 2005 have used f θ 0 01 to estimate the heterogeneous nucleation rate v m is the molar volume of the phase forming and γ is the surface energy j m2 s is the supersaturation ratio k is the boltzmann constant and t is the absolute temperature the induction time t ind is inversely proportional to j hasson et al 2001 2003 liu et al 2019 and the relation between t ind and s can be written as 2 ln t i n d b β γ 3 v m 2 f θ k 3 t 3 ln s 2 where b is a constant thus surface energy can be determined experimentally by measuring the slope of the straight line that correlates lnt ind with 1 lns 2 for surface crystallization surface crystallization can be greatly enhanced by concentration polarization on the membrane surface in addition to supersaturation level goh et al 2018 matin et al 2019 semiat et al 2001 shirazi et al 2010 concentration polarization refers to the phenomenon in which a boundary layer exists near the membrane surface within which solute concentration is higher than bulk solute concentration due to the convective flow from the bulk feed toward the membrane surface qasim et al 2019 the concentration polarization level cp can be expressed by hasson et al 2001 2003 matin et al 2019 sutzkover et al 2000 3 c p c m c b e j v k m where c m and c b are the salt concentrations at the membrane surface and bulk solution respectively j v is the permeate flux and k m is the mass transfer coefficient the evaluation of cp requires estimating the mass transfer coefficient k m sutzkover et al 2000 reported a simple technique to determine k m and cp in a ro system k m is given by 4 k m j v s a l t ln δ p π b π p 1 j v s a l t j v h 2 o where π b and π p are the osmotic pressure of the saline feed and the permeate respectively j v h2o and j v salt are the permeate flux of the salt free water and the saline solution respectively and δp is the transmembrane pressure c m can be estimated using eq 3 then the supersaturation ratio in the membrane system s w that prevails on the membrane surface for a type of sparingly soluble salt axby can be calculated using the following equation 5 s w c a m y c b m x k s p c p c a b y c p c b b x k s p c p x y c a b y c b b x k s p where c a m and c b m refer to membrane surface concentration c a b and c b b refer to bulk concentration and k sp is the solubility product in summary the supersaturation level for a certain salt on a membrane surface can be obtained in accordance with cp based on eqs 3 5 high cp can lead to a high solute concentration in the boundary layer causing increased osmotic pressure and supersaturation level which enhance membrane surface crystallization and increase the risk of scaling and reducing permeate flux matin et al 2019 qasim et al 2019 in general increased applied pressure and water recovery can lead to severe concentration polarization a high crossflow velocity can move formed particles away from the membrane surface and reduce concentration polarization goh et al 2018 matin et al 2019 qasim et al 2019 shirazi et al 2010 the surface energy for a process of surface nucleation on membrane surface can be also estimated using t ind and the obtained s w based on eq 2 when eqs 2 and 5 are combined the following equation that reflects membrane surface crystallization based on cp can be obtained as 6 ln t i n d b β γ 3 v m 2 f θ k 3 t 3 ln c p x y c a b y c b b x k s p 2 from eqs 2 and 6 determining the onset of membrane scaling and t ind is crucial for investigating the membrane scaling process hasson et al 2001 2003 extracted t ind data from plots of permeate flux versus time which were successfully correlated with the supersaturation level based on nucleation theory the membrane scaling can be assessed by t ind and obtained crystallization surface energy however difficulties and uncertainties remain in determining t ind on the membrane surface heterogeneous nucleation on membrane surface is clearly favored which causes surface crystallization even at low supersaturation levels hence incipient membrane scaling may not cause an evident change in the measured bulk fluid properties or permeate flux karabelas et al 2020 van de lisdonk et al 2001 presented a supersaturation prediction model aiming at monitoring the early stage of scaling which can calculate the supersaturation ratio of sparingly soluble salts on membrane surface the scaling monitor was proved to be able to detect scaling before it occurred in the last stage of the pilot plant besides real time membrane observation is a sensitive method for identifying incipient scaling but with limitations in spatial resolution karabelas et al 2020 reliable techniques for monitoring incipient scaling are important for the quantitative assessment of antiscalant inhibitory effectiveness in ro systems and further effort is required to develop useful monitoring methods 2 2 normal inhibition mechanisms 2 2 1 metal ion based scale different mineral scales have various features and follow different inhibition mechanisms in general antiscalants can typically influence bulk crystallization of metal ion base scale by interfering with one or more of the crystallization stages because these chemical agents with various functional groups such as phosphonic carboxylic and sulfonic groups can interact with scale forming substances and inhibit scale formation through one or more of the widely accepted inhibition mechanisms which include chelation dispersion lattice distortion and threshold effects as summarized in table 2 al roomi and hussain 2016 amjad 2014 darton 2000 dobberschütz et al 2018 li et al 2011 rahman 2013 chelation refers to the complexation of antiscalants with scale forming cations via a stoichiometric reaction which can increase the solubility of sparingly soluble salts al roomi and hussain 2016 darton 2000 dispersion effect is that antiscalants are adsorbed onto crystals generally providing them with surface charge and causing mineral crystals to repel one another through steric interactions keeping them dispersed in the solution al roomi and hussain 2016 darton 2000 li et al 2011 for enveloping crystals and providing them with surface charge antiscalants with a relatively high molecular weight mw 20 000 da are suitable as effective dispersants darton 2000 antiscalants can disrupt the crystallization process by interacting with mineral nuclei inhibiting and or distorting crystal growth al roomi and hussain 2016 darton 2000 li et al 2011 liu et al 2019 the formed crystal morphologies can be changed due to the adsorption of antiscalants called lattice distortion influencing the clustering process and preventing the precipitation of sparingly soluble salts via sub stoichiometric amounts of antiscalants is considered threshold effect darton 2000 ketrane et al 2009 the inhibition and distortion of scale formation in the crystal growth process are caused by the adsorption of antiscalants onto the active sites of crystal surfaces exploring the adsorption behavior of antiscalants on crystal surfaces can provide in depth understanding of scale inhibition mechanisms the coverage θ of antiscalants on the crystal surface can changed the crystal growth rate in the absence of antiscalants r 0 to r i as shown in the following equation akin et al 2008 kırboğa and öner 2009 nielsen et al 2012 7 r i r 0 1 θ the adsorption behavior can be investigated by fitting the experimental data that correspond to different antiscalant concentrations with a suitable adsorption isothermal model accordingly the adsorption constant can be obtained and compared akin et al 2008 kırboğa and öner 2009 lin and singer 2005 nielsen et al 2012 langmuir type model has been widely used to interpret the decrease in growth rates of some sparingly soluble salts in the presence of antiscalants and the coverage θ for this adsorption model is described by the following equation akin et al 2008 kırboğa and öner 2009 nielsen et al 2012 8 θ k c i 1 k c i where k is the affinity constant which is the ratio of the rate constants for adsorption and desorption k ads k des and c i is the total equilibrium concentration of an antiscalant from eqs 7 and 8 the relationship between r i and c i can be given as 9 r 0 r 0 r i 1 1 k c i the affinity constant k can be obtained from the slope of the linear relationship between r 0 r 0 r i and 1 c i as a measure of the adsorption affinity of antiscalants on the crystal surface akin et al 2008 studied the effect of carboxymethyl inulin cmi on the crystal growth of calcium oxalate the results indicated that t ind increased and r i decreased with increasing carboxyl content on the polymer backbone the adsorption of polymeric antiscalants on the crystal can be fitted in a langmuir type isothermal model the obtained affinity constant was high for the cmi with a high carboxylation degree which may reflect its strong adsorption onto the crystal surface akin et al 2008 molecular dynamics simulations have also been conducted to investigate the interaction between the crystal surface and additives chen et al 2013 ji et al 2017 shen et al 2018 shi et al 2012 2013 2017 zhang et al 2016a the binding energy e b of antiscalants on the crystal surface can be computed using the following equation 10 e b e a d s e s y s t e m e s u r f a c e e a n t i s c a l a n t where e system is the total energy of the antiscalant surface system e surface is the energy of the crystal surface and e antiscalant is the energy of the free antiscalant molecule the larger the binding energy the more favorable the interactions between the crystal surface and the antiscalant shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2016a this method can provide a theoretical basis for the interaction between antiscalant and crystal surface at the molecular level in addition to bulk crystallization the addition of antiscalants may inhibit surface crystallization by changing the surface energy of heterogeneous nucleation and decreasing the nucleation rate which can be reflected by eq 6 hasson et al 2001 2003 however antiscalants can also influence surface crystallization via adsorption onto membrane surface and alteration of membrane surface properties sometimes causing aggravated membrane scaling which would be discussed in detail later ang et al 2016 benecke et al 2018 2 2 2 silica based scale given the considerable difference between silica scaling and metal silicates the required antiscalants and the corresponding inhibition mechanisms are quite different for metal silicates similar to the aforementioned popular metal ion based scale the interactions of antiscalants with multivalent cations should be the primary inhibition mechanisms the antiscalants that contain anionic groups may increase the solubility of metal silicates by interacting with multivalent cations topçu et al 2017 thus preventing the formation of metal silicates for silica scaling the inhibition mechanisms mostly include interfering with the silica polymerization process and dispersing colloidal silica particles weng 1995 zhang et al 2011 the surface charges of various silica species are negative within a wide ph region due to the deprotonation of surface silanol groups schindler et al 1976 sjöberg 1996 weng 1995 zhang et al 2011 conventional antiscalants that contain anionic groups thus exhibit nearly no inhibition efficiency against silica scale goh et al 2018 neofotistou and demadis 2004b zhang et al 2011 it is expected that positively charged antiscalants can interact with negatively charged silica via electrostatic attraction thereby not only interfering with the polymerization of silica monomers or soluble silica oligomers but also dispersing colloidal silica particles and preventing their agglomeration as shown in fig 5 topçu et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 3 antiscalants 3 1 phosphorus antiscalants antiscalants can be approximately classified into phosphorus and phosphorus free antiscalants al roomi and hussain 2016 hasson et al 2011 he et al 2009 ketrane et al 2009 li et al 2011 phosphorus antiscalants include phosphates and phosphonates nowack 2003 rashchi and finch 2000 the two structures are different phosphates are defined as compounds that contain p o linkage with the orthophosphate ion po4 3 as the basic building unit rashchi and finch 2000 such as sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate shmp as shown in fig 6 phosphonates are compounds containing one or more c po oh 2 groups which are more stable than phosphates due to the existence of stable covalent c p bond nowack 2003 the structures of some typical phosphonates are presented in fig 7 phosphates and phosphonates can be both used as complexing agents in many applications due to their excellent complexing ability although phosphate was found to prevent scale formation or dissolve precipitates by forming relatively stable soluble complexes with metal ions as early as the end of the 19th century rashchi and finch 2000 phosphates easily hydrolyze into orthophosphate ions which may form precipitates with calcium ions and increase the potential of biofouling al roomi and hussain 2015 andrews et al 2008 darton 2000 ghani and al deffeeri 2010 li et al 2017 phosphonates thus have a wider range of applications because of their structural stability in short as the most popular inhibitors phosphorus inhibitors including phosphates and phosphonates account for a large share in the antiscalants market considering their good cost effective performance gryta 2012 lin and singer 2005 with increasing focus on environmental issues phosphorus emissions that will lead to heavy eutrophication and increased biofouling have been receiving considerable attention and thus their utilization is gradually restricted al roomi and hussain 2015 3 2 synthetic polymeric antiscalants the development of low phosphorus or phosphorus free scale inhibitors has become a major issue to reduce phosphorus emissions from the use of antiscalants phosphorus antiscalants have been partly replaced with synthetic polymeric scale inhibitors without phosphorus for common metal ion based scale the carboxylic group on the polymeric backbone is an effective functional group for inhibiting scale formation yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c the class of polycarboxylic acid inhibitors synthesized through the polymerization of monomers that contain carboxylic groups can interact with scale forming substances via carboxylic groups and efficiently prevent scale formation al hamzah et al 2014 kavitha et al 2011 senthilmurugan et al 2010 tang et al 2008 in addition to carboxylic groups inhibitors that contain multiple types of functional groups exhibit better inhibition performance due to synergistic effects compared with those with a single functional group such as hydroxyl sulfonic amino and ether groups chen et al 2015a dietzsch et al 2013 shakkthivel and vasudevan 2006 yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c the introduction of multiple types of functional groups into polymeric antiscalants via the copolymerization of various monomers increases water solubility and improves the dispersion effect of polymers enhancing the inhibition performance of antiscalants dietzsch et al 2013 gao et al 2015 li et al 2017 shakkthivel and vasudevan 2006 yang et al 2017 some typical anionic monomers used in the synthesis of antiscalants are presented in fig 8 these synthetic polymeric antiscalants can effectively chelate with metal ions and disperse microcrystal particles in solutions due to the existence of hydrophilic anionic groups and thus show excellent scale inhibition efficiency shakkthivel and vasudevan 2006 yang et al 2017 apart from anionic polymeric antiscalants against metal ion based scale some cationic polymers have been used in inhibiting silica scale formation chen et al 2017 demadis and neofotistou 2007 demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 neofotistou and demadis 2004a neofotistou and demadis 2004b zhang et al 2011 anionic antiscalants have no effect on silica scale formation due to the special properties of silica scale that differ from those of metal ion based scale neofotistou and demadis 2004b by contrast some cationic polymers are effective at preventing silica scale formation ketsetzi et al 2008 neofotistou and demadis 2004a neofotistou and demadis 2004b several studies have reported the inhibition effects of some cationic polymers such as polyaminoamide pamam dendrimers with nh2 termini neofotistou and demadis 2004a neofotistou and demadis 2004b adipic acid amine terminated polyether d230 diethylenetriamine copolymer zhang et al 2011 synthesized cationic inulin catin ketsetzi et al 2008 polyethyleneimine pei polyallylamine hydrochloride palam and poly acrylamide co diallyldimethylammonium chloride pamalam demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 on silica scale these studies have shown that inhibition performance is related to polymeric structure and cationic charge density demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 ketsetzi et al 2008 positively charged polymers can associate with negatively charged silica monomers or soluble silica oligomers and thus interfere with the silica polymerization process and prevent the formation of colloid silica particles zhang et al 2011 different cationic polymeric antiscalants such as pamam pei palam and pamalam with various cationic groups i e weak cationic groups primary and secondary amines nh3 and rnh2 and strong cationic groups quaternary ammonium nr3 typically exhibit different inhibition performance demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 ketsetzi et al 2008 neofotistou and demadis 2004b although all of them can interact with negatively charged silica through electrostatic effects strong cationic polymers that contained quaternary ammonium salt groups palam and pamamlam demonstrated relatively poor performance against silica compared with pei which contains amine groups accordingly strong cationic groups may lead to decreased inhibition performance which may be due to the distinct interactions with silica from different cationic groups causing various effects demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 besides cationic polymers with strong cationic groups are typically ready to aggregate silica colloids through their evident coagulation effects apart from their antiscaling effect dao et al 2016 yang et al 2016 however the specific relationship between silica and antiscalants with different molecular structures is not yet well understood thus further research on the interactions between antiscalants and silica based scaling is required to gain an in depth understanding of the inhibition mechanisms for silica based scale and to develop effective antiscalants against silica based scaling in addition to ionic antiscalants water soluble nonionic polymers such as polyacrylamide lee et al 2015 wang et al 2006 yu et al 2006 and poly vinyl alcohol lakshminarayanan et al 2003 also have evident effects on caco3 crystallization crystal morphologies can be influenced by the interference of polymers that results from the crystal distortion effect lakshminarayanan et al 2003 lee et al 2015 wang et al 2006 yu et al 2006 apart from the electric nature of functional groups the content of functional groups on polymeric antiscalants plays an important role in their scale inhibition performance chen et al 2015a a high content of ionic groups typically results in high inhibition performance wang et al 2017b yu et al 2019 however a suitable content of ionic groups is sometimes required and a high charge density is occasionally detrimental to inhibition behavior because it may enhance other effects such as the flocculation effect wang et al 2017b yu et al 2018 chen et al 2015a used serine and polysuccinimide to prepare modified poly aspartic acid ser pasp and found ser pasp obtained at a molar ratio of 0 8 exhibited better inhibition performance against caco3 than those of ser pasp at high or low molar ratio and poly aspartic acid pasp which may be attributed to the synergistic effect induced at suitable contents and ratio of the introduced hydroxyl and carboxylic groups moreover polymer based materials exhibit the structural characteristics of multiplicity which considerably differs from those of small molecular materials elias 1984 flory 1953 apart from different contents and types of chemical compositions on the local chains mentioned earlier the structural morphology molecular size and conformation of polymers due to their distinct long chain structural features are particularly important determinants of final performance including the inhibition performance of polymeric antiscalants for example mw which is the most basic and important structural parameter of polymers and indicates macromolecular size exerts considerable influence on scale inhibition performance darton 2000 matin et al 2019 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2017b a relatively low mw is generally favorable for suppressing crystallization and a relatively high mw is required to act as dispersants darton 2000 matin et al 2019 polyacrylic acid paa which is the most common synthetic polymeric antiscalant with different mws has been found to exhibit varying inhibition behavior such as acting as a threshold agent within an mw range of 1000 3000 da exhibiting lattice distortion effect at an mw of 5000 10 000 da and working as a dispersion agent at an mw of 20 000 40 000 da darton 2000 however polymeric antiscalants with excessively high mw or under overdose typically result in poor inhibition performance which may be attributed to their bridging flocculation effects ali et al 2015 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2017b yu et al 2018 for polymeric antiscalants with multiple types of functional groups particularly for copolymers their distributions on the polymeric backbone i e the sequence structure are evidently influential in scale inhibition in addition to the contents and types of functional groups wang et al 2016b yu et al 2018 thus the molecular structure of polymeric antiscalants should be focused on and considered a key factor for improving the design of novel effective antiscalants in contrast with the hydrolysis of phosphorus based inhibitors these synthetic polymers are more resistant to high operating temperatures hasson et al 2011 this also means that they are nonbiodegradable which may have a profound environmental influence after their disposal hasson et al 2011 matin et al 2019 3 3 environment friendly antiscalants considering environmental impact the development of scale inhibitors has moved toward environment friendly antiscalants that are phosphorus free biodegradable and cost effective chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 at present the most promising alternatives to conventional phosphorus or nonbiodegradable synthetic polymeric inhibitors are pasp polyepoxysuccinic acid pesa and their derivatives chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 their structures are presented in fig 9 pasp and pesa have good chelating ability and dispersibility making them as general purpose antiscalants which have been applied in various fields such as industrial circulating water boiler water oil field water and ro desalination systems chaussemier et al 2015 chen et al 2015a hasson et al 2011 liu et al 2012a xu et al 2012 zhang et al 2016c to improve the comprehensive inhibition performance and application range of pasp and pesa considerable research has focused on introducing new functional groups onto them through various chemical modification processes chaussemier et al 2015 chen et al 2015a gao et al 2015 pramanik et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c 2017 apart from pasp and pesa some natural polymers that contain abundant functional groups with good chelating and dispersion effects such as starch cellulose lignin inulin tannin and collagen are also considered sources of potential environment friendly antiscalants due to their advantages of abundant source low cost and biodegradability boels and witkamp 2011 chauhan et al 2012 chaussemier et al 2015 guo et al 2013 hasson et al 2011 qiang et al 2013 wang et al 2017b yu et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2016a the applications of these natural polymers and their derivatives to scale inhibition have been reported and studies have indicated that suitable chemical modifications can considerably improve their inhibition performance boels and witkamp 2011 chauhan et al 2012 goncharuk et al 2012 guo et al 2013 hasson et al 2011 qiang et al 2013 wang et al 2017b yu et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2013 fig 10 presents the structures of several modified natural polymers that can be used as inhibitors some oms secreted by bacteria are also considered potential environment friendly bio antiscalants because they contain large amounts of effective functional groups li et al 2019 soluble extracellular polymeric substances s eps mostly including proteins polysaccharides and humic like substances extracted from bacillus cereus b cereus were evaluated as dual bio functional corrosion and scale inhibiting agents li et al 2019 they demonstrated good anti scale and anti corrosion performance through their chelating adsorption and biomineralization abilities with the advantages of biodegradability strong biosorption affinity and multiple fixation sites b cereus s eps may offer a green sustainable and economic strategy for developing environment friendly antiscalants however these biomaterials are also considered biofouling reducing membrane flux because of their easy adsorption onto membrane surface matin et al 2011 thus bio antiscalants can be effectively utilized in non membrane systems such as circulating cooling water but should be carefully controlled in membrane systems similar to synthetic polymeric antiscalants the molecular structures of environment friendly antiscalants not only the contents and types of functional groups but also the distributions of these functional groups long chain morphologies and mw which are associated with their specific interactions with various scale forming substances should be focused on and studied in depth to understand their inhibition mechanisms and to design and fabricate novel high performance and environment friendly antiscalants 4 evaluation of inhibition performance 4 1 operation methods proper and accurate evaluation of inhibition performance can provide useful guidance such as the selection of antiscalants and their approximate doses for the effective utilization of antiscalants in practical applications the detailed operation methods for the evaluation of scale inhibition performance can be divided into two major categories static and dynamic methods static methods include static jar test gb t 16632 2008 yang et al 2017 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 bubble method hg t 2024 2009 turbidity method abdel aal et al 2015 rabizadeh et al 2017 conductivity method goh et al 2018 and constant composition precipitation method lakshtanov et al 2011 the most common static method is the static jar test due to easy operation the apparent inhibition efficiency can be estimated directly by the change of solute concentration besides the changes in scale crystal morphology and the degrees of crystal distortion determined by electron microscopy and x ray diffraction can verify the effects of antiscalants also kim et al 2005 lee et al 2015 liu et al 2012b however its limitation is that different situations and conditions exist between the static jar test and practical applications making the obtained results not fully applicable to and inconsistent with many practical conditions boerlage et al 2002 hasson et al 1996 2001 considerable difference from practical application conditions also exists in other static methods the evaluation results from these methods may be unsuitable for practical applications but they can be used as pre evaluation approaches hasson et al 2001 dynamic methods can provide credible results for the practical applicability of antiscalants by simulating the conditions for practical applications al roomi and hussain 2015 2016 al roomi et al 2015 with regard to evaluating scale inhibition performance in dynamic ro systems a laboratory scale ro unit is typically used to simulate an actual ro process the scale inhibition performance can be determined by comparing the changes in permeate flux with and without antiscalant addition besides direct visual membrane surface monitoring by using an electron microscopy is also a useful method to evaluate scale surface coverage and surface number density that can reflect the effectiveness of antiscalants in ro processes bartman et al 2011 hasson et al 2001 lyster et al 2010 rahardianto et al 2008 shih et al 2005 shmulevsky et al 2017 thompson et al 2017 uchymiak et al 2008 compared with those of static methods the operational conditions of ro simulation tests can be closer to those of actual ro systems by adjusting operational parameters including pressure crossflow velocity and feed spacer the evaluation results from dynamic ro simulation tests are certainly more instructive 4 2 influencing factors many environmental factors can affect the properties of feed water and antiscalants scale formation and ro operation and thus influence the final inhibition efficiency al amoudi 2010 antony et al 2011 karabelas et al 2020 milne et al 2014 the effects of several popular external factors such as dose ph temperature and different coexisting substances on the scale formation and inhibition performance of antiscalants are discussed as follows 4 2 1 dose dose exerts considerable effect on inhibition performance on the one hand an inadequate dose of antiscalants may be insufficient to interact with scale forming substances and cause weak inhibition efficiency le gouellec and elimelech 2002b on the other hand an overdose of antiscalants may cause detrimental effects favoring scale formation by enhancing other effects such as bridging flocculation effect or the intermolecular interaction of antiscalants in addition to the antiscaling effect wang et al 2016b wang et al 2017b yang et al 2010b yang et al 2010c wang et al 2016b investigated the influence of the concentration of alkyl ethoxy carboxylates c12h25o ch2ch2o nch2coona on the inhibition efficiency against caco3 scale the results indicated that inhibition efficiency decreased slightly with the further increase of dose after maximum efficiency was reached which may be due to the reduced adsorption of antiscalants on caco3 crystals caused by the enhanced interaction of hydrophobic chain chain with an increase in ethylene oxide content in water when overdosing wang et al 2016b a similar phenomenon was observed in a polymeric antiscalant namely carboxymethyl starch cms against caco3 which was ascribed to the flocculation effect of the polymeric inhibitor and enhanced intermolecular hydrogen bonding at excessive cms dose wang et al 2017b when inhibiting silica scaling overdosed antiscalants also cause a detrimental effect demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 ketsetzi et al 2008 ketsetzi et al 2008 used catin to inhibit silica scale in which inhibitor dose over the optimal dose may reduce inhibition activity this result may be due to the aggregation and flocculation effects of the polycationic inhibitor on the negatively charged colloidal silica particles demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 observed the formation of fluffy precipitates when the dose of pei or palam was higher than the optimal dose and correspondingly decreased inhibition performance these cationic polymers are associated with negatively charged colloidal silica particles and thus insoluble silica polymer composites are formed demadis and stathoulopoulou 2006 moreover excessive antiscalants in ro systems may be readily adsorbed onto the membrane surface and increase membrane fouling caused by themselves ang et al 2016 gryta 2012 qin et al 2005 yu et al 2019 qin et al 2005 reported that relative fluxes decreased with the increase of dosing flocon 260 a polycarboxylic acid type antiscalant due to the additional organic fouling of this antiscalant a similar phenomenon was observed in the study of yu et al 2019 on the inhibition performance of carboxymethyl cellulose cmc against caso4 the normalized flux slightly decreased after reaching the optimal dose of 2 0 mg l which may be due to the increased adsorption of cmc onto the membrane surface as additional organic foulants yu et al 2019 in summary considering inhibition performance and economic issues optimal dose should be obtained and controlled carefully in accordance with the actual situation 4 2 2 ph solution ph is an important environmental factor that affects inhibition performance because solution ph can change the solubility of many types of mineral scaling and the charge properties of most ionic antiscalants in water prihasto et al 2009 qin et al 2005 tong et al 2019 for example the solubility of common carbonate minerals strongly depends on ph as ph decreases carbonate ions transform into bicarbonate ions and the solubility of bicarbonate minerals increases accordingly prihasto et al 2009 tong et al 2019 qin et al 2005 explored the effect of ph on the scaling control of ro processes for raw feed from a local nickel plating company which contained a high concentration of iron with a high risk of iron scaling they found that a low feed ph resulted in a low fouling tendency of ro membrane which can be attributed to the scaling elimination of iron at low ph by contrast the solubility of amorphous sio2 is relatively constant at near neutral or acidic ph but increases evidently above ph 8 9 milne et al 2014 tong et al 2019 bush et al 2018 investigated the application of ph adjustment pretreatment to prevent silica scaling in the membrane distillation process and the results showed that alkalization and acidification are effective pretreatment strategies for preventing silica scaling if ph can be adjusted higher than 10 or lower than 5 the increasing solubility under alkaline condition is due to the formation of ionic species h3sio4 and h2sio4 2 and the silica polymerization rate under acidic condition is lower compared with neutral and slightly alkaline solutions reducing the formation of insoluble silica bush et al 2018 milne et al 2014 tong et al 2019 antiscalants with ionic functional groups can convert from protonation to deprotonation when ph gradually increases and the interactions between antiscalants and scale forming substances accordingly change influencing inhibition performance ang et al 2016 ruiz agudo et al 2016 yang et al 2010b yang et al 2010c rahardianto et al 2008 compared the effect of initial ph ph0 6 4 and ph0 7 9 considering most feed water is under near neutral conditions on antiscalant effectiveness in ro desalting with high gypsum scaling propensity but no significant variations were found it was because the selected antiscalant permatreat pc 504 has been already at its fully ionized state at ph above 6 0 rahardianto et al 2008 ruiz agudo et al 2016 reported that the binding capacity of a commercial copolymer antiscalant maleic acid allyl sulfonic acid copolymer with phosphonate groups to complex ba2 ion increased with increasing ph this result was probably due to increased deprotonation of the acidic functional groups of the additive at ph 10 relative to ph 6 yang et al 2010b investigated the ph effect of feed water with ca2 ions on bovine serum albumin bsa fouling by using pasp fouling was mitigated at ph 7 0 compared with that at ph 4 9 the isoelectric point of bsa in the absence and presence of pasp due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion between bsa and bsa adsorbed ro membrane at ph 7 0 that led to less accumulation of bsa on the membrane surface in the presence of pasp bsa ca complexes will be uneasily aggregated and accumulated on the membrane surface but stabilized by pasp in water via the possible formation of water soluble bsa ca pasp complexes at high ph yang et al 2010b 4 2 3 temperature temperature exhibits evident changes with the seasons which can also affect scale formation by influencing crystal scale growth mineral solubility mass transfer in ro system biofouling and the interactions between antiscalants and foulants eventually affecting the utilization of antiscalants abdul azis et al 2001 agashichev 2005 jawor and hoek 2009 shakkthivel et al 2004 yang et al 2010a thus temperature effects should be considered in practical situations from eq 1 increasing temperature will increase the nucleation rate when the supersaturation ratio s is kept constant boerlage et al 2002 however solubility can also be influenced by temperature change affecting the supersaturation ratio bott 1997 the nucleation rate is critically dependent on the combined effects of the changes in temperature and s boerlage et al 2002 for common inorganic scales e g caco3 and caso4 the nucleation rate is typically improved with an increase in temperature accelerating scale formation her et al 2000 jawor and hoek 2009 matin et al 2019 shakkthivel et al 2004 due to the minimal effects of temperature on its solubility and supersaturation ratio zhang 2011 shakkthivel et al 2004 conducted and compared scale inhibition tests of acrylonitrile acrylic acid an aa and acrylonitrile methacrylic acid copolymers against caso4 and caco3 scales over a temperature range of 50 c 80 c with an increase in temperature the inhibition efficiency of the two copolymers decreased due to the high scaling tendency at elevated temperatures especially for an aa it acted partially as a coagulant at high temperatures to form precipitates with calcium ions and demonstrated worsened inhibition performance shakkthivel et al 2004 although the nucleation and crystal growth rates typically increase in ro systems water and solute permeability and mass transfer are usually enhanced as temperature increases which can simultaneously reduce energy consumption solute rejection and cp agashichev 2005 found cp resistance decreased and transmembrane flux increased with an increase in temperature using a proposed model jawor and hoek 2009 studied the effects of feed water temperature on flux rejection and inorganic fouling by gypsum scale formation for simulated brackish water the aforementioned opposite effects of a high temperature operation can enable high water recovery and low energy consumption but are accompanied by increased scaling risk jawor and hoek 2009 temperature also plays a significant role in microbial actions and biofouling a relatively high temperature is typically beneficial for bacterial growth and biofouling formation sánchez 2018 yang et al 2010a abdul azis et al 2001 found a high density of biofouling organisms in an intake bay during a summer experiment such high density was presumed to occur due to water quality changes in the bay seasonally and interannually in addition to biofouling itself inorganic scaling can also be affected directly or indirectly by microbial action due to temperature change abdul azis et al 2001 yang et al 2010a yang et al 2010a investigated the seasonal characteristic of seawater ro membrane fouling and showed that biofouling and inorganic fouling were serious in summer the cell multiplication was much more abundant and extracellular polymeric substances eps feature intensity was stronger in summer moreover abundant eps during summer were believed to be the reason for the evident increase in the precipitation of silica and calcium due to the strong capabilities of eps to adsorb these coexisting ions yang et al 2010a thus all the aforementioned effects of temperature must be considered and the use of antiscalants must be adjusted appropriately 4 2 4 coexisting substance in practice various pollutants coexist in treated water the scaling propensity of sparingly soluble salts may be influenced by the existence of other pollutants such as oms and inorganic ions which further affect the utilization of antiscalants matin et al 2019 oms are ubiquitous in all natural water sources with proteins polysaccharides and humics as the three major types of widespread organic foulants wang et al 2016a bsa sodium alginate sa and humic acid ha are generally used as model organic foulants to investigate the effects of oms on scaling as representative of proteins polysaccharides and humics respectively benecke et al 2018 wang et al 2016a wang et al 2016a found that the three pregenerated organic fouling layers bsa ha and sa all reduced the membrane flux compared with virgin membrane in a gypsum dominant nf process ha and sa still acted as nuclei for crystallization leading to higher surface crystallization of gypsum scaling and more serious flux decline than bsa fouled membrane wang et al 2016a benecke et al 2018 reported similar results that scaling from gypsum surface crystallization was enhanced in the presence of sa and ha however the antiscaling effects of various oms in membrane processes were also observed karabelas et al 2017 le gouellec and elimelech 2002a lee et al 2009 several studies have reported that the presence of ha slowed down ro nf membrane flux decline caused by mineral scaling most likely via the complexation effect and adsorption on active sites of the crystal surface le gouellec and elimelech 2002a lee et al 2009 karabelas et al 2017 investigated the effects of sa during the early stage of membrane scaling and its inhibition effect was proven in terms of the reduced deposit density on membranes crystallization rate and crystal shape modification sa was supposed to inhibit the crystallization process likely due to calcium binding with carboxylates of sa karabelas et al 2017 the concentrations of oms in these studies with positive effects on scale inhibition karabelas et al 2017 le gouellec and elimelech 2002a lee et al 2009 were below or equal to 10 0 mg l and those in the aforementioned opposite reports benecke et al 2018 wang et al 2016a 100 0 mg l or 3 0 12 0 mg carbon l were higher than 10 0 mg l this condition may partly explain the difference in the apparent contradictory effects of oms on mineral scaling moreover different feed water characteristics and molecular structural features of oms e g mw also play important roles in the effects of coexisting oms on mineral scaling in ro systems karabelas et al 2020 nielsen et al 2012 identifying the complex interactions involved is crucial for improving the understanding of scaling control in ro operation systems the effects of existing multiple inorganic ions should also be considered given that the existence of these ions may influence scale formation or the inhibition effect of antiscalants rahardianto et al 2008 waly et al 2012 wang et al 2017a rahardianto et al 2008 suggested that gypsum crystal growth in the presence of bicarbonate and the formation of caco3 scale in the gypsum dominant membrane system were retarded they also reported that bicarbonate and antiscalants may synergistically inhibit gypsum scale formation in a ro test due to their adsorption onto gypsum crystals however although caco3 crystallization was apparently suppressed in the presence of gypsum caco3 crystals may nucleate and grow at a slow rate and become observable after a longer period than allowed in the authors study rahardianto et al 2008 yu et al 2019 found flux decline was slightly reduced after the addition of either co3 2 or po4 3 in a gypsum dominant ro process without cmc as antiscalant this result is consistent with rahardianto et al 2008 s report in the presence of cmc the addition of coexisting ions presented nearly no influence on membrane fluxes compared with that without the addition of coexisting ions due to the strong inhibition effect of cmc yu et al 2019 existing studies have shown that coexisting inorganic anions may exert minimal effects on the inhibition performance of antiscalants but do influence the scaling process rahardianto et al 2008 waly et al 2012 yu et al 2019 in addition to inorganic anions metallic ion impurities notably zinc ion can also influence scale precipitation which can hinder caco3 precipitation and change crystal morphology aziz and kasongo 2019 bystrianský et al 2016 ghizellaoui and euvrard 2008 lisitsin et al 2005 aziz and kasongo 2019 compared the inhibition performance of a commercial antiscalant vitec 3000 containing phosphonic acid h2o3p and zinc ions the fluxes after a period of nearly 5 months were 32 78 l m2 h and 30 80 l m2 h for commercial and zinc ion antiscalants which were higher than the untreated flux i e 25 56 l m2 h lisitsin et al 2005 reported a zinc ion concentration of 2 0 mg l was able to achieve an evident suppression effect on the bulk precipitation of caco3 and on membrane scaling waly et al 2012 found that in addition to zinc ions magnesium ions significantly increased the induction time of caco3 crystallization which may be due to the effects of magnesium ions on nucleation and crystal growth through complexation and growth site blocking in contrast with the inhibition effects of zinc ions and magnesium ions mentioned earlier bystrianský et al 2016 reported the presence of iron ions accelerated crystallization of calcium sulfate and led to steeper flux decline in static jar tests and ro tests because of the formation of a solid scalant layer with iron oxides metal ions with high scaling potential such as iron ions should be noted because they will evidently contribute to aggravated membrane fouling in summary the effects of various coexisting substances on scaling have no unified law to follow based on these fragmentary reports the presence of different impurities may have varying influences on scale formation by accelerating or inhibiting crystallization processes which highly depends on the specific characteristics of different systems due to complicated physicochemical interactions involved among dominant scale forming substances antiscalants membranes and coexisting substances in solutions karabelas et al 2020 nielsen et al 2012 in addition these interactions are strongly influenced by the environmental factors mentioned earlier affecting the inhibition performance of antiscalants and the scaling behaviors in actual operations furthermore comprehensive research on the influence of different environmental factors should be conducted to optimize the operation conditions and understand the inhibition mechanisms for guiding the utilization of antiscalants in practical applications 5 applications of antiscalants in ro desalination systems various antiscalants have been developed and applied in water treatment industries such as boiler water cooling water thermal desalination and membrane industries to mitigate scaling chaussemier et al 2015 darton 2000 hasson et al 2011 liu et al 2019 nowack 2003 specific knowledge regarding the performance of different antiscalants in ro processes is beneficial for understanding their mechanisms and optimizing their applications however most of reports and literatures related to those commercial antiscalants were mainly focused on their application performance not antiscalants themselves and their detailed information including the composition purity and concentrations are not provided by manufacturers due to the commercial values making it difficult to thoroughly clarify the role of those commercial antiscalants here the reported performance of various antiscalants applied to different ro processes is primarily summarized in table 3 and elucidated as follows 5 1 phosphorus antiscalants the fact that phosphates can prevent the precipitation of metal ion based minerals by forming a soluble complex with metal ions or and distortion of crystal lattice has been discovered for more than 180 years rashchi and finch 2000 phosphorus antiscalants including phosphates and phosphonates can inhibit scale formation under low concentrations and have been widely applied in various fields nowack 2003 rashchi and finch 2000 they are the most popular antiscalants due to their high effectiveness and are the major commercial antiscalants applied to ro systems al rammah 2000 bonné et al 2000 rahardianto et al 2006 semiat et al 2003 shih et al 2005 shmp is a commonly applied phosphate due to its complexation ability and low cost butt et al 1997 hasson et al 1998 rashchi and finch 2000 hasson et al 1998 conducted preliminary ro tests to compare the degree of scale suppression against caco3 scale provided by calgon shmp and flocon 100 acrylic polyelectrolyte 35 solution flux decline data indicated that 2 0 mg l of calgon can effectively prevent permeability decline for flocon 100 a dose of 3 3 mg l cannot completely suppress scale formation but a dose of 10 0 mg l is necessary for full scale suppression over a test period of approximately 9 h hasson et al 1998 however phosphates occasionally easily hydrolyze into orthophosphate ions which may lead to the formation of calcium phosphate and increase the potential of biofouling thus the use of phosphonates is more common to avoid the inactivity of phosphate based antiscalants because of their hydrolyzation al roomi and hussain 2015 andrews et al 2008 butt et al 1997 li et al 2017 nowack 2003 al rammah 2000 conducted evaluation trials of several acid free antiscalants with phosphonates to replace the combination of sulfuric acid and shmp in a brackish water ro plant the results showed that a phosphino carboxylate based antiscalant m chemical completely inhibited membrane scaling and provided superior performance to the combination of shmp and sulfuric acid due to its higher stability and superior dispersion of silt clay and metal oxides al rammah 2000 rahardianto et al 2006 used a commercial formulation vitec 2000 with a phosphino carboxylic acid polymer as the active ingredient and tested its inhibition performance against gypsum scale under different operation conditions and membrane types inhibition performance increased with an increase in antiscalant dose the membrane area covered by scale decreased and the flux decline caused by scaling was eliminated rahardianto et al 2006 in their other study shih et al 2005 similar conclusions were obtained that the amounts of crystals on the membrane surface decreased as antiscalant dose increased and the size and morphology of surface crystals were changed significantly yang et al 2010b tested the inhibition efficiency of an organophosphorus compound lb 0100 in the control of bsa fouling using a bench scale crossflow ro system the results indicated that bsa fouling can be considerably reduced by properly dosing antiscalants lb 0100 overdosing causes aggravated ro membrane fouling which may result from the reduced water solubility of the formed antiscalant complexes at high antiscalant concentration yang et al 2010b in comparison with previous ph control in scale prevention the application of phosphorus antiscalants evidently reduces and even eliminates the use of acid and alleviates the subsequent corrosion bonné et al 2000 bonné et al 2000 used a commercial organophosphonate antiscalant permatreat 191 in a ro pilot plant to reduce the demand for acid when a small amount of acid was used with an antiscalant dose of 1 4 mg l for the safe control of the desired langelier saturation index lsi due to feed water fluctuations recoveries up to 87 can be obtained without scaling and no membrane cleaning is necessary within a period of 1 year bonné et al 2000 however qin et al 2005 found that the addition of permatreat 191 even enhanced membrane fouling by using spent rinse water from a nickel plating operation after ph adjusted to 4 2 6 8 and another typical polycarboxylic acid type antiscalant flocon 260 did not exhibit an inhibition effect on membrane fouling also which may be due to the complex ingredients of this actual wastewater in addition some commercial antiscalants consist of several active ingredients for high inhibition performance due to the synergistic effect such as combining phosphorus antiscalants with synthetic polymeric antiscalants ang et al 2016 he et al 2009 pramanik et al 2017 semiat et al 2003 semiat et al 2003 assessed the effectiveness of four commercial antiscalants against silica scale on the basis of changes in permeability decline and membrane surface supersaturation level the four antiscalants were two different blends of phosphonates and polymers permatreat 510 and hypersperse si 300ul a multi polymer acumer 5000 and an anionic polyelectrolyte aquafeed ex 105 all four antiscalants increased the threshold limit of the scaling onset from a membrane surface supersaturation level of 1 7 1 9 in the absence of antiscalants to a level of 2 1 2 3 in the presence of antiscalants permatreat 510 exhibited the best inhibition performance among the four antiscalants due to certain synergistic and complementary effects of low molecular and macromolecular inhibitors semiat et al 2003 butt et al 1997 used a synthetic brine to evaluate the efficacy of three inhibitors namely shmp inhibitor a acrylic polymer and inhibitor b polyacrylate pa and phosphonate when treated with the inhibitors the scale forming constituents ca2 sr2 and total alkalinity in solution can remain unchanged for 91 h shmp 50 h inhibitor a and 168 h inhibitor b inhibitor b a composite antiscalant achieved the best inhibition performance because of the synergistic effect butt et al 1997 field and laboratory results obtained by drak et al 2000 indicated that all four tested antiscalants enabled to prevent scaling at a water recovery level below 88 and lsi levels exceeding 2 0 showing good inhibition performance however three composite antiscalants all consisting of phosphonate and paa still presented different inhibition effects indicating the importance of formulating different ingredients in composite antiscalants although various phosphorus antiscalants typically exhibit good inhibition performance in different fields the use of this type of antiscalants should be restricted to reduce phosphorus emissions and the risk of eutrophication of surface waters andrews et al 2008 boels and witkamp 2011 li et al 2017 5 2 synthetic polymeric antiscalants the release of phosphorus from phosphorus antiscalants will cause unfavorable environmental effects therefore the development of new phosphorus free antiscalants has elicited considerable attention andrews et al 2008 boels and witkamp 2011 li et al 2017 various synthetic polymeric antiscalants with different antiscaling functional groups have been prepared based on the homopolymerization or copolymerization of acrylic acid aa maleic acid ma and other functional monomers ghani and al deffeeri 2010 they can effectively prevent scale formation due to chelation dispersion and crystal lattice distortion and thus are used as important ingredients of commercial antiscalants ang et al 2016 ghani and al deffeeri 2010 he et al 2009 polycarboxylic acid is a major class of synthetic polymeric antiscalants including paa polymethacrylic acid polymaleic acid and their bi ter and multi copolymers that contain carboxylic groups al hamzah and fellows 2015 ketrane et al 2009 paa is the most common active ingredient in commercial synthetic polymer antiscalants al hamzah and fellows 2015 ketrane et al 2009 shmulevsky et al 2017 shmulevsky et al 2017 revealed that increased concentrations of a polycarboxylic acid based antiscalant prolonged the induction period obtained from permeate flux data in inhibition of calcium sulfate scaling on ro membranes and led to rough formed crystals due to the crystal distortion effect boerlage et al 2002 reported the application of two pa polymers with different mws in ro pilot plants scaling frequently occurred during the 6 months of operation with antiscalant a2 pa mw 1600 da whereas no scaling was detected during the following 6 months of operation with antiscalant b2 pa mw 3500 da the different inhibition performance of the two pas was partially due to their different mws in addition to changes in environmental conditions boerlage et al 2002 antiscalant b2 with a relatively high mw exhibited an enhanced dispersive property resulting in high performance this finding indicated the importance of the molecular structures of polymeric antiscalants such as mw in their scale inhibition as previously discussed boerlage et al 2002 copolymers with other functional groups apart from carboxylic groups have been developed and applied to improve the inhibition performance of synthetic polymeric antiscalants dietzsch et al 2013 shakkthivel and vasudevan 2006 wang et al 2009 tzotzi et al 2007 assessed the effectiveness of various commercial antiscalants in inhibiting calcium carbonate scale on ro and nf membranes most of these antiscalants exhibited considerable inhibition performance against calcium carbonate on membrane surface by changing the morphology of crystals and reducing the amount of deposits the goodrite k798 additives paa sulfonic acid sulfonated styrene demonstrated significantly better performance compared with k702 paa which may be due to the synergistic effect of various functional groups tzotzi et al 2007 in summary polycarboxylic acid antiscalants are important types of synthetic polymeric antiscalants because carboxylic acid groups play an important role in scale inhibition yang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c the introduction of multiple functional groups improves the inhibition performance of this type of antiscalants due to the synergistic inhibition effect however the structure activity relationship of polymeric antiscalants cannot be established clearly and the effects of various structural factors including mw the contents types and distributions of various scaling functional groups and the sequence structures particularly for multi copolymer inhibitors on inhibition performance are still not comprehensively understood insufficient knowledge about polymeric antiscalants in scaling control at the molecular levels largely limits their practical applications 5 3 environment friendly antiscalants synthetic polymeric antiscalants are not easily degradable which may cause a difficulty in the subsequent concentrate disposal and a negative environmental effect due to their emissions hasson et al 2011 thus environment friendly antiscalants have become a popular topic because of their phosphorus free biodegradable and nonharmful properties the inhibition efficiency of pasp pesa and their various derivatives as the most promising green antiscalants has received widespread attention and been reported in many studies chaussemier et al 2015 chen et al 2015a hasson et al 2011 liu et al 2012a pramanik et al 2017 yang et al 2010b yang et al 2010c reported the control of om fouling e g bsa fouling and ha fouling with feed water containing ca2 ions by pasp and several commercial compounds lb 0100 mentioned earlier for bsa fouling and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate na2 edta for ha fouling in ro systems om fouling could be reduced by using a suitable dose of pasp but overdosing had a detrimental effect the presence of ca2 improved the inhibition performance of pasp against om fouling which may be due to the formation of a stable water soluble complex om ca pasp through ca2 bridging yang et al 2010b yang et al 2010c compared with the two commercial compounds pasp exhibited better inhibition effect which might be due to its distinct chemical structures gwak and hong 2017 used an antiscalant blended draw solution with a mixture of nacl and poly aspartic acid sodium salt pasp na in forward osmosis experiments to examine the scaling control effect of the novel strategy gypsum fouling tests demonstrated that the addition of pasp na to the draw solution can effectively control membrane scaling due to the inhibition effect of reversely flowed antiscalant from the blended draw solution gwak and hong 2017 to further improve the inhibition performance of pasp various attempts are ongoing and one of the most common methods is to introduce functional groups via chemical modification chen et al 2015a gao et al 2015 pramanik et al 2017 zhang et al 2016c 2017 pramanik et al 2017 synthesized a pasp derivative pasp sea asp by introducing sulfonic acid and carboxylic acid to the side chain of pasp and tested its scale inhibition performance on the desalination of synthetic brackish water using a polyamide ro membrane the results showed that compared with a commercial phosphorus antiscalant pasp sea asp and pasp achieved higher improvement in water recovery pasp sea asp was more effective than pasp due to the enhanced chelation ability from the introduced sulfonic acid groups pramanik et al 2017 apart from pasp the scale inhibition efficiency of other green antiscalants derived from natural polymers chaussemier et al 2015 hasson et al 2011 such as oxidized starch guo et al 2013 cms wang et al 2017b starch graft polyacrylic acid st g paa yu et al 2018 cmc kavitskaya et al 2000 yu et al 2019 and cmi akin et al 2008 boels and witkamp 2011 has also been investigated the inhibition performance of these antiscalants has been evaluated using static jar tests and ro tests and the results are comparable with those of commercial antiscalants yu et al 2019 prepared a series of cmc with different degrees of substitution ds and investigated its role in mitigating gypsum scaling on ro membranes similar to reported results ang et al 2016 gryta 2012 yang et al 2010b yang et al 2010c an appropriate dose was necessary for cmc to achieve remarkable inhibition performance the optimal dose decreased with an increase in ds but remained nearly unchanged when ds was more than a certain value this result indicated that a suitable ds was important to achieve good inhibition efficiency and minimize the production cost of antiscalants yu et al 2019 moreover the inhibition performance of cmc was as good as those of paa and amino trimethylene phosphonic acid atmp implying that natural polymer derivatives have remarkable potential as efficient environment friendly antiscalants yu et al 2019 in summary the applications of antiscalants to membrane scaling control particularly field operation data are still limited and widespread use of scale inhibitors in ro systems awaits considerable laboratory and field operation experiences antiscalants especially environment friendly inhibitors applied to ro membrane processes exhibits the advantages of convenient operation low device cost minimal equipment damage and highly effective inhibition performance compared with the conventional pretreatment methods mentioned earlier darton 2000 li et al 2011 tong et al 2019 however additional knowledge about polymeric antiscalants in scaling control particularly at the molecular levels is urgently required for optimized applications in their practical operations 6 existing problems and perspectives various antiscalants their applications to ro membrane scaling control and their advantages and disadvantages have been reviewed and discussed in this paper although antiscalants play a significant role in preventing membrane scaling many challenges practical problems and weakness of existing antiscalants such as enhanced bacterial growth appropriate dosing control and final concentrate disposal exist in their applications greenlee et al 2009b greenlee et al 2010a greenlee et al 2010b 2011 joo and tansel 2015 malaeb and ayoub 2011 mccool et al 2012 2013 pérez gonzález et al 2012 subramani and jacangelo 2014 sweity et al 2013 2014 2015 turek et al 2017 vrouwenvelder et al 2000 to improve the effectiveness of antiscalants in ro membrane scaling control ongoing research can focus on the development of novel high performance and environment friendly antiscalants on the basis of an in depth study of the inhibition mechanisms and well established structure activity relationships obtained from a comprehensive understanding of the molecular structures of antiscalants and the involved interactions among antiscalants scale forming substances membranes and other coexisting matters in solutions karabelas et al 2020 liu et al 2019 matin et al 2019 6 1 existing problems with regard to the practical applications of antiscalants to ro membrane processes several problems that limit and influence the utilization of antiscalants such as enhanced bacterial growth appropriate dosing control and concentrate disposal should be emphasized greenlee et al 2009b greenlee et al 2010a greenlee et al 2010b 2011 joo and tansel 2015 malaeb and ayoub 2011 mccool et al 2012 2013 pérez gonzález et al 2012 subramani and jacangelo 2014 sweity et al 2013 2014 2015 turek et al 2017 vrouwenvelder et al 2000 6 1 1 enhanced biofouling antiscalants can effectively inhibit scale formation through the interactions between functional groups and scale forming substances however antiscalants may also alter the physical chemical surface properties of membranes via adsorption particularly at overdoses which will enhance membrane biofouling sweity et al 2013 2014 2015 in particular membrane surface charge roughness and hydrophobicity are important factors that influence membrane organic fouling and biofilm formation these properties of membrane surface can be affected by the adsorption of antiscalants promoting membrane organic fouling and attachment of bacterial cells onto the surface ang et al 2016 sweity et al 2013 2014 2015 common commercial phosphorus based antiscalants are also a nutritional source for bacterial growth sweity et al 2013 2015 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 sweity et al 2013 tested the contribution of two common antiscalants i e polyphosphonate and pa based ones to membrane biofouling in the ro desalination process and the effects of antiscalants on membrane surface properties and bacterial adhesion were studied the results indicated that the addition of both types of antiscalants increased biofilm formation rate on membrane surface but followed different mechanisms the pa based antiscalant may enhance initial cell attachment and deposition by altering the polyamide surface more hydrophobic promoting biofilm formation the polyphosphonate based antiscalant was considered as an additional source of phosphorous to enhance biofilm formation rate sweity et al 2013 accordingly bacterial growth can be enhanced not only by phosphorous based antiscalants but also by synthetic polymeric antiscalants ashfaq et al 2019 bonné et al 2000 vrouwenvelder et al 2000 vrouwenvelder et al 2000 tested the biofouling potential of 14 antiscalants with an easily assimilable organic carbon test and a biomass production potential test the used chemicals exerted different effects on promoting biological growth with the paa based antiscalant a achieving the greatest promoting growth potential antiscalant a 2 5 mg l caused a significant increase in the normalized pressure drop approximately 60 within 11 days vrouwenvelder et al 2000 bonné et al 2000 used a combination of acid and antiscalant flocon 100 to prevent the formation of caco3 and baso4 scales in a ro plant although the combination was successful for scale inhibition with acid and antiscalant dosing the frequency of membrane cleaning was once every 4 6 weeks flocon 100 may be related to frequent cleaning because it was beneficial for biological growth and biofouling as a nutrient bonné et al 2000 these widely used antiscalants mostly consist of organic compounds combined with the influence on membrane surface properties the problem of enhanced biofouling should be focused on and mitigated as mentioned earlier the use of phosphorus antiscalants should be reduced to avoid their effect on enhancing bacterial growth in addition to decreasing the risk of water eutrophication and algal bloom the development of novel environment friendly antiscalants with high purification and enhanced inhibition performance that require low doses is desirable for mitigating enhanced biofouling in addition the combination of antibacterial units with antiscalants can be optimized to control membrane biofouling and scaling 6 1 2 dosing control as mentioned earlier dose plays an important role in the inhibition performance of antiscalants and inappropriate dosing will not only lead to increased membrane fouling but will also reduce inhibition efficiency kelle zeiher et al 2003 in addition to various methods for identifying the incipient scaling as mentioned in section 2 1 2 karabelas et al 2020 van de lisdonk et al 2001 antiscalant monitoring is essential for the appropriate dosing of antiscalants also conventional monitoring methods include colorimetric spectrometric turbidimetric and potentiometric techniques and the use of fluorescent tracers andrews et al 2008 darton 2000 feng et al 2014 kelle zeiher et al 2003 wang et al 2014 yuchi et al 2007 in contrast with acid dosing or softening which can be easily monitored using ph or ion selective electrodes most of these monitoring methods are troublesome and require measurements using large scale instruments kelle zeiher et al 2003 yuchi et al 2007 summarized the conventional methods for monitoring the concentration of a widely used antiscalant pa including 1 monitoring a spectral change based on the interaction of pa with certain substances e g metal reagent complex metachromic or fluorochromic dye 2 monitoring the concentration of an inert tracer added in proportion to pa via potentiometry or spectrophotometry e g li k br i transition metal ion dye 3 monitoring the intensity of fluorescence emitted from a tag covalently bound to pa and 4 monitoring turbidity change on the interaction of pa with a cationic surfactant several of these methods are inapplicable to rapid on site and online evaluation fluorescent molecule monitoring based on combining a fluorescent molecule with antiscalants has been reported to allow the online monitoring of antiscalant concentration using simple online equipment kelle zeiher et al 2003 the results showed that the use of fluorescent technology made the automated monitoring and control of antiscalant dosing effective kelle zeiher et al 2003 although fluorescent molecule technology has been successfully applied to cooling water systems the compatibility of added fluorescent molecules with the membrane surface must be considered for a membrane system apart from combining fluorescent molecules with antiscalants the synthesis of fluorescent antiscalant through the copolymerization of a monomer with a fluorescent chromophore and other monomers or modifying polymers using fluorescent groups is another useful method for introducing fluorescence characteristics feng et al 2014 wang et al 2014 feng et al 2014 introduced carbazole groups into pasp to obtain fluorescent poly aspartic acid fpasp the results showed that the relationship between the concentration of fpasp and the fluorescence intensity was linear which provided the possibility of auto dosing with fpasp feng et al 2014 appropriate dosing control reduces the risk of underdosing and overdosing making the use of antiscalants in ro systems effective apart from fluorescent tracer technology antiscalant detection requires further research to explore more effective dosing control methods 6 1 3 concentrate disposal the generated concentrate from ro systems requires further reasonable treatment joo and tansel 2015 subramani and jacangelo 2014 and controlled precipitation is a promising approach greenlee et al 2010b nevertheless the presence of antiscalants in the concentrate may adversely affect concentrate disposal due to the anti precipitation effect of antiscalants greenlee et al 2010a greenlee et al 2010b 2011 mccool et al 2012 greenlee et al 2010a performed precipitation experiments using a synthetic ro concentrate to investigate the effects of antiscalant type antiscalant concentration and precipitation ph on caco3 precipitation and filtration processes the results indicated that adding antiscalants can change the shape of precipitate particles and decrease particle size increasing mf flux decline in the succeeding separation step the mass of precipitated particles was also reduced due to the presence of antiscalants during precipitation greenlee et al 2010a greenlee et al 2010b also tried several synthetic concentrates in the presence of different compositions such as mg2 and so4 2 in which antiscalant dosing increased magnesium and sulfate precipitation and decreased calcium precipitation the adsorption of antiscalants onto the formed caco3 crystals was speculated to inhibit crystal growth and allow increased magnesium and sulfate to be incorporated into the formed caco3 greenlee et al 2010b the same group applied the advanced oxidation process aop of ozonation and hydrogen peroxide to the degradation of phosphonate antiscalants to eliminate the detrimental effect of antiscalants in the concentrate precipitation process greenlee et al 2011 the results showed that aop removed the effects of antiscalants on the mass size and morphology of precipitation particles and improved mf performance in the succeeding separation stage in some cases greenlee et al 2011 xu et al 2019 used ozonation treatment to remove 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtca and the results showed that the antiprecipitation effect of the antiscalant was gradually reduced with increasing ozonation time boels et al 2012 investigated the adsorption and desorption of atmp onto granular ferric hydroxide gfh from ro membrane concentrate the results indicated that the presence of calcium increased the surface coverage of phosphonates and substantially increased the adsorption rate gfh is reusable after regeneration with sodium hydroxide solution indicating that it is a promising adsorbent for the removal and recovery of atmp from ro membrane concentrates boels et al 2012 antiscalants increase the difficulties of concentrate disposal hence an appropriate concentrate pretreatment that can remove or degrade antiscalants is favorable for improving the performance of the succeeding concentrate treatment antiscalants particularly biodegradable ones easily degrade under certain conditions such as using enzyme catalysis which may be notably advantageous to final concentrate disposal in summary the effects of antiscalants on concentrate disposal have not been fully studied and effective methods to mitigate their adverse effects are still rare in depth studies are necessary to improve the understanding of the role of antiscalants in concentrate disposal and the optimization of the entire ro system 6 2 perspectives 6 2 1 optimizing the application of antiscalants in ro process in spite of the effective scaling control of antiscalants in ro systems many problems are associated with the real applications of antiscalants as mentioned earlier considerable research effort has been devoted to the improvement and optimization of antiscalants applied to ro systems ashfaq et al 2019 feng et al 2014 sweity et al 2015 xu et al 2019 first suitable antiscalants should be selected in accordance with feed water characteristics such as ph and composition and the structural features of the selected membrane the optimization of ro operational conditions such as crossflow velocity applied pressure hydrodynamic conditions and target recovery setting is important in practical applications antony et al 2011 goh et al 2018 greenlee et al 2009a tong et al 2019 for the operation of antiscalants rapid adjustment of antiscalants dose in accordance with the results of membrane scaling monitoring and antiscalant dosing monitoring can avoid potential aggravated scaling due to available changes in feed water characteristics and environmental conditions thus monitoring methods for membrane scaling and antiscalant dosing control technologies are essential and should be further developed feng et al 2014 karabelas et al 2020 kelle zeiher et al 2003 van de lisdonk et al 2001 the combination of antiscalants with other ro related pretreatments also plays an important role in optimizing the utilization of antiscalants besides the inhibition performance of antiscalants can be further improved using modified membrane installation design and operation both of which can more efficiently remove scale forming substances from treated water and largely reduce the antiscalants doses however researches on exploring the synergistic effects of antiscalants with other pretreatments and different ro units on the improvement of the whole ro operation performance is notably necessary 6 2 2 environment friendliness of antiscalants apart from the aforementioned strategies in practical operations the development of novel high performance and environment friendly antiscalants should be the most critical point that requires additional attention to obtain high scaling control performance phosphorus antiscalants should be used less or completely discarded because of their evident harmfulness to the environment regardless of their good inhibition performance phosphorus free antiscalants particularly biodegradable ones have greater prospects in real applications due to their significant environment impact and their distinct antiscaling performance besides the difficulties of concentrate disposal may be solved by using easily biodegradable antiscalants instead of those synthetic antiscalants which would avoid that the presence of antiscalants can hamper complicate mining the elements in the brine in addition to pasp and pesa polysaccharides including starch cellulose chitosan and alginate are considered good candidates used as efficient antiscalants because of their significantly environment friendly features however studies on the development of novel polysaccharide based antiscalants and their applications to ro systems particularly field operation are lacking 6 2 3 fabrication of high performance antiscalants a high performance material must be designed and fabricated on the basis of the structure activity relationship and its application mechanisms ashby et al 2013 wessel 2004 suitable antiscalants with desired molecular structures can be accordingly obtained by using various chemical methods chen et al 2015b edgar et al 2001 heinze and liebert 2001 kang et al 2015 roy et al 2009 however previous studies related to inhibition mechanisms were mostly superficial and focused on qualitative description by contrast quantitative analyses are rare wang et al 2017b yu et al 2018 2019 this condition may be attributed to two facts the first is the lack of an in depth understanding of antiscalants molecular structures particularly polymeric antiscalants causing difficulty in studying the inhibition performance of antiscalants at the molecular levels and establishing the structure activity relationship for example the sequence structures of copolymers with more than two comonomers are difficult to determine using currently available structural characterization methods kang et al 2015 roy et al 2009 hence precise characterization awaits the development of advanced technologies and sophisticated analytical instruments the other fact is the lack of understanding of the complicated physicochemical interactions involved among dominant scale forming substances antiscalants membranes and other coexisting substances in solutions karabelas et al 2020 matin et al 2019 in previous studies researchers derived various inhibition mechanisms including chelation dispersion and crystal distortion qualitatively based on apparent inhibition behavior and available interactions in fact quantitative or semiquantitative details such as the degrees of their various interactions and the delayed and or inhibited kinetic processes of inorganic scale crystallization should be studied in depth at the molecular levels to guide the development of effective antiscalants in addition to the effects of antiscalants on the scaling ions and or formed scales when they are applied to ro systems the effects of antiscalants on the membrane should not be disregarded possible interfacial interactions between antiscalants and membrane surface such as electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding hydrophobic interaction and π π electron donor acceptor interactions can alter membrane surface properties influence membrane separation performance and even cause membrane fouling the design and preparation of antiscalants with enhanced inhibition effects but weakened fouling on the basis of the detailed evaluation of their available involved multiple interactions are interesting topics this knowledge can be obtained from the comprehensive analysis of the molecular structural characteristics of scaling ions formed scales membranes and antiscalants however it is a quite complicated process to acquire a high performance practical antiscalant from laboratory to market which still require close cooperation between relevant scientists and engineers 7 conclusion in summary 1 antiscalants particularly environment friendly ones have a wide application prospect in ro membrane scaling control due to their notable advantages as mentioned earlier 2 the novel and high performance antiscalants can be designed and fabricated on the basis of the well established structure activity and 3 remarkable achievements will be obtained through efforts in the optimization of practical applications of antiscalants also such achievements can favor the extensive applications of antiscalants to membrane scaling control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
17729,water has been pushed into a linear model which is increasingly acknowledged of causing cumulative emissions of pollutants waste stocks and impacting on the irreversible deterioration of water and other resources moving towards a circular model in the water sector the configuration of future water infrastructure changes through the integration of grey and green infrastructure forming nature based solutions nbs as an integral component that connects human managed to nature managed water systems in this study a thorough appraisal of the latest literature is conducted providing an overview of the existing tools methodologies and indicators that have been used to assess nbs for water management as well as complete water systems considering the need of assessing both anthropogenic and natural elements furthermore facilitators and barriers with respect to existing policies and regulations on nbs and circularity have been identified the study concludes that the co benefits of nbs for water management are not adequately assessed a holistic methodology assessing complete water systems from a circularity perspective is still needed integrating existing tools i e hydro biogeochemical

being socio economic development as well as in sustainable ecosystem services unep 2009 water is itself the most valuable and universal resource and at the same time water contains nutrients and water is viewed as a carrier of energy thus water systems intersect with all sections of society industry and the natural environment iwa 2016 arup et al 2018 over the past years the increased stress on limited water resources has reached a critical level in terms of both reduced water availability and jeopardized water quality sgroi et al 2018 the ecosystems could not function without sufficient water supplies of appropriate quality making water scarcity a key stressor in many ecosystems voulvoulis 2018 on top global demand for water is expected to exceed viable resources by 40 by 2030 if we continue business as usual wintgens et al 2016 therefore the challenge is to meet or manage the competing demand for water to minimize the damage to the environment and to regenerate the natural ecosystems wwap 2018 water in nature represents one big cycle maintained by natural processes e g precipitation infiltration evapotranspiration condensation etc which is interrupted by urbanization and by man made water systems therefore water has been pushed into the linear model of take make consume and dispose which is economically unsustainable and causes a successive degradation of water quality as water travels through the system stuchtey 2015 in response to the linear pattern of growth the adoption of the circular economy ce model is proposed that decouples economic growth and development from the consumption of finite sources murray et al 2017 babbitt et al 2018 hofmann 2019 in order to deploy and enhance circularity a number of studies have focused on identifying priority areas of action hislop and hill 2011 ec 2015a emf 2017 emf and wef 2017 emf 2018 emf and arup 2019 water was identified as one of the key priority resources by hislop and hill 2011 the rest of the working groups mainly focus on the consumer goods sector mentioning the preservation of water but the importance of closing the water loops is not well addressed single indicators assessing the circularity of products either qualitative or quantitative have been developed in various academic studies the portfolio includes the circular economy toolkit cet evans and bocken 2013 the material circularity indicator mci emf and granta design 2015 the circular economy indicator prototype ceip griffiths and cayzer 2016 the longevity indicator franklin johnson et al 2016 and an economic value based circularity metric linder et al 2017 these indicators focus on the technical cycles while disregarding the biological cycles which are of major importance in the water sector they target at materials preservation with strategies such as recycling which is only one aspect of circularity and even misleading in the water sector water cannot be manufactured by recycled materials as water is a raw material itself thus preservation of materials can only be applied in the drinking water treatment plants dwtps and wastewater treatment plants wwtps in order to recover nutrients salts and metals that can be used in other interconnected systems such as agriculture and industry these strategies are good for preserving raw materials stocks but the preservation of water stocks is poorly addressed on the other hand pauliuk 2018 proposed a dashboard of new and established indicators based on material flow analysis mfa material flow cost accounting mfca and life cycle assessment lca to assess five main characteristics i e restore regenerate maintain utility maintain financial value and maintain nonfinancial value as well as four complementary characteristics i e resource efficiency climate energy and sufficiency in the water sector three reports have been published up to date i e stuchtey 2015 iwa 2016 arup et al 2018 conceptually describing what should be considered in order to create circular water systems they highlight the importance of establishing different water functionalities e g consumptive and non consumptive water water as a durable that would enable the balance between water withdrawals and return flows the consideration of water materials and energy pathways in order to create synergies within and outside the water sector the need for an integrated urban resource management is also highlighted looking at the water cycle from catchment to consumer and back to catchment following a systems approach that reveals interconnections between the human managed and nature managed systems at the core of circular water systems lies the realization of the three principles identified by arup et al 2018 i e design out waste externalities keep resources in use and regenerate natural capital however to the best of our knowledge this approach has not yet been applied into practice for developing an assessment methodology for circular water systems the transition to circular water systems requires the redesign of the water infrastructure the utilization of recent developments in technology and the integration of nature based ecosystems to the grey infrastructure i e hybrid infrastructure o hogain and mccarton 2018 existing concepts and approaches using and enhancing nature such as ecosystem based adaptation eba green infrastructure gi ecosystem services ess and nature based solutions nbs have gained momentum as they tackle challenges e g climate mitigation and adaptation water management degradation and loss of natural capital disaster risk reduction etc in a more sustainable way compared to the conventional hard engineering while all four concepts share the common principle of multifunctionality nbs can be considered as an umbrella to the other concepts with a strong solution oriented focus and biodiversity lying at its core pauleit et al 2017 up to date several definitions have been applied to describe nbs e g the definitions provided by ec 2015b cohen shacham et al 2016 raymond et al 2017 o hogain and mccarton 2018 langergraber et al 2019a according to them nbs should be cost effective resource efficient and locally adapted nbs are systemic interventions that bring more and more diverse nature and natural features and processes they address either a specific problem i e societal challenge or multiple challenges and simultaneously provide environmental social and economic benefits such as biodiversity climate change mitigation and adaptation resilience human well being etc while ce seeks to reduce environmental stress of socio economic activities nbs have the potential to enhance environmental and ecological status and to address human demand for natural resources nbs can restore the crucial natural processes by changing the fluxes of water sediment nutrients and pollutants that drive the water cycle and thus return the circularity to the water systems nbs are also capable of resources recovery from water like nutrients which fits in the natural water and nutrients cycles facilitating the transition from open to closed loops therefore the synergies fostered between the two concepts bring nbs to the forefront of enabling the realization of circular water systems this study is conducted in order to shed light on the assessment of circular water systems and the integration of nbs as enablers to water circularity by addressing two main questions what are the main parameters that should be considered in circular water systems i e section 2 and what methods could be deployed in order to holistically assess the circularity of water systems considering that nbs can be used as means to integrate nature to human managed systems a thorough investigation on the current state of nbs is carried out this is followed by a literature review on the assessment methodologies that have been applied to evaluate their performance including indicators that have been used developed as metrics of performance i e section 3 current regulations and policies that act as barriers or facilitators for implementing nbs are also reviewed i e section 4 the third part i e section 5 reviews existing tools methods and indicators for assessing the performance of water systems and elaborates on their suitability to evaluate key circularity aspects the last part i e section 6 concludes on what methods and indicators can be used and what is still missing in order to holistically assess the circularity of water systems 2 circularity in water systems what needs to be measured in view of the lack of a water circularity definition the white papers of stuchtey 2015 iwa 2016 and arup et al 2018 are considered in this study to understand what needs to be measured for assessing circularity in water systems the three principles of regenerate natural capital keep resources in use and design out waste externalities should be assessed following the water energy and materials nutrients pathways the three principles indicate the requirement of a systems approach as well as the consideration of the interactions between natural and human managed systems water related human managed systems encompass various socio economic sectors i e urban water sector agricultural food sector energy sector and industrial sector with agriculture and industries accounting for the highest global water withdrawals fao 2016 therefore water circularity needs to consider all water users and not being managed at a sectoral level to this extent water circularity can only be achieved in a multi sectoral system including both human managed and nature managed systems natural and anthropogenic water cycles should be closed and symbiotic management of resources be promoted avoiding burden shifting both from one sector to the other but also from the anthroposphere to the environment to achieve and assess water circularity the goals of the different ce principles are explained the goal of the regenerate natural capital principle is to ensure functional environmental flows and stocks by reducing the anthropogenic water uses preserving and enhancing ecosystems and ensuring minimum disruptions from human interactions and use in order to assess this principle selected assets of ecological integrity and of regulating provisioning and cultural ecosystem services are proposed to be considered ecological integrity targets at reducing water and nutrient loss and storage capacity of nutrients and water i e soil nutrient retention soil organic matter soil water storage regulating ecosystem services are targeted at climate regulation i e sources and sinks of ghgs groundwater recharge and nutrient regulation provisioning ecosystem services target at crops livestock and fodder while cultural ecosystem services focus on recreation and aesthetic values the goal of keep resources in use principle is actually to close the water and water related materials and energy loops within the system it can be achieved by optimizing resource yields optimizing energy and resource extraction and by maximizing recycling and reuse recirculation of resources to close the loops requires sufficient quantity of the reused resources and suitable quality to meet the internal demands which would result in a reduction of the amount of resources that are abstracted from the nature and the amount of returning flows the design out waste externalities principle focuses on both the reduction of waste and the economic efficiency of the system i e the costs of reducing waste by one unit is equal to the economic and environmental benefits of having one less unit of waste the reduction is achieved by taking actions to achieve the keep resources in use principle while the remaining waste i e gaseous liquid and solid has impacts on the environmental system affecting the regeneration of natural capital principle therefore the environmental impacts the avoided negative environmental impacts and the economic benefits and costs need to be considered in the assessment all three ce principles can be achieved by modifying current systems and grey infrastructure while classical grey infrastructure can be designed to enhance water reuse and resources recovery it differs significantly from the concept and paradigm of nbs nbs are using natural processes i e they work with nature while grey systems infrastructure use additional energy to achieve circularity introducing nbs to urban water management naturally enhances circularity of the urban water system hence shifts the urban water management into ce water in the ce should be placed without unnecessary additional energy use which for the modification of the existing grey water infrastructure would be inevitable in particular the implementation of nbs can lead not only to modifications but rather to new hybrid systems more sufficiently applying the three principles for example constructed wetlands treating road runoff will prevent pollution of water bodies recharge groundwater and increase biodiversity wetland roofs will collect and treat rainwater to be used for non potable domestic purposes while simultaneously acting as a natural air conditioning that is cost effective and resource efficient therefore nbs by exploiting their multifunctionality can facilitate the transition to circular water systems the implementation of a single nbs may simultaneously obtain multiple co benefits related to circularity and achieve the same result with traditional grey infrastructure where multiple mono functional engineering solutions are required additionally the fact that nbs interconnect nature managed to human managed systems leads to their consideration as a key element to identifying methods to holistically assess circularity of water systems any water circularity assessment can be undertaken at three different scales i e micro single components meso interconnected components forming a system and macro catchment city region or national assessment methodologies at any scale need to take into consideration the other scales of assessment as well in order to add significant value and become applicable therefore the interlinkages that the analyzed system has with other systems and scales needs to be considered as well by providing the information required for the assessment at higher scales fig 1 which illustrates how the information obtained from the assessment at a small scale provides feedback to the next assessment scale until the puzzle of water circularity of a basin is completed the puzzle diagram is followed in the present review of the currently available methodologies assessing nbs at different scales and water systems in order to identify the required information that would shed light on how to assess water circularity 3 nbs enabling circularity in water systems systematic literature review a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the current state of nbs to enhance circularity of water systems targeting at publications from scientific journals identified from the databases of scopus and science direct the key words that were selected i e nature based solution water water system circular economy circularity and assessment were used in multiple combinations as presented in fig 2 and the search conducted throughout the whole text was expanded to all article types among the identified papers 323 studies were categorized based on the main societal challenge to be tackled and their numerical proportions are illustrated in the pie diagram of fig 2 the connection of nbs to the concept of circularity especially in water systems is not well addressed by the researchers bar chart results additionally the pie diagram of fig 2 illustrates that only 7 and 3 of the research focuses on water security and water quality respectively the studies dealing with water security and water quality were analyzed to understand the extent to which they address water related issues the water related studies assessing different aspects of nbs performance are summarized based on their context in table 1 the study of castonguay et al 2018 is the only one identified dealing with social aspects this study focuses on the evaluation of different strategies for technology adoption to help decision making by simulating the interactions of regulatory bodies and households within an agent based model integrating economic and environmental factors their results indicate that using economic instruments alone may have been insufficient to promote the adoption of rainwater tanks and that water restrictions have had a major impact on the uptake additionally the study of reynaud et al 2017 used a contingent valuation approach to estimate the willingness to pay wtp of households to different multipurpose infrastructures conventional or green for managing flood and water pollution they concluded that there is an excessive willingness to pay for green infrastructure in comparison to conventional systems the wtp in this study was influenced by people s income and their visits from gorla maggiore water park the optimization of certain parameters of stormwater and wastewater treatment systems including nbs to improve their design has been performed in three studies andres domenech et al 2018 considered runoff characterization and volume and rainfall depth to improve the design of source control systems cáceres et al 2018 developed a statistical tool to select the most adequate withdrawal depth for optimizing the wastewater treatment processes moezzibadi et al 2019 evaluated the filtering performance related to suspended solids loads of constructed wetlands to improve their design the technical evaluation of the nbs has been performed in the studies of hernandes crespo et al 2017 geronimo et al 2019 haddis et al 2020 krzeminski et al 2019 jurczak et al 2018 masseroni et al 2018 and licciardello et al 2018 these studies consider water quality parameters and or water retention capacity as the main aspects of their evaluation including in some cases costs licciardello et al 2018 masseroni et al 2018 krzeminski et al 2019 and biodiversity hernández crespo et al 2017 hernandes crespo et al 2017 however the scope of these studies is narrow focusing on the technical performance or the design optimization and they do not assess holistically the proposed solutions e g potential co benefits are excluded from the evaluation the studies of chow et al 2014 liquete et al 2016 boelee et al 2017 bricker et al 2017 garfí et al 2017 li et al 2017 radinja et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 were identified as more relevant for the purpose of this work they either deploy a more holistic assessment or consider aspects relevant to assess water circularity sub section 3 1 the studies considering economic aspects of nbs are analyzed in sub section 3 2 3 1 methodologies and indicators assessing nbs for water circularity the eight studies identified in the previous section are categorized based on the methods that they deploy for assessment i e water balance lca modeling and combination of different tools the indicators developed used in the reviewed studies are presented in table 2 and they are compared to the different water management aspects identified in eklipse framework table 2 developed by raymond et al 2017 the sufficiency of the different aspects considered in the studies to holistically assess nbs for water management and their potential contribution to circularity of water systems are investigated a water balance method is used in the study of bricker et al 2017 that presents a vision exercise to study the impacts of different interventions on groundwater balance at city level water balance can be used to assess the increase in infiltration and water storage which is one of the main considerations when assessing nbs for water management according to eklipse framework table 2 however this study does not apply a holistic assessment methodology as only one aspect i e groundwater storage is evaluated the study of bricker et al 2017 is the only one identified among the studies analyzed in this section that deploys a semi quantitative water balance approach to investigate how specific interventions impact water systems considering both anthropogenic and natural water flows the consideration of mass balances from a circularity perspective i e to close the water loops are of major importance and similar studies are reviewed in section 5 lca is used by garfí et al 2017 to assess the environmental impacts of a conventional infrastructure and two nbs technologies as alternatives for wastewater treatment in small communities the indicators used for the assessment are presented in table 2 one of the strongest advantages of lca is the fact that it is a standardized and well established method for the evaluation of the environmental impacts for the entire life cycle of a product process or service iso 1997 hertwich 2005 and it is widely used to compare the environmental sustainability of different water technologies e g pan et al 2011 manso et al 2018 guertin et al 2019 pan et al 2019 oquendo di cosola et al 2020 however when it comes to the assessment of nbs following the eklipse framework table 2 none of the highlighted considerations can be addressed using lca there are three main constraints firstly the high level of abstraction associated with the lca results leads to potential rather than actual impacts thus there is a generalization of the lca impacts that do not refer to specific cases pizzol et al 2015 bai et al 2018 nbs on the other hand should be locally adapted mandating environmental evaluations to be tailored to local environments secondly lca focuses more on the environmental costs e g biodiversity loss rather than the environmental gains e g carbon sequestration rugani et al 2019 thirdly the consideration of feedback loops between processes across the anthropogenic and the natural environment are generally neglected in lca weidema et al 2018 this means that the effects on ecosystems driven by changes occurred in the anthropogenic systems are not considered which further neglects the consideration of the effects of those changes back to the anthropogenic systems underestimating the actual load of the life cycle impacts therefore lca is very useful for comparing alternative solutions but not for assessing actual environmental impacts and the interconnections between natural and human managed systems modeling projected scenarios are deployed in the studies of boelee et al 2017 and zhang et al 2019 to assess the performance of nbs under future climatic conditions boelee et al 2017 developed a model to evaluate the performance of alternative scenarios to address simultaneously water management challenges i e water shortages pollution deterioration of aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity loss under future projections in terms of urbanization climate change and increasing demands for food production and hydropower zhang et al 2019 used a model to examine the implications of climate change on future rainfall and evaluate the reliability of water sensitive urban design wsud stormwater infrastructure in pollution reduction flow frequency mitigation and reliability as an alternative water supply both studies are able to address some of the key points identified in the eklipse framework table 2 under dynamic time and spatial variations of the system however scenario analysis modeling is more relevant for investigating options for the future rather than the actual state of the system therefore process understanding modeling is considered more appropriate for water circularity assessment and relevant studies are reviewed in section 5 more holistic approaches resulted from combination of different tools and methods were adopted in the studies of liquete et al 2016 chow et al 2014 li et al 2017a and radinja et al 2019 liquete et al 2016 deployed a runoff model water quality measurements biological samplings surveys satellite images arcgis and fragstat software to assess multiple environmental economic and social benefits of a set of cws surrounded by a park to treat the excess flow of mixed sewage and rainwater during heavy rain events chow et al 2014 developed a systemic multi criteria decision support framework to evaluate the design of grey green drainage infrastructure based on quantitative measures i e indicators covering energy environment water quantity and quality criteria and monetary costs and benefits li et al 2017 developed a benefit evaluation system for low impact development of urban stormwater management measures based on analytic hierarchy process and urban stormwater model including environmental i e water quantity and quality economic i e civil construction and maintenance costs and social i e rainwater reuse landscape value and ecological function benefits radinja et al 2019 used a framework based on hydrology hydraulic modeling and multi criteria analysis mca to evaluate co benefits i e combined sewer overflow reduction capex opex amenity biodiversity and ownership of sustainable drainage systems suds resulting in favorable scenarios for stormwater control measures although these studies consider several water management criteria for their evaluations see table 2 water quantity which is important to investigate the extent of closing the water loops and the enhancement of the natural water cycle is not well addressed although there is a variety of developed used indicators among the different studies they are not able to cover all the different aspects of water management i e the water management criteria identified in the eklipse framework as shown in table 2 most of the studies focus on the main societal challenge to be addressed by nbs i e water quality issues and flood risk underestimating the enhancement of the natural environment e g the natural water cycle is not considered and many co benefits e g carbon storage capacity is not evaluated by any of the reviewed studies another issue is the scale of assessment nbs are assessed as individual components i e detached from the complete water system neglecting the whole supply chain i e upstream and downstream processes and flows the systems thinking the interconnections between these processes and feedbacks and therefore the impacts to the natural and urban water system a fragmented approach of understanding isolated parts of the water system increases the risk of implementing solutions that may be inefficient due to overlooking many dynamic and aggregated effects that emerge at larger scales i e due to the complex interactions of the different components with their surroundings thorslund et al 2017 this may result in overestimation of the effectiveness of nbs if assessed at small scales but also insufficiency to assess circularity of water systems 3 2 methodologies and indicators economically assessing nbs while nbs appear to be capable of addressing water management challenges and enhancing ecosystem services the debate on how to valuate nature its attributes and services in monetary terms is still open as they are not goods directly traded in the markets bockarjova and botzen 2017 this section focuses on commonly used methods for economic evaluation of nbs i e life cycle cost analysis lcca cost benefit analysis cba cost effectiveness analysis cea and natural capital accounting lcca is an economic assessment that accounts for all the relevant costs throughout the entire life cycle of a product service or process enabling the comparison between different alternatives bhoye et al 2016 life cycle costing lcc considers investment implementation operation maintenance and end of life e g disposal and residual value costs benefits cash flows according to the directive 24 eu 2014 directive 2014 24 eu 2014 it can also include costs related to environmental externalities e g greenhouse gas emissions the results of lcca are expressed using an economic measure e g net present value npv benefit cost ratio bcr payback period pp and annual lcc economic assessment based on lcca has been performed by many researchers to evaluate the economic impacts e g of rainwater harvesting systems e g roebuck et al 2011 amos et al 2018a green roofs e g ziogou et al 2018 including the monetization of the avoided environmental deterioration waste management alternatives lee et al 2020 urban vegetation sicard et al 2018 one of the main limitations of lcca is that environmental and economic benefits that are not easy to be monetized e g reduction in urban flooding biodiversity increase increased property value due to aesthetic improvement etc tend to get lost potentially prejudicing the decisions amos et al 2018b ziogou et al 2018 the same limitation stands for cba as it calculates the total costs related to a project monetizes the obtained environmental and social benefits and compares the results to identify the most efficient alternative hansson 2007 however cba is considered as one of the most widely applied tools for economic analysis balanay and halog 2019 and it is used to economically evaluate nbs for example feng and hewage 2018 used cba to assess the payback period of green roofs in different markets considering life cycle costs public and individual benefits cba considering public and private costs and benefits was also deployed by reddy et al 2015 to assess water shortages risk of alternative scenarios including nbs cea is proposed by boerema et al 2018 as an alternative economic evaluation method for environmental management in order to overcome the limitation of cba of expressing benefits into explicit monetary terms therefore cea identifies the most cost effective strategy by comparing the investment costs to achieve a specific goal or measure of effectiveness expressed in any unit e g biodiversity conservation helm and hepburn 2012 greenhouse gas emission reduction macleod et al 2010 water provision improvement yang 2011 however in cea each measure of effectiveness is treated separately due to the different units thus their integration for assessing whether the total benefits exceed the total costs is not always possible natural capital accounting is defined by philips 2017 as a series of interconnected physical and monetary accounts that provide a structured set of information related to the stocks of natural capital and flows of services supplied by them monetary accounts are referred to annual monetization of selected services resulting in an overall valuation of the natural asset s ability to generate future flows of services for example vogl et al 2017 discussed the importance of watersheds natural capital valuation increase i e the cost of maintaining the natural capital in healthy watersheds that contributes to public good and private values of the uptake and impact of investments in watershed services although non market goods such as many ecosystem services do not have direct exchange values i e the supply value equals the use value natural capital accounting is based on the concept of exchange value thus the monetary valuation of non market goods is based on estimations as if a market existed philips 2017 therefore such estimated exchange values increase the uncertainty of this method table 3 presents indicators that have been used in literature while some established economic values e g npv bcr pp capex opex exist and are used in the studies most indicators are case specific even within the lcca method the lcc indicator is interpreted differently among the studies e g lee et al 2020 consider the revenue from products while ziogou et al 2018 consider the environmental cost of emissions especially for cba and cae the costs and benefits effectiveness measures strongly depend on the scope of each study and often the economic assessment is based on economic analysis e g economic and environmental or ecologic balance of the system rather than development of indicators 4 nbs for water implementation barriers and potential risks in recent years the concepts of circular economy and nbs have been promoted and encouraged at eu level ec 2015a ec 2015b however in some cases current policies and regulations designed for a linear economy paradigm are likely to hinder rather than encourage their implementation as evidenced in the study of stewart et al 2016 regulations can act as barriers that prevent the adoption of innovative sustainable approaches e g giving unclear messages being complex and rapidly changing and lacking space of manoeuvre for innovation the european commission put forward a proposal for a regulation setting eu standards for reclaimed water in may 2018 this proposal is based on a jrc report alcalde sanz and gawlik 2017 and is related to the 2015 circular economy action plan ec 2015a the seventh environment action programme decision no 1386 2013 eu 2013 and globally to the un s sustainable development goals the aim is to reduce water stress by promoting the use of treated wastewater in agriculture and encourage the free circulation of products irrigated with reclaimed water alcalde sanz and gawlik 2017 proposing a regulation that sets minimum quality standards at present only few eu member states have set requirements for wastewater reuse the proposed requirements include microbiological e coli legionella spp and intestinal nematodes and physico chemical parameters biochemical oxygen demand bod suspended solids ss and turbidity while micropollutants are not mentioned the proposed legislation would consider irrigation as the only application therefore disregarding possible utilizations in nbs quality standards would be set according to the fit for purpose approach following the world health organization guidelines a risk management plan based on the multiple barrier approach and the hazard analysis and critical control points system analogue to the water safety plan would also be established alcalde sanz and gawlik 2017 however this proposal considers solely reclaimed wastewater that is water complying with the quality standards detailed in the urban waste water treatment directive uwwtd council directive 91 271 eec 1991 excluding other possible sources e g harvested rainwater greywater etc it should be noted that the forthcoming eu standards focused only on reuse of treated wastewater propose improved end of pipe solutions that represent only a mitigation and not a solution of the water stress problem advanced concepts that would tackle reuse at decentralized level and facilitate resource recovery by source separation and source control rather than treatment need to come into force the uwwtd states that in case the investments to build a wwtp would not produce environmental benefit or would entail excessive costs individual systems or other appropriate systems ias which achieve the same level of environmental protection shall be used this creates a sort of a free zone and as a result of this vagueness in legislation a recent report highlights that ias represent a significant source of pollution in eu making the refit of the uwwtd an impellent need ec 2019 in this case the concept of ias could be an opportunity at eu level for the implementation of nbs in the form of small scale decentralized water treatment proven that the systems comply with the required quality standards an example of nbs that could be a suitable option for small scale treatment is treatment wetlands although treatment wetlands cover larger surfaces compared with other technologies they do not need external energy inputs to be operated if the location allows the avoidance of pumps dotro et al 2017 langergraber et al 2019b this results in energy savings and lower operation and maintenance costs which may be proven crucial in areas with limited financial resources langergraber et al 2019b when reviewing scientific literature on nbs little or no relevant data on the risk posed by micropollutants were found micropollutants have been targeted at the priority substances directive directive 39 eu 2013 directive 2013 39 eu 2013 which encompasses the watch list system introduced with a commission implementing decision in a 2015 ec 2015c then updated through decision 2018 480 ec 2018 the watch list is a list of micropollutants that may pose a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment but for which data are still insufficient to support their prioritization and must therefore be monitored europe wide by member states ec 2018 since the monitoring is to be carried out in freshwater only there is a missing link between the occurrence of such pollutants in wastewater and the risk associated to their presence when reclaimed wastewater is reused on the one hand this legislative gap will delay the adoption of a common regulatory framework in the eu for water reuse greywater harvested rainwater or hinder its potential in particular this could prevent from implementing new technologies practises and solutions above all nbs on the other hand the lack of regulations on micropollutants might bring to underestimate the risk posed by such compounds decentralized systems could provide an answer to this problem as they enable better source control and consequently bigger potential and safer resource recovery and reuse moreover the adoption of certain nbs may even improve the removal of micropollutants compared to conventional wwtps as in the case of the treatment wetlands in treatment wetlands the removal efficiencies of many compounds are reported higher than 90 thanks to the coexistence of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic zones within surface flow as well as the concurrence of different mechanisms such as biodegradation sorption plant uptake and in certain cases photodegradation langergraber et al 2019b li et al 2014 verlicchi and zambello 2014 in parallel to setting environmental quality standards the legislation could also focus on preventing micropollutants from entering the water systems for instance improving source control measures the situation outside the eu is different in switzerland the water protection ordinance established that wwtps following certain criteria should be upgraded with advanced treatment by 2035 in order to ensure the removal of at least 80 of micropollutants loads tracking wwtps efficiency by means of periodical monitoring campaigns swiss confederation 2016 other countries outside europe such as california state of california 2013 australia australian government 2018 and singapore pub 2018 have implemented cutting edge policies on water reuse including specific regulations on greywater and direct or non direct potable reuse in some cases micropollutants are also monitored the legislation of these countries might pave the way for implementation at eu level 5 methodologies and indicators assessing water systems a lack of a holistic assessment methodology evaluating nbs as part of water systems and adequately addressing issues of water quantity as well as the regeneration of natural capital was identified in section 3 therefore in this section the research is expanded on currently available methodologies that have been applied to assess the effects of complete water systems on the physical and environmental performance in order to investigate their potential of measuring water circularity this section is organized in three sub sections according to the type of approaches deployed in the reviewed studies i e studies assessing water systems and environmental compartments using mfa based approaches chapter 5 1 consumption based approaches chapter 5 2 and modelling approaches chapter 5 3 the links between these methods nbs and circularity of water systems are identified 5 1 mfa based approaches mfa is one of the most widely used methods to evaluate circularity elia et al 2017 pauliuk 2018 moraga et al 2019 it enables a systemic quantification of materials flows and stocks helping towards the management of resource use and the development of closed loop systems based on the principle of mass conservation in a well defined system mfa focuses on loadings instead of concentrations and provides an overview of the total system enabling the integration of nbs to the complete water system by linking and examining the relationship between the human managed system and the natural environment hendriks et al 2000 focusing on water systems many mfa based assessment methodologies have been developed to evaluate the metabolic and sustainability performance of a specific area or system including the development of indicators used for the assessment table 4 in 2011 kenway and his colleagues developed the concept of urban water metabolism uwm that provides a systematic mass balance framework to quantify all anthropogenic and natural water flows into and out of the urban environment resulting to quantitative performance indicators since then uwm has been expanded to include energy and nutrient flows farooqui et al 2016 renouf et al 2017 2018 therefore uwm can be used to assess the transition from linear to more circular metabolism of complete water systems including the integration of nbs that create a self regulating sustainable relationship with the biosphere similarly verger et al 2018 used territorial metabolism tm to analyse the metabolism of a peri urban area through its nitrogen phosphorus carbon and water flows the main contribution of this study is the inclusion of the occurring natural processes of nutrients as part of the analysis from a circularity perspective the integration of nutrients in the nature managed system is important as it is one of the aspects indicating the achievement of regeneration of natural capital principle agudelo vera et al 2012 developed a methodology i e urban harvest approach uha based on the concept of urban metabolism evaluating and quantifying the multiple potentials of different primary and secondary already used resources that can be utilized within a water system from building to city scale in order to become self sufficient in 2015 leusbrock and his colleagues expand the application of uha to consider energy flows uha is close to the concept of circularity as the three deployed strategies i e minimizing demand minimizing outputs and multi sourcing are similar to the circularity concepts of reduce reuse recycle wielemaker et al 2018 based on the uha developed the harvest to harvest approach h2ha to assess the match between the supply by new sanitation systems and the demand from urban agriculture for nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter in terms of quantity and quality to foster a circular metabolism and to optimize interconnecting systems numerous indicators are resulted from mfa based studies that are able to quantitative and qualitatively measure the metabolic performance and self sufficiency of water systems the developed water nutrient and energy related indicators cover both anthropogenic and natural flows but extended natural nutrient flows are disregarded i e the consideration of natural nutrient cycles this way the extent of closing the water loops and the regeneration of natural capital in terms of water is achievable however emissions and natural nutrient processes and flows and other ecosystem services are disregarded in these indicators mfa based assessment approaches can form the basis for a water circularity assessment methodology of water systems as they have the capability of including both the human managed and the nature managed system i e particularly useful when nbs are part of the analyzed system and simultaneously consider flows stocks and loadings of the water materials and energy pathways however other approaches need to be incorporated in order to consider additional environmental impacts additional environmental benefits and ecosystem services as well as economic aspects in order to fully assess the ability of regenerating the natural capital and designing out waste externalities 5 2 consumption based approaches consumption based approaches quantify the resources including water required to produce goods and services consumed by society and estimate the associated embodied life cycle environmental impacts whether those impacts occur inside or outside the defined boundary of the system baynes and wiedmann 2012 lca is one of the most representative methods of this category and one of the most widely applied to assess the environmental impacts of water systems see section 3 as well as to assess systems from a ce perspective elia et al 2017 pauliuk 2018 baleta et al 2019 moraga et al 2019 the indicators used in lca are well known and they are not presented in this study different practices or technologies to recover raw materials e g phosphorus and energy as well as to reuse water from wastewaters have been investigated by assessing or evaluating technical e g zhou et al 2017 environmental e g pintilie et al 2016 amann et al 2018 dominguez et al 2018 hao et al 2019 pradel and aissani 2019 sylwan et al 2019 and economic e g laitinen et al 2017 aspects additionally buonocore et al 2018 used lca to compare the environmental impacts of linear partially circular and circular scenarios of energy recovery and water reuse in wwtp leong et al 2019 compared the environmental lca and economic lcc impacts of centralized and decentralized options for non potable water uses at a domestic and commercial building similarly zanni et al 2019 compared the environmental impacts and other technical aspects e g system s complexity tanks pumping system etc of centralized and decentralized water systems at single dwelling and apartment buildings assessment of environmental impacts of the entire urban water system was investigated in the studies of lemos et al 2013 considering environmental impacts of lane et al 2015 comparing conventional to diversified urban water infrastructure and of xue et al 2019 considering both environmental and monetary costs however the above mentioned studies trying to address circularity issues by focusing mainly on the environmental impacts fall short of keeping water as the protagonist in terms of circularity i e there is no proof of closing the water loops thus they are not able to make an overall evaluation of the ce benefits i e elimination of waste and regeneration of natural capital it is also reported that the application of lca in complex multifunctional circular water value chains with multiple outputs i e water energy materials and water uses is still challenging reap et al 2008 bobba et al 2018 therefore although these studies have assessed aspects of circularity i e environmental impacts economic efficiency etc of different components of water systems they cannot holistically assess the circularity of water systems however lca if combined with other tools methods can provide useful information in terms of environmental sustainability as part of a water circularity assessment for example the ce principle of design out waste externalities can be assessed with lca especially if combined with lcc or other economic assessments to incorporate the economic aspects of the system additionally lca has been integrated to metabolic approaches in goldstein et al 2013 garcía guaita et al 2018 sohn et al 2018 in order to assess the sustainability of cities metabolisms considering the anthropogenic flows of different materials however to the best of our knowledge such methodological integration has not been performed to water related metabolisms 5 3 modelling approaches mfa based and consumption based approaches can be used to evaluate the circular metabolism i e in terms of water in both human and nature managed systems of energy and of nutrients mainly in human managed systems in a stationary snap shot mode and the potential environmental impacts of the entire life cycle to the environment respectively however the actual environmental impacts the environmental benefits and in general the degradation or regeneration of the natural environment e g considering the nutrients natural cycles is not well addressed therefore modelling approaches are reviewed in this sub section in order to bridge this gap by studying different material cycles simultaneously in addition to interpreting them individually while gaining insight into the magnitude of the associated flows the purpose is to present the state of the art of existing models as tools that can potentially be incorporated in assessment methodologies and existing methodologies deploying modelling approaches that can be used towards a holistic water circularity assessment process based and conceptual hydrologic and biogeochemical models have been developed to simulate the water and nutrients or solutes transport fate and cycling such models are based on a theoretical understanding of relevant ecological processes i e using partial differential equations kinetic laws stoichiometry and balance equations cuddington et al 2013 that enables the consideration of multiple and complex interactions between climate soil geology vegetation hydrology and nutrient balances in addition to this feature computer models interpret dynamically the analyzed system due to the inclusion of temporal and spatial variation and resolution in comparison to the stationary nature of the mfa and consumption based approaches however the main drawback of such models is the required amount of data field and experimental data and model results which increases with increasing mechanization of the model as well as the complexity of the model data intensive complex models impede their wide implementation and use thus more generic models are required that are simpler and easier to apply vadas et al 2013 the reviewed tools i e models are categorized according to their focus pure hydrological models focus on the quantification of the hydrological partitioning i e partitioning of precipitation into streamflow evapotranspiration and storage change agro hydrological models simulate hydrology agricultural water management and in some cases nutrient loads of agricultural areas hydro biochemical models simulate the transport fate and cycling of nutrients on soils and land use including agricultural areas starting with the reviewed hydrological models bellot and chirino 2013 developed an eco hydrological modelling approach i e hydrobal for assessing the water balance with a daily resolution more precisely hydrobal investigates the temporal variability in soil water content determined by vegetation water uptake as a function of climatic conditions i e daily rainfall and micrometeorological variables and the model outputs include actual evapotranspiration runoff and aquifer recharge deep percolation zhang et al 2020 developed a conceptual catchment water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis denoted pwbm to model the hydrological partitioning across spatial and temporal scales the pwbm model inputs require precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf area index and the model outputs are streamflow evapotranspiration and storage change westenbroek et al 2010 developed a modified thornthwaite mather soil water balance swb code combining geographic information system gis data layers and tabular climatological data to calculate spatial and temporal variations in groundwater recharge li et al 2017b developed a model integrating conceptual models in the vadose zone considering various landscape units e g farmland grassland surface water bare soil etc and the groundwater flow model feflow under gis to simulate the hydrological processes under various scenarios of water saving activities the model was applied in the heihe river basin in gansu province of china and validated by comparing the simulated evapotranspiration groundwater levels and the total water balance with remote sensing results previous studies and monitored data one of the most extensively used agro hydrological model at the field scale is the fao 56 dual crop coefficient fao 2kc allen et al 1998 model that estimates the crop water requirements by means of the simulated evapotranspiration and its two components i e evaporation and transpiration another agro hydrological model that can be used to investigate irrigation nutrient and salt management strategies is the research version of the swb model i e swb sci that is a mechanistic real time generic crop growth soil water nutrient and salt balance model annandale et al 1999 2000 van der laan et al 2010 2014 consisting of different sub modules e g water balance sub module and the nitrogen sub module the soil and water assessment tool swat simulates water quality and quantity the impact of land use management practices and climate change arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2012 automatic irrigation algorithms in swat have been tested improved and validated to correctly simulate the hydrological processes in agricultural catchments in response to climate change and water management scenarios e g dechmi et al 2012 githui et al 2016 wei et al 2018 uniyal and dietrich 2019 hydro biogeochemical models simulate the transport fate and cycling of nutrients on agricultural areas and soils considering the interactions with the hydrological processes drainmod p deal et al 1986 tian et al 2012 askar 2019 hype lindström et al 2010 inca p wade et al 2002 jackson blake et al 2016 rzwqm2 p ma et al 2012 sadhukhan and qi 2018 and simply p jackson blake et al 2017 are some of the existing models focusing on the phosphorus transport in soils summarized in the review of pferdmenges et al 2020 the models presented here are the ones that are capable of simulating both surface diffusion desorption and erosion and subsurface infiltration and transport in soil phosphorus processes as well as phosphorus plant uptake additionally all the presented models include all the hydrological compartments i e surface water infiltration groundwater and streamflow which are important if water cycle is included in the analysis their differences mainly lie on the different water flow and solute transport approaches that they use e g storage routing representation or empirical or darcy or richards equations and single dual porosity and dual permeability etc and on the spatial scales i e soil profile plot field and catchment additionally the process based century model parton et al 1987 has been extensively used to dynamically estimate the soil organic carbon stocks the century model is designed to simulate carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur dynamics in natural or cultivated systems using a monthly time step parton et al 1988 shaffer et al 2001 allowing the simulation of the anthropogenic land management and natural climate and soil drivers with the possibility to assess the effect of alternative scenarios other models developed to track and estimate the carbon sequestrated or emitted from both plantations and managed native forests are the co2fix mohren and klein goldewijk 1990 gorcam schlamadinger et al 2000 and fullcam richards and evans 2004 waterworth et al 2007 the review of hydrological agro hydrological and hydro biogeochemical models revealed that there is a variety of available models capable of simulating the environmental processes of water and nutrients hydrological and agro hydrological models can provide more accurate quantification of the hydrological processes on different temporal scales daily monthly seasonal annual that can be used as inputs to water balance equations considering both anthropogenic and natural water flows in order to holistically assess the circularity of water systems biogeochemical models can shed light on the underestimated nutrients cycling in nature and carbon sequestration that would further improve the environmental and physical assessment of the system as well as the evaluation of the environmental benefits therefore such models can effectively include nbs as most of them use environmental processes to address societal challenges and can be used within a water circularity assessment methodology integrating the ecosystem perspective which is currently the missing element within the other reviewed approaches and methods however to the best of our knowledge these models have not been incorporated to water assessment methodologies thus indicators targeting at the ecosystems cannot be identified in this case the selection of the model to be incorporated in a water circularity assessment methodology is of major importance as models with high complexity would burden their wide use and adoption while very simplistic models would not accurately describe the system resulting in unrealistic conclusions the model should also be able to sufficiently and simultaneously describe the environmental processes of water and all nutrients in order to avoid the need of incorporating different models for different purposes which would result in high complexity and computational time attention should be given in case that such models are used in parallel with consumption based approaches such as lca as the actual environmental impacts resulting from the former and the potential impacts resulting from the latter may conflict with each other and be double counted the previously reviewed models have been used as standalone tools by the researchers villarroel walker 2010 developed a multi sectoral systems analysis msa methodology for understanding and managing the metabolism of complex systems supported by a set of socio ecological indicators the environmental model was coded in matlab incorporating substance flow analysis sfa and regionalized sensitivity analysis rsa in order to track and account for the movement of water energy nitrogen phosphorus and carbon into around and out of a regional city system considering multiple socio economic sectors i e water energy food forestry and waste management and the interactions amongst them however the focus of this study is on the production system rather than the water system itself with the developed indicators table 5 covering aspects of circularity i e the direct or indirect regeneration of natural capital and the design out waste externalities from its environmental dimension the indicators are not able to evaluate the principle of keeping resources in use by measuring the extent of closing the water energy and nutrients loops 6 compilation of findings the current review paper addressed two main questions regarding circularity in water systems what needs to be measured to assess water circularity and how can water circularity be measured the answer to the first question was found in the white papers of stuchtey 2015 iwa 2016 and arup et al 2018 and it is the realization of the three ce principles of natural capital regeneration keeping resources in use and designing out waste externalities the water nutrients and other materials as well as the energy pathways need to be followed within both human and nature managed systems arup et al 2018 this analysis would enable the consideration of physical natural and anthropogenic water nutrients materials and energy flows environmental actual impacts e g increase or loss of biodiversity and potential impacts e g global warming potential and economic e g eco efficiency aspects most of these aspects can be measured using already developed indicators table 6 regarding the second question a variety of existing methodologies and tools were identified that have been presently used to assess nbs for water management water systems and water related environmental compartments these methodologies are capable to measure the different aspects of water circularity as illustrated in table 6 the information given in table 6 can be used to get better insights on what is still missing to holistically assess the circularity of water systems the lack of a holistic water circularity assessment methodology is apparent as well as a water circularity assessment framework to rigidly frame the assessment methodologies however there is a variety of existing methods and tools that if incorporated are able to cover all the different aspects of circularity assessment in water systems additionally although a wide set of indicators exists in the literature covering most of the aspects of circularity indicators measuring the environmental performance of water systems in terms of natural nutrients cycles are still missing the existence of numerous indicators does not necessarily mean that they are capable of adequately and holistically measure circularity in water systems the development of a water circularity assessment methodology would prove their adequateness and a potential requirement for the use of new indicators 7 conclusions the concept of water circularity is not well addressed within the research community and there is an apparent lack of a water circularity assessment framework currently available circularity methodologies focusing mainly on the consumer goods sector are not easily transferable to the water sector a failure to adequately evaluate water circularity by considering both human managed and nature managed systems would result in scattered and fragmented actions insufficient to deal with the degradation of our most essential and valuable resource and of our natural capital in turn therefore the present study identifies the positioning of water within the ce concept and how nbs can enable the transition to ce by shedding light on what needs to be measured and how to measure water circularity nbs as human interventions to address societal challenges by enhancing natural processes can play a key role in re connecting nature to human managed water systems however researchers mainly focus on the technical performance of nbs and the evaluation of some of their co benefits the connection of nbs to the wider water system and environment water quantity issues as well as a holistic assessment methodology still remain gaps concerning the assessment methodologies of water systems mfa based approaches are capable of mapping all the natural and anthropogenic water and water related flows in a well defined system and provide a wide set of indicators however the natural cycles of nutrients are not holistically considered lca based approaches include well established indicators focusing on the potential environmental impacts of anthropogenic water systems but fall short both of showing the actual impacts and of incorporating natural elements in the assessment to bridge those gaps hydro biogeochemical models can be incorporated enabling the consideration of the natural environment in the assessment the selection of the appropriate model should be based both on its capability to consider different aspects and on its simplicity that would enable its wider use and application a question however remains on how to incorporate different methods and models within a holistic water systems circularity assessment therefore future research in the topic should address current challenges requirements limitations and barriers leading in the development of a water circularity assessment framework and enabling researchers and practitioners to

17729,water has been pushed into a linear model which is increasingly acknowledged of causing cumulative emissions of pollutants waste stocks and impacting on the irreversible deterioration of water and other resources moving towards a circular model in the water sector the configuration of future water infrastructure changes through the integration of grey and green infrastructure forming nature based solutions nbs as an integral component that connects human managed to nature managed water systems in this study a thorough appraisal of the latest literature is conducted providing an overview of the existing tools methodologies and indicators that have been used to assess nbs for water management as well as complete water systems considering the need of assessing both anthropogenic and natural elements furthermore facilitators and barriers with respect to existing policies and regulations on nbs and circularity have been identified the study concludes that the co benefits of nbs for water management are not adequately assessed a holistic methodology assessing complete water systems from a circularity perspective is still needed integrating existing tools i e hydro biogeochemical

being socio economic development as well as in sustainable ecosystem services unep 2009 water is itself the most valuable and universal resource and at the same time water contains nutrients and water is viewed as a carrier of energy thus water systems intersect with all sections of society industry and the natural environment iwa 2016 arup et al 2018 over the past years the increased stress on limited water resources has reached a critical level in terms of both reduced water availability and jeopardized water quality sgroi et al 2018 the ecosystems could not function without sufficient water supplies of appropriate quality making water scarcity a key stressor in many ecosystems voulvoulis 2018 on top global demand for water is expected to exceed viable resources by 40 by 2030 if we continue business as usual wintgens et al 2016 therefore the challenge is to meet or manage the competing demand for water to minimize the damage to the environment and to regenerate the natural ecosystems wwap 2018 water in nature represents one big cycle maintained by natural processes e g precipitation infiltration evapotranspiration condensation etc which is interrupted by urbanization and by man made water systems therefore water has been pushed into the linear model of take make consume and dispose which is economically unsustainable and causes a successive degradation of water quality as water travels through the system stuchtey 2015 in response to the linear pattern of growth the adoption of the circular economy ce model is proposed that decouples economic growth and development from the consumption of finite sources murray et al 2017 babbitt et al 2018 hofmann 2019 in order to deploy and enhance circularity a number of studies have focused on identifying priority areas of action hislop and hill 2011 ec 2015a emf 2017 emf and wef 2017 emf 2018 emf and arup 2019 water was identified as one of the key priority resources by hislop and hill 2011 the rest of the working groups mainly focus on the consumer goods sector mentioning the preservation of water but the importance of closing the water loops is not well addressed single indicators assessing the circularity of products either qualitative or quantitative have been developed in various academic studies the portfolio includes the circular economy toolkit cet evans and bocken 2013 the material circularity indicator mci emf and granta design 2015 the circular economy indicator prototype ceip griffiths and cayzer 2016 the longevity indicator franklin johnson et al 2016 and an economic value based circularity metric linder et al 2017 these indicators focus on the technical cycles while disregarding the biological cycles which are of major importance in the water sector they target at materials preservation with strategies such as recycling which is only one aspect of circularity and even misleading in the water sector water cannot be manufactured by recycled materials as water is a raw material itself thus preservation of materials can only be applied in the drinking water treatment plants dwtps and wastewater treatment plants wwtps in order to recover nutrients salts and metals that can be used in other interconnected systems such as agriculture and industry these strategies are good for preserving raw materials stocks but the preservation of water stocks is poorly addressed on the other hand pauliuk 2018 proposed a dashboard of new and established indicators based on material flow analysis mfa material flow cost accounting mfca and life cycle assessment lca to assess five main characteristics i e restore regenerate maintain utility maintain financial value and maintain nonfinancial value as well as four complementary characteristics i e resource efficiency climate energy and sufficiency in the water sector three reports have been published up to date i e stuchtey 2015 iwa 2016 arup et al 2018 conceptually describing what should be considered in order to create circular water systems they highlight the importance of establishing different water functionalities e g consumptive and non consumptive water water as a durable that would enable the balance between water withdrawals and return flows the consideration of water materials and energy pathways in order to create synergies within and outside the water sector the need for an integrated urban resource management is also highlighted looking at the water cycle from catchment to consumer and back to catchment following a systems approach that reveals interconnections between the human managed and nature managed systems at the core of circular water systems lies the realization of the three principles identified by arup et al 2018 i e design out waste externalities keep resources in use and regenerate natural capital however to the best of our knowledge this approach has not yet been applied into practice for developing an assessment methodology for circular water systems the transition to circular water systems requires the redesign of the water infrastructure the utilization of recent developments in technology and the integration of nature based ecosystems to the grey infrastructure i e hybrid infrastructure o hogain and mccarton 2018 existing concepts and approaches using and enhancing nature such as ecosystem based adaptation eba green infrastructure gi ecosystem services ess and nature based solutions nbs have gained momentum as they tackle challenges e g climate mitigation and adaptation water management degradation and loss of natural capital disaster risk reduction etc in a more sustainable way compared to the conventional hard engineering while all four concepts share the common principle of multifunctionality nbs can be considered as an umbrella to the other concepts with a strong solution oriented focus and biodiversity lying at its core pauleit et al 2017 up to date several definitions have been applied to describe nbs e g the definitions provided by ec 2015b cohen shacham et al 2016 raymond et al 2017 o hogain and mccarton 2018 langergraber et al 2019a according to them nbs should be cost effective resource efficient and locally adapted nbs are systemic interventions that bring more and more diverse nature and natural features and processes they address either a specific problem i e societal challenge or multiple challenges and simultaneously provide environmental social and economic benefits such as biodiversity climate change mitigation and adaptation resilience human well being etc while ce seeks to reduce environmental stress of socio economic activities nbs have the potential to enhance environmental and ecological status and to address human demand for natural resources nbs can restore the crucial natural processes by changing the fluxes of water sediment nutrients and pollutants that drive the water cycle and thus return the circularity to the water systems nbs are also capable of resources recovery from water like nutrients which fits in the natural water and nutrients cycles facilitating the transition from open to closed loops therefore the synergies fostered between the two concepts bring nbs to the forefront of enabling the realization of circular water systems this study is conducted in order to shed light on the assessment of circular water systems and the integration of nbs as enablers to water circularity by addressing two main questions what are the main parameters that should be considered in circular water systems i e section 2 and what methods could be deployed in order to holistically assess the circularity of water systems considering that nbs can be used as means to integrate nature to human managed systems a thorough investigation on the current state of nbs is carried out this is followed by a literature review on the assessment methodologies that have been applied to evaluate their performance including indicators that have been used developed as metrics of performance i e section 3 current regulations and policies that act as barriers or facilitators for implementing nbs are also reviewed i e section 4 the third part i e section 5 reviews existing tools methods and indicators for assessing the performance of water systems and elaborates on their suitability to evaluate key circularity aspects the last part i e section 6 concludes on what methods and indicators can be used and what is still missing in order to holistically assess the circularity of water systems 2 circularity in water systems what needs to be measured in view of the lack of a water circularity definition the white papers of stuchtey 2015 iwa 2016 and arup et al 2018 are considered in this study to understand what needs to be measured for assessing circularity in water systems the three principles of regenerate natural capital keep resources in use and design out waste externalities should be assessed following the water energy and materials nutrients pathways the three principles indicate the requirement of a systems approach as well as the consideration of the interactions between natural and human managed systems water related human managed systems encompass various socio economic sectors i e urban water sector agricultural food sector energy sector and industrial sector with agriculture and industries accounting for the highest global water withdrawals fao 2016 therefore water circularity needs to consider all water users and not being managed at a sectoral level to this extent water circularity can only be achieved in a multi sectoral system including both human managed and nature managed systems natural and anthropogenic water cycles should be closed and symbiotic management of resources be promoted avoiding burden shifting both from one sector to the other but also from the anthroposphere to the environment to achieve and assess water circularity the goals of the different ce principles are explained the goal of the regenerate natural capital principle is to ensure functional environmental flows and stocks by reducing the anthropogenic water uses preserving and enhancing ecosystems and ensuring minimum disruptions from human interactions and use in order to assess this principle selected assets of ecological integrity and of regulating provisioning and cultural ecosystem services are proposed to be considered ecological integrity targets at reducing water and nutrient loss and storage capacity of nutrients and water i e soil nutrient retention soil organic matter soil water storage regulating ecosystem services are targeted at climate regulation i e sources and sinks of ghgs groundwater recharge and nutrient regulation provisioning ecosystem services target at crops livestock and fodder while cultural ecosystem services focus on recreation and aesthetic values the goal of keep resources in use principle is actually to close the water and water related materials and energy loops within the system it can be achieved by optimizing resource yields optimizing energy and resource extraction and by maximizing recycling and reuse recirculation of resources to close the loops requires sufficient quantity of the reused resources and suitable quality to meet the internal demands which would result in a reduction of the amount of resources that are abstracted from the nature and the amount of returning flows the design out waste externalities principle focuses on both the reduction of waste and the economic efficiency of the system i e the costs of reducing waste by one unit is equal to the economic and environmental benefits of having one less unit of waste the reduction is achieved by taking actions to achieve the keep resources in use principle while the remaining waste i e gaseous liquid and solid has impacts on the environmental system affecting the regeneration of natural capital principle therefore the environmental impacts the avoided negative environmental impacts and the economic benefits and costs need to be considered in the assessment all three ce principles can be achieved by modifying current systems and grey infrastructure while classical grey infrastructure can be designed to enhance water reuse and resources recovery it differs significantly from the concept and paradigm of nbs nbs are using natural processes i e they work with nature while grey systems infrastructure use additional energy to achieve circularity introducing nbs to urban water management naturally enhances circularity of the urban water system hence shifts the urban water management into ce water in the ce should be placed without unnecessary additional energy use which for the modification of the existing grey water infrastructure would be inevitable in particular the implementation of nbs can lead not only to modifications but rather to new hybrid systems more sufficiently applying the three principles for example constructed wetlands treating road runoff will prevent pollution of water bodies recharge groundwater and increase biodiversity wetland roofs will collect and treat rainwater to be used for non potable domestic purposes while simultaneously acting as a natural air conditioning that is cost effective and resource efficient therefore nbs by exploiting their multifunctionality can facilitate the transition to circular water systems the implementation of a single nbs may simultaneously obtain multiple co benefits related to circularity and achieve the same result with traditional grey infrastructure where multiple mono functional engineering solutions are required additionally the fact that nbs interconnect nature managed to human managed systems leads to their consideration as a key element to identifying methods to holistically assess circularity of water systems any water circularity assessment can be undertaken at three different scales i e micro single components meso interconnected components forming a system and macro catchment city region or national assessment methodologies at any scale need to take into consideration the other scales of assessment as well in order to add significant value and become applicable therefore the interlinkages that the analyzed system has with other systems and scales needs to be considered as well by providing the information required for the assessment at higher scales fig 1 which illustrates how the information obtained from the assessment at a small scale provides feedback to the next assessment scale until the puzzle of water circularity of a basin is completed the puzzle diagram is followed in the present review of the currently available methodologies assessing nbs at different scales and water systems in order to identify the required information that would shed light on how to assess water circularity 3 nbs enabling circularity in water systems systematic literature review a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the current state of nbs to enhance circularity of water systems targeting at publications from scientific journals identified from the databases of scopus and science direct the key words that were selected i e nature based solution water water system circular economy circularity and assessment were used in multiple combinations as presented in fig 2 and the search conducted throughout the whole text was expanded to all article types among the identified papers 323 studies were categorized based on the main societal challenge to be tackled and their numerical proportions are illustrated in the pie diagram of fig 2 the connection of nbs to the concept of circularity especially in water systems is not well addressed by the researchers bar chart results additionally the pie diagram of fig 2 illustrates that only 7 and 3 of the research focuses on water security and water quality respectively the studies dealing with water security and water quality were analyzed to understand the extent to which they address water related issues the water related studies assessing different aspects of nbs performance are summarized based on their context in table 1 the study of castonguay et al 2018 is the only one identified dealing with social aspects this study focuses on the evaluation of different strategies for technology adoption to help decision making by simulating the interactions of regulatory bodies and households within an agent based model integrating economic and environmental factors their results indicate that using economic instruments alone may have been insufficient to promote the adoption of rainwater tanks and that water restrictions have had a major impact on the uptake additionally the study of reynaud et al 2017 used a contingent valuation approach to estimate the willingness to pay wtp of households to different multipurpose infrastructures conventional or green for managing flood and water pollution they concluded that there is an excessive willingness to pay for green infrastructure in comparison to conventional systems the wtp in this study was influenced by people s income and their visits from gorla maggiore water park the optimization of certain parameters of stormwater and wastewater treatment systems including nbs to improve their design has been performed in three studies andres domenech et al 2018 considered runoff characterization and volume and rainfall depth to improve the design of source control systems cáceres et al 2018 developed a statistical tool to select the most adequate withdrawal depth for optimizing the wastewater treatment processes moezzibadi et al 2019 evaluated the filtering performance related to suspended solids loads of constructed wetlands to improve their design the technical evaluation of the nbs has been performed in the studies of hernandes crespo et al 2017 geronimo et al 2019 haddis et al 2020 krzeminski et al 2019 jurczak et al 2018 masseroni et al 2018 and licciardello et al 2018 these studies consider water quality parameters and or water retention capacity as the main aspects of their evaluation including in some cases costs licciardello et al 2018 masseroni et al 2018 krzeminski et al 2019 and biodiversity hernández crespo et al 2017 hernandes crespo et al 2017 however the scope of these studies is narrow focusing on the technical performance or the design optimization and they do not assess holistically the proposed solutions e g potential co benefits are excluded from the evaluation the studies of chow et al 2014 liquete et al 2016 boelee et al 2017 bricker et al 2017 garfí et al 2017 li et al 2017 radinja et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 were identified as more relevant for the purpose of this work they either deploy a more holistic assessment or consider aspects relevant to assess water circularity sub section 3 1 the studies considering economic aspects of nbs are analyzed in sub section 3 2 3 1 methodologies and indicators assessing nbs for water circularity the eight studies identified in the previous section are categorized based on the methods that they deploy for assessment i e water balance lca modeling and combination of different tools the indicators developed used in the reviewed studies are presented in table 2 and they are compared to the different water management aspects identified in eklipse framework table 2 developed by raymond et al 2017 the sufficiency of the different aspects considered in the studies to holistically assess nbs for water management and their potential contribution to circularity of water systems are investigated a water balance method is used in the study of bricker et al 2017 that presents a vision exercise to study the impacts of different interventions on groundwater balance at city level water balance can be used to assess the increase in infiltration and water storage which is one of the main considerations when assessing nbs for water management according to eklipse framework table 2 however this study does not apply a holistic assessment methodology as only one aspect i e groundwater storage is evaluated the study of bricker et al 2017 is the only one identified among the studies analyzed in this section that deploys a semi quantitative water balance approach to investigate how specific interventions impact water systems considering both anthropogenic and natural water flows the consideration of mass balances from a circularity perspective i e to close the water loops are of major importance and similar studies are reviewed in section 5 lca is used by garfí et al 2017 to assess the environmental impacts of a conventional infrastructure and two nbs technologies as alternatives for wastewater treatment in small communities the indicators used for the assessment are presented in table 2 one of the strongest advantages of lca is the fact that it is a standardized and well established method for the evaluation of the environmental impacts for the entire life cycle of a product process or service iso 1997 hertwich 2005 and it is widely used to compare the environmental sustainability of different water technologies e g pan et al 2011 manso et al 2018 guertin et al 2019 pan et al 2019 oquendo di cosola et al 2020 however when it comes to the assessment of nbs following the eklipse framework table 2 none of the highlighted considerations can be addressed using lca there are three main constraints firstly the high level of abstraction associated with the lca results leads to potential rather than actual impacts thus there is a generalization of the lca impacts that do not refer to specific cases pizzol et al 2015 bai et al 2018 nbs on the other hand should be locally adapted mandating environmental evaluations to be tailored to local environments secondly lca focuses more on the environmental costs e g biodiversity loss rather than the environmental gains e g carbon sequestration rugani et al 2019 thirdly the consideration of feedback loops between processes across the anthropogenic and the natural environment are generally neglected in lca weidema et al 2018 this means that the effects on ecosystems driven by changes occurred in the anthropogenic systems are not considered which further neglects the consideration of the effects of those changes back to the anthropogenic systems underestimating the actual load of the life cycle impacts therefore lca is very useful for comparing alternative solutions but not for assessing actual environmental impacts and the interconnections between natural and human managed systems modeling projected scenarios are deployed in the studies of boelee et al 2017 and zhang et al 2019 to assess the performance of nbs under future climatic conditions boelee et al 2017 developed a model to evaluate the performance of alternative scenarios to address simultaneously water management challenges i e water shortages pollution deterioration of aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity loss under future projections in terms of urbanization climate change and increasing demands for food production and hydropower zhang et al 2019 used a model to examine the implications of climate change on future rainfall and evaluate the reliability of water sensitive urban design wsud stormwater infrastructure in pollution reduction flow frequency mitigation and reliability as an alternative water supply both studies are able to address some of the key points identified in the eklipse framework table 2 under dynamic time and spatial variations of the system however scenario analysis modeling is more relevant for investigating options for the future rather than the actual state of the system therefore process understanding modeling is considered more appropriate for water circularity assessment and relevant studies are reviewed in section 5 more holistic approaches resulted from combination of different tools and methods were adopted in the studies of liquete et al 2016 chow et al 2014 li et al 2017a and radinja et al 2019 liquete et al 2016 deployed a runoff model water quality measurements biological samplings surveys satellite images arcgis and fragstat software to assess multiple environmental economic and social benefits of a set of cws surrounded by a park to treat the excess flow of mixed sewage and rainwater during heavy rain events chow et al 2014 developed a systemic multi criteria decision support framework to evaluate the design of grey green drainage infrastructure based on quantitative measures i e indicators covering energy environment water quantity and quality criteria and monetary costs and benefits li et al 2017 developed a benefit evaluation system for low impact development of urban stormwater management measures based on analytic hierarchy process and urban stormwater model including environmental i e water quantity and quality economic i e civil construction and maintenance costs and social i e rainwater reuse landscape value and ecological function benefits radinja et al 2019 used a framework based on hydrology hydraulic modeling and multi criteria analysis mca to evaluate co benefits i e combined sewer overflow reduction capex opex amenity biodiversity and ownership of sustainable drainage systems suds resulting in favorable scenarios for stormwater control measures although these studies consider several water management criteria for their evaluations see table 2 water quantity which is important to investigate the extent of closing the water loops and the enhancement of the natural water cycle is not well addressed although there is a variety of developed used indicators among the different studies they are not able to cover all the different aspects of water management i e the water management criteria identified in the eklipse framework as shown in table 2 most of the studies focus on the main societal challenge to be addressed by nbs i e water quality issues and flood risk underestimating the enhancement of the natural environment e g the natural water cycle is not considered and many co benefits e g carbon storage capacity is not evaluated by any of the reviewed studies another issue is the scale of assessment nbs are assessed as individual components i e detached from the complete water system neglecting the whole supply chain i e upstream and downstream processes and flows the systems thinking the interconnections between these processes and feedbacks and therefore the impacts to the natural and urban water system a fragmented approach of understanding isolated parts of the water system increases the risk of implementing solutions that may be inefficient due to overlooking many dynamic and aggregated effects that emerge at larger scales i e due to the complex interactions of the different components with their surroundings thorslund et al 2017 this may result in overestimation of the effectiveness of nbs if assessed at small scales but also insufficiency to assess circularity of water systems 3 2 methodologies and indicators economically assessing nbs while nbs appear to be capable of addressing water management challenges and enhancing ecosystem services the debate on how to valuate nature its attributes and services in monetary terms is still open as they are not goods directly traded in the markets bockarjova and botzen 2017 this section focuses on commonly used methods for economic evaluation of nbs i e life cycle cost analysis lcca cost benefit analysis cba cost effectiveness analysis cea and natural capital accounting lcca is an economic assessment that accounts for all the relevant costs throughout the entire life cycle of a product service or process enabling the comparison between different alternatives bhoye et al 2016 life cycle costing lcc considers investment implementation operation maintenance and end of life e g disposal and residual value costs benefits cash flows according to the directive 24 eu 2014 directive 2014 24 eu 2014 it can also include costs related to environmental externalities e g greenhouse gas emissions the results of lcca are expressed using an economic measure e g net present value npv benefit cost ratio bcr payback period pp and annual lcc economic assessment based on lcca has been performed by many researchers to evaluate the economic impacts e g of rainwater harvesting systems e g roebuck et al 2011 amos et al 2018a green roofs e g ziogou et al 2018 including the monetization of the avoided environmental deterioration waste management alternatives lee et al 2020 urban vegetation sicard et al 2018 one of the main limitations of lcca is that environmental and economic benefits that are not easy to be monetized e g reduction in urban flooding biodiversity increase increased property value due to aesthetic improvement etc tend to get lost potentially prejudicing the decisions amos et al 2018b ziogou et al 2018 the same limitation stands for cba as it calculates the total costs related to a project monetizes the obtained environmental and social benefits and compares the results to identify the most efficient alternative hansson 2007 however cba is considered as one of the most widely applied tools for economic analysis balanay and halog 2019 and it is used to economically evaluate nbs for example feng and hewage 2018 used cba to assess the payback period of green roofs in different markets considering life cycle costs public and individual benefits cba considering public and private costs and benefits was also deployed by reddy et al 2015 to assess water shortages risk of alternative scenarios including nbs cea is proposed by boerema et al 2018 as an alternative economic evaluation method for environmental management in order to overcome the limitation of cba of expressing benefits into explicit monetary terms therefore cea identifies the most cost effective strategy by comparing the investment costs to achieve a specific goal or measure of effectiveness expressed in any unit e g biodiversity conservation helm and hepburn 2012 greenhouse gas emission reduction macleod et al 2010 water provision improvement yang 2011 however in cea each measure of effectiveness is treated separately due to the different units thus their integration for assessing whether the total benefits exceed the total costs is not always possible natural capital accounting is defined by philips 2017 as a series of interconnected physical and monetary accounts that provide a structured set of information related to the stocks of natural capital and flows of services supplied by them monetary accounts are referred to annual monetization of selected services resulting in an overall valuation of the natural asset s ability to generate future flows of services for example vogl et al 2017 discussed the importance of watersheds natural capital valuation increase i e the cost of maintaining the natural capital in healthy watersheds that contributes to public good and private values of the uptake and impact of investments in watershed services although non market goods such as many ecosystem services do not have direct exchange values i e the supply value equals the use value natural capital accounting is based on the concept of exchange value thus the monetary valuation of non market goods is based on estimations as if a market existed philips 2017 therefore such estimated exchange values increase the uncertainty of this method table 3 presents indicators that have been used in literature while some established economic values e g npv bcr pp capex opex exist and are used in the studies most indicators are case specific even within the lcca method the lcc indicator is interpreted differently among the studies e g lee et al 2020 consider the revenue from products while ziogou et al 2018 consider the environmental cost of emissions especially for cba and cae the costs and benefits effectiveness measures strongly depend on the scope of each study and often the economic assessment is based on economic analysis e g economic and environmental or ecologic balance of the system rather than development of indicators 4 nbs for water implementation barriers and potential risks in recent years the concepts of circular economy and nbs have been promoted and encouraged at eu level ec 2015a ec 2015b however in some cases current policies and regulations designed for a linear economy paradigm are likely to hinder rather than encourage their implementation as evidenced in the study of stewart et al 2016 regulations can act as barriers that prevent the adoption of innovative sustainable approaches e g giving unclear messages being complex and rapidly changing and lacking space of manoeuvre for innovation the european commission put forward a proposal for a regulation setting eu standards for reclaimed water in may 2018 this proposal is based on a jrc report alcalde sanz and gawlik 2017 and is related to the 2015 circular economy action plan ec 2015a the seventh environment action programme decision no 1386 2013 eu 2013 and globally to the un s sustainable development goals the aim is to reduce water stress by promoting the use of treated wastewater in agriculture and encourage the free circulation of products irrigated with reclaimed water alcalde sanz and gawlik 2017 proposing a regulation that sets minimum quality standards at present only few eu member states have set requirements for wastewater reuse the proposed requirements include microbiological e coli legionella spp and intestinal nematodes and physico chemical parameters biochemical oxygen demand bod suspended solids ss and turbidity while micropollutants are not mentioned the proposed legislation would consider irrigation as the only application therefore disregarding possible utilizations in nbs quality standards would be set according to the fit for purpose approach following the world health organization guidelines a risk management plan based on the multiple barrier approach and the hazard analysis and critical control points system analogue to the water safety plan would also be established alcalde sanz and gawlik 2017 however this proposal considers solely reclaimed wastewater that is water complying with the quality standards detailed in the urban waste water treatment directive uwwtd council directive 91 271 eec 1991 excluding other possible sources e g harvested rainwater greywater etc it should be noted that the forthcoming eu standards focused only on reuse of treated wastewater propose improved end of pipe solutions that represent only a mitigation and not a solution of the water stress problem advanced concepts that would tackle reuse at decentralized level and facilitate resource recovery by source separation and source control rather than treatment need to come into force the uwwtd states that in case the investments to build a wwtp would not produce environmental benefit or would entail excessive costs individual systems or other appropriate systems ias which achieve the same level of environmental protection shall be used this creates a sort of a free zone and as a result of this vagueness in legislation a recent report highlights that ias represent a significant source of pollution in eu making the refit of the uwwtd an impellent need ec 2019 in this case the concept of ias could be an opportunity at eu level for the implementation of nbs in the form of small scale decentralized water treatment proven that the systems comply with the required quality standards an example of nbs that could be a suitable option for small scale treatment is treatment wetlands although treatment wetlands cover larger surfaces compared with other technologies they do not need external energy inputs to be operated if the location allows the avoidance of pumps dotro et al 2017 langergraber et al 2019b this results in energy savings and lower operation and maintenance costs which may be proven crucial in areas with limited financial resources langergraber et al 2019b when reviewing scientific literature on nbs little or no relevant data on the risk posed by micropollutants were found micropollutants have been targeted at the priority substances directive directive 39 eu 2013 directive 2013 39 eu 2013 which encompasses the watch list system introduced with a commission implementing decision in a 2015 ec 2015c then updated through decision 2018 480 ec 2018 the watch list is a list of micropollutants that may pose a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment but for which data are still insufficient to support their prioritization and must therefore be monitored europe wide by member states ec 2018 since the monitoring is to be carried out in freshwater only there is a missing link between the occurrence of such pollutants in wastewater and the risk associated to their presence when reclaimed wastewater is reused on the one hand this legislative gap will delay the adoption of a common regulatory framework in the eu for water reuse greywater harvested rainwater or hinder its potential in particular this could prevent from implementing new technologies practises and solutions above all nbs on the other hand the lack of regulations on micropollutants might bring to underestimate the risk posed by such compounds decentralized systems could provide an answer to this problem as they enable better source control and consequently bigger potential and safer resource recovery and reuse moreover the adoption of certain nbs may even improve the removal of micropollutants compared to conventional wwtps as in the case of the treatment wetlands in treatment wetlands the removal efficiencies of many compounds are reported higher than 90 thanks to the coexistence of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic zones within surface flow as well as the concurrence of different mechanisms such as biodegradation sorption plant uptake and in certain cases photodegradation langergraber et al 2019b li et al 2014 verlicchi and zambello 2014 in parallel to setting environmental quality standards the legislation could also focus on preventing micropollutants from entering the water systems for instance improving source control measures the situation outside the eu is different in switzerland the water protection ordinance established that wwtps following certain criteria should be upgraded with advanced treatment by 2035 in order to ensure the removal of at least 80 of micropollutants loads tracking wwtps efficiency by means of periodical monitoring campaigns swiss confederation 2016 other countries outside europe such as california state of california 2013 australia australian government 2018 and singapore pub 2018 have implemented cutting edge policies on water reuse including specific regulations on greywater and direct or non direct potable reuse in some cases micropollutants are also monitored the legislation of these countries might pave the way for implementation at eu level 5 methodologies and indicators assessing water systems a lack of a holistic assessment methodology evaluating nbs as part of water systems and adequately addressing issues of water quantity as well as the regeneration of natural capital was identified in section 3 therefore in this section the research is expanded on currently available methodologies that have been applied to assess the effects of complete water systems on the physical and environmental performance in order to investigate their potential of measuring water circularity this section is organized in three sub sections according to the type of approaches deployed in the reviewed studies i e studies assessing water systems and environmental compartments using mfa based approaches chapter 5 1 consumption based approaches chapter 5 2 and modelling approaches chapter 5 3 the links between these methods nbs and circularity of water systems are identified 5 1 mfa based approaches mfa is one of the most widely used methods to evaluate circularity elia et al 2017 pauliuk 2018 moraga et al 2019 it enables a systemic quantification of materials flows and stocks helping towards the management of resource use and the development of closed loop systems based on the principle of mass conservation in a well defined system mfa focuses on loadings instead of concentrations and provides an overview of the total system enabling the integration of nbs to the complete water system by linking and examining the relationship between the human managed system and the natural environment hendriks et al 2000 focusing on water systems many mfa based assessment methodologies have been developed to evaluate the metabolic and sustainability performance of a specific area or system including the development of indicators used for the assessment table 4 in 2011 kenway and his colleagues developed the concept of urban water metabolism uwm that provides a systematic mass balance framework to quantify all anthropogenic and natural water flows into and out of the urban environment resulting to quantitative performance indicators since then uwm has been expanded to include energy and nutrient flows farooqui et al 2016 renouf et al 2017 2018 therefore uwm can be used to assess the transition from linear to more circular metabolism of complete water systems including the integration of nbs that create a self regulating sustainable relationship with the biosphere similarly verger et al 2018 used territorial metabolism tm to analyse the metabolism of a peri urban area through its nitrogen phosphorus carbon and water flows the main contribution of this study is the inclusion of the occurring natural processes of nutrients as part of the analysis from a circularity perspective the integration of nutrients in the nature managed system is important as it is one of the aspects indicating the achievement of regeneration of natural capital principle agudelo vera et al 2012 developed a methodology i e urban harvest approach uha based on the concept of urban metabolism evaluating and quantifying the multiple potentials of different primary and secondary already used resources that can be utilized within a water system from building to city scale in order to become self sufficient in 2015 leusbrock and his colleagues expand the application of uha to consider energy flows uha is close to the concept of circularity as the three deployed strategies i e minimizing demand minimizing outputs and multi sourcing are similar to the circularity concepts of reduce reuse recycle wielemaker et al 2018 based on the uha developed the harvest to harvest approach h2ha to assess the match between the supply by new sanitation systems and the demand from urban agriculture for nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter in terms of quantity and quality to foster a circular metabolism and to optimize interconnecting systems numerous indicators are resulted from mfa based studies that are able to quantitative and qualitatively measure the metabolic performance and self sufficiency of water systems the developed water nutrient and energy related indicators cover both anthropogenic and natural flows but extended natural nutrient flows are disregarded i e the consideration of natural nutrient cycles this way the extent of closing the water loops and the regeneration of natural capital in terms of water is achievable however emissions and natural nutrient processes and flows and other ecosystem services are disregarded in these indicators mfa based assessment approaches can form the basis for a water circularity assessment methodology of water systems as they have the capability of including both the human managed and the nature managed system i e particularly useful when nbs are part of the analyzed system and simultaneously consider flows stocks and loadings of the water materials and energy pathways however other approaches need to be incorporated in order to consider additional environmental impacts additional environmental benefits and ecosystem services as well as economic aspects in order to fully assess the ability of regenerating the natural capital and designing out waste externalities 5 2 consumption based approaches consumption based approaches quantify the resources including water required to produce goods and services consumed by society and estimate the associated embodied life cycle environmental impacts whether those impacts occur inside or outside the defined boundary of the system baynes and wiedmann 2012 lca is one of the most representative methods of this category and one of the most widely applied to assess the environmental impacts of water systems see section 3 as well as to assess systems from a ce perspective elia et al 2017 pauliuk 2018 baleta et al 2019 moraga et al 2019 the indicators used in lca are well known and they are not presented in this study different practices or technologies to recover raw materials e g phosphorus and energy as well as to reuse water from wastewaters have been investigated by assessing or evaluating technical e g zhou et al 2017 environmental e g pintilie et al 2016 amann et al 2018 dominguez et al 2018 hao et al 2019 pradel and aissani 2019 sylwan et al 2019 and economic e g laitinen et al 2017 aspects additionally buonocore et al 2018 used lca to compare the environmental impacts of linear partially circular and circular scenarios of energy recovery and water reuse in wwtp leong et al 2019 compared the environmental lca and economic lcc impacts of centralized and decentralized options for non potable water uses at a domestic and commercial building similarly zanni et al 2019 compared the environmental impacts and other technical aspects e g system s complexity tanks pumping system etc of centralized and decentralized water systems at single dwelling and apartment buildings assessment of environmental impacts of the entire urban water system was investigated in the studies of lemos et al 2013 considering environmental impacts of lane et al 2015 comparing conventional to diversified urban water infrastructure and of xue et al 2019 considering both environmental and monetary costs however the above mentioned studies trying to address circularity issues by focusing mainly on the environmental impacts fall short of keeping water as the protagonist in terms of circularity i e there is no proof of closing the water loops thus they are not able to make an overall evaluation of the ce benefits i e elimination of waste and regeneration of natural capital it is also reported that the application of lca in complex multifunctional circular water value chains with multiple outputs i e water energy materials and water uses is still challenging reap et al 2008 bobba et al 2018 therefore although these studies have assessed aspects of circularity i e environmental impacts economic efficiency etc of different components of water systems they cannot holistically assess the circularity of water systems however lca if combined with other tools methods can provide useful information in terms of environmental sustainability as part of a water circularity assessment for example the ce principle of design out waste externalities can be assessed with lca especially if combined with lcc or other economic assessments to incorporate the economic aspects of the system additionally lca has been integrated to metabolic approaches in goldstein et al 2013 garcía guaita et al 2018 sohn et al 2018 in order to assess the sustainability of cities metabolisms considering the anthropogenic flows of different materials however to the best of our knowledge such methodological integration has not been performed to water related metabolisms 5 3 modelling approaches mfa based and consumption based approaches can be used to evaluate the circular metabolism i e in terms of water in both human and nature managed systems of energy and of nutrients mainly in human managed systems in a stationary snap shot mode and the potential environmental impacts of the entire life cycle to the environment respectively however the actual environmental impacts the environmental benefits and in general the degradation or regeneration of the natural environment e g considering the nutrients natural cycles is not well addressed therefore modelling approaches are reviewed in this sub section in order to bridge this gap by studying different material cycles simultaneously in addition to interpreting them individually while gaining insight into the magnitude of the associated flows the purpose is to present the state of the art of existing models as tools that can potentially be incorporated in assessment methodologies and existing methodologies deploying modelling approaches that can be used towards a holistic water circularity assessment process based and conceptual hydrologic and biogeochemical models have been developed to simulate the water and nutrients or solutes transport fate and cycling such models are based on a theoretical understanding of relevant ecological processes i e using partial differential equations kinetic laws stoichiometry and balance equations cuddington et al 2013 that enables the consideration of multiple and complex interactions between climate soil geology vegetation hydrology and nutrient balances in addition to this feature computer models interpret dynamically the analyzed system due to the inclusion of temporal and spatial variation and resolution in comparison to the stationary nature of the mfa and consumption based approaches however the main drawback of such models is the required amount of data field and experimental data and model results which increases with increasing mechanization of the model as well as the complexity of the model data intensive complex models impede their wide implementation and use thus more generic models are required that are simpler and easier to apply vadas et al 2013 the reviewed tools i e models are categorized according to their focus pure hydrological models focus on the quantification of the hydrological partitioning i e partitioning of precipitation into streamflow evapotranspiration and storage change agro hydrological models simulate hydrology agricultural water management and in some cases nutrient loads of agricultural areas hydro biochemical models simulate the transport fate and cycling of nutrients on soils and land use including agricultural areas starting with the reviewed hydrological models bellot and chirino 2013 developed an eco hydrological modelling approach i e hydrobal for assessing the water balance with a daily resolution more precisely hydrobal investigates the temporal variability in soil water content determined by vegetation water uptake as a function of climatic conditions i e daily rainfall and micrometeorological variables and the model outputs include actual evapotranspiration runoff and aquifer recharge deep percolation zhang et al 2020 developed a conceptual catchment water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis denoted pwbm to model the hydrological partitioning across spatial and temporal scales the pwbm model inputs require precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf area index and the model outputs are streamflow evapotranspiration and storage change westenbroek et al 2010 developed a modified thornthwaite mather soil water balance swb code combining geographic information system gis data layers and tabular climatological data to calculate spatial and temporal variations in groundwater recharge li et al 2017b developed a model integrating conceptual models in the vadose zone considering various landscape units e g farmland grassland surface water bare soil etc and the groundwater flow model feflow under gis to simulate the hydrological processes under various scenarios of water saving activities the model was applied in the heihe river basin in gansu province of china and validated by comparing the simulated evapotranspiration groundwater levels and the total water balance with remote sensing results previous studies and monitored data one of the most extensively used agro hydrological model at the field scale is the fao 56 dual crop coefficient fao 2kc allen et al 1998 model that estimates the crop water requirements by means of the simulated evapotranspiration and its two components i e evaporation and transpiration another agro hydrological model that can be used to investigate irrigation nutrient and salt management strategies is the research version of the swb model i e swb sci that is a mechanistic real time generic crop growth soil water nutrient and salt balance model annandale et al 1999 2000 van der laan et al 2010 2014 consisting of different sub modules e g water balance sub module and the nitrogen sub module the soil and water assessment tool swat simulates water quality and quantity the impact of land use management practices and climate change arnold et al 1998 arnold et al 2012 automatic irrigation algorithms in swat have been tested improved and validated to correctly simulate the hydrological processes in agricultural catchments in response to climate change and water management scenarios e g dechmi et al 2012 githui et al 2016 wei et al 2018 uniyal and dietrich 2019 hydro biogeochemical models simulate the transport fate and cycling of nutrients on agricultural areas and soils considering the interactions with the hydrological processes drainmod p deal et al 1986 tian et al 2012 askar 2019 hype lindström et al 2010 inca p wade et al 2002 jackson blake et al 2016 rzwqm2 p ma et al 2012 sadhukhan and qi 2018 and simply p jackson blake et al 2017 are some of the existing models focusing on the phosphorus transport in soils summarized in the review of pferdmenges et al 2020 the models presented here are the ones that are capable of simulating both surface diffusion desorption and erosion and subsurface infiltration and transport in soil phosphorus processes as well as phosphorus plant uptake additionally all the presented models include all the hydrological compartments i e surface water infiltration groundwater and streamflow which are important if water cycle is included in the analysis their differences mainly lie on the different water flow and solute transport approaches that they use e g storage routing representation or empirical or darcy or richards equations and single dual porosity and dual permeability etc and on the spatial scales i e soil profile plot field and catchment additionally the process based century model parton et al 1987 has been extensively used to dynamically estimate the soil organic carbon stocks the century model is designed to simulate carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur dynamics in natural or cultivated systems using a monthly time step parton et al 1988 shaffer et al 2001 allowing the simulation of the anthropogenic land management and natural climate and soil drivers with the possibility to assess the effect of alternative scenarios other models developed to track and estimate the carbon sequestrated or emitted from both plantations and managed native forests are the co2fix mohren and klein goldewijk 1990 gorcam schlamadinger et al 2000 and fullcam richards and evans 2004 waterworth et al 2007 the review of hydrological agro hydrological and hydro biogeochemical models revealed that there is a variety of available models capable of simulating the environmental processes of water and nutrients hydrological and agro hydrological models can provide more accurate quantification of the hydrological processes on different temporal scales daily monthly seasonal annual that can be used as inputs to water balance equations considering both anthropogenic and natural water flows in order to holistically assess the circularity of water systems biogeochemical models can shed light on the underestimated nutrients cycling in nature and carbon sequestration that would further improve the environmental and physical assessment of the system as well as the evaluation of the environmental benefits therefore such models can effectively include nbs as most of them use environmental processes to address societal challenges and can be used within a water circularity assessment methodology integrating the ecosystem perspective which is currently the missing element within the other reviewed approaches and methods however to the best of our knowledge these models have not been incorporated to water assessment methodologies thus indicators targeting at the ecosystems cannot be identified in this case the selection of the model to be incorporated in a water circularity assessment methodology is of major importance as models with high complexity would burden their wide use and adoption while very simplistic models would not accurately describe the system resulting in unrealistic conclusions the model should also be able to sufficiently and simultaneously describe the environmental processes of water and all nutrients in order to avoid the need of incorporating different models for different purposes which would result in high complexity and computational time attention should be given in case that such models are used in parallel with consumption based approaches such as lca as the actual environmental impacts resulting from the former and the potential impacts resulting from the latter may conflict with each other and be double counted the previously reviewed models have been used as standalone tools by the researchers villarroel walker 2010 developed a multi sectoral systems analysis msa methodology for understanding and managing the metabolism of complex systems supported by a set of socio ecological indicators the environmental model was coded in matlab incorporating substance flow analysis sfa and regionalized sensitivity analysis rsa in order to track and account for the movement of water energy nitrogen phosphorus and carbon into around and out of a regional city system considering multiple socio economic sectors i e water energy food forestry and waste management and the interactions amongst them however the focus of this study is on the production system rather than the water system itself with the developed indicators table 5 covering aspects of circularity i e the direct or indirect regeneration of natural capital and the design out waste externalities from its environmental dimension the indicators are not able to evaluate the principle of keeping resources in use by measuring the extent of closing the water energy and nutrients loops 6 compilation of findings the current review paper addressed two main questions regarding circularity in water systems what needs to be measured to assess water circularity and how can water circularity be measured the answer to the first question was found in the white papers of stuchtey 2015 iwa 2016 and arup et al 2018 and it is the realization of the three ce principles of natural capital regeneration keeping resources in use and designing out waste externalities the water nutrients and other materials as well as the energy pathways need to be followed within both human and nature managed systems arup et al 2018 this analysis would enable the consideration of physical natural and anthropogenic water nutrients materials and energy flows environmental actual impacts e g increase or loss of biodiversity and potential impacts e g global warming potential and economic e g eco efficiency aspects most of these aspects can be measured using already developed indicators table 6 regarding the second question a variety of existing methodologies and tools were identified that have been presently used to assess nbs for water management water systems and water related environmental compartments these methodologies are capable to measure the different aspects of water circularity as illustrated in table 6 the information given in table 6 can be used to get better insights on what is still missing to holistically assess the circularity of water systems the lack of a holistic water circularity assessment methodology is apparent as well as a water circularity assessment framework to rigidly frame the assessment methodologies however there is a variety of existing methods and tools that if incorporated are able to cover all the different aspects of circularity assessment in water systems additionally although a wide set of indicators exists in the literature covering most of the aspects of circularity indicators measuring the environmental performance of water systems in terms of natural nutrients cycles are still missing the existence of numerous indicators does not necessarily mean that they are capable of adequately and holistically measure circularity in water systems the development of a water circularity assessment methodology would prove their adequateness and a potential requirement for the use of new indicators 7 conclusions the concept of water circularity is not well addressed within the research community and there is an apparent lack of a water circularity assessment framework currently available circularity methodologies focusing mainly on the consumer goods sector are not easily transferable to the water sector a failure to adequately evaluate water circularity by considering both human managed and nature managed systems would result in scattered and fragmented actions insufficient to deal with the degradation of our most essential and valuable resource and of our natural capital in turn therefore the present study identifies the positioning of water within the ce concept and how nbs can enable the transition to ce by shedding light on what needs to be measured and how to measure water circularity nbs as human interventions to address societal challenges by enhancing natural processes can play a key role in re connecting nature to human managed water systems however researchers mainly focus on the technical performance of nbs and the evaluation of some of their co benefits the connection of nbs to the wider water system and environment water quantity issues as well as a holistic assessment methodology still remain gaps concerning the assessment methodologies of water systems mfa based approaches are capable of mapping all the natural and anthropogenic water and water related flows in a well defined system and provide a wide set of indicators however the natural cycles of nutrients are not holistically considered lca based approaches include well established indicators focusing on the potential environmental impacts of anthropogenic water systems but fall short both of showing the actual impacts and of incorporating natural elements in the assessment to bridge those gaps hydro biogeochemical models can be incorporated enabling the consideration of the natural environment in the assessment the selection of the appropriate model should be based both on its capability to consider different aspects and on its simplicity that would enable its wider use and application a question however remains on how to incorporate different methods and models within a holistic water systems circularity assessment therefore future research in the topic should address current challenges requirements limitations and barriers leading in the development of a water circularity assessment framework and enabling researchers and practitioners to
